Coming from a comedy styling much like that of films such as Airplane and Naked Gun but much more crude, comes Scary Movie, with it's jokes that are completely insane and plot that well, doesn't really make sense a lot of the time. I thought before I watched this that it looked like a movie I simply wouldn't like, but it surprised me, it is far far from perfect but still, a funny movie.It's all based around the fact the our main characters killed a man a year before and someone is out to get them all, but who?. Of course the story is just a rip off of Scream but that is the whole point, in fact at various times throughout it is alluded to. The narrative plays out like a child had tried to write a film but then some guys called the Wayans brothers came in and added some rude joke to the pot, oh and on that point about pot, well watch it and you'll see what I mean.The cast has people such as Anna Faris, Jon Abrahams, Shannon Elizabeth and of course Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans who all could of destroyed their careers here. I did though enjoy the cast, they mix the right amount of humour into the bad acting that when by the end, you don't know if they couldn't act or not. One of my favourite characters from this is Shorty played by Marlon Wayans who's stoner comedy is hilarious and makes some scenes truly laugh out loud. And on the point of laugh out loud moments, the scream masked murderer is hilarious, watch out for when their mask changes facial expressions, just very funny. That all said about the jokes, the film can be near hit and miss. It is true probably that this is way too crude and stupid to be OK but I felt it is, it's enjoyable, doesn't overstay it's welcome and as mentioned before, can have laugh out loud moments too. Sure the Wayans don't always make the best decisions in film and when your film has Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer co writing it, you may expect your movie's reputation to drop really low. A thing I think the Wayans do well here though is mix the crude with genuine jokes, not only is it a good parody of slasher movies, but can turn serious moments into hilarious ones in a second.Now who might like this movie, well of course this is right up some people's street when it comes to comedy, it's the kind of movie where you might expect a critic to recommend this to teens. The truth is though that teens or well maybe people who were teens when all these horror movies were around, will really enjoy it and probably laugh(well at least I hope as if you don't laugh at this there isn't much else to enjoy). Don't just watch this like you expect it to be bad, give it a go and like me you might be surprised how funny you found it.Overall a movie I personally found kind of OK, maybe wrestled with my thoughts a little as to whether it was pretty so-so but I think all in all it is funny enough to be mostly positive stuff. Wouldn't really say people who consider themselves connoisseurs of fine comedy would enjoy this but to the hell with most comedy, this is stupid enough to be fun to watch.

Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable? Or was I miserable because I listened to pop music?Stephen Frear's High Fidelity breaks the fourth wall from the very opening scene as Rob Gordon (John Cusack) begins sharing with us about his top 5 breakups right at the time his girlfriend, Laura (Iben Hjejle), is moving out of his apartment and leaving him. It is evident he is hurt, but he brushes it off by saying she doesn't even rank in his list of the most hurtful breakups. That is when he begins listing who each one of them were while we get flashbacks of those memories intertwined with the present in which we are introduced to his job, friends, and his passion for music. Rob is a vintage record store owner and his two employees, Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black), are as much music snobs as he is, and they too enjoy making lists of their favorite things usually involving music. The more we get to know Rob, we realize that he isn't the typical romantic character we'd find in a film like this. He is deeply flawed, he has cheated on his girlfriend, he doesn't seem to be going anywhere with his life, and he is afraid of commitment. Somehow he always believes to be the victim in the break-ups, but from what he says we know that he has never been boyfriend of the year material. It is hard to root for a character like Rob, but John Cusack delivers such a charismatic and engaging performance that we accept his flaws and want him to get over the heartbreak. Along the way he realizes that Laura really belongs on the list and decides to revisit some of his past flames to discover what he has been doing wrong. Frears has directed some great films (The Queen, Philomena), along with not so good ones that feel like direct to TV movies, but High Fidelity belongs in his top list of best films. It is a romantic comedy that has an entertaining script, some great performances, and of course a wonderful soundtrack. The screenplay was adapted from Nick Horny's book but instead of setting the story in London they bring it to Chicago and it absolutely works. Jack Black and Todd Louiso give strong supporting performances and you believe they actually are these snobs who are living music encyclopedias. They complement Cusack's performance and deliver most of the comedic moments. As for John Cusack I believe this is one of his best performances although I still need to see a couple more of his films to solidify that claim. The romance in High Fidelity is also incredibly believable and relatable which is hard to come across by in most rom-coms. Neither Cusack nor Hjejle are portrayed as these perfect role models in a relationship, they are both flawed characters who have made some poor decisions.Even though my music knowledge is very limited, I was able to relate to these characters because of their shared passion. I may not have that same passion for music, but I do for movies or sports so I understood where these characters were coming from and believed the culture this film created surrounding music. The screenwriters knew what they were writing about and each one of the actors delivered, and that is what has made High Fidelity such a cult favorite for many teens. It manages to be smart and funny at the same time. It is also one of the best examples of a film successfully being able to break the fourth wall and including the audience in the genius of the movie and its charm. http\/\/estebueno10.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"6 August 2015","score":"","review":" Nobody worries about kids listening to thousands, literally thousands of songs about heartbreak, rejection, pain, misery and loss.

In actual fact, the USSR just certainly participated in the most awful war of all time. And that was participation to full capacity, our land was lucky to have so much human and economic resources, that, paying little attention to casualties and even speaking about colossal casualties need with a plump 'YES'... In the both world wars' history there were neither the right nor the wrong, neither the defenders nor the aggressors, neither the conscientious nor the deceitful. What there were, was just overcrowded battlefields and tremendous massacres due to the super-powerful military blocs' confrontation. And Germany was against all. It is not just German propaganda! Because saying that Japan and Italy sufficiently helped the Reich to achieve, by 1942, impressing spreading over the larger part of Europe, from Norway, France, and Greece, eastwards to the Lower Volga, &#x97; would be, quite sure, a hypocrisy. The Germans (there is no denying their fantastic fighting spirit and self-denial), under their Führer, Hitler, an Austrian himself actually, would indeed approach the Superpower status &#x97; only to be eventually pulled up and occupied by the wartime allies whose coalition, however, dissolved shortly after. The former have gone down in history as the monstrous evil fanatics, tormentors of peoples, and what of it? image of the enemy (especially of the shattered one) is likely to be demonised, and since the war was the most monstrous one, the demonisation was likely to reach the unparalleled extent. Jews, alas, have always been destroyed; antisemitism has still not ceased to exist. Shootings of civilian population and property destruction by advancing or retreating troops used to take place on any war and still does. When the war was over, the German and the Japanese rulers were dismissed and they were in the dock, accused of 'war crimes', but that was because the winner is always right and judges the beaten. Just a decorum of diplomacy. I even wonder why so many people still believe that was really a holy violence and a fair trial. And the current war, Donbass war, must wipe out the rose-coloured view of victory in the anti-Nazi war, as Nazism then was not a simple and unambiguous enemy, and there was no deathnail for it then. Today, some heavy-metal songs from the turn of the 1980s and 1990s are extremely topical again. As they describe bombing; warn that just as decades ago the Nazi Germany recarved the map of Europe, sparks of crematory fire of death camps are still visible; narrate the stories of hirelings of dirty tricks and monkey business. In fact, I, just a teenager that time, foresaw that revanchism, that came up in our pluralism age together with any other 'dissenting opinions', would lead to no good... But the Germans are just the ones who least of all stick to their demands in this regard! And the world is lucky to have SUCH Germans today, as otherwise, it might be a World War III with once more 'Germany against all' - and doomsday! However, Germany at the moment needs revanchism like one needs a hole in the head. Who eulogise it, are rulers of Eastern European states as it is a safe bet of giving up everything that connects with Russia, the parent state, and that is none of Germany's business. But how are we Russians going to solve the current pending problem, &#x97; that is the challenge. We would be lucky to have the majority once again, as in 1941, been convinced of being victorious 'victors need never explain'... But what if not?..Having grounded the significance and topicality of this film, I am going to describe its advantages. This old film measures itself against many modern war films as well as it is still thrilling-to-watch. Almost no 'tall tale' but striking accent when meeting almost any Russian characters (bit parts). Why not involve Russians in auding. There have always been millions of those abroad ('Iron Curtain' is also just a cliché shown to the best advantage by certain circle, isn't it?). The female unit episode is certainly a shocksploitation, but there is a black sheep in every flock. And why, the Western filmmakers showed the Soviet female warrior not just as an abusive woman who immediately laid her arms down and gave in to the Germans.

What affected my choice, was, perhaps, the current situation, when, with the outbreak of the most recent war, I have been getting more and more uneasy about the thought, that the previous war was, in fact, far less unambiguous than the banal cliché 'Great Partiotic War', what we call it in Russia meaning homespun truth 'we had been under attack &#x97; so we stroke back'. In actual fact, the USSR just certainly participated in the most awful war of all time. And that was participation to full capacity, our land was lucky to have so much human and economic resources, that, paying little attention to casualties and even speaking about colossal casualties need with a plump 'YES'... In the both world wars' history there were neither the right nor the wrong, neither the defenders nor the aggressors, neither the conscientious nor the deceitful. What there were, was just overcrowded battlefields and tremendous massacres due to the super-powerful military blocs' confrontation. And Germany was against all. It is not just German propaganda! Because saying that Japan and Italy sufficiently helped the Reich to achieve, by 1942, impressing spreading over the larger part of Europe, from Norway, France, and Greece, eastwards to the Lower Volga, &#x97; would be, quite sure, a hypocrisy. The Germans (there is no denying their fantastic fighting spirit and self-denial), under their Führer, Hitler, an Austrian himself actually, would indeed approach the Superpower status &#x97; only to be eventually pulled up and occupied by the wartime allies whose coalition, however, dissolved shortly after. The former have gone down in history as the monstrous evil fanatics, tormentors of peoples, and what of it? image of the enemy (especially of the shattered one) is likely to be demonised, and since the war was the most monstrous one, the demonisation was likely to reach the unparalleled extent. Jews, alas, have always been destroyed; antisemitism has still not ceased to exist. Shootings of civilian population and property destruction by advancing or retreating troops used to take place on any war and still does. When the war was over, the German and the Japanese rulers were dismissed and they were in the dock, accused of 'war crimes', but that was because the winner is always right and judges the beaten. Just a decorum of diplomacy. I even wonder why so many people still believe that was really a holy violence and a fair trial. And the current war, Donbass war, must wipe out the rose-coloured view of victory in the anti-Nazi war, as Nazism then was not a simple and unambiguous enemy, and there was no deathnail for it then. Today, some heavy-metal songs from the turn of the 1980s and 1990s are extremely topical again. As they describe bombing; warn that just as decades ago the Nazi Germany recarved the map of Europe, sparks of crematory fire of death camps are still visible; narrate the stories of hirelings of dirty tricks and monkey business. In fact, I, just a teenager that time, foresaw that revanchism, that came up in our pluralism age together with any other 'dissenting opinions', would lead to no good... But the Germans are just the ones who least of all stick to their demands in this regard! And the world is lucky to have SUCH Germans today, as otherwise, it might be a World War III with once more 'Germany against all' - and doomsday! However, Germany at the moment needs revanchism like one needs a hole in the head. Who eulogise it, are rulers of Eastern European states as it is a safe bet of giving up everything that connects with Russia, the parent state, and that is none of Germany's business. But how are we Russians going to solve the current pending problem, &#x97; that is the challenge. We would be lucky to have the majority once again, as in 1941, been convinced of being victorious 'victors need never explain'... But what if not?..Having grounded the significance and topicality of this film, I am going to describe its advantages. This old film measures itself against many modern war films as well as it is still thrilling-to-watch. Almost no 'tall tale' but striking accent when meeting almost any Russian characters (bit parts). Why not involve Russians in auding. There have always been millions of those abroad ('Iron Curtain' is also just a cliché shown to the best advantage by certain circle, isn't it?). The female unit episode is certainly a shocksploitation, but there is a black sheep in every flock. And why, the Western filmmakers showed the Soviet female warrior not just as an abusive woman who immediately laid her arms down and gave in to the Germans. Instead, this composite character is shown as a female hero who combats the enemy many times superior, ready to sell her life and honour dearly...But the Germans are main characters here. They are neither protagonists here, nor those who are praised and white-washed. We see them such as they must have been on that war. Soviet posters showed them next to trench rats with arms round each other, and quite similar to each other, and that was not just propaganda. No military bearing in the war it is at the parade where a fighter is clean-shaven, and wears full-dress uniform, and is in blanched boots! While in trenches, even the question of insignia is often of no importance. (Because an officer who keeps subordination too zealously takes chances to have his own soldiers got rid of him). So some exclusively brave Wehrmacht soldiers would wear trophy Red Army garments, give higher commanders a piece of mind, pardon Soviet captives and even exchange defeatist views, wishing Hitler himself 'kaputt'!

They are 1949's The Heiress (my personal favourite), 1961's The Innocents and this.It is hard to decide where to begin praising The Wings of the Dove, but a definite starting point would be the production values. Simply put, The Wings of the Dove is not only one of the most visually stunning films personally seen in recent memory but also one of the most beautiful ever, strongly reminiscent of a Merchant-Ivory film. It's exquisitely shot, especially in the Venetian scenes and the final scene between Millie and Merton, the settings and period detail are so colourful and evocative and The Wings of the Dove has to contain some of the best and jaw-droppingly amazing costume design in all of film. The sensitive and beautifully elegant music score and rightly restrained direction also add a great deal.Hossein Amini received an Oscar nomination for the film's script, and it is not hard to see why. It is a literate, deliciously dark and beautifully nuanced script that is never devoid of emotion, and adapts very difficult source material remarkably cleverly and with utmost coherence. The story is deliberate in pace, but dark and poignant- the latter scenes being incredibly powerful emotionally- and it is throughout told with complete control and respect for James' work. It also succeeds brilliantly as a mood piece, the darkness, poignancy and lyricism very well brought out. The characters also fascinate, compellingly real and human rather than labelled just good and bad.The Wings of the Dove contains fine performances, with that of Helena Bonham Carter ranking among the year's and her best, her character makes some questionable decisions to put it lightly but the many nuances Bonham Carter brings to the role allows one to really sympathise with her and understand why she makes them. Allison Elliot was also charming and heart-breaking in a role that easily could have been played annoyingly or blandly in lesser hands, and Linus Roache handles the hardest role of the whole film and story very, very well.

The movie has the Nazi's and the Mob in hot pursuit of the secret Rocket Pack built by Howard Hughes. During the 40s, there were rumors about a famous Hollywood actor being a Nazi sympathizer or Bundist as they were called.

Dalton has a terrifying gorilla working for him, with his mob friends, led by Paul Sorvino of GoodFellas fame. The movie moves quickly and has very few slow parts. The rocket flying parts are very well down, even today. The finale on the Nazi blimp, has to be seen to be believed. Arkin, Sorvino and Dalton anchor the two shaky leads. This is what really hurt the movie, both Campbell and Connoly are dreadful actors. Cast for their looks, it was a bad choice to have both of the leads stink it up. The supporting cast is good, but they just are not on the screen that much. There is some levity in spots but on the whole it is a serious action movie way out of Disney's genre. I own the movie for its non stop action, great effects and the fact that the movie will grow on you. I hated it in 1991, but the more I watch it the better it gets. There were also lots of other big movies released with it and The Rocketeer got lost in the crowd. There are some mid air flying sequences that are truly breathtaking; Arkin is very good in the movie. If he had not been in this role, it would have been so much worse.

A great scene is where Campbell is trying to get a message to Connolly and he is the world's worst waiter.

After a serious operation, Arnold still is more than capable on delivering the action. He also gave an excellent, character driven performance. He definitely held his own against great dramatic actors Kevin Pollak(his cop partner\/best friend) and Gabriel Byrne(the physical embodiment of Satan). Gabriel Byrne gives an Oscar worthy performance as fallen angel Lucifer. His presence and performance is remarkable and he brings a lot of class to a production that relies heavily on action and special f\/x. The support cast is very strong also. Although I feel that this could have been done better, End Of Days is still pretty entertaining and you could do much worst for an evening's entertainment.

Due to its involving and breath-taking story along with impressive performances. The plot even having some similarities with the first movie isn't remotely predictable or boring. The tension, the soundtrack and how the action scenes were shot provided a feeling of always look up your shoulder because something is after you. But the film is not only actions scenes, in the interval between the action scenes, the characters have their chance to be explored and developed making each one have a good and solid identity during the entire picture. One aspect which is new is the humour, the relationship between John Connor (Edward Furlong) and the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is responsible for this to happen. Other point worth mentioning is the visual effects, specially the makeup used in the T-800 is so realistic, at times there is a certain discomfort because you know that action would hurt, but as he is a robot, that is nothing. Regarding the cast, their performance was incredible. Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) suffered a change both physically and mentally, she's no longer the naive and helpless woman from the first movie, now she is willing to do anything so John can survive. Arnold once again is great in the role, Edward Furlong plays a troubled and rebel John Connor. Throughout the film a bond is created between John and the T-800 and surely it's one of the highlights. It's so funny and amusing see the growth of the odd friendship, a man with a machine.

At that time I was not a great admirer of Soavi, perhaps because I was hoping for Dario Argento Jr. and got something different. Since becoming a huge fan of Dellamorte Dellamore (1994), however, I've been planning to re-watch his other films, and now I'm finally getting around to it. This is Soavi's feature debut - before this he cut his teeth as assistant director to Argento, Lamberto Bava, and Joe D'Amato - and here we can see the influence of these various mentors. The flamboyant camera-work and imagery certainly bring Argento to mind, while the premise (an acting troupe gets locked inside a theater with a serial killer) is reminiscent of Bava's Demons (1985). The material isn't so similar to D'Amato's work, but we have him to thank for the film's existence (and for Soavi's directorial career, since he was perfectly content to remain an assistant director), since he produced it and hired Soavi.As a director Soavi hadn't quite found his own voice yet - he's very imitative of Argento here - but to his credit he conjures imagery worthy of the master. No one who has seen this film will forget the bizarre owl mask donned by the killer (an image that would not be out of place in Franju's Judex), and the scene of him sitting on stage with the posed bodies of his victims, tranquilly stroking a cat as feathers descend on them like snowflakes, is one of the most indelible in the whole of Italian horror. What already sets Soavi apart from Argento is his cheeky humor. The comic relief scenes in Argento's films generally come across as rather clumsy and awkward (e.g. the befuddled mailman from Four Flies on Grey Velvet), but Soavi is consistently clever. The opening scene, for instance, thwarts our expectations to great comic effect. Still Soavi knows how to stage an effective death scene, and he doesn't hold back on the red stuff, but even the most horrible scenes tend to have a touch of black humor. One bit I particularly liked involved one of the characters spilling stage-blood all over the dressing room; as their friend is drilled to death, his blood starts to drip onto the fake stuff. I can't help but wonder if this is a tongue-in-cheek criticism of the phony-looking blood in most Italian horror films.The cast is quite strong Barbara Cupisti is a sympathetic heroine, David Brandon is brilliant as the temperamental director (perhaps Soavi was drawing on his experiences with Argento here), and Giovanni Lombardo Radice is pretty amusing as a flamboyantly gay actor. Special praise must be singled out to the actor playing the silent masked killer (IMDb claims that it's exploitation legend George Eastman), who projects great presence simply through the use of his body language - I'd favorably compare him to Lon Chaney.The experience between my first and second viewings of this little gem is truly night and day. This is not just an astoundingly good film for a first time director, but a minor masterpiece of the genre. Dario Argento must have thought so as well; Opera bears some striking similarities to it, and Argento would subsequently enlist Soavi to direct The Church (1989) and The Sect (1991).

Like his other pictures, it takes a simple premise and puts the audience through the wringer as to how it will turn out. Here, James Stewart plays L.B. Jefferies, a wheelchair-bound photojournalist who passes the time by looking at his neighbors through the rear window of his apartment. However, based on some things he sees, he begins to think that a murder may have been committed. Having just come off of ROPE, where the film was edited to appear as one single take, I noticed another technical challenge with this. The entire view the audience is given is from Jeff's apartment, which essentially forces us into his perspective. We see exactly what he sees, and know what he knows (with a few exceptions). In the hands of a weaker director, having basically only one fully developed character would have resulted in a very weak film, but Hitchcock makes it work somehow. It also doesn't hurt that James Stewart has a likable screen presence. And boy, is Grace Kelly easy on the eyes (and a talented actress, too)! However, what made the film so much more interesting was the social commentary that Hitchcock flirted with for part of the running time. Most of it is contained in some first-half conversations between Jeff and his girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly). Although I could just be reading this onto the film, it seems like Jeff's apartment-bound snoop is a metaphor for society's growing passivity. This is kind of supported by the fact that he's averse to getting married, is content with the status quo, etc. This is in contrast to his girlfriend, who is more ambitious. It's almost tragically ironic that they end up bonding over a murder they think has been committed based on their limited point of view from Jeff's apartment. Also, given the interconnectedness that the internet provides, and the privacy concerns that come along with it, one could certainly read the ethics of surveillance onto the film as well. Even if that wasn't the intention (and Hitchcock's primary concern was entertainment), you can certainly see how the film was prescient in that regard. Just substitute the digital world for the apartment complex, where you think that you know people based on what they post on Facebook. If anything, you can take away that life is better experienced than merely observed. However, my only minor complaint has to do with the ending (again). Hitchcock is a master when it comes to building tension and suspense, but after so much cinematic foreplay there wasn't enough time to savor the release when it comes. I will say that Raymond Burr, even though you only got really one scene to appreciate his character up close, was quite menacing. There were also lots of cool little moments that you get to see as Jeff spies on his neighbors. And, I was able to catch Hitchcock's cameo this time! From my limited perspective of only having seen a handful of Hitchcock's films at this point, I can still safely say that this is the best so far.

It would be impossible to market, but it would be an interesting study in deconstructing all the oddities in Weir's direction and Biziou's cinematography. Their work in creating the world of Seahaven is done with excruciating care and detail much like the work of god-figure and showrunner Christof. Thousands of extras and covert cameras, a gigantic dome complete with artificial moon and sun, 400 life sized buildings, props and costumes of all kinds...But Biziou also injects a sense of hyper realism into the film. The use of high key lighting, the scenes slightly over-lit create a subtle and controlled sense of artificiality. It's combined with the voyeuristic photography; sneaky povs from behind car dashes and vending machines and cupboards, vignetted frames suggesting surveillance, the way the edits will bounce from normal compositions to handhelds from the likes of Meryl's necklace or the neighbour's trash-cam. The almost too pristine and perfect production design of Seahaven's architecture and sets provides a lived in and yet unnatural world that Truman resides in.Laura Linney is the consummate professional, Hannah Gill, who in turn beats out 5 other actresses to land the star role of Meryl, Truman's college sweetheart and eventual wife. There's plenty of love and sincerity punctuated briefly by moments of consciousness and recognition. Linney portrays these moments with such genuineness. A nervous glance at the hidden camera at the back of the car as Truman goes for maniacal joyride, or the nuance of the startled expression and scoff that she quickly struggles to hide when Truman confronts her You can't stand me...That's not true! But she quickly re- establishes the veneer and takes the opportunity to parade another product for the millions of viewers. On several occasions, her sweetness is turned up to 11 and the camera quickly and eagerly zooms her satisfaction (and a clear view of the product name). Ed Harris' Christof doesn't seek to hide the nature of his feelings; the first extended sequence has him pulling all the strings from a sleek and moody studio in the sky, heavily contrasting the cheerful Seahaven. He expertly guides the broadcast for maximum emotional attachment, but is himself distant. In the final scenes, we are treated to an almost tearful monologue, a last plea from the father figure to his son, beckoning him to turn back into his loving arms. Harris plays this part out with such a tender sincerity that it's easy to forget his showrunner persona (the character of Marlon was once given cancer amidst contract disputes). In the bathroom or the shower there are no cameras, and the sex scenes are only hinted at, but ironically Christof has no real regard for his son's privacy. There's still complexity and depth; after several lighting strikes and a violent storm, Christof witnesses Truman's heroics (There's our hero shot) and relents. The Truman Show could be described as satirical, but also prophetic in a way. After all, the international hit Big Brother only debuted the following year, but even that never hit the heights of Truman's audience. It's clearly exaggerated in size and scope, but the real question is, by how much? Roger Ebert makes a telling point; even a decade ago you would not see the likes of celebrity culture focused so intensely on subjects like Snooki or Honey Boo Boo. These days we have that in materialistic excess, entranced by the manufactured stories and plots and the high turnover rate, obsessed by every detail of their lives. If 20 million can watch the Neighbours wedding episode and millions more watch the royal wedding of 2011, how many would tune in to a real life Truman special wedding episode, especially with someone as accomplished as Christof to elicit the maximum emotional connection? I really like the role of Natascha McElhone as Sylvia, as a college extra who falls in love with Truman. It would have been easy to limit her character as just a unrequited love, but she eventually transforms into a protester of sorts, frequently calling in and pushing her agenda Free Truman. It's such a pinpoint reflection of reality; it would be exactly the sort of protest group that would form if a Truman Show replica existed in our world, with the ever raging controversial debates on free will and the ethical and moral implications of such a show. The scary thing is that apart from Sylvia the world is sparse of this sort of concern; the parallel edits of the various fans of the show in different locations cheer and look on with hope and horror as Truman attempts his sea escape, and they burst into applause when he speaks his famous catchphrase and exits Seahaven...and then they switch channels and look for another source of entertainment. They are, like many reality show fans, hugely invested in Truman as a character, but oblivious to his nature as a real human being. I wonder how the film would play out with a more serious actor; whether Weir would forgo some comedic elements and add more drama, but then you lose the charm and appeal of Carrey in scenes like the beach pizza shop and the mirror astronaut play-acting. But even then, it doesn't matter. The illusion is never shattered; the audience only care for the final catchphrase. Linney and the fake making-of documentary reveal a little insight on the character of Gill; as a child actress who finally hits stardom and is very concerned with the nature of her contract. She's managed to negotiate a sizeable payment every time Meryl and Truman have sex. It's very easy to focus on that rather than the heartbreaking revelation that Truman is faced with at the end of the film.

The almost too pristine and perfect production design of Seahaven's architecture and sets provides a lived in and yet unnatural world that Truman resides in.Laura Linney is the consummate professional, Hannah Gill, who in turn beats out 5 other actresses to land the star role of Meryl, Truman's college sweetheart and eventual wife. There's plenty of love and sincerity punctuated briefly by moments of consciousness and recognition. Linney portrays these moments with such genuineness. A nervous glance at the hidden camera at the back of the car as Truman goes for maniacal joyride, or the nuance of the startled expression and scoff that she quickly struggles to hide when Truman confronts her You can't stand me...That's not true! But she quickly re- establishes the veneer and takes the opportunity to parade another product for the millions of viewers. On several occasions, her sweetness is turned up to 11 and the camera quickly and eagerly zooms her satisfaction (and a clear view of the product name). Ed Harris' Christof doesn't seek to hide the nature of his feelings; the first extended sequence has him pulling all the strings from a sleek and moody studio in the sky, heavily contrasting the cheerful Seahaven. He expertly guides the broadcast for maximum emotional attachment, but is himself distant. In the final scenes, we are treated to an almost tearful monologue, a last plea from the father figure to his son, beckoning him to turn back into his loving arms. Harris plays this part out with such a tender sincerity that it's easy to forget his showrunner persona (the character of Marlon was once given cancer amidst contract disputes). In the bathroom or the shower there are no cameras, and the sex scenes are only hinted at, but ironically Christof has no real regard for his son's privacy. There's still complexity and depth; after several lighting strikes and a violent storm, Christof witnesses Truman's heroics (There's our hero shot) and relents. The Truman Show could be described as satirical, but also prophetic in a way. After all, the international hit Big Brother only debuted the following year, but even that never hit the heights of Truman's audience. It's clearly exaggerated in size and scope, but the real question is, by how much? Roger Ebert makes a telling point; even a decade ago you would not see the likes of celebrity culture focused so intensely on subjects like Snooki or Honey Boo Boo. These days we have that in materialistic excess, entranced by the manufactured stories and plots and the high turnover rate, obsessed by every detail of their lives. If 20 million can watch the Neighbours wedding episode and millions more watch the royal wedding of 2011, how many would tune in to a real life Truman special wedding episode, especially with someone as accomplished as Christof to elicit the maximum emotional connection? I really like the role of Natascha McElhone as Sylvia, as a college extra who falls in love with Truman. It would have been easy to limit her character as just a unrequited love, but she eventually transforms into a protester of sorts, frequently calling in and pushing her agenda Free Truman. It's such a pinpoint reflection of reality; it would be exactly the sort of protest group that would form if a Truman Show replica existed in our world, with the ever raging controversial debates on free will and the ethical and moral implications of such a show. The scary thing is that apart from Sylvia the world is sparse of this sort of concern; the parallel edits of the various fans of the show in different locations cheer and look on with hope and horror as Truman attempts his sea escape, and they burst into applause when he speaks his famous catchphrase and exits Seahaven...and then they switch channels and look for another source of entertainment. They are, like many reality show fans, hugely invested in Truman as a character, but oblivious to his nature as a real human being. I wonder how the film would play out with a more serious actor; whether Weir would forgo some comedic elements and add more drama, but then you lose the charm and appeal of Carrey in scenes like the beach pizza shop and the mirror astronaut play-acting. But even then, it doesn't matter. The illusion is never shattered; the audience only care for the final catchphrase. Linney and the fake making-of documentary reveal a little insight on the character of Gill; as a child actress who finally hits stardom and is very concerned with the nature of her contract. She's managed to negotiate a sizeable payment every time Meryl and Truman have sex. It's very easy to focus on that rather than the heartbreaking revelation that Truman is faced with at the end of the film.

It would be impossible to market, but it would be an interesting study in deconstructing all the oddities in Weir's direction and Biziou's cinematography. Their work in creating the world of Seahaven is done with excruciating care and detail much like the work of god-figure and showrunner Christof. Thousands of extras and covert cameras, a gigantic dome complete with artificial moon and sun, 400 life sized buildings, props and costumes of all kinds...But Biziou also injects a sense of hyper realism into the film.

This movie is sharp, creepy, weird, thrilling and really, really good. I am still thinking about it days after watching it. Some of the film is even left to interpretation by the viewer so there is even more to figure out. The movie is about Sy, a photo clerk at a super store. Sy(short for Seymour) played by Robin Williams is a typical man in his 40's\/50's that is a nice, lovable, loser that lives alone. His loneliness turns him mad. He becomes obsessed with a family (Nina, Will, and Jake) that regularly gets their photos developed by him. He makes copies of their photos and puts them on the wall of his apartment. He is so lonely that he dreams of being a part of this family. He buys the same book that he sees sticking out of Nina's bag at the store. At first, he wanted to be like an uncle to the family but then later on he wants to marry Nina and get rid of her husband Will. One of the creepiest parts of the movie is when Sy watches the family's son Jake (Dylan Smith) play soccer from the sidelines and acts like an uncle.Sy eventually gets in trouble for using the extra film to make the copies of the family photos and gets fired for it by his boss (Gary Cole). Sy completely loses his mind at this point, and is determined to get rid of Will by filming his infidelity. Without giving it all away, the ending is wild. I would say the first half of the movie is better than the second but I'm nitpicking.8.5\/10 Very intense, very creepy. Williams at his best in my opinion. Not necessarily his best acting but his best character fit. Kudos to the director and supporting cast as well, it was very well done. Thrilling atmosphere and excellent music.

Geena Davis plays Veronica Quaife, a reporter who becomes the first person to know of Brundle's top secret project.The problem? Brundle is only able to teleport inanimate objects. His attempts to teleport living things provide Cronenberg with his first chance to indulge in his affinity for stomach- churning gore.The solution to Brundle's problem is given after Cronenberg indulges in his second affinity the flesh. Brundle and Veronica quickly (but very believably) fall for each other and after making love for the first time, Brundle figures out a way to make his machine work. During a celebration, Veronica leaves to keep her former boss, Stathis, from publishing a story about Brundle's revolutionary creation. Drunk, jealous and upset, Brundle decides to finally test his machine on himself.And this is where a mix between science fiction and romance turns into full-blown horror. It's only later that Brundle discovers that the machine insists on inner purity, meaning that only one living thing can be in the machine at a time. Tragically, a common housefly was in the machine with Brundle during his first teleportation and the machine, unable to teleport two living things at the same time, spliced the two together on the molecular\/genetic level.In the 1958 original, this led to an instant transformation that nowadays seems like a typical schlocky B-movie monster trope, but in Cronenberg's version, we get a torturously slow- paced transformation from a likable and fairly innocent scientist into a grotesque, deformed mutant.Often considered Cronenberg's masterpiece, The Fly uses Seth's transformation as allegory for the aging process, terminal illness, and death. The flesh, or the body as a whole, is constantly betraying us, and that's universal fear that The Fly taps into unlike any other film. The horror doesn't come from there being a monster it's the man BECOMING the monster that scares us half to death. The true horror, however, is in watching characters whom we come to like go through something so terrible. As I said, Jeff Goldblum is at his absolute best here, making us grow to love Seth Brundle's childlike enthusiasm and innocence so that when he begins to change, we can only feel fear for him. His performance as the unchanged Brundle is wonderful, but once Brundle is transformed, he kicks into high gear. Every twitch and every movement from his gnarled body tells the story, and it's impossible to take your eyes off of him even when the movie itself becomes nigh impossible to watch.Geena Davis also gives one of the finest performances of her career in what could have easily been a rather bland love interest. Her chemistry with Goldblum is so natural that the love story, as rushed as it may be, is never doubted for a second. In Davis's hands, Veronica is both the audience's avatar for the horror that unfolds and the voice of reason for Seth. It's Veronica that first notices the signs of Seth's change and it's her unwavering desire to save him that makes it so heartbreaking when we realize that she can't. Davis has always had an irresistible charisma and it shines, making her anguish all the more horrible to watch.When I say horrible to watch, don't for a second think that I mean this movie is unwatchable. Quite the contrary; it's one of the few movies that I can watch over and over again and never get tired of. But it goes without saying that this movie features the most gory effects I've ever seen. The makeup deserved the Oscar and it is definitely not for the squeamish. Broken arms and mutilated baboons are one thing, but when Brundle's fingernails start to come off, you can guarantee most of the audience will be covering their eyes. I could go on about this movie for days, but to sum things up, The Fly is one of the greatest science fiction films ever made, it's one of the greatest horror films ever made, and it's one of the greatest tragic romances ever made. There is so much to praise and there is so much to talk about. It's one of my favorite movies of all time, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it too. Just be sure to keep the vomit bags close by.

How can a momentary change in an actor's countenance constitute one of the of the great moments in film? I don't know, but Newman manages it here.He just smiles, he manages one of the most classic 5 mile stares ever, and doesn't even appear to notice the outcome. He KNOWS he made the shot before he even made it. Just that one moment is so brilliant every time I watch the film I play it through about 5 times before I go on.And then there is the great ending as the credits role and everyone vacates the pool room, one by one. Kenyon Hopkins should have won some kind of award for the music he provided for just that one scene.The final sax note and strummed guitar chord when the film stops rolling is like the end of a great symphony. A never to be matched ending to one of the greatest masterpieces ever in the history of American film making.

Its a great story behind it and also a good producers and actors. This is one of the movies that everyone should have seen at least once from the classics. The premise In chaotic 16th Century of Japan as marauders threaten raid,rob and destroy villages, one village hires samurai to help them defend it from a group of bandits. Also scenery and film locations are chosen with care and the wardrobe designers have done a awesome job with everything. Quotes from Akira Kurosawa With a good script, a good director can produce a masterpiece. With the same script, a mediocre director can produce a passable film. But with a bad script even a good director can't possibly make a good film. For truly cinematic expression, the camera and the microphone must be able to cross both fire and water. The script must be something that has the power to do this.

A riveting tale based upon the undying spirit of mid 70's America. Altman, with an ensemble in top-form, deliver a film that's entirely engrossing.'Nashville' Synopsis Over the course of a few hectic days, numerous interrelated people prepare for a political convention as secrets and lies are surfaced and revealed.'Nashville' is about people & their actions towards the society we live in. Its all about people exploring themselves, with politics & music as its satire. Altman handles this extremely ambitious story, with panache. He has directed the film, that's nothing short of a magnum-opus. The Legendary Filmmaker has handled each & every sequence, with detailing & maturity. Joan Tewkesbury's Screenplay is eventful, as much as its melancholic. I was moved by the journey of its multiple, multi-faced characters. Its interesting to see so many characters within one story, with each standing out, due to their diversities. 'Nashville' boasts a magnificent ensemble & all the actors pitch in tremendous performances. But, the one performer who stands out, its Lily Tomlin. In her portrayal of Linnea, a gospel singer, a wife & the loving mother of two deaf children, Tomlin gets into the skin of the character & delivers what truly can be defined as a masterclass in acting.On the whole, 'Nashville' is a richly made classic.

And since it is currently 2015, I am still waiting to see anything close to flying cars, let alone a hover-board item that can do more than have motorized wheels that you balance back and forth, and actually hovers running less like a Power Wheels product.The 2015 part was rather amusing when they saw Arnold Schwarzenegger having been President, when they weren't that far-off when he had been the Governor of California. Today, it almost makes you wonder if this movie had been a part in Schwarzenegger's original concept for governor.This movie does get a little slow at points, but (as Marty explains while knocking out Biff), Back to the Future II is a fun movie to watch. One more thing they did was rather amusing, the picture in the movie's ending was labeled directly to the trilogy's incoming ending to be concluded.
