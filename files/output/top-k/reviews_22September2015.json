When I heard that it was a sequel to THE HUSTLER, one of my all-time favourite movies, and directed by Martin Scorsese, I had to see it. Sadly, the result was a disappointment, hardly a sequel in the truest sense of the word. Sure, its main character is a pool player named Eddie Felson and he is played by Paul Newman, just as in the first film. Okay, up to that point. But beyond that, there is absolutely nothing to suggest that young Eddie Felsen and the older, more mature Eddie Felsen is even the same person. Too many background details are either forgotten or ignored, not the least of which was his thrashing of Minnesota Fats, an expert pool player who remained undefeated for more than fifteen years, making him the man to be reckoned with. Surely that is the stuff of legend &#x96; at least among pool players who take the game seriously &#x96; yet no one seems to even be aware of it in the second movie. In fact, the name Minnesota Fats doesn't even enter the conversation. Nor is it explained what turns Felson's life took after his acrimonious split with manager Bert Gordon (George C. Scott, in the original) who vowed that he would never shoot big-time pool again. And Eddie lives alone now. Does he ever have any regret about the shabby way he treated his girlfriend (Piper Laurie) who was driven to suicide and best friend (Myron McCormack) who he dumped along the way in his incessant drive to be the best?Such questions deserve at least a nodding reference, but none come into play and what we are left with is a fairly standard story of a liquor salesman (Newman) who occasionally plays pool and decides to mentor a young gun, Vincent (Tom Cruise), to hustle high-stakes games and split the take. Inevitably the two must square off to find out who is best.Newman is okay here, though hardly the electrifying performer we have come to expect over the years. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is good as Carmen, Vincent's girlfriend who likes the excitement of being around him and around the pool halls. But Tom Cruise, as the young hotshot with the pool stick, quickly becomes annoying with his excessive brand of cockiness.On its own, THE COLOR OF MONEY is well enough made and not without interest, but as a sequel it misses the mark by a wide margin.

Outside the building, he set a falcon free. Like the falcon, he's now free and with a wide world in front of him. Unlike the bird, caught by a raptor in plein air, the idealist young man finds a way to land some place and make a new life for himself. And that's when he's idealistic flight will find a frightening detour. Christopher Boyce (played by Timothy Hutton) is the man in question who gets the chance to work to a civilian defense contractor, dealing with many U.S. classified operations. Everything's fine, until the day some CIA cables start to come his way, accidentally, revealing important informations on how the U.S. government interferes with a constitutional crisis happening in Australia. His next course of action? With Cold War still going strong, he joins his crazed\/delusional drug dealer friend Andrew Daulton Lee (Sean Penn), who'll help him spreading information to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico, (country in which Lee comes and goes with no difficulty) in exchange of money. And that's when everything gets complicated.Hutton personifies the combative ideal and also the doubt. He doesn't feel as if betraying his country, he still considers himself as a patriot. However, the doubt is the one that kills us. Is he selling the secrets, satellite images and projects because of the money?; or it's simply because of the thrill of it all, the excitement is seeing if he can commit dangerous acts without getting caught? Or even maybe because he truly believes that his government and its agencies deserve some punishment for messing up with democracies around the world? While Boyce enjoys his activities, Lee is the one who makes things more complicated each scene goes by. Followed by the justice department after a drug bust, his only salvation is this espionage enterprise where he personally sells the secrets to the Soviets, represented by Alex (David Suchet), a member of the Embassy, who buys all the info that doesn't seem so important as they think. That's where we ask ourselves is it worth all the risk? The information sent to them was helpful in what way? The true story about Boyce and Lee, both convicted in acts of espionage and selling secrets to the Soviets is a treaty on how idealism can be a pointless yet dangerous thing when a person follows such ideal without having a clue on how to do it right. What's clearly evidenced here is that Boyce has some valid points on why sharing secret informations with the URSS is important and must be done; the way to achieve was plain idiotic. The movie brings Boyce as having a conscience crisis while getting the CIA cables about their intrusion in Australia, at the same time Nixon administration was being investigated with the Watergate scandal (to me, the movie falters a bit because we see Boyce supporting Nixon then it jumps to his decision to become a spy. We never get that moment when he says he felt betrayed by his Commander in Chief). All he had to do was to be a whistle blower, go to the media and spread the word. He had the great idea but failed to use it properly. In the times of Snowden, The Falcon... definitely deserves a good revisit so audiences can make comparisons about both cases, where lies the difference between risking everything while following a good ideal to a greater good or exceeding on an ideal that goes nowhere.The Falcon and the Snowman is carefully directed by John Schlesinger, a versatile director who managed to shift between genres and themes in such an easy way that sometimes you never notice he's the man behind the film. And it's so strange that all I could think, as I was re-watching this film, was of his greatest hit Midnight Cowboy. Again, a story about friendship between two polar opposites trying to survive a predatory world (something on Penn's affectuous and mannerisms clearly reminds us of Dustin Hoffman's Rizzo). Schlesinger is helped by the effective cinematography of Allen Daviau (my favorite shot is a conversation between Boyce and Alex at the Embassy, with the Russian man telling the American that their partnership is just beginning when Boyce wanted to get out. The camera goes right behind Suchet's head, eclipsing Hutton. A strange shot but very symbolic). And this marks as Steven Zaillian's first screenplay, and what a work! It's an intelligent script that allows the audience to think about it, even when all of the intricate plot seem to jump facts. The NSA inspection scene has to be one of the most tense sequences ever brought to the screen - along with all the scenes involving Sean Penn's descent to hell. Penn, in so many ways, steals the movie from Hutton (he was huge back then, bear in mind). It marks as Penn's first great serious effort (besides the prison movie), and the worst his character goes through, the more interesting he gets - only delivering one or two false acting notes. A near perfect screenplay (I'd cut the romance between Boyce and Lori Singer character). And there's David Bowie & Pat Metheny closing song! This Is Not America echoes in several directions. When Penn's character is detained, this is the exact quote a Mexican cop says to him. But it can also be interpreted as Boyce's way of thinking this is not the country he lived and at once admired.

Just watch the entire film and you'll see why it's flat out boring and lame. Unnecessary sequel. For me, that was a very wise move, Keanu! I would totally give him the props (bro fist) and five thumbs up, not for ditching Jan and Sandra but for criticizing the film's plot, setting and script. He knows what a horrible, shitty sequel is when he sees it. Even if Keanu returned as Jack, he would truly shine as Jack but that's not enough to save this movie. You're better off watching the first film. Great decision Keanu! You truly deserve a raise! Jason Patrick, although he does do his best to shine as Annie's new policeman fiancé, let's face it NOBODY, not even Jason can replace Keanu's role (no offence). Jack has just the right facial appearance and the right amount of mischief in his eyes to be a born heroic cop. He's the MAN! Although Sandra, Willem and director Jan try to prevent this already waterlogged sequel from sinking to the bottom of the ocean by inserting some twists and turns, a few action sequences and some laughable dialogue, the biggest flop of this sequel is the lack of thrill with a slow-moving cruise ship rather than a fast, wired-for-explosive-destruction bomb laden city bus zooming above 50 MPH through the streets of Los Angeles and ending up at the airport. Even when the ship crashes into a beach town of Saint Martin bringing it to a halt, look at how slow the ship is, even at full speed. It BARELY damaged the area. I mean, look at the substantial amount of deceleration in this film. It was slower and poorer, like a garbage truck or by watching paint dry. As soon as Kenau declined to reprise his role as Jack, Sandra (as Annie) should have followed. The director Jan could have done a better job at the plot line and setting like have Daniel Payne (Howard's son) avenge his father's death by rigging a huge C4 in the cargo area of a Boeing 737 that Jack, his wife Annie and their two sons are flying on vacation to Hawaii activate if it accelerates above 185 knots and ascends above 2300 feet (the captain or first officer gets injured leaving the other pilot to fly the plane with Jack and Annie assisting him. After ALL the hostages parachute to safety from the moving plane, the out of fuel Boeing 737 nosedives into the ground. Jack, Mac and Annie continue to defeat Daniel using a slightly different scam than from the first film. After Jack, Mac and Annie kill Daniel, they all head home into the sunset or eat pizza in a restaurant. That's more like what the plot should have been; on a fast moving vehicle, with Keanu and Sandra's characters married (they make such an adorable couple) and a few newcomer child actors for the two sons. This flopped sequel just killed the speed film franchise. I doubt there will ever be a Speed 3 (Keanu declined the possibility of a third film) and if there is and reunites Keanu and Sandy, I just hope they can still maintain their young looks from the '90s. Annie's character is significantly reduced here. Also, Glenn Plummer, Joe Morton and Sandra Bullock are the only ones to reprise. Jan should have abandoned the project for a sequel when Reeves quit.

Although Sandra, Willem and director Jan try to prevent this already waterlogged sequel from sinking to the bottom of the ocean by inserting some twists and turns, a few action sequences and some laughable dialogue, the biggest flop of this sequel is the lack of thrill with a slow-moving cruise ship rather than a fast, wired-for-explosive-destruction bomb laden city bus zooming above 50 MPH through the streets of Los Angeles and ending up at the airport. Even when the ship crashes into a beach town of Saint Martin bringing it to a halt, look at how slow the ship is, even at full speed. It BARELY damaged the area.

After ALL the hostages parachute to safety from the moving plane, the out of fuel Boeing 737 nosedives into the ground. Jack, Mac and Annie continue to defeat Daniel using a slightly different scam than from the first film. After Jack, Mac and Annie kill Daniel, they all head home into the sunset or eat pizza in a restaurant. That's more like what the plot should have been; on a fast moving vehicle, with Keanu and Sandra's characters married (they make such an adorable couple) and a few newcomer child actors for the two sons. This flopped sequel just killed the speed film franchise. I doubt there will ever be a Speed 3 (Keanu declined the possibility of a third film) and if there is and reunites Keanu and Sandy, I just hope they can still maintain their young looks from the '90s.

It's a delightful and enjoyable film, but it doesn't seem to add up to much. When you compare it to his extensive filmography it wouldn't even land in the top half of his best work because it's far from being memorable. He's directed so many movies that several of them feel incredibly familiar and for that reason they are easy to forget. He repeats several of the same themes throughout his movies and Mighty Aphrodite isn't the exception, especially putting a lot of emphasis on love and infidelity which are recurring themes in Allen's films. At times his films stand out for simply capturing these human emotions in a new way, and at others they do thanks to a particularly strong performance. In this case it was Mira Sorvino's supportive performance as Linda Ash that garnered all the attention playing a hooker who isn't all that right in the head. The way she delivered her lines with her high-pitched voice contributed to the overall comedy of her character. If there is one thing that I will remember from this forgettable Allen film it's her Oscar winning performance. Despite her solid performance this is still one of the weakest Woody Allen movies I've seen.In Mighty Aphrodite Woody Allen plays Lenny, a sportswriter, who is married to Amanda (Helena Bonham Carter). In order to spark some life into their monotonous relationship they decide to adopt a son who they name Max. After several years Lenny is surprised to discover that Max is such a brilliant kid and so he decides to search for his biological parents convinced that they must have great genes. He visits the adoption agency and is denied the files, but his curiosity gets the best of him and he finds a way to steal them. He tracks down the biological mother only to discover that she is a prostitute who is now going by the name of Linda Ash (Mira Sorvino). Lenny sets up an appointment with her and is disappointed that she ended up being so dumb. Concerned with her lifestyle, Lenny tries to help Linda by reforming her and setting her up with some respectable man. Meanwhile, Lenny and Amanda are going through some marital problems of their own. The narrative is linked with a bizarre Greek chorus (led by F. Murray Abraham) that compares Lenny's story with the Greek tragedy Oedipus.Allen always delivers some witty dialogues and funny situations in his films which make them such an entertaining ride. Mighty Aphrodite has a few moments like this that work well, but as a whole it is a very forgettable movie. Allen plays once again a sort of neurotic character who is fascinated with discovering who his adopted son's mother really is. Sorvino's performance is brilliant and elevates the material, but there isn't more to it. Neither Allen nor Bonham Carter seem to stand out and their relationship isn't central to the film. The Greek chorus was far from interesting and only took away from the story by trying to hard to compare the modern tale with the Greek one. It's a light and corny film that is saved by Sorvino's presence and Allen's distinctive style of humor. http\/\/estebueno10.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"22 September 2015","score":"","review":" Of all human weaknesses, obsession is the most dangerous, and the silliest!When you direct and write a film every year you can't expect to always deliver a masterpiece, and that is the case with Woody Allen's Mighty Aphrodite.

The plot is basically a group of astronauts go into hibernation in their spaceship traveling near the speed of light, until they wake up years later in an unknown planet, run by intelligent apes, which treat humans as inferior animals.I'll just start off by saying Charlton Heston is absolutely brilliant in the role, he steals every scene he's in. Watching this movie after over 45 years it came out I am pleasantly surprised to see the effects still look pretty good. I honestly have almost no complaints with Planet of the Apes, the acting is solid, the directing is pretty good and the costume design is amazing.The only minor complaints I have are the pacing may feel a bit slow at times, but that's it, and it really is minor.But story-wise, Planet of the Apes is brilliant. Now, I won't spoil anything in this review, but the widely known twist ending at the ending of the movie is one of the greatest twists in the history of cinema. As a first time viewer, not knowing anything about the movie, it's really necessary to allow that ending to sink in.Planet of the Apes is a landmark of science fiction cinema, not only a great movie, but an important one, a thought provoking masterpiece that raises important questions still relevant today. Are we headed in the right direction as a human race?

While on a science class field trip, Peter is bitten by a genetically- engineered super spider. As a result, Peter gains superhuman abilities, increased strength, speed and the abilities to scale walls and generate organic webbing.After his beloved Uncle Ben is murdered, a murder Peter could have easily prevented, the teenager realizes that he must use his newfound abilities to protect New York City and he becomes Spider-Man. Meanwhile, wealthy industrialist Norman Osborn, the father of Peter's best friend Harry Osborn, subjects himself to an experimental performance-enhancing serum, which creates a psychotic and murderous split personality. Donning a military battlesuit, Norman becomes the freakish Green Goblin, who begins to terrorize the city. Peter, as Spider-Man, now must do battle with the Goblin, all while trying to express his true feelings for Mary Jane.The feel of the comic book look and the film should be praised. Director Sam Raimi and his team really did a great job of bringing the Spider-Man character to life on the big screen was really amazing, and with today's CGI effects, they were about to make him jump and climb up walls.From the skyscrapers of New York to the warehouses to the film's web slinging sequences to the action sequences, this movie makes you feel like you wish you had the same powers as Spider-Man and the film has a great cast, who bring true performances to the characters they are playing.Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker and Spider-Man and who does an amazing job in the part and his performance won me over in this film and he would play the part for the next two films. When he is Peter Parker, he takes a serious approach, but once he is Spider-Man, man, he is super cool. The way that had his costume in this film was just wonderful, but the one thing that was missing was his web-shooters, but that was in the reboot.Willem Dafoe plays Norman Osborn and Green Goblin and he gives us a menacing, hilarious and serious villain who loves being evil and I will say, the costume is a bit stupid, but I like it though. It's not horrible, but it could have been worse, worse than George Clooney's Batman suit in Batman and Robin and that is for sure! The rest of the cast is just amazing. James Franco plays Harry Osborn and he does an amazing job. Rosemary Harris is sweet and was the perfect casting choice and he is just amazing and fantastic, as the grandmother and aunt of Peter Parker, Aunt May Parker and she does wonders.The late Cliff Robertson plays Uncle Ben and that was the best performance of his career. It was really amazing and fantastic to see him in that role, who would later be played by Martin Sheen, in the 2012 reboot.At last, but least, Kirsten Dunst plays the role of Mary Jane Watson and she gives an amazing performance in this film and her and Dunst won 2003 MTV Movie Award for Best Kiss and that kiss with them is one of my favorite moments in movies.The music by Danny Elfman is just amazing and fantastic. The theme is really amazing as hell and it is fantastic and so amazing. It was a really good musical score and I love his BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS musical scores and that was really fantastic.The visuals are amazing and the action sequences that I like the most are the fights between Spider-Man and Green Goblin and the fight choreography in those scenes were really well done and the dialogue in this movie is really wonderful and this script was written by David Koepp and he wrote a good script and this film is really amazing.Overall, SPIDER-MAN is a really amazing film and it is really fantastic and an amazing, spectacular, incredible, stunning and well done superhero film that does not get enough credit and it really gets a lot of things right and this was really fantastic and it is really amazing to see Spider-Man on the big screen.I could go for hours talking about how much I like this and talk about the action sequences, the dialogue, the effects, music, editing and the acting from the actors, but I know that IMDb has a word limit and I've got to keep this review short.Spider-Man is a really good and amazing comic book film and this will remain as one of my best superhero films of all time and one of my best superhero films on IMDb and it will not change. I'm giving this film a rating of an 8 out of 10.

And by big, I mean not only large in scope but usually insufferably long as well. That being said, it is not possible to give any of his films less than five stars because his visuals are always great and he was also a master of directing actors.DOCTOR ZHIVAGO, one of Lean's lesser efforts, is a lovely-to-look-at but interminably long (at three hours and seventeen minutes) story of a man cheating on his wife. A great deal of justification for the affair is written into the script (as it was in the novel), but at the end of the day, we have a man who to all intents and purposes loves his wife and children who suddenly finds his true love in another woman.After an opening frame scene in which Zhivago's brother Yevgraf (Alec Guinness) interviews a young girl (Rita Tushingham) whom he suspects might be his brother's love child with Lara (Julie Christie), the main story begins with the funeral of Yuri Zhivago's mother (Tarek Sharif played the eight-year-old Yuri); it is a lovely, austere, and painfully slow-moving scene that is a harbinger of things to come. After the poor woman is finally in the ground, the young orphan is taken to live with the Gromyko family. They have a young daughter about Yuri's age named Tonya, and to cut to the chase, when they grow up, Yuri and Tonya marry and start a family as he begins his career in medicine (and writing poetry on the side). The marriage is a happy one and Yuri genuinely loves his wife and children.Meanwhile we see Lara, a poor young woman helping her mother in her dress shop and engaged to a young radical named Pasha (Tom Courtenay). Lara's mother is having an affair with a wealthy businessman named Komarovsky (Rod Steiger), and before we know what's what he makes moves on Lara.To sum up the rest of the plot in a nutshell, a good deal happens before Lara and Yuri finally meet, but when they do they inexplicably fall madly in love and Lara ends up being the inspiration for a poem written by Yuri.The whole thing plays out against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution. I have noticed that movies about this period tend to be long and rather dull, with a lot of long sequences in which little more is seen than vast expanses of snow (REDS is another of these pictures).I am being too harsh, perhaps. This film has a lot of good things the acting is flawless, the script is a fair adaptation of Pasternak's book, and the story, when Lean allows it to move, is compelling stuff. Plus it is beautifully shot and graced with an achingly romantic score by Maurice Jarre. Unfortunately at the end of the day what we have is a rather sordid tale of a man cheating on his wife and the excuse for his betrayal is that he is a poet and a dreamer. And Lean takes more than three hours to tell this story.Lovely to look at, but the story is not the grand romance it is made out to be and the film itself is mostly a crashing bore.

And by big, I mean not only large in scope but usually insufferably long as well. That being said, it is not possible to give any of his films less than five stars because his visuals are always great and he was also a master of directing actors.DOCTOR ZHIVAGO, one of Lean's lesser efforts, is a lovely-to-look-at but interminably long (at three hours and seventeen minutes) story of a man cheating on his wife. A great deal of justification for the affair is written into the script (as it was in the novel), but at the end of the day, we have a man who to all intents and purposes loves his wife and children who suddenly finds his true love in another woman.After an opening frame scene in which Zhivago's brother Yevgraf (Alec Guinness) interviews a young girl (Rita Tushingham) whom he suspects might be his brother's love child with Lara (Julie Christie), the main story begins with the funeral of Yuri Zhivago's mother (Tarek Sharif played the eight-year-old Yuri); it is a lovely, austere, and painfully slow-moving scene that is a harbinger of things to come. After the poor woman is finally in the ground, the young orphan is taken to live with the Gromyko family. They have a young daughter about Yuri's age named Tonya, and to cut to the chase, when they grow up, Yuri and Tonya marry and start a family as he begins his career in medicine (and writing poetry on the side). The marriage is a happy one and Yuri genuinely loves his wife and children.Meanwhile we see Lara, a poor young woman helping her mother in her dress shop and engaged to a young radical named Pasha (Tom Courtenay). Lara's mother is having an affair with a wealthy businessman named Komarovsky (Rod Steiger), and before we know what's what he makes moves on Lara.To sum up the rest of the plot in a nutshell, a good deal happens before Lara and Yuri finally meet, but when they do they inexplicably fall madly in love and Lara ends up being the inspiration for a poem written by Yuri.The whole thing plays out against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution. I have noticed that movies about this period tend to be long and rather dull, with a lot of long sequences in which little more is seen than vast expanses of snow (REDS is another of these pictures).I am being too harsh, perhaps. This film has a lot of good things the acting is flawless, the script is a fair adaptation of Pasternak's book, and the story, when Lean allows it to move, is compelling stuff. Plus it is beautifully shot and graced with an achingly romantic score by Maurice Jarre. Unfortunately at the end of the day what we have is a rather sordid tale of a man cheating on his wife and the excuse for his betrayal is that he is a poet and a dreamer. And Lean takes more than three hours to tell this story.Lovely to look at, but the story is not the grand romance it is made out to be and the film itself is mostly a crashing bore. But this is a highly subjective review; many people loved this film and a lot of folks hated it.
