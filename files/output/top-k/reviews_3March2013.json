But in the end he is unable to get the support he needs from the Scottish nobility and his revolt falls apart. Wallace is hung drawn and quartered after his capture but, of course, the idea of freedom lives on.Gibson is very good in the part and plays with utter conviction. My only reservation here was that he leaves his highland village aged about ten and returns aged forty although you would expect him to be in his twenties. He remains looking forty for the remaining years of his life too. But it is difficult to get around the fact that in showing someone's life you have to use different actors &#x96; if you have too many it gets confusing. I'm no expert but his accent sounds pretty good to me too.The casting is convincing throughout especially with the grizzled and weathered warriors who always mange to look as they really know how to handle themselves. Special mention must go to Patrick McGoohan who is perfect as Edward Longshanks. The cold and calculating way in which he manipulates everyone around him is played to the maximum and you believe that this man could really dominate his family and his court through sheer force of will.Gibson also directs and it is difficult to find fault in this. The battle scenes are some of the best ever seen on screen though I do not know how much of this is down to the second unit direction rather than Gibson. Whatever, it is impressive.As a viewing experience I do feel the third act is a little disappointing as the rebel camp falls apart and Wallace is betrayed and captured and this section could have been trimmed down a little. But that's just a minor point. Some people have noticed historical inaccuracies and moaned about them. For instance Prince Edward's French wife was apparently only about six years old at the time she is portrayed as an adult having it off with Mel in the film.

A couple of important points First, I have seen a few reviews of the film complaining about the fire scene. Spoilers ahead That scene is brilliant and necessary because Paul Sutton (Keanu Reeves) showed Alberto Aragon (Giancarlo Giannini), that he has what it takes to follow in his footsteps to not only run the winery, but to make it even better (Which is what the last scene in the film shows). The fire essentially was a cleansing agent, erasing most of the old and bringing in the new. Don Pedro (Anthony Quinn (Who did the best acting job in the film)), knew that Paul had what it takes to run things which is why he said to Paul I have faith in you and my son. This point is critical because he knew Pedro Jr (Freddy Rodriguez), had no interest in running the business, thus, only Paul had what it took to keep the business going after Alberto passed on ( Alberto knew a way of life was ending, and finally admitted to Victoria he was  afraid of losing you and everything). I also look at the scene, where Don Pedro talked to Paul and then he looked and found the root of the family tress and he lifted the roots out of the ground which reminded me of King Arthur and  Excalibur. Basically it was his destiny to save the vineyards, and one day take over for Alberto. So that the end, Alberto realizes what kind of man Paul is, and that indeed Don Pedro is correct, and Paul is not only up to the job, for one day taking over the vineyards, and caring for Victoria, but it is his destiny to do so. Which is why he said to Paul This is your family, and these are your roots. Paul honestly does not know what to do, but Alberto tells Victoria (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon (Who is a knockout to say the least)), to Go to your husband. I have also seen critics complain about Paul leaving his wife Betty (Debra Sutton), for Victoria. If I came back from the War, and saw my wife in bed with another man, I would not want anything to do with her either. One more point about Paul he was perfect for Victoria, because of the way he carried himself He was tortured by what happened to him in the war, then walks in his home to see what Betty did (And walks away, instead of hitting him, her, or both), yet was willing to help a total stranger (Victoria) who is terrified of her father, when they met on a bus. He finally learned to not only love Victoria, but the entire Aragon way of life, and essentially embraced being an Aragon. Which is a life far better than the world he came from (Including being raised in an orphanage, and coming back from World War II). It is interesting that it is something Pedro Jr and to a lesser extent, Victoria did not want. Next the scenery is incredible.

There are so many themes in this film it is not funny Love, honor, responsibility, decency, acceptance, change & renewal to name a few. Do I love this movie?

On the other hand I can reliably tell you that Cruel Intentions is not very good.Because the film has been out for so long I have read comments on SMG's performance that range from praising her abilities through to saying she is out of her depth completely. I think she tries hard but she has no chance of succeeding with this material. Ryan Philippe also tries hard and is more successful.

It is always difficult to divorce actors from long-running TV roles but this story really cries out for the Buffy treatment and I just wish Joss Whedon had been given the job of writing it. (As an aside I recently watched Alien Resurrection again and came to the conclusion that one of its biggest problems was that Whedon couldn't write so effectively for older actors).The overall problem is simply that you never believe in any of these characters or their actions and motivations. I believe that it would be perfectly possible to make this film work with better dialogue. Shame. Still it is still worth watching for SMG and Selma Blair.

For that reason I have never seen Dangerous Liaisons. Also I hate John Malkovitch, I can't tell you why it's just one of those things. Anyway I do like Sarah Michelle Gellar, in an avuncular and wholly healthy manner of course, and so I had to watch this film on DVD. It is, as you know, an updating of aforementioned D Liaisons. For all I know D Liaisons was a very good film and indeed my wife tells me that it was though I don't know if she can be trusted in the matter of frock film criticism. On the other hand I can reliably tell you that Cruel Intentions is not very good.Because the film has been out for so long I have read comments on SMG's performance that range from praising her abilities through to saying she is out of her depth completely. I think she tries hard but she has no chance of succeeding with this material. Ryan Philippe also tries hard and is more successful. I actually found his character almost believable and he clearly has a great future. Reese Whitherspoon did absolutely nothing for me and I think she was miscast. Selma Blair was completely outstanding and I can feel that familiar avuncular tenderness creeping up on me again as I think of her.To the material. This has to be one of the most appallingly written scripts I have come across in a long time. It was stilted and contrived and whilst older actors might just have got away with it, the dialogue was completely wrong for this set of young and very talented actors. If you modernise the setting then I believe you have to modernise the dialogue or at the very least give it enough idiomatic spin to sound right for the characters.

I've had the score and song memorized since and, of course, I knew the outcome.Well, when the movie opened, I felt more than ready. Gone were the thoughts Be prepared, this is three plus hours and I was once again mesmerized from minute one all the way until minute 194. This near-masterpiece made me miss how movies are supposed to made with heart and talent. And that year, plenty were some of other best picture nominations, L.A. Confidential, Good Will Hunting, and As Good as it Gets, were also utterly fantastic. Sadly, since 1997, we're lucky to have ONE made with such heart and incredible talent per year.By now, everyone knows the story and has since copied it multiple times. Let me make this clear VERY few have made one with such a great script with believable dialogue, excellent actors and above all-else, chemistry. Kate and Leo had it in spades. From the second Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) looked up when new-friend, Tommy (Jason Barry) was talking to him, and saw Rose (Kate Winslet,) I KNEW they captured true love.Since this movie arrived 15 years ago, I've been a pretty good fan of Kate, but not so much Leo. He suffers from Denzelitis whereas almost every role he performs, he's not trying to act; he's JUST trying to win an Oscar. This annoying habit leads to way too much over-acting and an abundance of screaming. (SEE practically any Leo or Denzel Washington role since 1997.)But...Leo pulled it off here. Truly, he showed such a deep affection, love and purity towards his costar that I believed every word, every action and that Rose's heart will go on. He did it so well, with each viewing, I always envisioned her life, the rest of it from the Titanic sinking until her death with him in her heart.These two, Rose and Jack amongst a few other decent characters, namely the fantastic Kathy Bates as The Unsinkable Molly Brown, were so good and deep that I never mind that it's about an hour and a half or more before the special effects kick in. I.E. The ship sinks. (Oops, sorry, spoiler.)That's the genius of James Cameron. His heart and soul was in this project. He nearly bankrupted the studio and himself and practically gave himself a bad name prior to opening &#x96; which was rescheduled more than once. He didn't just make an hour and half retelling of a sinking ship, even though he had the technology. And he didn't just put two romantic leads together; he made sure that the fictional love backdrop was as real as the amazing sinkage.To give an example of an epic retelling following Titanic that did not have the qualities needed to further an opening buildup of a romance is Peter Jackson's King Kong. It was flat, boring and unconvincing. He sure had the talent &#x96; Kong looked real, but sadly that CGI character held the most depth in the movie.Beyond the romance &#x96; that, yes, made me tear again after all these years\/viewings and only because I believed the true love before me, was the ultimate score, one of the best songs, movie hit or not, excellent dialogue spoken &#x96; mostly by Leo and Molly Brown, great special effects and breathtaking cinematography. I had to see this on the big screen again, although I would've MOST preferred to have the option of 2-D.I would love to see a new movie of such deep quality and soul like this spend a deserved 15-weeks at number one at the box office that I would strongly stand behind. Recently, The Hunger Games did a decent four weeks at number one, and the highly inferior to both movies, Avatar, did seven. But both were just simple blockbusters. Not heart-felt movies. Not movies I would rate 5\/5 stars &#x96; my highest honor of reviews.Sadly, James Cameron's follow-up, the Space Gully with Wolves film, Avatar, brought down Titanic's mind-blowing record box-office receipts. Oh, how I wished with the 2012 re-release with the ho-hum 3-D format would've have reclaimed the top spot. But it isn't to happen. And that's okay. It's still a great movie, still holds up today, still makes me laugh and cry and still makes me feel love all over again for movie making. If you are one of the six people in the world that hasn't seen it, SEE TITANIC.Side Note Way back in the day, when internet was really just kick starting and we had things like I.M.'ing each other, I was involved in a long-distance relationship and I actually typed out Céline Dion's song, My Heart Will Go On to my partner that thoroughly made him blush.Side Note II As stated, I watched this three times in the theatre following its initial release. On the last turn, I was on a first date with a guy &#x96; against all warnings from my friends to make Titanic a first date movie. Well, it did turn out to be the first and last date. This was his first viewing of Titanic and still, he fell asleep around hour one and awoke right before (spoiler!) Jack dies. I know my date was awoken because his snores stopped and he instantly began weeping. Frustrated, I said in a normal voice, despite being in the theatre, What do you have to be crying about? You don't even know these characters! Yep, that was the last I saw of him.

I hadn't actually been sure as of late. For, I've seen it three times in the theatres back in 97\/98 and maybe once more on VHS a year or two later. I've had the score and song memorized since and, of course, I knew the outcome.Well, when the movie opened, I felt more than ready. Gone were the thoughts Be prepared, this is three plus hours and I was once again mesmerized from minute one all the way until minute 194. This near-masterpiece made me miss how movies are supposed to made with heart and talent. And that year, plenty were some of other best picture nominations, L.A. Confidential, Good Will Hunting, and As Good as it Gets, were also utterly fantastic. Sadly, since 1997, we're lucky to have ONE made with such heart and incredible talent per year.By now, everyone knows the story and has since copied it multiple times. Let me make this clear VERY few have made one with such a great script with believable dialogue, excellent actors and above all-else, chemistry. Kate and Leo had it in spades. From the second Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) looked up when new-friend, Tommy (Jason Barry) was talking to him, and saw Rose (Kate Winslet,) I KNEW they captured true love.Since this movie arrived 15 years ago, I've been a pretty good fan of Kate, but not so much Leo. He suffers from Denzelitis whereas almost every role he performs, he's not trying to act; he's JUST trying to win an Oscar. This annoying habit leads to way too much over-acting and an abundance of screaming. (SEE practically any Leo or Denzel Washington role since 1997.)But...Leo pulled it off here. Truly, he showed such a deep affection, love and purity towards his costar that I believed every word, every action and that Rose's heart will go on. He did it so well, with each viewing, I always envisioned her life, the rest of it from the Titanic sinking until her death with him in her heart.These two, Rose and Jack amongst a few other decent characters, namely the fantastic Kathy Bates as The Unsinkable Molly Brown, were so good and deep that I never mind that it's about an hour and a half or more before the special effects kick in. I.E. The ship sinks. (Oops, sorry, spoiler.)That's the genius of James Cameron. His heart and soul was in this project. He nearly bankrupted the studio and himself and practically gave himself a bad name prior to opening &#x96; which was rescheduled more than once. He didn't just make an hour and half retelling of a sinking ship, even though he had the technology. And he didn't just put two romantic leads together; he made sure that the fictional love backdrop was as real as the amazing sinkage.To give an example of an epic retelling following Titanic that did not have the qualities needed to further an opening buildup of a romance is Peter Jackson's King Kong. It was flat, boring and unconvincing. He sure had the talent &#x96; Kong looked real, but sadly that CGI character held the most depth in the movie.Beyond the romance &#x96; that, yes, made me tear again after all these years\/viewings and only because I believed the true love before me, was the ultimate score, one of the best songs, movie hit or not, excellent dialogue spoken &#x96; mostly by Leo and Molly Brown, great special effects and breathtaking cinematography.

I'm guilty on all charges.I knew this film was going to kick ass as soon as I heard the magisterial tone of Charlton Heston's voice-over at the beginning. When this was closely followed by a space shuttle being blown apart by asteroids and the destruction of large parts of an American city I was a very happy man. Even though I liked Deep Impact, this film is better &#x96; it destroys more things, more effectively in the first 10 minutes and thereafter grabs you by the throat and never lets go until the end credits.I will freely admit that one reason this film grabs my attention so much is the extensive use of the space shuttles and the excellent NASA footage and locations. It really gives an impression of what the shuttle is like, what a launch is like, how dangerous it is. Certainly liberties are taken and things speeded up such as a docking with Mir that happens so fast that in reality it would knock the station into an orbit with Saturn. There is also the slight matter of how a shuttle survives hitting several gazillion-ton asteroids but can have a whole wall blown out by a few bullets.Oh yes, the plot. Asteroid heading for Earth. Bruce Willis drills big holes for his oil company. US govt. hires Willis to dig hole and plant nuke on said asteroid. Willis recruits dirty dozen type misfits for mission. NASA training. Paranoid military types. BOOM. BANG. Backwards clocks. Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler provide lurve interest.The script shows signs of being written by committee and some of the one-liners fall flat. When I introduce the law to ban trailers I will also introduce a 50 year moratorium on speeches from American presidents who say they are doing something in co-operation with the whole world whilst in reality they use one comedy Russian in the whole thing and accidentally blow up Mir in the process.

What it does do is catch some spirit of the restless sixties and in the process start up a new, if short-lived, style in filmmaking. Actually, the background notes suggest the results amount more to a happy accident than to anything planned. What Hopper-Fonda got was a first-rate cinematographer (Kovacs); a mostly improvised script; a couple of probing remarks; a blissed-out Jack Nicholson; and a lot of fresh looks at roadside America.Also, the three main characters are wisely conceived. Fonda's Wyatt is quiet but with good instincts. It's like he's experienced much more than he can articulate, so he lives mainly inside himself. Hopper's Billy amounts to a warning against too much dope. He's just drifting along to nowhere on a stream of hippie slang. Nicholson's Hanson is an establishment dropout via the whiskey bottle, who finds kinship with the two drifters. More importantly, he's also the only one who understands the bigger cultural picture. Together, they're a trio far from the usual Hollywood clichés. Importantly, no one of the three is particularly likable, and I suspect a lot of folks dislike the movie because of that.To me, at least, the movie manages two profound moments. But otherwise, its appeal remains that of catching the restless, even rebellious, spirit of the 1960's. Oddly however, there's not a single reference to the driving force behind the counter-cultural movement, namely, opposition to the unpopular war in Vietnam. Thus, opposition to conventional norms appears more a matter of drugs, long hair, and non-commitment sex than anything larger, such as the country's political or economic conditions. However, for younger viewers, it's important to point out that the so-called counter-culture that Wyatt and Billy represent pretty much collapsed once our war in Vietnam ended.Two points in the movie, however, are worth noting. I really like Hanson's remarks on how too much of America celebrates individual freedom at the same time they punish its expression, as happens in the movie. That's a good point and one not restricted to dim-witted rednecks. In short, convention extols freedom at the same time it practices conformity, sometimes to the point of violence. The other remark is Wyatt's rather arcane, We blew it. Because it's left unexplained, the meaning's been pondered over the years. My guess is that Wyatt understands at a deeper level than he can articulate that their life of drifting along with drug deals and dope is ultimately purposeless. They haven't really engaged with the commune or Hanson's murder or even with life in general. Instead, they're simply skimming along, seeing the sights, but nothing beyond the passing parade. In short, the drug-deal money has ultimately done them no good at all. I expect both this probing remark and Hanson's came from professional writer Southern and not Hopper or Fonda.The movie holds up pretty well as a visual experience. That plus the cultural point about individual freedom endure. Otherwise, much of what was so topical at the time has faded. Nonetheless, Hopper did indeed get the role he was born to play, while Fonda manages to convey the necessary inner groping, whether intentional or not. Nicholson, of course, gets the showy part, which he does well enough. But, for me, a little of his toothy exuberance goes a long way. Anyway, the movie spawned a number of imitators, but remains the best of its type, well worth catching up with since the overall message has not faded with time.

I know that mostly everyone has forgotten this spiritless and pointless failure of a movie that was obviously intended to leave bad impression of H.G. Wells with everyone who never actually read his books. However, I just have to highlight even more stupidities and inconsistencies that this flick is essentially made of. Hopefully, I will not re-hash too much of what so many other reviewers already mentioned. Just to be fair, I want to bring up the only TWO positive points of this movie - the actual Time Machine prop that actually resembled the original concept (as far as its description goes in the original text) and made a solid steam-punkish impression of the Edwardian-era futuristic technology AND the Sienna Guillory's appearance. Despite of not being allowed to do much, she does a great job playing a romantic, cute but serious lady who just keeps popping up in all the wrong places at the worst possible time. Now, to the not-yet-mentioned-flops as I perceive them. 1) Why this movie is called THE Time Machine? Does it imply that this is THE most definitive, most all-encompassing story that beats the original book without even following 99% of the author's story line? 2) We are lead to believe that Alexander's short chat with the steam-powered vehicle driver allows him to learn the way to build a better steam power source. So, upon being called to do so, Alexander builds his totally self-sufficient time-traveling apparatus that evidently uses the power of steam (recall all the steam pressure gauges that machine proudly displays) to provide sufficient energy for a limitless number of time jumps in all possible directions. I mean, since no actual time machine exists yet, it is pointless to argue what it can be powered by or how much of what kind of power is necessary, etc. Although the Back to The Future's time machine that required a carefully balanced mix of high speed motion and influx of great number of Gigawatts of electricity made a more convincing (though somewhat humorous) impression of a time-traveling apparatus. In the H.G. Wells's original novel there was no specific mentioning of the power source employed by the time machine. One just knew that it was not horse-powered and the power source was actually self-contained. 3) What made the script writers think that back in the late 19th century NYC a public place filled with respectable public would be favored by armed robbers? Come on! There was more than enough social segregation in existence during those days that made it practically impossible for a low-life lower class armed robber to even appear in the midst of respectable and well-to-do public. I can hardly imagine anyone insane and lucky enough to be willing or able to carry out a time-stretched armed robbery resulting in shooting a robbery victim to death. Keep in mind that a large caliber revolving pistol produces TONS of noise and police used to patrol such public places ON FOOT (not locked up in cars staring at computer terminal screens like they do it today) at a distance of being able to hear a police whistle produced by a nearby patrol (cops had no portable radios then). 4) Now, the idea of the Moon falling apart from some nuclear mining operation is ridiculous (although beautifully depicted) considering what our next-door space neighbor went through already with them giant meteorite impacts and stuff. 5) WHY the Eloi were turned into some sort of a mixed African\/South American tribe living in hanging flower pots is waaay beyond my understanding. No one can possibly believe that such obviously physically capable and inventive group of people would fail to defend itself from some ape-like primitively armed and armorless Morlocks. Obviously, the directors wanted to include some strong but oppressed people of color to the movie, but did not know how and why to do it. 6) Why was the Uber-Morlock character added to the movie? What insight did he provide? If he was such incredibly powerful mind-controller, then why did he resort to a primitive knife fighting and chocking? That was just ridiculous. 7) What happened to the planet in the far-far away future? We just see a bunch of the Morlock-built scary structures all over the place. Which means that they did not eat all the Eloi at once after all or they got scared of messing with Eloi and started eating one another instead? 8) What made Alexander abandon time travel without clearly learning the reasons why the past cannot be changed? Being a true scientist, would he just drop all his research like this? If one is to speculate about this topic of changing the past, the assuming that the past that already happened cannot be changed, then traveling into in would be impossible in the first place. Or an attempt to change the past would result in a fork in the time line thus creating an alternate reality. But the movie does not bother to bring up any of these theories. 9) What made it possible for the NYPL to nicely survive all the disasters, land changes, ice ages and who knows what else that presumable took place in 800,000-odd years? Even the shelves storing PAPER BOOKS were left practically intact. The books themselves stayed there unmoved! Why? The library was not hidden deep underground and filled with inert gas or something! There would have been absolutely no trace of any library left whatsoever. &#x85;And so on and so forth. In short, you should really just read the book first and foremost.

Or an attempt to change the past would result in a fork in the time line thus creating an alternate reality. But the movie does not bother to bring up any of these theories. 9) What made it possible for the NYPL to nicely survive all the disasters, land changes, ice ages and who knows what else that presumable took place in 800,000-odd years? Even the shelves storing PAPER BOOKS were left practically intact. The books themselves stayed there unmoved! Why? The library was not hidden deep underground and filled with inert gas or something! There would have been absolutely no trace of any library left whatsoever. &#x85;And so on and so forth. In short, you should really just read the book first and foremost.

Problem is, it isn't about this at all it's about fully grown men falling over on the snow and ice and hurting themselves; it's about someone as well built as Arnold Schwarzenegger looking silly whilst doing silly things for silly causes. It's a film feeding off the transgressive qualities someone like Schwarzenegger has and the comedic carnage than can ensue when the two binaries inherent with his body and the scenario are meshed together. If the film thinks it has any sort of message at all, then it has such little confidence in its ability to convey that message that it requires one of its characters to, quite literally, shout as loudly as they can the required exposition at the precise moment hosts of screen writing seminars will tell you the setup has ended and the actual meat of it is about to begin.The film actually begins with a production within the production, a mock-action movie set up akin to a Power Rangers episode whereby heroes and villains duel to the end and the heroes triumph. It's all very self-aware, save the day stuff as cheesy bad guys are vanquished and good wins, but it resonates in a way that I don't think the makers were perhaps anticipating when the finale of Jingle All the Way itself arrives so as to descend precisely into the very things sent up here.

At his place of work is the Christmas party, but he chooses to plough on with business suggesting enthusiasm as well as his tendency to shun integration with those he sees every day. Disaster strikes when he stays too long at the office and is bogged down in motorway traffic, thus missing Jaime's karate graduation and has it outlined to him BY his son that on top of everything he's cocked up in the past, this is the final straw. It is amusing to watch the kid sit there, in a bedroom decked out in all this fantastic stuff with toys everywhere, reiterating this to his father through an almighty sulk. He's got everything, but wants more.Hark, for Howard's opportunity at redemption arrives in the form of being able to provide Jaime with a Turbo Man doll on Christmas morning &#x96; only, he forgot to buy it the months ago when he should have. Thus, the gauntlet has been laid down and now begins a mad dash around the stores for an edition of it. There is additionally some unpleasant ambiguity involving the Langston's next door neighbour, Ted (Hartman), who is practically everything Howard isn't, and whether Howard is actually out to get the toy for the sake of saving the bond with his son or just to get back at Ted whose already got the toy for HIS kids. It's established Ted has a bit of a way with women, but middle aged widower has eyes only for Howard's wife and with her as angry at Howard as Jaime is, there is a sense that he is at risk of losing her on top of his son's love. The film gets to unleash its funnier content when the two of them are at loggerheads with one another. There exists a sort of unspoken hatred between Howard and Ted; a happy, smiling exterior as they live next door to one another in a pleasant street that gives way to a mean, spiteful rivalry often feeding off the fact Ted is fond of Howard's wife and is domestically superior.The film is mostly just annoying, the set pieces might as well unfold in any order; there are worse things upon which to rely on driving your comedy than farce and slapstick, but the majority of it fails.

","genre":"Comedy, Family"},{"date":"3 March 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" POSSIBLE SPOILERSI think many people miss the whole point of this film, or at least the intent of the central character. Was George (Monty) an evil murderer? The answer is no; he was a normal male. He was faced with a choice--marry a pregnant Shelly Winters or marry a 19-year-old Elizabeth Taylor...hmmmm. We know that just before the accident (yes accident!) he reluctantly accepts the former. Now as far as being a murderer, did he commit murder? NO, he didn't! He was convicted because the jury believed the prosecution's (Raymond Burr's) conjecture that he slammed Alice (Shelly) on the head with the paddle. However we see exactly what happened; it was an accident a la Chappaquiddick--an accident--one he tried to cover up yes-but 1st degree murder?The main issue I have with this film is how he could have been attracted to Alice (Shelly) in the first place? I mean it's believable to be attracted to Liz, but Shirley? We know now Monty's orientation, but even so his scenes with Liz I think were believable, and with Shirley, not. And at he end his acceptance of his fate and guilt, which the priest prompts him to do, was a cop out ending I believe, because it was like he deserved the chair, when it's obvious to me he didn't--- jail time for trying to cover up the accident, maybe. SPOILERS AHEAD---I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, you're overlooking the fact that George plotted the murder at least in his mind and began to act on it. Yes, true to a certain extent. It's not, or at least should not, be illegal to contemplate anything. But exactly what did he do to act on it? He pretended to run out of gas, rented a boat (it's not his fault they didn't have life vests--the boat renter is responsible for that), and then after realizing he could NOT act on this half-baked notion, the accident occurred.

We know that just before the accident (yes accident!) he reluctantly accepts the former. Now as far as being a murderer, did he commit murder? NO, he didn't! He was convicted because the jury believed the prosecution's (Raymond Burr's) conjecture that he slammed Alice (Shelly) on the head with the paddle. However we see exactly what happened; it was an accident a la Chappaquiddick--an accident--one he tried to cover up yes-but 1st degree murder?The main issue I have with this film is how he could have been attracted to Alice (Shelly) in the first place? I mean it's believable to be attracted to Liz, but Shirley? We know now Monty's orientation, but even so his scenes with Liz I think were believable, and with Shirley, not. And at he end his acceptance of his fate and guilt, which the priest prompts him to do, was a cop out ending I believe, because it was like he deserved the chair, when it's obvious to me he didn't--- jail time for trying to cover up the accident, maybe.

It's not, or at least should not, be illegal to contemplate anything. But exactly what did he do to act on it? He pretended to run out of gas, rented a boat (it's not his fault they didn't have life vests--the boat renter is responsible for that), and then after realizing he could NOT act on this half-baked notion, the accident occurred.

This may seem odd for a lizard with an interest in serial murderers but I am very choosy about the killers I choose to study and the way they are presented, whether they are fictional or not. For instance I have totally lost interest in Thomas Harris and Hannibal Lector. Harris was a wonderful author and Manhunter was a wonderful film. Harris continued to be a brilliant author with Silence of the Lambs but this was ruined forever, as far as I am concerned, by Anthony Hopkins hammy interpretation. I suppose Jonathan Demme has to take a lot of the blame even though I admire some of his other films. But Lambs killed Lector for me and I can't be arsed to read Hannibal even though I bought it almost on the day of publication. I think only Michael Mann directing and Brian Cox as Lector could restore my faith in this franchise.The selective clips of American Psycho shown on TV and the interest of my family and friends in serial killers persuaded me to go to the multiplex. You should know right away that the film is very true to the book i.e. it is nihilistic, narcissistic and several other things beginning with n. All right-minded people and reptilians will hate it. I can confirm this because I saw it with Warrior Mouse, Princess Lizardess and a famous musician and film-score composer (no, really) who shall remain nameless. (But lets just call him Monarch of the Glen for now shall we?) To a man, woman, mouse and lizard we all thought it to be utterly tedious, boring and a complete waste of celluloid. In summary there is one joke, repeated several times, which is mildly amusing and at the expense of Phil Collins and other godawful 80s singers, an admittedly excellent performance by Christian Bale, given the pointlessness of the whole exercise, and long minutes of tedium.It was nagging away at me for some time what this film reminded me of. Then it came to me. It was obvious. American Psycho is the big budget version of The Blair Witch Project. Think about it. Both films are full of characters that are so hateful you wish they would get chopped to pieces by the psycho killer after spending five minutes with them. After 90 minutes in their presence you are prepared to wield the chainsaw yourself in order to end the torture of watching them. Both films have been hyped by their publicists and failed literary critics (i.e. film critics) as being masterpieces even though my cats have a better understanding of what makes a good film. Both films last for around 95 minutes and both films feel as though they last for 95 hours whilst you live through them. Both films feature characters who are afraid of things that normal citizens don't give a second thought to; in the case of Blair Witch, a fear of twigs, in the case of American Psycho, a fear of naff business cards or failure to get bookings at snotty restaurants that only women who want to become stick insects so they can star in more crap Hollywood products would want to eat in anyway. None of the characters in either film can tell the difference between fantasy and reality; no audience member of either film cares.
