It is, however, no less influential than any of the acclaimed and widely loved films that Hitch made previously. Even the staunchest of Hitchcock's fans seem to be bitterly divided over this one though, some among them simply not being able to forgive him for being so direct and blatant in choice and treatment of his subject matter (let alone technical inadequacies) - and for delivering a slow, sombre, pain ridden and malignant psychosexual drama, whereas others, myself included, revel in those very aspects of the film. Hedren and Connery's singular coupling on screen and their performances have also been subject to much heated debate - in my opinion they're both excellent, in that they very successfully portray genuinely unlovable characters and play off one another almost instinctively and to great effect, helped by a phenomenally sarcastic dialogue and more than memorable quips (The idea was to kill myself, not to feed the damned fish, as well as the entire You Freud, me Jane sequence). Delightful.Hedren is adequately surly, bitter, spiteful, troubled and fragile all at the same time, her average acting talents and icy beauty working for the film rather than against it, whereas Connery is nothing short of a perverse yet suave male filthy pig dying to get in between her treasured legs and take legal possession for precisely those reasons. Unsurprisingly, the chapter in acclaimed Truffaut's book of interviews with Hitch that belongs to Marnie is subtitled Un Amour Fetishiste - read it. It's interesting that Hitchcock had troubles with his leading ladies in some of his best films - his disdain of Kim Novak and endless arguments he had with her on set are all well documented, in addition to his falling out with Hedren halfway through Marnie. Both films are laced with moments of electrifying energy maybe just for that reason, and both women look spectacular on screen. In any case, it's perfect casting for both leads in this one, in addition to a brilliant support led by Latham and Baker, not to mention Herrmann's emotional score, which so assuredly bounces between hysterical, pleading, lustful, torturous, and tragic - and back again.Aside from directorial touches of genius (who doesn't get goosebumps when Marnie first reveals her face after washing out the hair dye) - there are undoubtedly many, many flaws and technically weak places in the film - the zooming in and out on the money in the Rutland safe is a particular standout in that respect, totally over the top and downright silly. Obviously painted backdrops and horseriding sequences have all been slagged off to death as well (altough surprisingly these don't seem to bother people that much when systematically applied in The Birds), but they are more than compensated for by the greyish, autumnal and trance-like feel of the film, and are very likely deliberately calculated in to greatly enhance the overall atmosphere.

It is, however, no less influential than any of the acclaimed and widely loved films that Hitch made previously. Even the staunchest of Hitchcock's fans seem to be bitterly divided over this one though, some among them simply not being able to forgive him for being so direct and blatant in choice and treatment of his subject matter (let alone technical inadequacies) - and for delivering a slow, sombre, pain ridden and malignant psychosexual drama, whereas others, myself included, revel in those very aspects of the film. Hedren and Connery's singular coupling on screen and their performances have also been subject to much heated debate - in my opinion they're both excellent, in that they very successfully portray genuinely unlovable characters and play off one another almost instinctively and to great effect, helped by a phenomenally sarcastic dialogue and more than memorable quips (The idea was to kill myself, not to feed the damned fish, as well as the entire You Freud, me Jane sequence). Delightful.Hedren is adequately surly, bitter, spiteful, troubled and fragile all at the same time, her average acting talents and icy beauty working for the film rather than against it, whereas Connery is nothing short of a perverse yet suave male filthy pig dying to get in between her treasured legs and take legal possession for precisely those reasons. Unsurprisingly, the chapter in acclaimed Truffaut's book of interviews with Hitch that belongs to Marnie is subtitled Un Amour Fetishiste - read it. It's interesting that Hitchcock had troubles with his leading ladies in some of his best films - his disdain of Kim Novak and endless arguments he had with her on set are all well documented, in addition to his falling out with Hedren halfway through Marnie. Both films are laced with moments of electrifying energy maybe just for that reason, and both women look spectacular on screen. In any case, it's perfect casting for both leads in this one, in addition to a brilliant support led by Latham and Baker, not to mention Herrmann's emotional score, which so assuredly bounces between hysterical, pleading, lustful, torturous, and tragic - and back again.Aside from directorial touches of genius (who doesn't get goosebumps when Marnie first reveals her face after washing out the hair dye) - there are undoubtedly many, many flaws and technically weak places in the film - the zooming in and out on the money in the Rutland safe is a particular standout in that respect, totally over the top and downright silly. Obviously painted backdrops and horseriding sequences have all been slagged off to death as well (altough surprisingly these don't seem to bother people that much when systematically applied in The Birds), but they are more than compensated for by the greyish, autumnal and trance-like feel of the film, and are very likely deliberately calculated in to greatly enhance the overall atmosphere.

In The Gods Must be Crazy, the movie depicts the bush people as uncivilized, hunters and gatherers, but as very friendly people. The movie does a very good job of showing the wide differences between the !Kung and the other natives, along with the white settlers. The main character of the !Kung is Xixo, who is able to help the white man to save the school children. In fact, Xixo is a main character in the movie, which is a rarity in African cinema. In addition, he helps Steyn, a white man who works with the testing of the game in the area, to save Ms. Thompson, the schoolteacher. The sole fact that a hunter and gatherer is able to be a sub-main character in the movie is quite an achievement to the African cinema. Furthermore, this gives the Africans something to be proud of when watching a movie about them. One issue in the movie I did not like was how the white man was displayed in nation geographic way. For example, how the city scene was showed in the movie. What I mean is that the narrator uses his voice to explain what is going on.

Another thing the director could have done was added subtitles to the African language to help the audience know what they are saying. However, the narrator does a good job in depicting what is said.

Look at the name of the movie. If you have any concept, or belief, in 'signs', karma, kismit, coincidences - or whatever terminology works for you - then you'll overlook the inconsistencies and appreciate the movie for what it was meant to be. This is, quite simply, a movie that tries to offer an alternative view of what so many people think of as simply random occurrences, a lucky break, divine intervention, or as I said earlier, coincidences - all those 'little things' in life that when they happen, seem to happen for no reason.. until all the pieces of the jigsaw come together in that one moment, and everything you THOUGHT was just a coincidence is explained. If you're a believer in everything happens for a reason, then you'll appreciate Signs.

I admit that I kind of like it when I first saw it on 2001, and gave it a good rating and review for IMDb. However, viewing the movie again a number of times over the years showed me there are many things that are wrong with this film. Look, Renee Zellweger has a good performance (though right now, her cinematic persona has kind of overstay her welcome). The plot is basically about Bridget having to choose between dour lawyer Darcy (Colin Firth) or sexy cad Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant). Neither of them is a very satisfactory individual. Arguing who was the best guy for her, as I did in my original review is besides the point. Besides, what is more off putting about this film is that Bridget stupidity is supposed to be representative of the modern woman. I want to believe that this is not true, but unfortunately, the huge success of this film shows that many women agree with that judgment.

I quite agree with other commentators that each viewing reveals aspects that were not originally apparent. It is a complex film and has many facets and is worthy of multiple views.If you love Marcello Mastroianni then this is just about one of his finest performances. What struck me and maybe it's just my own tastes, is that for most of the film he speaks very quietly and calmly and it has such a hypnotic effect; you feel yourself relaxing and yet he's so seductive. That calm voice is in such contrast to most actors in most movies who speak as if they are on a stage where loud projection is necessary. I am not sure if it was Fellini's idea or it was Mastroianni's to speak in such subdued tones but I just so enjoy the effect.He uses this charming relaxed way with almost everyone in the film, his mistress, his wife, his friends; they all are spoken to with a soft touch. So, what does this say about the man he is portraying? Hard to say that it has a direct connection. This is supposed to be a movie director who has lost his mojo and message and is adrift in a project he cannot connect to or motivate himself into. So, you would expect that the conflict he feels, the illness he is at the spa to recuperate from would make him more high strung? And to that expectation Mastroianni plays against the grain, or at least in my imagination he does, to great success.The opening scene for me is one of the most exciting and brilliant I have seen in all of movie history. Not exciting like guns or explosives going off in all direction I mean that what Fellini has created is intellectually exciting....he has put us straight into a dream-like state, maybe the actual nightmare of the main character and we are sucked in to the frightful center in just a few seconds with such simplicity. Fellini used our imagination in place of special effects (partly because in 1963 they probably didn't exist?) mostly because our own imagination, our own unconscious is such an effective place to place an idea - our mind does all the work for us. The claustrophobia he feels as he cannot escape from his car; the silent and blank staring faces just increases the fear of a man as he attempts to escape from suffocating smoke. The entire premise of the rest of the film is setup at this point.There are many dream-like sequences in the film; one of the most effective and ghoulish is where Mastroianni escorts his father to descend back into his grave. The sight of seeing his father step further into the earth is shocking and hilarious at the same time; a great visual stunt.This is such a multi-layered and textured film and I'm not doing it the justice that a book length review could. I so much enjoy this movie. What we should remember is that as Fellini released what might be his masterpiece, the Beatles had just released their first album and the war in Vietnam was about to turn awfully nasty. In the early days of the angst of the 60's came this crazy, arty, Italian dream-fest, confusing people, delighting Fellini and Mastroinanni fans. It is at once overly serious, contemplative (Fellini looking with humor at his own self), hilarious, creatively aligned with a dadaist twist of oddness and yet seen these many years later it is still able to stir us and tickle our fancy. It has aged very well. I hope that the DVD version is cleaner than this print; the subtitles were often hard to read.

How dare someone create a game so real that we are active characters in it and that all things they see seem and feel so real.

Willem Dafoe has a unique role as a gas station attendant who has the ability to open a bio-port(the opening orifice where the umbilical cord connects in your lower back)and does so for Law. Then once inside the game he has a hard time at first adjusting to how everything works and the way it feels so real to actual life.

How is this possible? I really like this film despite it's flaws.

Jonathan finds out & wants to quit but Jonathan is a big hit with the fans & Petrovich won't let him just walk away...This American, German & Japanese co-production was co-produced & directed by John McTiernan & is pretty darn bad even by recent Hollywood big budget remake standards. The script by Larry Ferguson & John Pogue is based on the original Rollerball (1975) which I have not seen so I cannot compare the two although I find it difficult to believe that the '75 version was worse than this limp, lame, boring, repetitive mess of a film. For a start the sport of rollerball itself is never fully explained so we, the audience, lose interest in pretty much everything that happens during one of the games & also everything that surrounds it. I just couldn't relate to the sport of rollerball, it never made any reasonable sense to me & I consider myself a sports fan as I adore the football played in the English Premiership over here. I also seriously doubt that viewing figures would go up because participants are being injured or killed, I'm sorry but that assumption by the filmmakers is an insult to all proper sports fans which I cannot make any connection with. Sure we all like a bit of controversy or a bit of a punch up on the pitch & a few red cards maybe but I can't believe any so-called sport where people are deliberately (or otherwise) hurt on a regular basis would be popular, I just can't & therefore the story in Rollerball went straight over my head. The character's are poor, the dialogue rubbish & I personally never cared for anyone or anything during it's 100 odd minute duration although to give it some credit it moves along at a good pace.Director McTiernan was giving us classic action films such as Predator (1987) & Die Hard (1988) so it is rather sad to see him turn in such an awful film & an awful film on many levels. The action scenes are filmed with quick cuts, shaky cameras & with next to no regard for the audience watching this stuff, to be honest I couldn't make head nor tail of much of what was going on & the action scenes just come off as a complete mess of blink & you'll miss it imagery. Then there's the totally baffling decision to film a chase sequence with a grainy night vision camera, I sat there & thought this could have been one of the better action scenes in the film but why shoot it in green tinted night vision? Bizarre. I almost must mention the truly dire soundtrack, the horrible music was both unnecessarily loud & highly annoying, this was pretty headache inducing. The violence was really tame & disappointing, there's barely a drop of blood, no decent fights or anything to get excited about.I was astounded to see that Rollerball had a supposed budget of about $70,000,000, wow that's a hell of a lot of money to make such a poor film. I have no idea where all the money went. The acting was predictably terrible as well, what on earth is a usually good actor like Jean Reno doing in this?Rollerball is a bad film, a really bad film. It's a 70 million dollar turkey of the highest order & it making the IMDb's 'Bottom 100' is all you need to know. The only thing that appealed to me were the cool looking cars & Rebecca Romijn-Stamos in tight fitting leather outfits, other than that Rollerball is one to be avoided.
