Das Boot informs us of this, not as a final observation, but by way of introduction.  Armed with this information, one only only view the boat in question as a tomb waiting to happen.In some ways this is a very uncinematic venture.  All the action takes place within a small metal tube; even when it surfaces, the sub is visually unimpressive; enemy ships are but spray on the horizon; torpedos are fired unseen, their lethal impact heard but unwitnessed. Additionally, some of the dialogue, at least in translation, is slightly clunky.But Das Boot has great strengths.  In sharp contrast to The Perfect Storm, the same director's later return to the sea, nothing is played for melodramatic effect.  And by the conclusion of this epic story, the claustrophobic boat seems as much one's own home as that of the crew, whose understated characters one has come to appreciate through simple observation as they go about their everyday tasks.  Especially good is Jurgen Prochnow as the captain, on whose shoulders lies full responsibility for the lives of his men. His plays a true hero, but one without any halo or gloss.For those of us fortunate enough not to have lived through the war, this is a rare film that presents a plausible picture of that terrible time. By implication, the truth about today's wars is in here too, more so than in anything you'll find on CNN.  Watching it makes you realise how most other supposedly great war films aren't great at all, just the slick product of an entertainment industry. Das Boot is the real thing.

Then I saw Insomnia. I couldn't believe what I was watching. I felt like I was watching a typical Hollywood Thriller film cat and mouse game. As the time passed from opening titles to ending credits I could feel any respect and admiration for Nolan slowly seeping out of me. Don't get me wrong I still think he's a remarkable director for making films like Following and Memento, but there was something just lacking in Insomnia that he pulled off brilliantly with his two previous films. Following and Memento just had such a great Psychological deepness to them that I think part of that lacking element was the fact that in those two previous films he requires, forces and encourages you to make your brain think about what's going on in the plot. Yes he does it here to in Insomnia, but he doesn't push the envelope to it's limit, potential or barrier so to speak as much as he did with the other films. Along with Pacino questioning if he really did kill his partner he makes you question that as well. That though to me is the extent of the thinking he requires of you for this film. With Memento, if you saw it in theatres you know what I'm talking about, if you left the theatre for less then five minutes you might as well have not come back into the theatre. That's how lost you got in his labrynth of complexity he created with Memento. Following and Memento are the best examples of the style of filmmaking known as Film Noir, from the french literally meaning Black Film and those two are very dark films that explore the dark side of human nature. I couldn't get that at all with Insomnia. True I got that from Williams playing the bad guy, but with Following and Memento you get that dark side of human nature from all the characters whether their the good or bad guys. The only consulation was that I got to see a free screening of Insomnia and didn't have to waste good money to see it.

I was so appalled that I came to the IMDB site to see how badly other users had rated it.  To my astonishment it has an overall rating of about 7?!? and it seems that most of you inexplicably like it?To be more objective, I have to conceed to some good acting on Jacks part, there is some fine camera work and the scenery is beautiful. Unfortunately the story is not.The movie seems to change its mind about where its heading about 4 times. It starts as a standard detective thriller, then its about retirement escapism, then its becomes a love story and finally it remembers its meant to be about solving (or not solving) a murder and quickly wraps it all up.Ok, I understand that there is a lot of subtlety to the movie and it does explore more meaningful issues of ageing, dimentia and of course the tradgedy of the unresolved crime leading to Jacks insanity because of his unfulfilled pledge.  There is also the additional tradgedy that he was right all along and that the killer was on the way to the rondezvous before slamming into a truck, therefore destroying all hope of the mystery ever being solved.  In a nutshell Jack was an unlucky bunny.  I havent missed the irony!  These would have made excellent plot points but for the films failure to tell the story with any degree of clarity.  It tries to be clever but is just overly subtle.I just wish it hadn't taken 2 and a half hours to do it.  It really sucks you in because the direction is good and you know you are watching what should be a quality movie.  The ending however is perhaps the biggest anti climax I have ever seen.  When I first saw it I have to confess I didn't entirely get it and hadn't figured out who the killer was.  It was only when reading some of the other comments that I confirmed what had really happened.The biggest problem for me was the lack of development of the killer.  I wanted to find out why he was butchering little girls.  The film hinted at a timing pattern but never developed it.  Also, some of the earlier scenes are designed to mislead you.  When the first body is discovered the young boy sees an indian chief walking back to a pick up truck after commiting the murder. This is the only evidence we see and is the basis for the initial wrongfull arrest. Can anyone explain to me what this has to do with the killer at the end?  The real killer seems to be white caucaision and drives a large black saloon.  We never see the killer but if he is the son of the porcupine shop lady, he can't be indian.Just because a film is slow, subtle, artistic and well acted does not make it a masterpiece.  The cameo performances were well acted but what happened to Helen Mirren?  She had one scene that suggested a deeper involvement in the film and then never appeared again?Also How much time is supposed to have passed from the first murder to the end of the film.  As far as I can gather it must be at least 18 months but again its open to interpretation.Films like this are often critically acclaimed.  I think the truth is that nobody gets it first time around but most are too embarrased to admit it. The fact that eventual scrutiny allows you to reach some conclusions only allows pretentious critics to be superior and condemn anyone that doesn't understand.

Of course they get together, but the journey is a lot of fun.Quick outline Dizzy (DJ Quall) plays the typical loser in denial who one day gets stoned on painkillers or something and gets arrested for preaching in a mall. Then Eddie Griffin (the scary little inmate) gets all the other prisoners and guards to help him be cool - including the makeover by the stereotype camp guard. After Dizzy gets himself expelled he gets transferred to a new school.Then we see Dizzy the next day arrive Hannibal Lector style - which is one of the funniest things I've ever seen. This is Kyle off Road Trip scaring the pants of prison guards and all the school kids and then appearing from under the mask looking cool.Speeding up now, he becomes cool, p***es off the ex-badass by stealing his spot and girl and unites the school (nerds and jocks alike) as well as helping the football team win everything (somehow). Then the top jock from his old school appears, gets beaten up by all Dizzy's new mates and then gets his revenge by showing some of the choice exploits from Dizzy's school days.Of course Dizzy is saved from being nerdified again. Surprisingly, its the prison guards and inmates who do this by humiliating the two ex-jocks.This movie is so much fun. There is only one groan moment really and thats when Dizzy breaks his penis in front of the whole school (that was a groan of pain and sympathy). Dizzy becomes the cool kid very pretty easily and with a great deal of luck and I was supporting him every step of the way. This film has loads of cameos including David Hasselhoff and Tommy Lee Jones as well as a cast who compliment the film's style very well.I advide you all watch this, maybe drunk, maybe sober, but it is still funny as %@\/*! I'm off to watch it again now. ) ","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"29 May 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  If you read the book this version is just ridiculous! this is also in my opinion on of the worst adaption I've ever have seen, what a difference to the TV-version starring Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith almost true after the Ludlum-book (where was Carlos??!!)and Damon as the action hero looks like a college boy, what a misscasting!!

With its familiar score by Elmer Bernstein, The Great Escape puts us into a German POW camp and we go along with everybody to try to escape in this three hour film.The smorgasbord of characters include Hilts, the `Cooler King' (McQueen), who spends much of his time in isolation, Hendley, the `Scrounger' (Garner), who can get anything he wants, and Danny, the `Tunnel King' (Charles Bronson). During WWII, these people are sent to the POW camp, and decide to escape by digging three tunnels under the camp, nicknamed Tom, Dick, and Harry. If one fails, then they move onto the next. Two hours are spent on this, and the third is spent on what happens to those who escape.Wait a minute! Did I just give away the ending? No, because of two reasons. One is the title The Great Escape. It isn't called The Great Attempt to Escape. Also, the opening titles say how this is a true story, et cetera, so you know what basically happens. That doesn't mean, however, that it isn't a thrilling and enthralling piece of work. I wasn't exactly on the edge of my seat for the entire piece, but the 2 hours and 52 minutes flew by, and I didn't want to leave the film. I was engaged with everything this picture brought me an interesting ensemble of characters (alas, like all ensemble movies like this, it's hard to keep track of EVERY character), an interesting and authentic (and I mean AUTHENTIC) set, and a certain air of unpredictability. I knew what was going to happen for some of it, but what happened overall and to each individual, I had no idea.There were some very good action scenes, also. Hilts, after he escapes, is evading German officers on a motorbike (possibly the most famous sequence of the film). He did most of the stunts himself. There was never a dull moment. The set looked very authentic, and it was shot on location. Although it's obvious how they shot it, it really looked like a tunnel under a POW camp. To sum everything up, The Great Escape is a very entertaining, three-hour classic that won't disappoint you.My rating 8\/10Not Rated ","genre":null},{"date":"29 May 2003","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  Young children will know it as Chicken Run, while older folk (like myself, at the ripe old age of 14) know it as The Great Escape, the classic POW escape film from 1963 with Steve McQueen and James Garner.

I suspect this lack of development was a symptom of the problematic script  instead of explaining how a character (who earlier confessed that she would be lost without Paulie) simply begins ignoring her lover, they just chalk it up to her need to salvage a relationship with her parents (parents whom she has already professed to hate).  That being said, I still greatly enjoyed this movie, mainly because I was viewing it through the lens of a Shakespearean tragedy, which isn't too much of a stretch considering all of the Shakespeare allusions sprinkled liberally throughout.  The good thing about this movie is that even with its underdevelopment\/plot hole concerning Tori's character, it is still infinitely less convoluted and contrived than just about anything Shakespeare ever wrote.

The acting isn't bad once you get past Gregory Peck's British accent. None of the performances are outstanding, they're just not bad. The roles restrict the performers' range. I think Alida Valli smiles once. Louis Jourdan seems to have only one expression, a bitter, barely controlled anger. If he tried to smile he might crack. The actor given the best lines is Charles Laughton, who hams it up and brings a bit of life to the screen. Remarkable how the convolutions of a walnut resemble those of the human brain. And that flabby, sweaty palm as he takes the hand of Peck's wife, squeezes it lasciviously, and places it on his thigh.Well, I can think of three reasons why it's dull. (1) It's overwritten. The script needed somebody like Daryl F. Zanuck to hack out some of the underbrush. Peck is questioning Valli in court. It goes something like this Peck What did you say to Latour. Valli I told him to leave the room. Peck But why did you tell him to leave? Valli Because I no longer wanted him present. Peck And why did you no longer want him present? Valli His presence was disturbing. And so on. How did the jury stay awake? Some of the scenes are pointless. Not the sort of interesting meanders you might find in other Hitchcock movies. Just pointless. Peck visits a country house to talk to Latour, who promises to show him the garden and then beats it pronto. An hour or two later Latour shows up banging on the window of Peck's room at the inn, having changed his mind for no apparent reason. The five-minute conversation that follows could have been condensed into half that time and benefited from some supplementary bits of business. Instead the two adversaries sit there like mahogany idols hiding information from one another. That's a poor script for you.(2) Hitchcock's imagination seems to have been asleep during the shooting. Perhaps the director himself was asleep. (It happened from time to time.) It isn't necessary for every Hitchcock film to have a bravura shot in it. The camera needn't always swing down from an upper story and wind up with a closeup of the key in someone's hand. But there is, maybe, one shot in this flick that bespeaks Hitchcock. When Andre Latour is first called into the courtroom as a witness, Hitchcock keeps the camera focused on Valli's face in the defendant's chair and circles it slowly around her so that we see Jourdan walking slowly into the room past her, behind her, and can almost feel her incandescent desire to turn around and look directly at him. (3) Hitchcock had a great sense of humor and it's entirely absent from this movie. It must in fact rank among the least humorous films he's ever made. And it's surprising, because he was usually able to insert some piece of business into even his most serious works. (Not including Vertigo.) Often the humor centers around meals. A dowager stubs out a cigarette in a jar of cold cream, or the yolk of a fried egg. A police inspector is forced to eat fancy dishes that a Kurdish camel driver would turn up his nose at. Or the humor lies in montage, as in The Man Who Knew Too Much, when Jimmy Stewart escapes from a clumsy set-to with the staff at a taxidermist's and the scene ends with a shot of a stuffed lion's head gaping at the slammed door. SOMEthing, anyway, to lighten things up. But not here. Put it all together and you have a pretty dull movie, one of the several serial flops that Hitchcock ground out in the post-war period. It isn't exactly painful to sit through. It's just that it's not very enjoyable.

The level of homophobia, violence, and absolute fear of the unknown seems more reminiscent of a movie where everything is sensationalized. Unfortunately, it is based on a true story that took place during 1993, where a young woman with a sexual identity crisis was brutally murdered in Nebraska. Exceptional performances from Hillary Swank (`The Core'), Chloe Sevigny (`The Last Days of Disco') and Peter Sarsgaard (`K19 The Widowmaker'), and the marvelous direction of Kimberly Peirce make `Boys Don't Cry' a film of brutal truth.Brandon Teena (Swank) is not all he seems. Brandon is the chosen name of Teena Brandon, a lesbian who prefers to dress and act like a man. She holds herself out to be a man one night at bar and meets some guys who accept her into their group of friends. She also meets Lana (Sevigny), a girl who hates her life and wants to run away from her one horse town. The two become close friends and eventually a relationship forms, however, Lana has no idea until her first sexual experience with Brandon, that he is in fact a woman. Lana is still drawn to Brandon, though, and her secret remains safe with Lana until one of Lana's live in friends, John (Sarsgaard), finds out what is really going on. John, being jealous, a drunkard and all out 'redneck,' rapes Brandon with his friend, and eventually kills her.`Boys Don't Cry' is filled with disturbing images that easily shock the film's viewers because of the level of ignorance and violence that exist in some of the characters. John and his friend Tom spend most of the day getting drunk, high and both have a affinity for inflicting pain on one another, as one scene has Tom showing Brandon the cuts that the two inflicted upon each other in prison, just to see who could take the most pain. The scene of the rape of Brandon is extremely difficult to watch, as is the murder-both are quite grisly, and heart wrenching to endure.Hillary Swank gives the performance of her career. Her portrayal of Brandon garnished her an Oscar for Best Actress. Swank comes off so realistically as a guy, that it's difficult to believe she is actually a woman. Also, her portrayal of the pain that Brandon feels due to her differences from everyone else is done so masterfully, that one can't help but feel sorrow for her. Films like `Boys Don't Cry' send a message to filmgoers that the importance of tolerance and understanding is essential in life. No person is the same as everyone else and it's necessary that society understand that. Brandon Teena wanted nothing more than to be a man. That's not an easy thing to accept, but the point is that to the average person, it's not his or her business what kind of lifestyle someone else chooses to lead. People need to be judged on their personalities and characters, not on their preferences in life. `Boys Don't Cry' drives that message home-if we live in fear of those who are different or that which is unknown, we will bring about the destruction of our own lives, the lives of the people around us. ****  ","genre":null},{"date":"29 May 2003","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"    ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** It's hard to believe that the events portrayed in the film `Boys Don't Cry' could have actually happened.
