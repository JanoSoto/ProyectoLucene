Rodman plays Simon, the man whose sezing is responsible for our title. Rodman is a secret agent for INTERPOL who has no less than TWO comedic sidekicks constantly dressed as monks in their monastery base in France. Simon is a motorcycle riding, kickboxing super agent capable of sliding down columns with his legs so that he can shoot guns with his hands. INTERPOL is apparently one of the easiest to work for secret agencies, because Rodman apparently has no mission or assignment to work on until an old schoolmate played by stand-up comedian Dane Cook, because apparently this film needs a THIRD comedic sidekick. Dane Cook is on a mission to exchange confidential military secrets for his boss's kidnapped daughter, and he brings Rodman along for the ride. The exchange goes bad and Rodman takes charge as any good action-hero does, and together Rodman and the trio of comic relievers try to track down the kidnapped girl and the most ridiculous villain since the Number 23 played itself in the Number 23.Dane Cook manages to work in his impersonations of dogs, dinosaurs from Jurassic Park, and Chewbacca into the first twenty minutes. Remarkably none of the bits that may very well have worked on stage fit into the movie and, furthermore, since they all sound virtually identical, really come off as lame. The only difference between Cook's dinosaur and Chewbacca is that dinosaurs have tiny arms. Apparently someone thought animal noises and kickboxing equaled box-office gold; of course, if that were true, Jean-Claude Van Damme's puppet show in Branson would be a bigger draw than it is now. Although to his credit Cook gives up on his impressions, one of Rodman's sidekicks (John Pinette) does a similar whale impression, which at least is tenuously related to the film because he is fat. Hilarious, no? About 1 out of 10 of Dane Cook's lines are amusing, but since 10 out of 10 are supposed to be funny, that's not a very good batting average. During a car chase where Rodman and Cook are being chased by the bad guys, and Rodman TWICE drives for an extended distance while tilted on two tires, Cook quips, These guys are like my college loan officers, they just keep coming! There is nothing better in a cheesy action movie than a scenery-chewing villain. This is the one role where it not only acceptable to overact, it is in fact mandatory by Hollywood law. When done right, the actor who hams it up as the villain can steal a movie, as proved by the likes of Robert Patrick in the horrible WWE Films The Marine or Christopher Walken in The Rundown. Our villain Ashton is doing an effeminate, impish supervillain that's so bad he'd be more suitable to battle Pee Wee Herman than James Bond. This is the kind of villain who while menacing a colonel he's extorting says, Colonel, do us all a favor and turn that frown upside down. My favorite is this exchange between Rodman and AshtonAshton Guess what we're going to blow up first! Rodman Your ego? Ashton No, but nice try, sailor! The Eiffel Tower! Rodman Why? Ashton Because it's big and it's delicious and I'm tired of looking at it!Like any other action star, Rodman gets to dive from a building before it explodes, then walk in slow motion away from the same building as it burns. Just like a real action hero! And as he emerges, his cohorts actually say, That's our Simon! Which, if you think about it, is really dialogue more suited for a wacky, 50s sitcom rather than a cheesy, 90s action flick, but that's just my (correct) opinion.While I've never seen more than short clips of Cook's comedy act and none of his recent starring vehicles, I think he at least adds a certain charm to the film. Rodman doesn't fare so well, though the ridiculous script certainly is of no help. It ain't over, Rodman growls with what is meant to be intensity. The man really doesn't possess any kind of charisma as far as I can detect. Beyond being a very good basketball player, the only reason that Rodman is famous is due to his outrageous publicity stunts like wearing a wedding dress to a book signing or wrestling in a tag team with Hulk Hogan and thereby degrading brides, books, and professional wrestling (which is hard to do).Unless you love bad action movies as much as I do, you should stay away from this at all costs.

I haven't seen many of his extensive list of Chinese films, except for Hard Boiled, which I found less than impressive, like the spectacularly disappointing Windtalkers. Hard Target is his first effort in Hollywood, until the far superior Broken Arrow and Face\/Off. The movie bears striking resemblance to Surviving the Game, although can't be accused of stealing the idea, since that movie came out the following year.Sadly, this movie plays like a lot of bizarre action movie experiments strung along a thin and uninteresting plot. There is some goofy and distracting slow motion used during the fights, which had a strange charm in Kickboxer but just look odd here.The story is mainly about a couple guys who provide an opportunity for wealthy people to hunt and kill someone, for a cool $500,000. It has always been the privilege of the few to hunt the many, the villain explains, although the movie goes on to show that the few, to the contrary, hunt the few. That is until Van Damme's perfectly named character, Chance, becomes the hunted, in which case it is the many hunting the one. And not doing such a bang-up job of it, either (It appears your trophy is ripping us a new orifice!).The setting is New Orleans, which for some reason seems to be totally deserted (except for a single scene that I can think of at the moment), giving the movie a cheap soundstage feel, and features a paper thin movie villain who's only bit of personality comes from his sidekick. I can't remember his name so I'll just call him Imhotep.Huge amounts of money are mentioned throughout the film, I suppose to remind us that we are dealing with people who think nothing of $500,000 or $750,000, but when you toss in numbers that big it just starts to feel fake and contrived, like in Sudden Death, where the bad guy wanted to steal something like $2,000,000,000. Why not $20 billion? Or how about a bazillion? That would be exciting.As I said, the plot is unimportant. Ultimately we get a situation where Chance is being pursued by the bad guys, although this time not some rich lunatic who wants to feel the power of killing another man, but by about 20 guys who get in on the hunt for $750,000 each. I can't remember if they were charged that much or paid that much, but it's telling that it really doesn't matter, neither situation would work. Why would anyone pay that much money to kill someone? And even if they would, where does Fouchon (Henriksen) find these guys? And there were more than 20 of them, so if he's paying them, why would he blow more than $15,000,000 just to kill one guy? Clearly there is not a lot of thought put into this screenplay&#133; Anyway, we get a lot of action clichés, which sadly seem to be something that John Woo is really good at. I especially love the scene where Chance punches a rattlesnake in the head and then bites off its rattle, so that the bad guys chasing him won't hear it rattle just before it attacks them. Truly bizarre, but unique, to be sure. There is also a scene where Chance kicks a gas can (that is clearly almost completely empty) at a bad guy, and then he shoots it and it explodes like it was full of nitro-glycerine. Hey, maybe it was.Ultimately, the movie culminates in the same shootout we've seen 1000 times, except that this time it's not just an old warehouse, but an old warehouse full of what appear to be parade floats. I hadn't seen that in a movie before. It's a unique set, to be sure, but if nothing else, the cartoonish villain (a criminally misused Lance Henriksen) ruins it when he loses his temper and starts firing pot shots at the floats, which explode like fireworks. Then there is the matter of the anonymous motorcyclist bad guys, who are dressed from head to toe in black and literally pop up exactly like pop-up targets to be easily picked off one by one, just like the bad guys did in Windtalkers.John Woo always overdoes his gunfights, and here is no exception. Every bad guy literally gets shot 10 or 12 times (except for Fouchon, who gets shot about twice as many times), but at least Chance remembers to reload, pulling one clip after another out of the back pocket of those skin tight jeans.If nothing else, at least the movie provides a brief educational lesson about military hardware near the end. You may not have known this before, but evidently you can just untwist a live grenade like a soda bottle to diffuse it. Imagine if that knowledge fell into the wrong hands! The movie ends with a Creedence Clearwater Revival song that has appropriate lyrics for the movie but is otherwise totally out of the blue and musically just doesn't fit. The rest of the soundtrack seems to have been inspired by Van Damme's hair, which is probably the most memorable thing about the movie.In his first American action effort, John Woo swings&#133;and misses...

Then there is the matter of the anonymous motorcyclist bad guys, who are dressed from head to toe in black and literally pop up exactly like pop-up targets to be easily picked off one by one, just like the bad guys did in Windtalkers.John Woo always overdoes his gunfights, and here is no exception. Every bad guy literally gets shot 10 or 12 times (except for Fouchon, who gets shot about twice as many times), but at least Chance remembers to reload, pulling one clip after another out of the back pocket of those skin tight jeans.If nothing else, at least the movie provides a brief educational lesson about military hardware near the end. You may not have known this before, but evidently you can just untwist a live grenade like a soda bottle to diffuse it. Imagine if that knowledge fell into the wrong hands! The movie ends with a Creedence Clearwater Revival song that has appropriate lyrics for the movie but is otherwise totally out of the blue and musically just doesn't fit. The rest of the soundtrack seems to have been inspired by Van Damme's hair, which is probably the most memorable thing about the movie.In his first American action effort, John Woo swings&#133;and misses...

For the most part, his movies feature horrors of a human nature. The two that come first to my mind are 'Psycho' and 'Rebecca.' 'The Birds' has a more Steven King style of story-telling, in which something otherwise innocuous quite unexpectedly goes berserk. As he himself once explained; 'the familiar fabric of life can come unravelled with shocking suddenness'.During the first part of the movie, we are treated to a comedy of manners amongst sophisticated individuals. Tippi Hedren plays 'society girl' Melanie Daniels, out to score flirty points off an upstart lawyer, acted rather oleaginously by Robert Taylor.She pays a clandestine visit to his mother's country house out in the coastal boondocks called Bodega Bay. And it's here that Mr King appears to take over the script. Beginning with a few isolated attacks, 'The Birds' descends into a truly horrific idea. They have all become organised and cooperative. And they want us dead. The attack scenes quite beggar belief. These aren't special-effects or CGI; these are real birds. Big, dangerous ones like crows and gulls. And although they were trained to their task, it didn't stop one of the girls (I believe it was Ms Hedren) being pecked so badly that she was actually scarred.The caws and shrieks are loud and aggressively modulated to highlight their new-found ferocity. Even today some of the scenes of bloodied victims struggling under multiple attack are shocking. Hedren's character shelters in a telephone box whilst rabid birds hurl themselves at the windows, shattering them in death. A man staggers up, his face a ripped, red mask, unable to think under the onslaught let alone see.Then the raid abates, and the dazed community try to make sense of the impossible thing that just happened.All of the characters are extremely plausible and accurately represent the social and sexual politics of the day (1963). Modern feminists might find the strident hysteria and sal-volatile weepiness of their gender portrayal a little hard to stomach today; well - I'm sorry girls - but that's more or less what we blokes had to put up with back then. In a crisis, men not only did everything; they were bleeding expected to do everything. You don't know how grateful we are for Ellen Ripley.As other commentators have mentioned; if you like explanations and nice neat denouements, this movie isn't for you. The subjects just go quietly into the night, leaving the theatre to the birds. You don't even know if they make it or not. They disappear into the distance with the harsh braying of crows sounding almost like victory jeers.Modern horror movies like 'Aliens' and 'Species' have raised the shock threshold way beyond this now, but for those of us who saw this frightener during the 60's, our feathered friends have never seemed quite the same. And they are right here, with us. 'Aliens' are just a remote fantasy.

Dolph Lundgren plays an embittered American soldier, consumed with anger about his fellow soldiers who have been killed in the war, and intent on taking it out on any Vietnamese people he can find. Luc (Van Damme) insists that the village has been cleared and those people have done nothing wrong, and the ensuing conflict leads to both of them killing each other before the opening credits are even over. The dead soldiers are declared M.I.A., not because their having killed each other would be a little difficult to explain, but because they are needed for a new kind of military technology.Now here's where I get a little lost. We cut to the Present Day Nevada Desert, 25 years later. You'll notice that 25 years after 1968 you'll find 1993, the year after this movie was released. I supposed the original audiences were left in complete terror about what was going to take place around the following Spring. The rest of us may wonder why the movie markets itself as being a story about futuristic military technology, when it takes place about 5-6 months after the release date.At any rate, we are immediately taken to a tense hostage situation that is taking place, if I'm not mistaken, on the Hoover Dam, so that the new cyborg-soldiers could be put to the test (a full quarter of a century after they were made). Truly they are impressive pieces of machinery (or whatever they are), and the situation is soon under control. The local news outlets gleefully report that the situation has been taken care of, and with no casualties or injuries. Maybe they forgot about the dozen or so innocent people that had been machine gunned right there in the middle of the road in broad daylight. Or maybe they just don't count.The movie plays around a lot with what Luc and Andrew Scott (Lundgren) have become. There's a scene where, after Luc begins having flashbacks of Vietnam and escapes with an attractive reporter (who was fired for being late to the scene), he walks outside naked as the day he was born, explaining that he's hot. You see, one of the symptoms of the new soldiers is that their body temperature runs hot, so they have to sleep in refrigerated compartments to avoid overheating. Soon after that, they are discovered, so Luc (now named GR-44) asks Veronica, the reporter, to examine his naked, chiseled body and look for where they have hidden the tracking device. Look for something unusual, he tells her. Something hard. Clearly, the ideas lifted by the boatload from the Terminator movies need not be named. I have only room for 1,000 words here, and to list the borrowed ideas would take more than that. But even though there are literally scenes lifted directly from the Terminators (like the café scene where GR-44 casually beats the crap out of everyone in sight), the movie never feels like a rip-off. Maybe that's because, for all the bad rap he gets, Van Damme has a definite, undeniable on screen charm. At one point, not long after they've met, Veronica asks him where he's from. I figured you gotta be French or something, she says, because of your accent. What accent? he asks. He seems genuinely confused. The movie sort of descends into routine action clichés by the time GR's 13 (Lundgren) and 44 start having flashbacks, and start to remember that they killed each other and hence have unfinished business. It seems that they revert to the emotion that they had at the time they died, so GR-13 wants vengeance of anyone within shooting distance, while GR-44 just wants to go home. Thus we get the government-made super-soldiers trying to kill each other. This leads to a half amusing and half disturbing scene where GR-13 terrorizes some astonished civilians in a supermarket (while another GR mindlessly gnaws on a raw steak), and then ultimately to the obligatory final showdown.I found the explanation for the transformation particularly interesting. I feel like, in science fiction movies, how the 'fiction' is explained is where most of the creativity lies. Sadly, there's not much here. A scientist explains to Veronica how it all worked. By hyper-accelerating the bodies, we discovered that we could turn dead flesh into living tissue. Hyper-accelerating? Is that how they got the soldiers to age super-slow? Or not at all, and for 25 years? Sadly, we may never know. When Veronica replies, What are you saying, doctor? there is a knock at the door, so he doesn't really have time to explain. Too bad.There's not much to be said about the ending. It's the worst part of the movie, by far. An enormous copout the likes of which is rarely seen even in bad b-movies. But I should also mention that the movie is not as bad as the ending, or even as bad as many people say. It's not a science fiction classic, but it's a fun action popcorn movie, like many of Van Damme's films. If nothing else, the movie teaches us a valuable lesson - don't throw a beer can at a man wearing a necklace made out of human ears.Note At the Cannes Film Festival when Universal Soldier was released, Van Damme and Lundgren got into an argument and then a shoving match right there on the red carpet in front of the world's cameras (you can check it out on YouTube). Many lament that we may never know if it was real or just a publicity stunt. It definitely looked real to me, but if it wasn't, then all the mystery around it must mean that they really CAN act!

It seems that they revert to the emotion that they had at the time they died, so GR-13 wants vengeance of anyone within shooting distance, while GR-44 just wants to go home. Thus we get the government-made super-soldiers trying to kill each other. This leads to a half amusing and half disturbing scene where GR-13 terrorizes some astonished civilians in a supermarket (while another GR mindlessly gnaws on a raw steak), and then ultimately to the obligatory final showdown.I found the explanation for the transformation particularly interesting. I feel like, in science fiction movies, how the 'fiction' is explained is where most of the creativity lies. Sadly, there's not much here. A scientist explains to Veronica how it all worked. By hyper-accelerating the bodies, we discovered that we could turn dead flesh into living tissue. Hyper-accelerating? Is that how they got the soldiers to age super-slow? Or not at all, and for 25 years? Sadly, we may never know. When Veronica replies, What are you saying, doctor? there is a knock at the door, so he doesn't really have time to explain. Too bad.There's not much to be said about the ending. It's the worst part of the movie, by far. An enormous copout the likes of which is rarely seen even in bad b-movies. But I should also mention that the movie is not as bad as the ending, or even as bad as many people say. It's not a science fiction classic, but it's a fun action popcorn movie, like many of Van Damme's films. If nothing else, the movie teaches us a valuable lesson - don't throw a beer can at a man wearing a necklace made out of human ears.Note At the Cannes Film Festival when Universal Soldier was released, Van Damme and Lundgren got into an argument and then a shoving match right there on the red carpet in front of the world's cameras (you can check it out on YouTube). Many lament that we may never know if it was real or just a publicity stunt. It definitely looked real to me, but if it wasn't, then all the mystery around it must mean that they really CAN act!

That story is also great with a man who is not afraid of any new technology having a big obsession with his new invention a device that can transport matter from one place to another.

Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has successfully been cloned, after 7 clones gone wrong, with the alien queen inside her by scientists (Brad Dourif, J.E. Freeman) on the ship Auriga. Ripley has alien DNA in her blood and seems to take on a few alien characteristics. The ship researches the queen and uses her eggs to facehug kidnapped people, for the purpose of studying the aliens that pop out of them. Soon a group of smugglers led by the tough Elgin (Michael Wincott), Johner (Ron Perlman), Call (Winona Ryder), and two or three others, board the Auriga to collect owed money. However the aliens soon escape and run rampant all over the ship, just as the smugglers begin pulling guns on the crew. Almost everyone on the ship has been killed by the aliens. And when the smugglers find out the ship is automatically headed back to Earth, they band together with Ripley, a scientist, soldier, and a man who has an alien in his chest. They have to find a way to stop the ship before it lands on Earth, and the aliens infest home planet.Alien and Aliens are sci-fi horror classics. Alien 3 is much less favored, but it's still one of my favorites. However I can't deny that Alien 3 is way better than the awful 4th Alien Resurrection. Even the new Aliens vs. Predator Requiem is better than this movie. Alien Resurrection contains dangerously low character development, mostly bad acting, a terrible script, and a completely different style from the first three films. The first three Aliens were very dimly lit to the point where it was hard to see the whole creature. That effect really added to their mystique. However Alien Resurrection leaves leaves nothing to be wondered about, since it is disappointingly brightly lit up. The bright atmosphere felt all wrong because the aliens don't really belong in the light, they belong in the dark. We can see the whole entire alien in their slimy brilliance, and there are actually a few good scenes with them. The scene where they escape from their containment by killing one of their own, and letting his blood burn through the floor creating an exit. This is one hell of a scene and most definitely the best part of the whole movie. It shows that the aliens may seem like mindless killers, but they are actually kind of intelligent. Other than the terrible CGI action scenes (where the aliens seem out of place), the aliens actually look great. In fact the close-up shots of them are fantastic, and really make them look hugely threatening and creepy. But then we get extremely Hollywood-style action scenes such as when the aliens attack underwater. It's scenes like this one that even further ruined the movie and the creatures.Once you get past the great looking aliens, you realize how stupid and shallow the whole movie really is. The band of smugglers are basically one-dimensional (save for Winona Ryder), as are the scientists, soldiers, and pretty much everyone else who shows up on screen. The acting is poor but what can you expect, the actors were given terrible material to work with. Upsettingly Sigourney Weaver is not good in this movie either, but then again she is just like the rest of the actors, her dialogue and character are awful. I think it was really stupid to bring her back into the series. She killed herself...that should have been final enough! They could have done an Alien movie without Ripley, but I guess since Weaver decided to come back the filmmakers just said Let's find the most preposterous way to bring back Ripley from her suicidal grave. I got an idea, she can be an alien\/human clone with no personality. Alright high fives all around! These terrible human characters are housed by an absurd, shoddy plot that makes absolutely no sense. Ripley apparently has alien features within her, but this is barely mentioned or played on till the end. There is also a side-plot that the scientists are breeding aliens through kidnapped civilians, but it's really only mentioned once or twice. These extra little side-plots don't really matter to the story once the crappy action cranks up. It doesn't even make sense how all the aliens got loose. We only see two aliens escape their cell, but how do ten more get out? This is an enormous plot hole that made me laugh at how stupid the writers must be. There is another scene that also makes zero sense, and that is when the characters swim away from an alien underwater. They break through a cocoon covering an opening to the surface, and when they get through they realize they are surrounded by eggs hatching facehuggers. One of them yells They set a trap! It's an ambush!. We find out at the end that the queen never moved from her cell, and if that's so then how the hell did all those hundreds of eggs get there for this ambush. And even if this was plausible, which it's not, why would the aliens need to put all those eggs there? They already wiped out pretty much the whole ship's crew.Alien Resurrection is a pretty awful film. Its story, characters, and even its action are all extremely shallow. Just about every single element in this third sequel barely makes any comprehensible sense. The only good thing were the close-ups of the aliens, they looked very good here. But everything else about them felt misplaced in this action flick. And don't even get me started on the whole newborn plot at the end. That was just painful to look at and think of.

You can't see them, but you can hear them, ker-k-link, each in succession, right around your sound stage. The noise tells you that they haven't just latched, but latched and locked. Listen with you eyes shut, if you don't believe me. It's that meticulous attention to detail both aural and visual that makes this movie a true work of art. There really is no need for the sounds to be there at all. But they are, and they convey complete fidelity to a scene that lasts just seconds. Here's another. When the marines are crossing the rain-swept depot to the airlock, its windy and wild. When they get inside, the ambiance completely changes. it's still noisy, the wind continues, faint but audible and there is lots of dripping water, but now there's also a strange, claustrophobic intimacy, and I'm quite at a loss as to how that has been accomplished. Yet the mood-change is hair-raisingly palpable. These set pieces are completely seamless throughout the movie. Strange, gloomy, suggestive, broken; the ghost of dead technology appears to haunt them as much as any alien demons. A thin, whining, electronic note does the work of tense music, it suits the circumstances perfectly, as well as providing a foil to any ambient sounds that the engineers and director thought appropriate.   The sound and sets earned it two well-deserved Oscars.Tension builds and builds again. It's a fairly well-worn formula of gradual attrition. Ripley's valliant rescue of the ambushed and trapped space-marines must have any viewer at the edge of their seat. And on it goes, tighter and tighter, until finally we are squeezing through air-ducts. Acting is pretty formulaic but entirely believable. People we've quickly grown to like get killed suddenly and nastily, smug Apone, and macho Drake. The alien queen brings the movie to a perfect climax.

It draws from a simple Darwinian premise, that she makes a greater investment in the production of the young, and will therefore go to more determined and ruthless lengths to ensure their survival.

I've always liked Michael Keaton's style and delivery. He was a perfect fit for the movie.I am surprised to see some of the low ratings for this movie. I grant you yes it's no Oscar winner but it does have decent comedic value. It's more of a subtle comedy rather than a all-out comedy farce. I also find some of those that felt this was an inaccurate film on cultural and business differences. I beg to differ. I grant you again that there are a lot of generalities and dramatizations but then again this is Hollywood film not a documentary. From what I've read about differences between Automakers on both sides of the Pacific at that time many of the principle ideas were accurate for the time.Some of the basic differences were that Japanese workers made to feel as part of the company as a whole. Teamwork was emphasized. They perhaps made the company above all else. Where American workers had more of a management verses labor type of relationship. The individual was more important than the company. I'll probably get some hate email over that comment I'm sure.Another difference was how quality was viewed and whose responsibility it was to fix. In many Japanese plants defects or problems are examined and fixed at the time it is discovered. Rather as one character in the movie put it it was the dealers(meaning car dealer) problem.Many of these things are probably dated but I'm sure some are still around as many US car makers are still struggling to keep up with the Japanese. If one is more interested in the subject of American, European and Japanese automakers I can recommend a book that studies this subject in more detail and was done around the same time period. The book is called The machine that changed the world by James Womack, Daniel Jones and Daniel Roos. It's about a study of automakers during and before the time period that this movie covers.

As an aside to those who like to caricature Christians, it might be worth noting that fundamentalist Christians represent only a small portion of those who would claim the name Christian, but they do get a disproportionate amount of attention - as do ultra-liberal Christians for that matter. As a Christian (non-fundamentalist, non ultra-liberal, non-extremist and quite mainstream; as one who accepts both the divinity and sacrifice of Jesus and the truth of the Scriptures) I found this movie to be both quite moving and very challenging. As is pointed out in a disclaimer at the movie's beginning, the story is not based on the Gospels (except very loosely in the sense that many of the scenes in the Gospels are included, up to and including the crucifixion) but rather is a representation of the spiritual journey of Nikos Kazantzakis, the writer of the novel on which this movie is based. The most controversial part of the movie is probably the last half hour or so, in which Jesus is depicted as a man living in intimate relationship with two women (both Mary and Martha - the sisters of Lazarus) with children and (eventually) grandchildren, living a comfortable and happy life. What the critics seem to have missed is that this was - as the title implies - Satan's last temptation to Jesus, in a desperate attempt to get him off the cross - a futile attempt in the end, as Jesus is clearly portrayed as having overcome the temptation. It is accomplished, he cries from the cross. Some argue that this shouldn't have tempted Jesus, because Jesus as divine was therefore perfect. But theologically, Jesus' perfection rests on his ability to overcome temptation, not to avoid it. Why would this last temptation be any more offensive than any other temptation - such as Satan offered him in the wilderness. Of course Jesus could be tempted. Of course, Jesus could have succumbed to temptation - otherwise the biblical accounts of Jesus being tempted in the wilderness are pointless. The perfection of Jesus is displayed in his choosing not to give in to temptation when he could have chosen to give in to temptation.The portrayal of Jesus in the first two hours of the movie might have caused some angst - portraying, as it does, a confused and fearful Jesus, struggling with God's call and uncertain how to proceed. (Although Luke's Gospel does affirm that Jesus had to grow in wisdom.) Hats off to Willem Dafoe for his portrayal of Jesus. I've never really been a huge fan of Dafoe, but thought he nailed this part perfectly - perhaps the best film portrayal of Jesus I've seen. Harvey Keitel presented an equally fascinating portrayal of Judas Iscariot, who is, in a sense, the hero of this movie in that he's the one who, in the end, jolts Jesus out of the temptation and back to reality. Another performance worth mentioning is that of Juliette Caton - the young actress who portrayed Satan pretending to be Jesus' guardian angel sent to take him off the cross. She was quite good in the role (and presented, to me, a convincing portrayal of Satan - unthreatening, innocent, concerned.) I've never seen her in anything else, but based on this one performance, I'm surprised her acting career doesn't seem to have gone much farther.What more is to say. It's interesting to compare this to The Passion Of The Christ, a movie that also aroused deep feelings both for and against. I liked Passion. I thought it was a very well done account of the crucifixion, which is what it was meant to portray. I have to say, though, that I thought Last Temptation was better. It's a superb movie that both challenges and deepens faith. It's a superb movie that flies by and that keeps you glued to the screen from start to finish. If Passion is a 9 - which I voted it - then Last Temptation has to be a 10. It's the superior movie.

The perfection of Jesus is displayed in his choosing not to give in to temptation when he could have chosen to give in to temptation.The portrayal of Jesus in the first two hours of the movie might have caused some angst - portraying, as it does, a confused and fearful Jesus, struggling with God's call and uncertain how to proceed. (Although Luke's Gospel does affirm that Jesus had to grow in wisdom.) Hats off to Willem Dafoe for his portrayal of Jesus. I've never really been a huge fan of Dafoe, but thought he nailed this part perfectly - perhaps the best film portrayal of Jesus I've seen. Harvey Keitel presented an equally fascinating portrayal of Judas Iscariot, who is, in a sense, the hero of this movie in that he's the one who, in the end, jolts Jesus out of the temptation and back to reality. Another performance worth mentioning is that of Juliette Caton - the young actress who portrayed Satan pretending to be Jesus' guardian angel sent to take him off the cross. She was quite good in the role (and presented, to me, a convincing portrayal of Satan - unthreatening, innocent, concerned.) I've never seen her in anything else, but based on this one performance, I'm surprised her acting career doesn't seem to have gone much farther.What more is to say. It's interesting to compare this to The Passion Of The Christ, a movie that also aroused deep feelings both for and against. I liked Passion. I thought it was a very well done account of the crucifixion, which is what it was meant to portray. I have to say, though, that I thought Last Temptation was better. It's a superb movie that both challenges and deepens faith. It's a superb movie that flies by and that keeps you glued to the screen from start to finish. If Passion is a 9 - which I voted it - then Last Temptation has to be a 10. It's the superior movie.

But this is no ordinary bad movie. This was a Superman movie about one of the greatest superheroes of all time. This was the fourth in the series and expectations were high. Everyone involved in making this movie failed and let everyone down. Superman IV The Quest for Peace had a lot of potential to be a good movie, but it was put in the wrong hands.One thing that I must point out is how they ruined the film's villain. Nuclear Man could've been a great villain, but like I said, this movie was put into the wrong hands. What a lot of people don't know is that in the original cut, there were two Nuclear Men. The first was the inferior one that resembled Bizarro from the comics. Nuclear Man came from one of Superman's hairs. The deleted scenes of the first Nuclear Man were pretty good. The fight scene between Superman and the first Nuclear Man was very good. He gives Superman a rough time for a little while, but Superman is able to dispose of him quickly.This forces Lex Luthor to go back to the drawing board and create a new Nuclear Man. But rather than create him in the lab, Luthor creates the new one in the sun. The special effects were pretty lame, but for me, one of their brightest moments has to be the birth of Nuclear Man from the sun. When we first see his face there is fire in his eyes and it looks pretty cool. This is the new and improved Nuclear Man played by Mark Pillow. This is a handsome Nuclear Man with blonde hair and blue eyes. He is big and strong and all he wants to do is destroy Superman. Nobody will ever know how good an actor Mark Pillow could've been. Nuclear Man's voice is dubbed by Gene Hackman's. The first voice that Nuclear Man hears when he arrives on earth is the voice of Lex Luthor. He ends up taking Luthor's voice. I could understand them dubbing Pillow because if you've ever heard his voice, he sounds too nice to be a big mean villain. But I don't know why they had to dub his voice with Gene Hackman's. Giving him the stupid roar didn't help either. Sometimes Mark Pillow overacts with his facial expressions. I swear, I think this is the new man of a thousand faces. He has how many different faces throughout the movie. You would think it was all different actors playing the part. Mark Pillow has some good moments, but some of the best scenes of Superman chasing Nuclear Man around the world ended up on the cutting room floor. They also cut out good scenes involving Lacy and Nuclear Man. These deleted scenes in the original cut explained what woman Nuclear Man was after and why. Cutting out all of those scenes that they did, destroyed any last chance they ever had of this being a good movie. The Lacy and Nuclear Man scenes also added a lot more to the character of Nuclear Man.They didn't know what they were doing. If you're going to create your own Superman foe, make sure you do it right. Nuclear Man's costume is all right. But they had to go and give him these stupid long nails to attack Superman with. The point of giving him the nails was to pierce Superman's skin and give him radiation sickness. But nobody wants a villain with long radioactive nails.Another thing they really screwed up with were the fight scenes between Superman and Nuclear Man. The fights just came off looking gay. They have their final fight on the moon and you're expecting this titanic struggle. What a let down. I'll admit, the fight has a few good moments, but whoever did the choreography is an idiot.The greatest sin of this movie is what they did to Superman. Superman was completely ruined. I blame the producers, the director, the writers, and I'm sorry to say, I blame Christopher Reeve. The last time we saw Christopher Reeve in Superman III he looked great. He looked more muscular and he was better than ever. In Superman IV he is skinny and doesn't even come close to the way he looked in Superman III. If you don't want to see them turn Superman into a big sissy then stay away from this movie. In the fights with Nuclear Man, Superman fights like a girl and looks like the biggest wimp when he's moaning and yelling while Nuclear Man's murdering him. It's painful to watch the Man of Steel act this way. It's especially painful to watch Nuclear Man end the moon fight by hammering Superman into the ground. Did anybody realize how stupid that looked? Didn't Christopher Reeve realize how stupid he looked? Someone once said that the saddest thing in life is wasted talent. A great score here by Alexander Courage is wasted. Every actor was wasted. In John Cryer's case, he had no business in this movie. He ruined it with his stupid annoying act. In the Mark Pillow case, I'd have to say that his good looks were wasted. Mark Pillow was a handsome strapping young actor. I could've seen him playing He-Man or even Flash Gordon. He definitely had the look. As far as his acting, we will never know. This movie destroyed his career before it even began. I wish people could've shut down this project before it even began. They ruined a promising movie, they ruined the characters, and they ruined the series.
