His stories are daringly sexual orientated (for its time of course) and is attracting all kinds of people. Amazingly enough the story is even supposedly based on a true story, although of course the movie story-wise took some liberties, with its characters as well.The movie doesn't only focus on its main manipulative character but also those around him, who basically each have an own motive and story-line in the movie but are of course all connected with each through the stories and the Marquis de Sade personally. It of course helps in this that all of the characters are being portrayed by some excellent actors.It's not your typical costumes drama and it also isn't a typical Philip Kaufman movie. Kaufman doesn't direct often or many movies but when he does it normally is always something good and also special, that is just a bit different from the usual genre movie the movie gets made in. Of course this movie features a lot of sexual undertone, which gives the movie a special and also yet somehow unpleasant kind of atmosphere, which I mean in a positive way.As could be expected, the dialog for this film is amazing. It's deliciously old fashioned and often poetic. Really some Shakespearian like written here. And again, it really helps that the movie has some great actors delivering the lines.Geoffrey Rush is a real scene stealer and no wonder he received an Oscar nomination for his role in this movie. It further more features the other multiple nominee- and Oscar winners such as Michael Caine, Kate Winslet and Joaquin Phoenix. The four principal actors, as of yet, share a total of 13 Oscar nominations and 3 wins. It says something about their qualities and the acting performances in this movie.Of course the movie is also great looking with its sets and costumes as well as with its cinematography and directing style.On a downside note, the movie tends to be a bit overlong. Even though the movie is just over 2 hours long, it still feels much longer and it gives you the feeling the movie should had reached its conclusion earlier on. It's not that the movie ever bores, it just starts to drag a bit as it heads toward its ending.A special kind of movie that is worth watching.8\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"30 June 2008","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The movie features a great and original story of a writer, who happens to be an insane asylum inmate, during the Napoleonic era who through his writing knows to manipulate and control everyone around him, of all levels of society.

Especially Capra's directing is disappointing, since it's done in such an extremely old fashioned manner for 1934 standards. Surprisingly enough he still won an Oscar for his directing of this movie though.It's definitely an entertaining enough movie to watch. These type of movies were the romantic comedies of the '30's, the sort of Cameron Diaz and Asthon Kutcher flicks of their time, only done with more class and better actors involved. Nevertheless it's just as clich√©d and predictable though. Dozens of these type of movies got made in the '30's and quite frankly I just can't see what it is that makes this movie a better one than any of them.It's a boy meets girl story and of course they can't get along at first but slowly begin to like each other better and more. What makes this movie its story more special is its adventurous elements being thrown in. It's a movie that involves lots of traveling and therefor also many different characters, which mainly gives the movie its adventurous feeling, without ever really getting a big adventure.More fireworks was to be expected, especially from Frank Capra's directing. It's just too formulaic and at times even just plain poor. It's way too old fashioned for 1934 and it's one of those typical movies that features long close-ups for the dramatic moments. It's a very static made film, as if it was just a job that had to be done and no real passion was thrown into it.As could be expected, the acting is still great though, from Clark Gable and the much more unknown Claudette Colbert. They were good together and luckily shared some good chemistry, which made the movie all the more fun to watch. This was actually the movie that earned Clark Gable his only Oscar out of his career. Ironicly enough non of the actors really enjoyed starring in this movie and also lots of well known actor turned the script down and Claudette Colbert, who also received an Oscar for her role in this movie, even didn't took the trouble to attend the award ceremony at first, until hearing upon her win.Yes, I know I'm making the movie sound horrible, which it really isn't. It's basically a movie I enjoyed watching but is no way worthy of this currently high rating on here. There are way better genre movies and Capra movies, with a much lower rating on here though.

Then again I shant fault the actors too much, as they (with some notable exceptions) are the only possibly redeemable aspect of the movie. What makes it often unbearable is that beneath its ham-fisted message- yes, we get it, interracial marriage, not a bad thing, fine, don't beat us over the head with a shovel anymore- is a premise that is just flat out incredulous. Maybe Stanley Kramer, the quintessential MESSAGE producer\/director of his day who could be clever as a producer but barely ever as director, believed William Rose's script. Kramer neglected to see that the premise is truly unbelievable, as are many of the characters in a context that makes them seem dated EVEN FOR 1967! The essential problem, is the conditions of and the interaction\/history of the two lead characters played by Sidney Poitier and Katharine Houghton. Potier plays a brilliant doctor who, as we're told, has gone through more training and schooling than most doctors get to by the time they're 45, let alone 37. The girl he falls in love with and decides to marry *over the course of 10 days* is practically a twit who decides to tell her parents (Tracy and Hepburn) about eloping and marriage plans on the first meet-and-greet at the parents home. THEN, without telling the future Mrs. Prentice, he tells the Drayton parents that it's up to them, over the single course of tonight's dinner, if they want him to be their daughter's husband.It's not about interracial marriage as the subject that is troubling about the film, albeit that is handled with a kind of solemnity and, dare I say it, boring attitude that I blame mostly on Kramer. It's about a basic romantic premise that doesn't hold a drop of water, and is even sexist to a fault while trying to promote racial tolerance (whether it's equality I can't say for certain). Had they been a longer term couple, maybe there would be more to see in the angle of the interracial marriage. Call me crazy, but it was something that I could not get by, and it kept holding up the characters' own internal logic.And did I mention Rose's clever little bits to try and make comparisons to how the characters act or feel? The trip with the Drayton's to the ice cream parlor, and Mr. Drayton's response to the 'new' ice cream, would be so laughable if it weren't meant to be taken dead-seriously (one hits a hand over the head in seeing the ineptitude). Or that supposedly soul-stirring speech Tracy gives in the last scene that goes against his logic earlier on (and don't say that 'well, he was a racist', since this is the movie's primary manipulation on the audience). And some scenes are just written with an agenda that, liberal, conservative, alien, is so obvious as to seem riddled with problems from page one; it's simply one of the biggest 'what-the-hell' moments of the Academy's history awarding it best original screenplay.Guess Who's Coming to Dinner was not something I dreaded seeing, far from it. I heard the hype, I like the actors, and I was hoping that it could go hand-in-hand with the really amazing In the Heat of the Night as another great statement movie. Suffice to say, at least the actors tried a little. Poitier is charismatic, compelling, and in one scene with the character's father is close to dynamite (if, of course, never as good as in the Norman Jewison film). Tracy, in his last gasp of a performance, does what he can with dialog that suits him well. Hepburn and especially her niece Houghton, however, are often not very good at all, pouting or putting on less than one emotion for a scene that's required (Hepburn, like Tracy, also tries to give it some spark here and there, while Houghton pretty much got on the ticket probably as a favor from her aunt since, clearly, she is not a good actress).But, at the end of it all, it's overrated pablum that speaks to its core audience- guilty white liberals- while trying to reel in the country which, at the time, were adverse to the idea of black and whites marrying. And it's not that an interesting movie can't be made on the subject or something similar (even, yes, today when the subject seems to not be as much of an issue). What Kramer has fashioned, however, is a work with so much importance that the subject itself clouds the judgment of better film-making and storytelling and character development and all those things that make good movies.

Just look at the IMDb rating and you'll see I'm not the only one who feels this way. To me it as good as the first.The acting may have been better than the acting in the original. Robert De Niro gave a perfect subtle performance as Vito Corleone. His portrayal was powerful and breathtaking. When I think De Niro I definitely do not think subtle and smooth but that is exactly what he was in here. It is definitely one of his top three performances in his career. The depth in his portrayal was able to justify the Vito Corleone that Marlon Brando portrayed in the first. Al Pacino gave a very strong performance playing Michael Corleone. In here we get to see more of the tough decisions that have to be made and the consequences of certain actions. Al Pacino perfectly displayed the amount of thought and struggle that goes into and comes out of every action you make; the way it affects relationships, family, power and influence. Diane Keaton was not really given a lot of room to act in the first but in here she is very good. She did not play the stereotypical wife who always stands behind her husband but rather the woman with a mind of her own who is willing to go after what she feels she deserves. Robert Duvall again to me was the glue to the movie. Just having him in there kind of makes you feel safe. John Cazale also had more of an impact in here than in the first playing the half-witted brother always needing to be bailed out. A lot of these characters sound so familiar and stereotypical but in The Godfather Part II every character is played out with such extraordinary depth. Everyone from Talia Shire who gave a fine performance to Lee Strasberg all the way down to the kid who played young Vito Corleone were perfect. Part II seems to me to be more of a character study than the original.The directing once again is perfect. Francis Ford Coppola know or at least knew how to make a movie. The first to Godfather movie are done so precisely and perfectly that nothing really sticks out because they are so perfect throughout. Coppola just lets his actors play everything out as he should with type of cast he has here. Not to many movies can maintain such a consistent flow over 3 hours let alone even an hour and 45 minutes.The writing may not have been quite as good as the first in terms of quoting but the storyline was perfect. Seeing the decisions made by new mob boss Michael Corleone was common sense but flashing back on Vito Corleone's life was genius. The storyline to me could not have been better and Coppola and Puzo do a great job with it all the way.Like the first the cinematography was amazing but it had a slightly different tone to it. The first had more of a majestic, mythical look to it. In Part II you feel the modern times creeping in and the Corleones having to adjust to it. Part II has more of a corrupt and evil twist to it but I guess the end signifies that. The music obviously the same as the first was perfect and just fit so greatly with the rest of the movie.The first to movies of The Godfather series are really like the same movie. They are not the same though, they are actually very different but the greatness of them both and the continuation of the storyline from the first to the second really create a strong band between each other. To me it is only a sequel in that it was the second movie of a great series. No let downs, no disappointments just a continuation of of the greatness from the first one.

She did not play the stereotypical wife who always stands behind her husband but rather the woman with a mind of her own who is willing to go after what she feels she deserves. Robert Duvall again to me was the glue to the movie. Just having him in there kind of makes you feel safe. John Cazale also had more of an impact in here than in the first playing the half-witted brother always needing to be bailed out. A lot of these characters sound so familiar and stereotypical but in The Godfather Part II every character is played out with such extraordinary depth. Everyone from Talia Shire who gave a fine performance to Lee Strasberg all the way down to the kid who played young Vito Corleone were perfect. Part II seems to me to be more of a character study than the original.The directing once again is perfect. Francis Ford Coppola know or at least knew how to make a movie. The first to Godfather movie are done so precisely and perfectly that nothing really sticks out because they are so perfect throughout. Coppola just lets his actors play everything out as he should with type of cast he has here. Not to many movies can maintain such a consistent flow over 3 hours let alone even an hour and 45 minutes.The writing may not have been quite as good as the first in terms of quoting but the storyline was perfect. Seeing the decisions made by new mob boss Michael Corleone was common sense but flashing back on Vito Corleone's life was genius. The storyline to me could not have been better and Coppola and Puzo do a great job with it all the way.Like the first the cinematography was amazing but it had a slightly different tone to it. The first had more of a majestic, mythical look to it. In Part II you feel the modern times creeping in and the Corleones having to adjust to it. Part II has more of a corrupt and evil twist to it but I guess the end signifies that. The music obviously the same as the first was perfect and just fit so greatly with the rest of the movie.The first to movies of The Godfather series are really like the same movie. They are not the same though, they are actually very different but the greatness of them both and the continuation of the storyline from the first to the second really create a strong band between each other. To me it is only a sequel in that it was the second movie of a great series. No let downs, no disappointments just a continuation of of the greatness from the first one.

Just look at the IMDb rating and you'll see I'm not the only one who feels this way. To me it as good as the first.The acting may have been better than the acting in the original. Robert De Niro gave a perfect subtle performance as Vito Corleone. His portrayal was powerful and breathtaking. When I think De Niro I definitely do not think subtle and smooth but that is exactly what he was in here. It is definitely one of his top three performances in his career. The depth in his portrayal was able to justify the Vito Corleone that Marlon Brando portrayed in the first. Al Pacino gave a very strong performance playing Michael Corleone. In here we get to see more of the tough decisions that have to be made and the consequences of certain actions.

It's not just a matter of the producers controversially changing the nationality of the killer that makes Rising Sun such a appointment where Michael Crichton's novel weaved a multi-stranded web, turning issues into clues and bombarding the reader with information and clues to keep you guessing, director Philip Kaufman simplifies and makes it all patently predictable. Subplots are poorly handled, often either never followed through or simply forgotten, and you don't even care that much about who done it, or why.Of course, there is a difference between what makes a good book and what makes a good film, but before the rot set in Crichton didn't just write novels that read well, he wrote novels that play - turning one of his books into a film should be more a matter of editing than adapting. Yet, extraordinarily, the producers have either dropped or diluted everything that made the novel such a huge bestseller.Crichton's strength was always his ability to put over big issue in a pulp format, but while Kaufman does tidy up his typically messy ending, hedrops most of the issues, patronisingly soft-pedalling the novel's economic\/political debate, leaving just the pulp. It's rather like making The Third Man and ditching all that guff about cuckoo clocks and black marketeering, and getting rid of Orson for good measure. It may now be a gaijin who kills the girl, but it's Kaufman who kills the movie.Kaufman has shown he can take mainstream material and imbue it with a greater significance and still turn out a terrific picture with Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Right Stuff (and let's not forget, he was one of the creators of Indiana Jones), but perhaps he'd just spent too long making art movies in the interim. Here there's a snobbery to his direction, a contempt for his material that shines through in almost every frame - he thinks he's better than this, but still comes out looking like an amateur.Where Crichton's novel was not the racist tract many claimed at the time (Crichton's criticism wass aimed directly at America's short-sighted business\/political strategy), Kaufman's film comes perilously close to being just that. The xenophobia of the scene where Snipes sets some homeboys on the Japanese who are following him is an uncomfortable and tasteless exercise in ethnic stereotyping that doesn't belong in this movie.The most astonishing lapse is in the appallingly acted and staged scene where Snipes is interrogated by his superiors. While this provides the novel with an effective framing device, only a complete idiot would include the American PR man for the Japanese corporation implicated in the conspiracy and a muckraking reporter among those present. Kaufman does. Not only is he hopeless at staging action, but scenes such as the suicide are handled with an ineptitude bordering on the infantile while some of the sexual overtones are feeble beyond belief - hey, don't forget that close-up of the next door neighbour's crotch so we know what Wesley's thinking, Phil! If anything, the absolute stinker of an epilogue is even worse, coming on like the warm wrap-up to a 70s cop show and spelling out Connery and Carrere's relationship just in case we're too thick to work it out for ourselves.Much blame for this must attach itself to executive producer Sean Connery. Too many years of being denied his due as an actor and still, one suspects, trying to overcompensate for his years in Bondage have left him a sucker for a 'quality' director and a name writer, often with disastrous consequences (cf. A Good Man in Africa). Yet if Kaufman kills the movie, Connery gives it the kiss of life. Connery is never less than watchable, and he's certainly one of the few things worth watching here, whether barking Japanese in a Scottish accent or deliberately losing at golf. It's one of the best displays of pure star quality energising a moribund picture you're likely to see.Wesley Snipes is wildly miscast in a role that didn't just have Andy Garcia's name on it but his address and a photo of his wife and kids as well.

Supporting performances are dubious at best, with Mako, Carey-Hiroyuki Tagawa and Stan Egi faring best, countered by Ray Wise and Kevin Anderson, both even phonier than their roles.When Rising Sun concentrates on the plot mechanics, such as the manipulation of an incriminating recording of the murder, it's fine, but what should have been great is merely an average potboiler distinguished by Connery's presence.

Of course, all the 'classic' classical music, which most audiences will recognize from other films or sources, playing with moving objects is amazing. it is such wonderful film-making.The third section of the film, this section is really not all that different, but if you know what the film is about, it is the most important. This is actually a section where 'regular' people will not be asking what the heck is this about? or saying weird... This is where we get one of the most memorable characters in cinema history, the technology computer HAL-9000. This is truly a landmark of a character, one that gives you the creeps from the first time you see it. The way real humans interact with this computer is the whole point of the film. It is not just the writing that soars, but the amazing direction. The long shots, the steady camera, the heavy breathing done by Dave Bowen and Frank Poole, out in space is truly frightening. It is just amazing with the pace of the scenes that they are done with. All these scenes(just like throughout the film) are done very slowly and carefully. This truly emphasizes the meaning that they have, and their importance.The most beautiful scene on this film, and in the whole cinema history, is the Star Gate journey. This is definitely the most visually stunning scenes one will ever see. Yes, it is really minimal special effects, since all they probably use is colors, but it is just so amazing. I cannot just describe the beauty of this long scene. This scene is followed by the final section, which is in someplace very futuristic, one might imagine. The last 10 minutes of this film is the best endings I have ever seen, it is truly not an ending, but more of a revelation. The direction when the Black Monolith appears again, just wow. The cinematography is very well done for every single scene.Well, at the end of 2001 A Space Odyssey, all one can do is either hate it or love it. The ones who hate it are the ones who simply do not care to think or ask questions about great films. The ones who love it, really appreciate masterpieces like this. In my first viewing of this film, I loved it. In my second viewing, I might understand it more, but it does not lower in my mind of how great of a film it is. I truly think this is the best film ever made. I do not think anyone will ever be able to reach what this film reached. It is the most high achievement in technology, in writing, in pure film making. It is a film that everyone should at least see once. Of course, if you want to experience everything over and over again, keep reliving the journey...

The last 10 minutes of this film is the best endings I have ever seen, it is truly not an ending, but more of a revelation. The direction when the Black Monolith appears again, just wow. The cinematography is very well done for every single scene.Well, at the end of 2001 A Space Odyssey, all one can do is either hate it or love it. The ones who hate it are the ones who simply do not care to think or ask questions about great films. The ones who love it, really appreciate masterpieces like this.

I truly think this is the best film ever made. I do not think anyone will ever be able to reach what this film reached. It is the most high achievement in technology, in writing, in pure film making.

Yes, it is confusing, but knowing this time around what it was about, and what it meant was so relaxing.The way the film starts, with just darkness, and the amazing music score playing sets off the mood from the start. The landscapes seen on the first 15 minutes, with the apes, is so visually stunning. Knowing this is from 1968 is so amazing. I mean, I have never seen landscapes like this before. The way the film sets off the Black Monolith, the music, the motion of the apes, just the whole scene still stands as AMAZING and one of the best scenes of the film, also one of the best scenes I have ever seen. The next jump cut to space, the way the humans interact, the way the audience has to be on board and pay attention to the little details. Even if the film was trying to say nothing at all, it would still be a joy to watch, because it whisks you to another world, another place not in your imagination.

Shot-for-shot remakes are the most unnecessary and annoying, but others that stick too much to the formula that made the original film successful are also not to my liking. Paul Schrader's 1982 effort Cat People, the first film in Schrader's body of work as a director that was not written or co-written by him (at least not officially), is, regardless of whether or not it works for you, an interesting film. It is interesting in that it is its own film, entirely different to Jacques Tourneur's excellent 1942 film. It builds on and expands the mythology present in the 1942 version of the story, and that is in itself worthy of praise to me.Cat People features plenty of inexplicable shifts in tone and some pretty awful dialogue, but none of that could matter less in a film this wildly entertaining. The wacky mythology behind the film, the almost unbelievably sincere-feeling performances (which feel out of place, almost, in something as crazy and ludicrous as this film), the convincing and entertaining gore moments that pop up out of nowhere, and just about everything else make Cat People a must-see film, no matter how far-removed it is from the 1942 film.If possible, completely forget about Tourneur's film when watching this. It's not like you need the frame of reference, this is an entirely different sort of film. On a technical level both films are solid but I might have to give the advantage to Schrader's work as director. It's confident, stylish, creative, and helps the film move at a fast pace. The earlier film had a much better script, however.Cat People is a confusing film. It is tremendously entertaining, but it is also essentially a film with the mythology of an epic fantasy (an X-rated one) that is also a collection of successive contrivances to set up scenes featuring excessive nudity and gore. Schrader, by his own admission, was too stoned on one day of the filming to come out of his trailer. Let's just say that definitely shows in the end result here, not because Schrader's work is bad or sloppy, but because it really begs the question what on earth were they on? The answer here appears to be just marijuana. The music here is excellent. The early 80's synthesizer music is used very effectively here and David Bowie's contribution is among his best songs.Cat People is downright idiotic in places. It also obviously has no intention of being high art (although I'm sure many would argue it is), which means it is really just massively entertaining trash with a very sexy and pretty solid lead performance from Kinski. One thing you cannot accuse this film of being is boring. It simply isn't boring in the least, not for one second. If you're allergic to contrived instances of perverse sexuality and bizarre violence, don't bother with this film. If you aren't, Cat People is worth seeing, although I'm still not sure what to make of it.

There is little doubt about who is good and who is bad. No sympathy is wasted on anybody. The story begins with a shoot out and takes Wayne, the gunslinger, mumbingly half-conscious, to the house of some Quaker family, who nurse him back to health, introduce him to the purity of their daughter, Gail Russel, and finally convert him from his heathen ways.Wayne by this time was a propulsive force at Republic and this is A John Wayne Production. Wayne was in a position to hire James Edward Grant as the writer, and Grant in fact does a journeyman job on the script. He gives some decent lines to the characters, especially the Doc, Tom Powers. In the long run, though, it was probably a mistake to hire Grant. Wayne was so pleased with the dialog that he used Grant repeatedly for the rest of his career because, as Wayne once said, he knows how to write for me. Therein lies the problem. Grant kept writing the same laconic, masculine, flawless character for Wayne, long after movie goers had become more sophisticated. Typical Grant-written exchange. Sheriff You're a right tall man who looks like he could take care of his self. Wayne (Stand mute, expectant but expressionless.) Wayne would ride this character well into the 1970s with only minor variations, seemingly oblivious to the fact that his best roles tended towards ambiguity and complexity and challenge, as in Red River, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, and True Grit. Well, anyhoo. I said there were two exceptions to the generalization that this was just another routine Western. One exception is the fact that Wayne begins as a gun man and ends as a pacifist married to a Quaker. The usual trajectory goes in the other direction. The gun slinger tries to hang up his guns and become a farmer but instead is drawn back into mano a mano combat, as in Shane. True enough, there is the final shoot out that the audience is craving and the bad guys die by natural causes (bullets) but Wayne doesn't do the shooting. A Deus ex Machina does.The second exception is Gail Russel. She's the Quaker daughter who realizes, after watching the wounded Wayne toss around in bed and mutter about other girls, that she loves him. She does more than simply love him. She throws herself at his feet, even after she's learned that he rode into Rimrock and had a fling with the hoorah gals in the whorehouse there. Gail Russell, not much of an actress, is a porcelain doll, her pale selenian beauty combining vulnerability and sex appeal. (That vulnerability was all too real. She was found dead in her mid-30s surrounded by bottles of booze.) But -- never mind that. Okay, she's thoroughly neurotic and insecure. But, as Wayne might have said, I kinda LIKE that in a WUMMIN. Instead of throwing herself at the feet of somebody like Wayne, why couldn't she have thrown herself at the feet of somebody like me? Granted, I was never much with a gun but I can wield a pencil with the best of them. You should see my fast draw. (Fast draw with a pencil. Pun, execrable.) The DVD on which I watched this was plain awful. The images were blurred and the dialog indistinct. I was momentarily startled when somebody says the line And he had the GALL to ride to this house? Wayne doesn't really put much effort into the movie. Grant's lines come easily to him, as does his riding, after all those years in B Westerns.

Only three films into his career and Kubrick was already setting out his big theme &#150; society's need to break individuals that threaten it into manageable cogs in the machine, aided in its task by their own character flaws. He even has Kola Kwariani spell it out in so many words You have not yet learned that in this life you have to be like everyone else. The perfect mediocrity. No better, no worse. Individuality is a monster, and it must be strangled in its cradle to make our friends feel comfortable. You know, I often thought that the gangster and the artist are the same in the eyes of the masses. They're admired and hero-worshipped, but there is always present underlying wish to see them destroyed at the peak of their glory. The individual in question is Hayden's crook planning the biggest heist of the century with the help of a corrupt cop, a bartender and a racetrack cashier, bankrolled by Jay C. Flippen's moneyman, who clearly has a crush on him and goes straight to the bottle when he realises it's not mutual. The film's big gimmick at the time was the film backtracking to follow each member of the gang as they carry out their part in a vicious but ingenious and perfectly planned-to-the-second racetrack heist. But perfect plans, like computers or Marine recruits, have a tendency to break down due to a human error in the programme, and in this case the human error is Elisha Cook Jr., or more precisely his wife Marie Windsor in a double-crossing downmarket femme fatale role that would have been played by Gloria Graham in a bigger budgeted picture and who delivers a performance that seems the template for Joan Collins' entire career.

It's a wonderful thing, words. You would never imagine the important part they play in a bank robbery what to say to the hostages, how to treat them, what to discuss between partners, what to discuss between partners, what to tell the police or the FBI when they want to negotiate. Fortunately, Sonny (Al Pacino) is very good with words. He's so good that he manages to achieve a good relationship with the typical public that gathers in the streets every time there is a robbery. Sidney Lumet's Dog Day Afternoon is the tale of Sonny and Sal (John Cazale), two guys who enter a bank and plan to rob it quickly but end up staying the whole afternoon, and night. The movie is a harsh declaration against the role of the media in robberies, with cameras and reporters all over the place, not knowing exactly what they're doing but knowing they have to do something; against the role of the police, who say one thing and do another and keep their guns up while Sonny is constantly coming out of the bank with a white flag. Of course it all revolves around Pacinos's frenetic performance, in his first major role after The Godfather Part II. At one point he comes out of the bank and goes ballistic, demanding detective Moretti (Charles Durning) to tell the police officers to put their guns down, and screaming to the public about an event that happened in Attica. He didn't expect it, but he wins the public and becomes your 'freak show' of the day (as he would say); a kind of 'hero of the moment' everyone wants to talk to, which brings problems for the police to work properly.Did Sonny want this? We never know, but he uses it in his favor. We actually never know quite exactly what Sonny wants, and Sidney Lumet is kind enough to let us figure it out. The director focuses on the tension, establishing a clear difference of what's going on inside and outside the bank and then translates all this to Sonny's changes of mood. I'm dying here, he says to several people in different moments of the film; and we don't know if he's serious or if he's saying it to appear as a victim to the police.Because Sonny (and Sal, if you pay close attention) is not the guy who would enter a bank and rob it; that's something we can deduce because he knows things and he's, in general terms, kind and worrying. What Lumet does is putting us through a horrible experience as viewers, where we can never exactly decipher what the main character will do next and why he acts the way he acts and why people say something about him we can never get to see. It's frustrating that there's a human side of the movie and that we want to know all about it but we never get chance, unless we want to elaborate an own theory. I'm making a wild guess here, but how much could have Pierson known about this man in order to put it in his script? Probably nothing. And then we go back to the magic of words; because everything we can find out about Sonny, we do through his words. And his words are managing three expectations at the time what the hostages expect, what the police expect and what his partner Sal expects. It's marvelous to see how he manages it and how Lumet never loses the tension, and how among all of this unpredictable things, the film never stops creating unexpected moments.

Where it falls apart, however, is in an essential part of any movie...the leads, including the villain. Hitchcock usually was able to come up with interesting villains. Just think of James Mason, Robert Walker, Joseph Cotton, the never seen Rebecca, Paul Lukas, Ray Milland, Herbert Marshall or Claude Raines. In his best films, if he didn't have a charismatic villain he had such charismatic leads - Grant, Olivier, Donat, Bergman, Stewart, for example, that it didn't make much difference With Saboteur, we have as the male lead Robert Cummings, a pleasant actor, a fine light comedian but, in drama, just earnest, bland and conscientious. His partner here is Priscilla Lane, long forgotten but reasonably popular back then. She's a nice young woman, an adequate actor and not very interesting. Neither of them has any spark of self-irony and there's not bit of measurable sexual voltage. As a villain we have the always reliable Otto Kruger, mister smoothie himself. I've always enjoyed watching Kruger. He was predictable but completely professional. Put the three of them together and we have a film where we really don't care what happens to anybody.

In short order Barry is on the road to Springville, California, and the home of the rich and gracious Charles Tobin (Otto Kruger), then, after a perilous escape while wearing handcuffs, to a house in the woods. There he meets Pat Martin (Lane), who doesn't believe his story, and her blind uncle, who does. Then it's off to desolate Soda City (with Pat; she changed her mind), then to New York City and to a grand ball filled with traitors mixed in with the rich and patriotic.

History in this case is made by those who decide to disobey orders from bigot officers, in other words to abide by the real constitutional rules. The film is slightly romantic in a way when it shows how this Black man is really doing more than his share of good and courageous acts and is often side-tracked and rejected, even for a medal he actually deserves that is yet given to some other white diver. Effective in its emotionality but yet only emphasizing the human side of things and not the political back-side of them.

Sounds like a bad film? Well, it might have been, if directed by anyone else than Werner Herzog, the director of magnificent psychological-historical film Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes (1972). Herzog considered F. W. Murnau's 1922 silent film Nosferatu, an unofficial silent adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula, to be the most important film ever made in Germany and wanted to do his own version of it. This film, Nosferatu Phantom der Nacht (1979), is in many ways more of a new version of Murnau's original silent classic, instead of Stoker's novel. However, unlike in original Nosferatu, this film does keep the original names of the characters. In the title role Herzog hired his most beloved enemy; Klaus Kinski, with whom Herzog had worked in Aguirre.The story is mainly a replay of the original Nosferatu. In 1830's Germany, Jonathan Harker (Bruno Ganz) receives an important job from his eccentric boss Renfield (Roland Topor) and travels to Transylvania to meet a strange noble man Graf Dracula (Klaus Kinski). Meanwhile back in Germany, Jonathan's wife Lucy (Isabelle Adjani) feels the presence of an approaching death. In many places this film follows Murnau's original so accurately, that some viewers have wondered if the whole film should have been left unmade. However, while the original Nosferatu stands as a grandfather of all vampire films, Herzog's version is an almost poetic movie of death. It is very peacefully moving film, purposely avoiding any great horror scenes and thunderous music that makes adrenaline run.So if you're looking for a film with lots of blood, gore, sexy vampires and nudity, look from somewhere else. This is a film for those who can sit watching beautiful sceneries and listen to a soft music. The beautiful shots of Amsterdam's old town, as well as of Carpathian Mountains, gives the film a feeling of an old world, almost a dream like quality. This is only strengthen by Popol Vuh's music, that can change from folk-like music to an eerie ghost music.Like in most of their collaborations, while half of the movie's credits go to Herzog, the other half goes to the actor Klaus Kinski (who had appeared in Jess Franco's El Conde Dracula as Renfield). Kinski's portrayal of Dracula is not the usual charismatic European gentleman with a darker side in him. Wearing a very same looking make-up as Max Schreck did in original Nosferatu, this Dracula is a monstrous looking demon who couldn't seduce a woman no matter what. However, Kinski doesn't play him as a monster, but as a tired creature, wary of eternal life and eternal loneliness. He longs to have things humans take granted, but he can only take them by force for no one will give them to him. Kinski is the most unfaithful Dracula to Bram Stoker's novel, but also makes an interesting character of him. Adjani and Ganz make good supporting roles also, but can't help but being overshadowed by Kinski.Werner Herzog's version of Nosferatu is not for every ones liking, but it is a beautifully shot film of death and terror. The actual horror is born from Lucy's desperation and determination to stop the vampire before it's too late and save what little there is left of her peaceful life. This is a film for those who have enjoyed other works of Herzog or Carl Dreyer's 1931 film Vampyr, which is closest vampire film to this one.

In 1830's Germany, Jonathan Harker (Bruno Ganz) receives an important job from his eccentric boss Renfield (Roland Topor) and travels to Transylvania to meet a strange noble man Graf Dracula (Klaus Kinski). Meanwhile back in Germany, Jonathan's wife Lucy (Isabelle Adjani) feels the presence of an approaching death. In many places this film follows Murnau's original so accurately, that some viewers have wondered if the whole film should have been left unmade. However, while the original Nosferatu stands as a grandfather of all vampire films, Herzog's version is an almost poetic movie of death. It is very peacefully moving film, purposely avoiding any great horror scenes and thunderous music that makes adrenaline run.So if you're looking for a film with lots of blood, gore, sexy vampires and nudity, look from somewhere else. This is a film for those who can sit watching beautiful sceneries and listen to a soft music. The beautiful shots of Amsterdam's old town, as well as of Carpathian Mountains, gives the film a feeling of an old world, almost a dream like quality. This is only strengthen by Popol Vuh's music, that can change from folk-like music to an eerie ghost music.Like in most of their collaborations, while half of the movie's credits go to Herzog, the other half goes to the actor Klaus Kinski (who had appeared in Jess Franco's El Conde Dracula as Renfield). Kinski's portrayal of Dracula is not the usual charismatic European gentleman with a darker side in him. Wearing a very same looking make-up as Max Schreck did in original Nosferatu, this Dracula is a monstrous looking demon who couldn't seduce a woman no matter what. However, Kinski doesn't play him as a monster, but as a tired creature, wary of eternal life and eternal loneliness. He longs to have things humans take granted, but he can only take them by force for no one will give them to him. Kinski is the most unfaithful Dracula to Bram Stoker's novel, but also makes an interesting character of him. Adjani and Ganz make good supporting roles also, but can't help but being overshadowed by Kinski.Werner Herzog's version of Nosferatu is not for every ones liking, but it is a beautifully shot film of death and terror. The actual horror is born from Lucy's desperation and determination to stop the vampire before it's too late and save what little there is left of her peaceful life. This is a film for those who have enjoyed other works of Herzog or Carl Dreyer's 1931 film Vampyr, which is closest vampire film to this one.

Sounds like a bad film? Well, it might have been, if directed by anyone else than Werner Herzog, the director of magnificent psychological-historical film Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes (1972). Herzog considered F. W. Murnau's 1922 silent film Nosferatu, an unofficial silent adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula, to be the most important film ever made in Germany and wanted to do his own version of it. This film, Nosferatu Phantom der Nacht (1979), is in many ways more of a new version of Murnau's original silent classic, instead of Stoker's novel.
