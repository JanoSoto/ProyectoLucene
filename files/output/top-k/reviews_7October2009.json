[{"date":"7 October 2009","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" John Carpenter's Vampires is the latest movie I watched as part of my reviewing of horror and Halloween-themed shows this October. It's also the worst so far. This movie, which is about a vampire slayer named Crow (James Woods), came out in 1998- right about when a TV show called Buffy the Vampire Slayer was on the air. Skimming through some of the comments, I haven't seen anyone else talking about this, but to me the differences are obvious. Although both are about vampire slaying, this movie is the anti-Buffy in numerous ways. And it makes the movie look fairly ugly.If you think the vampires in Buffy are too tame, and that the amount of violence that can be put on TV is too light, then you'll probably love this movie and hate Buffy. That's fine for you. Personally, though, I happen to believe in what I was taught in twelfth grade English, that less is more. Besides, I've never heard of vampires who fight like this- tearing apart and decapitating people with a single swipe of their claws. True, the vampire who does this, Valek, is supposed to be the ultimate super-strong vampire. It's just too bad they couldn't decide on how strong he is- when he's killing Crow's team he's pumped full of bullets and isn't moved by them; but when he chases after the truck a gunshot knocks him off.But the big way in which this movie is the anti-Buffy is in its view of women. I'm male but a liberal, and I liked how Buffy empowered women, made them the heroes for once, and gave them independence, smarts and strength. In contrast, in this movie the main female character is a prostitute called Katrina. She's bitten by Valek early on, almost sounding like she was having an orgasm while he fed off her. She gradually turns into a vampire, but Crow and his sidekick Montoya keep her alive in hope that she can be used to find Valek. The way she's treated by the men is not respectful. She's tied to the bed naked, for one thing. Now, as is evident from reading my other reviews, I love female nudity in movies. But here even I was wondering why she was naked. Montoya hits her, which may be forgivable in the heat of the moment, but he doesn't regret it Who cares? he asks. Later Crow also turns rough with her (and it's Montoya who ironically objects). I'll grant you, Crow's rough with everyone- too rough to be likable- but even elementary school bullies know you're not supposed to hit a girl. At any rate, Katrina is a powerless pawn, a worthless hooker, there are no heroines, and James Woods is who we're supposed to be rooting for.What's good about this? Again, it'll appeal to people who love gore, its vampires aren't fooling around. It may provide a scare (although a better movie can scare you with less graphic violence) and sometimes its presentation of vampires is valid. Vampires, Crow tells us, are not romantic. That's true to the original legend. I just wish I could have seen this less romantic version of vampires in the original Nosferatu. 4.5\/10 Happy Halloween.

It begins in a dream-like desert of long ago with a woman about to be sacrificed to a black leopard. Before this leopard kills her, he seems to make love to her on the tree. We then flash forward to present time as we see Irena Gallier (Nastassia Kinski) meet her brother Paul (Malcolm McDowell). He lives with an African-American woman named Female (Ruby Dee). When Paul temporarily disappears, Irena goes to the New Orleans Zoo (actually called Audubon Zoo) where she meets head Oliver Yates (John Heard) and his associate Alice Perrin (Annette O'Toole). I'll stop there and just say while some scenes seem a bit pretentious (like the POV of Irena when she's a leopard) and the film may be a little long, I enjoyed this version of Cat People almost as much as the original one and appreciated many of the twists and changes made as well as some similarities (like Irena sketching the leopard, a woman saying my sister to her in her native tongue, and the pool scene with Alice). In fact, writer Alan Ormsby-with some uncredited contributions from Schrader-expands on DeWitt Bodeen's previous take with modern sensibilities and Southern Louisianaian flavor. Other acting turns I enjoyed include Ed Begley, Jr.'s role as Joe Creigh who provided come comic relief before his tragic scene and N. O. native John Larroquette's cameo as Bronte Judson. And the score by Giorgio Moroder is hauntingly pulsating. In summation, while this version of Cat People can get a little out of hand, it's still quite entertaining in its own part that I quite highly recommend it.

It has a great story and a really creepy atmosphere. The acting is great and the special effects can not be looked down on.The story is simple, a cargo ship picks up an transmission of alien origin, they land on a planet and find a ship. The ship appears to have been attacked and there a bunch of eggs in the cargo hold or whatever it is. One of the crew; Kane(John Hurt) get's attacked by a thing in the egg that grabs his face. And that's when the nightmare starts. Soon there an vicious alien on board and it's all about survival. Now I'll stop right here.What I liked about he movie was especially the acting, believable and it truly gave the movie it's dark tone. I liked the start of the movie when they found the alien spacecraft, and John Hurt's character got infected by the Alien. But that's where the fun ended slightly for me. From that point on it had some really boring scenes. The scene where Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) went to find the cat, was way to long and killed the suspense. We all knew he where gonna die, and prolonging it was just annoying. The flickering lights in the end was annoying and again ruined the suspense. When you can't see either the main character or the alien, well then it's suddenly nothing scary to see anymore.Still there where many good scenes in the last part of the movie (SPOILER alert) the whole robot ash thing was a really clever and unpredictable part. It came as a shock and the effects where great. But just to complain a little more, why did the ship explode three times? In conclusion, once again, I did not hate this movie, I just feel there where things that could have been avoided. but I like the fact that this film has been an inspiration to many other filmmakers in it's following years. If you like this film I recommend John Carpenter' sthe Thing.My verdict for this film is 7\/10, I was originally considering giving it a 6, but considering the film's great impact i must give it one star more.

While the plot is often incomprehensible, and the happenings are rarely clearly defined as true events or the product of a nightmare, the sum total of Phantasm is an unforgettable experience that very few films in the genre come close to rivaling.Angus Scrimm's unnamed Tall Man is one of the most iconic figures in horror history, and his imposing presence is enough to generate most of the film's scares on its own. Of course, he gets plenty of help from a horde of hooded dwarfs and a mysterious flying sphere that burrows into the forehead of its unsuspecting victims and spews out their blood and brains like a guignol geyser. If that's not enough, the fact that the bulk of the film is set in a sprawling mausoleum with seemingly endless marble corridors, which houses a gateway to another world no less, should be sufficient for Coscarelli to tap into some source of dread within you.Fans of Dario Argento should notice some obvious admiration on the part of Coscarelli, particularly in some of the camera-work and neo-psychedelic imagery. However, while Coscarelli takes obvious cues from the godfather of giallo, Phantasm's auteur uses these tools for devices entirely his own. Indeed, this film's highly-stylized approach and disorienting cuts seem to invite the viewer to be confused. But this confusion is an unsettling one, and it's more likely that Coscarelli was aiming to make this dark head-trip as jarring and incoherent as it often is. While you may not understand exactly what's going on at any given moment, the film sustains its morbid atmosphere so effectively that you won't be able to take your eyes off of the train wreck.The understated score is one of the best of all time, channeling the minimalism of John Carpenter's superlative music in Halloween through a filter of the avant-garde progressive rock favored by Goblin, Dario Argento's go-to music source. Musical score is a sometimes-overlooked component in many films, but in the horror genre especially, the sounds that frame the images are often as important to the foreboding tone as the visceral horror that accompanies them. You won't find better examples than in this film, where a seemingly benign shot like The Tall Man walking down the street becomes a vortex of grim foreshadowing, indelibly augmented by the music that follows him.The film utilizes very little splatter to serve the horror, but the few bits here are truly memorable and unsettling, such as the afore-mentioned gore-geyser. However, somehow the sight of Scrimm's egg-yolk-yellow blood is far more effective than gallons of the red sauce, so the film manages its fair share of wet-work despite the obvious emphasis on mood and suspense over slice and dice.In keeping with its experimental leanings, it's fitting that Phantasm doesn't come to a logical conclusion, and in many ways, the appearance of the Tall Man at the film's denouement with his infamous bellowed Boy! leads us to believe that this movie ends somewhere in the middle of the story rather than the finale. With so many intriguing ideas here ripe for exploration, it's actually rather strange that Phantasm only spawned three sequels. I must admit, I only saw two of those, and I barely remember them at this point, but I'm fairly certain I don't have answers to all the questions that arose while I revisited this classic original.Perhaps that's the key to Phantasm's chilling aftermath it introduces us to a series of unexplained supernatural occurrences and forces us to accept them without the levity of understanding. The film itself is only a snapshot of the greater horror, so when we invest our imaginations in the happenings at Morningside Cemetery, we have to conclude that there are more malevolent evils at play there than what we have been privy to through the eyes of our characters.Whether or not you will be satisfied by the tantalizing glimpse the film provides, there is no denying the pure power of the film's unique and obtuse approach to horror. There has never been another film like Phantasm, before or since, and for that reason alone it is mandatory viewing for anyone who considers themselves even a casual connoisseur of horror cinema.If you need a reason other than that, I'll offer you a simple one this movie is freaking awesome.

There has never been another film like Phantasm, before or since, and for that reason alone it is mandatory viewing for anyone who considers themselves even a casual connoisseur of horror cinema.If you need a reason other than that, I'll offer you a simple one this movie is freaking awesome.

Basically Pete Sandich (Richard Dreyfuss) is a daredevil aerial forest firefighter, with best pal Al Yackey (John Goodman), with true love Dorinda Durston (Holly Hunter) by his side, as radio controller. He takes a lot of risks, and one day a risk doesn't pay off and he is killed, but he finds himself coming back an an invisible ghost. He cannot be seen or heard, and he has to watch as Dorinda and his successor Ted Baker (Brad Johnson) start falling for each other. His spirit guide (or whatever she is) Hap (Audrey Hepburn, in her last screen role) tells him that he will be freed and able to go when he allows himself to let her go and say goodbye, so when he eventually does, all the women will probably want their handkerchiefs. Also starring Roberts Blossom as Dave, Keith David as Powerhouse, Marg Helgenberger as Rachel and Brian Haley as Alex. I have to say the concept of this film reminded me of Ghost, which was made a year after this, but this film doesn't quite have the same quality for story-telling. But the performances by Dreyfuss, Hunter, and a scene-stealing Goodman (that dance scene being a highlight) are all good, so it's not bad. Worth watching!

Basically Natasha 'Nat' Binder (Yancy Butler) is looking for her missing father Douglas (Chuck Pfarrer) in New Orleans, Louisiana. After arriving she finds unemployed hard man Chance Boudreaux (Jean-Claude Van Damme), who she hires both to help and protect her, but then they find out that the police find the father's body, he was murdered by an organisation taking advantage of a police strike. Evil mercenary Emil Fouchon (Lance Henriksen) and his partner Pik Van Cleef (The Mummy's Arnold Vosloo) learn about them searching for the father they killed, and soon enough they and their gang of mercenaries are hunting down hard target Boudreaux and Nat. Also starring Wilford Brimley as Uncle Douvee, Kasi Lemmons as Det. Marie Mitchell, Robert Apisa as Mr. Lopacki and Ted Raimi, Sam's brother as Man on the Street. Van Damme is pretty alright as the leading action, I had seen him previously in Sudden Death and Universal Soldier, I wouldn't have guessed he was supposedly gay! Anyway, Henriksen and Vosloo make a great villain duo, and there are some good small exciting explosive moments, so it is an action thriller that can be enjoyed. Worth watching!

Set in the future, 1997, New York City was turned into a maximum security prison for criminals to be for life, and any way or out of the city is mined and walled. On his way to a conference, the President (Donald Pleasence) has Air Force One crash, forcing him to eject, landing in a New York building. Police Force Commissioner Bob Hauk (For a Few Dollars More's Lee Van Cleef) knows that one-eyed prisoner Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) is the only man capable of bringing the President out alive. To make sure he does actually do the job, Plissken has explosive devices put into him that will detonate in 24 hours, and obviously when the job is done he will be saved and get freedom. So begins a search for the President, with the help of characters like Cabbie (Ernest Borgnine), Maggie (Adrienne Barbeau), and eventually Brain (Harry Dean Stanton). They do eventually find the President, being held hostage by ruthless warlord The Duke (Isaac Hayes), it is just a question of will Plissken either get the President out before his time is up, or will he try to escape from New York. It may not be a fast moving story, but it does have some eye-catching stuff, like the special effects and its slick dark tone, it is an action thriller to be liked. Good!
