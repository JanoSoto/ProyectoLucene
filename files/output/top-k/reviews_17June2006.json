It tries hard to give the audience a graceful combination of physical humor, sexual slap-stick, classic Hollywood references, and X-treme sport clips, but in the end it face plants hard into the cinematic pavement. While I will not be generous to this film, I will begin this review by mentioning how proud I am of Out Cold. Again, this was nowhere near a good film, but as a person that watches films on a consistent basis, I saw Out Cold as a film that tried really hard to be humorous, original, and creative, but just failed miserably. One must give credit to those films that fail while trying, because so many films today just, honestly, fail to try. Unoriginality seems to be a common theme among these tween films, as big boobs, beer drinking, and cliché characters invade the screen more often than humorous dialogue that invades your mind and into modern culture. Out Cold aims towards a general audience that I despise. That audience is one that will pay top dollar for stupid humor that demonstrates no talent and a considerable lack of creativity. Why do we, as audience members, do that? Is it that difficult for us to laugh at intelligent humor? While Out Cold did not begin the trend in Hollywood, it did contribute to it, and thus continuing films like Date Movie, American Wedding, and Dude, Where's My Car to plague our theaters.I think I have spoken enough about my personal belief on why this film was a wart on the back of Hollywood, so let's look at actual reasons why this film tried and failed. I have to get this first one out in the open. Why, painfully I ask this question, did the filmmakers see the quality in combining tween humor, snowboarding, and Casablanca together in one film? The first two matched, but the last was just pure rubbish. Outside of an adult audience, not many children or teens would catch the classic Hollywood film reference, thus completely ruining the remains of a dying film genre. Now, when the audience of Out Cold actually connect Casablanca to Out Cold, they will say lines like This movie is just like Out Cold. This makes me so angry. If parents would raise their children correctly in film most will say, Out Cold took quite a bit from Casablanca, instead of the other way around. Casablanca needs to come first. With that said, our biggest pitfall to this film was the characters. Were there any? Great question! I didn't see any. Instead, I saw actors reacting to certain situations. There were no definitions to anyone. Sure, one could argue that there were some characters with Pig Pen and Inga, but when I see these moments, I see clichés, not characters. Anyone can play a druggie, stoner, big-breasted woman, town idiot, and so forth, but it is how that actor chooses to redefine that overused character that really sets a film apart from the rest. Nothing of the sort happened here. Jason London was horrid as the title character, and his supposed girlfriend was as bland as Illinois. Jason's friends were obnoxiously unexciting and Lee Majors walked on set, said his lines, and walked off. Again, there was nothing of value. Nobody went beyond the lines on their script, which ultimately hurt the overall viewing experience of this film.If I were to pick one element that kept this film from completely drowning would be the use of David Koechner, of whom I cannot help but laugh at whenever he opens his mouth. He is the prime example of what I was hoping the direction would be for these filmmakers. He was a unique character for Bull Mountain and thus created some of the better lines for the film, if only the rest of the cast would have taken his lead. Yet, I do not blame the cast for it all, the filmmakers (the Malloy brothers) had to make the underlying decision to either make another tween film, or sharpen the humor and aim towards a smarter audience. As you may or may not have noticed, they went with the latter. The entire King of the Mountain bit was horrendous, not because of the storyline element, but the fact that everyone's beer was flying, nobody recognized anyone, and only the characters we were familiar with were winners. Just disrespectful to the rest of those that inhabits Bull Mountain. The funniest bit that I think the Malloys were able to pull off were the brotherly pranks pulled when one was too drunk. The first one with the polar bear was not funny (rather juvenile), but the one with the car continues to put a smile on my face. It was this type of humor that I was expecting the entire film, but overall continued to keep falling short.Overall, Out Cold felt like your last pick to be your date for prom. Sure, there were some elements that were decent enough to smile at, but most of the time you were embarrassed to be seen with her in public. I am tired of this tween genre of film, and while I know that due to an increasing decline in intelligence in our theaters we will only continue to see more of this type of movie, I am still tired of it. It is as if most directors are just using the cut & paste feature on their editing machines bringing us the same jokes that have been told once with success, but over time, they just become boring. Again, I will say that of most of the films in this genre, Out Cold did try a bit harder to be beyond the mold, but in the end it was nothing spectacular.Grade ** out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"17 June 2006","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Out Cold tries hard to capture the tween audiences without fully using the infamous raunch button to be successful.

Then, I watched it again about six months later and got disgusted with some of it. Maybe I should have waited another 40 years between viewings! (Only kidding)THE GOOD - Well, I can start with the fine acting and interesting characters, led by Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch, one of the more noble characters ever put on screen. He is single father taking care of two adolescents and is a strong moral man who stands for all that is right. The main theme of the movie is racism, and I'm sure this much bigger impact 44 years ago than today. It wasn't long after this that the U.S. was embroiled in numerous race riots. It was a tumultuous decade, to say the least. There also is a tiny sub-plot in this story which involves another kind of bias, one against the mentally-ill or simply against pre-conceived notions we might have of people who are different from us.Not only is Peck outstanding, but kudos to the kids in here, too, beginning with Mary Badham as young Scout. She only made one other movie and never acted as an adult. She's a great kid in here and winsome in a tomboy-ish way. Her brother Jem (Philip Alvord) also is good, and has a wonderful scene in front of the courthouse protecting his dad against a mob. New-found friend Dill Harris (John Megna) has a much shorter role but completes the trio of youngsters who all prove to be capable actors. Kim Stanley narrates the film as grownup Scout looking back on those days. Brock Peters is good as the black man accused of something he didn't do, and it was interesting to see Robert Duvall in, I believe, his first movie role. He had done TV for a couple of years prior to this film. His role, however, was right at the end of the film and he said very little, if anything, as the misunderstood Boo Radley. This is a very nicely photographed film with great lighting in here. The whole thing was shot on a Hollywood set. It looks super on the latest special-edition two-disc DVD. I enjoy watching the great black-and-white images in here but then again, it's easier to produce perfect lighting like this rather than going on actual location and adjusting to the conditions. Still, it's a visual treat.BAD - In the filmmakers' zeal to show the ugliness of racism they were insultingly biased in the courtroom finale and unrealistic in portraying the lead male racist. Being fair and balanced was not something shown in coverage of the trial since the most dramatic parts - the final summations - are wonderfully and powerfully presented by defense attorney Finch but we never hear the prosecution summation! What happened to that speech? We only hear one side! At least give us viewers credit for having enough common sense to know what's right after we hear both sides. The film world rarely treats the moviegoers intelligently, preferring to hit us over the heads with their agendas instead. And, showing this redneck Bob Ewell (James Anderson) going out all alone and ranting and raving in front of house full of blacks late at night is ridiculous. Nobody, but nobody is that stupid white, black or any color. But, once again, the filmmakers do everything they can to manipulate their audience and this film is extremely manipulative. OVERALL - Nonetheless, despite the obvious bias it's still a good, powerful story with great moral lessons. It also gives us something we don't see much in modern movies an ideal father figure, not just in the way he handles his kids but all adults, too. You can't find a much better role model. I'd like to see more of this types of people on film.

Then, I watched it again about six months later and got disgusted with some of it. Maybe I should have waited another 40 years between viewings! (Only kidding)THE GOOD - Well, I can start with the fine acting and interesting characters, led by Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch, one of the more noble characters ever put on screen. He is single father taking care of two adolescents and is a strong moral man who stands for all that is right. The main theme of the movie is racism, and I'm sure this much bigger impact 44 years ago than today. It wasn't long after this that the U.S. was embroiled in numerous race riots. It was a tumultuous decade, to say the least. There also is a tiny sub-plot in this story which involves another kind of bias, one against the mentally-ill or simply against pre-conceived notions we might have of people who are different from us.Not only is Peck outstanding, but kudos to the kids in here, too, beginning with Mary Badham as young Scout. She only made one other movie and never acted as an adult. She's a great kid in here and winsome in a tomboy-ish way. Her brother Jem (Philip Alvord) also is good, and has a wonderful scene in front of the courthouse protecting his dad against a mob. New-found friend Dill Harris (John Megna) has a much shorter role but completes the trio of youngsters who all prove to be capable actors. Kim Stanley narrates the film as grownup Scout looking back on those days. Brock Peters is good as the black man accused of something he didn't do, and it was interesting to see Robert Duvall in, I believe, his first movie role. He had done TV for a couple of years prior to this film. His role, however, was right at the end of the film and he said very little, if anything, as the misunderstood Boo Radley. This is a very nicely photographed film with great lighting in here. The whole thing was shot on a Hollywood set. It looks super on the latest special-edition two-disc DVD. I enjoy watching the great black-and-white images in here but then again, it's easier to produce perfect lighting like this rather than going on actual location and adjusting to the conditions. Still, it's a visual treat.BAD - In the filmmakers' zeal to show the ugliness of racism they were insultingly biased in the courtroom finale and unrealistic in portraying the lead male racist. Being fair and balanced was not something shown in coverage of the trial since the most dramatic parts - the final summations - are wonderfully and powerfully presented by defense attorney Finch but we never hear the prosecution summation!

Even when its focus is the investigation of a soldier's death by hazing at a Guantanamo military facility, and even when it lets the audience in on that the proper authorities knew more than they were letting in on, it's a story that is much too explicit, much too spelled out in capital letters to garner a sufficient amount of suspense. Where Christie's script for WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION didn't allow anyone to see its denouement, making the final sequence a smash ending for a pretty tense movie, Sorkin's script is, while good, tight, and filled with the requisite drama, too pat. It does manage to draw the audience in -- it did so when I saw it in theatres in Dominican Republic -- but solely on the strength of the performers, including Tom Cruise, who wasn't yet on his power trips to Mars and beyond and wigging out on Oprah. I did appreciate that the script did not give into the more soapy elements of romance, a thing that would have been a pre-requisite in any courtroom drama in the Forties and Fifties, even if the military was the background setting. Demi Moore's character, as such, is written as an efficient woman, we know nothing more about her, and that is fine. If the role would have been conceived as a man in the initial drafts it might as well stayed that way; her presence, while in gender a woman, is extremely masculine, but not overpowering. Call her a strong woman, like many women working in either the militia or law enforcement divisions. There are many like her. I know several.Now, the problem lies in the casting of Jack Nicholson. While he's a fantastic actor, his presence early in the movie alone already spells the movie's climax. Unlike his uncredited cameo in the movie BROADCAST NEWS, his character here is a force to be reckoned with, and because this is a movie about an investigation that has to, by the laws of simple storytelling, produce a disclosure of information and thus vindicate Lt. William Santiago from his tragic death, it's inevitable that Nicholson will be called to testify in court. It's then when the movie becomes a one-track road leading to this one moment that asks what will happen when Nicholson takes the stand. What is surprising is how ferociously he wigs out, and so convincingly. So where there is this rising anticipation of a moment where these two men will collide, when it actually happens, while it was to be expected, it still manages to instill a sense of awe. Not because of its dramatic power -- it has it in droves -- but because of the performances. Of the three main actors, Nicholson is the one with the least screen time but the one audiences remember, particularly for his line You can't handle the truth! Not surprisingly this would be the only acting nod the Academy would give A FEW GOOD MEN, and as an end-note, this is also one of the few movies released in the recent years to feature the words The end at the beginning of the end credits.

I thought I had seen bad movies before this one, but this takes the prize with flying colors. You couldn't pay me any amount of money to waste another two hours of my life on this piece of garbage. However, if you like stereotypical characters, an unrealistic story, and a plot so god-awful that the every copy of the script should be burned in a giant fire, this is the perfect movie for you.One of the first, most obvious, and most painful issues with this movie are the characters. They are all completely stereotyped. There is the 'everyone else in the world owes me a personal favor' prep, the 'poor me, I'm just the best at sports' jock, the 'part of every academic club at the school' geek, the 'who really knows what my problem is' weirdo, and the 'I'm so bad because I have such a terrible life' criminal. I am in high school right now. I think that, when people look back at high school when they are thirty or whatever, they see things how they want to, and so they categorize the people they knew. They think that each person is one way, and nothing else. WRONG. You don't have to be just one thing, in one group of people. People can't always be placed in neat little categories, GET OVER IT. The only realistic character is the prep, who only cares about herself and what the world can do for her. I know people exactly like her, but thats it. People need to be a little more realistic.The story, of course, doesn't help at all. One example a gun goes off in Brian's locker so he gets Saturday detention? Really. More like suspension, and only that because he probably never did anything else. But one Saturday detention? Right, and I just saw a flying hippo enter a bar where it sings every week.And last, but certainly not least, is the plot. This movie is what I like to call a 'prep movie'. Translation shallow, useless, and the preps win. You either change everything about yourself to become another brainless zombie prep, or you loose. You die. End of story.

I had never heard of that movie and since I am quite fond of musicals, I gave it a try.Now, I dearly love my host-father, but I really hate this movie. I have seen it twice so far, once with him to get to know it and once a few months ago when it was shown on German TV for the first time (!!). But the second time I only watched it to play Mystery Science Theater 3000 with some of my friends.The reason why this movie had never been shown on German TV before was because the German language track had been lost for many years and was only rediscovered by accident a while ago. But why did nobody in the German speaking region care to find the language track of this much beloved movie earlier? The main reason is that this movie, though it may have been successful in most parts of the world, was not so in Germany, Austria or Switzerland - and for good reason.Everything in this movie is just sooooooooooooooo terrible cliché! The cinematography, the dresses, the way everybody behaves.... ugh! If this is the way Americans look at Austria (or Germany and Switzerland, since I have the feeling that many do not really know the differences between these countries) than we really have a lot to do to correct this picture.But there is another reason, why I don't like this movie. It is really insulting to one's intelligence. The whole thing feels like it was made for kids (and done badly), everybody is virtuous, smiling all the time, bouncing around happily running through the countryside just enjoying being alive. Above all they sing songs that could come out of Sesame Street. Actually I was expecting a song that teaches you how to count to ten to pop up any minute. Come on! This is not beautiful, it is just plain dumb!There was a German oder Austrian movie made in the fifties called Die Trapp Familie and following its success, a sequel was produced later about their life in the US. The fifties in the history of German movies were notorious for the tacky Heimatfilme (homeland movies) that were produced in this era portraying Germany and Austria as happy beautiful places where happy people lived who did nothing but smile and enjoy the countryside all day long. Die Trapp Familie was one of these bad movies, but even this movie did not come close to the abomination that is The Sound of Music. At least the former had some level, albeit small, of realism.I like Julie Andrews as an actress and singer, but this movie was not only not saved by her performance, but made even worse. I hope they put the German language track back on the dusty shelf where they found it and never show this movie in Germany again.

But the second time I only watched it to play Mystery Science Theater 3000 with some of my friends.The reason why this movie had never been shown on German TV before was because the German language track had been lost for many years and was only rediscovered by accident a while ago. But why did nobody in the German speaking region care to find the language track of this much beloved movie earlier? The main reason is that this movie, though it may have been successful in most parts of the world, was not so in Germany, Austria or Switzerland - and for good reason.Everything in this movie is just sooooooooooooooo terrible cliché! The cinematography, the dresses, the way everybody behaves.... ugh! If this is the way Americans look at Austria (or Germany and Switzerland, since I have the feeling that many do not really know the differences between these countries) than we really have a lot to do to correct this picture.But there is another reason, why I don't like this movie. It is really insulting to one's intelligence. The whole thing feels like it was made for kids (and done badly), everybody is virtuous, smiling all the time, bouncing around happily running through the countryside just enjoying being alive. Above all they sing songs that could come out of Sesame Street. Actually I was expecting a song that teaches you how to count to ten to pop up any minute. Come on! This is not beautiful, it is just plain dumb!There was a German oder Austrian movie made in the fifties called Die Trapp Familie and following its success, a sequel was produced later about their life in the US. The fifties in the history of German movies were notorious for the tacky Heimatfilme (homeland movies) that were produced in this era portraying Germany and Austria as happy beautiful places where happy people lived who did nothing but smile and enjoy the countryside all day long. Die Trapp Familie was one of these bad movies, but even this movie did not come close to the abomination that is The Sound of Music. At least the former had some level, albeit small, of realism.I like Julie Andrews as an actress and singer, but this movie was not only not saved by her performance, but made even worse. I hope they put the German language track back on the dusty shelf where they found it and never show this movie in Germany again.

It just kind of peters out, like Lawrence's desert campaign.The acting is superb with the possible exception of Anthony Quinn, who overacts. Two of the all-time greats - Alec Guiness and Omar Sharif - also added life to this monumental epic story. This was O'Toole's first role, too, and probably his most famous and some think his best. After this film and for a short period afterwords, O'Toole was looked upon as the premier actor in the business.For a film this long and with such little action, it's amazing it entertains as well as it does. For those who need some pretty women to aid in the story, forget it in fact, there are NO women that I can remember. It gets by with the cinematography, O'Toole intense acting portraying a real-life vain, courageous, stubborn and obsessed Englishman trying to unite the Arabs to fight the Turks.Another very memorable and impressive aspect of this movie was the soundtrack.

And seeing it as a young kid, i have to admit the opening scene scared the crap out of me. So when i saw this movie on the shelf in the video store a few months ago, they had just re-released it on DVD due to the remake being in theaters at the time i quickly picked it up. When i brought it home i began to watch it, and i have to admit the opening scene, while not as scary as i remember, still holds up as being a truly terrifying moment in the film. Now i wish i could say that the rest of the film held up to what the opening scene had provided for the viewer. After the opening, the film goes around and shows the story of the stranger from earlier in the film, who has now been released from prison and wants to start his life over again. Now while this would have been a good premise for a thriller in the drama section, it seems really out of place in the horror section. Watching the stranger go to a bar and get in a fight, would be exciting in any other movie, if you actually cared about the character involved and if it helped the plot move forward. But watching the film i wish i had been called by a stranger just so i could have had something to do while this sloooooooooooooow movie went on. And while the ending scene did almost match the opening scene in its creepiness, the rest of the movie is not enough to make a viewer sit and watch the rest of the film. So if you rent this movie, my advice is to either not watch it, cause it is really a pretty big waste of your time, or to watch the opening scene, and then fast forward to the ending scene. Maybe at least that would trick you into believeing that you were actually watching a good movie.

It was the director's follow-up to Carrie, and here the horror of suburban school life is replaced with some more outrageously violent, practically astounding moments. There's also a lot of plot going on, too, or at least it might seem that way. Sometimes, too, the action and turns have to depend on a complete suspension of disbelief logic. De Palma holds this logic steady enough, and provides a combination of a Government thriller and psychic power drama. What helps though is the casting, as Kirk Douglas in hero mode works best through this very narrowly focused man on a mission; John Cassavetes in one of his very best acting roles as the cold- though devil-friendly- antagonist as he kidnaps his 'gifted' son. Amy Irving fills up the rest of the main acting bill as the female counterpart to the son, getting images and (bad) connections with what's happening to him. So, it is sort of silly stuff, but also taken seriously enough in this thriller form to go with. Occasionally there will be something that isn't directed quite well enough even when something interesting is going on. But most, if not all, of the scenes with a lot of action and multiple, gruesome deaths and various bleedings via psychic boy\/girl, are fun and entertaining in that very stylish way that De Palma has with his thrillers, giving the audience what they've paid to see and such. And for the greater part of the film I bought into it, that Douglas could be this old man with enough sense to match skills as an ex-agent, or that Andrew Stevens as the son and Irving could be convincing as vulnerable, confused teens with certain 'unstable' ways. De Palma also gets some great atmospheric backup from John Williams' score, and the pleasure in the plausibility of some of the more graphic scenes. Whether it's up to par with the director's best work would depend on how much of a fan one might be of his more crazy, over-the-top pictures with darkly comic scenes amassed into a potboiler of a story that would make Hitchcock probably grin and wince in equal measure. By the way, the hype that has been brought up by the critics regarding the final scene lives up to it, and it's one of the best scenes of De Palma's career in just the sheer 'wow' level of gustiness, some pun intended.

That, still, was fascinating as much as it ever was, even though it's never been a happy one. It's still good stuff.The first two hours of this 172-minute movie turn out to be more of characterizations that anything else, although it details what went into making the escape from this German prison camp possible. Some of that is interesting, such as Chales Bronson's claustrophobia and Donald Pleasance's eyesight deterioration, etc.With stars like Steve McQueen, James Garner, James Coburn, Richard Attenborough, Bronson, Pleasance and James Donald you will get some characters you'll remember for a long time especially, I found, McQueen's and Bronson's.Now that it is out on a special two-disc DVD which gives it a decent picture (there was an earlier DVD that wasn't much better than the VHS) and some features, it should climb back up the ladder on my rating of it.

Some of that is interesting, such as Chales Bronson's claustrophobia and Donald Pleasance's eyesight deterioration, etc.With stars like Steve McQueen, James Garner, James Coburn, Richard Attenborough, Bronson, Pleasance and James Donald you will get some characters you'll remember for a long time especially, I found, McQueen's and Bronson's.Now that it is out on a special two-disc DVD which gives it a decent picture (there was an earlier DVD that wasn't much better than the VHS) and some features, it should climb back up the ladder on my rating of it. Regardless, this will always be considered on the best of the World War II movies. ","genre":"Adventure, Drama, History"}]
