","genre":"Animation, Action, Adventure"},{"date":"4 September 2015","score":"","review":" Perhaps it's due to time and perspective, but the Transformers 1986 animated movie is a big breath of fresh air - compared to the Michael Bay films, of course. Yes, this film is noisy and busy and it has a bunch of characters who, if you're not previously familiarized with them, may go by at times in a blur. And actually, no not kidding, there is a Transformer named Blurr by the way, who of course is the fast-talking robot. But besides the point, this is a movie that is very naked about it being from a TV show, itself taken from a line of toys. It's not there to be very deep and doesn't pretend to be, though it has a couple of oddly ballsy moves that I'll get to in a moment. It's there to entertain boys ages 5 to 10. And that isn't one of those trivial points; the age distinction should be listed on the side of the tape like on the side of an action figure or video game console.The plot... oh sheesh. So the Autobots have to fight the Decepticons (duh), and this time there's a, also no kidding, a giant Transformer that is basically a giant, spherical AI that eats planets. Or maybe Unicron IS a planet, or a planet made of artificial intelligence, I don't know, but this thing is coming after, well, everything, and it becomes a thing where even Megatron, the ostensible villain, is groveling at Unicron's, uh, not-feet. So the movie becomes a series of action scenes to string along this thin story, also involving a Transformer named Hot-Rod, who we can kind of distinguish because there's a little boy (the only human I think in the film) who is by its side when an attack happens on Earth.This is thin stuff, but it shouldn't be about the plot, right? The downside of course is that there IS a lot of exposition to get through, not at all times but frequent enough, and while, unlike in the Bay films, I can tell the robots apart visually I got lost when it sometimes came to just remember such-and-such's name. Of course the gaggle of celebrity voices does help things, and some of them are character actors (very memorable ones to boot) Leonard Nimoy, Eric Idle, Judd Nelson, Lionel Stander (ever seen Cul de Sac?), Scatman Crothers and, wait, Casey Kasem was in this too(!) You can remember who some are since they are so distinctive, and Nimoy actually does a really memorable job as Galvatron, the upgrade for Megatron. I think, anyway.The one that makes the film almost notorious in a weird way is Orson Welles. This was the end of the line for the man who started in movies as Charles Foster Effing Kane. It's been said that it's the sort of bottom low for someone of his stature to hit by the (what wasn't known as) the end of his career at the time. And yet, call me crazy, but Unicron was one of the most fascinating parts about the whole movie. Yes, it's a kids movie involving fighting robots in space - and all the better that it barely takes place on Earth - but the concept of a gigantic robot, so massive that it has the impending doom of the Death Star from Star Wars, is a cool and curious piece of intelligent 'what-if'-ness.Though it's ultimately put to use for a 'Transformation' by the climax, I liked the idea that other robots, all robots, and worlds, would have to submit to this giant force, or what's called in psychology and philosophy as the Big Other. It also just looks cool in the movie, and has depths and dimensions and designed parts that make it wholly stand out from most of the Transformer characters, who all have blank faces. At least Unicron, for as much as you might mock the name or its purpose to just consume, is distinctive and fits that out-there, science fiction cum comic book ideal. And Welles, albeit with an added post-production growl to his voice, does the character a deadly kind of presence that works as a performance.If only I could actually care about some of these situations, or if the script was just a little more focused; the section with Optimus Prime early on is the exception, which seems to come as a big 'Oh Wow' moment story-wise - taking out one of your main characters for what one almost assumes could be the end of the movie (all scored to You Got the Touch in epic fashion). It should be noted this was a 'bridge' between seasons 2 and 3 of the show, so this might have been an even bigger deal if one was attached to the cartoon. Just taking the movie on its own terms, it's a fairly bold move - maybe too bold considering the scope of the rest of the production.What else does one remember after the fire and fury of a movie like Transformers? Maybe the Sharktocons (sic) who have an appearance that brings out chuckles? Or how it's unmistakably Eric Idle as the one Transformer with a mustache and, of course, doing improv? Or the soundtrack (80's hair metal glory). A lot of this story is so light that it just barely makes up like three or four episodes connected of what the show would be, and the quality of the animation varies between having genuinely impressive and creative designs and effects, and looking just on level with all the other 80's animation of the period (Ninja Turtles and, to an extent, X-Men come to mind). But here, again, because of how the Transformers are designed, you can't exactly get too wrapped up in any of their features, just their voices. It is what it is, though it carries a certain charm I can never say the new Paramount productions carry.

Through the scene they begin to conspire to rob the diner, and the scene ends when they stand up and threaten everybody in the diner. The film ends in the same place, when two of the main characters walk into the diner before these events unfold. One of the men pulls a gun, yet he does not use it and instead decides to peacefully make them leave. Although this scene unfolds at the beginning and the end of the film, it chronologically takes place around the middle, and on top of that, it heavily includes a character that you had seen die about half an hour earlier. Everything happens in such a peculiar order because of the structure of this film After a brief prologue there are three chapters, Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife, The Gold Watch and The Bonnie Situation. The two scenes from the prologue, and the three main stories mixed up, out of chronological order. However, they are not all mixed up in a clumsy messy way that makes the story incoherent, in fact it is quite the opposite. The stories are mixed up in a more artful way and improves the way that the story is told. So is the jumbled story what makes Pulp Fiction so loved? No. The jumbled story doesn't actually improve the plot, it just tells it in a different order. A good example to compare this to is Citizen Kane as it is also told in a nonlinear fashion. The thing about that film is that it is not about the journalists, and the quest to find the meaning of rosebud its about the story of Charles Foster Kane. Although the film begins about that, and it is what I would call the plot of the film, it is really the story of Kane, and it is told through flashbacks because Welles wanted to make the way the story was told more compelling. It is there to amplify the what is already there, but without the a good quality story, there is really nothing to amplify. This goes for both Pulp Fiction and Citizen Kane. So what makes the plot of Pulp Fiction so good without the unconventional storytelling? The dialogue. The dialogue is the key to this film. Whether it is quick, short lines and conversations, of huge monologues, they all seem to have something to say. Take, for example the conversation between Jules and Vincent that takes place just after the credits and runs up until they enter Brett's apartment. This conversation takes up about ten minutes of the film and it really feeds into the story very little. That conversation could have lasted ten seconds, and would have had everything it needed to set up any conversation later in the film. Although it barely feeds into the rest of the film, it all sends on very important message about these two characters This job is completely routine and meaningless to them, and the fact that they are soon to take multiple lives does not affect them or matter to them at all. Another example from this film is the monologue from Marcellus to Butch. This is when Marcellus is paying Butch his money to lose the next match, and he talks about how, during the fight he will feel a 'slight stain'. This, he says, is pride, and he goes on to say pride isn't useful, and all it does is hurt. Whether it's this, the conversation between Butch and the taxi driver about how it feels to kill someone, the conversation between Mia and Vincent about meaningless small talk, or the monologue from Jules at the end of his arc, about how he does not want to kill the bandits although he easily would have hours earlier, they all say something about the characters, and their nature. One of the main characters in the film is Jules Winfeild. Jules was a hit-man at the beginning of the film, but after he thought he had witnessed divine intervention, he suddenly transfers to a man of god. Jules clearly knows a lot about Christianity, as he has a passage he knows, that he reads before killing someone, but it seems that it takes this little push to actually make him comprehend the passage he has learned and want to become a better man. The interesting thing about his arc is that, although he wants to become a better man, it is really harder for him than it seems. For example, when Vincent accidentally shoots Marvin, Jules seems to care more about getting the car off the road, because people may see it, than actually being upset and disturbed at the sight of the death. Also, later on when they are cleaning blood and body parts off the car, Jules seems annoyed about having to clean the car, and how he shouldn't be doing it as it wasn't his fault. Ideally, however, he should have been deeply saddened by what he is doing. I think this is because, it is merely an idea in his head that he has changed, and really, it is not in his nature to be a great Christian. In my opinion, his character is ultimately a murderer and a bad person, and despite the great monologue in the final scene, he is probably incapable of changing his own human nature.Pulp Fiction is full of great separate plot threads, and colourful characters who give amazing dialogue, which all makes a fantastic story. On top of that, the story is told in such a great way it hugely amplifies the already impeccable story, and therefore creates what is in my opinion, one of the greatest movies ever made.

Also, later on when they are cleaning blood and body parts off the car, Jules seems annoyed about having to clean the car, and how he shouldn't be doing it as it wasn't his fault. Ideally, however, he should have been deeply saddened by what he is doing. I think this is because, it is merely an idea in his head that he has changed, and really, it is not in his nature to be a great Christian. In my opinion, his character is ultimately a murderer and a bad person, and despite the great monologue in the final scene, he is probably incapable of changing his own human nature.Pulp Fiction is full of great separate plot threads, and colourful characters who give amazing dialogue, which all makes a fantastic story. On top of that, the story is told in such a great way it hugely amplifies the already impeccable story, and therefore creates what is in my opinion, one of the greatest movies ever made.

Many purists will no doubt complain about what's been left out or the depictions of some characters. Others will say that the story ends abruptly and, since there was never a part two, it leaves the movie feeling incomplete. Still others will talk about the uneven mixture of traditional animation and rotoscoping. All of those are valid complaints but not major ones for me. Granted, I saw the Jackson films already so there was a certain degree of comparison that was inevitable, however unfair that may be. I'm certainly not going to slight the movie for not being able to compete with something made decades later with a budget over twenty times what this had (for the first movie of the trilogy alone). I'm also not going to nitpick what was left out or who didn't look like they should because the Jackson series gave fans a gazillion hours of footage of to cover almost every base. The animation is good for the era and I generally appreciate Bakshi's use of rotoscoping. The man was an artist, not an assembly-line animator like most at the time, and that should be praised.The main problem I had with this is that it is not as emotionally involving as the Tolkien story demands. It's a story that deserves a deeper treatment than what we have here. That came later with Jackson, thankfully, but the lack of emotional resonance in this version is a major flaw. I also wish the music score wasn't so unexciting and forgettable. I've read that Bakshi originally wanted to use Led Zeppelin music. At first that sounds like a terrible idea but I can't help but wonder if that would have been so weird that it actually worked. Overall, it's a mixed bag that drags some and never really pulls you in like it should. Bakshi respects the material enough to follow it as closely as he can with the restrictions he had. He also creates some fine atmosphere and fills the movie with so many interesting visuals that it's hard to dismiss it entirely.

I have seen it before but its been years. I fell in love with the book when I read it in High School and the film is probably one of, if not thee, most beloved adaptations to film ever made and its easy to see why. The same heart and soul that brings the book to life comes through in the film equally and that is no easy feat. Its a coming of age film, but its also a film completely and utterly indicative of its time and locale. You're not watching a movie, you are completely involved in this little town and in the Finch family. You are standing right there with Scout and Jem and you are in silent awe of the powerful and yet subtle man that is Atticus Finch. Gregory Peck was likely born to play this role as was several of the other characters. The film is so mysterious in the way they approach Boo Radley that you are literally a kid on the street with them anxious and curious about Radley. For whatever reason we don't see the accused Tom Robinson until well through halfway the film. Despite being black and white, there is something vibrant and completely powerful about the setting of the film. And the closing battle in the courtroom is easily one of the most awe inspiring scenes in cinema history period.Gregory Peck was an icon of Hollywood long before this and long after. I'm not sure I've even see other work by him yet. His portrayal of Atticus Finch is easily the most respected performance in cinema and its easy to see why because it is just a natural, fluid performance. He's quiet, stoic, low key and yet behind all of this you see the fire and passion for justice, a wild side of youth, the fierce protective streak he has for his children, the sadness of losing his wife...the performance is mesmerizing. You would think anyone else acting with him would pale in comparison but not the case at all. Mary Badham (Oscar nominated performance) and Phillip Alford give two of the best young person performances I've ever soon. They are completely amazing as siblings Scout and Jem. Their chemistry is untouchable, their performance mesmerizing, and the three of them (with Peck) are unbelievable. Even still this doesn't count on the amazing cast performance from the supporting characters. John Megna, Frank Overton, Brock Peters, Estelle Evans, Collin Paxton, Richard Hale, James Anderson and Robert Duvall (in his debut performance) make what is one of the best casts of a film ever. They make this little dirt poor town come to life and you don't feel empathy for them as much as you just feel like you are there experiencing it.Nowadays when a director comes exclusively from Television, I find that they have a really hard time translating stories into feature length films as opposed to serialized like TV. Director Robert Mulligan did come from Television and yet it seems like he had this ability to take an entire series worth of character development and make these characters come to life in just over two hours. He tells a lifetime of a story in one feature film and its unforgettable. That is what makes To Kill A Mockingbird a classic...you watch it and you will never forget it. Lines that Scout and Atticus speak, Peck's infamous closing dialogue at the trial, Boo Radley's appearance...you can just watch this again and again and take something different away from it or experience it as though you were watching for the first time.

Of course I had seen Office Space before my most recent viewing (yesterday) and there were some memorable parts. Watching it again on the big screen a few years later, I realized yes, there are memorable parts to this comedy, but to tell you the truth, this is actually kind of a boring story.This is the only film I have seen Ron Livingston in, as well as the actors who play his sort of friends at the office. It's sad when you are told there is a great comedy out there, but then you realize the only person you know in the movie (and still had a career afterwards) is Jennifer Aniston. However, Stephen Root steals the show as the ever-mumbling Milton. What a wacky awkward character that brings a grin to your face every time you see him. He is like an adorable whimpering puppy that you can't help but feel sorry for since he is clearly not a great people person. I'd imagine his character was what the movie was based on since the film was apparently derived from a comic titled Milton.The famous printer-destroying scene it really shouldn't be that famous at all. It's just three guys smashing a printer in slow motion. It holds no merit, and while it has rap playing in the background to reflect the character Michael Bolton's taste in music as well as the fact that the three are more hood now that they have ripped off their company, it's barely memorable.At least the film's protagonist, Peter, makes some progress in the film. He starts out by hating his job, and his life luckily gets easier after he visits a hypnotherapist who tells him to relax and then dies abruptly. After this, Peter lives life how he wants to, and despite his not going into work actually gets promoted due to his honesty and relaxed attitude. He then gradually starts becoming concerned with work life again, and by the conclusion he has found a balance between work and leisure.This so-called great comedy provides few laughs, but is really easy to follow which is probably why people like it. For me, I'd rewatch this film just for the parts with Stephen Root as Milton, but that's about it. If you're looking for intelligent humor - let alone a good laugh at all - don't look here.

What the hell was that asshole on at the time!? Break dancing scene, what the f**k!?! I really can't stand the red-headed Lisa Pelican as Rebecca, she's so embarrassingly melodramatic with all of her lines and whenever the camera's focusing on her face she's always off in a fog and terribly posing as if like Sophia Loren! Awful actress. I also didn't like the two dwarf characters. Now I've nothing against those kinds of people, in fact to me their performances were actually very good, but they weren't monsters, and in my opinion to jerk around with the audience that they are when there's already supposed to be little monsters running around is just bogus. It's the same cheap gag that they would later base the entire rotten fourth 'Ghoulies' movie around. I positively adored the spirited performance of Michael Des Barnes as the delightfully fiendish Malcolm Graves. He really gives it his all and even though he goes ridiculously grandiose with it, it sure works. I can't recall ever seeing another horror movie villain quite like him. I love all of his charmingly bizarre inflections, how he goes from softly-spoken to roaring in a second! And it's so awesomely wrong when he demands to kiss his son to steal his soul!! I thought he was far more charismatic than the guy who played his son, I just found iy plain cringe-worthy whenever he was trying to be commanding. They also should've ditched the silly and unnecessary narrating. It was like I was watching Troll 2 all over again.. I think that I may have liked this better if they'd have just done away with any pretence of it being about little monsters and made it a straight-up story of resurrected sorcerous evil battling against its estranged offspring it could've stood on its own merit surely! I mean they certainly should have kept the ghoulies in it, just not made it out as if the entire movie was about them.. And you know, I'm wrong in a way because the marketing did pay off big time for the studio, and if I don't quite get it then I'm still very glad because it allowed them to create some later gems that I do wholeheartedly love and regard as classics. It's such a weird little mish-mash of a flick. By degrees it's a crazy party horror movie, then a domestic drama, then it's an epic magical fight of good vs evil - it's everything except a solid horror that knows what it wants to be, and that's a bit of a shame. I'm not saying it isn't fun, but it's a mess. It's a fun mess! Everything about it is extremely tacky and rough but that could perhaps only add to the appeal for some fans. It's certainly not lacking in creativity. It's a fun and entertaining piece of horror trash if you're in the right frame of mind and is worthy of a watch every now and then. Shut up, goddammit!

Like the warm voice-over of Wilde's own short story THE SELFISH GIANT whenever the story draws in with Oscar's interactions with his two young sons, Wilde is the giant, who is destined to suffer from the wounds of love, again, Fry's performance is unarguably the film's strongest suit, notably his speech about the unspeakable love during the court scenes.Oscar Wilde's astonishing talent and homosexuality are two sides of his personae, as one might expect, the film follows suit in exploring the more sensational latter, while the former can only be glanced through his witty loquaciousness and the aforementioned court speech, truly, the gay melodrama is what audience ask for, only if we could also given some leeway to enter his kingdom as a writer. Then the drama, Bosie is viewed as a capricious, needy, ungrateful and selfish good-for-nothing, who is the undoing of Oscar Wilde's tragedy, ended with an early death in destitute. There is unequalled devotion between them, which Wilde is not too blind to notice, but his naivety, a common characteristic among great artists, convinces him that Bosie is a spoilt boy who needs love wantonly and inordinately, and he is willing to do whatever he asks, and eventually comes down from his high horse and becomes a convenient lever utilised in the detrimental father-son retaliation between Bosie and his father. Fry gives a sympathetic performance, but for Wilde, we can only assume that he has only himself to blame, meanwhile, the film makes Robbie, his sole loyal friend in his last days, watch the doom befalls on the one he loves, they would make a much better match, only if Wilde could be more sensible in his mind (takes the gargoyle- looking over the pretty boy), that's the typical gambit for a melodrama, as if that happens so common in real life.Jennifer Ehle, who REALLY should play Meryl Streep in a biopic, is the benevolent but tormented wife who marries a closeted gay man, but instead of hatred and complaint, her support of Wilde, defiance against the convention, even in his lowest moment is a shining beacon in this biopic, Ehle elicits amazing nuance in it. This is the very first role introduces Jude Law into the international cinema, where his Adonis attractiveness would peak two years later in Anthony Minghella's THE TALENTED MR.

And the reason why Mommy couldn't stay anymore... was because she couldn't stand me. She didn't leave because of you. She left because of me.Robert Benton's third feature film, Kramer vs. Kramer, still stands out as his best. This 1979 family drama which explores interpersonal relationships and the effect divorce has on the family, remains very relevant in today's society. It is one of those rare classics that has managed to age very well due to its universal theme. In order for an authentic drama like this to work you need a strong script and believable actors. Kramer vs. Kramer has both, Robert Benson did an amazing job with the screenplay adaptation of Avery Corman's novel and the dialogue in the film feels authentic while avoiding any false notes. And of course you couldn't have had anyone better than Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep to play the divorced couple. Hoffman was already at the height of his career, while Streep was just getting started proving she's always been an out of this world actress. Both actors won their first Academy Awards for this film, and it wouldn't be their last. But in a film like this no matter how good the adult characters are, you need to have a child who can win over the sympathy of the audience and engage them emotionally. Benton made a huge gamble when he hired inexperienced Justin Henry for the role, but it payed off marvelously. At only 8 years old Henry was nominated for his supporting role. The scenes he shares with Hoffman are endearing and the relationship between the two is the center of the film. It was the subtle moments that the two shared together that stuck with me the most, like the scene where the kid challenges his father's authority by eating the ice cream. These were improvised scenes, but they added to the authenticity of the film. That relationship between both of them is key, as we witness the transition and evolution of Hoffman's character.The film opens with a shot of Joanna Kramer (Meryl Streep) packing her clothes in a suitcase while she waits for her husband, Ted (Dustin Hoffman) to return home from work so that she can break the news to him that she is leaving him. Apparently she has been unhappy for quite some time now and she wants to discover who she is. Despite being heartbroken about having to abandon her young son, Billy (Justin Henry), she is convinced she has to go. Ted, who hasn't the slightest clue about housekeeping, must now learn to manage his work while taking care of his son. During the early scenes we see what an inexperienced father he is, he can't prepare breakfast for Billy without burning everything. But as the movie progresses we begin to see the transformation that Ted goes through and what a caring father he becomes. His career does begin to suffer and he begins struggling to keep his job, but he has learned to put his son's life before his own. With the help of his friendly neighbor, Margaret (Jane Alexander), he becomes an expert at parenting, but that is around the time that Joanna returns back to the city and tells Ted she wants to take her son with him. A court battle for their son's custody ensues as neither parent refuses to live without their son. The film builds a great father and son dynamic during most of its runtime and that is what makes the courtroom drama so compelling near the end because the stakes have been settled. I don't think this film would've won the Oscar for Best Picture if it weren't for those intense scenes during the trial. The testimony each parent gives is compelling and the performances in those scenes were superb, but I actually enjoyed the quieter and more subtle moments in this film. The scenes were Hoffman is sharing some time at the park with his son or simply reading a story to him. Those were the moments that made this film ring true and authentic. I think that the film could've ended on a stronger note if it decided to have ended some five minutes before it actually did because it ties things up too neatly at the end. The final kitchen scene would've been the perfect moment to end it, but I won't complain too much because the film is compelling and the performances had me engaged from the very opening scene.

This could have made for some really interesting stuff, but it is brushed aside in favour of less cerebral subjects.This is an abject lesson in what studio meddling can do to a film. It's not great - it could have been very good had it been left alone - but it's not as terrible as some suggest. I'd give it 5.5, but the system doesn't allow for that so a 6 it is.

Unfortunately Scream 3 becomes what it originally it intended to spoof. The scares aren't as effective as the first or the second, but the kills are solid. Liev Schreiber's role is reduced to a cameo, and he's killed from the beginning. To be honest the only really effective kill that means something in the entire film. The killer tormenting Sidney with the death of her mother, while also using her voice are some of the film's strongest elements as well. Though Wes Craven's influence is felt, this film is sorely missing Kevin Williamson's flare. It's obvious that it feels completely different from the first two. Neve Campbell's role feels just a tad bit reduced, mainly because she's isolated herself from everyone and everything. Which is a neat concept to watch because you feel for her paranoia and can understand why she is the way she is after experiencing such traumatic events. David Arquette and Courteney Cox seem like the main characters right from the get-go. Unlike the first two the cast are unlikable aside from the three leads. They are basically fodder. I did however liked Deon Richmond's character for the short amount of time he's in. Some of the characters also make some pretty questionable choices as well. The twist and killer reveal is pretty cool. Scott Foley's character is Roman Bridger, Sidney's half brother. The Scream films have at least two killers, but this is the first time it breaks that rule of having just one killer. Pretty impressive that Roman was able to do all that by himself. We also get a nice special cameo from Jamie Kennedy's Randy. It's alright. It's not terrible, it feels a lot more lighter compared to the first two, but because they are almost perfect examples of a great slasher film it pales in comparison. The movie within the movie, set in Hollywood was an honorable approach but it just wasn't executed the way it should have been. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 September 2015","score":"","review":" It's an underwhelming third entry to the franchise, but there's some good stuff in it.

Its heated, in-your-face dialogue, hardened criminals, coarse language, and particularly its non-linear story line, peppered with occasional scenes of hilarious comic relief, ushered in a new era in filmmaking. Often copied but never equaled, Pulp Fiction made a star out of its young writer\/director, Quentin Tarantino.But many of us may not realize Pulp Fiction was actually Tarantino's second film. His first was 1992's Reservoir Dogs, a caustic, claustrophobic paean to the great caper noir films of yesteryear, updated for a more percipient audience. The highly original story involves a diamond robbery which we never see. Think Deliverance without the rape scene. We're treated to an opening scene in which a mob boss and his son have coffee at a diner across the street from the soon-to-be crime scene, along with a bevy of hardened career criminals hired for the heist. The men, previously unknown to one another, don't use their real names. Instead, they refer to each other as Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, Mr. White, Mr. Brown, and so forth. They are played by some of the best tough-guy actors of the day &#x96; Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, Chris Penn.The next scene takes place immediately after the robbery. Something has apparently gone wrong. One or more of the criminals has been shot. The rest of the action takes place at a nearby abandoned warehouse, in which the remaining criminals attempt to find out which of them, if any, is an informant. Here, we delight as the double-crosses accumulate like horseflies in a swamp at dusk.Interspersed with the warehouse scenes, Tarantino gives us flashbacks highlighting the backstories of each of the primary criminals. This serves to break up the present-day action and give us some breathing room, as it were, while pulling back the covers of cynicism we instantly develop about each of these characters at the beginning. In other words, the more we learn about each of the major players, the more we understand the ongoing warehouse scene.Having seen Pulp Fiction before Reservoir Dogs (as did most filmgoers), a lot of Tarantino's trademark effects first cultivate in the earlier picture. While not as brilliantly effective as in Pulp Fiction, the non-linear screenplay is first on display in Reservoir Dogs, with the individual backstories shedding light on the robbery aftermath. As in Pulp Fiction, once the movie ends, we then want to see it again from the beginning, due to our now-complete hindsight.Reservoir Dogs first introduces the Tarantino trait of uncomfortable scenes which are intentionally too long. The best of these features the great character actor Michael Madsen, as Mr. Blonde (Yeah, I know; he's not really blonde), torturing a police hostage for information. After slicing off his ear, Madsen douses the cop in gasoline, then continues to talk to him while holding a lit match &#x96; all the while Stealer's Wheel's 1973 hit Stuck In The Middle With You plays on the radio in the background. But before the cop can be set afire, Mr. Orange (who's passed out on the floor in the corner, due to a gunshot received during the robbery) rises to life and kills Mr. Blonde &#x96; because he's the informant.This stuff is classic Tarantino &#x96; from the non-dead body, to the classic pop\/rock oldies, to the double-crosses, to the mordant, uncomfortable nature of the scene itself. He's employed these techniques for the past twenty years. This scene is the first.While the majority of the film takes place on a barren stage, if you will, I like the fact that we don't actually view the robbery take place. Why does Tarantino eliminate the apogee of the film? Because it isn't truly necessary! Much as the real heft of Deliverance takes place after the rape scene, Tarantino has given us the longest denouement in film history &#x96; everything after the opening credits! Again, think about Pulp Fiction. Remember that we never see John Travolta accidentally shoot the man in the back seat of the car. We hear the gunshot, then Travolta and his cohorts spend the next fifteen minutes dealing with cleaning blood off the vehicle's interior. That's what we have here. Reservoir Dogs is about the clean-up, if you will, of a flawed heist.My favorite scene of all is the first. Remember in Pulp Fiction how audiences latched on to the humorous dialogue between Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, as they discussed what the French call a Big Mac sandwich? Same here, but even funnier. As this tableful of career criminals plans a horrible crime, they discuss the fine details of the lyrics to Vicki Lawrence's hit song, The Night The Lights Went Out In Georgia. Really. It's a seemingly effortless marriage of downright unpleasantness coupled with meaningless everyday conversation. We find it funny, but it's probably more realistic than screenplays in which every uttered line is pertinent to the plot. No one has perfected this technique as well as Quentin Tarantino.In fact, no one has come close to mimicking Tarantino's love for the cinema, processed and regurgitated from a unique perspective, and thrown back at us in classic film after classic film. I always claimed no one could watch a Stanley Kubrick film in the background. In other words, if a Kubrick film were on television, you were instantly drawn to it. You couldn't knit, play cards, read the paper, or think about anything else. Same is true of Tarantino. He's still one of our greatest living directors, and it's a thrill to go back and watch his very first work. That's why Reservoir Dogs is this month's Buried Treasure.

Again, think about Pulp Fiction. Remember that we never see John Travolta accidentally shoot the man in the back seat of the car. We hear the gunshot, then Travolta and his cohorts spend the next fifteen minutes dealing with cleaning blood off the vehicle's interior. That's what we have here. Reservoir Dogs is about the clean-up, if you will, of a flawed heist.My favorite scene of all is the first. Remember in Pulp Fiction how audiences latched on to the humorous dialogue between Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, as they discussed what the French call a Big Mac sandwich? Same here, but even funnier. As this tableful of career criminals plans a horrible crime, they discuss the fine details of the lyrics to Vicki Lawrence's hit song, The Night The Lights Went Out In Georgia. Really. It's a seemingly effortless marriage of downright unpleasantness coupled with meaningless everyday conversation. We find it funny, but it's probably more realistic than screenplays in which every uttered line is pertinent to the plot. No one has perfected this technique as well as Quentin Tarantino.In fact, no one has come close to mimicking Tarantino's love for the cinema, processed and regurgitated from a unique perspective, and thrown back at us in classic film after classic film. I always claimed no one could watch a Stanley Kubrick film in the background. In other words, if a Kubrick film were on television, you were instantly drawn to it. You couldn't knit, play cards, read the paper, or think about anything else. Same is true of Tarantino. He's still one of our greatest living directors, and it's a thrill to go back and watch his very first work. That's why Reservoir Dogs is this month's Buried Treasure.

It's not the premise that is so strange - the bare bones of the plot read like they could be made into a typical comedy - but rather the execution. Although there are a number of attempts at humor throughout the movie (and I admit that I did find some of these attempts amusing), there is a strong serious undercurrent. It seems that the movie is trying to say something, though what that is I cannot say for sure. But there are deeper problem with the movie. It takes quite a while for it to get going, for one thing. And once it gets going, it seems to have a number of moments where key footage seems missing or wasn't filmed at all in the first place. But all the same, I am kind of glad that I saw the movie, because it's the rare major studio production to really be strange and offbeat - which is refreshing in an age of cookie cutter plots and lack of imagination. I would recommend this movie to viewers who want something different and are ready to accept something that is an interesting failure of sorts.
