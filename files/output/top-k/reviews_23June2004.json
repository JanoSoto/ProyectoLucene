There isn't anything great here, so why all the fuss? It's not original, and if you think it is you didn't see Dark City or a slew of others....the story is very slow, it's pretentious beyond words, and the acting is absolutely terrible to the point that it's hard to sit through without wanting to bite a running chainsaw, all thanks to the abysmally talented Reeves and Laurence Lamprey aka Cowboy Curtis. The ending is also weak, and don't tell me it's because they had planned on making a sequel because movies should be able to stand alone.....and don't even get me started on the sequels. At least they're not too overrated. I have felt this way since 1999 when it came out and I went to see it in the theater. When it was finally over, I said, That's it?!Let's go over this piece, shall we? People praise this film for it's fight choreography, when the people fighting are tools like Fishburne and Reeves. Are you serious? I can't help but to laugh out loud at Keanu in the dojo training scene with Lamprey. He looks like he's got a Klingon dagger rammed up his butt! This is the One?! I can't think of anyone more miscast. Actually, I can't think of a film where he wouldn't be miscast. True, a lot of my discontent with this film comes from the actors, but even with decent actors I still think it would've failed. The story is also sloppy and filled with more useless techno-babble than a quantum-physics book from Brent Spiner's Data from the Star Trek The Next Generation series. To sum it up, it doesn't make any sense. People as batteries? OK. For a movie that spouts so much techno-babble at you, it's not very technical. It's all a red herring.My biggest problem with the people that like this film is that they praise it for it's originality when that could not be further from the truth. Do your research or just watch more movies and you'll begin to realize that this film is nothing more than a long list of rip-offs from others films....and it gets the credit for all of it. This isn't the film's fault, it's the uneducated fans....the same fans responsible for it's ridiculously lofty rating here at IMDb. I think the rip-offs were intentional personally, and I don't think even the Wachowski brothers thought it'd be as successful as it was because of it.Criminally overrated....and will not stand the test of time.

Without spoiling anything in the story itself, Norton's character, an insomniac white collar worker bee, has become extremely unhappy with his life although he has everything he needs. But does he? Tyler Durden (Pitt) is an interesting stranger who has absolutely nothing as far as material possessions go, but he does seem much richer. Is he really? It all gets interesting when the two join together to make a fight club of sorts to basically feel more alive and see what happens when they push things to the limit.

Die Hard is simply a very progressive, accelerated and perfectly paced action movie, not only does it tell a good story, and even comes with a few complexes, it also brings some of the best and most solid action ever to be seen.John McTiernan has proven to be a solid action director over the years, after the breakthrough with Predator he made this classic action flick, that never seems to be getting old, even now. 17 years later, it still works as well as it did 17 years ago, brilliant.This is just what I suppose we can call a perfect popcorn movie, the kind of movie where you lean back and just let the thrill ride begin, you know things will end happily, but still it entertains for the 2 hours it lasts, and it entertains at a very high level. Perhaps one of the weaknesses of the movie is the happy ending, I would have loved a darker ending, leaving something to think about, especially since there obviously is the problematic climax involved in the movie, there are some good side stories, especially the dramatic with John and Holly's marriage. Strangely that works out perfectly and we get to know everything about it, even though the movie actually doesn't spend much time explaining, it's just done so well and perfectly direct that we basically know everything about these two when the movie ends.I am not sure if this was a final breakthrough for Bruce Willis, but he definetely shows in this movie what great actor he is, we see a lot of different sides of him, the tough guy, the soft guy, and even better, the funny guy. I hardly ever láugh in movies, and I hate unserious movies that are trying to hard to make you laugh, but the jokes in this movie are perfect, especially the one signed by Bruce Willis, I loved his attitude, perfect performance!To sum it all up a bit, as we always do. This is a really great action classic, an unforgettable movie that never gets old, no matter how many times you watch it, this must be like the 5th time for me, and it's still highly entertaining, it has no slow moments and just moves out there at a perfect pace for 2 hours. The weak sides is perhaps that it's such a classic and traditional action movie that we know the end before the movie starts, sadly, an ending that would have left me breathless would have been better for me, but maybe other people think differently.

A few years back, it was rare that a contemporary film was picked as greatest.  Citizen Kane, Le Grand Illusion, The Gold Rush and other pre-1950 films usually got the nod well into the 1980's.Then, for some reason, most likely the Internet opening up a voice for the average person to rate film, contemporary films started getting in.  Schindler's List was one that comes to mind.  Shawshank Redemption is another.While picking the same old, stale films year after year doesn't seem to be logical, picking newer ones has a certain risk.  Many films amaze and beguile audiences when they come out because they are geared to what currently sells.  As years passed, the flaws become apparent and they drop out of sight, while timeless films initially received lukewarmly, or even critically, such as The Wizard of Oz, The General, or Intolerance soar.  Will The Shawshank Redemption drop into obscurity, too?  I don't think so.  Why?  One can try to explain.Two possible reasons are Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.  I don't know if either are underrated actors or not, but I rarely hear people remark how completely they transform themselves from role to role.  This is certainly the case here. The two performances, and the chemistry between the two men is the core of the film and reinforces one of its primary messages never let anyone make you lose hope.  The fact the setting, prison, is alien to most filmgoer's experience, doesn't matter.  Shawshank could never be considered a prison film.  It contains a story as archetypal as The Odyssey, a long journey, through many dangers, that ends with the traveler (this time, two travelers) seen to a safe shore (literally!).Another great strength of Shawshank is how it operates on different levels.  Like Jon Avnet's Fried Green Tomatoes, it has its most obvious message--about not losing hope and surviving--set highest.  But as Tomatoes had a gay subtext that could be acknowledged or ignored, so does Shawshank, that prison is a dehumanizing experience that ends up ruining people for life rather than just letting them pay their debts to society and move on.Given this country's conservative bent, it is somewhat bizarre that a film that carries this message is so adored.  All I can say is the other aspects of the film allow one to ignore it and still enjoy it, which is probably fitting since films where the message is the most important thing, such as those of the '50's and '60's, now show their age badly. In the final analysis, though, regardless of what elements we pick at, we ultimately can't say why Shawshank is so great.  We just know it is by how we feel and how others feel.Two final examples of the latter.  Spoiler  The moment in Andy's escape when he stands in the sewage lagoon outside the prison and holds his arms up in jubilation as the rain pours on him is always a part of trailers and coming attractions.  Indeed it was part one of the film's original ads.  Why should the filmmakers give away the ending?  Because there is nothing to give away.  One can see the film 100 times knowing Andy will escape and still want to see it, because it isn't about an escape plot.  It's about Andy and Red's journey and what they teach each other.The second example is that the Lifetime Channel, which generally shows either classic Chick Flicks like Thelma and Louise, or made for TV things about unfaithful or homicidal husbands, showed this as their feature presentation one evening and this is a film that really has no women in it at all.Of course, one can argue a Chick Flick is really just a film that values exploration of deep human feelings and relationships more than car chases and explosions.  If that is the case, then Shawshank is the greatest Chick Flick of them all.And I think the Greatest Film Game never fit more than here.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"23 June 2004","score":"","review":"  Rather than just enjoy movies, critics like to play The Greatest Film game.  A few years back, it was rare that a contemporary film was picked as greatest.  Citizen Kane, Le Grand Illusion, The Gold Rush and other pre-1950 films usually got the nod well into the 1980's.Then, for some reason, most likely the Internet opening up a voice for the average person to rate film, contemporary films started getting in.  Schindler's List was one that comes to mind.  Shawshank Redemption is another.While picking the same old, stale films year after year doesn't seem to be logical, picking newer ones has a certain risk.  Many films amaze and beguile audiences when they come out because they are geared to what currently sells.  As years passed, the flaws become apparent and they drop out of sight, while timeless films initially received lukewarmly, or even critically, such as The Wizard of Oz, The General, or Intolerance soar.  Will The Shawshank Redemption drop into obscurity, too?  I don't think so.  Why?  One can try to explain.Two possible reasons are Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.  I don't know if either are underrated actors or not, but I rarely hear people remark how completely they transform themselves from role to role.  This is certainly the case here. The two performances, and the chemistry between the two men is the core of the film and reinforces one of its primary messages never let anyone make you lose hope.  The fact the setting, prison, is alien to most filmgoer's experience, doesn't matter.  Shawshank could never be considered a prison film.  It contains a story as archetypal as The Odyssey, a long journey, through many dangers, that ends with the traveler (this time, two travelers) seen to a safe shore (literally!).Another great strength of Shawshank is how it operates on different levels.  Like Jon Avnet's Fried Green Tomatoes, it has its most obvious message--about not losing hope and surviving--set highest.  But as Tomatoes had a gay subtext that could be acknowledged or ignored, so does Shawshank, that prison is a dehumanizing experience that ends up ruining people for life rather than just letting them pay their debts to society and move on.Given this country's conservative bent, it is somewhat bizarre that a film that carries this message is so adored.  All I can say is the other aspects of the film allow one to ignore it and still enjoy it, which is probably fitting since films where the message is the most important thing, such as those of the '50's and '60's, now show their age badly. In the final analysis, though, regardless of what elements we pick at, we ultimately can't say why Shawshank is so great.  We just know it is by how we feel and how others feel.Two final examples of the latter.

Here, however, there are major differences which set this movie apart from the others.The prolonged scenes of Godzilla's victims in the hospitals are disturbingly reminiscent of what really happened in the aftermaths of the atomic bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki not even ten years before the film's release. The memory of such tragedies was still relatively fresh in the minds of many Japanese moviegoers and thus the message was conveyed more eloquently than the usual route of a scientist and his monologue on the misuse of atomic weapons commonly found in American monster movies at the time. Most of the serious portrayal of this theme was removed from the Americanized version of the film, as American audiences would likely be confused by such a seriously conveyed message.Aside from its deep allegorical meaning, it is also a well-made film. Too many critics put down Tsuburaya's special effects, referring to them as cheap and quickly done. While not convincing by today's standards, the effects are exceptional for the time period and should be regarded with more respect.

I'd heard a lot of good things about Amores Perros, but I hadn't heard much about the plot, which was a good thing. Half the fun of this movie realizations that you get about the plot as the movie goes on. You get more and more information about each of the characters until right at the end it all makes sense. All I will say about the plot is that it has three separate story lines that meet at a car crash then go off on their own again. And all of them have to do with dogs. Beyond that, watch the movie for yourself. The movie's title is translated to Love's a Bitch, and that is a very good representation of the themes in the movie. Love is involved in each storyline, and in each one it goes sour, or has dire consequences on the character. In the end, no one is satisfied, and pretty much everyone ends up worse off than they were at the beginning. This is absolutely brutal film-making, and it will make you wonder about the absolute futility of life portrayed here. There is very good acting all around, and all of the characters are believable. The camera-work, although it doesn't the stylish techniques that contributed so much to Requiem For A Dream, is very sturdy and never boring, although action movie fans may not like its artful touches and close-ups. In fact, action movie fans won't like this movie at all. Despite dog fighting scenes, this is definitely not an action-oriented film.

All I will say about the plot is that it has three separate story lines that meet at a car crash then go off on their own again. And all of them have to do with dogs. Beyond that, watch the movie for yourself. The movie's title is translated to Love's a Bitch, and that is a very good representation of the themes in the movie. Love is involved in each storyline, and in each one it goes sour, or has dire consequences on the character. In the end, no one is satisfied, and pretty much everyone ends up worse off than they were at the beginning. This is absolutely brutal film-making, and it will make you wonder about the absolute futility of life portrayed here. There is very good acting all around, and all of the characters are believable. The camera-work, although it doesn't the stylish techniques that contributed so much to Requiem For A Dream, is very sturdy and never boring, although action movie fans may not like its artful touches and close-ups. In fact, action movie fans won't like this movie at all. Despite dog fighting scenes, this is definitely not an action-oriented film.

As they wonder into and around an abandoned house, they decide to visit another house not too far away. As they do, they are brutally murdered by a large man in a leather face mask for no reason what-so-ever. The film proceeds with about 20 minutes of chasing through bushes and long grass with the reving of a chainsaw.Disappointing I've heard so much about the film, how it's shocking, scary and amazingly violent. Nonsense. When i began watching i expected an amazing film which completely ran all over the genre of Horror and created a new genre. All this hype was stupid an unnecessary. Sometimes i laughed at how poor it was.Repetitive and boring The chasing. So much chasing in pitch black, so you're unable to see anything but some light. This chasing goes on for over 10 minutes at least.. With screaming, and the non-stop sound of the chainsaw revving.. That's when i got very bored. After that, yet more chasing happened and long scenes of nothingness repeated themselves.So? What is good about it? The first 15 minutes or so are entertaining.. When they pick up a crazy hitch hiker. I won't give it away, but i think you may laugh at it.I can't imagine how the horror fan could like it at all either. I can't imagine how this film can still have the fame today that it had many years ago. It just simply doesn't work.

It's an epic film that wasn't afraid to be graphic. It's amazing these days how many movies are big, violent, and loud, but it's all just so light. With the exception of Braveheart and a few others, most movies that aim to portray realistic, pre-gun action fall way short and become comic books. Not that graphic violence is something to be glorified, but if you're going to make a movie about barbarians it should have the elements that director John Milius poured into Conan.Essentially, Conan is set apart from the other sword movies of the 80's due to its relentless, almost sadistic bloodletting. The gore, the splattering blood, gratuitous nudity, male dominance, orgies, murderous religious cults, sex slaves, belly dancers and giant snakes all made up for a fine cinematic experience. It is basically the ultimate hunter-gatherer film. Not necessarily celebrating all of these things, but just saying it's possible the world was just this crazy at some point in the past.James Earl Jones' absolutely creepy performance as Thulsa Doom is a classic role. John Milius took the bombast and brutality of the source material and transferred it onto screen nicely. The musical score is also one of the most amazing you'll ever hear. From the first moments at the beginning credits with monstrous drums beating over a Nietzsche quote, it's very powerful stuff.Arnold has always done pretty much the same thing, but he does it very well in this one.

","genre":"Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"23 June 2004","score":"13 out of 16 people found the following review useful","review":"  THE SANDLOT is quite possibly one of the best family films ever made. In it, a young, studious, unpopular boy named Scotty Smalls (Tom Guiry) moves to a suburb just before school lets out for the summer, and concurrently has a hard time making friends. He frequently sees kids playing baseball in a sandlot in his neighborhood, and wants to make friends with them. He figures the best way to do this is to join in on their baseball games--but alas, Scotty has almost no baseball skills, while the other kids are very experienced and good at the game. One day, the neighborhood hero Benny (Mike Vitar) approaches Scotty and asks if he'd like some pointers and to join in on their game. Scotty agrees, and slowly improves, while making friends with the other boys in the neighborhood.But one day, Scotty foolishly takes his stepfather's baseball autographed by Babe Ruth and knocks it into the adjacent backyard. This backyard, as Scotty is informed, is home to The Beast, a monstrous dog that, as legend has it, ate the only other boy who was daring enough to go after a baseball in that yard. The boys devise a plan to get the ball back, one way or another.I watched THE SANDLOT several times growing up, and remember always loving it. When I watched it again recently, I realized exactly why--it's a great movie. Just the right balance of childhood innocence and experience is captured, and this movie is bound to make any adult remember his childhood and all the different aspects of it. The summertime atmosphere and almost all of the scenes are terrifically nostalgic. Some of the scenes involving The Beast are hilarious, and everything has a nice familiar feel to it. It's a wonderful feel-good film.All of the actors put in at least average performances. Most of the child actors are just okay, with a few exceptions. Tom Guiry is good as the awkward and naive Scotty, as is Patrick Renna as the outspoken and witty Hamilton. I think the real standout of the actors, though, is Mike Vitar as Benny. He was excellent as the kindhearted, but still very cool hero of the neighborhood, the guy that everyone loved. He showed real promise, and it's a shame that he didn't continue with his acting career. The cameos from James Earl Jones and Denis Leary are also nice.I always loved watching THE SANDLOT growing up, and now I remember why. It's a great family film that is very entertaining and enjoyable to watch. I'm sure I'll watch it again years from now and remember just why I loved it. 8\/10.

The rhythm and pace is more like a sitcom than a feature film, sharply edited and light on its feet and with a sort of whitebread jazz motif loitering in the background, but the cast is certainly above average, and Mamet's screenplay is very charming punctuated with some funny sub-plots and a few very good (maybe even great) one-liners.The story concerns a film production crew, running out of money, who blows into the quaint provincial town of Waterford, Vermont on a location shoot after getting run out of New Hampshire (for reasons that are very hush-hush). The wellspring of much of the humor is in the byplay between the corruptness of the film people and the purity of the locals, who turn out to be as rotten as some of the Hollywood crowd. There are also some hilarious insides on the world of show-biz and film-making (i.e. the associate producer's credit, the product placement for a dot.com in a movie set in the 1800's, the cinematographer who can't get the shot he wants, Sarah Jessica Parker's character who finds religion and won't show her breasts in the film - unless the producers pay her an additional 800 grand).Mamet is not quite in the Woody Allen class of gagwriting, but he proves to be assured and witty without being too self-consciously clever (as he is in Heist). Some favorite lines I remember my lines. I just don't remember which order they come in.; You don't like children, do you? Never saw the point of 'em.; and, of course Whatever happened to 1975?William H. Macy gives a good funny performance as the wheeler-dealer director (as good as his work in Fargo or The Cooler), and Philip Seymour Hoffman and Rebecca Pidgeon are wonderful as the would-be lovers. This is a not great, but a good middlebrow satire of different worlds, very pleasant and expertly written, though just not savage enough to be brutally memorable. 3 *** out of 4  ","genre":null},{"date":"23 June 2004","score":"14 out of 18 people found the following review useful","review":"  In the pantheon of David Mamet's films, I'd say State and Main ranks somewhere in the middle, but it's a good middle.
