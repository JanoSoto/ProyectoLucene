The first time I sat through it, I -- like most of you -- felt it was WAY over-rated. But, for some odd reason, it seemed to get better and better every time I watched it! The cast is excellent, the music is outstanding, and Wes Anderson has definitely redeemed himself for his previous flop, Bottle Rocket. The plot of Rushmore may be a tad trite (a young student and an older man have a crush on the same teacher), but any possible cliches are made up for with fabulous direction and sizzling dialogue. And, to make it even better, Bill Murray gives the performance of a life-time that -- although ignored by Oscar -- has won the acclaim of viewers and critics alike. Murray is not the only star of the film, however Olivia Williams is perfect as the teacher stuck between a rock and a hard place, and Jason Schwartzman is an equally talented new-comer as the most extra-curricular student you have ever seen. These performances have all been mentioned before, but the one that appears to have been greatly over-looked is Mason Gamble's as Dirk Calloway (who later starred in the Jeff Bridges thriller, Arlington Road). True, it is a very minor role, but it is also very rare that such a young actor can grasp and understand it to this extent. Another great accomplishment in this feel-good flick is the screenplay, which was written by director, Wes Anderson, and rising star, Owen Wilson. It is full of laugh-out-loud lines like  MAX I like your nurse's uniform, guy. PETER These are O.R. scrubs. MAX Oh, are they? and MAX My father's a neosurgeon. Personally, I could never see myself cutting open someone's brain, but he seems to enjoy it. How can you compete with stuff like that?

I say Balto. You can see where we diverge?The movie (Balto, not Dead Poet's Society) is really good. Better-than-good. Superb and outstanding, and maybe better than those, too. It's a shame that it's so poorly-known, because it's very easily superior to the Disney fare it competes with. The animation is spectacular, and it's backed with Horner's astounding score. The voice talents are good, which means that the acting is good also. And their ears are drawn so very nicely...It's also got a great story. You've got your Beautiful Female archetype, and your Evil Nemesis archetype, and your Trusty Sidekick archetype, and the beautiful female is quite beautiful, and the evil nemesis is quite evil, and the sidekick is quite trusty. It works out well.Now of course we know that the movie will have a happy ending; this goes without saying, given the historical context. Please don't deprive yourself of viewing the film simply because of that. No, no. It's well worth watching, because the characters are well-developed and well-portrayed, because the animation is gorgeous, and because the story is true if not to the history books, than at least to the heart.Which brings me to this if you've researched the actual facts behind Balto's story as much as I have, or even quite a bit less, you will know that the movie doesn't do much in the way of being historically accurate. This is really very irrelevant.In adapting a story like this, you have to take liberties with reality. For example, Balto talks. Also, it seems he is more handy with his paws than I am with opposable thumbs. My dogs are not like this; this is an example of reality being traded in favor of story-telling. The end effect is marvelous. It's well worth that tradeoff. And, it's why I say that Balto is the greatest movie of all time.In reality, Balto didn't sound like Kevin Bacon, the Serum Run wasn't done by a single team, and Nome wouldn't have seen the sun in January. So what? It strikes me that reality would not have come through with a film as wonderful as Balto. So if you hear nothing else I say, let me leave you with this thought Balto is the greatest movie of all time. Believe me. I spend a lot of time with younger folks; I think I've probably seen every animated film ever made, and it's better than all of those. I spend some time with an older crowd too, and I've seen a fair bit of the cinema geared towards the more mature. But Balto has every movie that I've ever seen beat. Hands down, period, no contest.On the surface, it's a well-animated children's movie, which is sure to captivate those children as much as it has me, for all forty or fifty times I've seen it. When one sees it with the benefit, perhaps, of a little bit more maturity, one becomes aware of a very, very good movie, one that asks you to reflect on everything from love, to courage, to the way we see the world.So it's not simply a movie for children, it's a movie for all ages. There are parts that you can best appreciate if you're five, and parts you can best appreciate if you're five or ten times that age. But you can't appreciate them at all if you don't watch the movie, which is really what you ought to be doing now. It's what I'm going to go do now.So go!

Although MARY POPPINS is my all-time fav Disney movie, this film still has my merit.  When I bought the film on DVD a couple of years ago (and it had been 6 or 7 years since I last saw it), I begin to see why it's been ranked as a disappointment and now totally ignored in the Disney canon.  I'll begin with the performances. Singer Helen Reddy seems ideal in the title role, and her singing is absolutely wonderful...but in terms of her acting she is just OK. If anything, she certainly much better than most singers turned actresses (B. Spears is a perfect example).  As Dr. Terminous, Jim Dale is a lot of fun---and seems to having fun---in his role, despite the criticism by many critics of his and his co-stars tiresome mugging.  However, he and Red Buttons are perfect on the level of as acting as turn-of-the century con artists (years later, Dale played The Duke in a version of Huck Finn for TV!).  Then there is the always wonderful Mickey Rooney who, admittedly, mugs wayyyy too much, though at least he doesn't get annoying.  Then there is Shelley Winters who, and I don't care what anyone says, is a genunine trip as Mrs. Gogan. Sure, she maybe doing little more than scenery-chewing, though she does do it well.  Finally, last but not least is Sean Marshall as Pete.  As for his character, he supposed to be the center of attention next to his pet dragon Elliott.  My theory has always been is that it is too difficult to judge child actors, simply because they are young and experianced.  If anything, he certainly looks the role, though it is true he cannot sing at all. Next, is the score and songs, which were both nominated for Oscars.  I agree completely with an earlier reviewer, who said that they were good songs that were poorly staged.  Most of the songs I actually love, and would sing to anyday.  The music that opens up the film against a painted background of the setting is just wonderful.  The first song, The Happiest Home in these Hills is great in introducing the Gogan family, and how much b.s. they are full of--lol, well, anyway, I love it...and the two dim-witted sons still make me laugh when they sing their dialogue.  The song between Elliott and Pete is sweet on the surface, but it is the one I least like. I think the best song overall is Reddy's Candle on the Water, which perfectly emphasizes how good of a singer she is.  Then there are the three delightful numbers Every Little Piece, Brazzle Dazzle Day, and Bill of Sale (the funniest in my book). Also, one aspect of the film nobody has hinted on is the period detail, which I admit is minor, but for this film is impossible to ignore. The film is set in turn-of-the-century Maine, and everything down to the set to the costumes is absolutely first rate, and give the film a realistic atmosphere.  The scene is the tavern, in particular,  looks astonoshingly real.  As for the animation, it wasn't anything new for the time (in comparison, this animation looks flawed next to MARY POPPINS and BEDKNOBS & BROOMSTICKS).  However, for the time at least, its still fine...in fact, its done by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman, who later left Disney and did such wonderful films like SECRET OF NIMTH, LAND BEFORE TIME, and AN AMERICAN TAIL.

Everything you've heard about the special effects contained in this are absolutely true. They are magnificent, and succeed in putting the viewer right into the heart of the battle.

These have got to be some of the most realistic war scenes ever put together by Hollywood. The second half rates an 8\/10.A couple of casting notes are in order. Dan Aykroyd as the naval captain who is also the crack decoder just didn't work for me, and Jon Voight - who played President Roosevelt - simply did not capture the part. Overall - no better than average performances, even from the leads. So, let's see. A 2\/10 for the first half, and an 8\/10 for the second. That averages out to 5\/10 - and that seems right to me.

The first hour and a half or so is all about the love story between Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale). The most generous thing I can say about this is that it is excruciating. The romance is never really fleshed out. It appears almost out of the blue and seems to move in a stuttering way that doesn't make a lot of sense. I didn't think there was much chemistry between Affleck and Beckinsale, or for that matter between Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett, who played Danny - Rafe's best friend and eventual rival for Evelyn's love. Too cliché, and the reason for the conflict between Rafe and Danny is too contrived. This first half gets a 2\/10.

Yet another failed attempt at hip-afying character dialog that is totally inane and out of place in the first place.

Powerless to stop them with the relevant three letter access code the President of America and his advisors plan to warn Russia as best they can to prevent as many of the planes reaching their targets as possible.  However when the Russian Ambassador warns of the doomsday machine &#150; a machine that will destroy all life on earth in response to a nuclear attack things become desperate.  With one plane making a desperate run to it's target things look bleak.Now well respected as a superb satire on the arms race this is one of my favourite Kubrick films.  It is less cold than some of this later work and is genuinely funny without losing it's point.  The story focuses on three main areas of the attack &#150; the military base where one crazed man launches the attack, the war room at the pentagon and the plane making the bombing run.  All these have comedy inherent in them &#150; although thew war room is by far the best.  The story is an satire on the futility and danger of the nuclear deterrent while also scattered with fantastic dialogue.  It may not sound funny but trust me &#150; it is.The characters are all great and well done by the cast.  Peter Sellers excels in each of his roles and shows his quality.  As Mandrake he is funny in a very British way, as The President he has great one sided conversations with his Russian counterpart as well as great dialogue including the legendary `Gentlemen you can't fight in here &#150; this is the war room'.  However as Dr Strangelove he is hilarious &#150; the character himself is a swipe at those who change political sides but maybe still hold onto their old ideologies.  Sterling Hayden is great as General Ripper &#150; he delivers his madness with a straight face throughout (or maybe no-one told him it was a comedy!).  Slim Pickens is good and has the most famous scene from the film that has been copied in many things including Homer's fantasy in The Simpsons.  However for me the standout is George C. Scott &#150; not exactly a comedy actor he is frantic and over the top with his communist paranoia.Overall this is a classic and deserves to be.  It is sharp today as it was then and even more relevant.  The comedy is still fresh and the dialogue is great &#150; quite simply, when Scott implores the president to act quickly as `we must not have a mineshaft gap!' then you've arrived!

The story focuses on three main areas of the attack &#150; the military base where one crazed man launches the attack, the war room at the pentagon and the plane making the bombing run.  All these have comedy inherent in them &#150; although thew war room is by far the best.  The story is an satire on the futility and danger of the nuclear deterrent while also scattered with fantastic dialogue.  It may not sound funny but trust me &#150; it is.The characters are all great and well done by the cast.  Peter Sellers excels in each of his roles and shows his quality.  As Mandrake he is funny in a very British way, as The President he has great one sided conversations with his Russian counterpart as well as great dialogue including the legendary `Gentlemen you can't fight in here &#150; this is the war room'.  However as Dr Strangelove he is hilarious &#150; the character himself is a swipe at those who change political sides but maybe still hold onto their old ideologies.  Sterling Hayden is great as General Ripper &#150; he delivers his madness with a straight face throughout (or maybe no-one told him it was a comedy!).  Slim Pickens is good and has the most famous scene from the film that has been copied in many things including Homer's fantasy in The Simpsons.  However for me the standout is George C. Scott &#150; not exactly a comedy actor he is frantic and over the top with his communist paranoia.Overall this is a classic and deserves to be.  It is sharp today as it was then and even more relevant.  The comedy is still fresh and the dialogue is great &#150; quite simply, when Scott implores the president to act quickly as `we must not have a mineshaft gap!' then you've arrived!

Set in high-school, high-school aged Peter Parker (played by Pleasantville's Tobey Maguire) is having enough troubles in his life - his Uncle Ben is killed and he lusts after Mary Jane Watson (Dick's Kirsten Dunst) - without having to save the citizens of his city! But a mysterious Green Goblin explodes onto the screen - ahem - scene to rain on Spidey's parade by destroying anything and anybody that gets in his way!To be honest, I wasn't even going to bother with the big-screen experience of this film simply because Spider-Man was never a favourite superhero of mine (I liked the Batman phenomena much more!) but I'm glad I did! The visual effects are nothing but spectacular - each shot of Spiderman swinging from building to building from his silk-web-rope stuff is superbly choreographed and executed. The fight sequences and stunts are amazing to watch, while the hopeless romantics who view this will love the storyline between Parker, Mary Jane, Harry and Spider-Man. Also, the scenes in which Peter is trying out his new-found powers are extremely charming and funny.Now, onto the performances. The not-so-obvious casting of Tobey Maguire in the lead role was an inspired idea. The fact that he's not a conventional Hollywood leading man works to his advantage. Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn\/Green Goblin is great both in and out of costume while his son Harry, played by Freaks And Geeks star James Franco is good as Peter's best friend, although his character is a little stereotypical. Kirsten Dunst (who is just getting better and better) is wonderful as Spidey's love interest Mary Jane, despite the fact that for the 2 hours the film runs for we see her have strong feelings for a milestone four guys (OK, so 2 are the same person, but she didn't know this!). The charismatic high-school couple share great chemistry and hot up the screen in a particularly memorable scene where he rescues her from 5 thugs in the pouring rain.Overall, this is a truly inspired comic-book to silver screen movie. Not since the first two Batman movies has a superhero film come as close to perfection as this (although admittedly, X-Men wasn't far off!). No doubt there is a sequel already planned and scripted - but that's definetely OK by me! 8.5\/10.
