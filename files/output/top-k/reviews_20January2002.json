The box art was compelling, looking like the cover of an issue of Vault of Horror from EC Comics and promising(From the looks of it) extreme carnage and violence.This was not so. Not only were the first couple minutes lopped off(which were already only barely explaining the plot's beginning) but much of the gore as well. Viewers were left with a watchable film but without the gore that the video box promised- thus alienating the main viewership- namely gore hounds. Others only knew the movie through reputation, and may have picked it up through curiosity.Fortunately, what was once relegated to crappy bootleg video transfers is now available on video and an excellent DVD edition, and The Beyond, as it is known in its uncut glory in the USA, is now accessible.Enough history.The film itself, as I said, does not explain much of the plot. What we see is a man painting a picture- it looks like a dark landscape with dead bodies laying around. A group of men break into his hotel room, drag him into the basement, and whip him with chains, nail him to a wall, and throw a convenient bucket of acid in his face(I heard this was some sort of limestone-remover or something. I would be worried about getting it on my hands if I were to scoop it into a small bucket and throw it in someone's face!). They obviously disbelieved the man's warnings that the hotel was(gasp) built over one of The Seven Gates of Hell(tm)!That about wraps up any storyline as far as why the gate is opened. So what's the real story? Why did the gates open? Was this so-far unnamed painter some human cork, plugging the gate? Was his death simply hideous enough to open the gates in and of itself? Or did he mumble some sort of prayer to the dark powers, a spell of some sort, and open the gate at the moment of his death?I don't know. I always assumed it was just the horrible nature of his death. The men called him a warlock, but the film never reveals whether this was true or whether they were just superstitious because of his weird paintings- which was my original assumption, but he *did* know about the gate! On the other hand, the hotel was called the Seven Doors Hotel or somesuch, so I guess it couldn't have been all too secret.We learn later that the man was named Sweik, because one woman(a ghost in fact) cries out to him for pity right before she gets her throat ripped out, in an only somewhat-convincing scene(yeah, the director was known for gore, but never really made it look all that real, except for two now-legendary scenes from Gates of Hell, which was something of a 'Part One' to this film).So all in all the plot is not the driving force. The driving force is gore, fear, weird happenings, shock, and gore. Maybe I repeated myself, but it was intentional.The whole movie revolves around simply weird things that happen in a haunting. The whole film, while not heavy on character developmet, plot, or even decent dialogue is very heavy on one all-important thing in Italian horror cinema atmosphere.And Fulci knew *that* area well. No matter if the movie didn't make much sense or the gore was silly. The film *still* gave you a dark feeling of growing dread, or at least a feeling like you needed a shower. And that's horror!Italian horror films revolve so much around atmosphere that the movies come off less like an ongoing story and more like an unraveling nightmare. Especially The Beyond, of all Fulci's movies. Of Fulci's 'big three'(which consists of this film, The Gates of Hell aka City of the Living Dead, and Zombie aka Zombie Flesh Eaters aka Zombie 2) The Beyond is most successful as an entertaining movie. Gates of Hell was all gore, but much of it was tiring(about three people died in the same way) and boring. Zombie had nice makeup effects but the main attraction, a scene in which a woman gets a wooden splinter into her eye, is very easy to see through- you can tell exactly how it was done, and that's a bad thing when it comes to gore. Zombie had a more sensible storyline than Gates, but Gates, had an eerie story and atmosphere in its own right.Enter The Beyond. The film was not as creepy an atmosphere throughout much of it as Gates or Zombie, but the pacing outshone both. Although Beyond didn't have the famous gore scenes of the other two, it did have a higher all-around gore level, although it still suffered from some of it looking fake(you can't help but wince at a scene of tarantula's eating a man's face, although you can still see the glue from the prosthetics being stretched as the pieces are ripped off).This review is quite wordy already so let me cut to the end as fast as I can. the Beyond has some flaws- the plot is not fully explained, and there are some silly mistakes. Why did Liza find the bloody nails in Sweik's old room when he was crucified in the cellar? Do Louisiana homes even have cellars(I don't think so)? Indeed, why did the gates re-open when she moved in- was Sweik waiting for someone to move in, or is it as silly as some people say(that the plumber knocking the wall down opened the gates- I mean, come on, the zombies in the film can teleport! Who cares about a wall?).Despite these problems, The Beyond is a true nightmare scenario which jumps about from horrible scene to spooky scene to weird scene to horrible scene to nonsensical scene to horrible scene. The needed thing isn't to ignore the plot- it's to build on it yourself. Why are these things happening? If you fill in the gaps yourself, you can come up with a sensible answer that you can debate with your friends. A horror movie that can start a debate- wow.Answers? Debates? What about the ending? I don't want to give away the ending, but the ending is quite interesting if you look closer. You can turn off the VCR and say The ending was (whatever) and never think about it again. Or you can think- what really happened? Was it a descent into the beyond? or madness? what happens now? they become like Emily? or they make their own hell? There are lots of questions to ask, and lots of debates. I think Fulci was smarter than people credit him for with this ending. Which is a place where the other two films fail. Gates of Hell had such a lame ending that it practically ruined the movie. One explanation was that someone dropped acid on the film and the visuals for that ending were lost. Whatever. Even the ending, if it hadn't been burned, was lame. And the ending for Zombie was obvious. I *liked* the ending, but they could have tried to make it a little less guessable. The ending to The Beyond, however, was well-paced, well shot, the 'scenery' was great and you really couldn't see it coming(or maybe I'm just bad at guessing endings).So what it amounts to is this If you can watch a movie without being spoonfed all the answers; if you love watching films with atmosphere as much as plotline; if you like violence and can overlook if it looks fake sometimes; if you like nightmare scenarios; and if you'd like to see what is hailed by many to be the best film of who is hailed to be one of the best Italian horror film directors of all time, check out The Beyond. I'd skip Seven Doors of Death if I were you- get it uncut. You could even make it a double feature with Gates(it will probably be listed as City of the Living Dead).I will stop the review now, as it is already long enough. If the above sounds like you, stop reading reviews and just check out The Beyond.

This film was uninspired garbage, tied up in a gory bow of violent scenes every 15 minutes, and topped off with terrible acting by all major characters.  This film has recently been called the best of the year and grossly the best film ever.  Anyone person of sane mind,who has the ability to look past the sweeping landscapes and the horrific makeup, can clearly see that this movie has little to offer.  The movie opens up with a basic epic voice-over like in many films before it, giving you an overview so the audience doesn't get confused, as most people in the audience would not have the brain power to figure it out for themselves.  Then the ametuer director, Peter Jackson, feels the need to rub New Zealand's flowing landscapes in the face of every person viewing the film.  This was the major weapon from this director and it was selfish use of film.  Then the character casting was horrible, you have the kid from Radio Flyer, the one pretty boy from 28 Days, and lets not forget Rudy. Ian McKellen gave a below average performance, which is suprising from a man who has such film history.  This would prove to be small potatoes by the time the movie ended.It is hard to explain how much the end of the movie made me mad.  Or should I say the anti-ending.  This may look unique in the eyes of cinematic idiots, but it was just unnerving.  The ending was not an ending, it was an extended pause until next year.  If you gave me the production value that they got, I could have gotten all three books in three hours and still be true to the story.  The ending was not there.  Most films have endings. This was just a film that stopped.I have proven my case and now you take it or leave it, but I know that this is probably the most hyped movie of the year, and most likely the worst.

This film was uninspired garbage, tied up in a gory bow of violent scenes every 15 minutes, and topped off with terrible acting by all major characters.  This film has recently been called the best of the year and grossly the best film ever.  Anyone person of sane mind,who has the ability to look past the sweeping landscapes and the horrific makeup, can clearly see that this movie has little to offer.  The movie opens up with a basic epic voice-over like in many films before it, giving you an overview so the audience doesn't get confused, as most people in the audience would not have the brain power to figure it out for themselves.  Then the ametuer director, Peter Jackson, feels the need to rub New Zealand's flowing landscapes in the face of every person viewing the film.  This was the major weapon from this director and it was selfish use of film.  Then the character casting was horrible, you have the kid from Radio Flyer, the one pretty boy from 28 Days, and lets not forget Rudy. Ian McKellen gave a below average performance, which is suprising from a man who has such film history.  This would prove to be small potatoes by the time the movie ended.It is hard to explain how much the end of the movie made me mad.  Or should I say the anti-ending.  This may look unique in the eyes of cinematic idiots, but it was just unnerving.  The ending was not an ending, it was an extended pause until next year.  If you gave me the production value that they got, I could have gotten all three books in three hours and still be true to the story.  The ending was not there.  Most films have endings. This was just a film that stopped.I have proven my case and now you take it or leave it, but I know that this is probably the most hyped movie of the year, and most likely the worst.

That's all I could say, it is just brilliant and surpasses every war film ever made. It features the best and most realistic battle scenes ever put on film. If everyone remembers how well Saving Private Ryan did with the message of War is hell you will certainly realize how good and how straight forward Ridley Scott is with the same message. As I was watching this film about a failed mission that was supposed to last only an hour but at the end it was near the 16 hour mark, I really got to care and respect each and every character despite the lack of character development. I got to know each character as the movie went one therefore character development would have been pointless because as I watched these guys get killed I felt a tremendous amount of emotion for each character.Why? because I got to know them as soldiers before the battle began. I didn't need the whole life story in order to appreciate these guys. Moving on, I do want to point out that this film is very violent and features probably the realest and most graphic scenes ever. You see open wounds and you see men with there legs blown off. If you have a weak stomach I advise you to turn away during these scenes because they are like I said very graphic. Another thing to remember if your a parent is this If you must see this movie make sure you find a sitter because it is NOT for kids... I recommend this film to any adult that enjoys war films and film making at an all time best. It's very emotional and very touching. An unforgettable experience.

The scenes, at times incredibly life-like, are shot with outrageous depth and scale; missiles seem to come right out at you from the background, shots of helicopters feel so close you almost feel you're there, inside, and of course, a whole lot of bloody injuries, gunshot wounds, and lost limbs to bring it all home.The reasons for why the US found itself there are presented in terse fashion, the historical component being largely set up in the opening few minutes of the film, including on-screen comments explaining the situation leading up to the loss of American lives.  After this point though, what we get is a highly stylized get to know the characters session, with a lot of male bonding and competitive angst between Army Rangers and Delta Force team members.  After thirty or fourty minutes, I feared the worst for Blackhawk Down, it was looking like, despite Ridley Scott's involvement, it might seriously fall victim to the typical Bruckheimer shlock element seen in Pearl Harbor, Armageddon, etc.  I just didn't need the fluff, the male bonding-Top Gun testosterone crap.  What would have been good is a serious treatment of the political blunders and foreign policy conundrum that led up to the events.  But then, just when I let out a sigh, the fighting scenes kicked in and, almost as if the makers of BlackHawk Down knew it was precisely the right time to shift gears, I get swept up in the action.  If you've seen Private Ryan, you have some idea of what level of graphic violence Blackhawk down presents.  This film banks on its audience desiring action over answers, death of documentary, and it delivers.  Scott's direction, as usual, is fantastic.

Blackhawk down's war scenes could have been from any of a number of wars past and present.  Obviously, it does bring back into focus the tragedy that befell our American troops in Somalia a decade ago.  And the timing, of course, couldn't have been better.

I complained about the special effects, but I read about how much trouble the filmmakers went through to get this movie finished. One thing though that still stands as something I dislike is one, the mistake in the end of having Nuclear Man fly Lacey Warfield up into space and two, the fight on the moon. There are some good moments in the moon fight, but Superman acts like a wimp in some parts and doesn't know how to fight. He stomps on Nuclear Man's foot, he takes Nuclear Man's head and brings it into his knee and he tries to kick(tap) Nuclear Man and it results in Nuclear Man throwing him. But one last thing about the scene that I love is how Superman walks over to the American flag and stands it back up. Great stuff. There are only plot holes in the movie because a lot of it was cut because of idiots in Orange County that didn't like it. Thanks to them we have a movie second rate to the original version.

First of all I like Tolkien's work very much. I read LOTR twice and The Hobbit once. In my opinion there's nothing wrong with making a movie from the book, so I went to see the first movie, and I had high expectations, having read so many positive comments about it on Internet and newspapers. Anyway, I had an open mind OK, many beautiful scenes will not be there (Tom Bombadil, etc.) and it probably will not be able to fully capture the atmosphere of such an huge masterpiece, but, well, I have the chance to finally SEE one of my favourite stories on the screen, as imagined by someone who, as everybody say, loves LOTR and had tried to be as faithful as possible to Tolkien's wonderful work! I went to theater with my girlfriend. She never read LOTR, so I gave her a short intro myself about the story to help her catch as much as possible, then the movie began. The intro was fine, given the time Jackson had to work with. Stunning effects, cinema, battle coreography. Good explanation of the ring's story. I felt even more excited at what was coming next. My girlfriend was interested. The Shire too was well portrayed, actually even better than I had portrayed it in my mind reading the book, I thought. Amazing! But, when Frodo and Sam leaved, the movie began to sink. I started to feel uneasy when Merry and Pippins appeared. They were... obnoxious. Incredibly stupid and childish. What? They aren't so! As I already said, I was prepared to the cutting of the ancient forest and Tom Bombadil; painful, but you can't have everything in three hours and it would turn the movie into something like a musical. OK, but... why Jackson loses so much time with the dark knights instead of better developing the characters? Why he doesn't show the knights only once from far away, without contact, for example, just to introduce the real danger and build tension? You had a battle during the intro, you'll have more later! Brea episode is overly simplified but not so bad. I understand the reasons behind the amplified Arwen's role, but why Jackson didn't shrink, for example, the attack where Frodo is wounded? I mean, show quickly the wounding by only one knight, almost easily defeated, for example, and give extra time to the Elrond's Council, which is one of the most important episodes of the trilogy, if not THE most important one! And please, use things like X time later... here and there to show better that the Council takes place a lot of time after the hobbits' departure from the Shire! What about the wizards' battle? Why? Cut even the Caradhras episode telling something like it would be impossible in that season to walk through the mountains, or Saruman made it impossible, if you absolutely need more time to well develop the story! Lothlorien is more important and there are only few minutes to show what happens there! Shrink the battle in Moria before the Balrog appears (the best monster I've ever seen, BTW)! I don't know, but you have choices! I could go on and on, but this comment is already too long. Constraints also  here! ;-) The point is that I feel Jackson didn't choose well what to cut. He filled the movie with action and thrilling episodes, even more than in the book (think to the wizards' battle or the creation of the Saruman monsters), simplifying everything else and rendering the characters almost like phantoms (think to Legolas) or caricatures (think to Merry, Pippins and partially Gimli). The movie is a dark-heroic-war-action-thriller full of unanswered questions about people appearing here and there like  mushrooms.All in all, and I'm very sad to say that, boring. Simply boring. My girlfriend was p****d off when we walked out the theater and I felt very embarrassed. I doubt she'll read the book now. I tried to rebuild the magic of the Tolkien's creation I had talked about before, but probably this movie made too much damage.This is not LOTR. This is something else and I don't like it. The acting is acceptable (Gandalf, Bilbo and Saruman more than acceptable), given the script. 9\/10 for effects, coreography, landscapes... 4\/10 for the atmosphere, the characters, the script (more important things in a movie, at least for me).

And please, use things like X time later... here and there to show better that the Council takes place a lot of time after the hobbits' departure from the Shire! What about the wizards' battle? Why? Cut even the Caradhras episode telling something like it would be impossible in that season to walk through the mountains, or Saruman made it impossible, if you absolutely need more time to well develop the story! Lothlorien is more important and there are only few minutes to show what happens there! Shrink the battle in Moria before the Balrog appears (the best monster I've ever seen, BTW)! I don't know, but you have choices! I could go on and on, but this comment is already too long. Constraints also  here! ;-) The point is that I feel Jackson didn't choose well what to cut. He filled the movie with action and thrilling episodes, even more than in the book (think to the wizards' battle or the creation of the Saruman monsters), simplifying everything else and rendering the characters almost like phantoms (think to Legolas) or caricatures (think to Merry, Pippins and partially Gimli). The movie is a dark-heroic-war-action-thriller full of unanswered questions about people appearing here and there like  mushrooms.All in all, and I'm very sad to say that, boring. Simply boring. My girlfriend was p****d off when we walked out the theater and I felt very embarrassed. I doubt she'll read the book now. I tried to rebuild the magic of the Tolkien's creation I had talked about before, but probably this movie made too much damage.This is not LOTR. This is something else and I don't like it. The acting is acceptable (Gandalf, Bilbo and Saruman more than acceptable), given the script. 9\/10 for effects, coreography, landscapes... 4\/10 for the atmosphere, the characters, the script (more important things in a movie, at least for me).

In my opinion there's nothing wrong with making a movie from the book, so I went to see the first movie, and I had high expectations, having read so many positive comments about it on Internet and newspapers. Anyway, I had an open mind OK, many beautiful scenes will not be there (Tom Bombadil, etc.) and it probably will not be able to fully capture the atmosphere of such an huge masterpiece, but, well, I have the chance to finally SEE one of my favourite stories on the screen, as imagined by someone who, as everybody say, loves LOTR and had tried to be as faithful as possible to Tolkien's wonderful work! I went to theater with my girlfriend. She never read LOTR, so I gave her a short intro myself about the story to help her catch as much as possible, then the movie began. The intro was fine, given the time Jackson had to work with. Stunning effects, cinema, battle coreography. Good explanation of the ring's story. I felt even more excited at what was coming next.

The fact that Ridley Scott was directing was exciting enough, but the fact that this was about the 1993 battle in Moghadishu, Somalia was all the more reason to see this.  I vividly remember Somalis dragging our dead shirtless soldiers through the street like they were a piece of meat and was thoroughly p***ed off by that.  Many in the press at the time called that a failure of our special forces, which I did not buy; I thought that our special forces did well, but it's the men in Washington (especially Clinton) who messed up.Before seeing this movie, I saw Lord of the Rings and thought that that was one of the only movies of 2001 worth seeing.  I now have to place Black Hawk Down in this category as well.  This movie captures everything about the hell of war as well as US intervention in other countries.  Yes, we can make similarities to Private Ryan, but this movie hits closer to home because a. it speaks about the type of war we are now used to (guerrila warfare), which really doesn't have a winner and b. the fact that we are facing a current war now.Most films on war so far have dealt with the conventional war that we are used to seeing.  A possible exception may be Platoon, about the Vietnam war, but I really count that as a conventional war because we had a defined enemy.  This movie, on the other hand, deals with an unexpected confrontation with an enemy that really had no face--a true guerrila war. The movie spares nothing to the imagination.  I myself felt lost in parts of Moghadishu with the soldiers; the film makes you relate with what it was like to try to find your way to a downed helicopter while having to fight an enemy that you couldn't really see or identify.  What is was like to be forgotten and find your way to your company in a mindfield of people who were after you.  What it was like to see people you worked with blown apart by rockets while having to fight the faceless enemy.  I could go on, but I'll let you see the film instead.  I was also surprised by the fact that they did show the dead american soldiers being dragged through the streets, and quite frankly, as disturbing and sickening as it was, I'm glad they did to show how chaotic it was.And the best part of the film is that none of this is glorified.  We are not seeing Rambo blowing the Somalis to smithereens while he never sustains a scratch and able to escape a situation with his brute strength.  We instead see and feel what it is like to fight a real war and be pinned down, even when you are the best of the best.  I give a lot of credit to Ken Nolan (screenwriter) and Ridley Scott for not venturing into Hollywood territory. Ridley himself wanted to make this film a documentary, and has done a beautiful job at doing that.  I was almost scared that it would when I saw that Jerry Bruckheimer was producing the film.As for the cast, excellent job by all.  Yes, Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor, and Josh Harnett are in it, but as far as I'm concerned, they did their job; they made me believe that they were the soldiers fighting this war.Now let me deal with some of the criticism I have read about the film. Some have said that it doesn't allow for characterization.  I think that is thorough B.S.  Watching this film, you ARE with the Special Forces\/Delta Force, and though you won't remember the names of all the characters in the film, that works to the film's advantage because to us, they are any Tom, Dick, and Harry that we know on the street, not some superhuman commando portrayed by a faux hero like Arnold.  We empathize more with them. Second, some will say that this movie is racist because it shows black guys fighting against white guys.  Hey, this isn't the US; it is Somalia, and everyone there is black.  And most of the special Forces were indeed white (from what I understand, only 2 of the commandos were African Americans, and one is portrayed in this film).I say that this should get at least a nomination for best picture and best director, if not win in these two categories.Finally, this movie should be recommended viewing for the entire public and especially to the beauracrats in Washington; the beauracrats should know what it's like to send our forces into an area that they barely know and into a war that is not ours.  I never blamed the troops for what happened; they were just doing what they were ordered to do, and they did it superiorly in the situation they were in.  Instead, I blame draft-dodgers like Clinton for putting them in such a hot situation without thinking things out.I've always had respect for our men in armor, and this movie is a testamen t to those who put their lives on the line for their country.  God bless the 18 soldiers who left us and the United States Armed forces.

The fact that Ridley Scott was directing was exciting enough, but the fact that this was about the 1993 battle in Moghadishu, Somalia was all the more reason to see this.  I vividly remember Somalis dragging our dead shirtless soldiers through the street like they were a piece of meat and was thoroughly p***ed off by that.  Many in the press at the time called that a failure of our special forces, which I did not buy; I thought that our special forces did well, but it's the men in Washington (especially Clinton) who messed up.Before seeing this movie, I saw Lord of the Rings and thought that that was one of the only movies of 2001 worth seeing.  I now have to place Black Hawk Down in this category as well.  This movie captures everything about the hell of war as well as US intervention in other countries.  Yes, we can make similarities to Private Ryan, but this movie hits closer to home because a. it speaks about the type of war we are now used to (guerrila warfare), which really doesn't have a winner and b. the fact that we are facing a current war now.Most films on war so far have dealt with the conventional war that we are used to seeing.  A possible exception may be Platoon, about the Vietnam war, but I really count that as a conventional war because we had a defined enemy.  This movie, on the other hand, deals with an unexpected confrontation with an enemy that really had no face--a true guerrila war. The movie spares nothing to the imagination.  I myself felt lost in parts of Moghadishu with the soldiers; the film makes you relate with what it was like to try to find your way to a downed helicopter while having to fight an enemy that you couldn't really see or identify.  What is was like to be forgotten and find your way to your company in a mindfield of people who were after you.  What it was like to see people you worked with blown apart by rockets while having to fight the faceless enemy.  I could go on, but I'll let you see the film instead.

His involvement in Black Hawk Down more than cancels out anything director Ridley Scott might have been able to make out of it.Black Hawk Down is the story of the disastrous US raid-gone-wrong in Mogadishu, Somalia, in the early 1990's. The story itself is extraordinary, and the book by Mark Bowden is much more exciting than the film, which ought to tell you something.As for the actors - who cares? With so many actors, an incredibly small amount of time is spent in what should have been crucial set-up, so we neither know nor care about the characters, and most of them are reduced to fake two-dimensional stereotype caricatures (a Bruckheimer hallmark).Horrible, trite dialog which you see coming a mile away and is just embarrassing to hear come out of anyone's mouth (another Bruckheimer hallmark).One of the soldiers calls his wife just before mounting up for the mission, and leaves her a sappy message on the answering machine, and she walks in and picks up the phone just as the soldier hangs up, missing his call. Any guesses on what's gonna happen to THAT guy (another Bruckheimer Hallmark)? Put a classic Star Trek red shirt on him, for god's sake.Much of the combat scenes are very well done, but the movie is plagued with horrible editing, both visual and sound. Many times a character speaks words with his mouth way out of sync with what we hear.Music score by Hans Zimmer's California corporate music factory excellent. Superb version of classic English hymn The Minstrel Boy over closing credits.Crowd scenes very well done, something which modern movies regularly screw up. The extras portraying the Somali savages really did a great job, were very well-drilled and choreographed, and looked very believable.And for the usual nit-picking criticism - major continuity errors throughout the film. My favorite A column of US Hummvees is driving through the streets of Mogadishu, and we get a great shot from the top of one of them, clearly showing the Hummers mounted with M60 machine guns atop each. Cut away to side shot, and all the Hummers are mounted with M2 heavy-barrel machineguns. A small thing, but when you spend that much to make a movie, and it is one which is going to be viewed and analyzed by military hardware fanatics, one which you'd better freakin' well get right - especially if you're charging us $8 to see it. For those of us who AREN'T military hardware fans, an M60 is a Viet Nam era weapon which almost everyone would recognize... and an M2 heavy barrel machinegun is a WWI era weapon still in use. The two are totally different and look nothing alike.In all it's generous to score Black Hawk Down a 4 of 10. I would say wait for it on video if you're going to see it at all, but then the film's only powerful impact - the battle scenes - would be greatly diminished. So maybe a dollar movie?
