[{"date":"30 March 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" DISTURBING BEHAVIOR (1998) has an interesting premise that is well-executed the first half, but falls totally apart in the second. On the surface a teen flick, it has all the standard elements cliques, peer pressure, angst, crushes, etc. Two groups vie for the attention\/control of the 'new kid in school' Steve Clark (played by James Marsden). Frankly, I was thrown off by Marsden as I found him to be a bit too mature (age-wise) to be convincing as a green teen! Steve immediately is befriended by school rebellious school outcasts Gavin (the scene-stealing Nick Stahl) and Rachel (a Goth-looking Katie Holmes). Marsden is noticeably older than both Stahl and Holmes, both of whom at this time were actually teenagers, so I was a bit thrown off with him playing a teen.Stahl actually delivers the best performance in the film, and carries it for the first half, then disappears for a significant part of the second half (there is a reason!). Marsden tries and shows signs of good acting, but he wasn't given much to work with and is essentially playing the typical interchangeable hero part. Holmes fares much worse as she is rather unconvincing as a Goth chick! Her character is pretty much lifeless throughout. Other than Stahl, the most interesting characters are teen loser Andy (played gleefully by Tobias Mehler) and the weird school janitor Dorian (an over the top, enjoyable performance by William Sadler). The usually reliable Bruce Greenwood's gets stuck in the cliché role of the town villain, replete with fake mustache to PROVE that he's evil!The first half is very disturbing and combines elements of mystery, horror, and teen drama. The mass teen weirdness is relayed very slyly and creepily to the viewer and it really looks like the film is going somewhere! But once DISTURBING BEHAVIOR strips away subtleties and reveals the plot, it gets dull very fast! It ends up being very predictable and devolves into a typical 'the whole town is evil' flick!I think that the film wanted to be a satire on societal conformity and individuality, but the final act plays like a zombie-horror flick with rather unconvincing 'action' scenes and some very cheesy moments and bad acting! The very end of the flick is exactly what I would expect in a dime-a-dozen horror flick, which this movie ends up being!

With the exception of The Colour Purple he was known as a director of big-budget B-pictures. Many people criticized his films for being too syrupy and child-like. With the notable exceptions of Duel and Jaws this wasn't necessarily an unfair assessment. While his vision was unerringly on the pulse of the mainstream, it rarely had any edge whatsoever. So with the release of Schindler's List, Spielberg was able to offer something pretty bleak and hard-hitting. He was also rewarded at the Academy Awards, which was another thing he craved desperately.The book by Thomas Keneally from which the film was adapted is a masterful and deeply disturbing account of true events in Nazi occupied Poland. It takes a documentary approach to events, as it is all from real accounts. It was, therefore, the sort of novel that had to be treated with the utmost respect if it was to be translated to the screen with any success. It has to be said that Spielberg was largely very successful in this challenge, and his film remains a powerful telling of this most harrowing, if ultimately uplifting, of tales. He wisely decided to film it in stark black and white which lends an immediate bleakness to proceedings and recalls old footage from the Second World War. When he does decide to inject a bit of colour, as in the little girl in the red coat, it works in bringing out the appalling tragedy of this little girl's life even more &#x96; it doesn't seem gimmicky. Another major plus for the film is in the performances. Liam Neeson has the right blend of charisma and humanity as Oskar Schindler but best of all is Ralph Fiennes as the camp commandant Amon Goeth; he played this character with extreme skill and brought to the screen a strangely complex presence. I certainly wouldn't go as far as to say Fiennes's Goeth was sympathetic &#x96; he was vile &#x96; but his underlying impulses and insecurities had interesting depth to say the least.On the whole Spielberg handles things very well here. His trademark schmaltz is thankfully absent, and he does not hold back when he needs to ramp things up and show atrocities. Quite often Schindler's List is very unpleasant, and the director wisely doesn't sugar-coat things. The only place where he breaks is in Schindler's closing speech at the factory. This moment was melodramatic and totally unnecessary. The events depicted up to that point had been faithfully told from a historical point-of-view and they did not need that invented moment of emotional manipulation; what had gone before spoke for itself. This minor slip-up aside, Schindler's List did prove that Spielberg was capable to making serious films when he put his mind to it.

In order to find him, the group has to go thorugh hell, just to make sure that Ryan is found and sent back home.This movie may be disturbing to a lot of audiences, especially the first 30mins, even I was not prepared for that kind of action when I first watched it on the big screen. It looked almost real, and I could feel what the soilders felt when they were part of the 2nd World War. There are some moments that will make you puke and there are some moments where you will cry.I will give this movie a full rating, because it deserves it.
