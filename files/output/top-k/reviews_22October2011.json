But as criminals as they are, they are stuck with this last ounce of humanity giving a meaning to their lives. So let's get this straight, if you're among the kind of cinematic fans with a particular revulsion towards gangsters, this film is not for you, all it will inspire is the kind of demagogic comments such as good riddance, all these low-life bastards deserve their fate. But if you're interested by the torments invading the souls of these underworld humans, prepare yourself for a disturbing and dark journey into Mafia's hearts of darkness.It's interesting that the central character is played by Christopher Walken, the actor had always an extraordinary combination of mental instability and charismatic aura in his eyes, the kind of man you don't know if it's safe to approach or to avoid him, in both cases, you respect and fear him. But now, we're in this man's soul at a pivotal moment in his life, when he's trying to determine, during the funeral of his brother Johny (Vincent Gallo), not what the meaning of his life is, but how he can live with himself with his personal idea of justice and the satisfaction to do something ethical. Yeah, I see where you're coming from, how can I ever use the word 'ethic' for criminals? Well, ethics refers to a code, to some behavior that doesn't necessarily take the law as a reference, and from that point, anything is debatable. And when the movie says anything, it sure means it, as even God is concerned.Although the movie is set during Catholic funerals, the first thing that strikes is the amount of blasphemous rants during the discussions. These men don't believe in God, but they don't sound atheists, it's just as if they had a proud reaction over a religion that casted them out anyway. So if they haven't been touched by the divine grace, which could have inspired them to be good people, so why do they have to blame themselves? If everything is due to God, why should they feel guilty? And now, if it all is a matter of free will, and decision, then what makes their acts more condemnable? Any idea of justice is no better or no worse than another &#x85; the thought-provoking script invites us to feel an existential empathy toward these men, as if it tried to explicit all the dilemmas that fill the heart of criminals. After all, they have hearts, haven't they? To label them as only cold-blooded murders is another trick to avoid questioning our own approach to evil.But whatever rationalization it tried to inspire, the counterpart of this thinking relies on the female characters, the wives, who endure the machismo of their husbands and try to figure what the purpose of all this is. Why and how have criminals, killers, fooled them? Some scenes between Annabella Sciorra and Isabella Rosselini suggest a sort of female bonding, as a reactive defensive process from the kind of fusional relationship between the brothers Christopher Walken, Vincent Gallo and Chris Penn -Rest in Peace, Chris, this was your finest performance as the most mentally instable of the three brothers- Never voyeuristic, these scenes of female intimacy where the discussions are intelligently combined with great metaphysic references, translate the lack of morality and belief innate to that cruel male world, and how it can hardly be expressed except in the confinement of a little bedroom. The whole confinement of The Funeral, in its setting, is crucial here. There is a cloud of lucidity floating in the air, as if the film trusted our intelligence, by not showing men trying to find excuses, but on the contrary, men extremely lucid about their fate. This is what the whole claustrophobic setting of the film is about, it's an extrapolation of the coffin, symbolizing the whole fate of the family in microcosm. These men are in a dead-end, and they know it damn well. During a heart-breaking scene between Chris Penn and a young prostitute, refusing to deprive her from her innocence, he pays her for not having sex, she asks for the double to have sex with him, provoking an incredible outburst of rage. She'll get paid twice the price then pushed against the wall and assaulted as a punishment for having sold her soul to the devil. This scene brutally reflects these men's understanding of their own conditions  they sold their soul, they know they'll never see the paradise. In other words their lives are only a suspended sentence to hell. They don't believe in God, but they don't deny His existence either.So, when it can't get any better, the best you can do is to make it better according to your own codes. And this is the constant disturbing feel of the film, men trying to act according to their sense of justice, their morals, trapped between their humanity and their evilness. Again, Abel Ferrara doesn't invite us to feel empathetic toward gangsters, as sometimes, the movie indecently flirts with some stereotypes to better remind us, the world lying beneath that sober and familial atmosphere. The Funeral reflects the affection of true funerals  a profound introspection in order to understand the value of goodness and humanity, because once you put your foot in the dark side, you can't go back, and it doesn't try to fool you with a sort of quest of redemption bullshit. They're grown-up men, and their life IS dead-end. To a point you wonder if the title Funeral refers to one man or three souls. The Funeral is an extraordinary, dark and disturbing journey, that will simply wow you at the end &#x85; so you better get ready.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"22 October 2011","score":"","review":" The Big Sleep is a classic detective movie in the film noir style. My friend claims that this is the best film ever made. I wouldn't go that far, though it is tempting, but this movie I believe is a work of art. There are actually two versions of this film, one where the plot is clear while the actual 114 minute version in which the relationship between Phillip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) and Vivian Rutledge (Lauren Becall) is emphasised. It is this second version that was released and it is the more popular version. Unfortunately the plot does suffer, but I will try to outline what actually happens.Marlowe is summoned by a rich general because his daughter is being blackmailed. His former detective has left town so the general must turn elsewhere for help. Marlowe accepts the job and trails the blackmailer Mr Geiger who is murdered. The case is closed and Marlowe is paid, but he knows there is something deeper. The general's younger daughter is at the house and at Geiger's bookshop, which is really a front for a pornography ring, some guy is cleaning out the rear. All the evidence points to this guy, but as Marlowe digs deeper he learns that it is not, and this guy is shot before he can get anymore answers. This then leads Marlowe to follow up Geiger's landlord, who also runs a gambling house. Unfortunately the motivation for the murder is lost, and the plot is claimed to be so twisted that the original author of the book simply says, the butler did it. The Big Sleep is about appearances and keeping yourself shut of from the world. All of the conversations within the movie seem to have two layers. There is the visible layer yet there is another layer which is trying to undermine the recipient of the conversation. Though guns are deadly in this film, and a number of people are killed, it is the art of conversation which creates the powerful people in the film, and Marlowe is one of the most powerful.All of the main characters in the film have a dark, flawed side to them. Marlowe was described by one person as being incorruptible, but I disagree; this issue is not raised in the film. We know there is a dark side to Marlowe, but he hides it very successfully. We know that he is covering himself out for he only lets Vivian in a little way even though there is a electric passion between them. We do know that Marlowe was sacked from the District Attourney's office due to insubordination, but beyond that we have no clue as to who or what he is.Marlowe is a loner. He works by himself and lives by himself. He does start to form a relationship with Vivian, but this is a shallow relationship where both parties try to protect themselves from their secrets, and this is displayed as the best one can get. The Big Sleep is noir so the dark side of humanity does play a role. The movie is not a tragic movie, but there is a lot of senselessness in it. The death of the guy tailing Marlowe is seen as being a pointless death, and it is one that constantly sits in Marlowe's mind. We constantly are reminded about the brutality of the death because he was a good kid. Marlowe met him only once, but that one meeting was enough to let him know that the kid was harmless. Thus Marlowe makes the death of Geiger's landlord just as pointless. We know that he is behind everything in the movie, but at this point Marlowe is not interested I answers, he simply wants to see the guilty pay for their crimes, and they do.The ending of the Big Sleep is not conclusive, and I don't think it is meant to be. Everything is chaotic and twisted and we have trouble following what is really happening, and I feel that this is the purpose of the movie. Everything moves through the movie quite fast, and we will arrive at a point where we think everything has been resolved only to find we have gone off in the wrong direction. In the end, the frustration simply rises to the point where the games end and the shooting begins, yet all the while Marlowe's hands remain clean, he's just been shot by his boys, Marlowe says on the phone.Even then, Marlowe is a master manipulator. Throughout the movie, Vivian's Younger sister Carmen does not know who he is. The name he first gives her is not his real name and she persists with this name right through. Yet he sees through to he flirtatious nature and misleads her with the name because he knows anything between them is simply going to be just as misleading. The phone scene to the police station is just as manipulating as Marlowe turns the call from being a report of a crime to a crank played against the police, but this phone call is also reveals that Vivian is not a lady that is going to be led around by Marlowe. She has resolve and will stand up to Marlowe when necessary.The Big Sleep is a superb movie which vividly portrays the darkness and the chaotic nature of this world. It is one where the characters protect themselves, yet are revealed to be vulnerable, and it is one of deceit and manipulation. Blackmail is rife and people will pay up rather than bring about police involvement. Murder is common yet brutality has a price. It is a superb movie and worth every minute of it.

We know that he is behind everything in the movie, but at this point Marlowe is not interested I answers, he simply wants to see the guilty pay for their crimes, and they do.The ending of the Big Sleep is not conclusive, and I don't think it is meant to be. Everything is chaotic and twisted and we have trouble following what is really happening, and I feel that this is the purpose of the movie. Everything moves through the movie quite fast, and we will arrive at a point where we think everything has been resolved only to find we have gone off in the wrong direction. In the end, the frustration simply rises to the point where the games end and the shooting begins, yet all the while Marlowe's hands remain clean, he's just been shot by his boys, Marlowe says on the phone.Even then, Marlowe is a master manipulator. Throughout the movie, Vivian's Younger sister Carmen does not know who he is. The name he first gives her is not his real name and she persists with this name right through. Yet he sees through to he flirtatious nature and misleads her with the name because he knows anything between them is simply going to be just as misleading. The phone scene to the police station is just as manipulating as Marlowe turns the call from being a report of a crime to a crank played against the police, but this phone call is also reveals that Vivian is not a lady that is going to be led around by Marlowe. She has resolve and will stand up to Marlowe when necessary.The Big Sleep is a superb movie which vividly portrays the darkness and the chaotic nature of this world. It is one where the characters protect themselves, yet are revealed to be vulnerable, and it is one of deceit and manipulation. Blackmail is rife and people will pay up rather than bring about police involvement. Murder is common yet brutality has a price. It is a superb movie and worth every minute of it.

Nick has some good friends and a loving girlfriend and a great idea for a simple movie. He is also very innocent and naive and basically is chewed up by the Hollywood machine and spat out.The movie reveals how the Hollywood dream is not that great, and it is only through luck that Nick actually makes it. In the film there is another guy who did not win a trophy but he seemed to have made it big. Nick believes that he has made it as well, and quickly leaves his old friends for his new ones. It also seems that Alan is prying Nick away from his friends and setting him up with Hollywood friends, such as the actress Gertrude.Suddenly Alan Hale is axed and all of his projects are canceled. Nick finds that he is now untouchable and left in the streets with not money and no friends. He slowly watches how everything is taken away from him and reminded out how big a dream he really had. His former landlord claims that he was a director that was spat out, as if making it harbringer of things to come, and then reminded when he is applying for a job as a waiter, that everybody wants to make it big in Hollywood.It is only fortune, and a bit of vision, that brings Nick back. He runs into an old school college that introduces him to a band that wants to make a video, and he does. At that time he is trying to rebuild his relationships. It is interesting to see how pessimistic Nick is because he is always expecting the worse and getting the best. His ex-girlfriend threw him out yet when he came to her again she welcomed him, and even visited him again. His old Camera-man friend whom he had let down, was still welcoming to him and said, I was always your friend. This contrasted the people he had met at Hollywood, who were his friends when he was big, and dumped him when he had lost it all.This movie is good, and has a fantasy feel to it. The cinematography creates a more dreamlike world, but it is a dream where the good becomes bad and is only restored through some fortuitous move. What this movie shows me though is who one's friends really are. His true friends remained his friends while his Hollywood friends only spoke to him when they wanted something.

Rather, I find that I do enjoy his movies, especially Airheads, and this movie was no different.In 1962 there was a little crisis called the Cuban Missile Crisis, and a paranoid inventor took his pregnant wife into a bomb shelter, just before a plane smashed into their house.

Where in the first movie, Bill and Ted travelled through time, here they travel to heaven and hell and experience what it is like to be dead, and in their words it is bogus and most unheinous. Where as in the first movie everything was really good, this movie, everything is really bad. Like the first movie, they end it with a huge concert but this one is somewhat heaps better as Bill and Ted fight the bad guys and win as their opening to battle of the bands. Chuck De Nomelos (Joss Ackland) is one cool bad guy. Martin Erbert, who liked this movie, said it was as thin as ice and as light as a feather. The comedy is quite like that, light and funny and in my opinion, quite good for American Comedy (which I tend not to like). As for being thin, I don't think so there is numerous things that one can think about in this movie, as in any movie. This movie deals heavily with the afterlife, looking at both heaven and hell. Bill and Ted go to hell first and when they escape, they then go to heaven. The classic quote here is our album covers lied to us! The filmmakers have created a hell which is not nice. Many of us consider hell to be a wild place where we can do what we like and not suffer any consequences for it. Heaven is boring and dull and hell is fun. In Bogus Journey, hell is not fun, far from it. The first thing we see are people screaming to be let loose. Bill and Ted go deeper in and find that they will spend eternity going over all of the bad things that happen. They manage to escape though. This helps move the story line for they must get home and save their fiances. The thing is that in reality, once you are in hell there is no escape. Bill and Ted were lucky, we will not be so. Heaven is really interesting as well. It is a beautiful place where everybody enjoy themselves. The imagery in interesting when they enter as all who pass through the gates. Heaven here is much better than Hell, and God is a really nice guy, as Ted comments after God helps them in sending them to Station. The problem here is that Heaven is portrayed as a place where all the good people go. It is not a place where only those who believe in God and follow Christ go, but rather a more liberal version. This movie is different, but in essence the same. They go on a very strange metaphysical journey and finish off with a great show. The difference is is that they have opponent directly trying to stop them from succeeding.

The reason I say that is because they both die and come back to life, the travel to hell and then to heaven, but they also defeat Death and bring him under their power. As death says when they ask him to take them somewhere 'you have beaten me &#x96; I am yours to command'. Further, they end up becoming a pivitol point on Earth's history and change the direction that it is heading, and to finish off, they ascend into heaven, in the sense that they leave Earth to go and play on Mars. While this is all quite interesting, what this tends to show us is that we as a culture are still looking forward to the coming of somebody to make everything all better, when in reality that person has already been, and while we need to still look into the future, we also need to look back to the past to see what has already been done.

I have a differing opinion on this matter if we take the movie purely on its visuals, and even on the action, then we loose a large part of what this movie is about. Ebert's comment on the unrealistic nature of Tyrell's death is unimportant for if one is concerned more about how the replicant got into his office then you have missed the entire point of this scene.The original release was not how Ridley Scott wanted the movie. I thought the original was boring but the Director's Cut (1993) has turned the entire style of the movie around. Ford's dubbing has been removed, there is an extended scene with the love affair between Ford and Young, and the ending has been changed completely. The original ending has Ford and Young driving off through a lush green countryside with their eyes on a beautiful future. The other ending is far bleaker with the words It's too bad she won't live, but then again who does, A very existentialist ending, which really is the whole point of the movie.Blade Runner is about life, death, and the nature of humanity. Six replicants, advanced, genetically engineered robots, have escaped from their offworld colonies and have come to earth to confront their maker, Tyrell. The reason they come to Earth is because they have had a limited life span, four years, built into them, and they are reaching the end of their life. The whole purpose of this reminds us that we are all destined for the same end, and the point of the movie is that there is no way to end it. The close is superb for there is no huge gun battle where Roy (Rutger Hauer) goes out in a blaze of glory, but rather just dies because his time is out. Scott uses a dove in this scene as a possible symbol of the ascension of Roy's doll. In the end we are reminded that we all die. No dream world where the good live forever and punishment for evil is to have this eternal life ended. But then this dream world is not so fantastic after all for we all fall short of the glory of God, and as Romans 311 says there is no one who is righteous, not even one. There is no one who does good, no one who understands, all have turned away, together we have become worthless. We are all evil thus we all die the wages of sin is death. There is a very interesting idea in this movie though, about the nature of humanity. The ascension of the Roy's soul is a suggestion that there is more to the nature of the replicants than just a simple work tools. The idea is that these replicants are in a way more human than we are. There is a suggestion that Decker (Harrison Ford) is a replicant. We are not told directly but hints are dropped, like one replicant saying to him that he will live longer than him, and also the nature of Rachel. She is a replicant with a full memory implant. As far as she is concerned she is a human, and as far as Decker is concerned he is human. Also notice that there seems to be a glint in the eyes of the replicants.

Ebert's comment on the unrealistic nature of Tyrell's death is unimportant for if one is concerned more about how the replicant got into his office then you have missed the entire point of this scene.The original release was not how Ridley Scott wanted the movie. I thought the original was boring but the Director's Cut (1993) has turned the entire style of the movie around. Ford's dubbing has been removed, there is an extended scene with the love affair between Ford and Young, and the ending has been changed completely. The original ending has Ford and Young driving off through a lush green countryside with their eyes on a beautiful future. The other ending is far bleaker with the words It's too bad she won't live, but then again who does, A very existentialist ending, which really is the whole point of the movie.Blade Runner is about life, death, and the nature of humanity. Six replicants, advanced, genetically engineered robots, have escaped from their offworld colonies and have come to earth to confront their maker, Tyrell. The reason they come to Earth is because they have had a limited life span, four years, built into them, and they are reaching the end of their life. The whole purpose of this reminds us that we are all destined for the same end, and the point of the movie is that there is no way to end it. The close is superb for there is no huge gun battle where Roy (Rutger Hauer) goes out in a blaze of glory, but rather just dies because his time is out. Scott uses a dove in this scene as a possible symbol of the ascension of Roy's doll. In the end we are reminded that we all die. No dream world where the good live forever and punishment for evil is to have this eternal life ended. But then this dream world is not so fantastic after all for we all fall short of the glory of God, and as Romans 311 says there is no one who is righteous, not even one. There is no one who does good, no one who understands, all have turned away, together we have become worthless. We are all evil thus we all die the wages of sin is death. There is a very interesting idea in this movie though, about the nature of humanity. The ascension of the Roy's soul is a suggestion that there is more to the nature of the replicants than just a simple work tools. The idea is that these replicants are in a way more human than we are. There is a suggestion that Decker (Harrison Ford) is a replicant. We are not told directly but hints are dropped, like one replicant saying to him that he will live longer than him, and also the nature of Rachel. She is a replicant with a full memory implant. As far as she is concerned she is a human, and as far as Decker is concerned he is human. Also notice that there seems to be a glint in the eyes of the replicants.

Well, it is nothing more than a pulp action film with the redneck Jack Burton (Kurt Russel) stumbling in on a plot were Asian girls are kidnapped and thrown into brothels. What sets it apart from other movies, in my opinion, is that its use of magic, action, and that fact that Jack Burton is an outsider who really only wants his truck back (and the money that he is owed). This movie pits the average tough guy hero up against supernatural forces, and really this hero just bumbles his way through the entire movie; there is nothing about Jack Burton that makes him anything special. He is a simple truck driver who thinks he is tough but deep down he is not.Big Trouble in Little China has special effects and lots of action, but it is also laced with humour in the character of Jack Burton. He is the centre of the movie, but really the problems could have been solved with out him. Yet when one looks at the character of Jack Burton, one notices that he has something that the others do not have, and that is guts. The guy is willing to stick his neck out to take on forces that are much more powerful than he. His stubborn streak is a part of this for he refuses to believe that there is any of this supernatural stuff going on around him.

The main theme of this movie is what defines humanity, and can a robot be a human, even though it was created by a human.The movie is about a robot who journey's for two-hundred years to become a human. At the beginning he is a servant in a house, and it is discovered that he is unusual, that is he has a creative streak, but not only that, he also has the capacity to think. Through-out that time he comes to understand the concept of freedom and is given things that only humans have had, such as bank accounts and money. He then begins to change his insides to that of a human, and in the end he gives himself blood and thus causes himself to degrade as a human does. During this time he also falls in love and loves as a human does.The movie does not deal with his understanding of death, as it is concluded quite quickly that he knows what death is. Instead he knows about it all ready. Instead he comes to understand human emotions and what it means to be human. At first it deals with him looking like a human and having the rights of a human, but in the end he realises that to be human, he must die. As such, upon his death bed, he is finally proclaimed a human.From what I know of the book (as I have not read it) the battles deal more with him begin legally declared a human. This exists in this movie, but the legal battles occur infrequently, and the movie deals more with his understanding of himself, his relationships with others, and his desire to be human. This desire isn't evident at the beginning, but when he begins his search for his destiny, he soon comes to desire to be more human. In fact, upon meeting Porscha, the grand-daughter of his favourite Little Miss, he desires to become even more human. In fact, he not only takes a central nervous system, but he gives himself the ability to die along with the one he loves.In the end, this movie is very sentimental and emotional. It is idealistic and is the type of movie that one would watch with one's partner. It is sort of a love story, but moreso it is an idealistic, sentimental movie with a happy ending not really the style that I like. It deals with the character much more that what the character is trying to do. It looks at him inside rather than those looking in at him. He is making himself human as opposed to humans declaring him human.The one problem is where a robot commits euthanasia. The first law of robotics is that a robot may not harm, or allow a human to come to harm. The second law is that a robot must obey a human. The question is whether euthanasia is allowing a human to come to harm. In fact it is harming, but is turning off a machine allowing a human to come to harm?

It wasn't really something that I wanted to see and now that I have watched it, I don't really think that it is really that much of a movie. When it was in the cinemas, the Greater Union cinema on Hindley Street was in two buildings, one on each side of the street. One must think that this movie isn't all that good because I am talking about the layout of Adelaide at the time that it was in the cinemas. The movie was average, it is just this is what the movie brings back to me.Goldie Hawn is an interesting actor, interesting that I don't actually think that she really suits many of the roles that she is cast it. Hawn is simply just too innocent. She seems to be a lot like my friend Mellissa, she is sweet looking and not really suitable for a woman who has been through divorces and bad husbands. If only she could act and even look more cynical and disillusioned she might suit the roles that she is cast in (okay I am talking about Foul Play and this movie). The role is not all that bad because the character is supposed to be sweet and innocent, dragged into the action that is beyond her, but her background just doesn't reflect the character. I would have had Hawn's character still sweet and innocent, and still mourning for the lover that she lost so long ago. Maybe she could be married but a divorce is just too messy and too emotionally destructive to create a sweet and innocent character.Bird on a Wire, that title just didn't really make much sense to me. That is probably why I thought the movie was simply average. Sure there were stunts, machine guns, explosions, but the title simply did not capture the essence of the movie. It was also a chase movie, where a couple are chased across America by evil government officials, which is reasonably clichéd. I think to make a good movie now we need to fall into the area in which our music is drifting we need to turn away from the happy fantasy to the hopeless, empty, and bleak existence that life is. Homer Simpson says to the Smashing Pumpkins, I thank you for your bleak music for you have stopped my children dreaming of a future I simply cannot provide. Our music is tearing down the fantasy world that we have put up before us, and I feel that this is where our movies need to go.Well, I have talked about this, and we must remember the time of the movie. Bird on a Wire was late eighties and the bleak world view was only just forming. Nirvana had appeared in the early nineties, about two to three years after this. Metallica had released And Justice For All, and Iron Maiden were singing Ballards while Guns and Roses were hard rock. This was a time that the world was beginning to collapse but the dream that was the eighties was still flowing. I was employed as an electronic technician and things were nice. It was a time when movies of hope and innocence existed, yet they still do, though I must see Armageddon to really see how movies of hope exist, while movies like City of Angels seem to suggest having to give something up to love.I still haven't talked about what Bird on a Wire entails, but I guess it is not really all that important. Simply it is a chase movie. A young man, Rick, flew over to Mexico to buy some cheap drugs but was caught by corrupt DEA officials who forced him to smuggle drugs back into the States only to get caught at a private airstrip. He testified and was put on witness protection but the DEA officer was recently released and is now after him. At the same time his ex-girlfriend, the one he left standing at the altar, sees him in Detroit and this thrusts them together. It is interesting but rather plain.

That is probably why I thought the movie was simply average. Sure there were stunts, machine guns, explosions, but the title simply did not capture the essence of the movie. It was also a chase movie, where a couple are chased across America by evil government officials, which is reasonably clichéd. I think to make a good movie now we need to fall into the area in which our music is drifting we need to turn away from the happy fantasy to the hopeless, empty, and bleak existence that life is. Homer Simpson says to the Smashing Pumpkins, I thank you for your bleak music for you have stopped my children dreaming of a future I simply cannot provide. Our music is tearing down the fantasy world that we have put up before us, and I feel that this is where our movies need to go.Well, I have talked about this, and we must remember the time of the movie. Bird on a Wire was late eighties and the bleak world view was only just forming. Nirvana had appeared in the early nineties, about two to three years after this. Metallica had released And Justice For All, and Iron Maiden were singing Ballards while Guns and Roses were hard rock. This was a time that the world was beginning to collapse but the dream that was the eighties was still flowing. I was employed as an electronic technician and things were nice. It was a time when movies of hope and innocence existed, yet they still do, though I must see Armageddon to really see how movies of hope exist, while movies like City of Angels seem to suggest having to give something up to love.I still haven't talked about what Bird on a Wire entails, but I guess it is not really all that important. Simply it is a chase movie. A young man, Rick, flew over to Mexico to buy some cheap drugs but was caught by corrupt DEA officials who forced him to smuggle drugs back into the States only to get caught at a private airstrip. He testified and was put on witness protection but the DEA officer was recently released and is now after him. At the same time his ex-girlfriend, the one he left standing at the altar, sees him in Detroit and this thrusts them together. It is interesting but rather plain. I had more fun sorting out my photos.

As such the movie was written along the lines of the original intentions of Neil Simons rather than the interpretation of a third party. Even so, I quite enjoyed this movie namely because of its wit and decent characters.Biloxi Blues is about a young man in 1945 who is going to boot camp to train to fight in the war. This is in the closing stages of the war so moral is very high because of the fact that they are on the winning side. The war is only in the background for the focus of the movie is not the war but the relationship between the platoon and the main character's entrance into adulthood. During the movie the main character sleeps with his first woman and also falls in love for the first time. It is his first time out of home and enters the boot camp as a naïve boy, but he leaves a man.Sergeant Tooley is the most interesting character in the movie. When he first walks onto the screen one immediately notices that he is different. The stereotypical sergeant walks on yelling while Tooley walks on greeting his platoon. He rarely raises his voice, and actually uses other cadets to dish out punishments, with the intention of turning the other cadets onto him. Thus he uses peer pressure to keep people in line. Yet as with most sergeants the cadets hate him, though after he is discharged they realised how great a sergeant he really was.The main character is very witty, and of course this angers the sergeant no end. His first comment on Mississippi is that it is hot, Africa hot, not even Tarzan can stand this hot. Or when he is asked what he would do if Japanese were marching on him, he would surrender simply so he could get a decent nights sleep, or even his religious holiday simply to get out of eating a horrid meal.I guess what made this movie really lively is that the narrator claims that it was based on his own experiences.

Fear in 1996 was a good addition, but since then we haven't had a decent one (The resident was the pits).It's a slice of early nineties cheese, especially because it's round about that time when the nineties was still trying to be the eighties, so the yuppie context coming from Russell is rife throughout.But him and Liotta are on fire here, and there is a little homophobic subtext between the two when they are bonding.The Ray gets a little out of hand and starts acting a bit freaky and Kurt blows a fuse. He gets framed for something he didn't do and due to him having all his cards cancelled cannot get bail to be with his wife.This is where the film goes a bit silly. Liotta kills his partner for the reason being that he's probably done this before (we never get to find out) and he's going to tell his boss.Then he cooks dinner for Stowe (who is excellent in this), knowing that she is freaked out beyond her mind. the man may be crazy, but i'm sure he' not stupid.The film then does the classic 'is he dead?' thing and before the payoff happens, Liotta has time to say something cool.The build up is fantastic, it's expertly made and looks like a lot of money has been thrown at it. The actors are all great and it's one of Hollywoods best Adult Psycho Thrillers, along with Pacific Heights, Single white Female, and anything Michael Douglas starred in circa 1987-1994.
