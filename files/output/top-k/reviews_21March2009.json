However, I tried to watch the movie unbiased, since even a failed adaptation might be quite enjoyable as a movie in its own right.Sadly, it wasn't.The movie had some (okay, maybe two or three) great scenes. Jeremy Northam (as Randolph Henry Ash) and especially Jennifer Ehle (as Christabel LaMotte) manage to convey intriguing characters, even with very limited time and dialogue. Too bad, though, that a movie revolving around two poets should contain so little poetry - Ash and LaMotte supposedly recognise each other as kindred minds and succumb to the power of each other's words, but what we actually see is just another pretty couple falling rather randomly in love. But whereas Northam and Ehle could still be quite believable as poets, Paltrow and Eckhart fail utterly as scholars. They do not say a single intelligent or scholarly thing. The only academic zeal they display is the occasional petty theft. They do not show any appreciation of their research subjects - Eckhart's character in particular seems too stupid to even copy-and-paste an undergraduate paper together, let alone to be the type of guy who would devote his life to the analysis of Victorian poetry. And I'm not even talking about the utter ridiculousness of Paltrow, with her perfectly plucked eyebrows and carefully applied layers of makeup, talking about her 'feminist sisters'. ...oh, Aaron Eckhart and his infuriating grin and pasted-on 'brashness' - how I wanted to punch him in the face. But I digress.Now and then, fragments of subplot can be discerned among the endless demonstrations of Paltrow and Eckhart's painful lack of chemistry. Mortimer Cropper occasionally pops up, but it is hard to tell why, since none of his brief appearances influences the main storyline in any way. (Apart from one of the final scenes of course, which I will not spoil, but here, too, he somehow conveniently disappears when it's time for Paltrow and Eckhart to steal the show again. They must have killed him off-screen, or something.) Also, a solicitor is introduced, but his function remains a mystery. The presence of these unnecessary elements is even more painful in the face of the absence of some much more obviously valuable ones - like Val, or Leonora. They could even have introduced an actual Roland, rather than two versions of Fergus Wolff! They could have used the time devoted to the useless solicitor by including some actual poetry!But, well, who needs poetry when we can have two pretty people kissing their way towards a cardboard happy ending?

The story is about a furniture obsessed guy, who had insomnia. He decided to form a club in which he could unleash all of his energy and finally be able to caught some sleep. But after a while, things went out of control, and nothing was what it seemed.People often tell me that I am too picky when it comes to movies. That pretty much nothing impresses me, that I don't like popular films etc. But after watching this kind of film it is difficult to be impressed by the average film.This movie set a new personal mark in this genre.

He hunts him down at a foster home and kills anyone who gets in his way.The first Child's Play movie was great, it was original and well done, and had moments made jump my heart jump out of my skin. But this time round it isn't as good or well done as the first movie but still passable. The storyline to this one is a lot weaker and the tension the first movie had isn't here this time round. But Chucky himself gets more screen time and more witty one liners which is a definite plus side to this movie.However the main characters in this movie aren't as interesting, we don't have Chris Sarandon or Catherine Hicks which is a shame, and the characters in this sequel aren't as well developed and so that makes the suspense watered down. Don't get me wrong this is still a fun flick to watch and better than some sequels out there, namely (Sleepaway Camp II, The Ring 2, The Grudge 2 etc), The Chucky puppet is way better this time around. He looks more evil and I loved that quick kicking he does every time he lunges on somebody. I didn't spot a midget in a suit in this entry. The kills are more creative and bloody (although the Joanne kill is a throw away&#133;she deserved better).Where the first one was more suspense oriented this one almost feels like a slasher flick. Gone is the humanity of the first or the novel storyline. Everyone is there so that Chucky could eventually have his way with them. This sequel is low on surprises but it's still good.Alex Vincent (Andy)is again a great young actor but his performance in the first one was a lot stronger than this time round. Christine Elise (Kyle) who walks through the movie never letting any emotions shine through. Nothing impresses this girl, not even a living doll!, but she shines in the final scenes as the main heroine this time around, Jenny Agutter (Joanne) has a sexy British accent and does what she has to do&#133;not much. Gerrit Graham (Phil) got on my nerves, he was extremely unlikeable and I was glad when he died and Brad Dourif (voice of Chucky) does it again, going haywire with his unique voice.All in all Child's Play 2 isn't bad, it's a really good flick in fact but it lacks the tension the first one had. Also look out for the death scene at school where the teacher gets whacked with a ruler several times, has to be the best death in this movie.

Yet watching The Abyss, I do not stop and feel as if what I'm watching has been ripped off. I just enjoyed every moment of it.The ensemble cast is well written and preformed. And while the script isn't as efficient as The Terminator, it holds some great moments of suspense and human drama lacking in that film.Sure the story ventures into redundancy. Sure there are too many endings. Sure it ventures into deep bellows of high cheese melodrama followed by happy ending nonsense only seen in a Spielberg movie. All these things I do not dispute. But every time Bud gets to typing after disarming the bomb and we see ..knew this was a one way ticket. it just gets me every time. And between the theatrical version or the extended cut, I easily prefer the theatrical one. The intimate and claustrophobic story in the theatrical version is a story I vastly prefer.

I'm used to seeing an older and more mature Quaid in films like Swimmer and The Express. Still he does do very well capturing the essence of Lewis as I remember him as a lad.The key to understanding Jerry Lee Lewis is in remembering that what he did in marrying those child brides was quite normal behavior from where he came from. Young girls in the more rural sections of the south frequently got married at 13 to 15 and the success rate wasn't any better or worse than in the more sophisticated parts of the country. I do well remember the scandalous stories back in the late Fifties that put a halt to Lewis's meteoric career. Lewis came back and of course never got quite the same success, but music trends change in any event. He's still doing well on the nostalgic circuit, playing more for the love of it than the need for money. Playing that honky tonk piano and singing meant more to him than the trappings of success.Winona Ryder got a big break in her career playing Lewis's notorious child bride Myra. Interestingly enough at the same time Lewis's stories were in the news, Errol Flynn at 48 escorting young adolescent Beverly Aadland was also making headlines.

Can she convince a sceptical police force of this psychic link, and how long before the killer comes calling for her ?I have a bit of a problem with movies which date badly. I don't mind if a filmmaker is trying to reflect the times (Sullivan's Travels, Easy Rider), or developing a specific visual style (The Maltese Falcon, Blade Runner), but when a movie is just full of stupid clothes, silly hairstyles and bad music, it often grates hard enough to spoil any suspense and kill the dramatic tension. This is a such a movie. The premise, from a script by a young John Carpenter, is interesting enough; as Laura starts to understand what's happening to her she tries to make some impact (albeit unsuccessfully) on events, and the fact that she's effectively rendered blind when the visions come is a nifty way of putting her in peril. It doesn't matter though, because her character is so aloof and such a scaredy-cat that it's hard to have much sympathy for her. When the maniac is finally at her door, the best she can do is scream, Go away ! - come on honey, get a grip. Also, the plotting is weak; we know chief suspect Dourif is too obvious a patsy and the denouement with Jones abruptly turning into some schizo lunatic with a deathwish is a classic case of the old hack's let's introduce a totally new element in the last ten pages maxim.

So don't think you can cram for tomorrow's Beethoven exam by watching this movie... your teacher will flunk you right out of the conservatory.But if you approach this film as a sort of conspiracy theory, and if you have a reasonable--but not too precise--familiarity with the facts of Beethoven's life, you will be very entertained, shocked and intrigued at the story.Real quick historical synopsis In papers found posthumously, Beethoven did indeed mention an immortal beloved, much to the surprise of the world which thought him to be a solitary soul. The identity of this person has vexed historians for centuries, and speculation has been the cause of many a knock-down, drag-out fight amongst them (those historians can be pret-ty feisty). Here we have a possible explanation which pulls together several interesting episodes from Beethoven's life and weaves them into a believable plot. The historians can duke it out whilst we can enjoy the show.Gary Oldman, as always, delivers a fantastic performance which elevates this film to classic status. Sure, there are flaws in this film, but nothing that cannot be overlooked in light of the acting and of course the music. My only gripe is that the film focuses very heavily on plot (and rightly so, I guess), but in so doing, it sacrifices the poetry of the situation. We rarely get a good, quiet, reflective moment where we can look into the tortured soul of the composer. Instead we get plenty of fiery episodes and situational drama, which is good but can leave us exhausted after a while.Contrast this with the film Amadeus which breaks up the action with carefully crafted monologues and time to breathe & reflect. Immortal Beloved can seem like a fast paced action flick compared to that--but again I suppose the complex plot demands it. This is really a minor criticism. Although Amadeus needn't worry about losing its place in my list of best movies ever, Immortal Beloved is certainly worthy of playing in the same league.

Instead we get plenty of fiery episodes and situational drama, which is good but can leave us exhausted after a while.Contrast this with the film Amadeus which breaks up the action with carefully crafted monologues and time to breathe & reflect. Immortal Beloved can seem like a fast paced action flick compared to that--but again I suppose the complex plot demands it. This is really a minor criticism. Although Amadeus needn't worry about losing its place in my list of best movies ever, Immortal Beloved is certainly worthy of playing in the same league.

It is actually very easy to write a story with Fritzl type movie with a larger then life conspiracy and a detective who isn't too clear and have no plan. In fact I find it a child's play to write movies where it raises too many questions and nothing can be done about it just to overwhelm the senses. One was that mysterious Hal malfunction in Stanlely Kubrick, although no answer was provided, that was provided by the movie 2010, and 2001 remains somewhat of a mystery. And to make it appear complex is actually easy then to make it simple in any scriptwriting work. While critically acclaimed, because of the secrecy and mystery surrounds the movie, it could be a complete opaque. In any event I don't like the movie because it drags, too mysterious and there's nothing you can do about the crime in Los Angeles. The pass the movie as something you just have to accept. I believe can be done about it, but the veil of mystery is gone. The movie explains nothing and writing this style of movie won't get a blockbuster, audiences and just bore someone to tears. The writing style such as this is also easy to do or imitate and this is not the kind of story writing I like other people to emulate either. It's sloppy work to have any story without a clear story or actions by the characters. It makes for a very sloppy writing and is extremely easy to write. Hence, I find the movie bad.

He is desperately needed now when the situation with the comedies in Hollywood could be described as tragically horrible or horrifyingly tragic. Now when I think of it, even his less successful Spies Like Us (1985) and Three Amigos! (1986) were very funny and enjoyable. Landis has also directed nine episodes of the cult TV show, the first Sex and City, Dream On, and believe me, Dream On was fabulous. Of all mentioned films, Trading Places is one of the best, at least for me. I can't count how many times I've seen this funny and clever comedy. Trading Places tells the story of two men who were far from each other in any possible way as yes and no - one Harvard graduate, a successful snobbish commodity broker, the financial wizard with bright future in front of him, and great present that included a stunning fiancée, membership in a prestigious exclusive club, and even a butler, a true English gentleman. The other - a black street hustler, a small time drug dealer from the wrong site of the town. What could possibly bring them together and even make them partners out for revenge? You may say the fate or you may say, boredom and intrigues of two very rich, very arrogant, very shameless men - Brothers Randolph and Mortimer Duke (Ralph Bellamy, Don Ameche), the founders and owners of Philadelphia commodity stock Exchange who liked to make bets to prove their points about nature versus nurture theory and enjoyed watching how other people's reputations, happiness and even lives crumbles in front of them. The brothers were curious to find out what is primary, the environment or heredity in forming a human? What would happen if take a successful, well off man, ruin his reputation and throw him on the street and substitute him with a streetwise petty criminal? How would they adjust and what would they do to survive such unexpected turn of fortune? Well, it sounds rather dramatic but the movie is a masterpiece of comedy. It is not just good; it is timeless comedy that does not show a trace of growing outdated. It is based not only on the comic situations but on the changing characters, their communication, getting together and creating the team that would make revenge sweet, smart, and totally satisfying. The acting of two major players, Dan Aycroyd and Eddie Murphy is marvelous. Santa episode is among the funniest yet poignant I've seen. Just to think of Aycroyd, hiding behind a dirty Santa beard and growling like an angry animal over the smoked salmon that he stole from the Christmas party at his former company and hid on his chest made me laugh hysterically.

And there is incredible Denholm Elliott, the loyal butler Coleman to both Louis Winthorpe III (Dan Aykroyd) and Billy Ray Valentine (Eddie Murphy). To top it all, there is the greatest (I am sure of it) scene of betting on future trading on the commodities trading floor that involves short-selling orange juice futures and turning an enormous profit for some characters and equally enormous loss for the others.

(I am assuming that the tape and DVD Version are the same as the Laser disc version and general release version) I think it would be great if there could be a Directors Cut version released that included all of the parts of the film that was cut from the general release version. The cinematography was just great and the acting was superior! It should have won an Oscar or two!

No way a movie like this could be made- and work out as well now days. This movie is even more film noir-like than most genre movies I have seen.What makes this movie even more film-noir like than others is its story. It has an incredible amount of twists and turns in it. Characters reappear at unexpected moments, you don't know who to thrust and the story will leave you guessing to the end. The movie starts simple with a man who hires a private detective to find his wife but the plot starts to thicken more and more rapidly after that. Yes, it's a complicated story but its also such a fine written one that you can't help to be sucked in by it.It's quite atmospheric, though perhaps not as atmospheric as other genre movies. It's really more it's story than anything else that makes this movie such a classic film-noir.It also doesn't feature the best genre actors but the acting is still fine, mostly due to its simply wonderful dialog and script. Its tough dialog is typical for its genre and provides the movie with a really typical sense of style and atmosphere.A great movie within its genre.9\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"21 March 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a real old fashioned film noir alright.
