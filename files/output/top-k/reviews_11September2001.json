While in some cases, they are clones (some are very generic) some are very good (most usually direct-to-video titles) but with Final Destination, I was completely blown away.  This one went down as a classic, in my book, and Ive seen it close to ten times in the last year.  It's a very fresh and inventive take on horror and a welcome change from the whole slasher with a motive formula, which is tried and true, but also tired and true.  Although, I love slasher flicks with a passion, and I can never get sick of 'em, this doesn't really count.  Let me explain (just a bit) on what seperates this film from the rest of the pack and why someone who usually doesn't enjoy slasher flicks might find something to like here.First off, I'm really glad to see a horror flick that takes itself seriously and doesn't committ horror film-suicide by cracking in-jokes and making fun of itself.  In some cases that works really well, but it's growing very tiresome lately (Urban Legends 2, anyone?) and I'm glad they left it alone here.  The film focuses on our deepest, darkest fear (death) and it certainly doesn't make light of it.*Spoilers* (minor) A group of high school kids are about to take a trip to France.  Once boarding the plain, Alex (Devon Sawa) has a dream of the plain crashing on take-off.  He totally goes ballistic, getting himself, five other students, and a teacher booted off the plain.  The plain takes off and sure enough, it explodes.  So what we have here is seven people who just cheated death and (you guessed it) death is none too happy about it, (even Death doesn't like being duped)so he goes about taking the last seven down (in slasher fashion) one by one and it's up to (guess who?) Alex to try and save the day.  (Or something like that.)It's made clear from the get-go that death doesn't like to screw around. He means business.  Another cool thing is that you can't see death (it's not just some guy in a cloak).  You can feel the preasence.  It's also nice that this isn't the whodunnit? formula.  We know damn well who it is and he is virtually unstoppable.  So we have seven people here, death lurking around the corner and Alex at the center of it all doing his best to stop it. What follows is some of the most inventive and ellaborate, most well thought out death sequences I have ever seen, period.  I won't go into any detail here but I can tell you this much; I was scared s#!tless.The cast is pretty good here.  Devon Sawa (Idle Hands) is awesome here. He does his job extremely well, giving a very layered, textured, heart felt performance.  He's gonna make it huge pretty soon and he deserves it. Kerr Smith (Carter) does a better job here than he did in the more recent (The Forsaken).  His character is totally unlikeable and I was really looking forward to his demise.  He's the rich jock-boy with an attitude that we all went to high school.  He's always angry and impossible to reason with. Kristen Cloke was really good as Miss Newton.  She plays a teacher who seems to have lived a very sad life.  She plays the part beutifully and looks beautiful.This movie is very well done and those concerned that the horror genre may be dying, need not fear.

Also, if your command of cockney English is not quite up to par, I suggest you watch Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels a few more times to brush up because, as many previous viewers have mentioned, the dialogue is fast, furious, and VERY cockney and if you blink, you may miss something.

Most of it takes place in Gal's villa in southern Spain -intensifying the feeling of invasion perpetrated by this unwelcome guest.

The apes themselves can be sort of unintentionally funny at times, but the make-up for them was amazing! Wow, I just gave up trying to guess who the actors were after a while because the ape make-up was so astounding and convincing, you couldn't even tell who's eyes were under that hunk of hair! The actors do well, Mark Wahlberg fits the leading role well and gives it his all. I don't think his character was very considerate and I think he tried to be a little too much like Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic, but apart from that, he's done well. Helena Bonham Carter was really fantastic and has the pleasure of playing the most developed character in Planet of the Apes, giving her character and performance depth, more-so than Wahlberg's sometimes selfish hero. Tim Roth was evil and believable and the most ape-like actor in the film. Tim Burton's direction shines through the movie, especially the final reel.

I can only think of three excellent movies that have been released this summer.  First is Steven Spielberg's dark underrated classic A.I. a movie that has much more depth than people believe.  Second is Tim Burton's PLANET OF THE APES which did a good job retelling the 1968 classic with Burton giving his usual style to the tale. Now Kevin Smith does his part by adding JAY & SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK to the small list of excellent films that were released this summer. I've seen JAY & SILENT BOB three times already being that I am a Kevin Smith fan and that it's so darn funny!  But, be aware, in order to get a real kick out of this film you MUST see Smith's other works first (CLERKS, MALLRATS, CHASING AMY, & DOGMA), since this film has connections to Smith's previous films.  Quick Stop regulars Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) are given a restraining order from the Quick Stop after Randall and Dante (Jason Anderson and Brian o' Hollaran from CLERKS) are tired of Jay and Bob selling dope in front of the stores.  So when Jay and Bob now hang out at their friend's Brodie (Jason Lee from MALLRATS) Brodie tells Jay and Bob that they should have a lot of money since a movie about comic characters Bluntman and Chronic (which were based on Jay and Bob) is being made, and they should get likeness royalties.  Jay and Bob are upset since they haven't gotten a red cent, so they visit Bluntman and Chronic creator Holden (Ben Affleck from CHASING AMY) and want their money.  Holden tells them that he sold the comic rights to his partner Banky (also Jason Lee from CHASING AMY) and has no control over the comic.  But what gets Jay and Bob upset (especially Jay) is that computer internet geeks have been saying bad things about the two of them.  So Jay and Silent Bob head off to Hollywood to stop the film from being made so these internet *%&$ can stop saying anything else bad about them.  While on their way, Jay and Bob meet a quartet or international jewel thieves Sissy (Eliza Dushku), Chrissy (Ali Larter), Missy (Jennifer Schwalbach Smith) and Justice (Shannon Elizabeth). Of the four, only Justice is the friendly one to Jay and Bob, causing Jay to fall in love with her.  Jay would do anything for Justice, including stealing a monkey with Deputy Wildlife Marshall Willenholly (Will Ferrall) after them.  From there on is one funny scene after another until the credtis are over. I would place this movie along with such comic classics as STRIPES, GHOSTBUSTERS, TRADING PLACES, ANIMAL HOUSE, and VACATION.  It's a movie that you can watch over and over and laugh just as much the eighth time watching it as you did the first.  The jokes are witty, clever, and very very funny! And the film does a excellent job building up the laughter that the last thirty minutes are hysterical as Jay and Bob wander the studio backlot of Miramax Studios. People for the next few months will argue and debate on which Kevin Smith film is the best CHASING AMY or JAY & SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK.  I would lean more towards this film since it's faster, funnier, and more exciting.  I still enjoy CHASING AMY, but as a romantic-comedy, JAY & SILENT BOB is a excellent comedy, flat-out comedy, nothing more, nothing less. Smith does a brilliant job adding in jokes from his previous films (such as having character cameos from Smith's previous films) as well as other popular films (GOOD WILL HUNTING 2 HUNTING SEASON is one of the film's highlights).  And for this, this will have the audience entertained throughout the film.  And the acting is also good,  Jason Mewes does a very good job as dim-witted, foul mouth Jay.  Mewes is energetic and always very obscene yet funny, unlike other comedians Mewes uses his profanity with humor.  And Smith also does a great job with his facial reactions and gestures using the comic talent that Buster Keaton and Charles Chaplin used in the silent-era. One more thing, the international jewel thieves are very very sexy! When watching the film, all three times, the male hormones rose as the theater got very very steamy.  Seeing four sexy females in skin-tight leather outfits make the women from last years CHARLIE'S ANGELS look dull and plain.  Plus their screen time which is about 40% of the film is better than all of CHARLIE'S ANGELS. This is a comedy that is funny, but not for everyone.  Those who enjoyed AMERICAN PIE, THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, even ANIMAL HOUSE, STRIPES, MALLRATS and THE SIMPSONS will find this movie to be very funny and one of the best films this year.  But for those phonies out there who prefer to watch comedy from NBC must see Thursdays, MISS CONGENALITY, RUNAWAY BRIDE, AMERICAN SWEETHEARTS, CHOCOLATE, and other touchy and sappy feel good movies will hate this movie with a passion.  I get around five to ten people a day complain how many times does the F-word have to be said in this film? Well the people need to relize that is Smith's style.  Every director has a unique style and direction (that is why they direct big budget films). And Kevin Smith style is the reality talk with profanity mixed into it. I just hope Jay and Silent Bob are reading this, because if they are this is what I would like to say to them THANK YOU DUDES VERY MUCH!

Okay, so it drifts off to the corny land sometimes, and the running time is a bit long, but no worries, this remains really entertaining thanks to excellent casting, a touching script and well-directed American football sequences. Denzel Washington gives a masterful performance as the honest, brutal and determined Coach Boone. It is one of his best after The Hurricane, I couldn't take my eyes off Denzel. His character was a revelation, someone I'd really like to play in a movie. The supporting characters do just fine and give Denzel his back-up. The film's goal is to make people care for its story and characters and we do, strongly. The movie reaches into our hearts with its soul and harmonic expression. I think the fact that Remember the Titans is a true story helped it become more enjoyable and more real. If this wasn't a true story you'd probably be saying `yeah, right' to some of the events. The thought of knowing this really happened and that the characters are real made the experience much more touching and entertaining. This is not the most important element in a film, but I loved the music too. The soundtrack is worth the money and has plenty of classic playable tunes.

Even moreso than John Carpenter's Halloween. Friday the 13th was the other film that helped make the slasher genre popular and it's bloody style was more shamelessly copied than the bloodless Halloween. It would turn out to be a bad thing because too many movies started to rely on pointless gore and the MMPA started cracking down, but that's besides the point. Unlike the stylish Halloween, Friday the 13th has more of a straight forward look to it. There's no clever shots of the killer moving around in the background. Instead we get normal living their normal lives until one of them just happens to have their forehead split open by an ax. Director Sean Cunningham also pulls off kick ass little tricks with the camera and uses a thunderstorm to great effect. The dark and stormy night idea is used to perfection here.  Also on the plus side to this movie are Tom Savani's simple but brilliant special effects and good\/adequate acting by the whole cast. Sure there wasn't a Donald Pleasence-esque performance like in Halloween, but there didn't need to be. Crazy Ralph was a kool dude though... I also loved how pretty much all the teens got the same amount of screentime (until one of them was killed off, of course). While watching the movie, I honestly had no idea who would make it out alive. Just when I thought one person would end up the survivor, they got pulled out of the running when they were found impaled on the shed door. Honestly I can't praise this movie enough. A gradual pace, laced with kool murders, decent characters, and a killer finale. You aren't a horror fan if you haven't seen this one.  Oh and by the way....it's not a Halloween rip off.

Instead we get normal living their normal lives until one of them just happens to have their forehead split open by an ax. Director Sean Cunningham also pulls off kick ass little tricks with the camera and uses a thunderstorm to great effect. The dark and stormy night idea is used to perfection here.  Also on the plus side to this movie are Tom Savani's simple but brilliant special effects and good\/adequate acting by the whole cast. Sure there wasn't a Donald Pleasence-esque performance like in Halloween, but there didn't need to be. Crazy Ralph was a kool dude though... I also loved how pretty much all the teens got the same amount of screentime (until one of them was killed off, of course). While watching the movie, I honestly had no idea who would make it out alive. Just when I thought one person would end up the survivor, they got pulled out of the running when they were found impaled on the shed door. Honestly I can't praise this movie enough. A gradual pace, laced with kool murders, decent characters, and a killer finale. You aren't a horror fan if you haven't seen this one.  Oh and by the way....it's not a Halloween rip off. Get over it.**** out of **** ","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"11 September 2001","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"   I love this movie. I really do. Even moreso than John Carpenter's Halloween. Friday the 13th was the other film that helped make the slasher genre popular and it's bloody style was more shamelessly copied than the bloodless Halloween.

I liked the way this movie ventured into things we haven't seen done quite so professionally lately, it was certainly a great movie that has the guts to be different and even funny in its seriously no-jokes premise.

You can see Coppola's effort shining in the behind-camera areas, and the performances in front of the cameras are amazing. Kathleen Turner is real and strictly engaging, while Kirsten Dunst is entirely bewitching as the most interesting and risky sister. This film leaves on a totally haunting note and you may have to just sit still and watch the credits for a few minutes before walking again. There are also some really neat camera-tricks and some shots that will definitely be remembered for their visual excellence. Sofia Coppola may need to work on her story-telling skills (which are indeed good, but in the middle The Virgin Suicides may tend to drag on for some audiences) but I was very satisfied with this fascinating and memorable picture that will certainly stick in your sleep.
