Yet again, the greatest degenerating factor here is the character development. Or, of course, the lack there of. Actually, the characters here were a little more interesting than the ones in the past two Elm Street movies. Well, one was. I really liked the character of Rick. I truly did. I thought he had a little bit of depth to him and I could really make a connection to this guy. Was he a fantastic character? Not really... but he was still a lot more interesting than a lot of characters I have seen in these movies. Of course, a part of that might even be credit to the actor. He was the one decent actor on screen, besides Englund.For, you see, the acting in Dream Master was deplorable. It wasn't just bad; it was embarrassingly bad. Lisa Wilcox played Alice Johnson, the Final Girl of the last film as well. Except now she is played by an actress who cannot act save her life. It's a shame. She has a very pretty face, but not an acting ability to match. She was over-dramatic part of the time and under dramatic the rest of the time. I could not get a rhythm or sense of truth in her acting at all. It was extremely difficult, for that reason, for me to care for that character. But Wilcox wasn't the only one. Danny Hassle, who played Wilcox's love interest, was equally bad, and I don't think Brooke Theiss (Debbie) was trying at all. I mean, these were really some bad, bad, bad, bad acting. And the dialogue itself was not a whole lot better. Once again, as in the last film, the film decides, inexplicably, to barrage its audience with puns thrown out by Freddy. I always gave Freddy more respect than that, but evidently I gave him too much respect. His character has reached the same level as Mr. Freeze from Batman And Robin.***Warning Here There Be Spoilers*** And, once again, I am left with a stupid Elm Street movie ending. In the end of the movie, Kristen hears some children sing a song of how to kill Freddy by showing him his own reflection. Who were those children? How come they knew how to kill Krueger but had never done so themselves? Where did they get this information? How come Krueger completely ignores their presence? And if the argument is that they are victims of Freddy, riddle me this how can they be his victims if all of his victims are located inside his skin? Speaking of which, why was Freddy's reflection what set off the victim's rage that ripped him apart? What kind of magic or voodoo did that set off? And is it just me, or does Freddy keep falling to some pretty lame deaths? Like being killed by the power of love in Elm Street 2 or just having his bones get buried in Elm Street 3. ***But, all of that aside, there were a few really nice things about this film. What struck me the most were three aspects of the movie. First of all, the direction was pretty good. It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad at all. Renny Harlin took over from Chuck Russell (the last film's director), and I was very pleased with his style. I would even say that in many instances, I was a little impressed. He moves his camera very well, knows how to set up the scenes, and does a decent job with the dream sequences.The dream sequences were, by the way, the second really good aspect of this movie. These dream sequences were whole-heartedly creative and I have to admit I was pretty struck by the visuals at times. In fact, I enjoyed the dream sequences so much, I'd say they rival the ones that appeared in the first movie. The only downside is that while in the first movie Craven put in a lot of effort to blend the dreams with reality, this film makes it pretty obvious what is a dream and what is reality. Still, they aren't bad at all.And the third great part of this movie was, of course, Robert Englund. I don't think I talk about him enough for these films, but Englund does have a great on screen presence, even if his character isn't always written the best. I could tell Englund was having a lot of fun with his role, even more so than in the last two films. So, that effort was appreciated.Still... Those contributing factors was not quite enough for me to call this film a worthwhile experience. The acting was too god-awful, the dialogue was too stupid, and the audience still didn't get enough time to become acquainted with these characters. But, this was not an awful movie, and I would say that if the next film was any better at all, I'd give it a thumbs up in a heartbeat.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 September 2010","score":"","review":" A Nightmare On Elm Street 4 The Dream Master I liked just about as much as its predecessor.

Period.Perhaps it's because this is the way Wes Craven truly wanted a Freddy Krueger movie to be treated. Perhaps it's because of the heightened characterizations the audience is treated to. Perhaps it's even because of the way the direction was handled in comparison to the other films. In any event, I even enjoyed New Nightmare over the first Nightmare On Elm Street movie.I'll start with the man himself, Freddy Krueger. As Robert Englund (the character) even says in the film, this is a darker, eviler Freddy than audiences have seen. His look is profoundly different and, in my opinion, he looks better than ever. This was the first time since the first movie I was able to take Krueger seriously. Oh, I enjoyed Englund's performance through nearly all the Elm Street movies, but here he adds a little bit of something that I haven't seen before.First of all, I want to point out to every horror writer and director out there that *this* is the way puns are to be used, if you choose to use them as a precursor to something dark and sinister. Remember in the third film when Krueger asks Feeling tongue-tied? and wraps a boy in his (Freddy's) tongue? Not like that. Or in the last film when he says Nice hearing from you, Carlos after blowing up a kids head with sound waves? Not like that either. No, when Freddy asks the boy Do you want to see how to skin a cat? while gripping his babysitter's skin in his claw, that's how to do a pun. Perhaps it doesn't even count as a pun, I don't know (I wasn't sure if I got it anyway), but when Krueger said that, I got a very faint chill down my spine. That was pretty chilling.The way they treated Freddy here goes back to the good ol' days when Freddy had a bit of dignity and credibility in him. Throughout the film, Craven makes the incredibly wise decision of never showing Freddy's full body or even letting the audience in on what he's up to. Instead, we get a lot of shots of his claw piercing through materials and heading sinisterly toward a victim.This is indeed the most effective Freddy movie, hands down. And it's also the Freddy movie with the lowest body-count, I would like to point out. And I believe that's because every single death is given a very deep meaning and depth to it. At no point does a character die and not mentioned again. No, in New Nightmare, when a character dies, the audience has that death on their mind for the rest of the picture.And the music! The musical score in New Nightmare is better than even the first movie, and that is definitely saying something. I loved the soundtrack to this movie. Wes Craven, for the most part, did away with the rock songs that had been a large part of the soundtracks since the second or third movie.I also want to praise all of the performers in this film, especially Englund, as both himself and Krueger. And Heather Langenkamp as well. Always one of the best Final Girl performances of all time, she gives 100% in this new film, making her performance, above all else, believable. There is also a child actor who plays Langenkamp's son and he is one of the better child actors I have seen in a *long* time.There is also a very interesting side character in this film. I have already praised this film for its characterizations and I don't think anything shows that better than the nurse in this film. Her character is very interesting. Even though she acts like an antagonist or obstacle for Langenkamp for a majority of the picture, this is not a bad person. She is looking out for the best for both Langenkamp and her son. It is very difficult for the audience to side against this character when her desires are so sincere to see the characters come out of their ordeal alright, and I think that's what makes her a great character. This film is full of stuff like that.Wes Craven delivers the ultimate Nightmare movie in a way that only he could with Wes Craven's New Nightmare. It blends dreams with reality in a way audiences haven't seen since the first film and he treats all the characters in the story with the love and care that they have been lacking since nearly the start of the series.

Nope. Sorry. Not even close. My world doesn't revolve around Dark Knight and Avatar.To give you an idea of where my tastes lie at the moment, my wife and I have spent the summer THRILLED that we finally have a DVR attached to TCM.So maybe you think we're not big on Westerns. Nope. Having moved out West from America's East years ago, we've finally embraced the genre. In fact, we're seeing and enjoying a lot of Westerns from this period. Finally saw HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER and BIG COUNTRY and adored both.I'm a child of 70's cinema, and so your next natural presumption is that I adored BLAZING SADDLES and can't give BALLOU a fair shake. Wrong yet again. I think Blazing is a desperate and stupid TV movie, where Young Frank is genius.Am I conservative with something against Jane Fonda? Nope. I'm a screaming liberal who must confess a downright carnal worship and Fondaness for this lifelong beauty.And so why HISS at CAT BALLOU? The movie opens with Stubby and Nat playing banjos. Something about Nat in a bright western get up playing a banjo feels like Elvis Presley dressed up like Liberace and affecting effeminate chords under a chandelier. It's not funny HA-HA but funny BAD.And it doesn't help that we meet him while walking under a stage for an intended hanging. Umm, call me racially sensitive, but 1965 wasn't a cultural kosher time to send a black man strolling underneath a gallows just as a trapdoor drops and a noose nearly bounces off his head.Reviewers on IMDb state with great joy how HILARIOUS Stubby and Nat are in these sequences. Forgive me, but these songs are repetitive, overlong, and typically as funny as a jammed office printer. The frequency with which these crooners come and go -- doing nearly the same thing -- indicates a screenplay utterly bereft of pages and story.The thing is Stubby isn't needed. Nat King Cole could sing circles around Sinatra, and if you have Nat -- that's all you need. If included at all, Nat should have been a singing gunslinger type who tipped up his hat once in a while -- revealing his presence -- to croon a quick tune -- and then back under the hat. Anymore time than this and it RIPS the viewer clear out of the story, which it did EVERY time. In SOMETHING ABOUT MARY this peculiar device worked, but here it was painful -- except for the sunset ballad Nat did around midpoint.Jane Fonda. Beauty and chops. All they needed to start the story on her and stay there. Transition from gal to gunslinger. Great idea, and so what went wrong? The film starts at the end. Giving away her what would have been her otherwise fun and fascinating transition. Hell, the animation of the Columbia Pictures chick gives it away even. For the life of me, I don't see how showing and singing about what a bad@$$ she becomes will helps the story. Now we're just sitting around waiting for it to happen instead of going delighting in her transformation. Sigh.What's worse is the transition SUCKS. Her Dad gets killed in a way befitting a drama, not a comedy. So she rides off all mad and learns that local Sheriff is going to do nothing about it. Okay, and so seemingly ten minutes later, Little Miss Emily Post decides to rob a train. Huh? Why? Does it matter? This chick robbing a train is as believable as Hannibal Lector being hired as a wedding consultant.So when she picks up the newspaper and announces her train robbery dreams, the house of cards is almost ready to collapse. But something must have been working better up to this point, right? Yes. Lee Marvin. His drunken gunslinger is funny. Please note not HILARIOUS, but funny in a promising way. In this nearly pathetic movie, of course he steals the show. Something or somebody needed to, and Marvin had the luck of the draw. But like the rest of the film, his bits were milked silly, overlong, repetitive, and... confusing.His bit was that he was a hungover alcoholic DISASTER of a gunslinger until he had enough to drink to see and shoot clearly. Okay, I love that. But then these fools RUINED it by making his window of clarity only good for a minute or two before his continued boozing ruined him again. That's not as funny an idea as -- -- having the booze make clean him up so good that he became the love interest to Fonda. That is, lose characters 'sex addict' and 'Uncle' and just have Marvin do his alcoholic Jeckyl and Hyde bit. If Fonda was becoming a boozer to get him to help her, her metamorphosis from Cute to Clint would have worked perfectly.But no, we had to watch Marvin stumble and stare off into nothing a few too many times.

The first is the relationship between Han Solo and Leia Organa, which is touched upon in a New Hope, but is fleshed out more in this film. The other is the more central relationship between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. This relationship is also linked in to the main supporting character in this film, Yoda, who is fantastically well realised by the film crew and performed brilliantly by Frank Oz. There are other characters, but whereas C3P0 and R2D2 were a central part of the story in the previous film, they are more on the sidelines.What makes this film so great though is the involving and effective way the relationships operate within the broader story. The banter between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher is highly effective and amusing, operating through the classical love-hate relationship. One senses that Kershner, as a director of character driven films, worked very effectively with the actors and gave them the space to develop their characters which meant plenty of choices for the director in terms of their performances. The same goes for Mark Hamill's interaction with Yoda(Frank Oz). This is totally convincing and builds up the confrontation with Darth Vader very well. It was time well spent in getting these performances right. Kershner is very good at keeping the performance naturalistic, but reduces the level of broadness in the characters, making them more complex and interesting. Darth Vader benefits from this with scenes in the film that add to the mystique of the character. The confrontation with Luke Skywalker is riveting and dramatic and elevates the film above the level of its predecessor. Technically the film is even more impressive than its predecessor. Credit has to go the Oscar nominated Art Direction team. John Barry, who had worked on the previous film, passed away during the production, but Norman Reynolds led the team superbly, with the excellent creations of Dagobah and Hoth, albeit Bespin in the original does feel a bit like a set, and the digital embellishments in the special edition were helpful in creating a bigger feel to those scenes. However, I was disappointed in the reworked scene with Palpatine in the special edition - while putting the excellent Ian McDiarmid was supporting continuity, to show him face on was, in my view an error and the reworked scene would have played much better with his face shrouded, or at the least partially obscured. The whole point of the scene was that the dialogue as strong enough without the need to ram an unsubtle visual at the audience. Editing is excellent, led by Star Wars veteran Paul Hirsch, but it is known that both George Lucas, and his then wife Marcia were also heavily involved in putting the film together. Peter Suschitzky's photography is more conventional and low key in approach than A New Hope, but is particularly effective on the Dagobah scenes in Elstree Studios, and the location scenes in Norway. ILM's visual effects were outstanding, and rightly won an Academy Award. The crew consisted of the following Oscar winning A New Hope veteran Richard Edlund, working with British effects supervisor Brian Johnson (who had just won an Oscar for Alien), effects photographer Dennis Muren (who would become an award winning and digital effects pioneer for ILM for ET, Return of the Jedi, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Innerspace, The Abyss, T2 and Jurassic Park) and compositor Bruce Nicholson, who would go on to win an Oscar for his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark, and work on a wide variety of films in Hollywood. George Lucas took a strong interest and influence in the special effects and also has to take credit for some of the excellent sequences in the film, which also work because they help drive the story along. Again, like a New Hope, sound work was first rate and Oscar winning. In most cases the sound has to be recorded in a studio and added many months after filming has been completed. Sound re-recordist Bill Varney would win another Oscar for Raiders of the Lost Ark. Steve Maslow and Gregg Landaker also worked as sound-recordists and are both prolific contributors to many high profile movies. They would also win Oscars for their work on Raiders and then some fourteen years later win again for their work on the Keanu Reeves hit movie Speed. Peter Sutton won for his on&#x96;set work and has a large body of work in film since this movie. Also credit has to go the Ben Burtt's sound design work, which creates a fabulous sound-scape for the film.However, despite the above outstanding technical contributions, which serve to enhance and exciting and interesting story, it is composer John Williams who, yet again, takes this film to another level with another astounding musical score. Working with the director and producers, Williams develops and expands original themes. He creates a new and unforgettable theme for Darth Vader, with strong militaristic overtones, and clever themes for Leia and Han, and for Yoda. He weaves the score into the film expertly, giving moments of tension, excitement, thoughtfulness, mystery and tragedy with aplomb. The score feels more operatic than a New Hope, and helps cement this as one of the best adventure\/fantasy films ever made. Congratulations to Mr Lucas for delivering a remarkable sequel, but also to Gary Kurtz and Irvin Kershner for having the courage to push everyone out of their comfort zones so as to reach this level of excellence.

The first half is a film about boot camp the second follows a correspondent into urban combat in Vietnam. The first half is incredible; the boot camp is tense and realistic. But it's a good thing that it doesn't last the whole film. I don't think that it could have been as extreme, they would have had to stretch it out and it would have lost its fast paced action. R Lee Ermey pretty much steals the show in the first half. His performance is impressive and one of the most memorable performances in any war film. Many other characters had good performances as well, mostly Vincent D'Onofrio. His performance starts out seemingly poor. The further his character (Gomer Pyle) gets pushed and the more he starts to look crazy the better performance he gives. Seems like hes better at playing a crazy person than a mentally slow person. ****first part spoiler****We finish part one with one of the most tense scenes in all of film, with all three main characters giving their best performances. Knowing Kubrick's perfectionism this scene must have been just as tense to shoot as the final outcome. Pyle snaps, kills Hartman, kills himself and no matter how many times I see it, my jaw still drops. The look on D'Onofrio's face is incredible, such pain and insanity. It helps make the scene as memorable as it is, one of the greatest facial performances (is that a term?) ever.****end spoilers****Just as it seems like the film is over the second half jumps in. moving from tension at his highest straight into Vietnam and a hooker walking to the beat of These Boots are Made for Walking A very strange transition that actually works out great. The second half is still a great movie but not as much as the first half. It's a lot like your average war movie in a lot of ways but still very distinct. We see much different kinds of characters than the average Vietnam movie. Usually it's a bunch of hard asses and one guy who doesn't like what they are doing, while we do see both of those types, we see many others as well. Due to the styles of fighting it's actually more like a World War 2 film rather than Vietnam because its urban warfare rather than in the jungle. I don't have as much to say about the second half. It's fantastic but nothing that stands out from other great war movies. Great soundtrack, directing, writing, acting, fighting, all of that, just not as memorable as the first half.****spoilers****My favorite thing about the second half is that, though they complete little missions, nothing really gets accomplished. It could have ended with the killing of the sniper but that would have made it seem like that was the mission and that finished it. By adding the last scene of the soldiers walking singing the Mickey Mouse song it showed that the war wasn't over and nothing really has changed for them, or the war. I'm guessing this is probably how a lot of people felt during the war, and even after it. Kubrick didn't mean for this to be an anti war film, but by showing the war the way it was, it can't really be seen as anything but that, in my opinion. ****end spoilers****Any fan of Kubrick's work should definitely watch this film. Anyone that's a fan of war films or really fans of movies in general should not miss this one either. One of cinema's best. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 September 2010","score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Full Metal Jacket (1987)Full Metal Jacket seems like 2 great short films rolled into one.

Usually it's a bunch of hard asses and one guy who doesn't like what they are doing, while we do see both of those types, we see many others as well. Due to the styles of fighting it's actually more like a World War 2 film rather than Vietnam because its urban warfare rather than in the jungle. I don't have as much to say about the second half. It's fantastic but nothing that stands out from other great war movies. Great soundtrack, directing, writing, acting, fighting, all of that, just not as memorable as the first half.****spoilers****My favorite thing about the second half is that, though they complete little missions, nothing really gets accomplished. It could have ended with the killing of the sniper but that would have made it seem like that was the mission and that finished it. By adding the last scene of the soldiers walking singing the Mickey Mouse song it showed that the war wasn't over and nothing really has changed for them, or the war. I'm guessing this is probably how a lot of people felt during the war, and even after it. Kubrick didn't mean for this to be an anti war film, but by showing the war the way it was, it can't really be seen as anything but that, in my opinion. ****end spoilers****Any fan of Kubrick's work should definitely watch this film. Anyone that's a fan of war films or really fans of movies in general should not miss this one either. One of cinema's best. 10\/10 ","genre":"Drama, War"},{"date":"12 September 2010","score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Full Metal Jacket (1987)Full Metal Jacket seems like 2 great short films rolled into one. The first half is a film about boot camp the second follows a correspondent into urban combat in Vietnam. The first half is incredible; the boot camp is tense and realistic. But it's a good thing that it doesn't last the whole film. I don't think that it could have been as extreme, they would have had to stretch it out and it would have lost its fast paced action. R Lee Ermey pretty much steals the show in the first half. His performance is impressive and one of the most memorable performances in any war film. Many other characters had good performances as well, mostly Vincent D'Onofrio. His performance starts out seemingly poor. The further his character (Gomer Pyle) gets pushed and the more he starts to look crazy the better performance he gives. Seems like hes better at playing a crazy person than a mentally slow person. ****first part spoiler****We finish part one with one of the most tense scenes in all of film, with all three main characters giving their best performances. Knowing Kubrick's perfectionism this scene must have been just as tense to shoot as the final outcome. Pyle snaps, kills Hartman, kills himself and no matter how many times I see it, my jaw still drops. The look on D'Onofrio's face is incredible, such pain and insanity. It helps make the scene as memorable as it is, one of the greatest facial performances (is that a term?) ever.****end spoilers****Just as it seems like the film is over the second half jumps in. moving from tension at his highest straight into Vietnam and a hooker walking to the beat of These Boots are Made for Walking A very strange transition that actually works out great.

The whole idea behind the first movie was that it was about a killer who murdered people through their dreams. Here, he comes to life through a boy and kills people?

This movie presented base with a nature, simple and touching way, it was popular after the movie showed up. I think people who are not live in Chinese rural cannot deeply understand the education in there. This movie shows the real situation in one of the north rural in China, it is the education issues of reality, but this situation leads many serious problems. I actually do not like the tradition style of Chinese movie; however this movie was touch my heart deeply. This movie is the most successful film for Zhang Yimou and it has one characteristic compare with Zhang Yimou's previous or later movies, he used all non-professional actress, and all actors used their own name and played their real story. The film tells the story of the rural elementary school, Mr. Gao is the only one teacher, but his mother was sick and he has to take a month holiday. Therefore, the school found a 13 years old girl (Miss Wei) to be a substitute teacher for Mr. Gao. Miss Wei's education is very low. Mr. Gao told Miss Wei that not one less, and this sentence became a responsibility to Miss Wei. This movie shows a group of pure rural children, they never been anywhere else, they only in that rural. One thing very interesting is Mr. Gao also has no high level education background, he does not know how to teach. He just writes on the blackboard everything in the book, and asks all the students to copy it down, and then it is a class. Do you think student can learn something? This is a big problem in some rural in china. Some teachers not even know how to teach student, then how student are able to learn things. Or maybe students learn some incorrect information. This also make me think that China is too big, and the gap between wealth and poor are too big, that caused many problems. In my opinion, there are two main parts in this movie. The first part is Miss Wei needs money, and if she takes over Mr. Gao's job for a month then she could get 50 RMB. Miss Wei is playing an important role here, if she wants to get the 50 dollars, she can't let any student out, she has keep every student in a save place in a month. Not one less is the only responsibility for her, therefore; she does not care how naughty students are, she just care not let anyone out. One day, there is some sport teachers wanted to take one of the students to a modern city and train him. But Miss Wei hided the student and did not let the sport teacher to take him out. This represent that Miss Wei does not know to let this boy out of the village is a good chance for him, but she has a responsibility to not let one less. This shows the wrong education way in rural China. The other part is Miss Wei searched for the second student is not only of the 50 dollars responsibility, it is because of the teacher reasonability, it is about love. The student Zhang huike went to a city, and Miss Wei asked all the students to search for Zhang huike in that city. This part was very touching, Miss Wei does not care how hard to find the student, she had to do what she promised Mr. Gao. Not one less. I can see that money is very important in the tradition Chinese society. Because of 50 dollars, Miss Wei has to search the student in a big city that she never been to there, and it was danger and hard. One the other hand, there are one shot that makes me feel uncomfortable, the shot talk about Miss Wei wanted to get into the T.V station to see the manager, but the reception lady used unfriendly and look down people's attitude to told Miss Wei that she can't go in. this represent that many big cities in China always look down some rural city.

The film takes place in modern day Rome , and modern day is in the 40s because that was when the film was made.The film starts off with a man yelling the name Ricci (Maggiorani) who is a person that gives out jobs. Ricci goes to the man and finds out that he is getting a job that pays very well but he needs a bicycle. His bicycle is getting repaired and it is not supposed to be done for a week and he needs it for the next morning. Ricci goes to the repair shot and pays extra to get his bicycle. His wife and son are very happy for him and he is extremely excited to go to his first day of work because he was so unlucky in the past. Unfortunately at his first day of work while gluing posters to the wall someone steals his bicycle. And that is when the chase to get his bicycle back begins...The screenplay for this film received an Oscar nomination which it well deserved, and it probably deserved to win as well even though I have not yet seen the film that did win. The writing was so simple, so pure and that is what I loved about it. It was easy to watch yet extremely thought provoking. The film is truly amazing because the plot is so basic but it is just so powerful. I don't wish to spoil anything but the ending is absolutely brilliant as well. The screenplay for this film is a masterpiece and I wish more of them today were like this.The direction for this film also was quite simple, which made it quite brilliant. There are only few films that get me so emotionally attached to their main characters. De Sica does not use complex shots really at all in this film yet I still think it is one of the best directed films ever made. It is hard to describe, the only word I can really think of is pure. De Sica did not direct this film to make money or to win awards, he just directed it because it was what he was born to do.The acting for this film was as well superb. Maggiorani plays Ricci and he is fantastic. He is just a simple man who wants his bicycle back so he can get money to support his family. He is the everyman and Maggiorani played the role perfectly. Enzo Staiola was Ricci's son and he was just the normal kid and he also did his role perfectly. It was like the two of them weren't acting at all they were just that real father and son. The supporting cast as well did a spectacular job.Overall I give this film a 10\/10 and I'm proud to call it my new second favorite film. It is perfect in every way and I recommend this film to absolutely everyone. If you don't enjoy then I must say that you don't see the beauty in simplicity.

The screenplay for this film is a masterpiece and I wish more of them today were like this.The direction for this film also was quite simple, which made it quite brilliant. There are only few films that get me so emotionally attached to their main characters. De Sica does not use complex shots really at all in this film yet I still think it is one of the best directed films ever made. It is hard to describe, the only word I can really think of is pure. De Sica did not direct this film to make money or to win awards, he just directed it because it was what he was born to do.The acting for this film was as well superb. Maggiorani plays Ricci and he is fantastic. He is just a simple man who wants his bicycle back so he can get money to support his family. He is the everyman and Maggiorani played the role perfectly. Enzo Staiola was Ricci's son and he was just the normal kid and he also did his role perfectly. It was like the two of them weren't acting at all they were just that real father and son. The supporting cast as well did a spectacular job.Overall I give this film a 10\/10 and I'm proud to call it my new second favorite film. It is perfect in every way and I recommend this film to absolutely everyone. If you don't enjoy then I must say that you don't see the beauty in simplicity.

The film takes place in modern day Rome , and modern day is in the 40s because that was when the film was made.The film starts off with a man yelling the name Ricci (Maggiorani) who is a person that gives out jobs. Ricci goes to the man and finds out that he is getting a job that pays very well but he needs a bicycle. His bicycle is getting repaired and it is not supposed to be done for a week and he needs it for the next morning. Ricci goes to the repair shot and pays extra to get his bicycle. His wife and son are very happy for him and he is extremely excited to go to his first day of work because he was so unlucky in the past. Unfortunately at his first day of work while gluing posters to the wall someone steals his bicycle. And that is when the chase to get his bicycle back begins...The screenplay for this film received an Oscar nomination which it well deserved, and it probably deserved to win as well even though I have not yet seen the film that did win. The writing was so simple, so pure and that is what I loved about it. It was easy to watch yet extremely thought provoking.

This cannot be an Elm Street movie. This feels more like a spoof of an Elm Street movie. A bad spoof. The Final Nightmare, bullshit. This is Freddy Movie 6.How bad is Freddy's Dead? It's a joke. The whole movie is a joke. It has to be. And it's just plain pathetic, too. I mean, it's so bad, even the puns are stupid (Nice hearing from you, Carlos! give me a break). I can't even start talking about the lack of characterization or bad dialogue. That's a little like saying Yeah, the Titanic did have a bad paint job, didn't it? Watching this film was a strange experience. You know how some people will complain that their favorite book was turned into a movie that left out all the good parts and they felt like the film was in fast-forward? That's what Freddy's Dead feels like. Like the film is in fast-forward. The story goes from event to event so fast that I don't even have time to digest what had just happened. And I have no idea what's going on in the story anyway. It lacks any kind of coherence and flow.It's just so over the top and goofy that I could not take much of this movie seriously at all. Was I suppose to? There is a scene in the movie in which Freddy kills a character by scratching his nails on a chalkboard. The kid's head promptly explodes. In a scene shortly thereafter, Freddy is controlling a kid by using a video game. The kid is bouncing around in reality, complete with BOING! BOING! sound effects. That absolutely cannot be meant to be taken seriously.So, does Freddy's Dead have any redeeming qualities? Believe it or not, yes. Some of the goofy stuff going on actually gets a couple laughs. Not a ton, but enough to make those scenes tolerable. Also, I will say that the acting is, in fact, an upgrade from the previous two movies. Even Robert Englund is a little better here than last time.But that's it. The movie as a whole is borderline unwatchable. Lack of intelligence and general logic makes most of this film unbearable. Oh, and something else that bugged me. A bunch of films that came out in the late 80s and early 90s tried the 3D gimmick. And in a lot of films that tried it back then, most of the 3D revolved around random objects being pointed straight at the camera. It happened here too. And it was really annoying. It does not look cool. And here's something that was the dumbest part of the 3D gimmick in the film, a character actually put on and took off magical 3D glasses to let the audience know when to wear the glasses and take them off. I wish I was making that up. That was as low as Freddy has gotten right there.Freddy's Dead is a mess. This could very well be the worst Elm Street movie. The visuals look bad, the screenplay is beyond idiotic, the characters are stupid, there is no directing style, it's overly goofy, and its best attribute is its incredibly mediocre acting. Freddy's Dead is a nightmare in itself. It is just plain painful.1\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 September 2010","score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" I&#x85; I am confused&#x85; Am I even watching an Elm Street movie anymore?

What is with this guy and his cheesy overblown melodramatic romances? He's making George Lucas look like Shakespeare and James Cameron look like Michael Curtiz. This movie is an abomination. Michael Bay is romanticizing what's happening on Pearl Harbor, using and manipulating this dreadful events for his own advantage to sell tickets. He throws in cliché after cliché and never once tries to tell a story. And he rips off greater directors and their films rather than trying to make his own. For instance, is it just me, or does the dogfight earlier seem vaguely familiar? He's ripping right off Star Wars! I'm not talking borrowing tiny elements or being vaguely familiar, I'm talking ripping right from the movie, almost shot for shot! And even using the same lines! Halfway through this movie, I had to ask myself one question is Bay really using the tragedy at Pearl Harbor as a tool for this romance? I'm assuming he was trying to show how this tragedy affected real people, but this movie is way more about the romance than it is about the bombings! I feel like he *wants* to put the human element in, but he's not! He's completely removing it by giving us so much horrible melodrama. There is just this constant bombardment of melodramatic nonsense! Would it be so much to ask for him to at least stick to one story by the way? Half the time he's giving us this beyond-cheesy romance, but then he'll randomly cut to the Japanese military and US intelligence. Stick to one story! It kind of depletes the purpose of having us fear for the attacks if he's going to show us when and exactly how the Japanese are going to strike. He does not know how to balance the war aspect of this movie with the romance aspect. He either needs to stick to one or the other and not try to do both! And he rips off so many great movies it is pathetic. Bay very blatantly tries to rip off James Cameron's Titanic, Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, and George Lucas's Star Wars. Unfortunately, he has none of Cameron's eye for visuals, Spielberg's finesse with emotion and camera-work, or Lucas's talent for characters and action. And here is something else I noticed while I'm stuck on the director himself he does not give the audience a sense of what it was like to be on board any of the ships before bombing them. So, we don't really feel an emotional connection to the ships or anyone on-board. By the way, Mr. Bay, could you please stop moving the camera? I feel like the movie is drifting away from me!! Now then, as I said before, I don't feel like director Bay or screenwriter Randall Wallace did their military research before starting filming. Did pilots ever play chicken with the enemy? I highly doubt that. And I really hated the way he made the pilots seem stupid, not knowing their right from their left. It is very obvious to me that he did none of the proper research for this movie.Pearl Harbor has one of the worst and most awfully clichéd scripts I've ever heard in my life. These lines that the actors have to say are just plain god awful, no other way around it. I seriously think Bay was trying to squeeze as many clichés as possible into the first half hour. In the first half hour of the movie, I counted no fewer than twenty clichés. I mean, this screenplay was just embarrassingly bad. There's no other way to say it. He should be ashamed of this screenplay.As for the actors in this film, I hated them all. I didn't enjoy watching them on screen, they were stupid characters, and none of them carried any kind of emotional authenticity with them. They were all as shallow and selfish and pitiful as any character I've ever seen on screen. We're given no other reason to care about any of them other than that they are in love with each other.And why does this movie hate women so much? I have never seen a movie that hated women as much as this movie does. All the women in this movie want are men. They joined the military to meet men. And every time we see a woman she's talking about men. Are these women really that shallow? All they ever talk about is sex and men! And then in the operating room, they're all just incompetent and panicky. Why does Bay hate women so much?? Now, I am going to give this movie a point for some pretty decent art direction and visual effects. Doesn't have anything on Saving Private Ryan, though. And I really wish this movie had paid as much attention to its dialogue, story, characters, historical accuracies, and general logic as it does to its effects and art direction.

What is with this guy and his cheesy overblown melodramatic romances? He's making George Lucas look like Shakespeare and James Cameron look like Michael Curtiz. This movie is an abomination. Michael Bay is romanticizing what's happening on Pearl Harbor, using and manipulating this dreadful events for his own advantage to sell tickets. He throws in cliché after cliché and never once tries to tell a story. And he rips off greater directors and their films rather than trying to make his own. For instance, is it just me, or does the dogfight earlier seem vaguely familiar? He's ripping right off Star Wars! I'm not talking borrowing tiny elements or being vaguely familiar, I'm talking ripping right from the movie, almost shot for shot! And even using the same lines! Halfway through this movie, I had to ask myself one question is Bay really using the tragedy at Pearl Harbor as a tool for this romance? I'm assuming he was trying to show how this tragedy affected real people, but this movie is way more about the romance than it is about the bombings! I feel like he *wants* to put the human element in, but he's not! He's completely removing it by giving us so much horrible melodrama. There is just this constant bombardment of melodramatic nonsense! Would it be so much to ask for him to at least stick to one story by the way? Half the time he's giving us this beyond-cheesy romance, but then he'll randomly cut to the Japanese military and US intelligence. Stick to one story! It kind of depletes the purpose of having us fear for the attacks if he's going to show us when and exactly how the Japanese are going to strike. He does not know how to balance the war aspect of this movie with the romance aspect. He either needs to stick to one or the other and not try to do both! And he rips off so many great movies it is pathetic. Bay very blatantly tries to rip off James Cameron's Titanic, Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, and George Lucas's Star Wars. Unfortunately, he has none of Cameron's eye for visuals, Spielberg's finesse with emotion and camera-work, or Lucas's talent for characters and action. And here is something else I noticed while I'm stuck on the director himself he does not give the audience a sense of what it was like to be on board any of the ships before bombing them. So, we don't really feel an emotional connection to the ships or anyone on-board. By the way, Mr. Bay, could you please stop moving the camera? I feel like the movie is drifting away from me!! Now then, as I said before, I don't feel like director Bay or screenwriter Randall Wallace did their military research before starting filming. Did pilots ever play chicken with the enemy? I highly doubt that. And I really hated the way he made the pilots seem stupid, not knowing their right from their left. It is very obvious to me that he did none of the proper research for this movie.Pearl Harbor has one of the worst and most awfully clichéd scripts I've ever heard in my life. These lines that the actors have to say are just plain god awful, no other way around it. I seriously think Bay was trying to squeeze as many clichés as possible into the first half hour. In the first half hour of the movie, I counted no fewer than twenty clichés. I mean, this screenplay was just embarrassingly bad. There's no other way to say it. He should be ashamed of this screenplay.As for the actors in this film, I hated them all. I didn't enjoy watching them on screen, they were stupid characters, and none of them carried any kind of emotional authenticity with them. They were all as shallow and selfish and pitiful as any character I've ever seen on screen. We're given no other reason to care about any of them other than that they are in love with each other.And why does this movie hate women so much? I have never seen a movie that hated women as much as this movie does. All the women in this movie want are men. They joined the military to meet men. And every time we see a woman she's talking about men. Are these women really that shallow? All they ever talk about is sex and men! And then in the operating room, they're all just incompetent and panicky. Why does Bay hate women so much?? Now, I am going to give this movie a point for some pretty decent art direction and visual effects. Doesn't have anything on Saving Private Ryan, though. And I really wish this movie had paid as much attention to its dialogue, story, characters, historical accuracies, and general logic as it does to its effects and art direction. In fact, everything else about this movie is so bad that by the time we get to those scenes, I don't even care about them. And Bay doesn't really give us a whole lot of time to look at them.

It is a successful film. Under the rule of polygamy, the film narrated a tragic story. All the concubines live in a big house, the relationship between these concubines are not good, it bring a lot of strife openly and secretly. Song Lian is the main character of the film, the actress (Gong Li) made a perfect performance. The director Yimou Zhang used the simple scene and language to show viewers a shocking story, and also criticize the rotten old society. I think that the film have a lot of mentionable aspects. First of all, the film is full of Chinese characteristics. In the film, the traditional thought (Confucianism) showed in some plots. The steward always mentioned that all of people should obey the old rules. All the four concubines wanted to have a son. In ancient China, man have important position in a family. All the women should be compliant and loyal to their husband, or they will be punished. The third concubine was hang because of her disloyalty. The whole messuage likes a society, all the people are influenced by old rules, the patriarchy is entrenched. Besides, the costume of the film is filled with traditional element, the messuage is also Chinese outdatedbuilding. The music of the film used a lot of blow and beat mode. In addition, the third concubine performs the Beijing opera, which is traditional Chinese culture. Secondly, I want to say the character of the film and the stage set are well-designed. Especially the role of Song Lian, she is an undergraduate, so she has new ideas in that age. Because of that, in the film, Song Lian did not sit bridal sedan chair, took the luggage by herself, and did not like foot massage. However, as the time going, she became a depraved person. The design of this character highlight the feudal thought has huge influence in that period, even though the educated undergraduate also cannot escape its influence. In addition, the first wife is an old woman, the second concubine is a deceitful person, the third concubine is a singer of drama. These four women have different backgrounds and personalities, these arrangements enrich the storyline. What's more, there are many detailed design about stage set. The four women have different designs of room. The first wife is an old woman, so her boudoir is dark, the furniture is old, and the clothing is fuscous. The third concubine is a singer of Beijing opera, thus her room is full of dramatic element. Thirdly, I think the film has ingenious narrative approach and good foreshadowing. Director made use of the four seasons (summer, autumn, winter, spring) to narrate a whole story. It is simple and clear, but it is quite impressive. The beginning of the film is the dialogue between Song Lian and stepmother, the last words of Song Lian said woman is just like that, and then there are two lines of tears on her face. This scene let audience know the film is about the tragedy of woman. It is also a good foreshadowing for the following story. Besides, the word conflict between Song Lian and Yan'er is also an important foreshadowing for the succedent things.Fourthly, I think the use of long shot, close-up and music make the film more resultful. At the beginning of the film, there is a close-up on Song Lian for a few minutes. With the background of white window, the atmosphere has sense of loneliness and futureless. Director used a lot of long shot and close-up on red lantern, it work in concert with the title of film. In the film, master is a lightspot, as he never has full-face shot. Director through words embody the existence of master. Although we cannot see the face of master completely, the role of master fully reflect the patriarchy, he is a marblehearted people. This is a deliberate arrangement, it can serve as a foil to the dark of feudalism. In this film, a large amount of music is dramatic music. This can reflect the epitasis and the depressive atmosphere of the big house. The sound of foot massage is gripping, the singing of the Mei Shan (the third concubine) is bleak. The combination between lens shift and music make the character and atmosphere very dismal.Finally, I feel the scene of the film is exquisite, it is cinematography. The red lantern plays an important role. When the servants kindle the lanterns, the whole surroundings are full of vitality. However, when the servants extinguish the red lanterns, the whole environment is hopeless and tenebrous. This contrast further highlights the theme of the film. In addition, the scene of the four seasons is true to nature. Especially in winter, the landscape is beautiful, it is like a perfect picture.In a word, the film is well worth seeing. The story, the shoot, the costume, stage set and the music are all art. The film Raise The Red Lantern is a classic work.

This vampire movie was very chilling and exciting. It begins with a teenage boy named Charley Brewster who finds that he is expecting a new neighbor in his town. It just so happens that his neighbor is a vampire. It turns out that this neighbor is also the murderer of several people that recently appeared on the news. Unfortunately, the vampire has a friend that can back him up during the daytime. So when Charley called the police, they of coarse don't believe him. Charley then seeks help from his horror icon Peter Vincent the expert on vampires. Roddy McDowell did an excellent job playing his role as Peter Vincent. He had just of a great personality as the typical Van Helsing in other vampire flicks. This guy is fun, loving, and very intelligent. Overall, the action is fun, the story is pretty sweet, and the special effects and make up are fun to look at. My only regret is looking at those fake teeth. I mean, that is not what charming vampires have. The turned vampires in this film looked more monstrous than human and that just gives too much away. Probably just as bad as Edward Cullen's cover up in the Twilight series. In conclusion, this film is fun to watch and I recommend it to any horror fan. You won't be disappointed.

Charley then seeks help from his horror icon Peter Vincent the expert on vampires. Roddy McDowell did an excellent job playing his role as Peter Vincent. He had just of a great personality as the typical Van Helsing in other vampire flicks. This guy is fun, loving, and very intelligent. Overall, the action is fun, the story is pretty sweet, and the special effects and make up are fun to look at. My only regret is looking at those fake teeth. I mean, that is not what charming vampires have. The turned vampires in this film looked more monstrous than human and that just gives too much away. Probably just as bad as Edward Cullen's cover up in the Twilight series. In conclusion, this film is fun to watch and I recommend it to any horror fan. You won't be disappointed.

This vampire movie was very chilling and exciting. It begins with a teenage boy named Charley Brewster who finds that he is expecting a new neighbor in his town.

Unfortunately, the vampire has a friend that can back him up during the daytime. So when Charley called the police, they of coarse don't believe him.

Peter Gent was a very good possession receiver, great hands, not much speed but definitely an asset to the late 60s America's Team. Nick Nolte portrayed his character Phil Elliott pretty much as he intended. Both G. D. Spradlin and Mack Davis were right on the money as the Meredith and Landry characters, great typecasting and real good direction. The one thing different and that I felt really took away from the main story as it was written was the elimination of the Clinton Foote character, Tex Schramm in real life, and the sort- of breaking up the instances of his character influence onto the owner, his brother and the Charles Durning coach, all of which didn't even come close to the real story. Too bad, it would have been better with someone, say Telly Savalas or maybe Robert Duvall as Clinton. The ending of the book was also considered real shocking along with some of the characters that made it up which was all Hollywood's doing I am sure, and the Delma Huddle\/ Bob Hayes character was also played down except where it was necessary with his injuries and the drama leading up to Nolte's quitting speech B.A., B.A., you, the owners the coaches, you're the team... We're the equipment! One thing I would like to know is if the movie director let Matuzak just take what he always took before his Raider games just to get the real life emotions coming out? Probably not but would still like to know. Bo Svendson was believable as Joe Bob but just barely, his manicured nails gave him away and he just didn't come across too good as an offensive lineman, the muscles just weren't in the right places and neither was the demeanor. Matuzak's pre- game hype up was OK but Svendson's reaction was pretty hokey.

At first a large black stone(?) slab seems to have some important role (first it enlightens some prehumans, then astronauts find it and research about it) then after about one third of the movie we never hear about it again, it loses it's importance in the plot and a completely different story starts. At least this other story makes sense, except for it's ending which is a total nonsense again - even worse than the first part, because here you don't even know what's going on, it's totally random and has not much (as nothing) to do with the story it should end. The parts that worth watching are between the parts I mentioned before. I'll write more about them later. Apart from not making sense this movie will try your patience in other ways too, especially in it's first half. For example the film-score is horrible. Not just because that music sounds very bad, but also because it's style is never appropriate to the actual scene of the movie. For example many times there is a dramatic music when actually nothing special happens. Then there are parts, very long ones in which absolutely nothing happens. You are to watch an empty desert for long minutes, a spaceship docking for at least 10 minutes and probably other such things I don't remember. During these scenes of course you can listen that masterpiece film-score I just wrote about. (Some say that docking scene is the best part because it's so artistic and beautiful - well maybe I would agree with them to some degree if it wasn't longer than 2 minutes, but too much is too much!) Now let's get back to the part I wrote about that it worths watching. It's the part which pictures a space mission to some distant place (I don't remember where) - hence the title. It is surprisingly realistic there is weightlessness everywhere in the ship except for a large block witch rotates to provide gravity; outside the ship(s) there is gravely silence, the route takes years - so most of the crew are hibernated; and when a TV station from Earth makes an interview with the (awake) crew members they tell the viewers that it takes minutes for their question to reach the spaceship (and also the answer to reach Earth). They must have used some experts to design this, it totally lacks those fancy but unrealistic stuffs we got used to in the modern sci-fis. If this was the whole movie it would worth much more than like this. But it gets screwed too when the computer, Hal makes a small mistake and many very illogical decisions ensue from both its and the crews part!
