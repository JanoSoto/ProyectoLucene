You REALLY have to be familiar with the material being spoofed, though.  And part of the fun is ticking them all off in your mind if you're a movie geek like me.NATM has two levels and target audiences. For teens who have seen all the recent flicks, it's a direct, Mad magazine style parody. For 30 somethings like me, it's an homage to the 80's flicks. The opening scene is an obvious American Pie spoof, but in a much more subtle way, it's drawing on Sixteen Candles. To top it off, the scene is still funny even if you haven't seen either targets. Bruce (Sam Levine from Freaks & Geeks) is a parody of Seth Green's character in Can't Hardly Wait, but he's also an homage to Long Duk Dong.Several people have mentioned that kids probably haven't seen the old flicks and older people haven't seen the new ones. Well, if you're a kid, you don't need to have seen the old flicks to appreciate it as a broad parody. The 80's jokes tend to sit in the background- like the signs on the walls and the musical cues in the Molly Ringwald scene (which actually was a weak point IMO). And I've found that most people my age HAVE seen most of the newer teen movies. They came out just about the time we were starting to get married, buy houses, have real jobs. And they were a nice bit of nostalgia for our youth. Even if we didn't go pay $7.50 to see them, we've seen them on USA on saturday afternoon.It's no accident the that soundtrack is almost entirely new, young bands doing covers of 80's songs.As far as the gross-out factor goes, it's really not that bad. The filthy opening scene is forgivable because it's so dang funny. There is one gory joke on the football field. (A Lucas homage inside a Varsity Blues parody.) A sick unfunny scatalogical joke at the beginning of the movie pays off with a big laugh when it's turned around at the end. And the mother of all poo jokes is tempered by the fact that the victim is a delivering a tirade against poo jokes. And then there's granny's kiss- unfunny and nasty. But it's nowhere near the level of Scary Movie. It's also nice to see a movie like this without any gay jokes or fat jokes. (There is a fat guy, but being fat isn't the joke.) Under the filth, this is a pretty gentle movie.I avoided this when it came out, but another 30-something friend recommended it to me recently.

You see where this is going?  It's like this film was written, shot, and edited in Arkansas--everyone is freakin' related to a previous film somehow. Halloween 6 has more plot dependant coincidences than the entire Friday the 13th series (and that is really freakin' impressive.)  Ooh, and let's not forget the cued lightning which reveals Michael outside the window at just the right moment.  Yeah right, I buy that . . .During the total 15 minutes where the film is not busy explaining something Michael or thorn or one of it's ungodly number of coincidences, you have stale Friday-the-13th-ish stalking sequences or (even worse) or the good guys doing something stupid.

Producer's Cut has the -real- music.This film might be worth watching again if I found out director Joe Chappelle made a cameo to get killed by Myers.

If any actor made Halloween, it was Donald Pleasance.On my closing note, it's funny that Halloween came first--Friday the 13th cheaply imitated Halloween.

Up until the early 90's kids were happy to be frightened because it was about being alive and honest, without the fear that evil truly did reign the Earth. It was optimism and how it related to human darkness.  Moreover it was about how Goth had come back in style, the education in literary background that came with it. There was a lot of culture behind black attire and make-up of this time- whether it was referenced to writers, music, religion, or just pure romantic love.That's where this film comes in. Its theme-love conquers all- is not about romance-but about true LOVE. This film is all about staying true to the essence of its theme. If you're talking about love during this time(1992-4), you're not talking about any areas around it- like romance, lover's quarrel, jealousy, self-doubt. It's not about enhancing the faces of your film's attractive leads; Brandon Lee's face is mostly covered in make-up and similarly Sofia Shinas is barely shown, but when she finally is it is only her face-she is more like an angel than an attractive woman. Point being that everything needed to make an action\/horror film was there. But it's like the director wanted to show how he deliberately ignored these aspects and remained loyal to his theme.Sarah and Officer Albrecht are plot thickeners and serve to give the film a modern perspective, so they are shown as realistically as possible. But all the bad-guys are purposely unrealistic, they are shown as symbols for you to HATE-out of pure emotion. You don't want them in the slammer, you want their evil out of this world.This film is like a landmark in a temporary (American-I can't speak for other countries) pop culture between 1992&4.

Financial gain\/monetary value was shunned during this short-lived culture, because it didn't have to do with human emotion.

This is the time when nothing was trivial-the important stuff mattered, a feeling to which music of the time consequently made a huge impact. Nothing was done without thought, so words could make you fall in love or cry.If there ever was a film that could reflect this confusing and beautiful revival of the Romantic Period, The Crow is the movie.

Nothing was done without thought, so words could make you fall in love or cry.If there ever was a film that could reflect this confusing and beautiful revival of the Romantic Period, The Crow is the movie. It will take you back. This is the only film that I wish could've lasted longer.

While this will of course lead to criticisms from some, I find it refreshing that PJ was willing to take such a risk. I have lost count of how many times I have watched this movie but I never get tired of it and the effect it has upon me is never less than when I saw it for the first time. I am so thrilled that these movies have introduced Tolkien to an entirely new generation, one that probably would never have heard of LOTR if a movie hadn't been made. My hope is that these movies will inspire people to return to the books because there is still a certain magic within them that can never be fully captured on screen (although PJ has come pretty close). If the two sequels live up to this first intsallment, then The Godfather movies will have a serious rival for the greatest trilogy of all time!

Bully is a total masterpiece, that's the only word to describe it. Kids was one of the rawest and the most startling, amazing and confusing films of the 1990's. It was also one of the greatest movies about a purposeless lifestyle of a modern misfit youth ever created. I watched it numerous times and I still haven't grew tired of it.What Larry Clark did with his magnificent directorial debut he succeeded to do for a second time. I never doubted it, I knew Bully had to be good but it was way, way better than I ever expected. Actually it was nearly as good as Kids. Knowing what a classic Kids nowadays is to me it's hard to say this but in some ways Bully was even better. This film gives you the same kind of a strange after-taste. At least to me it gave the feeling that I should watch it again right away. The scenes and the dialogue stayed in my mind days and days after.The fact that this is a true story makes the experience even more shocking. Bully (just like Kids) also includes an incredibly black and creepy type of a humor. Audience will have to deal with a big matter of conscience is it all right to laugh at this? And another thing how did Larry Clark once again found such a huge bunch of fantastic young actors\/actresses is beyond me! Nick Stahl (whose breakthrough role was beside Mel Gibson in The Man without a face) gives an excellent performance as Bobby. Larry Clark tries to drop hints that in many ways he's actually the sanest one of this gang so what does a closer look at him tell about the other kids...?Leo Fitzpatrick comes back 6 years after Kids playing wonderfully the role of the hitman. He's character is simply hilarious. At first I didn't even recognize him, I just wondered why he looks so damn familiar. Michael Pitt played one of my favorite characters, Donny. His splendid performance shows us just how pitiable and simple-minded today's child can be. He's like Justin Pierce's Casper in Kids. Bijou Phillips and Rachel Miner played the leading female roles successfully and with a massive devotion.Of course I understand people who don't appreciate Larry Clark's extreme way of filmmaking but I do because he doesn't underestimate the viewer but shows all there is to see no matter how shocking it may be. Bully is a weird and powerful sensation and one of the best films of 2001! 10\/10.

It had an exciting beginning, but then it got stupid. Why would the soldiers waste their RPGs(Rocket-Propelled Grenades) on a school? Even how the Soviets invaded the United States is stupid. They get into the USA on Airliners. Wouldn't air traffic controllers notice that there were a few thousand extra airplanes on radar? And how did they get all those airplanes past Western Europe. They couldn't do it by the Pacific, because the US has several territories and one state there. And why wouldn't Western Europe help? They owe it to the US for their help in WWI and WWII. Also, the Soviets knock out the Nuke silos in North Dakota and they destroy a few major cities. The US still would have hundreds mobile nukes all around the country which they wouldn't hesitate to use if the Soviets nuked US cities. The Soviets also kill 400 million Chinese. The only way they could do that is with tactical nuclear warfare. The Chinese also have nukes and would be able to nail Moscow. This story also describes the Russians as merciless, and they really aren't(especially since most of this movie took place when Gorbachev was in power).The General Plot is dumb. It taught me that if I would gather all my friends and equip ourselves with hunting rifles, we would be better than a Soviet armored cavalry division. I won't deny that the action sequences are good, but they don't make up for the stupid plot.Though my IMDB name is Boris, I'm not a Russian, and am not giving this movie a poor review because you might think i am.

The mistake and campy nature of Forever to the power of two.  I'm surprised I didn't see POW appear on the screen when Batman or Robin punched a no name henchman.  Another reviewer called this film one long Toy Commercial--that about nails it.  We don't have characters, we don't have sets, we have dull director Joel holding plastic toys in front of the camera and doing all the voices himself.  Help me Batman!  Help!  Oh noo!Everyone's whining about Clooney's performance of Batman\/Bruce Wayne; that's saying Clooney had scripted material to act or improv from, which he did not.  It doesn't matter who plays Bruce Wayne in this film--Bruce Wayne's screen time can be cut from this film entirely and it won't effect anything in terms of character development.  It would barely dent the plot development.  Keaton, Kilmer, or Clooney, I really didn't care who filled the role.  Maybe if there *was* a role to fill I would actually start caring.The Batman character has lost the Dark Knight sense about him and comes across as a step below a model showing off skin tight rubber suits.  Oh, and Schumacker films Batman and Robin in such a way that you wouldn't be surprised to find the Dark Knight and sidekick moonlighting in a male stripper act in a nightclub off 3rd street.

Batman is running out of steam. There's nothing left, not even the special effects that they display through the bulk of the film.  They don't even hold your interest.
