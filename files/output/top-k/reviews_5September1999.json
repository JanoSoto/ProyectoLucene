This movie suffers from the typical book-to-movie conversion problems, mainly trying to jam a long, and very cerebral book into a watchable 2 hours.  A lot of the scenes were of course cut out, and many of the plot mechanics were simplified.My opinion is that the movie is excellent, and provides a Dune fan a great way to visualize the setting, characters, and other elements of the novel.The special effects are very lame, I must admit.  Back in 1984 they might have been somewhat passable, but by today's standards they look very unrealistic.  Thankfully the personal shield effects are only shown in one or two short scenes.  However, this film does not particularly rely on special effects, so this fault is forgivable.There is also a bootleg 4-hour version of the movie, often falsely dubbed the Director's Cut.  In reality this cut of the film had nothing to do with the director.  In fact, David Lynch demanded his name be taken off of the credits of the 4-hour cut.  An Anti-Director's Cut if you will.  I think the 4-hour version does a better job explaining the story, both with added scenes and a different as well as longer introduction.  Of course if you hated the 2-hour version, sitting through a 4-hour version probably isn't on the top of your to-do list.Regardless of what opinions you might hear, this film is truly a classic.If for no other reason but because this is an original concept for a film, the likes of which you will not see anywhere else.Overall, I recommend this movie to fans of the novels, and sci-fi fans of all types... but you may love this film or you may hate it.  It's one of those types of movies.  When I first saw this movie, I hadn't even heard of the Dune novels.  I admit I was confused by the film, but I was intrigued by it.  So I went out to the library and checked out Dune, then later purchased the entire set of books.  Once I had read through the first book, I watched the movie again and absolutely loved it.Dune has also inspired a couple of exceptional video games that I would recommend to anyone who enjoyed the books or film.

It also completely lacked the emotional impact of the first in every single way possible. All throughout the first crow i was immersed within the story of Eric Draven avenging the rape and death of his fiance'. It was such a stunning performance you could actually feel the anger and longing exuding from the character. City of angels does its best to pull out an emotional impact of the murder victim in such a cheap way of it being a child and it's father.In the area of villains, instead of the truly twisted character of Top dollar from the first film, we receive a sadistic and stereotypical villain that portrayed such cheapness that you could only find elsewhere on the WB or UPN at 2 in the morning. I couldnt have cared less about the characters and only sat through the film to truly witness in it's entirety of how much it did its best to defimate the first one.

Her sonic scream allows her to get what she wants; it is almost as if the laws of physics and psychology are thrown out the window for her.  On the other hand, fate plays a major role.  She either gets somewhere too late or someone briefly prevents her from moving on (i.e. the security guard).  In addition fate plays on the lives of the people she runs into.

This shows that fresher talents can make their way up in the movie business without necessarily belonging to certain cliques.  However, `Blair Witch' and the public's response can also mark the beginning of a trend in film making that I find to be fundamentally bothering for two intertwined reasons.  First, it represents for me the most blatant way in which television has affected and even invaded cinema.  Second, it represents the extent to which the audience's perception of reality, affected by television, has changed over the years to become something unreal. The Blair Witch Project is about three film students who are filming a documentary in the woods of Maryland about the Blair Witch, a local myth who as legend has it has kidnapped seven children in the 1940s.  We learn right at the beginning that the students have disappeared and that a year later the footage they have shot was found.  The Blair Witch Project is therefore the story of their disappearance, as filmed by the characters using a 16mm camera and a video cam recorder.  The fundamental problem starts here.  Though a work of fiction, The Blair Witch Project tries to openly touch our voyeuristic desires in order to lure us into the film, the same way reality shows do on television in a moment you will see how a certain event ended in tragedy.   At first glance there is nothing wrong with this.  We might even congratulate the Blair Witch Project for its honesty.  Unlike other films it admits more openly to the fact that there is a touch of voyeurism in our film watching experience, and that, like any other film, it is a window onto another world we believe to be real.  However, I find that there is something dishonest about this attempt.  Like every other film there are people who are behind the camera.  Like every other film the people behind the camera try to make the audience forget that they are there.  But the Blair Witch Project goes the extra length to achieve this.  And it is with this extra length that there is a problem.   The only reason the audience believes the Blair Witch Project to be more realistic than other films is because its perception of reality has been greatly shaped by the diffusion of video technology and the proliferation of reality shows.  If these two events had not happened the reaction of the audience would have been twofold.  First, it would find ridiculous that three individuals under ominous threat would keep on shooting what is happening to them.  Second, it would find the grainy images of the video cam recorder and 16mm camera less realistic when compared to 35mm.  Lets suppose for an instant that an individual, who had never seen a film nor watched television before, was asked to compare the Blair Witch Project with any other film shot on 35mm.  That individual would probably believe that the 35mm is a more accurate reproduction of reality.  It is, therefore, very sad that after all the advance that has been made in film technology audiences and critiques alike would find, what represents a regression, to be more realistic.   How did all this happen?  It has to do with television and the growing trend in exhibitionism and voyeurism that it has brought about.  It started with the fascination that people had in seeing shocking scenes from across the world and it culminated when average individuals started to shoot embarrassing moments of their lives and tragedies around them, to be broadcast on national television.  One might claim that this is real life that they are filming and therefore a more honest documentation of our period than a work of fiction.  The argument can be made in this case.  But the Blair Witch Project is an elaborate work of fiction.  Therefore, its use of the fascination that people have in filming their own lives and peeping into the others' represents the invasion of cinema by television and the perception of reality it has created in the audience's mind. I have wondered whether the Blair Witch Project might be a statement on these developments rather than a symptom.  The fact that the characters go on filming everything that happens becomes an issue between them at one point, during which we learn that filming has a comforting effect on one of them.  But other than that there is no substantive evidence to that effect.  One other possibility might be that the Blair Witch Project is playing with the audience.  It may be attempting to create the uneasy feeling in the audience's mind that it has done and felt something disturbing when watching the film, without making a clear moral statement.  Many directors such as Cronenberg or Lynch often do this brilliantly.   If this is the case why has the Blair Witch Project been unable, at least in my case, to create this feeling?  Cronenberg and Lynch are able to achieve this feeling because the universe they create is not one-dimensional.  In Cronenberg's Crash we see the superimposition of the human flesh with machines.  In David Lynch's Blue Velvet we see the superimposition of innocence with evil.  This enables viewers to feel that they have participated in the violation of something they believe to be important, in the above cases sexuality and innocence.  The universe the Blair Witch Project creates however is one-dimensional.  It is the characters that have decided to film everything and it is the same characters that will go on exhibiting themselves, for no particular reason but the sake of shooting.  In this case all the audience can do is watch and The Blair Witch Project becomes the medium it may or may not try to criticize.
