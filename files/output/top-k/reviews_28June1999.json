I kept returning to a comparison of the other kids come home for another painful thanksgiving with the people you feel you have outgrown movie, Home for the Holidays.  The Myth of Fingerprints was much darker, and in that way a little more real.  No slap stick or cotton candy can be found in this film.  However, this can also be looked at as a detriment.  Other than an old movie shown twice in the film we see no evidence that this family ever liked, or even had any sort of playful feelings for each other.  The joking atmosphere that mists about most families is conspicuously absent in this movie.  So much so that you are nearly shocked to see Warren (Noah Wylie's character) attempt to comfort his sister Mia (Julianne Moore)when she is so obviously upset by something. You expect him to do as the rest of the family did  leave her there. They try to be a family.  Warren, Leigh, and their mother (Blythe Danner) are the most accessible of this wacked out crew seeming to be the most feeling and tender.  The father, Hal, and Mia are emotionally unavailable and distant, but Mia shows glimmers of hope every once in a while especially in her exchanges with her brothers and childhood sweetheart.  Hal on the other hand remained a complete mystery to me.  We see him trying to steal his son's girlfriend in one scene and watching home movies getting teary eyed at the sight of his young children in the next. I was barely aware that the eldest brother Jake was in the film, he was of little consequence but for one scene with Mia which is cut short in favor of sex with his girlfriend. They were all such very different people with one important thing in common.  They loved their family and had no idea why.  I think that's what it comes down to for all of us.  After leaving home the first time we come back we look around and think, Who the hell are these people?  I don't know if we ever figure out the answer to that question ever again.  But I do know that one day, years after we asked it for the first time, we realize that whether we know who they are or not they are part of us and we love them.  Even if we have to confront them, dislike them, or are forced to sever ties with them.  It's just the way it is.  You have to remember the good things.

Something that would give the audience goose bumps was in order, but bigger bumps must have been the goal.  Hitch had to use his TV crew (from his network series Alfred Hitchcock Presents... because many film executives didn't like the material.  Little did they know that the big Brit was about to make a cinematic milestone and change the way films are structured and material is presented.  At the time, PSYCHO was a nasty-spirited movie that led some moviegoers to leave early or stop taking showers.  It has held up amazingly well and is far superior to its countless rip-offs.PSYCHO is perfect because 1) It is in black and white, not blazing technicolor which would have stained the film for no purpose and made the shower murder less artistic. (Hitch may have went the route of director Michael Powell who became an outcast once his technicolor murder flick PEEPING TOM was seen.)2)The featured star disappears a third of the way through igniting a new method of scriptwriting and casting.  (Hitch made strict stipulations for theatre owners not to allow people into the movie once the picture started in order for this secret to stay secret.)3)Lesser known actors are used to provide a more authentic feel for the characters.  This is so true in the case of Anthony Perkins, not exactly a Cary Grant, who creates a stunningly chaotic portrayal of an abused son\/mental madman. (Hitch shoots him from tilted angles and shadowy atmospheres to project Norman Bates' unquestionably distorted state of mind, not to mention his evil grin.)4) The shower scene, of course.  Never before in any film of any kind known to man had people seen such frightening butchery and frank brutality. (Hitch storyboarded each of the 80+ cuts that take place within the 2 minute segment.)5) Norman Bates' mother, who sits upstairs in the old house on the hill and just watches what transpires when she's not taking part in it.  (Hitch makes her a mystery until the very end when she is finally revealed to us and to Vera Miles in a masterfully shot turn of a chair.)6)The set-up and payoff which consists of 40,000 dollars, a device common in most thrillers but new to this kind of psychological terror.  (Hitch makes the viewer think the 40 grand will be the staple of importance and plot when it really disappears amidst the horror and has no significance at all.)7)Finally, composer Bernard Hermann's famed musical score is a pulsating, vibrant piece of gothic composition that matches the story and character actions perfectly.

(Hitch shoots him from tilted angles and shadowy atmospheres to project Norman Bates' unquestionably distorted state of mind, not to mention his evil grin.)4) The shower scene, of course.  Never before in any film of any kind known to man had people seen such frightening butchery and frank brutality. (Hitch storyboarded each of the 80+ cuts that take place within the 2 minute segment.)5) Norman Bates' mother, who sits upstairs in the old house on the hill and just watches what transpires when she's not taking part in it.  (Hitch makes her a mystery until the very end when she is finally revealed to us and to Vera Miles in a masterfully shot turn of a chair.)6)The set-up and payoff which consists of 40,000 dollars, a device common in most thrillers but new to this kind of psychological terror.  (Hitch makes the viewer think the 40 grand will be the staple of importance and plot when it really disappears amidst the horror and has no significance at all.)7)Finally, composer Bernard Hermann's famed musical score is a pulsating, vibrant piece of gothic composition that matches the story and character actions perfectly.  (Hitch and Hermann worked on several films together, none better than this.)Is there any other question that PSYCHO is one of the top 7 or 8 films of all time?  I don't think so.  Just look how film history began a slow course towards more independence and honesty after PSYCHO scared everyone into believing this kind of film could be made.RATING 10+  ","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"28 June 1999","score":"65 out of 75 people found the following review useful","review":"  Once again, a film of such glory fell on deaf ears - no pun intended - in  this country.

Because this film is about as intense as they come. Granted, it lacks in the personal relationships and that is what made Jaws such the classic that it is. We all know that there is no way a sequel to Jaws could ever live up to what we experienced with Jaws, but this film is about as scary as they come.Here, I must admit that the characters take a back seat to the shark. But is that necessarily wrong? We have already seen the shark in the first one so the mystery is gone, so now the only thing to do is make sure the audience is scared out of their minds. And that I can assure you is done with just as much perfection and attention to detail as the original. Take for example the opening scene where two divers are looking in the Orca ( Quint's sunken ship from the first film ). They are playfully taking pictures in front of the sunken ship. Then suddenly, a shot from behind them, and the ominous music. You know they are going to be eaten, but the scene is done with so much tension and perfect pacing that you are scared all over again. And when the shark finally does strike, we experience that primal emotion all over again.The story is a fairly simple one but affective at the same time. Brody ( Roy Scheider ) is convinced there is another shark in the waters off Amity and he is having a hard time convincing the town idiots that he is right. But this time his two sons are a little older and they will be involved in the final confrontation with the shark.There is one other scene that I wanted to point out and that is a scene where a picture is being developed. Brody is given a camera of the missing divers from the beginning. The developer then tells him that the pictures are about to be processed. As he stands in the red room, waiting for the pictures to develop, he knows. He has that feeling. Something is going to show up on the picture. And sure enough we see it. The mouth. The black, doll-like lifeless eye appears in the corner of the frame and Brody knows. He knows what it is. This is such a powerful scene in the film and it is directed with such skill that it looks like it could have been directed by Spielberg. I think Jaws 2 is a great film and it is just as scary if not a little scarier than the first, but what it lacks is that it's characters don't have time to develop. We don't care as much about these ones as we did about Hooper and Brody and Quint to some degree. But that is a small detail, because the film does it's job and that is to scare us. Look for one more scene where Tina and her boyfriend are boating by themselves. It will stay with you for quite some time.Maybe if this was Spielberg's film he would have done something different. But the one thing he couldn't do is to make it more of a frightening experience than it is. So that is a compliment to Szwarc, I just wonder what happened to him. Because he has a vision and a style that is very reminiscent to Spielberg's original. If you haven't seen this by now, treat yourself to the first one and then watch this one right after. Especially to all the young people that are on the IMDb, Jaws is a classic piece of film making and I have said that it is the best film ever made, and it is. But if you want to be scared, Jaws 2 will fulfill that need just as well as the first and better than any film that has come out in the 90's.And finally, has there ever been a better tagline in the history of motion pictures? Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water...... Brilliant.

Films in the 80's like Fast Times, Wild Life, Revenge of the Nerds and Ferris Bueller's Day Off and such, were films that may not have been classics to the critics, but to a fifteen year old boy, they were our Citizen Kane.  They taught us how to pick up women, how to attempt to have sex, how to skip school and why to skip school.  They taught us that parents and adults really don't understand us and that kids really aren't that bad, we just want to have a bit of fun before life gets too serious.  We have all been through emotions and experiences like the ones that those movies preach about, so it is easy for us to relate to what those films are trying to say. And it makes it that much more fun to relive those experiences ten years later.  Can't Hardly Wait is the closest to an 80's teen film that I have seen in quite some time.  Compared to films like the aforementioned Never Been Kissed and even She's All That, this movie is a classic.The film was written and directed by Harry Elfont and Debra Kaplan, and if they are not about my age ( late 20's ) they certainly are lovers of 80's teen films, because it shows here that they did their homework.  Some of the scenes in this film are complete homages to great 80's films like Sixteen Candles ( the two geeks on the roof ) Wild Life ( a huge party where some of the characters grow up and learn a bit about themselves and each other) and even Say Anything ( a not so popular guy in love with the school hotty.) It seems to me that Harry and Debra are lovers of the films that made growing up in the eighties so much fun.The story is about a party on the day of the completion of exams.  Here we meet all the major players in the film.  And yes, they are all contrived, but that is what a film like this is about.  They were not trying to re-invent the wheel here, they were trying to stick to a formula that made so many movies work. You have Amanda Beckett ( Hewitt ), the prom queen that just got broken up with by the star jock named Mike Dexter ( played with so much zeal by Peter Facinelli, look for him to have a future in Hollywood ).  Then you have Preston ( Ethan Embry ) who is not necessarily a geek but he is far from a popular jock, think of Dawson.  Anyway, he has loved Amanda for all of highschool and now he is finally getting the guts to tell her of his undying passion for her.  You also have William Lichter, who is the school geek that comes of age in the party.  He does all the things that you would expect a typically written geek in a film to do--- get drunk, have a public display of wildness that gets people to see him in a new light, and of course, in here it is his karaoking to Paradise City ( which is one of the film's funnier scenes ) and of course get laid.  As I said, this movie sticks to a very popular formula.  Don't look for a film like this to say new and something profound about today's youth.  This movie is here to entertain and that is it.  And it does that well.Also you have Kenny Fischer ( Seth Green ) as a very white guy who thinks he is black to cover up his insecurities, and his friend from public school named Denise.  Needless to say many issues are going to be raised at the party and some of them are hilarious.A great cameo is turned in by Jerry O'Connell who plays Trip McNeely ( the ultimate jock name ).  He was idolized by all the cool kids when he went to their high school.  Now he is in university and according to him , in a converstion with Mike Dexter, he tells him that  guys like me and you bro are a dime a dozen.  Chicks are a lot different in college.

Films in the 80's like Fast Times, Wild Life, Revenge of the Nerds and Ferris Bueller's Day Off and such, were films that may not have been classics to the critics, but to a fifteen year old boy, they were our Citizen Kane.  They taught us how to pick up women, how to attempt to have sex, how to skip school and why to skip school.  They taught us that parents and adults really don't understand us and that kids really aren't that bad, we just want to have a bit of fun before life gets too serious.  We have all been through emotions and experiences like the ones that those movies preach about, so it is easy for us to relate to what those films are trying to say. And it makes it that much more fun to relive those experiences ten years later.  Can't Hardly Wait is the closest to an 80's teen film that I have seen in quite some time.  Compared to films like the aforementioned Never Been Kissed and even She's All That, this movie is a classic.The film was written and directed by Harry Elfont and Debra Kaplan, and if they are not about my age ( late 20's ) they certainly are lovers of 80's teen films, because it shows here that they did their homework.  Some of the scenes in this film are complete homages to great 80's films like Sixteen Candles ( the two geeks on the roof ) Wild Life ( a huge party where some of the characters grow up and learn a bit about themselves and each other) and even Say Anything ( a not so popular guy in love with the school hotty.) It seems to me that Harry and Debra are lovers of the films that made growing up in the eighties so much fun.The story is about a party on the day of the completion of exams.  Here we meet all the major players in the film.  And yes, they are all contrived, but that is what a film like this is about.  They were not trying to re-invent the wheel here, they were trying to stick to a formula that made so many movies work. You have Amanda Beckett ( Hewitt ), the prom queen that just got broken up with by the star jock named Mike Dexter ( played with so much zeal by Peter Facinelli, look for him to have a future in Hollywood ).  Then you have Preston ( Ethan Embry ) who is not necessarily a geek but he is far from a popular jock, think of Dawson.  Anyway, he has loved Amanda for all of highschool and now he is finally getting the guts to tell her of his undying passion for her.  You also have William Lichter, who is the school geek that comes of age in the party.  He does all the things that you would expect a typically written geek in a film to do--- get drunk, have a public display of wildness that gets people to see him in a new light, and of course, in here it is his karaoking to Paradise City ( which is one of the film's funnier scenes ) and of course get laid.  As I said, this movie sticks to a very popular formula.  Don't look for a film like this to say new and something profound about today's youth.  This movie is here to entertain and that is it.  And it does that well.Also you have Kenny Fischer ( Seth Green ) as a very white guy who thinks he is black to cover up his insecurities, and his friend from public school named Denise.  Needless to say many issues are going to be raised at the party and some of them are hilarious.A great cameo is turned in by Jerry O'Connell who plays Trip McNeely ( the ultimate jock name ).  He was idolized by all the cool kids when he went to their high school.  Now he is in university and according to him , in a converstion with Mike Dexter, he tells him that  guys like me and you bro are a dime a dozen.  Chicks are a lot different in college.  They care about the environment and things and they all date guys that are in pre-med.  It is a very funny scene.What makes this movie so much fun to watch is that it is reminiscent of an 80's film.  And that is the highest compliment that I can give it. Because, just like they don't know how to make movies like Halloween and Nightmare On Elm Street anymore, they sure as hell don't know how to make films like Breakfast Club, The Sure Thing and Secret Admirer.  But this film comes really close to being like those.  And if you remember those ones as films that were some of your favorites when you were sixteen, see this, it will make you laugh and entertain you, and that is an accomplishment on its own.

It is a poorly made film, and a failed experiment in filmmaking.Sometimes it is best to get to the point early on, and so I have attempted to do just that in this review.  If the makers of Limbo had kept to that idea, they could have saved themselves several million dollars and thousands of people would have 2 1\/2 hours of their lives to spend in better circumstances.  Alas, it was not to be, so audiences will pay for their mistake.Depressingly, Limbo isn't just a bad movie; it is two bad movies.  The first revolves around a small Alaskan fishing town that is at the end of its spool.  The cannery is closing down and the fishing business itself provides only a risky living for those desperate enough to take their chances with its financial and physical risks.  One of those desperate souls is Harmon King, a down-and-out former fisherman looking to return to his old trade. Sadly for him, he owes a large amount of money to the local lodge owners, who have repossessed his boat.  They have hosted a wedding for the daughter of a tourism executive's daughter, which is being worked by handyman Joe Gastineau, torch singer Donna De Angelo, and Donna's daughter Noelle. Donna has the audacity to dump her bandmate\/boyfriend onstage at the wedding, which is a good example of the selfishness that has estranged her from her daughter.  She hitches a ride into town with Joe and they begin an intimate relationship, while Donna ignores the continued warning signs that her daughter is slipping into serious depression.  Meanwhile, we meet the local bartender, keeper of sea stories, and also watch Harmon fight with Frankie and Lou (the lodge owners) over his boat.  They have lent the boat to Joe so that he can return to the sea 25 years after having two friends die while out with him on a fishing trip.  And finally, enter Smilin' Jack, the bush pilot Romeo with an eye for Donna and a dislike for Joe.Did you get all that?  It doesn't matter because, 90 minutes into the film, all but three of the aforementioned characters are erased from the movie. Even the histories of the characters kept on are eradicated.  It is as if they never existed, and the film begins again, this time centering on a sea jaunt by Joe, Donna, Noelle, and Joe's brother Bobby into the backwaters of Alaska's islands.  Bobby doesn't tell his passengers, but he is meeting some drug kingpins whose dope he lost and who are out for revenge.  When the meeting turns fatal, the three passengers must hide on a deserted island with little hope of rescue and winter closing in.  Slowly, ever so slowly, the drama of three hopelessly stranded people plays out, as anger, lust, and vulnerability each take their turn in the castaways' lives.It is apparent that writer\/director John Sayles wanted to make a non-traditional sort of film, and he succeeds.  That is the only measure of success in the film, however, as some film making conventions should be followed.  Such as finishing any storyline that is started, or not creating ridiculous situations in order to squeeze some sort of character building through adversity out of your stars.  The dismissal of the entire first half of the film before any resolution makes the film seem overlong, and is wasteful of any emotion imbued in the characters discarded.  Likewise, once you have placed your chosen characters in adversity, it would help to allow some development by them, or give a reason why they are still the small people they were to start with.  The only personal discovery by the stranded family is that Noelle is an extremely gifted if morose storyteller; Donna doesn't notice that her emotional abandonment of Noelle has sparked her daughter's lonely talent.I feel I must add some meta-review here.  Several hundred other people and I were treated to free passes to this film.  I can honestly say that I have never seen so many people walk out in the middle of a free movie as walked out of Limbo.  As the film dragged on the remaining audience sank lower into their seats, muttering disparaging comments, and generally suffering the annoyance of an excruciatingly slow film.  In fact, I wish I had thought, the only way this film could get any slower is if the film broke, because, two hours in, the film broke.  Normally when the film breaks during a screening there is a lot of booing and hissing, and general disappointment amongst audience members.  When the film broke during Limbo there was a palpable wave of relief that swept the audience, with laughter and high fives passed around.  A number of moviegoers resembled prisoners who have noticed the prison guard's back has turned and made good their escape. And finally, once the film was restarted and the inconclusive end reached (which is supposed to place you and the cast in limbo, get it?  Wakka wakka wakka) there were people asking for free passes to another movie for sitting through the torture that is this film, and they got in for free.

The Martian, who is in human form plus antennae, can't leave the Earth because his spaceship has broken down.Walston turns up again in this film, again as a Martian but only peripherally this time; a hang around Martian, only serving to bring on vague feelings of nostalgia, yearnings for the simpler days of very expensive black and white, valve driven televisions and gentlemanly behaviour. There's little of the charm of the TV series in this film version.Walston's part is taken by Christopher Lloyd (the madcap scientist in the Back To The Future films) and the Bill Bixby part is played by the nearly always good Jeff Daniels (Dumb And Dumber).Christopher Lloyd's hyperactive portrayal of Uncle Martin is the problem with My Favorite Martian, a performance more reminiscent of a Looney Tunes character rather than the well mannered, concerned spaceman we were treated with years ago. It must  be supposed that every other character in the film measured and toned itself against this  new manic Uncle Martin.If there's any truth in that old adage delivered to children about not pulling faces in case the wind changes then Lloyd is in grave danger. And so must be Jeff Daniels  (I wonder if he drinks Jack?) My Favorite Martian wasn't entertaining, even if you weren't around in the sixties. Subtlety is appreciated even by children.In fact almost no one at all will enjoy My Favorite Martian unless perhaps a minority of minors, but who's going to bother to take them? There are a couple of entertaining moments, one involving a fat arse and a 1962 Plymouth Valiant, the other to do with a particularly loathsome digital monster, but that's all.Then there's Elizabeth Hurley, delivering her usual English version of a big haired American bimbo. Her attempts at acting have of late become even more frantic and embarrassing. Check out this effort along with the ones in Ed TV and Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me to see what I mean.And My Favorite Martian manages even to be more offensive. At one stage Hurley has been tied to a chair in a room. The obnoxious baddie called E. Coleye (get it) played by Wallace Shawn locks himself into the room with her to do what? It wasn't funny. It wasn't mentioned again.Then there's the digital character Zoot, the Martian's space suit who develops a thing about washing machines. He was just plain boring even if he was well wrung.

Check out this effort along with the ones in Ed TV and Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me to see what I mean.And My Favorite Martian manages even to be more offensive.

The Martian, who is in human form plus antennae, can't leave the Earth because his spaceship has broken down.Walston turns up again in this film, again as a Martian but only peripherally this time; a hang around Martian, only serving to bring on vague feelings of nostalgia, yearnings for the simpler days of very expensive black and white, valve driven televisions and gentlemanly behaviour.

We also know that the acting is not the most important feature on this flick. As a member of the audience I felt like trying to erase what I have seen in the star wars trilogy but some how the images and charm of those movies simply could not match here. Something is missing. Obviously its a new beginning but is more than that what bothers me. Its that the characters are not spherical in any scense. Darth Maul for starters. he is amazing, but I could not believe that he went as fast as he came. Ewan's Character is very close to the Idea that i had about Obi Wan in his youth, maybe it will all be compensated in the next two films for him. Anakin's lines are so superficial that makes a terrible mistake the connection with our galaxy, a thing that did not happen in the other movies. I think that George Lucas was so concentrated in his digital domain of visual shock that he did not pay attention to the acting. Somehow the movie's best moments are those involving less acting and more action, like the pod race and the gungan war againts the battle droids. Now, thats very impresive enough. Yes, but why as a fan I feel...not as happy?. From the fan point of view I can forgive star wars' Darth Vader so insecure and lacking of the real darkness he represents in Empire Strikes Back and Jedi, and so I will forgive the duh personality young anakin has, and that Jar Jar Binks does not make me laugh, on the contrary he will not be as memorable as Chewbacca or the ewoks them selves.

True, John Carpenter's Halloween came out two years before and established the slasher movie, but blame Friday the 13th and its sequels for creating the 80's horror flick. Gore, gore, teenage sex, gore, and little suspense. I love the Friday the 13th series in a really twisted way. There's just something fun about watching obnoxious teens played by terrible 30 year old actors getting killed one by one. they're tacky, trashy, mindless entertainment and they are always fun to watch with a group of friends, unlike say, Schindler's List.The first of the Friday the 13ths is not my personal favorite, but it has some good points. First, it establishes the tone for the whole series and introduces the Jason Voorhees legend. Secondly, it has gore and mindless killings galore. And third, it's fun to watch.In case you don't know the plot, here's a rundown. On Friday the 13th in 1958 at Camp Crystal Lake two camp counselors are stabbed to death just as they are about to have sex. Fast forward to the present day (actually 1979) and it's June, Friday the 13th. Camp Crystal Lake is about to reopen despite the rumors that there's a death curse and the warnings of the town crazy, Ralph. So a bunch of counselors is helping getting the camp ready and then the power goes out on a rainy night and guess what happens? Yeah, the counselors are all killed one by one except for the smart virgin, Alice. But who's killing everyone? And why? Enter Mrs. Voorhees who is there to help Alice or so she claims. When a character is introduced in the last 20 minutes of a horror movie, they are either the murderer or a police officer trying to set things right. Since Mrs. Voorhees is not a law enforcement officer, guess which one she is? So anyway, Mrs. Voorhees relates to Alice the story of Jason. Apparently, Jason was at Camp Crystal Lake in 1957 a young happy boy swimming. He drowned because two camp counselors were too busy making love to pay attention. Mrs. Voorhees was the cook when this took place and is now taking revenge but she thinks she's Jason and talks in his voice. It's kind of like Psycho in reverse. So Mrs. Voorhees avenges her son's death by killing every camp counselor and anyone who wants to re-open the camp simply because she lost her only child (who as we later learn, isn't her only child, but I digress).What I love about this movie is the cheesy film stock. They didn't use any lighting for this movie and you can tell. That's only part of its corny charm. It's also neat to see Kevin Bacon before he was famous. He's always fun to watch especially when he's talking to the cop who thinks he's been smoking pot. This movie pretty much sets up all the slasher movie clichés horny, stupid teenagers; clueless, disbelieving police officers; psycho killers; teens smoking pot; GORE!; and the townspeople who always try to warn the innocent teens.I love Crazy Ralph in particular because the actor hams it up so much. After Ralph leaves the flick, we get a lot of routine killings. The movie doesn't really pick up until the end when Mrs. Voorhees shows up and all is explained. The fight between her and Alice is the stuff corny horror movies are made of. Though not the best of the Friday series in my opinion, it's definitely better than a lot of the other special day slasher flicks of the 80's (especially April Fool's Day).My Favorite Death Kevin Bacon's arrow through the throat.Grade B (Mind you the criteria for rating a horror movie is much different for that of oh, say, Schindler's List) ","genre":null},{"date":"28 June 1999","score":"","review":"  This is the one that started it all.

There is absolutely no evidence that there is a God or an afterlife. But that hasn't stopped me ( and billions of people ) from believing in something.

The Prophecy tells us that there is, but it is not necessarily that cut and dried. The ruler of hell in this film is more like a character in a Martin Scorsese film. He is evil ( he has to be, he is Lucifer ) but he is not necessarily here to make God's life miserable. He is not necessarily good, but he is in a self serving kind of way.The Prophecy is a very confusing and convoluted but brilliant film. The story ( bear with me here, it's been a while since I've seen this film ) is about a war between angels. Some angels became jealous when God decided he loved humans more than them. They become bitter and decide to start a war in heaven with the angels that are loyal to God. Their theory is that if the angels that oppose them are gone, they can take over certain things and hopefully get God's love back. To do this, they must steal the soul of the most heinous person that ever lived. We meet Gabriel, the lead angel in this crusade, and played by Christopher Walken, he is one of the most entertaining characters I have ever seen in the history of film. He has a sense of humour, he is vicious and he uses humans as slaves to do his dirty work. He catches them just before they are about to die and uses them with the promise that he will kill them once their job is finished. Here we meet Jerry, as his human monkey,and the only reason I mention this is because it is one of Adam Goldberg's early roles. He was Upham in Saving Private Ryan and watching this you could tell he had talent and that he would go places. He is fantastic in this film.Elias Koteas plays Thomas, the only one who may have an insight into what is going on. He was a former priest who understands how religion is playing a part in all of this.Eric Stoltz plays Simon, one of the good angels that is trying to save the world from Gabriel and he is very affective here as well.But the star of this film is absolutely Walken. He is perfect as Gabriel. He has a sense of humour and he is evil at the same time. And in some ways you are rooting for him to win. That is until the very end when Satan shows up, because he steals every scene he is in as well.Satan is played with wicked slickness by Viggo Mortensen. When he speaks he almost slithers and creeps his words onto the screen. He makes a dark scene darker and he keeps you glued to the screen. And his role in this film is one that epitomizes convolution. He is awesome.This film is one that should not be missed. If you don't understand everything about it the first time, watch it again and again. You'll learn something new every time. And you'll enjoy it more and more. This is one hell of a film!!

Based on the stylistic opening credits, I was expecting to be assaulted with low-angle extreme closeup murky cinematography designed to capitalize on human reflex. American film has been thwarted with bad technique in the suspense\/mystery genre.  Instead of style and creativity, many directors have opted for the ole standby of loud unexpected noises\/music followed by the alerting appearance of the villain.  Snore...However, such is not the case with David Fincher's Seven.  The style of Seven is fairly straightforward for the first seventy minutes of the film  What you see is what you get. Unapologetically grotesque images from the crime scenes of a serial murder and a flood of rain in a dingy, dirty-textured metropolitan city.  The plot is nothing we haven't seen before, but it was plenty enough to keep you interested in learning about the murderer.  However, the main characters could not have been more contrived.  Morgan Freeman's character, Detective Summerset, was catatonic to the point of being convincingly dull.  The writer went for the starkest contrast with the character Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) by giving him the playground mentality of hockey player turned homicide detective.  The results were destructive to the film's effect. In the end, Mills and Summerset do their best to ruin the audience's interest in their involvement.  Gwynneth Paltrow would receive mention if her character weren't a mere fixture within a plot.  The characters just didn't help this film at all.  It was one of those all too often cases where the actors look the part but the part is badly written =(  However, much to the credit of the production designer and cinematographer, the mood of this film was still very effective.  There was however one other regrettable inconsistency  For the first seventy minutes or so of the film, the audience forcably endures the foul, wet and lonely darkness of the city environment only to have the rug pulled out in the closing moments when the setting changes to a sun-bleached desert scape.
