Some are good, but won't change your life (The Messenger, October Sky), some are very good (Man on the Moon, Girl, Interrupted), some are excellent (Election, Eyes Wide Shut). But every now and then comes a movie that defy your intelligence and turn into something totally unforgettable. Psycho, 2001 A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, The Godfather, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Schindler's List, American Beauty... Magnolia! It's strange to put a just-released film between so many classics (yes! American Beauty is an instant classic). But, thinking a little, that's where Magnolia belongs to. So what makes it so wonderful, so vibrating, so peculiar? That's what I'll try to answer.Do you believe in coincidences or do you think things happen for a reason? The original, darkly humorous prologue gives an  interesting hypothesis about that, telling three different cases of death in which amazing coincidences happen. The three men hanged, the scuba diver, the suicide turned into a homicide. You start to see that this won't be an ordinary picture. After that, while Aimee Mann's song 'One' plays in the background, we are taken to a street called Magnolia, in the San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles. There is a TV turned on and we can see a commercial where a chauvinist guy is advertising a help phone number for desperate men. A TV is also turned on in a bar, where an addicted girl meets a guy, and they soon go to her house to have sex. There is a mini documentary on TV about the life of Jimmy Gator, the presenter of a very famous TV show. Donnie Smith took part of this show when he was a kid, on the '60s, but nowadays he doesn't seem to have good luck. A smart kid and his rigid father are late to leave home. A good looking woman is tired of her much older husband's disease, or of something else. His nurse is a much more helpful man. And there is a police officer, who also seems to be tired, but of his job. It is a fast-paced mosaic, as fast paced as a MTV video. We think they are all ordinary people... and they are. What make these characters so special is that they are very well developed, as we rarely see in American movie. But what will happen in the next 24 hours? The weather schedule predicts rain.The police officer is Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly), who is sent to a woman's house, where he finds out that she has killed the man who lived with her. The addicted girl is Claudia Wilson (Melora Walters), daughter of Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall). When he visits her in the morning she just throws rocks at him, even after he reveals that he has cancer. Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) is also dying of cancer, on his bed. He reveals to his nurse Phil (Philip Seymour Hoffman) that he has a son who doesn't speak with him. His name is Jack. No, Frank Mackey... Frank TJ Mackey (Tom Cruise) is giving another of his lectures to men, throwing all his rocks at women. His aim is 'Seduce and Destroy'. Donnie Smith (William H. Macy) is being fired of the store he works at, but he needs money to put braces on his teeth. Stanley (Jeremy Blackman) is an amazingly intelligent, peculiar child, who takes part at Jimmy Gator's show. The rain begins and he started to be prepared to win. Linda Partridge (Julianne Moore) is not taking control of her feelings. She married Earl for money, but now she finds out that she loves him. She is totally desperate. She wants to change his will, or to do something else. Kurring visits Claudia because of a neighbor complaint and an attraction appears between them. Frank gives an interview, and the reporter asks him about his past. Phil tries to contact Frank. Donnie suffers because of a homosexual love. Jimmy starts to suffer from his disease during the show. Stanley suffers from his father's pressure and can't even go to the bathroom. Earl is dying. Linda wants to kill herself. Everyone gets desperate. Many revelations are made, about mistakes of the past. Other coincidences happen. The night comes. At some moment, all the characters sing Aimee Mann's 'Wise Up' (another audaciosity of Paul Thomas Anderson, which goes perfect). But... Something happens. Something unexpected, surreal. Frogs... falling from the sky! An illusion? Or was it real? We don't know. Only the characters can see it. And the conclusion gives you a hope. A sweet hope.Director Paul Thomas Anderson could have stepped wrong many times, but he doesn't. His film is wonderful, perfect. It's an exotic box of surprises. It is about loving people, forgive the ones who hurt us, have love in our lives. The theme of love and hate is used during the whole 3  hours. And what wonderful 3 hours! The film is not slow; it is original and keep the audience close to the characters' personal dramas. Everything here is a gift. There are Aimee Mann's songs, which are part of the story. Without them, the movie wouldn't have been so perfect. 'Save Me' should have won the Oscar. (Well, I won't even discuss about the Oscar snub to this film) The acting is another gift. If I talked about the whole cast, my comment would be too big and the IMDb wouldn't accept it. But let me talk about two of them Tom Cruise and Julianne Moore. Cruise gives the best performance of his career. He is cynical, arrogant, perverse, but suddenly turns into a fragile person. And Moore surprises us once more. The pharmacy scene will remain in my mind for a long time, just because of her.PT Anderson can build a very different film from the excellent Boogie Nights. Here he has Robert Altman as a base, specially Short Cuts. But, believe it or not, his film is superior. He builds a mosaic of characters, but God is one of the main themes. Yes, the rain of frogs comes from the Bible, Exodus 82. It was audacious, but it just turned the film more intriguing. Just as a curiosity, the words Exodus 82 appear in some places during the film an outdoor, written on a bill a person is holding at the show audience, etc.Magnolia is not just amazing because of Exodus 82. It is a complete, complex picture. I had great expectations about it, and they were all filled. On my comment of American Beauty, I said it was maybe the best picture I had ever seen. No, it's not. 2001 is still up there. But maybe Magnolia is even better than American Beauty. Not the best film I've ever seen, but certainly one of.

It is a complete, complex picture. I had great expectations about it, and they were all filled. On my comment of American Beauty, I said it was maybe the best picture I had ever seen. No, it's not. 2001 is still up there. But maybe Magnolia is even better than American Beauty. Not the best film I've ever seen, but certainly one of. ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"13 May 2000","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Rating **** out of ****WARNING SPOILER ALERT- IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS AMAZING FILM YET, PLEASE DO NOT READ MY COMMENTEvery year comes a load of terrible movies (The Mummy, The Blair Witch Project), some bad ones (Jawbreaker, American Pie), some simple movies (10 Things I Hate About You, Forces of Nature). Some are good, but won't change your life (The Messenger, October Sky), some are very good (Man on the Moon, Girl, Interrupted), some are excellent (Election, Eyes Wide Shut). But every now and then comes a movie that defy your intelligence and turn into something totally unforgettable. Psycho, 2001 A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, The Godfather, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Schindler's List, American Beauty... Magnolia! It's strange to put a just-released film between so many classics (yes! American Beauty is an instant classic). But, thinking a little, that's where Magnolia belongs to. So what makes it so wonderful, so vibrating, so peculiar? That's what I'll try to answer.Do you believe in coincidences or do you think things happen for a reason? The original, darkly humorous prologue gives an  interesting hypothesis about that, telling three different cases of death in which amazing coincidences happen. The three men hanged, the scuba diver, the suicide turned into a homicide. You start to see that this won't be an ordinary picture. After that, while Aimee Mann's song 'One' plays in the background, we are taken to a street called Magnolia, in the San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles. There is a TV turned on and we can see a commercial where a chauvinist guy is advertising a help phone number for desperate men. A TV is also turned on in a bar, where an addicted girl meets a guy, and they soon go to her house to have sex. There is a mini documentary on TV about the life of Jimmy Gator, the presenter of a very famous TV show. Donnie Smith took part of this show when he was a kid, on the '60s, but nowadays he doesn't seem to have good luck. A smart kid and his rigid father are late to leave home. A good looking woman is tired of her much older husband's disease, or of something else. His nurse is a much more helpful man. And there is a police officer, who also seems to be tired, but of his job. It is a fast-paced mosaic, as fast paced as a MTV video. We think they are all ordinary people... and they are. What make these characters so special is that they are very well developed, as we rarely see in American movie. But what will happen in the next 24 hours? The weather schedule predicts rain.The police officer is Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly), who is sent to a woman's house, where he finds out that she has killed the man who lived with her. The addicted girl is Claudia Wilson (Melora Walters), daughter of Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall). When he visits her in the morning she just throws rocks at him, even after he reveals that he has cancer. Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) is also dying of cancer, on his bed. He reveals to his nurse Phil (Philip Seymour Hoffman) that he has a son who doesn't speak with him. His name is Jack. No, Frank Mackey... Frank TJ Mackey (Tom Cruise) is giving another of his lectures to men, throwing all his rocks at women. His aim is 'Seduce and Destroy'. Donnie Smith (William H. Macy) is being fired of the store he works at, but he needs money to put braces on his teeth. Stanley (Jeremy Blackman) is an amazingly intelligent, peculiar child, who takes part at Jimmy Gator's show. The rain begins and he started to be prepared to win. Linda Partridge (Julianne Moore) is not taking control of her feelings. She married Earl for money, but now she finds out that she loves him. She is totally desperate. She wants to change his will, or to do something else. Kurring visits Claudia because of a neighbor complaint and an attraction appears between them. Frank gives an interview, and the reporter asks him about his past. Phil tries to contact Frank. Donnie suffers because of a homosexual love. Jimmy starts to suffer from his disease during the show. Stanley suffers from his father's pressure and can't even go to the bathroom. Earl is dying. Linda wants to kill herself. Everyone gets desperate. Many revelations are made, about mistakes of the past. Other coincidences happen. The night comes. At some moment, all the characters sing Aimee Mann's 'Wise Up' (another audaciosity of Paul Thomas Anderson, which goes perfect). But... Something happens. Something unexpected, surreal. Frogs... falling from the sky! An illusion? Or was it real? We don't know. Only the characters can see it. And the conclusion gives you a hope. A sweet hope.Director Paul Thomas Anderson could have stepped wrong many times, but he doesn't. His film is wonderful, perfect. It's an exotic box of surprises. It is about loving people, forgive the ones who hurt us, have love in our lives. The theme of love and hate is used during the whole 3  hours. And what wonderful 3 hours! The film is not slow; it is original and keep the audience close to the characters' personal dramas. Everything here is a gift. There are Aimee Mann's songs, which are part of the story. Without them, the movie wouldn't have been so perfect. 'Save Me' should have won the Oscar. (Well, I won't even discuss about the Oscar snub to this film) The acting is another gift. If I talked about the whole cast, my comment would be too big and the IMDb wouldn't accept it. But let me talk about two of them Tom Cruise and Julianne Moore. Cruise gives the best performance of his career. He is cynical, arrogant, perverse, but suddenly turns into a fragile person. And Moore surprises us once more. The pharmacy scene will remain in my mind for a long time, just because of her.PT Anderson can build a very different film from the excellent Boogie Nights. Here he has Robert Altman as a base, specially Short Cuts. But, believe it or not, his film is superior. He builds a mosaic of characters, but God is one of the main themes. Yes, the rain of frogs comes from the Bible, Exodus 82. It was audacious, but it just turned the film more intriguing. Just as a curiosity, the words Exodus 82 appear in some places during the film an outdoor, written on a bill a person is holding at the show audience, etc.Magnolia is not just amazing because of Exodus 82.

Jim can attest to my aversion to camerawork of this type. Just give me a bucket.  Other than the occasional blotchy camera-footwork, this is a fascinating look at an event which occurred during the Roman Empire.  Although not historically accurate and, from what I gather, deliberately inaccurate, we are swept away in the stunning cinematography, the lavish sets, the extensive use of CGI that melds almost seamlessly with the real (except for the tigers, I heard that they were real and really hungry too!) and the dramatic intensity of the story.  We are introduced to Maximus (Russell Crowe), a general  and confidante of a Roman emperor (played by a near-dead Richard Harris), who's life is completely turned around in a web of jealousy and treachery (beautifully done by Joaquin Phoenix).  We watch as he tries to regain his life and exact revenge on those who caused him to go from a respected general to a slave to a gladiator in the Arena games.  The fight scenes are spectacular and gory - definitely not for the squeamish. I know that more than a few will love the Amazon Women archers  in the Coliseum games (right, Jim? ).   The drama as seen through Russell Crowe's eyes is touching and has given me a better respect for this actor.  Kudos to Derek Jacobi and the now very dead Oliver Reed.  The latter playing his last role magnificently (I almost didn't recognize him).  I have heard this film likened to Braveheart, Spartacus and Ben Hur.  And definitely not to be viewed on mere videotape. This must be seen on a big screen.  No two ways about it. Although if I really wanted to be in the middle of a war, I could probably just go outside the theatre to the nearest Macayo's Mexican Grill's Cinco de Mayo celebrations, but I think I prefer the splendour of Ridley Scott's newest foray in history-fiction.

Although not historically accurate and, from what I gather, deliberately inaccurate, we are swept away in the stunning cinematography, the lavish sets, the extensive use of CGI that melds almost seamlessly with the real (except for the tigers, I heard that they were real and really hungry too!) and the dramatic intensity of the story.  We are introduced to Maximus (Russell Crowe), a general  and confidante of a Roman emperor (played by a near-dead Richard Harris), who's life is completely turned around in a web of jealousy and treachery (beautifully done by Joaquin Phoenix).  We watch as he tries to regain his life and exact revenge on those who caused him to go from a respected general to a slave to a gladiator in the Arena games.  The fight scenes are spectacular and gory - definitely not for the squeamish. I know that more than a few will love the Amazon Women archers  in the Coliseum games (right, Jim? ).   The drama as seen through Russell Crowe's eyes is touching and has given me a better respect for this actor.  Kudos to Derek Jacobi and the now very dead Oliver Reed.  The latter playing his last role magnificently (I almost didn't recognize him).  I have heard this film likened to Braveheart, Spartacus and Ben Hur.  And definitely not to be viewed on mere videotape. This must be seen on a big screen.  No two ways about it. Although if I really wanted to be in the middle of a war, I could probably just go outside the theatre to the nearest Macayo's Mexican Grill's Cinco de Mayo celebrations, but I think I prefer the splendour of Ridley Scott's newest foray in history-fiction.

Cinco de Mayo celebrations are in full force here in Phoenix.  Cinco de Mayo is the Mexican equivalent of St. Patrick's Day with the exception that these celebrations include firing guns in the air all night So we reacted to these events in the usual way.  We went to the movies!!Gladiator  (Ridley Scott)  Starring Russell Crowe and featuring a bevy of faces we know and love. Written by David H. Franzoni and John Logan, with perhaps half a dozen or so screenplays between them.  The ones that stand out either for being memorable or awful are Bats, Amistad and RKO 281.It's generally known that Ridley Scott doesn't take his filmmaking lightly. Let me go a bit further and say that Ridley Scott disembowels you with the intensity of his craft.  Oh God! I just looked at my hands and I've bitten my nails down to the quick.  I hate it when I do that. This film grabs you from the very first scene, as we are witness to a spectacle of a battle that turned a little too Blair Witch-y for my taste.

I had heard universally negative reviews about the film, so I expected it to be bad. However, it was not as bad as some movies I have seen. True, this film is by no stretch of the imagination a good movie, but they way people have criticized it, you would think it was no better than some of the straight to video tripe that surfaces in obscure corners of the local Hollywood Video or Blockbuster. If this movie would have been made for cable, and would have wound up on HBO late one Friday night, I think people would have thought better of it. Instead, it is a bad B movie trying to make it in a summer of many potential A movies. After seeing Gladiator last week, this film reminded me of why Hollywood has gone down hill since the epics of the forties and fifties. However, I don't think it is fair to compare the two. Fans of the book will be inevitably disappointed. I never finished reading the book, but I can tell you that many things had changed from what I saw. I don't expect anyone to be able to take a book like Battlefield Earth and do the movie justice. It was written on such a huge scale that it would be impossible. The story followed a similar arch, with some of the events being as I remembered them, but they added and changed much. John Travolta did a decent job as the main bad guy, and I had to like his performance. He was so ridiculously over the top that he constantly brought a smile to my face. Barry Pepper as Johnny Goodboy Tyler was a different story. He was excellent in Saving Private Ryan, but made a bad choice for his first major follow-up. The special effects, which have become almost standard in Sci-Fi fare, are not bad, but not the quality of recent big movies like Phantom Menace. And that is not to say that Phantom Menace was good, but it DID have some incredible effects. The fighter combat scenes at the end of the movie were well done and had a few pleasant surprises in them. Of course, special effects should not have to carry a movie on their shoulders (like they did with Phantom Menace, which would have been a really clunker if the effects weren't so good). I would not recommend this movie to the casual viewer, but as a fan of B movies, and cheap sci-fi in particular, I am not disgusted by it. Of course, I was not entertained much by it, either. If you have nothing better to see, and Gladiator is sold out, and you're significant other is at away and you have to see a movie, this will kill time.
