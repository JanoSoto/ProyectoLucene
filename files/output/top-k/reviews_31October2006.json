I am not Catholic, but can't they come up with a better plot than this? And if you are going to do an Evil Catholic Church movie, perhaps, just maybe you could have someone on your writing staff who has a clue what goes on in the Catholic Church? I have studied Aramaic and the writing was NOT Aramaic or even close. There was more Thebian script (a ceremonial magic script) than Aramaic, which has no vowels, and therefore no one knows what it sounded like when spoken! There is one small group in the Middle East who does speak a modern derivation, but it is even more different than the Aramaic of Paul's time than Old English would be to us today (Chaucer is Middle English and many of us had to suffer through trying to read it in school).The Eucharist always involve the Host, and the drinking of the wine (blood) is generally optional, yet here they showed people taking the wine without the Host. I know they were trying to make a point, but to anyone with a clue they shot themselves in the foot.The acting was terrible, the writing was awful (maybe it was not the acting ... perhaps they did the best with what they were given) and the plot is tired. The sets were nice, but that isn't enough to hold my attention.I cannot believe people think this is a classic ... I would prefer the original Omen if I am going to see an Evil Church movie. This was better than The Convent, at least, the parts without Adrienne Barbeau, but only because they had a budget and didn't try to have special effects.

I watched it at 10 o clock on my own last night and it was the first horror film for a while that genuinely had me shaking in some parts.First of all, the camera effects is fantastic. If you go on you tube or whatever and see some peoples homemade movies about crap, then you can understand what these 3 kids are doing. Just doing it for a little fame.This film isn't like 1 of those Oh- let's- go- and- go- to- that- haunted- house- in- the- middle- of-nowhere- because- its- funny horrors. The acting is superb and heather Donahue puts in an amazing performance as she is hopelessly lost as the environments around her start affecting her mind. This is what would happen to anyone lost in a supposedly haunted woods. The mystery factor is all ere in TBWP as even until the ending, you are still guessing what\/why these things have happened. It was only when i was brushing my teeth earlier when i realised why mike was in the corner at the end.Overall, this is a cracker and it probably in my top 3 horror movies, the acting will blow you away, the mystery will mess with your mind and the intenseness will chill you to your bones.Happy camping!

But somehow this one doesn't get entangled in that equation. A glancing blow, generationally speaking, with enough empathy on both the impossibility and surprising opportunities of going back home. The hard-side to the plot somehow stays in the fiction section, while a life-redeeming relationship looms real. I must be in the target zone, as the strongly period soundtrack pushed all the buttons on my recollection of T minus 10 years (probably 20 by the time you read this). Strange that my own children found it equally entertaining - they're a tough crowd. Some great humor, quirky characters, happily ever after, and close enough to my favorite movie ever. Which is surprising, given that I just grabbed it, unaware, off the Ex-Rental On-Sale shelf. Oh, and listen up for those bits of rapid-fire dialog.
