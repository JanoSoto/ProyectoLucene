While I was hoping to be dumbfounded by the end of this film by amazing cinematography and story, I actually lost focus on this film. For some strange reason, this film just didn't speak to me. Perhaps it is because there are handfuls of films with similar themes that have been done so much better. I was expecting a deeply depressing drama by the likes of which I have never seen, instead what I was handed was a cornucopia of bland over-dramatic cinema. It just felt like Egoyan was trying too hard. I think he knew what he wanted to accomplish, and the idea sounded great in his head, but sadly when he transferred it to the silver screen, it just didn't seem to match. This was a tough story to watch, and I could tell that Egoyan was having trouble behind the camera. The feeling of continuity, solidarity, and character structure was definitely missing from this film. To begin, I didn't hate this film. I thought that some of the actors did a decent job in front of the camera giving performances that I had not seen from them before. I am a fan of Bruce Greenwood's work (the little that he does), so it was impressive to see him branch out and explore his acting possibilities. Coupled with the overall depth of the film it did raise the bar a bit, but not far enough for my enjoyment. When Egoyan should have been showing us more of the meat of the story, he instead was overloading us with elongated images of actors crying, wandering, or just muttering off into the distance. I couldn't tell where Egoyan wanted to go with this film. Was it to be something that intellects would grab a hold of because of the conversations, or the drama saps because of the structure of the film? This should have been better defined by Egoyan, but instead we are left with too many clues without enough story.This is best shown by the ending. When Egoyan was trying to surprise us, it was instead a huge lackluster that forced us to wonder why we waded through an hour and a half of dribble just to seemed shocked by the ending. I agree, I never saw it coming, but that was because no clues were given to me to help me see the ending. I felt that Egoyan was grabbing at nothing, pushing characters together that did not really have to go together. I needed to see more interaction with the characters instead of just what happened with Greenwood's character. When you are looking to make film of this structure, it is always good to not focus on just one character. While one will stand out, it should be left up to the audience to make their decision on whom they like the most, unfortunately, Egoyan tagged early on that Greenwood would be the center of this story. This then caused the other characters to fall into second place and not get the screen attention or development that they deserved. We can see this with the confusing story that takes place. I mentioned this before, but I think Egoyan had a great idea, but could not translate it to the screen. What was the reasoning behind Eric and Exotica's owner's pregnancy? Why did Christina and the owner kiss? What ever happened to Christina and Eric's love? What truly happened between Francis and his brother? These were all questions that were never answered at all during this film. It was as if there was another story before this on and we were not given any of it to see. We needed to see more of the pre-story instead of what was given to us in the end. This would have helped build a stronger ending. Overall, I wasn't impressed. I didn't think it was bad, yet I wasn't blown away by it. I think that Greenwood is a great actor and did wonderful in this role, but sadly I couldn't attach myself to him because I was too confused with the story. Maybe I am wrong, buit it seemed like there were unanswered questions just left on the table throughout the film.

The film had some memorable scenes etched in my mind and, I thought the film was an intense, well-crafted thriller. After reviewing it again, I realized the only scene which really stuck with me was the bizarre tent scene and that makes perfect sense considering my age then. What I DID forget is just how awfully bad a film this one is. I mean it is a stinker! Where to begin...the story is about mutated salmon that are eaten by prehistoric-like fish that quickly evolve into man-sized creature from the black lagoon\/alien ripoffs. These monsters are plentiful and have only one goal to capture as many girls in a bikini and have sex on the beach to procreate in order to create more mutant fish people. Fish people having babies with real people despite any biological problems that might arise(no pun intended). Hmm. Next, add Doug McClure, Vic Morrow, and Ann Turkel into the mix. None of them great actors...not bad either when they have some decent direction. Not evident here. Morrow overacts, McClure is over his head when he is the lead, and Turkel is less than mediocre. One scene really showcases her talent. The scene where she is in the lab telling us how much she has fought to bring the news of the superfish out is one of the finest pieces of bad acting I have seen in a long time. It is almost an inspiration for everyone else in the film to do likewise. Director Barbara Peters really seems to set out to be solely exploitative and there is nothing wrong with that if you can do it well or with a point. I mean her producer Roger Corman did it all the time. Here plot, acting, and all those other qualities that make a movie good are secondary(or tertiary) to gore, violence and nudity. Peters does do some things fairly well. The pacing of the first three-fourths of the film is rapid and there are some well-shot scenes of menace.

When I first watched this film more than twenty years ago, the terror and horror were not due to the double-mouth or the creepy thing with the prehensile tail. The gut-splitting scene was horrifying but not the best. I experienced the terror because Scott was careful enough not to show the Alien too many times. In fact, only towards the end you get a good look at the thing. At other times, it is for the fraction of a second, no more. During the entire length of the film, you know that this thing is somewhere in the ship, may be in the engine room or may be in the accommodation, it can be anywhere. But you do not know it until you come face to face with it, and when you do, you are dead. It is classical horror, not the blood and gore\/ face-with-third degree-burns formula that we see today. The suspense and the wait for the inevitable to happen- that sums it up. And then, like all great horror films (I do not know if I should really classify this as a horror film), that feeling in your stomach as you wonder if anyone in the crew will survive to get back at the monster at all! Scott is excellent (and perhaps one of the few remaining in the English cinema) at using light. See his Duellists, Blade Runner and even that commercial Gladiator. Scott was an understudy of Kubrick and it shows in his films (I believe Jan De Bont was an understudy of Scott in turn, but in my view De Bont does not make good films. Period!). He uses light (or the lack of it) to the maximum effect throughout the movie, and space as the setting for the movie helps him. Whether it is the stranded ship (the one that sends them the SOS), or the inner recesses of Nostromo, it is the blend of shadows and twilight that drive the horror and terror of the movie. Good acting and script too helped. There is no excessive bonhomie or rivalry among the seven astronauts, they are friendly with each other but also professional. That makes the script more credible than its sequels. There are also minor twists in the plot along the way (for those who have not watched the movie and still are happily unaware, do follow the dialogue and scenes carefully from the time they receive the SOS, and see how the scientific officer does it) for those who follow these things but they do not detract. They add to the excitement and horror. Finally, this film is genuinely Sci-Fi.Sequels followed, glorified by cover stories in national magazines. But none of them comes close. Aliens was made by Cameron, and it is more of a western set in space, with the good, the bad and the ugly clearly defined; there are no shades of grey. In fact, I do not understand why characterization is needed in such movies. You can make a good movie of this sort without imparting too much character to anyone or making a villain out of some hapless Yuppie. But then Cameron has no subtlety or art , and I do not much like his work. To date I fail to understand how Aliens became such a huge success. It probably appeals to the popcorn masses. About the third and fourth films in this franchise, the less said the better. More recently, there was this hit film on predator versus alien. In the interests of art and taste, such films should be boycotted by the general public.

I really liked the way Joe's REAL thoughts and feelings were portrayed in the interview scenes with the angel of death, and how these were blended with the REAL scenes of his day to day life as choreographer. The dance routines were expertly performed - I especially liked the one that his daughter and one of his girlfriends did at the house.His wife still loved him despite his screwing around, and of course his daughter loved him unconditionally. An interesting insight into Joe's personality was provided by the relationships with the different people in his life - wife, daughter, sleeping partners, dancers, business managers, doctors...I like it better each time I see it.
