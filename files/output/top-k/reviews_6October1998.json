[{"date":"6 October 1998","score":"","review":"  John Dahl's Rounders portrays (whether accurately or not is beyond me) very vividly the world of underground poker in the United State's upper east coast through a story not-so-typical of the archetypal hero.  Mike McDermott is a reformed gambler who turns in his chips for a degree in law, only to be forced back into the clutches of the game when he vouches for his best friend.  The parolee in turn leaves him high and dry with a $25,000 debt and a poker game with the KGB as his last resort.  It's a high stakes thriller combining a fancy poker glossary with some true professional history and a plot so thick that even Matt Damon's charm can't slice it.But I wish to comment on Dahl's portrayal of Levien and Koppleman's masterfully written script as an anti-hero-tale released in a time when happy endings and big budgets seem to gross more than good movie making does.  This unpredictable and yet very powerful plot manifests several identifiable depictions of anti-Hollywood inferences, all of which can be divided into `plot-determining' or simply `authentic.'  I'll focus on just one example of each, in an effort to keep this article brief (and under 1000 words!).`Authentic' refers to small, sometimes unnoticeable parts of the movie that, although they make no difference in the plot, disclose the attitude of the movie.  It's clearly not a Top Gun or Titanic by any means&#133;the good guys don't wear white hats, and he doesn't always get the girl.  Another poker movie of the decade was Maverick (Gibson, Foster), a western comedy about a card shark bound for the big game.  For Hollywood's sake, Maverick wins the final game with, what else, a Royal Flush, when he dramatically tosses the final Ace of Spades onto the chips&#133; after having played it blind of course. But Rounders depicts a much different final show down.  McDermott is at the table not because he needs to win his money, but because he's in a pissing contest with KGB (Malcovich).  He wins not on a royal flush, but by outplaying his opponent and knowing the game, and by winning the `staring contest' that proves to be so dramatic.  This authenticity provides a more credible plot, while at the same time produces a certain aura about the viewer; that this is not a Hollywood film, this is a film for rounders, who can respect (italics) that win, and can appreciate the depth of the game. It is this authenticity that unfortunately sometimes turns viewers away (my date was bored out of her mind because she just didn't get it, though she loved Maverick), but at the same time adds a dimension to the film that is unparalleled by any box office smash with tuxedos and gold chips.On a larger scale, the `plot determining' authentications truly make Rounders sit alone amidst few other movies of our time.  Like Good Will Hunting, the hero does not fit the mold precedented by Beowulf, or, in more modern vernacular, Star Wars.  Hunting doesn't go to college, or take the six figure salary, or clean up his act; he gets in his car, and leaves it all behind to go get the girl.  Granted, it is a crowd pleaser, but the scholarly likes of Sylvia Rousseve or Mike Mason would disagree with the depiction.  All the same, McDermott should (italic) cash in his chips, grab the girl, graduate, and head for the altar.  But, to the surprise of at least this viewer, he heads for Vegas in search of the World Series of Poker.  Looking back, one realizes `of course he does, that makes the most sense.'  But that is not the type of writing that Sister Mary Sunshine teaches in grade school, and unfortunately is often overlooked by public critics.  Writers, a tip keep it up.  Titanic gets boring, focus on the tragedies.  Will Hunting once said, `hey, whatever blows your hair back.'
