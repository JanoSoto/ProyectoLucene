She must find a lot of money, and deliver it to her boyfriend&#151;all within twenty minutes. Tom Tykwer has wound this film incredibly tight with his fast paced editing, dazzling special effects, and innovative use of film stock, thereby enhancing the narrative. This is evident in the way Tykwer approaches the look of the actual film on which the movie is shot. The color and quality of the film separate Lola and Manni apart from the other characters as well as scenes from the film.After the initial prologue which introduces the viewer to the game, we are thrust into the dynamic world in which Lola lives and the problem which she faces. Manni, her boyfriend had a responsibility to deliver some money, which he lost on the subway. This entire flashback sequence, reported to Lola by Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) via payphone, is brought to life with black and white flashback scenes that seem to have an extra edginess to them. These scenes play almost like a video, seeming to run at slightly faster than normal pace. It's as if Manni has played these scenes over and over again in his head, like the permanence of a bad accident or horrible event. The black and white symbolizes in viewer's mind the unchangeability of this event, which contrasts to the rest of the film that seems to have changeable outcomes. The rest of the movie launches from this base which serves as a solid checkpoint for the characters as well as the audience.Contrasting with the black and white is the recurrence of red throughout the film. There are two main scenes in which the characters are submersed in a red glow as they interrogate the other with deep philosophical questions. The red provides a contrast and a way of transitioning between attempts. Like the black and white of the beginning, the red signals to the audience that this scene isn't part of the game, but more of an intermission or pause. Special attention is paid to these two scenes because of their complete contrast to the rest of the film. They are slower, with more dialogs, and more thoughts to ponder.The final aspect of the film that separates Lola and Manni from the rest of the world is the quality and format in which the film was shot. Becoming especially apparent in the scene with Lola's father, Tykwer uses this technique extremely well to contrast between the world that Lola sees, and the world that she doesn't. Instead of wide or large shots, the scene between Lola's father and his mistress is an incredibly intimate one, and therefore shot on digital film using extreme zooms, setting it apart from the previous wide, sweeping shots of Lola as she's running. Because of this zoom on the digital camera, a slight graininess becomes evident which gives the audience a sense of displacement, as if perhaps, they shouldn't be watching this scene because it doesn't contain Lola or Manni. This is also noticeable in the scene containing the biker and bum. Again, the same technique was used to shoot this scene, and creates an uninvited effect for the audience.At first glance a viewer could deduce that Run Lola Run has very little in the way of narrative or character development and focuses much more on the use of special effects and film techniques. However, because of the careful consideration put into how the special effects are used, Tykwer has been able to create a connection between the two and has been able to impact how the audiences distinguishes Lola and Manni from the other characters in the film.

I was 10 years old and can remember sitting with my dad (another big aliens fan) and watching this film for the first time (on a old VHS taped from the telly).From the opening shocker of Ripley's dream to the pulse racing confrontation between the queen b***h and Ripley, I was glued to the screen. Even though i had not seen the original i immediately sympathised with Ripley and was amazed at how the new cast were extremely likable and important to the story. No line of dialogue is wasted in this film. This film is so quotable and have had a big influence on movies and other media (just check the original halo to hear multiple quotes ripped direct from this film).The film starts with Ripley the sole survivor of the nostromus space ship from the first film being awakened from hyperspace after 57 years. Soon she is sent back to the planet this time armed with high tech gadgets and an army of marines. This time though there are hundreds of aliens not just one. An important scene not in the theatrical cut gives the films second half more meaning and Ripley's motivation more sympathetic and understandable. I suggest if watching for the first time to get a copy of the directors cut, it adds so much more to an already brilliant film and even with an extended run time of 147 minutes you won't be bored.The casting for this film is perfect. Again Weaver gives a ground breaking performance unusual for a horror film. Cameron indulges her character development in this film as she befriends a young girl and their surrogate mother\/daughter storyline is beautifully done with very limited cheesiness. Ripley is also beefed up a bit in that she now comes equipped. What bloke (or woman) doesn't get excited at seeing Ripley in her vest top with a flame-thrower, pulse rifle and gun strap equipped and ready to face a terrifying nest of aliens. Carrie Henn who plays newt is also very good in her role and it a shame that she quit acting after this film. Paxton is awesome as Hutson and delivers some of the best one liners of the film. Michael Beihn is also very likable as Hicks. My favourite side character has to be the tough but likable private Vazquez brilliantly acted by Jeanette Goldstein. Special nods go to Burke and also Bishop, the former played brilliantly as the slimy corporate bigwig with a hidden agenda, whilst the latter plays his character with a creepy edge, making his motivations MD actions in the film non-predictable.I like the direction Cameron took with this sequel. Instead of trying to mimic alien with a new cast (which i heard is what fox wanted originally intended) he takes a completely different direction with more action but still presenting horrifying situations for the characters. Despite the heavy emphasis on action there are plenty of thrills and 'jump out of seat' moments in this sequel. Particular mention goes to the med lab scene when Ripley and newt find themselves locked in with facehuggers and when Ripley descends into the alien nest alone. Il stop talking now. If you haven't seen this film then what are you waiting for, and while your at it make sure you watch the others. Both alien and aliens get perfect scores from me and whilst the sequels don't quite reach the same heights you will want to continue to see how Ripley's story ends.so to some up, amazing story with surprising depth and heart for the genre it sits in,special effects that were out of this world for the time this film was made and a site knuckle ride from start to finish. An essential film that deserves the acclaim it gets. Plus sigouney was nominated for best actress at the Oscars for this, a rarity for sci-fi. I still watch this now and love it just the same as I did all those years ago.

After watching the expectable computer-generated climactic special effects, the thought came to me unbidden that no power on earth could get me to set foot on that contraption.I miss Carl Sagan a lot. He was a genuinely nice guy who had the grace and good sense not to drop into my comprehensive exams when they were in fact open to any member of the faculty. His enthusiasm for the objects of his study were catching, in the way the flu is catching. Billions and billions of moons and galaxies. I hope he's now at home somewhere among them.

Always been a Harrison Ford fan ever since he made the Kessel-run in 12 parsecs lol, could give or take Pfieffer but she is a good actor, no doubt, and quite hot for an older chick...anyway It's very Hitchcock-inspired, so if you like that sort of creepiness check it out...otherwise you're not missing anything TOO special...has a great feel to it if you know what i mean...probably not...im weird.Quick gripe before I go... Why is it that every Tom, Dick and Harry in the world becomes an expert in the film-making process when they comment on movies on this site? Got a newsflash for ya just because you WATCH lots of movies doesn't make you an expert in the craft that is MAKING them.So before you go on and on about how predictable a film is, how the screenwriter used poor exposition, how the director doesn't know a good movie from a hole in the ground, etc etc ad nauseum, perhaps YOU should list your own screen writing\/directing credits...don't have any? Then sh*t up about it. Learn how difficult it actually is to make a good film before you bash one you perceive to be poorly made.

This film is bad, crude and highly offensive in places. Needless to say I loved every second of it. In the Vain of American Pie and Road Trip Van Wilder is a genuinely amusing film, okay not in the same league as even Road Trip, but the film has its moments.The story&#133; and I use that term lightly&#133; revolves around the titular van Wilder, starting his 7th year at college, the coolest guy on campus and very soon without his rich fathers money to fund him. What will he do? How will he make his tuition fees? Will&#133; oh who cares, lets face it all you are interested in are the gags. And for the first hour of the film they come quick and fast. And lets just say you will never look at a cream cake in the same light again&#133; The film hits the predictable serious bit, followed by the predictable ending and the gags do run out quick by the end.However that said I can think of worse ways to pass an hour or two, and watch out for the now standard outtakes on the end credits, some of which are more amusing than the last half hour of the film put together.
