It charts the complex relationships between six main characters, Captain Dana Holmes and his beautiful wife Karen, Sergeant Milton Warden, Private Robert Prewitt, his girlfriend Alma, and Prewitt's closest friend, Private Angelo Maggio. There are a number of interconnected sub-plots. Perhaps the most important concerns Prewitt's relations with his commanding officer, Captain Holmes. Holmes is a boxing fanatic, who believes that his promotion prospects will be improved if he can put together a successful team to compete in the Army boxing championships. He has therefore had Prewitt, whom he knows to be a talented middleweight boxer, drafted into his unit. Prewitt, however, refuses to join the boxing team, having given up the sport after an accident in which a sparring partner was blinded, so Holmes attempts to force him to do so by beginning a campaign of persecution against him. In another sub-plot Karen, whose marriage to a hard-drinking, unfaithful husband has become no more than a sham, becomes embroiled in an adulterous affair with Sergeant Warden. (The scene on the beach between Deborah Kerr and Burt Lancaster was considered scandalously daring by the standards of the early fifties). The other plot lines concern Maggio's battles against authority, especially a brutal sergeant named Fatso Judson, and the growing romance between Prewitt and Alma. (Contrary to what some reviewers have stated, Alma is not a prostitute; she may have been one in James Jones's novel, but in the film she became a nightclub hostess to appease the Hays Office). In many ways the film gives a negative picture of military life, although less so than the original book. A strict system of discipline may be necessary to make the Army an effective fighting force, but it also has the unwanted side-effect of allowing bullies like Holmes and Judson to abuse their authority. Holmes attempts to force Prewitt to join the boxing squad by imposing a series of unjust punishments and onerous duties on him; most of the NCOs are happy to go along with him, and even those like Warden who disagree with Holmes's actions see no alternative but to comply. This was the Big Picture of 1953; it won eight Oscars, including Best Picture, against a very strong field which also included Roman Holiday, Julius Caesar and Shane, and Best Director for Fred Zinnemann. Five of the cast were nominated and two of them, Donna Reed (Alma) and Frank Sinatra (Maggio) won. This was the film that made Sinatra a big star as an actor as well as a singer. He plays Maggio as likable and easygoing, in contrast to his more intense friend Prewitt, but also a man with reserves of both moral and physical courage; he is not afraid to stand up to Judson, who is much larger than he is. (Ernest Borgnine is very good as the thuggish Judson). I must say that I agree with the Academy's decision to award Best Actress to Audrey Hepburn ahead of Kerr; Kerr is good here, but Audrey is absolutely brilliant in Roman Holiday, as she normally was. American audiences might have been surprised to see Kerr, normally one of the cinema's good girls, playing an adulterous wife, although British ones might have remembered her as the mercenary Sally in Love on the Dole. She does, however, make Karen a fairly sympathetic character; she is not, contrary to what the film critic of Variety thought, a nymphomaniac, even though it is made clear that Warden is not her first extra-marital lover. She is driven not by sexual lust but by a need for love that cannot be satisfied by her husband, who cruelly neglects and mistreats her. I have never seen Stalag 17, so cannot say if William Holden deserved Best Actor ahead of Montgomery Clift and Burt Lancaster (or, for that matter, Brando in Julius Caesar). Both, however, are excellent, especially that intelligent, sensitive actor Clift as Prewitt, a young man with firmly-held principles, who will not allow himself to be dissuaded from doing what he believes to be right. Despite his mistreatment by Holmes, he never considers leaving the Army, an institution which has previously treated him well and has become like a family to him. (The depiction of military life is not entirely negative; the Army may allow unpleasant sadists a chance to vent their spleen, but it also provides young men with a sense of belonging and self-respect). Lancaster's Warden is another man for whom the Army has become his whole life. Although he outwardly seems a strong character, he is inwardly weak. He is compromised by his affair with Karen (a crime under military law), and lacks the strength to stand up to Holmes. He loves the Army life but despises its officer class; when he gets the chance to become an officer himself he fails to take it, even though he knows that such a promotion offers him the best chance of a life together with Karen. Some Big Pictures from the past have not aged well, but From Here to Eternity is not among them. What makes it such an outstanding film is the strength of its acting and characterisation and the power of a good story well told. It is the sort of film they don't make any more, and the cinema is the poorer for it. One of the best films of the fifties. 9\/10.

It has a familiar place on most retail shelves, but isn't often mentioned. I myself had never heard anyone talk about it until someone recommended it to me roughly about a week ago. It's early Schumacher, coming out some time before he ruined the Batman franchise, and it seems like one of his little secrets, only there for those who find it word of mouth.Starting with a less surreal take-off of the opening scene of 8 1\/2, Falling Down follows a new day in the life of D-fens, a white collar man who decides in the middle of a traffic jam to play hookey, only to find himself suddenly seeing the decay around him with a little more clarity. At first he simply rants and raves and attempts to get a breath of fresh air, but as he continually finds himself under pressure (and habitually gains access to more and more weapons), his personal momentum builds into a violent and scathing criticism of everything that gets in his way--which covers many facets of society, luckily enough.Believe me, there's some catharsis to be felt from this one. Ever gone to McDonalds and just wanted a McMuffin, but arrived five minutes too late for the breakfast menu? Watch this movie, it'll help you feel better. Ever wanted to put both gangsters and rich country club yuppies in their place? Watch this movie, it'll make you feel fine. Ever wanted to believe you could turn your mundane life into going out in a blaze of glory? Well, if you relate enough to this guy, you might just be the type to snap, too.Michael Douglas' performance helps a lot. What could be a twisted and schlocky movie becomes endearingly personal and tragic with Douglas' mopey face. Robert Duvall plays a nice counterpoint as the policeman who, like D-fens, always played by the rules, but whose stress is eventually making him question the logic of following the system. And scattered throughout are some rather brilliant single moments of epiphany as D-fens rants about the minor things that make society so frustrating, from disgusting cheeseburgers to inflation to questioning the point of most construction.I will admit there's some ways in which I don't agree with this film, for instance his taking his rage out on some of the smaller workers who probably don't really care for their jobs in the first place. The retail employee in me cringes when I think of how over-used The Customer Is Always Right! and What About My Consumer Rights! are for means of bringing a stressed out, semi-paranoid, frustrated person into a public rant. D-fens constantly rails against the lack of caring and personalization in service as one of the many chips in society's glossy facade, but in a way its the very convenience he craves that has led to a major lack of interpersonal connection. My thing is, if you don't want the hamburger, then don't pay for it and don't eat it--but whatever you do, don't pull out a gun on minimum wage workers, they have crappy lives anyway.Nevertheless, this movie comes from a very strong place and has a lot to say about the various levels in which we've all fallen out of sync. For those looking for a somewhat more violent, massively darker Office Space, Falling Down is that movie to unwind with after having a very, very long day.

What could be a twisted and schlocky movie becomes endearingly personal and tragic with Douglas' mopey face. Robert Duvall plays a nice counterpoint as the policeman who, like D-fens, always played by the rules, but whose stress is eventually making him question the logic of following the system. And scattered throughout are some rather brilliant single moments of epiphany as D-fens rants about the minor things that make society so frustrating, from disgusting cheeseburgers to inflation to questioning the point of most construction.I will admit there's some ways in which I don't agree with this film, for instance his taking his rage out on some of the smaller workers who probably don't really care for their jobs in the first place. The retail employee in me cringes when I think of how over-used The Customer Is Always Right! and What About My Consumer Rights! are for means of bringing a stressed out, semi-paranoid, frustrated person into a public rant. D-fens constantly rails against the lack of caring and personalization in service as one of the many chips in society's glossy facade, but in a way its the very convenience he craves that has led to a major lack of interpersonal connection. My thing is, if you don't want the hamburger, then don't pay for it and don't eat it--but whatever you do, don't pull out a gun on minimum wage workers, they have crappy lives anyway.Nevertheless, this movie comes from a very strong place and has a lot to say about the various levels in which we've all fallen out of sync. For those looking for a somewhat more violent, massively darker Office Space, Falling Down is that movie to unwind with after having a very, very long day.

It has a familiar place on most retail shelves, but isn't often mentioned. I myself had never heard anyone talk about it until someone recommended it to me roughly about a week ago. It's early Schumacher, coming out some time before he ruined the Batman franchise, and it seems like one of his little secrets, only there for those who find it word of mouth.Starting with a less surreal take-off of the opening scene of 8 1\/2, Falling Down follows a new day in the life of D-fens, a white collar man who decides in the middle of a traffic jam to play hookey, only to find himself suddenly seeing the decay around him with a little more clarity. At first he simply rants and raves and attempts to get a breath of fresh air, but as he continually finds himself under pressure (and habitually gains access to more and more weapons), his personal momentum builds into a violent and scathing criticism of everything that gets in his way--which covers many facets of society, luckily enough.Believe me, there's some catharsis to be felt from this one. Ever gone to McDonalds and just wanted a McMuffin, but arrived five minutes too late for the breakfast menu? Watch this movie, it'll help you feel better. Ever wanted to put both gangsters and rich country club yuppies in their place? Watch this movie, it'll make you feel fine.

It's not helped by a particularly vicious and selfish lead character, played by Thora Birch, but it IS helped by finding its heart and soul about three-quarters of the way in. How much this movie appeals to you will depend on how well you identify with Birch's Enid, an iconoclast who delights in her displeasure with just about everything and everybody. But it's how her character relates to Buscemi's schlubby Seymour, with a relationship that evolves from cruel to curious to tender, that might well sell you on the entire premise.Enid and Becky (Birch and Johannson) are recent high school grads who don't quite buy in to the optimistic and\/or clueless nature of their fellow classmates. They're sort of like Goths without the monochrome wardrobe. The girls are the sort who like to hassle fellow classmates - including their friend Josh (the late Brad Renfro), who works at a local convenience store - just for kicks. They're like the Mean Girls without the awesome hair. At any rate, they're looking for trouble one day when they decide to answer a personals ad just to mess with the sender. They set up a blind date; snickering behind their hands, they watch Seymour get stood up by the date that would never arrive.But that's only the beginning of things, as the trio find themselves drawn together, improbably. Enid, a perpetual loner, is intrigued by the self-described dorky Seymour, who's content with his old-time interests (including a vast 78-rpm record collection) and has basically given up on a life outside of his apartment and job. Becky, on the other hand, is a bit skeptical of the budding relationship between her best friend and Seymour, who's certainly much older than either of them.Although this may seem like a study of what happens to two conniving girls after they pull a prank on someone who's totally not cool, it's really the story of the evolution of Enid's character - in fact, Enid is really the main character here, with Seymour and Becky playing lesser roles (contrary to the movie's poster). The complexities of her relationship to her former mark are explored rather well; there's a physical attraction, perhaps, but more importantly Enid sees in Seymour a way for her to redeem herself. After all, if she can help him improve his life, then the stain of her mean-spirited prank will be steam-cleaned away.The acting is pretty good, but Buscemi, in an understated, nuanced performance, steals the show. Seymour is hopeless but not without hope; he's pathetic, stuck in a world that passed him by thirty years or so ago. His social skills are nearly nonexistent, and he spends his free time interacting with record aficionados, so he and Enid make quite the mismatched pair.Again, though, if you don't buy into the character of Enid from the get-go - if, that is, you don't see anything redeemable in her to begin with - then the movie won't be the cult classic it should be. Juno, which came out seven years later, had a titular character who was just as snarky and all knowing but without the bitter, pathetic, hate-filled edge that Enid has here. Birch does what she can, and she can carry the picture when Buscemi's not on screen, but the mountain's too steep for her to climb.*** ","genre":null},{"date":"14 August 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" In retrospect, seven years after its initial release, Ghost World rings a little hollow, sort of like costar Scarlett Johannson's character later, in Lost in Translation, and Steve Buscemi's character Seymour here.

He is the kind of cop that everyone wish for the better security of a society but at the same time he is the kind of cop that is very unique, that is not only a menace for the criminals but also for the majority of the cops, well actually and technically those are criminals too. This film is about that man, a man that wasn't the common cop and that's because he was what a cop should be. He has a dream and he has everything that he needs for that dream yet he was going to live the reality. He never woke up from his dream and considering everything that was a real valuable thing and very very unusual. This is the evolution of man, the weird cop who was not weird because his unusual appearance for a cop but because he never accepted bribes, he was very suspicious because of that. This is a successful film, it shares the frustration and the rest of the similar feelings of Serpico and obviously when Serpico can do what he wants it is fair and absolutely satisfactory. There is a scene that I found extremely powerful, when Serpico arrest a criminal by his own, a criminal who is for Serpico's partners good people. Suddenly Serpico becomes what at first he wasn't, you know he is not more kind with criminals. Is unique because in the first confrontation between Serpico and some criminals he is the one arresting one of them yet are others the ones that have some fun with the criminal. Now is a different situation, now Serpico is alone and his motives are not because of the criminal, his motives are because of the cops, his own partners, and his frustration, his anger of being witness of why cops believes that a criminal is good people, of course because those are the same scum. All of this obviously relies on the ones near Serpico. His girlfriend simply represents all the personal life of Serpico and how his work changed everything. She has a wonderful dialog or better a wonderful little story to tell, of course the story of the king. She understood him, that's why she left him I think. But there was a little hope and at a point you feel thankful with two characters, I don't really remember their names but I think you remember them very well. But everything just is realistic so a simple song can't change something.As the producer featured on the extra material of the DVD says, Al Pacino is still there but definitely he is not more Al Pacino. Is not a complaint, he has given everything, like De Niro or even like Carlos Santana. After my favourite picture of all time, The Godfather (Francis Ford Coppola, 1972), he had in 1973 a fantastic professional year with this superb performance together with the one in Scarecrow in which he made a great team with Gene Hackman. Here everything relies on Pacino but everyone else did also a great acting job. Finally, Serpico is a very recommended picture, actually and sort of sadly is only the second film of Sidney Lumet that I watch (being the other Dog Day Afternoon). This is not a film that I would like to watch very often but still is a great one. I think the next step for me is to re- watch the overlooked near masterpiece Scarecrow. DVD We have Sidney Lumet and a producer telling us their memories about the beginning of this project, about the filming, about Frank Serpico, their favourites scenes, etc. Every minute of this material is quite interesting. It includes some anecdotes with Frank Serpico (for example Frank wanted to be practically stick to Pacino during the entire filming, obviously a very uncomfortable situation that of course was impossible) but I think the most curious is when Sidney Lumet talks about the score of the picture that is featured with the photo gallery; You will feel good for Lumet. The other extra is the theatrical trailer, then a great DVD. ","genre":null},{"date":"14 August 2008","score":"","review":" The story of Serpico should be absurd and you know why.

Now is a different situation, now Serpico is alone and his motives are not because of the criminal, his motives are because of the cops, his own partners, and his frustration, his anger of being witness of why cops believes that a criminal is good people, of course because those are the same scum. All of this obviously relies on the ones near Serpico. His girlfriend simply represents all the personal life of Serpico and how his work changed everything. She has a wonderful dialog or better a wonderful little story to tell, of course the story of the king. She understood him, that's why she left him I think. But there was a little hope and at a point you feel thankful with two characters, I don't really remember their names but I think you remember them very well. But everything just is realistic so a simple song can't change something.As the producer featured on the extra material of the DVD says, Al Pacino is still there but definitely he is not more Al Pacino. Is not a complaint, he has given everything, like De Niro or even like Carlos Santana. After my favourite picture of all time, The Godfather (Francis Ford Coppola, 1972), he had in 1973 a fantastic professional year with this superb performance together with the one in Scarecrow in which he made a great team with Gene Hackman. Here everything relies on Pacino but everyone else did also a great acting job. Finally, Serpico is a very recommended picture, actually and sort of sadly is only the second film of Sidney Lumet that I watch (being the other Dog Day Afternoon). This is not a film that I would like to watch very often but still is a great one. I think the next step for me is to re- watch the overlooked near masterpiece Scarecrow. DVD We have Sidney Lumet and a producer telling us their memories about the beginning of this project, about the filming, about Frank Serpico, their favourites scenes, etc. Every minute of this material is quite interesting. It includes some anecdotes with Frank Serpico (for example Frank wanted to be practically stick to Pacino during the entire filming, obviously a very uncomfortable situation that of course was impossible) but I think the most curious is when Sidney Lumet talks about the score of the picture that is featured with the photo gallery; You will feel good for Lumet. The other extra is the theatrical trailer, then a great DVD. ","genre":"Biography, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"14 August 2008","score":"","review":" The story of Serpico should be absurd and you know why. He is the kind of cop that everyone wish for the better security of a society but at the same time he is the kind of cop that is very unique, that is not only a menace for the criminals but also for the majority of the cops, well actually and technically those are criminals too. This film is about that man, a man that wasn't the common cop and that's because he was what a cop should be. He has a dream and he has everything that he needs for that dream yet he was going to live the reality. He never woke up from his dream and considering everything that was a real valuable thing and very very unusual. This is the evolution of man, the weird cop who was not weird because his unusual appearance for a cop but because he never accepted bribes, he was very suspicious because of that. This is a successful film, it shares the frustration and the rest of the similar feelings of Serpico and obviously when Serpico can do what he wants it is fair and absolutely satisfactory. There is a scene that I found extremely powerful, when Serpico arrest a criminal by his own, a criminal who is for Serpico's partners good people. Suddenly Serpico becomes what at first he wasn't, you know he is not more kind with criminals. Is unique because in the first confrontation between Serpico and some criminals he is the one arresting one of them yet are others the ones that have some fun with the criminal.

The concert scene here is the absolute best part here, taking up a rather significant portion of time to a fun concept, as there is specific songs that go through and once the vampires get involved up on-stage, it turns into a great action scene where, using the surroundings and wire-fu, manages to defeat the in front of the crowd who feels that they're merely putting on an act. Once the fire reigns down, it just cements the fun. The bar sequence, immediately after the resurrection is also really good since the fire gag makes it incredibly entertaining and just fun, as is the initial resurrection sequence.

And at that, it's not entirely straight, but it seldom edges into Lynch's private vision, or through the looking glass, or down the rabbit hole, or into The Garden of Earthly Delights or the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir, or wherever it is that his other films, beginning with Eraserhead, have voyaged into.I should note that all of David Lynch's movies are eerie and ominous, but that the atmosphere isn't created by directorial fireworks. The techniques are classical -- no instant cutting, no slow motion, no ghoulish colors, no funny camera work, although the lens may occasionally plumb the auditory canal of a severed ear. Instead, what makes his work exception is his control of the images and sound. The art direction, set decoration, the architecture and textures, and the sound are as filled with impact as the story itself. It's a sentimental and ultimately tragic story naturally. John Merrick, the elephant man of the title, was a rude lump of foul deformity, a simulacrum of a human being. What else could they do, turn it into a comedy? A werewolf movie? John Hurt is Merrick, kept in thrall by Bytes (Freddie Jones) who exhibits him to the public in a freak show in Victorian London. Merrick is rescued by Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) who sneaks him into a hospital run by Carr Gomm (John Gielgud) where he is tended by nurses who are frightened of him. All the nurses except their chief, Mothershead. Mothershead is enacted by a starchy Wendy Hiller.Here's how a director with a case of arrested aesthetic development and a craving for commercial success would have first revealed the hideous half-human that was John Merrick. Generic suspense music, please. A frightened nurse open Merrick's door, she drops the plates and shrieks while the camera zooms into her terrified face. Then -- a cut, and the camera whips up to Merrick's deformed face, accompanied by a loud, dissonant sting on the sound track -- WHAMMMMM! Not here though.Gradually the staff come to realize that despite his disfigurement, Merrick is really a sweet and gentle soul, forgiving and grateful for the smallest of kindnesses. Warmth replaces fear. And when Treves takes Merrick home to meet his wife (Hannah Gordon), this caprice of nature begins to sob quietly, saying, I've never been treated so well by a lovely woman. Imagine how much worse it could have been. Instead of being barely able to hiss his lines -- instead of producing mediocre sketches -- instead of merely building a model cathedral out of match sticks -- the script could have turned him into a genius! How inspiring? Elephant Man rescued from freak show writes a smash hit Broadway play? Paints the Mona Lisa of 1890? Mentally extends pi to 23 digits in ten seconds? Invents Leggos? No. The only thing Merrick has going for him is his utter joy at being treated humanely. Thank God he's just a nice guy, not a saint.The rest of the principles are frankly splendid. Models of acting, really, with not a sour note being struck. Especially interesting is Hannah Gordon's portrayal of Treve's wife. She's not a dazzling beauty but has one of the most expressive faces on screen. She tells us everything we need to know by just lifting an eyebrow. (What Freddy Jones could have learned from her!) Hannah Gordon doesn't have that much screen time here but catch her, if you can, in Miss Morrison's Ghosts, in which she plays opposite Wendy Hiller, to see a true professional at her best.The director, David Lynch, keeps his act together in this relatively straightforward story but it wouldn't have been made quite this oddly by anyone else. I mean, the film opens with a scene of Merrick's mother being run down and trampled by a herd of screaming, stampeding elephants. What the hell does that have to do with the movie? It's never mentioned in the script. It's certainly not Merrick's fantasy. And there's no reason to believe that his mother really WAS frightened by elephants.Although Lynch doesn't use many tricky codes in the movie, he rarely passes up a chance to show us the grimy perineum of Victorian London -- the basement fires being stoked, the black smoke billowing from the chimney, the intricate reticula of a lace curtain stirring in the open window, the slick wet bricks of an industrializing city gone berserk, the iron webbing across Victoria Station's glass roof. Texture piled on texture, and all of it somehow ominous. He does for man's indifferent artifacts what Peter Weir and Nicholas Roeg did for Australia's natural features. He's invested them with dread.It occurred to me while watching this that Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window is usually described as drawing the audience into Jimmy Stewart's voyeurism and thus making us as guilty as he is, of snooping into others' lives. What does The Elephant Man do to ITS audience then? Turn us into gawkers at a carnival freak show? I wonder how many of us went to see this movie when it was released, not so much to watch an enjoyable and well-done film, but to see what all the fuss was about? Lynch takes it easy on the audience in that regard. Merrick is horrifyingly deformed but there are no cheap shocks. Lynch gives us his appearance little by little until, by the time we see him in his awesome ugliness, we've gotten to know him a bit and to empathize with him. And why shouldn't we admire and respect him? We may look better than Merrick, but he'd be hard for any of us to beat in a contest of soul against soul.

John Merrick, the elephant man of the title, was a rude lump of foul deformity, a simulacrum of a human being. What else could they do, turn it into a comedy? A werewolf movie? John Hurt is Merrick, kept in thrall by Bytes (Freddie Jones) who exhibits him to the public in a freak show in Victorian London. Merrick is rescued by Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) who sneaks him into a hospital run by Carr Gomm (John Gielgud) where he is tended by nurses who are frightened of him. All the nurses except their chief, Mothershead. Mothershead is enacted by a starchy Wendy Hiller.Here's how a director with a case of arrested aesthetic development and a craving for commercial success would have first revealed the hideous half-human that was John Merrick. Generic suspense music, please. A frightened nurse open Merrick's door, she drops the plates and shrieks while the camera zooms into her terrified face. Then -- a cut, and the camera whips up to Merrick's deformed face, accompanied by a loud, dissonant sting on the sound track -- WHAMMMMM! Not here though.Gradually the staff come to realize that despite his disfigurement, Merrick is really a sweet and gentle soul, forgiving and grateful for the smallest of kindnesses. Warmth replaces fear. And when Treves takes Merrick home to meet his wife (Hannah Gordon), this caprice of nature begins to sob quietly, saying, I've never been treated so well by a lovely woman. Imagine how much worse it could have been. Instead of being barely able to hiss his lines -- instead of producing mediocre sketches -- instead of merely building a model cathedral out of match sticks -- the script could have turned him into a genius! How inspiring? Elephant Man rescued from freak show writes a smash hit Broadway play? Paints the Mona Lisa of 1890? Mentally extends pi to 23 digits in ten seconds? Invents Leggos? No. The only thing Merrick has going for him is his utter joy at being treated humanely. Thank God he's just a nice guy, not a saint.The rest of the principles are frankly splendid. Models of acting, really, with not a sour note being struck. Especially interesting is Hannah Gordon's portrayal of Treve's wife. She's not a dazzling beauty but has one of the most expressive faces on screen. She tells us everything we need to know by just lifting an eyebrow. (What Freddy Jones could have learned from her!) Hannah Gordon doesn't have that much screen time here but catch her, if you can, in Miss Morrison's Ghosts, in which she plays opposite Wendy Hiller, to see a true professional at her best.The director, David Lynch, keeps his act together in this relatively straightforward story but it wouldn't have been made quite this oddly by anyone else. I mean, the film opens with a scene of Merrick's mother being run down and trampled by a herd of screaming, stampeding elephants. What the hell does that have to do with the movie? It's never mentioned in the script. It's certainly not Merrick's fantasy. And there's no reason to believe that his mother really WAS frightened by elephants.Although Lynch doesn't use many tricky codes in the movie, he rarely passes up a chance to show us the grimy perineum of Victorian London -- the basement fires being stoked, the black smoke billowing from the chimney, the intricate reticula of a lace curtain stirring in the open window, the slick wet bricks of an industrializing city gone berserk, the iron webbing across Victoria Station's glass roof. Texture piled on texture, and all of it somehow ominous. He does for man's indifferent artifacts what Peter Weir and Nicholas Roeg did for Australia's natural features. He's invested them with dread.It occurred to me while watching this that Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window is usually described as drawing the audience into Jimmy Stewart's voyeurism and thus making us as guilty as he is, of snooping into others' lives. What does The Elephant Man do to ITS audience then? Turn us into gawkers at a carnival freak show? I wonder how many of us went to see this movie when it was released, not so much to watch an enjoyable and well-done film, but to see what all the fuss was about? Lynch takes it easy on the audience in that regard. Merrick is horrifyingly deformed but there are no cheap shocks. Lynch gives us his appearance little by little until, by the time we see him in his awesome ugliness, we've gotten to know him a bit and to empathize with him. And why shouldn't we admire and respect him? We may look better than Merrick, but he'd be hard for any of us to beat in a contest of soul against soul.

It begins with a very hot day, and I was just watching it at one hot summer. Its atmosphere is so light, like a real weekend yet for only an hour and a half.There is something innocent, charming, and so nostalgic about the 1980s. I don't know exactly, but definitely it was aesthetically nicer and calmer. It's my nature to love that polished painting with all its sweet tinges out of those day's movies. God, what's about the 1980s to adore it like that? Hmm.. I'll look to the enjoyable little movie to understand..There is intensive sense of beauty all over it, like the bright colors of the sets or the swim suits, and the bodies in the swim suits as well !, so the sightly villa (great presence for the sea in the background most of the time). Look at the apartment of the 1960s' décor too, it got some snug decision. Even (Catherine Mary Stewart) herself, she was representing perfectly the 1980s' beauty as tender and too cute, (just like 'Cynthia Gibb' from the same era) you can say that again about her shape, haircut, and of course clothes, I'm a crazy person when it comes to the 1980s' vivid modes, so how about seeing her into that dazzling swim suit, I think.. It's only in the 1980s ! Plus, there was no dirty jokes, bad tasting, and no nastiness. Truly this movie looks genius to make a pure laughable time through what's supposed to be dark element, and without the usual tons of filthiness of our very own age where whenever you're about to watch a comedy you must think abusive ! The script handled it well as for a 90 min movie. It was good and plain. They consumed all the possible situations yet without extension or any huge ambitions demand huger budget. One of the best ideas was that desperate killer whom kills the same target again and again to watch him alive and kicking afterwards every time. However there was some kind of straying before the climax, as we were watching a chase of unseen killer ! In a long sequence without even music?, moreover knowing everything through the recorded phone call, that was easy to a cheesy extent !, and finally I didn't quite like (or catch on) the successful sex with the dead man ?! (Jonathan Silverman) and (Andrew McCarthy) made a fine job, but they weren't that charismatic, nor that creatively comedians. (Terry Kiser) was maybe half of the show as Mr. scene stealer all along. He totally mastered it as a dead-man in-a-comedy, only to compete with (Vincent Gardenia) in the great comedy (Fire Sale - 1977). I think (Kiser) here was something all the method acting's schools must watch and learn. I loved, the most, the last scene, it was hilarious and epitomized the whole thing gracefully.Maybe one of the movie's secrets is that great chance which it gives you to live the ultimate revenge on your boss (the one who conspired to have you killed !).In one week, I watched (Superman 3 - 1983), (Police Academy 6 - 1989), (Short Circuit 2 - 1988), then (Weekend at Bernie's - 1989). It is heaven already for one of the eighties lovers. And if you're not, just watch (Weekend..) in a summer day with your fan turned on, and believe me, you'll feel the sea breath coming out of the screen to cool you off.The worst thing about it is that after finishing it I would come back to my usual life which's close to Bernie's one..

I also remember the critics ripping this movie to shreds, so I decided it would be appropriate for me to find out for myself. I was astonished at how great the Beach is, but I'm definitely not surprised at the discrepancy of opinions from person to person. This movie is not for everyone; it takes a certain type of mindset to get into the movie. For any ambitious person working hard to achieve the American dream this movie can come off as nonsensical, confusing, unrealistic, and meaningless. But any person with ambition for life, and exotic, unpredictable raw passion and pleasure this movie can serve chills and strike that person close to the roots. This movie is certainly made to enhance the viewers pleasure if under the influence of marijuana, but it is much more than a stoner movie. The Beach is an examination of the pull people feel from their more primitive side. As technology is vastly increasing and becoming more complex; people in the real world have a tendency to become submerged in the drive to succeed. The beach is the ultimate paradise, and one critique of the movie is that ultimately the paradise doesn't work in the end, I only wish somehow it could. This movie isn't perfect by any stretch, but overall as a movie I give it a B- grade. However, there are a few scenes in this movie that are as powerful as I've ever seen in cinema. The scene when the three newbies first see the beach, for example, is a very awesome sight. Another obvious strong scene is the night swimming sex scene. This scene was not only aesthetically incredible, but absolutely ripe with passion; so much that the viewer can almost feel the haze of infatuation.Overall the acting is both good and bad. Leo does a great job, which is to be expected from him, but some of the other actors fall short in a few scenes. A few parts of the movie are also rather corny, when Richard pretends to be in a video game, for example. The soundtrack literally could not be better, it's incredible.

Turned by the vampire Lestat de Lioncourt, (Tom Cruise) in 1794 Louisiana, he soon becomes one although he still has a respect for life that makes him reluctant to kill. The more time they spend together, the more he tries to overcome the affliction, and with the help of young Claudia, (Kirsten Dunst) it does help him get over the case. Realizing that there's nothing left in America, they leave for Paris and run into Armand, (Antonio Banderas) another vampire who teaches them the tricks of the trade. When their presence inspires a riot amongst the other vampires in the commune, they realize the need to escape and go back to America in order to be safe.The Good News This was a nicely pleasant surprise and was a lot better than expected. One of the better examples of this is the film's ability to contain a lot of really nice action scenes. There's the fiery destruction of the mansion, as the more flames spread across the estate the more the realization dawns that there's little escape, and it has a really rousing finale that is really nice and works perfectly. The opera stage show shown is really fun as well, throwing in a bunch of stuff that is creepy and yet operatic at the same time, and the nudity thrown in is really great. Some of the other scenes, including the fire in the bedroom where one of them is set on fire with a huge flame to the night-time hunting in the Louisiana town and the finale to the Paris part of the film is a huge, epic fight that is really great and is one of the film's highlights. The torture method is intense and actually painful, the revenge is fantastic and actually worthwhile and there's also the fact that it's got the majority of the film's big list of kills. That's mainly due to the way the revenge is carried out, but there's plenty to like from this. There's a huge assortments of bites to the neck and arms, a couple are violently set on fire, another has the top half of the body sliced off with a scythe, a couple more are sliced up with a scythe, a couple are burnt to a crisp and turned into dust, couple have their neck broken and there's a really wicked slit throat that gushes a ton all over, and that there's a huge assortment of kills with it's big body count is really worthwhile and makes the other moments all the better. The last one here is the fact that the film has so many good parts that it never manages to get boring or dull. This one has a really nice pace to it that really helps it out and makes for really good viewing. These here are the film's good points.The Bad News There really isn't much wrong with this one, but there's a pretty big flaw to it. This is the film's manner of portraying its vampires as incredibly whinny and constantly complaining about everything that happens. The reluctance to do anything that usual vampires engage in, from the neck-biting to the supernatural powers are touched over here and there and the same conclusion about the vampires being in that behavior-set is always brought up. That is hardly any way to be able to treat it's vampires, since they're supposed to be very creepy and frightening, yet not so much in here. It takes a lot out of the film since that's mostly how the beginning of the film plays out for the majority of the time in those sections, and it rarely comes up from that. Another small flaw here is that the kills are all done in the same way, and hardly anything else is used in here. It really could've used some variety in here, and it's not detrimental but otherwise, these here are the film's flaws.The Final Verdict With some really fun moments to be had and only one really big flaw which holds it down a lot more than expected, but is still really good. Give this one a chance if you're into the moodier vampires, a fan of the creative side or those who prefer classy horror films, otherwise heed caution with the flaw.Rated R Graphic Violence and Full Nudity ","genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"14 August 2008","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Violent movie, that's it and please nothing more !

Everything seems to be at that level though the situation and plot are rather light. What is important here is that Hitchcock transforms this back yard and garden surrounded by buildings all around and a highly voyeuristic microcosm into a complete vision of human society with all its dramas, and its pleasures and joys. To transform such a small microcosm entirely closed onto itself into a vision of the whole society we hardly get a couple of glimpses of through an alley opening onto the main street is marvelous and amazing. The second phenomenal fact is that the main actor is a wheelchair-ridden man with a severely broken leg in a cast. How can the whole world completely turn and whirl around that sole man? It is only possible because it is absolutely seen through the only eyes of this man or the eyes of the people standing next to him. There is only one instance when the point of vision is not his own eyes but a point outside in the yard-garden at the end when he is being dropped from his window and then we get for a very short period of time the vision from the cops' eyes. This gives to that film such a personal dimension that it is nearly sickening we have the impression of invading the privacy of that man. In fact what I have just said is false because he alternates what the man can see and close-up shots on him to show his personal reactions to what he has just seen. This constant alternating of voyeuristic sequences from the eyes of one man and close-up shots on his body language and language forces us into his own skin, body, bones. We are no longer voyeurs but ghosts in him seeing through his eyes. We are the direct witnesses of what he sees because we see it with him, through his own eyes and we start feeling the same emotions as he does. Of course everything is seen through the camera, but Hitchcock even uses some tools to emphasize the voyeuristic dimension and force us into it a camera with a zooming lens that is so big that the camera becomes minuscule, or binoculars that are of course too big for the distance across the back yard and later the flash bulbs to force us not to see through the eyes of the murderer but to be seen through the eyes of the murderer. The last point I would like to insist on is that Hitchcock shows a murder but he is not interested in the murder per se but in the reactions of the witnesses, those who see everything and how they are blind to what they see. Then he builds up the slow recognition in their eyes, language and behavior, and then they become obsessive about it, to the point of becoming if not courageous at least unconscious of the risks they are taking or running. That too is remarkable and that nearly makes us get out of the simplistic voyeurism I have spoken of all along and climb into some kind of distantiation from the penned up impression of before, a distantiation that leads us to the idea that courage in a human society is often the result of a conviction that makes us blind to the danger or risk we are facing. Courage is the result of a lack of consciousness more than intensified consciousness. This is the human dimension Hitchcock always brought to his films. And that is kind of lost in our modern action films that do not have one single second now and then to just rest and digest what has happened before.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines ","genre":null},{"date":"14 August 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This film has become a cult film with time.

In fact what I have just said is false because he alternates what the man can see and close-up shots on him to show his personal reactions to what he has just seen. This constant alternating of voyeuristic sequences from the eyes of one man and close-up shots on his body language and language forces us into his own skin, body, bones. We are no longer voyeurs but ghosts in him seeing through his eyes. We are the direct witnesses of what he sees because we see it with him, through his own eyes and we start feeling the same emotions as he does. Of course everything is seen through the camera, but Hitchcock even uses some tools to emphasize the voyeuristic dimension and force us into it a camera with a zooming lens that is so big that the camera becomes minuscule, or binoculars that are of course too big for the distance across the back yard and later the flash bulbs to force us not to see through the eyes of the murderer but to be seen through the eyes of the murderer. The last point I would like to insist on is that Hitchcock shows a murder but he is not interested in the murder per se but in the reactions of the witnesses, those who see everything and how they are blind to what they see. Then he builds up the slow recognition in their eyes, language and behavior, and then they become obsessive about it, to the point of becoming if not courageous at least unconscious of the risks they are taking or running. That too is remarkable and that nearly makes us get out of the simplistic voyeurism I have spoken of all along and climb into some kind of distantiation from the penned up impression of before, a distantiation that leads us to the idea that courage in a human society is often the result of a conviction that makes us blind to the danger or risk we are facing. Courage is the result of a lack of consciousness more than intensified consciousness. This is the human dimension Hitchcock always brought to his films. And that is kind of lost in our modern action films that do not have one single second now and then to just rest and digest what has happened before.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines ","genre":"Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"14 August 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This film has become a cult film with time. Everything seems to be at that level though the situation and plot are rather light. What is important here is that Hitchcock transforms this back yard and garden surrounded by buildings all around and a highly voyeuristic microcosm into a complete vision of human society with all its dramas, and its pleasures and joys. To transform such a small microcosm entirely closed onto itself into a vision of the whole society we hardly get a couple of glimpses of through an alley opening onto the main street is marvelous and amazing. The second phenomenal fact is that the main actor is a wheelchair-ridden man with a severely broken leg in a cast. How can the whole world completely turn and whirl around that sole man? It is only possible because it is absolutely seen through the only eyes of this man or the eyes of the people standing next to him. There is only one instance when the point of vision is not his own eyes but a point outside in the yard-garden at the end when he is being dropped from his window and then we get for a very short period of time the vision from the cops' eyes.

James Cromwell is the most chilled out villain you'll ever going to see in a film like this and has been criminally ignored by the Academy. Curtis Hanson was also someone who had made some good films but no masterpieces till this came along. They all must have sold their souls to make this because when you get big cast get together to make a Hollywood film then you become a bit intrigued by it because if the cast is big then is the story any good?

Next, it has much more creepy scenes than any horror I've seen (I've counted like 20+), especially the bathroom scenes and the scene with Brenda hearing the voice. But what really makes this movie scary, are the scenes where's there's no killing! Here's some the creepy scenes that actually creep me out - In the beginning where Ms. Voorhees walks into the cabin - The part where they're swimming and you see the hand of the killer touching the tree, then someone hears something and they go to a shot of the forest with nothing moving.... - The lights going out at camp - Steve getting killed - Jack getting killed - The bathroom scenes - the scene where Brenda's in the bathroom and she leaves, then it shows the light shaking...
