Puff Daddy should have gone straight to acting in the first place and saved himself the embarrassment of his rap career. He does a wonderful job in this wonderful movie portraying a death row inmate named Tyrell Musgrove, the husband of Leticia, played by Halle Berry. The film starts off dealing with the relationship between Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) and his son Sonny (Heath Ledger) and Sonny's learning the ropes of becoming a prison guard like his dear old dad. Tyrell is a complicated character because we automatically sympathize with the enormity of his situation, trying to explain to his son in front of a prison guard why he's not going to be around anymore, but at the same time he accepts his fate because he has brought it upon himself. It is significant that this is a man who has committed a crime and doesn't fight against the system when the punishment is imposed, because he deserves it. In one of the most potent lines in the entire film, he tells his son, `I'm a bad man, you're the best of me.'Hank is also a very complicated character. This is an enormously racist man who chases a couple of young black kids off his property by shooting a shotgun into the air, even when the kids only came over to play with his son. He knew that they meant no harm, and he still fired into the air to scare him away. This is the movie's protagonist, and there is soon a scene with the father of those two boys where you want nothing more than to see Hank get dragged out of his car and smacked around for a little while. But the movie amazingly develops his character enough so that we are able to look deeper into who exactly he is and what kind of past he has had, and to forgive him for who he is and accept him as the protagonist.(spoilers) Several of the characters are portrayed in this way, with very conflicting characteristics that challenge you to develop a straightforward opinion of any of them (except for Hank's father, who is such a heavily racist redneck that there is no question from the very beginning that he's going to be nothing but trouble). The movie reminds us that the mark of an intelligent mind is the ability to hold conflicting opinions of the same thing and still be able to function, and we are able to do this because we get to know Hank so much better. His racism is a result of the way his father raised him, and even the way he handled (and, indeed, caused) the death of his son can be seen as having been caused by having been raised by a man who has implanted the idea that those who cannot be racist are `weak.'Halle Berry gives a powerful role as Leticia, whose life is spinning completely out of control. Her husband has been executed (which is a huge shock to her even though she is obviously so emotionally detached from him), she has lost her job, her landlord is evicting her by force of the law, and her son is hopelessly overweight. The majority of the narrative story comes from the interaction between Hank and Leticia, who are both going against their morals and beliefs, to a varied extent, in associating with each other, and each of their eventual realizations of who the other person is.It is significant that Hank learns that Leticia is the widow of the man he had recently put to death (and who's death indirectly lead to his own son's suicide) and that he reacts by trying to keep her from finding out that he had helped kill her husband. Their interaction with each other provides the redemption of each of their sins up to that point, especially his. He has overcome his racism to genuinely care about this woman, and he wants to hide who he is from her for her own protection and also because he is afraid to lose her. The movie reminds me a little bit of those old Babar books. You know, the ones with the big talking elephant from the jungle. In Babar books, characters actually die. This is a rarity in children's literature. Babar's own mother was shot by a poacher, but you always turn the page and move on with the story, which is a great metaphor for life. In Monster's Ball, there are plenty of tragic events, and the execution of Tyrell and Leticia getting fired and evicted are not even the worst of them. But as is evident in the closing scene in the film (which I didn't like at all until I stopped to think about it), she is moving on from her troubles, albeit with an unlikely companion, but at least one who seems more than willing to move on with her. He has defected from his racist past by putting his verbally abusive father into a retirement home, and has turned all of his efforts to Leticia in hopes of finding a better life with her. The movie ends rather suddenly, but it ends with the promise of better times to come.

It's no spoiler to tell you that every actor you don't recognize is there for the express purpose of being eaten by a snake.

If you're in the market for a humdinger of a creature feature that will scare you out of your pants, this is your film.Like so many urban legends, alligators in the NY City sewer system for instance, the legend of giant anacondas in Amazonia have persisted for years.  The biggest whopper I heard was of a snake 150 feet long, with eyes the size of pie plates, discovered by a crew that crash-landed a B-29 during WWII.  Apparently, the snake devoured the B-29, because its remains have yet to be found.This film plays to those legends and our instinctive fear and fascination with snakes.  Psychologists of the Jungian persuasion will have a field day with this.The plot is simple  a group of scientists, led by Dr. Steven Cale (Eric Stolz) travel deep into the Amazon in search of that Long Lost Tribe of natives who seem only to inhabit the back lots of Hollywood.  It's no spoiler to tell you that every actor you don't recognize is there for the express purpose of being eaten by a snake.  Along the way they pick up Paul Sarone (John Voigt), a blonde, blue-eyed Aryan ubermensch with a Spanish name and accent (where, oh where, did he get that blonde hair and blue eyes? Hee hee hee - think it over!) who comes aboard with a 50 foot snakeskin that he quickly unrolls to demonstrate where his heart lies.  Voigt, a truly wonderful actor, is superb in this roll, playing it over the top with a smile on his face and a gleam in his eye, chewing the scenery, the raft, and finally his fellow actors.Sarone contrives to send Dr. Cale into a coma, takes over the raft, and soon we are hot on the trail, or tail, of snakes, one longer and with wider girth than the next.  If you're familiar with this genre and plot structure, you just KNOW what's going to happen and how it's all going to turn out.But you're not here for the plot structure to surprise you.

It doesn't fit the traditional Vampire mould, working within the genre it aims to contribute to. For example, you find yourself feeling genuinely sorry for the Blade character who has been damned from birth to fulfill this righteous role, but circumstance has him trapped between humanity he is defending, and the evil nosferatu within.One of the most horrific scenes is the opening sequence set in a nightclub, where, unbeknown to us the gentle viewer, the place is packed with vampires who get their feed at the appointed time. When this happens, the sprinkler system activates and drenches the lot of them in blood. Very nice. And the carnage at the end of this scene is breathtaking in its ordacity, yet jarring in its originality.The sequence where Blade takes sympathy on the freshly bitten love interest, and sees his mother's fate so closely matched to hers in well-staged flashbacks, will always bring a lump to the throat. But of course, Mumsie comes back for more...Other parts of the story are well executed, where Steven Dorf's portrayal of Deacon brings the term 'evil so-and-so' to new, dizzy heights. Where they discover one amongst the aristocracy that isn't of noble, pure blood, so they take him outside by Dawn's early light and give him a sun tan. mmmmm crispy. Watch the film, I don't wanna spoil it. The part where Deacon toys with the policeman, who wants ever so much to turn to the darkside, is also a classic. I watched my cat play with a ball of string, and instantly observed more than a passing similarity between the two!Overall, a hugely enjoyable film, a more-than-worthy addition to the already swelling Vampire genre, and a much prized member of my DVD collection. And, as usual, it's several million miles better than the inferior sequel, which favours muscle and guns over pure, honest, good old fashioned blood and gore!

This movie is really about two people who can't commit to anything, unlike Cusack's previous characters, who were more than willing to make a deep commitment (Loyd in Say Anything, Martin in Grosse Pointe Blank, etc.).The greatest failure of this movie was the complete lack of any twists turns, or anything of interest. When the movie ended, I felt like they had failed to include a climax to the story, which basically fits the whole movie boring.

Told with a similar, non-linear storyline the latter follows the criminal lives of many characters, some of which intersect by coincidence. Tarantino's style of film-making is often incoherent, messy, and just plain obnoxious. While one can praise his entertainment factor, it's not good enough by itself to make a remarkable film. Such is this case with 'Pulp Fiction' which often relies too much on clever editing, smart acting, and foul language.The film starts off with two lovers talking in a diner Pumpkin (Tim Roth) and Yolanda (Amanda Plummer). As they discuss previous criminal jobs, they suddenly decide to hold up the diner they're in. After they get up with guns, declaring their intentions the film goes to freeze frame and the opening credits role. To describe the entire plot of 'Pulp Fiction' would take too long, and is unnecessarily. It follows the lives of two hit men named Jules and Vincent (Academy Award nominees John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson), a Mob Boss (Ving Rhames), his oddball wife (Uma Thurman), and a boxer at the end of his prime (Bruce Willis). Intertwined among these criminal characters are a myriad of different personalities. There's the twisted Zed, the classy Winston Wolf, and of course Tarantino himself as Jimmy. These characters often come together through different segments and numerous situations. They include a desperate trip to recover a sacred Golden Watch, a case of someone very important overdosing on Heroine, and a botched getaway from a job. The cast is impressive, featuring smaller roles from the likes of Steve Buscemi, Eric Stoltz, and Christopher Walken. While Tarantino has an impressive cast list to boot, other elements of the film often go wrong.The first thing that comes to mind in Tarantino's films is dialog. He works a labyrinth of different personalities, characters, and events while connecting them with one common theme. The main interaction in 'Pulp Fiction' is violence. It is sporadic, but it comes in bursts of graphic nature. There is, like in 'Reservoir Dogs' comedy mixed in with drama and even action. However, stylistically the combination is lacking. Tarantino ultimately has to use the f-word to establish a certain emotion or mood in his screenplay, rather than relying on directional technique. The cast emotes his dialog to their best of their abilities and the tough build of Jackson is impressive. He gets into his character and fully embodies the hit-man who grows a conscious. The rest of the cast are solid, but Jackson ultimately carries the show with his hilarious delivery and tone.Technically speaking, 'Pulp Fiction' doesn't accomplish anything new. There is interesting editing by Sally Menke, although the photography by Andrzej Sekula looks dated. A good deal of Tarantino's filmography deals more with more with the sound than the look. There is a fun soundtrack thrown into the mix, but everything looks fairly standard as intended. Tarantino's direction feels off base, mainly because the material he gives himself doesn't really go anywhere. 'Sin City' is an example of a film that is purely based on style and looks, while Tarantino as a filmmaker tries to get a combination of intelligence and entertainment. As these two heads collide, things get messy. Does 'Pulp Fiction' really do anything new for cinema? There's quite a bit of swearing, yes, and the film is looked up to as something out-of-this-world but these are not striking elements. In 'Kill Bill Vol. 1' Tarantino once again heavily copies from other Kung Fu films, but in that regard he is able to create something distinctly entertaining and visually exuberant. The characters in 'Pulp Fiction' are degenerates, people who kill for a living and people who use drugs regularly. Tarantino has made personal remarks that he condemns this sort of behavior, yet the film stylizes both these elements as if there is a bigger mystique to them then there really is.In the end, I give 'Pulp Fiction' more than it's fair share of points.

For the most part, the liberal critics dismiss any discussion of its technical and dramatic strengths and instead focus entirely on the message.  The thrust of complaints against Milius and Red Dawn amount to probably some of the most disingenuous criticisms in cinematic history.  They critics argue that the audience should reject whatever Milius was trying to say (he's a conservative and board member of the NA) because the scenario is NOT REALISTIC and just a propaganda vehicle.  I've always wondered how liberals, who draw the line at it's bad when it comes to understanding war, have the gall to judge the credulity of any piece in the genre.My main objection with the Left's attack on Red Dawn is their refusal to acknowledge that Milius' focus on the Wolverines represents only a snapshot of a far larger, broader story the remains ever present in the background. When critics complain about how incredulous it is for the Soviets and their Latin allies to attack a small town in Colorado, they purposely misunderstand the message Milius explicitly delivered through the Wolverine's conversation with Col. Tanner--these kids are only a small set of actors in a much larger war.It doesn't take that much of a mental exercise necessary to justify the period's well thought out belief that the Soviets could exploit their adventures in Latin America to invade the United States.  Between Vietnam and the nuclear freeze movement, right before the Reagan build up, the West was essentially in retreat throughout the entire globe.  Whether or not the Soviets could've succeeded in this gamble is another debate, but Red Dawn is a story of extraordinary times and circumstances albeit with careful attention to the real world.Even so, the focus on the realism of Red Dawn's background story is an attempt to get away from the really other stunning aspects of the film. You may disagree with the conservative themes in this film, but one thing John Milius does very well is let his views flow naturally from the experiences of his characters and the realities of war.  There is no Rush Limbaugh avatar reaching into the film to preach through Patrick Swayze or Harry Dean Stanton, something Aaron Sorkin can't help but injecting into the endless banter that has become staple to the The West Wing.The most clever critics realize that thematically Red Dawn is a success, so they go after the acting -- after all, that's where half of Milius' conservative propaganda is coming from.  Yet more often than not they dismiss this important part of the film's success without a single attempt to specify their objections.  You might ask what people should expect in the way of expressions and dialogue from high school kids who've been conditioned into guerillas , and I can't say that the kids in the Lord of the Flies featured the timely emoting that we see from say Swayze's character when they first arrive in the mountains.  The terse, yet clearly emotional and meaningful chatter between the Wolverines is strikingly credible, and surpassed only by Harry Dean Stanton's powerful performance as a Midwestern blue collar thrown into a detention center and Ron O'Neal's slow yet well paced descent into disillusionment with his tiny slice of the war.There's wide agreement that the cinematics were decent given the budget involved and the technology of the time.  The art direction apparantly was so successful that two CIA case officers were alarmed by the attention to detail given to the T-72 main battle tank mock ups.  Over all, Red Dawn maybe one of the most original, well done pieces from the 1980s.

I'll say it straight out. Being John Malkovich is weird. VERY weird. It has random moments in it that you won't get for a few seconds, but its funny. I can't really blame Jonze for this, mostly Kaufman for conceiving the way of executing his concept - being in the mind of someone famous. This movie is sad, has great acting, flawed characters, etc. John Cusack does a good job as well as Cameron Diaz but the 2 stars of this film are Catherine Keener (oscar nominated role) as well as John Malkovich (who didn't get a nomination). The characters in this movie are unsually inconsiderate, they will destroy each other for stupid reasons. The only person you feel bad for is John Malkovich because he has to go through all of this s***. I felt this movie deserved best director and best screenplay, but it didn't win... Overall, impressive comedy, sometimes too wacky. I'd recommend seeing Adaptation over this but do as you please. 9\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"},{"date":"13 February 2003","score":"46 out of 53 people found the following review useful","review":" When I checked this one out on IMDb before watching it I was firstly surprised by the cast how do you get all those well-known actors in a film which seemed very unprepossessing and might be considered a `sleeper', made by a practically unknown director? Apart from a couple of films in the late 80s and a number of films for video with perfectly unappetising titles, Willard Carroll did not seem to be a promise living up to the great cast he assembled for this film.How wrong can you be! An excellent drama with real life issues is presented in a more live theatre style than the heart-tugging overplayed resources of more banal cinema productions. I mean, what bad luck that such a pretentious over-hyped `American Beauty' (qv) for instance, receives an avalanche of undeserved accolades, while this little gem just passes by, relatively unknown. In `Playing by Heart' you have a natural well played-out series of events without any of the overladen bombastics so frequent in American cinema. Excellent interpretations here &#150; among the best I have seen of Sean Connery, and Gena Rowlands is his perfect counterpart. Full marks for interpretation to Gillian Anderson, Jay Mohr, Dennis Quaid, Ellyn Burstyn just wonderful, as is Madeleine Stowe, and Ryan Phillipe; and it is the first film in which Angelina Jolie is not appearing only to show off her indisputable charms, as she is wont, but to play her first really convincing rôle without flashing unnecessarily her anatomy all over the place.So, evidently, full marks to Willard for piecing together all these elements to bring out what is indeed a very enjoyable surprise. Most certainly a film to see again. My only quibble is that perhaps the last ten minutes or so did not quite live up to expectations however I would not say that this factor spoils any of the impressions made during the rest of the film.My vote is a little higher than the IMDb User Rating.
