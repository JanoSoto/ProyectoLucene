After seeing that, I had to see the movie.  And I did.  I went into the movie with some mixed thoughts because I found the trailer to be great, but a lot of people were saying that the movie wasn't.  Of course, I never listen to another persons reviews.  Everyone has an opinion and rarely is it like mine.So, what's my opinion you ask?  The movie was good.  I found it to have a great story line and most of the acting was top notch.  The only acting that I didn't enjoy actually was Michael Douglas and his little girl early on.  I found that to be too cheezy.  On the other hand, I do understand why it was necessary for the story though.  Dont' get me wrong though.  It was only in that little section that Douglas' acting wasn't top notch... as usual... and that's only in my opinion.The movie itself was a terrific Psychological Thriller at it's best.  I'm sure if your here on IMDB, you know what it's all about, so I won't waste time talking of the storyline.  I will say however, that the story line was very good.  The character development was great too.  I loved all the characters and how they mixed in with each other.  I have a soft spot for these types of movies because I love it when you don't have a clue what's going on... until the end.  Movies like that are great and I will forever love them.  This one did a great job of making a type of movie I love.  I suggest going to see it if you haven't already.

And it was one of those incidents in which I was in a crowded theater where I was pretty much the ONLY one laughing at most of the gags!  It wasn't exactly embarrassing, but kind of weird.  Then again, most of the people that came to see it were mothers and fathers with little children.  Please ignore the PG-13 rating--this is NOT a movie for the young ones!  I think anyone who has seen Sandler's previous films should know that by now.  His sense of humor may be immature, but that doesn't mean it's appropriate for little eyes to see. I watched this movie again, after I bought the DVD.  First of all, I was impressed to discover the cool Easter eggs!  It's actually the first DVD to be presented in InfiniFilm.  But since it was used as an Easter egg, it wasn't credited as the first InfiniFilm feature.  Well, as I learned a lot more about the behind-the-scenes work on this movie; mostly involving special effects, makeup, costume and set design; I gained a better respect for those who were responsible for making Little Nicky.  I thought of it as more than a shallow comedy.  It's obvious that the producers of Sandler's previous films didn't have to bend over backwards to produce any flashy effects--in fact, most of them were made on a modest budget. However, the laughs faded away a little.  Since this is a silly, superficial comedy, don't expect to pick up on any subtle humor that you might've missed the first time around.  I always found Sandler's schtick very silly and meaningless.  But he's one of those guys who can make me laugh at things for no apparent reason.  Almost as if I'm laughing AT him.  I've seen Billy Madison countless times and I still roll with laughter every time.  But with Little Nicky most of the jokes that I found silly-funny on my initial viewing were just silly on my second.One thing to anticipate is a stellar cast.  You'll be surprised at the kind of celebrities that pop up in the cameos.  Some of the big-name stars include Harvey Keitel, Patricia Arquette, Quentin Tarantino, Reese Witherspoon and (my personal hero) Rodney Dangerfield!  And that's just to name a few.  It would also help if you've seen Sandler's past films, especially in one particular scene with one of our mystery cameos.  You'll be treated to a great inside joke.  And of course, expect to see many of Sandler's regulars including Allen Covert, Clint Howard, Peter Dante, Blake Clark and Jon Lovitz.    Little Nicky is not a thoughtful piece and will probably do nothing to contribute to mankind.  But it's a very funny comedy that I simply advise you don't watch over and over again.  You'll enjoy it a lot the first time!  Of course, the DVD has some really cool features, so if anything pick that up.

It's fiction under the guise of reality.  And very well done in that regard.  Blair Witch 2, on the other hand, is fiction in the guise of a dramatized re-enactment of the reality WE created, based on the fiction of the first film.  I think that's pretty cool.

How better to debunk it than to make fun of the obsession we ourselves had with its supposed reality?

The sequel merely jumps on the bandwagon of it all, while at the same time, bringing it to a grinding halt.As far as the film itself is concerned, I thought it was reasonably well done, although there are a few noteworthy lines, like Video never lies...film does, video doesn't.  Interesting concept, considering that it is the video footage at the end that is seen as the reality, not the film that we, the audience is seeing.

I thought it was stilted and boring. But, it was Star Wars, so I felt like it was my duty to defend it.Now that I've seen it again, removed from the hype and the publicity (both positive and negative), I have been won over, and I defend the movie not dutifully but enthusiastically. It is by far the most unjustly maligned movie in the Star Wars saga. The focus of everyone's ire seems to be Jar Jar Binks, who I admit is annoying--but I see him as a (mostly) failed attempt at comic relief rather than dwelling on him.I think what really upsets many people is that this is not the original Star Wars, that it isn't some kind of remake, that the joy and awe that overtook us back in 1977 hasn't been reproduced. Well, it can't be reproduced. It's been 25 years and the effects which blew us away back then have been improved upon a hundredfold, and we've seen FX-laden movie after FX-laden movie--not to mention, we are all older and more seasoned now. Lucas, to his credit, seemed to know that you simply cannot go home again when you've made a movie as groundbreaking and influential as Star Wars, and so didn't even try. He made an entirely different movie instead of aping his earlier work. Instead of the triumvirate of Star Wars (Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Princess Leia) we get a whole host of new characters, with a few familiar faces (R2-D2 and C3PO) or familiar names (Obi Wan Kenobi, as a young man rather than an old man) thrown in.Boring, bad dialogue, horrible acting. Those are all accusations that have been leveled at Menace. And they're all ill-founded. I find the dialogue-heavy scenes every bit as exciting as the pod race and the final lightsaber battle. Why? Because I enjoy finding out back story. I enjoy finding out what, exactly, led up to the events of the OT (Original Trilogy)--what the pre-Empire galaxy was like, how Emperor Palpatine came to power, what kind of people Luke Skywalker's parents were.As for the bad dialogue accusation, I will admit there are some cringe-worthy lines, but the same is true of the OT. In fact, the script for Menace has fewer cringe-worthy lines than any of the films in the OT. It has a concise, well-put-together screenplay, with a more complex plot than Star Wars fans are accustomed to. True, it lacks the smart-alecky humor that characterized the OT (indeed, many have notied that it could have benefitted from the addition of a Han Solo type character, a wisecracking disbeliever, and I agree on that point), but I am willing to forgive that more readily than many.Now onto the acting. Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker gets all the ire that isn't reserved for Jar Jar Binks. My opinion is that he isn't acting. He's being himself. He's a nine-year-old kid playing a nine-year-old kid, who suddenly gets to play with all these cool toys. I have seen better child actors, but I have seen worse child actors too. Jake Lloyd does a perfectly acceptable job, no better or worse than many actors in the Star Wars saga as a whole.As for the rest of the actors, they are fine. Some of them are actually good. Liam Neeson brings a great deal of subtlety and gentle humor to his role as Jedi Master Qui Gon Jinn. Pernilla August is dignified and moving as the mother of a gifted child (Anakin) in a cruel universe. Natalie Portman is convincing both as the necessarily icy and unemotional Queen Amidala and as the warmer, yet still noble, Padme. And then there is Ian McDiarmid, who all but oozes evil as Senator (future Emperor) Palpatine. Instead of the two-dimensional, cackling villain we get in Return of the Jedi, Palpatine is ruthless but subtle, a deceptively gentle-voiced schemer who artfully manipulates his way to a position of power. Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan Kenobi is not given much to do, but what he is given, he carries of with aplomb. In fact, I can't think of a really bad performance in this movie. At worst, the actors are overly restrained.I hope someday that the bashing this film has received will die away and people will give it another chance. It really is a good movie.

He's a nine-year-old kid playing a nine-year-old kid, who suddenly gets to play with all these cool toys. I have seen better child actors, but I have seen worse child actors too. Jake Lloyd does a perfectly acceptable job, no better or worse than many actors in the Star Wars saga as a whole.As for the rest of the actors, they are fine. Some of them are actually good. Liam Neeson brings a great deal of subtlety and gentle humor to his role as Jedi Master Qui Gon Jinn. Pernilla August is dignified and moving as the mother of a gifted child (Anakin) in a cruel universe. Natalie Portman is convincing both as the necessarily icy and unemotional Queen Amidala and as the warmer, yet still noble, Padme. And then there is Ian McDiarmid, who all but oozes evil as Senator (future Emperor) Palpatine. Instead of the two-dimensional, cackling villain we get in Return of the Jedi, Palpatine is ruthless but subtle, a deceptively gentle-voiced schemer who artfully manipulates his way to a position of power. Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan Kenobi is not given much to do, but what he is given, he carries of with aplomb. In fact, I can't think of a really bad performance in this movie. At worst, the actors are overly restrained.I hope someday that the bashing this film has received will die away and people will give it another chance. It really is a good movie.

I thought it was stilted and boring. But, it was Star Wars, so I felt like it was my duty to defend it.Now that I've seen it again, removed from the hype and the publicity (both positive and negative), I have been won over, and I defend the movie not dutifully but enthusiastically. It is by far the most unjustly maligned movie in the Star Wars saga. The focus of everyone's ire seems to be Jar Jar Binks, who I admit is annoying--but I see him as a (mostly) failed attempt at comic relief rather than dwelling on him.I think what really upsets many people is that this is not the original Star Wars, that it isn't some kind of remake, that the joy and awe that overtook us back in 1977 hasn't been reproduced. Well, it can't be reproduced. It's been 25 years and the effects which blew us away back then have been improved upon a hundredfold, and we've seen FX-laden movie after FX-laden movie--not to mention, we are all older and more seasoned now. Lucas, to his credit, seemed to know that you simply cannot go home again when you've made a movie as groundbreaking and influential as Star Wars, and so didn't even try. He made an entirely different movie instead of aping his earlier work. Instead of the triumvirate of Star Wars (Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Princess Leia) we get a whole host of new characters, with a few familiar faces (R2-D2 and C3PO) or familiar names (Obi Wan Kenobi, as a young man rather than an old man) thrown in.Boring, bad dialogue, horrible acting. Those are all accusations that have been leveled at Menace. And they're all ill-founded. I find the dialogue-heavy scenes every bit as exciting as the pod race and the final lightsaber battle. Why? Because I enjoy finding out back story. I enjoy finding out what, exactly, led up to the events of the OT (Original Trilogy)--what the pre-Empire galaxy was like, how Emperor Palpatine came to power, what kind of people Luke Skywalker's parents were.As for the bad dialogue accusation, I will admit there are some cringe-worthy lines, but the same is true of the OT. In fact, the script for Menace has fewer cringe-worthy lines than any of the films in the OT. It has a concise, well-put-together screenplay, with a more complex plot than Star Wars fans are accustomed to. True, it lacks the smart-alecky humor that characterized the OT (indeed, many have notied that it could have benefitted from the addition of a Han Solo type character, a wisecracking disbeliever, and I agree on that point), but I am willing to forgive that more readily than many.Now onto the acting.

Perhaps audiences today are less sophisticated - having been brought up on a diet of poor action movies and even poorer Star Trek 'science fiction'. Mission to Mars has a more realistic basis, is less flashy - and I don't think there's even one explosion in the whole film.If you enjoyed Contact or 2001 and want more of the same, then Mission to Mars is a definite must-watch. It's a shame that a quality film like this is getting panned so badly, as movie studios are more likely to avoid similar projects in the future. Would 2001 be made today ? I doubt it.

I have to admit that I also found his performance hilarious in some parts!  Vincent D'Onofrio is also brilliant as the slow-witted recruit pushed to the brink of madness. Not to be a spoiler, but the final scene in the bathroom between him and Ermey is chilling and haunting and unforgettable, I will never forget the expression of madness on his face.  The second part during Vietnam is also very well done, Kubrick makes effective use of darkness and slow motion especially during the sniper attack scene.

When I first saw this in the theatre upon it's initial release, I really indentified with it. Upon viewing it seven years later, I realized what a whiny, early-twentysomething I was back then. This movie is incredibly pretentious and makes my generation look like a bunch of babies with dirty diapers. Unfortunately, in the mid 90's, that's exactly how most people my age acted. We felt we deserved the world on a silver platter... and cried when it wasn't handed to us.The characters, by 2001 standards, are all horrible mid-90's stereotypes. Hawke, Ryder and Garofolo's characters are painfully self-absorbed. Especially Hakwe's character Troy, he is supposed to be deep and intellectual, but after viewing the film in 2001, his serious slacker persona is almost comical. Lelaina (Ryder) is upset because she can't land her dream job immediately after college. (who does?!?) Vickie (Garofolo) is basically a slut who works at the Gap. She talks about AIDS tests as being a defining point of Gen X. This never happened and makes the film seem even more dated. I won't go too much into the story, but it's basically a love triangle between Troy (Hawke), Lelaina (Ryder) and the nice-guy yuppie Michael (Stiller). The early-mid 90's stamp is all over the story, as Stiller's successful-nice guy character is dumped for the slacker with few redeeming qualities (Hawke). In 1994 I saw Michael as square and Troy seemed pretty damned slick and cool. In 2001, I think Michael would be vacationing on the French Riviera, while Troy would be selling used cars. Amazing the difference in attitude seven years make. Technically, the movie is well done. Stiller does a pretty good job directing and gets admirable performances from his cast. Especially the supporting actors Kurtz, Mahoney and an underused Steve Zahn. The soundtrack is excellent and holds up to the test of time much better than the film or soundtracks from similar movies.
