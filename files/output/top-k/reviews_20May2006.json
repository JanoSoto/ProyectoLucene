[{"date":"20 May 2006","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Ang Lee is one of a small group of directors who rarely make a disappointing film. Ride with the Devil contains many elements that are woven together to provide an absorbing film. These include gritty, realistic action sequences, stunning cinematography, a fascinating romance, terrific dialogue, great acting and a well crafted plot. I had been unaware of this aspect of the American Civil War and the film brings home just how divisive such a conflict is. Tobey Maguire is spot on but all of the cast contribute to a powerful experience. Watch this for a film that is about giving you superb entertainment and not a cynical attempt to cash in at the box office.
