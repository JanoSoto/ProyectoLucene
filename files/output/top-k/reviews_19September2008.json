The film has been rhapsodized by international film critics as Kieslowski's 'coming out' film, but one can see it is clearly a bridge between the direction he was headed with his TV series The Decalogue, and where he ended up in the Trilogy.The film is not linear, which is the first thing that separates it from the typical Hollywood, and even contemporary European, films, but there is a cloying coyness to the film's reliance on synchronicities and contrivances that is more pronounced than in the Trilogy, where the errors Kieslowski made here were modulated. A film, or any work of art, that has a number of interpretations is exciting, but one with unlimited interpretations is a cheat, and reeks of narrative laziness. The Double Life Of Véronique falls just short of going too far, but the relentless scenes of cogitation for the sake of cogitation- and revealing lead actress Irène Jacob's lovely face and body, border on the obsessive; which would not be a bad thing, considering a good portion of the film's tale is on that topic, but the plain fact is that there is nothing new brought to the table on said topic.Many critics have read so much nonsense into the film- such as the early death of Weronika absurdly representing Poland's absorption into the Soviet Bloc- in this most apolitical of films, that such readings only highlight the film's greatest failure- a lack of coherence. Yes, the film has to be given some latitude, narratively, but open endedness, to a fault, is still a fault. That Kiesloski did not repeat this in his later films is a recognition of this fact, and may explain his near obsessive need for tying up the ends of the Three Colors Trilogy in Red. Such things as how Alexandre got Weronika's possessions? Could he be the lover that Weronika was leaving Antek for? After all, he's famous and travels. Thus his later obsession with her twin, when he meets her, would have psychological resonance, as well as explain his stalking and sending of things. One can resist the temptation to figure out every last detail in a film like this, for much does not stand up to intellectual scrutiny, but to not ground the narrative in some bit of internal diegetic reality is to rob the film of its solid foundation.The Double Life Of Véronique ultimately misses greatness, if by a hair, because of these flaws- such as its too contrived, and lacking in chemistry, romance, for it often tries to force its implausible mystery at the viewer, rather than letting it evolve more subtly. In this way, its directed ending- even if more mysterious, is actually more in line with the Pulp Fiction sort of storytelling than that in the Three Colors Trilogy, which might explain why The Double Life Of Véronique was highly awarded, whereas Red lost out to Quentin Tarantino's convoluted yet plot driven film at that year's Cannes Film Festival. The ending, where Alexandre tells Véronique of his plan for a book similar to the film is simply too much, and such preciousness is a flaw in the screenplay by Kieslowski and Piesiewicz. One wonders what a greater screenwriter, like Bergman, could have done with these ideas. He certainly would have muted some of the obviousness, for even in Persona- another overrated, but greater, film, he does not go so far as to have the two aspects of what could be one person\/persona played by a single actress. Thus, the film relies more on its strengths- which are undoubtedly great the acting of the sensual yet innocent Jacob, and the evocative imagery, where the narrative's oneiric progression works best in its hermetic cosmos, crafting the dialogue of the two women from silence, even as the camera fixates on the radiant Jacob.I wonder if Kieslowski was aware of the scientific studies done on twins separated at birth, and if this fact influenced this film, even to the point that the two women were, indeed, twins- one adopted by a Polish family, and the other by a French family? Such a hint that this might be the case could be evinced through further watchings, which I shall engage in, and which might just raise this slyly intriguing cocktease of a film above the bar for greatness. Until that time, however, I am left with the critical truism that while the narrative interior of a film can get away with not being analyzed too closely, the same cannot always be said for its exterior workings. This is why the film left me with a lack, yet why I also will view it again. Sometimes success and failure can have the same result. Other times not. Just ask Weronika\/Véronique.

Unlike other 'so called' masterpieces out there, Fargo's genuine emotional appeal cannot be described. It is enough to just watch the film. Yes, it is disturbing, sometimes a little too much, but that mixed in with amazingly memorable characters, makes for a truly amazing ride. It is a simple kidnapping movie, but the way events fold out, and unfold themselves are so bizarre, that it is even original(something that is hard to grasp these days).A strong part of this film is the acting. William H. Macy plays Jerry Lundegaard, a character that is sometimes mixed with fright and worry, and Macy gives such a well done performance. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormware are great as the two kidnappers, Buscemi actually giving a performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. But the greatest performance has to come from Frances McDormand, who plays her character of Police Chief Marge Gunderson so well, mixed with quirkiness so well, this is a true landmark for acting. Usually dramatic performances capture scenes, but McDormand captures every scene with her charm. One of the best performances of the 90's. Mixed with the acting are the strong sides to the film. The cinematography is so real and gorgeous, the film editing flawless, the music score so originally made, they all enhance the experience more.All in all, Fargo is a perfect film. It has a lot of themes inside of it, and they all come out sooner or later. But unlike theme-filled movies, this is a joy to watch. This is what films should be. They should entertain, but also react strongly to the audience and enhance us in different ways. This is Joel and Ethan Coen's best films. There is no way they could beat this. It is just difficult to describe how truly great it is. And unlike most 1990's famous films, Fargo is not overrated in such a way that people call it to be so 'important'. Fargo is, after second thoughts, the best film of the 90's.

In my opinion, he started out with two reasonable installments in the franchise, Live and Let Die and The Man with the Golden Gun, and then the franchise improved with The Spy Who Loved Me. Sadly, however, the James Bond movie franchise had a hard fall after that with Moonraker. I would say For Your Eyes Only, the first one made after that highly criticised sci-fi Bond film, turned out to be an improvement, but not as much of an improvement as I hoped for when I watched it recently.A British military spy ship sinks near a Warsaw Pact country after hitting a mine, and the ATAC, a communications system, goes down with it. Whoever gets their hands on this device will have control over all Polaris nuclear missiles! So, a marine archaeologist named Sir Timothy Havelock is asked by the British government to locate the wreck of the ship, but before he can send in his report, he and his Greek wife are killed by a Cuban hit-man named Hector Gonzales, leaving their daughter, Melina, who survives the attack! James Bond is then assigned to recover the ATAC, before it ends up in the wrong hands! On his mission, he meets Melina Havelock, who is seeking to avenge the murder of her parents, and the two team up for the investigation. Obviously, a number of life-threatening challenges await, with enemies sometimes nearby! The opening sequence, before the theme song, shows Bond leaving flowers at his late wife's grave, and going from there to a battle against a familiar foe. This opening sequence is promising, and ends rather humorously. However, from there, the film goes into the theme song, a soft ballad performed by Sheena Easton, which seems out of place in a spy thriller, especially coming right after that opening sequence, which doesn't quite leave the viewer in the mood for a song like that. Through the rest of the 2 hr.+ film, I can't say there aren't any thrilling moments. In fact, there are quite a few of those, such as more than one memorable chase scene. As you would probably expect from a Bond film starring Moore, there's also humour, especially at the end, I would say. Unfortunately, with the thrills and the laughs, there are also some flaws. Bibi Dahl, the teenage ice-skater who appears frequently in the film, I found a tad annoying, not funny (like she's apparently supposed to be), and I know I'm not alone. Also, the scene where Bond and Melina meet underwater with romantic music put to it is just ridiculous! Clearly, For Your Eyes Only is more popular than the widely lambasted Moonraker, and I'm sure many consider it a vast improvement after that film, but not me, I can only consider it a slight improvement, not quite enough to put the franchise back on track. The three flaws I've mentioned aren't quite enough to describe why I'm not too impressed with this 1981 spy thriller, but I'm not exactly sure how to fully explain the rest. Well, as usual, this Bond film is rather long at over two hours, and this is one of the cases where they just couldn't quite keep it consistent enough throughout its long run. I don't know what else to say about this particular installment in the long official James Bond movie franchise, except that if you like spy thrillers, this one might do, but you also just might find that certain flaws really get in the way at times.

Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson play Enid and Rebecca, two moody teenagers who deem others to be phony and contrived; everyone belongs to a clique or a group, and all these groups are seen, by the girls, to be devoid of any worthwhile substance.The film is comprised of three very broad sections. Its first act consists of our duo snidely critiquing the world around them. Filtered through their angsty eyes, everything is devoid of value and people lack sophistication, filling their times with banal activities, much hypocrisy and pointless gestures. Time and time again, characters are shown to lack depth, lacking even the most basic appreciation for knowledge, quality or craftsmanship.Enid and Rebecca, of course, believe themselves to be different. Elitist, snobbish and aloof, they're also somewhat right, budding artists who constantly observe and chart what goes on around them. This acute perception, however, makes them sick. If ignorance is bliss, how can these two enlightened teens exist in a world so unenlightened and vacuous? Plato called art and philosophy the highest occupations precisely because they are profoundly useless. It's only via understanding and observing, he said, that man is able to elevate himself above the routines of animal life. The downside is, self-reflexivity can engender ghost-like isolation and elitism. Eventually the quest for understanding can lead to an outright disidetification with the herd, as well as alienation and depression, which is the passage which Zwigoff's heroes undergo.After college, Enid and Rebecca are thus faced with an important question. What next? How do they function in this world and where do they go? Rebecca's answer is to throw away her artistic sensibilities and adopt a more practical view of life. She gets a job, buys an apartment and becomes, in Enid's eyes, just another faceless peon. She just wants to be normal. This is paradoxically seen as both a step forward into adulthood and a regressive step back into childishness. Yes Rebecca grows up and assumes adult responsibilities, Enid thinks, but her responsibilities are based on a child's view of what an adult should be. In one great shot, Rebecca stands before an ironing board, her transformation into womanhood complete. But she's so wrapped up in actually getting on with life, that she hasn't the time or inclination to stop and ponder the monster she's become. But is Enid any more mature? And so Enid sulks. She can't accept Rebecca's blissful ignorance. She needs to find something else. But what? The answer, of course, seems to be in signing up to an art college. Isn't this where all morose, sensitive outcasts go? But no, even this art class seems like pretentious, hypocritical nonsense. Like Holden Caulfield, poor Enid rejects it all.The second act of the film deals with Enid falling in love with Seymore, played by Steve Buscemi. He's a middle aged man who lives in the past, collecting old records and antiques. You think this is healthy, he says, I can't connect with people so I fill my life with this stuff. The film's big irony is that everyone collects and does routine stuff, Seymore and Enid just have an awareness of why it's done. Self-reflection suffocates.Unsurprisingly, the film incessantly rants against pop culture. The radio annoys Seymore, with it's constant advertising and pompous DJs. I feel like I'm being jabbed in the face, he says and earlier in the film, a customer moans at a video store clerk for not stocking Fellini's 8 ½ (yet the store has the Kim Basinger sex film 9 ½ weeks). There's some other subtle symbolism in the film Enid constantly tries to latch on to past fashion trends and musical genres, Enid tries desperately to create an identity for herself, an outdated pair of Levis always seems to be strewn on the sidewalk, there are two garage sales yet the same record is sold in each etc etc.It's also interesting that Enid and Rebecca are only sexually attracted to specific types of boys. At the start of the film, Enid sympathises with a guy called Dennis and both girls are attracted to another kid called Josh. Why? Because both these guys have that genuine rarity of being exactly what they appear to be. No pretence. No attempts to be cool. Even though Dennis is a dweeb, he isn't trying to be anything else. And Josh, a dishevelled kid, seems open and honest. The girls feel a connection because these kids represent some form of authenticity.The last act of the film deals with Enid trying to set Seymore up on a date. Symbolically, she understands that if she can get an outcast like Seymore to function in society, then maybe there is hope for her too. Unfortunately, Seymore's relationship with his date falls apart. Enid, feeling hopeless, thus hops on board a bus. She wants to leave town, maybe even travel the world in the hopes of finding herself or something she can rationalise latching onto. One can view this ending with optimism, but it's also naive to assume that Enid's internal problem can be solved by changing her external surroundings. The film thus ends on very much the same note as George Lucas' American Graffeti, the artist flying away, a sense of sad possibility lingering in the air.Aesthetically the film is simply, but well shot; like a live action version of MTV's Daria. The tone is quirky and light, but Zwigoff's a good enough artist to recognise the weight of his drama.8.5\/10- Terry Zwigoff has made 3 pretty great films thus far (Bad Santa, Ghost World and Crumb). See too American Graffiti, Ratatouille, Harold and Maude, Lumet's Running on Empty and The Wanderers.

Like Holden Caulfield, poor Enid rejects it all.The second act of the film deals with Enid falling in love with Seymore, played by Steve Buscemi. He's a middle aged man who lives in the past, collecting old records and antiques. You think this is healthy, he says, I can't connect with people so I fill my life with this stuff. The film's big irony is that everyone collects and does routine stuff, Seymore and Enid just have an awareness of why it's done. Self-reflection suffocates.Unsurprisingly, the film incessantly rants against pop culture. The radio annoys Seymore, with it's constant advertising and pompous DJs. I feel like I'm being jabbed in the face, he says and earlier in the film, a customer moans at a video store clerk for not stocking Fellini's 8 ½ (yet the store has the Kim Basinger sex film 9 ½ weeks). There's some other subtle symbolism in the film Enid constantly tries to latch on to past fashion trends and musical genres, Enid tries desperately to create an identity for herself, an outdated pair of Levis always seems to be strewn on the sidewalk, there are two garage sales yet the same record is sold in each etc etc.It's also interesting that Enid and Rebecca are only sexually attracted to specific types of boys. At the start of the film, Enid sympathises with a guy called Dennis and both girls are attracted to another kid called Josh. Why? Because both these guys have that genuine rarity of being exactly what they appear to be. No pretence. No attempts to be cool. Even though Dennis is a dweeb, he isn't trying to be anything else. And Josh, a dishevelled kid, seems open and honest. The girls feel a connection because these kids represent some form of authenticity.The last act of the film deals with Enid trying to set Seymore up on a date. Symbolically, she understands that if she can get an outcast like Seymore to function in society, then maybe there is hope for her too. Unfortunately, Seymore's relationship with his date falls apart. Enid, feeling hopeless, thus hops on board a bus. She wants to leave town, maybe even travel the world in the hopes of finding herself or something she can rationalise latching onto. One can view this ending with optimism, but it's also naive to assume that Enid's internal problem can be solved by changing her external surroundings. The film thus ends on very much the same note as George Lucas' American Graffeti, the artist flying away, a sense of sad possibility lingering in the air.Aesthetically the film is simply, but well shot; like a live action version of MTV's Daria. The tone is quirky and light, but Zwigoff's a good enough artist to recognise the weight of his drama.8.5\/10- Terry Zwigoff has made 3 pretty great films thus far (Bad Santa, Ghost World and Crumb).

Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson play Enid and Rebecca, two moody teenagers who deem others to be phony and contrived; everyone belongs to a clique or a group, and all these groups are seen, by the girls, to be devoid of any worthwhile substance.The film is comprised of three very broad sections. Its first act consists of our duo snidely critiquing the world around them. Filtered through their angsty eyes, everything is devoid of value and people lack sophistication, filling their times with banal activities, much hypocrisy and pointless gestures. Time and time again, characters are shown to lack depth, lacking even the most basic appreciation for knowledge, quality or craftsmanship.Enid and Rebecca, of course, believe themselves to be different. Elitist, snobbish and aloof, they're also somewhat right, budding artists who constantly observe and chart what goes on around them. This acute perception, however, makes them sick. If ignorance is bliss, how can these two enlightened teens exist in a world so unenlightened and vacuous? Plato called art and philosophy the highest occupations precisely because they are profoundly useless. It's only via understanding and observing, he said, that man is able to elevate himself above the routines of animal life. The downside is, self-reflexivity can engender ghost-like isolation and elitism. Eventually the quest for understanding can lead to an outright disidetification with the herd, as well as alienation and depression, which is the passage which Zwigoff's heroes undergo.After college, Enid and Rebecca are thus faced with an important question. What next? How do they function in this world and where do they go? Rebecca's answer is to throw away her artistic sensibilities and adopt a more practical view of life. She gets a job, buys an apartment and becomes, in Enid's eyes, just another faceless peon. She just wants to be normal. This is paradoxically seen as both a step forward into adulthood and a regressive step back into childishness. Yes Rebecca grows up and assumes adult responsibilities, Enid thinks, but her responsibilities are based on a child's view of what an adult should be. In one great shot, Rebecca stands before an ironing board, her transformation into womanhood complete. But she's so wrapped up in actually getting on with life, that she hasn't the time or inclination to stop and ponder the monster she's become. But is Enid any more mature? And so Enid sulks. She can't accept Rebecca's blissful ignorance. She needs to find something else. But what? The answer, of course, seems to be in signing up to an art college. Isn't this where all morose, sensitive outcasts go? But no, even this art class seems like pretentious, hypocritical nonsense.

They are dull, plodding, and preachy- like Brokeback Mountain, Crash, Monster, Million Dollar Baby, Titanic, Saving Private Ryan, or Schindler's List. Then there are films that are thought of as bad, but unfairly so. And it's not that they are particularly good films, but merely solid, serviceable films that entertain.One of the best examples of this sort of film that has been unfairly critically maligned is the 1956 Universal-International sci fi\/horror film The Mole People. Yes, with that title and made in that decade, one might think that this short, 77 minute long black and white B film is along the lines of the first three mentioned films, or even worse films that lack humor as a redeemer, such as Killers From Space or Devil Girl From Mars. Yet, it actually is a film that has ideas, and is much better than many of the other films that, like it, were parodied on the TV show Mystery Science Theater 3000. Yes, the ideas are silly, and a stretch, but this attempt at seriousness is portrayed from the start in a three minute prologue to the film where a supposed USC professor, Dr. Frank C. Baxter, gives a history of belief in worlds inside the earth. Whether or not Baxter was really a professor at USC is a subject for debate online. Some critics claim he was (and he seems to be, if one Googles his name), and did the film as a favor to the producer, while others claim it an act, just as was used in several Ed Wood films, to lend authenticity. Yet, it works in a kitsch way, especially when the professor intones about the wonders of modern 'SCIENCE'- that catch-all phrase from the 50s, which could explain any monster, alien, mutation, or horror.Aside from its influence on later sci fi films, Agar gets off a great line that presages the 1960s, when he comments on the Sumerians' habits of eating mushrooms and wonders if they've ever smoked dried mushrooms. It's a small moment, but one that, if seen in the right light, is both comic and subversive, as well as damned insightful into what such a character might be thinking about in such a silly situation. The Mole People is not great cinema, nor even great sci fi in a B mode, and its social commentary is not very deep nor illuminating (yes, slavery is bad), but it has its moments, and it does entertain. It also has John Agar, one of those indelible actors who, for better or worse, is unforgettable in every role he takes on- something even very few A list actors can boast.

The commentary track by Morgan and Burstein is superb, one of the best explications of the marriage of technique with subject matter you're likely to hear.A cynic might argue that the film is an homage to a talentless actor who just had a knack for being in the right place at the right time, and to a degree that's true. But, the film is really about the solipsistic nature of all people. We know that. We are that, by and large. It's only when we see that in people richer, more famous, and more rewarded that we look away from ourselves. The film opens with a quote from Evans 'There are three sides to every story my side, your side, and the truth. And no one is lying. Memories shared serve each one differently.' Rarely has such truth been admitted by anyone in film, rarer still something done with it. This is why The Kid Stays In The Picture is a great documentary.

Howard Hawks delivers an adaptation of Ben Hecht's play, The Front Page, that is funnier and more fine tuned than most comedies today. This film's influence is still felt today with movies like Clerks and Pulp Fiction with their quick and witty dialogue.From the beginning, this film will hypnotize you with its ultra fast dialogue. The exchanges seems so meticulously rehearsed and prepared. Characters hit their lines with complete perfection and air-tight pace. There is probably ten seconds in the whole film where nothing is being said. This masterful use of dialogue can easily be credited to director Hawks, but it is the performance of Cary Grant that drives this film. He plays a corrupt, immoral, and unethical newspaper editor who forces us to like him. The entire film shows us how evil a newspaper can be but it shows us from their point of view. This enables us to empathize with Cary Grant and his staff. They lie to and set up Bruce Baldwin. That should make us dislike them and position them as the villains of the film. However, Cary Grant's performance is so engaging that we end up admiring the level of power he has and the intelligence he displays. He takes what would be a villain in most movies and makes him likable. He almost acts as a lawyer or politician with how slick he is. His upbeat delivery of lines and dry humor show the dialogue in another light, from his point of view. His intentions are to serve his newspaper and his ex-wife, Hildy. This film should be re-released today so people can see what real comedy is. Not just some random and pointless comment that makes no sense we can't help but laugh. That seems to be what comedy is today (Family Guy, Dane Cook, Seth Rogen, etc.). His Girl Friday is a smart comedy with relevant jokes that build character.Go see it.

Robinson with a gifted perception of his capabilities as Christopher Cross (Chris Cross, get it?), a meek banker and recreational painter, and this careful and resourceful noir opens at a dinner honoring him for his long career at the bank. On his way home, a friend invites Chris to take the train, as per his typical algorithm. Chris has something on his mind however, and chooses to walk instead. And with the snap of the fingers, a match point of the tennis ball on the net, his life changes forever. As soon as he makes that seemingly meaningless, impromptu decision, he helps Joan Bennett, a femme fatale who is evidently being assaulted by a man. Almost immediately, he is captivated by her as his own life at home is controlled by his oppressive who worships her previous husband, a cop who drowned while struggling to rescue a woman.We care a great deal about Chris because he is a common man. He lets people walk all over him. We hate his wife. We find his job as boring as he does. We can identify with his love of something he never quite got to do as much as he wanted to, which is painting, and as of his remarks concerning his appreciation of it, Bennett misguidedly thinks him a prosperous painter. It happens that the attacker was Bennett's brutish boyfriend, played with Dan Duryea's exceptional ability to be not quite evil and not quite intimidating but just a sniveling jerk, with whom she was quarrelling over money. Duryea encourages her to go in for a relationship with Cross, so as to wring money from him. Kitty entices Cross to rent an apartment for her, one that can also be his art studio. They take a high-priced apartment in earlier times enjoyed by Diego Rivera. One appreciates Edward G. Robinson's character and how the stress and burden of being a living bathmat for everyone else has shaped his actions, and how the world around him is in a sense slowly but surely receiving their just desserts, merely by his uncoiling.He is thrilled and, as we sense without it necessary for the film to demonstrate, unstoppable, in recapturing the dreams of his younger years that have eluded him. To bankroll this confidential life, Cross embezzles from the bank. In the meantime, Duryea takes a crack at selling some of Cross's paintings, catching the attention of a celebrated art critic. Bennett acts as if she painted them, enchanting the critic, who guarantees her a career. When Cross's wife sees her husband's paintings in a money-making art gallery as the work of someone else, she accuses him of cloning this commercial artist's work. Cross understands that he can sell his paintings under Bennett's name, and with enthusiasm consents to her being the known face of his work.Though we are aware early on of the deception against Edward G. Robinson's character, we are still stunned by some of the directions the film takes after this point. The script is pitch- perfect as many of its events border on implausible but never seem to slip over that fence, because Scarlet Street is essential a dark story of how twists of fate and lottery wins of chance can be traps in spite of how little one can blame someone like Robinson for taking advantage of them.

The Conversation (1974), written and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is not one of those minor works. It has a manifest endebtedness to Michelangelo Antonioni's brilliant 1966 film, Blowup, yet it does not merely ape that film's existential dilemma of an accidental photograph possibly cluing its lead character into murder. Instead, The Conversation probes far more deeply into its lead character Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) and his life, to see what might cause a man to misinterpret reality to suit his own psychic needs.Another major difference is that the tale in Blowup is one that is wholly accidental, whereas the story The Conversation is built upon is an outgrowth of the deliberate and paid for actions of Caul, the leading West Coast surveillance expert, who has been hired by the mysterious Director (Robert Duvall) of a giant corporation to spy on his wife Ann (Cindy Williams) and her lover Mark (Frederick Forrest). The film opens, around Christmastime, with Caul and his entourage tailing and listening in to the conversation of the two lovers as they stroll in Union Square, an open air park in downtown San Francisco. The fragmented bits of conversation he pieces together only later, and comes to feel that the couple is being set up for murder by his employer. The opening zoom down from a sniper's eye level, focuses on a mime (Robert Shields) who is annoying people in the square. Eventually he sidles up to and mimics Caul, who walks away. The opening scene was filmed by Haskell Wexler, and the rest of the film by Bill Butler, who took over after Wexler and Coppola had a falling out.It is a shame that in the nearly thirty years since the 1970s, Coppola has never made a film that comes close to the power of his films from that era. Despite its debt to Blowup, The Conversation is a far more realistic and multi-layered film. That does not mean it's better nor worse than Blowup, just not a ripoff. It is far more internalized, even if a little less subjective, than the earlier film. This seeming disconnect between the objective and that witnessed by the audience only deepens the desire to rewatch the film. Especially great is the fact that the film's lead is the sort of character other films ignore, to focus on one of the players in the love triangle, or perhaps Martin Stett. Caul is a functionary, an apparatchik- yet he's real, and his struggle is every bit as interesting as the 'sexier characters'. Yet Coppola heeds Juvenal's query from his sixth Satire 'Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?' ('Who watches the watchmen?') There are many watchers in this film, yet the final watcher is the audience, and what they watch is greatness, simple in its complexity.The Conversation is a great, simple, and small film, never too long at an hour and fifty-three minutes, and it may be Coppola's best. It was very timely, considering the milieu of Watergate, but the idea came to him in 1967. It started filming in late 1972, and wrapped shortly before Watergate came to light, yet it has been lost between the three other titanic films he made in the 1970s The Godfather, The Godfather, Part II, and Apocalypse Now. Whereas those three films were operatic, this film is a chamber piece, and apropos of that, the piano only soundtrack by Coppola's brother in law David Shire, so reminiscent of Erik Satie piano pieces, is perfect, for, as Coppola says in his commentary, the piano is a lonely instrument; lonely as Harry Caul, or an unanswered question.

The opening zoom down from a sniper's eye level, focuses on a mime (Robert Shields) who is annoying people in the square. Eventually he sidles up to and mimics Caul, who walks away. The opening scene was filmed by Haskell Wexler, and the rest of the film by Bill Butler, who took over after Wexler and Coppola had a falling out.It is a shame that in the nearly thirty years since the 1970s, Coppola has never made a film that comes close to the power of his films from that era. Despite its debt to Blowup, The Conversation is a far more realistic and multi-layered film. That does not mean it's better nor worse than Blowup, just not a ripoff. It is far more internalized, even if a little less subjective, than the earlier film. This seeming disconnect between the objective and that witnessed by the audience only deepens the desire to rewatch the film. Especially great is the fact that the film's lead is the sort of character other films ignore, to focus on one of the players in the love triangle, or perhaps Martin Stett. Caul is a functionary, an apparatchik- yet he's real, and his struggle is every bit as interesting as the 'sexier characters'. Yet Coppola heeds Juvenal's query from his sixth Satire 'Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?' ('Who watches the watchmen?') There are many watchers in this film, yet the final watcher is the audience, and what they watch is greatness, simple in its complexity.The Conversation is a great, simple, and small film, never too long at an hour and fifty-three minutes, and it may be Coppola's best. It was very timely, considering the milieu of Watergate, but the idea came to him in 1967. It started filming in late 1972, and wrapped shortly before Watergate came to light, yet it has been lost between the three other titanic films he made in the 1970s The Godfather, The Godfather, Part II, and Apocalypse Now. Whereas those three films were operatic, this film is a chamber piece, and apropos of that, the piano only soundtrack by Coppola's brother in law David Shire, so reminiscent of Erik Satie piano pieces, is perfect, for, as Coppola says in his commentary, the piano is a lonely instrument; lonely as Harry Caul, or an unanswered question.
