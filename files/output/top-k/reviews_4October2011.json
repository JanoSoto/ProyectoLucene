Soon they're able to reclaim their friend but not before some of his furry friends are fed after midnight and the green gremlins take over a high-tech building. GREMLINS 2 is a rare example of where the sequel is much better than the original film. The original movie was cute in its own right but I just didn't feel there was enough backbone to the human characters to really make it work. With that said, it might sound hypocritical for me to say that I enjoyed this film so much because the humans for the most part are just an after thought and the gremlins are given full control of the story. Using the word story might not be the wises thing to do because the only thing we really get are a bunch of green guys causing trouble in this building before getting out in the streets of New York. I think the greatest thing going for the film is the way director Joe Dante knows how to make satire and spoof things all around him. In one of the film's highlights, the original movie wasn't overly loved by film critics and in a hilarious cameo the gremlins attack Leonard Maltin who is bashing the first film. Another hilarious bit as the gremlins overtaking a TV cooking show where the attack the host and then go about making their own food. I thought the majority of the gremlin characters were perfectly done and given quite a bit of personality and room to grow. There are many great creatures including one who becomes a genius after drinking some brain fluid and there's another hilarious joke on Lon Chaney's THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. The jokes are flying about ten a minute and the film is so wild, frantic and fast-paced that you can't help but feel as if you're head is spinning. That's certainly not a negative thing because the majority of the jokes work very well. The human parts aren't given as much screen time but we do get some funny bits with them. Dick Miller nearly steals the film reprising his role from the first film and we even get nice bits from Jackie Joseph, Robert Prosky and even Keye Luke returns. Lee is perfect as the wacky scientist and both Cates and Galligan are good even if their roles are fairly small.

Its about the lives of two men that get sentenced for life as well as having a slight hint on a moral grounds of the message of life! (Sorry, I couldn't help it). A decent movie made just before the sad and gradual decline of the two stars, Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence (with movies like Big Mommas Like Father Like Son and Norbit).The movie opens with two inmates burying the bodies of two deceased inmates and an elderly man in a wheelchair who claims to have known them for a long time. He then goes into a story about the lives of the deceased, and we are thrown into New York 1932. The movie is then told in a progression through time with the wheel chaired man giving an occasional narration.OK, so a quick rundown on the plot of the movie. Murphy plays a conman by the name of Rayford Gibson and Lawrence a professional man named Claude Banks (who will shortly start a job as a bank teller). Both men owe a mobster money. They get a chance to stay alive by doing a booze run in acquiring some moon shine from Mississippi. There they lose all their money and are accused of having killed a man. Charged with both this and bootlegging, the two are sentenced to life in prison. Across the 65 year sentence the two men constantly bicker, make and lose friends and figure out ways to escape from their dreary misfortune.The movie is directed by Ted Demme (Blow and Snitch), this was his second last movie. In short, the guy knew what he was doing. And kudos to him for this movie, I personally cannot find too much to complain about in this area, but if you guys do, lemme know.As for the acting itself, it is fairly decent but obviously not Oscar worthy. Murphy and Lawrence show great chemistry during this movie. Playing two absolute strangers who happen to become friends as they age to about 90 at the end of the movie. It is because they were originally strangers that the two are mainly bickering to each other throughout the movie, often using quips, threats and insults. This is where quite a lot of the comedy lies, with these remarks between each other and some of the other stars like Anthony Anderson, Bernie Mac, Guy Torry just to name a few.Another good performance is from Nick Cassavetes who plays the sergeant of the prison. Easily one can tell that his character is a racist with the way he treats the prisoners but the movie does well in making him more than two dimensional as his character actually changes through the movie.This movie also attempts to have some heart, which well, not like Shawshank Redemption, but it pulls it off in some places. Namely with the progression of the friendship of Ray and Claude, but with stories of some of the other characters and the hard life they have with their long sentences. The viewer may feel slight attachment or sympathy for these characters but these things are never lingered on for too long and so will quickly be forgotten.The movie also has subtle humour in some serious situations. Namely when Ray (Eddie Murphy's character) finds out nobody can read, so he reads a letter for an inmate. The letter reveals that practically everyone of his family has died, some from bizarre cases. When finished, Ray offers if anyone else wants a letter read and as one they say no and turn away.I could go on to complain that the make-up used to age the characters could have looked more convincing and so on but I know that wasn't really the movie's aim. So really, who cares?For a movie that is entertaining, in both being funny and slightly serious with a good ending, I truly think this movie is one for people to watch. Not saying you would think its the best thing out there, or that you should hunt it down like a piece of treasure.

Exactly how far you can go with time travel without repeating the plot of the first movie? Well, putting their efforts together, the two Bobs (Gale and Zemeckis) took a new trajectory with one parameter to take into account, the ending of the first movie and its iconic line Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads until the De Lorean flashes its way to 2015 before the eyes of a speechless Biff Tannen.And 2015 is the problem with movies set in the future, their chances of unfortunate miscalculations get higher as we approach the crucial year. As there was no mission to Jupiter 10 years ago, in 4 years, we know there would be no Hover Board, no flying cars, not even auto-adjusting shoes and auto-drying jackets ... but seriously, what would you have expected from a comedy? The interest of 2015 was less to discover a nightmarish dystopia nightmare a la Soylent Green than to REdiscover 'Hill Valley' REdesigned as a futuristic universe not supposed to be taken seriously &#x85; Zemeckis didn't expect to make a sequel, but considering the high popularity of the first opus, what was a just-for-laughs ending became the involuntary cliff-hanger to introduce the second film. Cars had to fly, and there had to be a mission in the future.And the first act set in the future might disappoint for this lack of nostalgia feel from the first film, and something maybe too forced or artificial. However, the script gets more interesting when we discover the future of the McFly, carrying much more serious undertones and I guess we accept the silly elements of the first act (Marty's kids looking like him, to name one) because the second and the third act kind of redeem it. I'll go even further by saying that the gap between the first act and the rest of the film is the only thing that prevented that one to be my favorite. This is the film that inspired my fascination for movies featuring time loops and the ripple effect, thanks to its terrific story about the exploitation of time travel, to have a second chance in life, like in the first film, but this time, for evil purposes. On that level, Back to the Future Part II exploits the great villainous potential of Biff Tannen, who deals with our heroes every time &#x85; literally, demonstrating the limits of time travels when handled by the wrong persons. Marty realizing that he can take advantage of this little trip in the future saves the Gray Sport's Almanach &#x85; for 'his' future, and from that very point (that needed to be exploited in a time-travel film) a destructive ripple effect would create a new chain of events and ultimately, the infamous alternate 1985. As soon as Marty and Doc get back in that 'new' reality, there's the extraordinary hellish feeling of a world belonging to Biff Tannen. Honorable mention for Thomas F. Wilson who deserves more praises as the third important character of the trilogy, if only for the priceless scene when an older and wiser Biff finally corrects his younger alter ego's verbal idiocy.The Alternate 1985 is the emotional highlight of the film allowing us to breathe and meditate on the real dangers of time travels. And the icing on the cake is yet to come. After all, this is a sequel, sure, but think of one thing, why wouldn't you use time travel to revisit the same period from a new perspective? Remember the first opus when Marty got back in 1985 and witnessed a second time the dramatic 'killing' and how mislead he was by his déjà vu appearance. In Part II, the climactic confrontation takes place in the same time than the first one, Marty has a feeling he went there the day before, the funny thing is that he meant it as a figure of speech. And for our greatest delight, we live the same scenes from the new Marty's perspective. And the thrilling part is when the characters get so close that the risk of a paradox aren't to be neglected, and the smartness of the script strikes again by using elements from the first movies as plot devices. What a pleasure to live again classic punch in Biff's face and the 'Johnny B. Goode' moment getting two times more classic. Back to the Future Part II is indeed one of the best sequels, because it obeys the very purpose of sequels, creating a feeling of deja vu with an original plot, making a film in the same vein as the first, if not with more heart, but with more gutsy creativity and the obligatory references that would become the trademarks of the trilogy, Mom is that you? Great Scott, the newcomer Chicken! revealing a new interesting facet in Marty's personality. And neither of the Bobs chickened out when at the end, they felt the movie still had some more potential, so instead of a convenient happy ending, as a flash of creativity, Doc aboard the DeLorean floating in the sky, is struck by lightning and disappears ... and one minute after, Marty receives a letter from a Western Union agent, a letter written by Dog 70 years before, and we realize that at that moment, we know the ropes of time travel, because we 'got' what happened.And what a better conclusion to re-watch the most iconic part of the trilogy when the DeLorean gets back to 1985 followed by the greatest cinematic cliff-hanger  a Marty McFly back FROM the future &#x85; ","genre":null},{"date":"4 October 2011","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Well, if it's not the best, this is certainly the most creatively wacky opus of the timeless time-classic trilogy &#x85; Back to the Future Part II has this particular merit that it takes the opportunity to make a sequel of a great classic and push its concept to the most extreme -yet scientifically acceptable- limit.

Exactly how far you can go with time travel without repeating the plot of the first movie? Well, putting their efforts together, the two Bobs (Gale and Zemeckis) took a new trajectory with one parameter to take into account, the ending of the first movie and its iconic line Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads until the De Lorean flashes its way to 2015 before the eyes of a speechless Biff Tannen.And 2015 is the problem with movies set in the future, their chances of unfortunate miscalculations get higher as we approach the crucial year. As there was no mission to Jupiter 10 years ago, in 4 years, we know there would be no Hover Board, no flying cars, not even auto-adjusting shoes and auto-drying jackets ... but seriously, what would you have expected from a comedy? The interest of 2015 was less to discover a nightmarish dystopia nightmare a la Soylent Green than to REdiscover 'Hill Valley' REdesigned as a futuristic universe not supposed to be taken seriously &#x85; Zemeckis didn't expect to make a sequel, but considering the high popularity of the first opus, what was a just-for-laughs ending became the involuntary cliff-hanger to introduce the second film. Cars had to fly, and there had to be a mission in the future.And the first act set in the future might disappoint for this lack of nostalgia feel from the first film, and something maybe too forced or artificial. However, the script gets more interesting when we discover the future of the McFly, carrying much more serious undertones and I guess we accept the silly elements of the first act (Marty's kids looking like him, to name one) because the second and the third act kind of redeem it. I'll go even further by saying that the gap between the first act and the rest of the film is the only thing that prevented that one to be my favorite. This is the film that inspired my fascination for movies featuring time loops and the ripple effect, thanks to its terrific story about the exploitation of time travel, to have a second chance in life, like in the first film, but this time, for evil purposes. On that level, Back to the Future Part II exploits the great villainous potential of Biff Tannen, who deals with our heroes every time &#x85; literally, demonstrating the limits of time travels when handled by the wrong persons. Marty realizing that he can take advantage of this little trip in the future saves the Gray Sport's Almanach &#x85; for 'his' future, and from that very point (that needed to be exploited in a time-travel film) a destructive ripple effect would create a new chain of events and ultimately, the infamous alternate 1985. As soon as Marty and Doc get back in that 'new' reality, there's the extraordinary hellish feeling of a world belonging to Biff Tannen. Honorable mention for Thomas F.

Failure to win Vietnam and the shame of Watergate prompted a reassessment of America. The moral certainties of old Hollywood were now irrelevant. In late 60's a new group of directors emerged to fill the vacuum. Their influences were other films. They were the movie brats. And the only one of them to achieve sustained unbroken success was Steven Spielberg. He is the most commercially successful filmmaker of all time, with an unerring instinct for the modern mainstream. He has converted his filmmaking powers to unprecedented corporate power in Hollywood. But while his commercial success is indisputable he has suffered much criticism; chiefly that his films are childish in their viewpoint. He positions himself in the cosy Middle-American ideological mainstream and presented issues in morally simplistic terms. His movies were full of sentimentality, moral certainties and special effects wizardry. He made Schindler's List partly with a view to address the accusation that he was not a serious filmmaker. But to be perfectly honest, whether you agree with this viewpoint or not the fact remains that Steven Spielberg directed Jaws. And that will be something that no one can ever take away from him. Jaws remains one of the most iconic, timeless, suspenseful and brilliant films ever made.It was nothing short of a cultural phenomenon on release. Not only in that it terrified a generation of people from going anywhere near the ocean but it had a profound and lasting effect on the movie industry. It was the biggest money maker of all time on release and it instigated a Hollywood production strategy that has been geared towards summer blockbusters ever since. It ushered in the era where marketing campaigns often cost more than the movie itself; while it was also the first film to be released via saturation booking, forever changing exhibition strategy. For better or for worse, Jaws changed the way the industry did business.But it would be enormously unfair to blame Jaws for the blockbuster phenomena. It was just by chance that this movie about a killer shark was the monumental success it was. In many ways this was a sister film to Spielberg's earlier movie Duel. Where that movie pitted an everyman against a malevolent truck driver, Jaws adopted the same basic idea but made the villain a great white shark. Jaws is essentially a horror movie because the creature in this film does not behave in the way any shark would. Here, the shark is given a malevolent evil intelligence that makes it behave in an almost supernatural way. It operates along the same lines as a maniac from a stalk and slash horror film. Moreover, the killing of the sexually liberated girl at the beginning of the film is very much in line with the conservative ethos of the slasher films that would follow in its wake. The price of immorality is evidently death in the universe of Jaws too.Spielberg manipulates the audience brilliantly by keeping the shark off the screen for a long time. Instead John Williams extraordinarily effective music is used to signify the presence of the monster. There are a series of scenes of incredible suspense where the fear of the unknown are played to the maximum, such as the opening killing and the attack on the two night fishermen. When the shark does finally appear it is nowhere near as rubbish looking as many claim. Despite being clearly fake you always believe in it. This is the power of Jaws.Spielberg's preoccupation with suburbia is very evident here. Amity is a small community put under siege by an alien enemy. This deadly foreign presence threatens this suburban idyll. Does Amity = America? Who can say for sure but there is no question about the parallels to Watergate in the town mayor's repeated attempt to cover up the scandal for his own self-interest. Political corruption was everywhere in 70's American movies, and here is no exception.Masculinity and class is represented in three types here. There is the abrasive and working class Quint, the intellectual and wealthy Hooper and the even-handed and middle class Brody. Despite their antagonistic relationship Quint and Hooper have much more in common with each other than with Brody. They share expertise despite the class divide. But seeing as this is the world according to Spielberg, narrative logic dictates that Brody - the man of the suburbs - will provide the sane middle ground that will ultimately prevail. His motivation is born of concern for the community, he is a family man with self-doubt; he does what he does out of a sense of duty not for selfish reasons. The everyman triumphs against evil.Jaws does crystallise the world view of Steven Spielberg. But where in some of his other films this perspective is coated with a saccharine feel, it is simply not the case here. Jaws is a thrilling film, with three dimensional characters. It terrified a generation of cinema-goers in the 70's and remains one of the genuinely great blockbusters. It never gets old.

Moreover, the killing of the sexually liberated girl at the beginning of the film is very much in line with the conservative ethos of the slasher films that would follow in its wake. The price of immorality is evidently death in the universe of Jaws too.Spielberg manipulates the audience brilliantly by keeping the shark off the screen for a long time. Instead John Williams extraordinarily effective music is used to signify the presence of the monster. There are a series of scenes of incredible suspense where the fear of the unknown are played to the maximum, such as the opening killing and the attack on the two night fishermen. When the shark does finally appear it is nowhere near as rubbish looking as many claim. Despite being clearly fake you always believe in it. This is the power of Jaws.Spielberg's preoccupation with suburbia is very evident here. Amity is a small community put under siege by an alien enemy. This deadly foreign presence threatens this suburban idyll. Does Amity = America? Who can say for sure but there is no question about the parallels to Watergate in the town mayor's repeated attempt to cover up the scandal for his own self-interest. Political corruption was everywhere in 70's American movies, and here is no exception.Masculinity and class is represented in three types here. There is the abrasive and working class Quint, the intellectual and wealthy Hooper and the even-handed and middle class Brody. Despite their antagonistic relationship Quint and Hooper have much more in common with each other than with Brody. They share expertise despite the class divide. But seeing as this is the world according to Spielberg, narrative logic dictates that Brody - the man of the suburbs - will provide the sane middle ground that will ultimately prevail. His motivation is born of concern for the community, he is a family man with self-doubt; he does what he does out of a sense of duty not for selfish reasons. The everyman triumphs against evil.Jaws does crystallise the world view of Steven Spielberg. But where in some of his other films this perspective is coated with a saccharine feel, it is simply not the case here. Jaws is a thrilling film, with three dimensional characters. It terrified a generation of cinema-goers in the 70's and remains one of the genuinely great blockbusters. It never gets old. ","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"4 October 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The 1970s was a transitional period for Hollywood and American society. Failure to win Vietnam and the shame of Watergate prompted a reassessment of America. The moral certainties of old Hollywood were now irrelevant. In late 60's a new group of directors emerged to fill the vacuum. Their influences were other films. They were the movie brats. And the only one of them to achieve sustained unbroken success was Steven Spielberg. He is the most commercially successful filmmaker of all time, with an unerring instinct for the modern mainstream. He has converted his filmmaking powers to unprecedented corporate power in Hollywood. But while his commercial success is indisputable he has suffered much criticism; chiefly that his films are childish in their viewpoint. He positions himself in the cosy Middle-American ideological mainstream and presented issues in morally simplistic terms. His movies were full of sentimentality, moral certainties and special effects wizardry. He made Schindler's List partly with a view to address the accusation that he was not a serious filmmaker. But to be perfectly honest, whether you agree with this viewpoint or not the fact remains that Steven Spielberg directed Jaws. And that will be something that no one can ever take away from him. Jaws remains one of the most iconic, timeless, suspenseful and brilliant films ever made.It was nothing short of a cultural phenomenon on release. Not only in that it terrified a generation of people from going anywhere near the ocean but it had a profound and lasting effect on the movie industry. It was the biggest money maker of all time on release and it instigated a Hollywood production strategy that has been geared towards summer blockbusters ever since. It ushered in the era where marketing campaigns often cost more than the movie itself; while it was also the first film to be released via saturation booking, forever changing exhibition strategy. For better or for worse, Jaws changed the way the industry did business.But it would be enormously unfair to blame Jaws for the blockbuster phenomena. It was just by chance that this movie about a killer shark was the monumental success it was. In many ways this was a sister film to Spielberg's earlier movie Duel. Where that movie pitted an everyman against a malevolent truck driver, Jaws adopted the same basic idea but made the villain a great white shark. Jaws is essentially a horror movie because the creature in this film does not behave in the way any shark would. Here, the shark is given a malevolent evil intelligence that makes it behave in an almost supernatural way. It operates along the same lines as a maniac from a stalk and slash horror film.

Idle and fatigued, he seeks more life and from the aid of a psychologist he decides to go on hiatus from money for 12 months.Of course, in a way, this is a good allegory. Life is worth more then money. It may be a platitude but we get the essence of this from the help that Bliss bestows - he gets a business funded for Frances. In conflict with Clare and that (an unmitigated insignificant subplot), the idea behind Blisses assessment of love is somewhat superficial until the end I feel. At one point he utters Love is more then Money, which the psychologist finds insane. A little hypocritical? Trying to put him adrift in another path, yet still uncertain about how it works? I don't know.Though I do know that is Grant that holds up the foundation of the film in the enjoyment department, especially in the scene where two people find out he's that mogul, and they have a slapstick fight in the house.The film is limited in location shots, albeit it also uses cheap segues and effects.

Hitchcock has said in print that this film is really about a woman's fantasy life and when looked at from that perspective it is brilliantly executed directorially and by all the actors, especially Joan Fontaine, and it doesn't really quite matter how it ends. Since he doesn't kill her, her fantasy is all paranoia and in the next reel she should probably go seek a good therapist. If he had killed her, the illusion would have been all about her immature and overwhelming love for her husband and the inability to leave him because of her all consuming, fantasy driven obsession with him. I have watched this film over and over and over and never tire of it and I have to say it is Joan Fontaine's performance that keeps the interest going. Grant is wonderful as always but she is the focal point and she never fails to deliver the goods. This is GREAT Hitchcock and I know people tend to overlook Fontaine and give great praise to Ingrid Bergman, especially in Notorious, which is a great film, yet I prefer Fontaine over Bergman and Suspicion over Notorious. The psychology of this film is sooooo compelling and the story and narrative so simple and tight that repeat viewings always reveal something new to discover as any great work of art should.

The fifth film in the Friday the 13th series, plot follows on from part 4 and finds Jason Vorhees' young killer Tommy Jarvis (Shepherd) now as a troubled young man. After spending years moving from various institutions, Tommy's latest home is the Pinehurst Youth Development Center, and pretty soon after his arrival it appears that Vorhees has risen from the grave and is killing everyone in the vicinity....Well it ultimately wasn't a new beginning in the context of the franchise, but it is a different Friday picture. With a fresh idea at its core, and carrying a genuine mystery element, there was a boldness lurking somewhere amongst the brains trust behind the picture. However, these nifty ideas are undercut by insipid direction, bad acting and a blatant attempt to be crude and mean spirited. It isn't hard to figure out that director Steinmann was once a pornography director, for the film plays out as a series of nudity for nudes sake sequences, engulfed by a meaty killing every other five minutes. You can only have so much of each before it gets boring, and A New Beginning gets boring very quickly. Thus making the only reason to stay with the picture is to learn the big reveal of the new hockey mask wearing lunatic. It may be enough for undemanding horny horror fans, but it's an undeniably lazy picture.Still, there's a little comfort in that the makers added some twists, and the film, if you can look around the breasts and meat cleaver, actually has some of the best colour photography in the franchise so far.

Serious by comic book movie standards anyway. There was darkness and gloominess in that first film which Burton used to great effect. In Batman Returns Burton upped the ante on the darkness. He went really dark. I mean really, really dark. Way too dark for his movie's good. One can imagine thousands of happy young tykes bouncing into the theater excited to see a Batman movie only to come out two hours later crying their eyes out and headed for an appointment with a child psychologist. Fun for the whole family? Not this movie. This is more horror film than superhero saga. I guess when a movie begins with parents tossing their infant child into a river you can forget about it being a feel-good story. And when that child floats into a sewer and is rescued by penguins we know who our villain's going to be this time around.So it's Penguin. And Burton's concept for this character sinks the movie. What a vile, disgusting creature. A sick, twisted, perverted little man whose diabolical plans, when finally revealed, are almost too awful to comprehend. It's the stuff of nightmares. If Burton was looking to frighten a whole generation of kids he probably succeeded. If he was looking to make a good movie he failed. The Penguin is a depraved character who makes the movie way scarier than any mass-audience comic book movie should be. And aside from the scares parents will probably want to be covering their children's eyes and ears with all the upfront sexual innuendo in the movie. Mommy, what's poontang? This is a Batman movie for crying out loud, you know kids are going to swarm to see it. But Burton made a movie with very grownup sensibilities. OK, so maybe it's too adult, maybe it's not what you really expect a Batman movie to be. But putting that aside there's still the fact that it's simply a bad movie.You feel bad for Danny DeVito who, in playing Penguin, was given a character who wasn't salvageable. Penguin's not the only villain though. There are a couple more and they largely fail too. Michelle Pfeiffer plays Selina Kyle who is of course destined to become Catwoman. How exactly does Selina become Catwoman? Quite ludicrously. Pfeiffer makes the most of what she's got to work with. Catwoman's got her moments which is more than you can say for Penguin who is an off-putting, grotesque abomination from start to finish. Then there's powerful, corrupt Gotham businessman Max Shreck. The best thing that you can say about this character is that he's played by Christopher Walken, who always brings his own unique touch to any film. But Shreck's not particularly interesting, has no backstory to give us a reason to care about him, and he disappears for large portions of the film. Three villains in this case don't add up to much. And oh by the way Michael Keaton's Batman again. Keaton was largely overshadowed by Jack Nicholson's Joker in the first film. But, both as Batman and perhaps more crucially as Bruce Wayne, Keaton contributed a great deal to the first film. Here he really doesn't get a chance to do much of anything at all. Neither Batman nor Bruce ever are really able to grab hold of this movie. It's a dark, gloomy tale of the bad guys, the Penguin in particular. And where Nicholson's Joker infused the first film with so much energy the Penguin sucks the life out of this film. There's very little to enjoy here. Is it so much to ask to have a little fun in a comic book movie? No fun here, just gloom and doom and a movie which really disappoints.

Fun for the whole family? Not this movie. This is more horror film than superhero saga. I guess when a movie begins with parents tossing their infant child into a river you can forget about it being a feel-good story. And when that child floats into a sewer and is rescued by penguins we know who our villain's going to be this time around.So it's Penguin. And Burton's concept for this character sinks the movie. What a vile, disgusting creature. A sick, twisted, perverted little man whose diabolical plans, when finally revealed, are almost too awful to comprehend. It's the stuff of nightmares. If Burton was looking to frighten a whole generation of kids he probably succeeded. If he was looking to make a good movie he failed. The Penguin is a depraved character who makes the movie way scarier than any mass-audience comic book movie should be. And aside from the scares parents will probably want to be covering their children's eyes and ears with all the upfront sexual innuendo in the movie. Mommy, what's poontang? This is a Batman movie for crying out loud, you know kids are going to swarm to see it. But Burton made a movie with very grownup sensibilities. OK, so maybe it's too adult, maybe it's not what you really expect a Batman movie to be. But putting that aside there's still the fact that it's simply a bad movie.You feel bad for Danny DeVito who, in playing Penguin, was given a character who wasn't salvageable. Penguin's not the only villain though. There are a couple more and they largely fail too. Michelle Pfeiffer plays Selina Kyle who is of course destined to become Catwoman. How exactly does Selina become Catwoman? Quite ludicrously. Pfeiffer makes the most of what she's got to work with. Catwoman's got her moments which is more than you can say for Penguin who is an off-putting, grotesque abomination from start to finish. Then there's powerful, corrupt Gotham businessman Max Shreck. The best thing that you can say about this character is that he's played by Christopher Walken, who always brings his own unique touch to any film. But Shreck's not particularly interesting, has no backstory to give us a reason to care about him, and he disappears for large portions of the film. Three villains in this case don't add up to much. And oh by the way Michael Keaton's Batman again. Keaton was largely overshadowed by Jack Nicholson's Joker in the first film. But, both as Batman and perhaps more crucially as Bruce Wayne, Keaton contributed a great deal to the first film. Here he really doesn't get a chance to do much of anything at all. Neither Batman nor Bruce ever are really able to grab hold of this movie. It's a dark, gloomy tale of the bad guys, the Penguin in particular. And where Nicholson's Joker infused the first film with so much energy the Penguin sucks the life out of this film. There's very little to enjoy here.

It's a 1938 vintage, and one of the first colour movies. But what colour! Flynn was one of those special actors who really did deserve the term 'star'. His unique blend of athletic action, debonair personality and chivalrous behaviour effectively defined swashbuckling. There was, and never has been, an adequate competitor or replacement. He was the Daddy. Slim, lithe, rather effete by today's standards of champion, his nearest comparison today would be Johnny Depp. How sad and inadequate is that? Just watch the flexibility of Flynn's expression, between passion, humour and fury, and check-out the vigorous sword fights.Basil Rathbone and Claude Raines play the unscrupulous, conniving villains. Olivier deHavilland is the comely Maid Marion. Sets are solid and believable. Locations fit the piece, lighting, editing and sundry technical issues each hit the spot. All the memorable elements of the legend are here - the battle with Little John on the bridge, piggy-backing across the river by Friar Tuck, feasts in the forest, the archery tournament etc.This movie is such a fun-filled romp it's like a musical with the songs omitted. But it's got plenty of tension, too, and a decent script that's well worth hearing. Korngold's anthems and pompous fanfares perfectly suit each scene, though once or twice I find them a little heavy on the eardrums. And modern viewers may find the thigh-slapping bonhomie slightly camp. The restored double DVD contains more 'extra' than you can shake a quarterstaff at.

Then it will be presented its food for consumption, and it will start up its filters in order to judge whether the food is good or bad. And every time you think you can fit it with a negative label, you will gladly make known that you made that recognition.In the other way, you enter the movie fully and openly, without expectations. And as the experience unfolds, you feel into the characters and relate it to your own being.From the first perspective, this movie is not very good. It's slow, a bit airy-fairy, and the plot quite boring. Your mind will probably already know what's going to happen all the time, and find plenty of negative labels it can paste onto the movie. On to the next one, the next thing to consume, it will tell you.From the other perspective, this is one of the best movies if not the best ever created in the history of humanity, if you ask me. It gradually unfolds into showing how R. Junuh (Matt Damon) becomes more present in where he is, as he makes crucial steps in his mind and lets go of the baggage that remains inside of it. By following this process and relating to it ourselves, this movie is a wonderful tool for becoming more present and being masterful in whatever we happen to be doing in our own lives.Bagger Vance (Will Smith) basically tells that the only thing that Junuh can do in order to win this game of golf is let go of his thoughts. The thoughts that tell him who he is or should be in relation to others, what he feels about the present 'situation', or what he needs to do in order to succeed. He learns that he needs to simply drop that self-centeredness, essentially that whining child inside, and let the moment that is already there take him over instead of his mind.By doing so ourselves during the movie, we might become more present too as our thoughts fade to the background and as we become more aware of what's going on around us, instead of being absorbed only in what's going on inside the screen, behind the electronic window. We can get into that state where we feel our environment, where we drop all mental baggage, and where we can simply excel in what we do, whatever it is that apparently wants to be done through us. We can remember how it was before all the mental conditioning started somewhere in our childhood, and become present again. That's the real potential of this movie, the experience it can drag you into. Which is much better than a temporary pleasure, if you ask me.And is that not the only thing to do in this game we call life? Is that not the ultimate teaching that the Bhagavad Gita and ultimately the mystical branches of all religions point to? In this movie, it's not Bagger Vance that awakens R. Junuh, it simply all happens pretty much independently of anything, in the true experiential recognition of itself. And that's really all we need to know, and the limit of all that we can really get from any type of immersion in media content.
