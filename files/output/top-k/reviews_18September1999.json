[{"date":"18 September 1999","score":"","review":"  Although many of the Hollywood films have a very American feel to it, For Love of the Game practically defines the United States. This movie shows almost every aspect of the American culture and their obsession with sports but beneath this baseball exterior is a movie about how an individual deals with change.The story revolves around Billy Chapal (Kevin Costner). Billy is the star pitcher for the Detroit Tigers and has spent his entire career with the team. We meet Billy late in his long but distinguished career and it seems that time has finally caught up with him. His body is starting to show signs of age and in the final game of the year against the New York Yankies, circumstances dictate that he must decide whether he wants to continue to play (possibly on another team) or retire. Throughout this final game, the movie flashes back to snippets of his life revolving around his career, friends and a woman named Jane (Kelly Preston). Jane is a woman that Billy meets 5 years prior to this time and these flash backs show the relationship between the two of them and the role that baseball plays in Billy's life.This is possibly one of Kevin Costner's best performances. Although he has done many different roles, baseball seems to be one that he's most comfortable in. This is his third baseball movie and I have to say that I found this one to be his best. In many of Costner's movies, I have always found that he sometimes has a very unemotional or stoney performance but this is not the case with this movie. In many instances, I found his display of emotions very true and on occasions you get a lump in your throat. Kelly Preston is exceptional in this movie as Chapal's girlfriend and we definitely see chemistry between the two actors. This movie is not only about Chapal's life. There is enough development by the director to give insight into Preston's character and her life that you feel what she feels. The peripheral actors also give very good performances, especially John Reilly who plays the Tigers' catcher and Chapal's best friend.The one drawback to this movie is that it does feel long. It's approximately 2.5 hours but it feels more like 3 hours. There were also instances that I think some scenes were cutout. The trailers and commercials show some scenes that weren't in the movie that I thought would have been more appropriate.This is a very good movie, even if you're not a baseball fan, which being from Canada, I'm not but nonetheless I liked it. There is much more going on than baseball and the director uses some beautiful images as symbolism. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone....9\/10.

The film is everything that you'll never want to watch. The scenes are disturbing, gut wrenching, mind twisting, and way over the top. In result, A  Clockwork Orange has the most powerful and overwhelming dramatic impact that I have ever experienced in a mainstream film. \tA Clockwork Orange is the story of a young man named Alex DeLarge, who is, by day, a regular student who lives with his parents at home, but, by night, a homicidal rapist\/killer with his accomplices who dress up like demented clowns at a bleak freak show. He and his buddies weasel their way into the happy homes housing innocent people by chanting the same deceiving phrase every night they scream that their friend has been critically wounded in an accident near by--and plead to use their telephone to call for help.For a few unfortunate souls, this devious trick proves to be successful in nature. One night, however, a woman known as The Cat Lady, refuses their plead, and calls the police in suspicion. Alex, being both smart and sneaky, somehow manages to break into this perverted woman's home, while his accomplices wait outside. Once indoors, a fight begins. A struggle featuring a sex toy owned by Cat Lady, one that not only causes panicked arousal, but also is featured as the weapon of her graphic and disturbing murder. Alex quickly flees the scene once the police sirens reach his shaky ears, but when he gets back to his pal's waiting outside, they return their experiences with him by bashing him over the head with a hard object, allowing their jumbled escape, but his certain demise.After the process of being sent to prison, Alex grows to learn to tell offices and guards what they like to hear. He reads the bible, is never involved with any major fights or complications, and almost volunteers for a new kind of experiment. An experiment so probationary it is still being tested and held under wraps. What it does, though a series of sessions, is cure a violent individual from his sickness; he will feel terrible pain if involved in any sort of violence after the medicine takes place.The scenes involving the cure of Alex's disturbances are truly emotionally troublesome. They are so explicit and detailed that I myself felt tempted to look away from the screen at points. This is not a film for those who are prone to walk out of movies, those who are easily offended, or especially for those with week stomachs. This is the most grizzly enumerated film I have even screened, but it happens to be one of the most perfect and precise in message.  I definitely don't recommend the production to everyone, though. The soundtrack to A Clockwork Orange is one of the most inspirational and spirited ones I have ever heard; right up there with the turns to The Graduate (1967). Although the actual music is far from fitting each individual scene, the overall presence is not only worth listening to, but also worth the purchase price.Here, a young Malcolm McDowell explores the character of a lifetime with vivid imagination and tremendous description. His character fits him very well as an actor. Even though the character is meant to be despised, I couldn't help but to be very convinced and interested in his sick, demented, psychotic mind. Most of this is because of the flawless point of view the film contains, one that both provokes empathy and involvement. It investigates the mind of a killer, rapist, and a confused, somewhat harmless, adolescent--all existing in the same character. This is no doubt the character, and the performance, that inspired a generation.As well as being a movie of violent and sexual repulsion, Stanley Kubrick's direction to A Clockwork Orange also forces us to investigate deep down in ourselves and chew on the idea of us being in the character's shoes. There is a scene in this movie that forces two parents to make a decision of a lifetime. After receiving the treatments he volunteered for, Alex returns to his household only to discover that the only mom and dad he's even known have rented his old room out to some strange college kid, who is said to have been there for them during many hard times--like a real son. His parents must make a choice to throw their only son, who has suffered for years in turn for making others suffer, out of the house for good, or allow him to return with open arms trusting that he is cured.

And I think it was defineately worth buying, for several reasons itIt isn't a brilliant movie, but it is good. Some of the effects of the worms were great (but nothing like what can be done today) and others completely sucked (the Guild Navigator, when he was folding space, was the worst) But specialfx don't make a movie, even though most people my age, that I know, hate old movies cause of the effects (This movie was made the year I was born.)Most of the parts were well cast, and I thought Brad Dourif was perfect as Piter De Vries, although having watched Patrick Stewart as Picard for seven years, I couldn't see him as Guerney Halleck.The sets were amazing, as were the desert shots, and the music is the best soundtrack I have ever heard for a movie.(Seriously, you should watch it just for the music)So all in all a good movie, but there are a few bad points.

So why is this one of the lamest films of all time?  Why was this material, suitable for a small theatrical or club venue or maybe even a TV special, feted royally with a huge Broadway production and this subsequent feature film?  The answer can only be (sorry to say) that the painful reality of the C word intimidated everyone who encountered it.  Nobody could bear to say No! to Sweeney - let alone Ha!After the Broadway production bombed in a few short performances, why didn't anyone reconsider this ill-conceived movie?  Although Sweeney is a sweet and endearing presence, her talents are stretched to the breaking point here.  Her considered insights into her experiences are far from revelatory and her overall shaping of this long monologue is uneven at best.  Sweeney (whose previous film IT'S PAT was based on a Saturday Night Live sketch considered the new HEAVEN'S GATE)is just not up to carrying a full length one-woman feature on her own. That reluctantly said, the direction and design of this film is where the pic is at it's most banal.  A cheesy off-Broadway set is clearly a left-over from her stage presentation and isn't needed or utilized to any advantage.  In fact, it distracts more often than not.Direction (of Sweeney and the cameras) is non-existent and an idiotic laugh track feels like it was dubbed in as an after-thought.  Even the canned audience sounds afraid to laugh to heartily at the delicate subject matter.  No matter, however, because we never see the audience - we only hear their tentative and distant titters. One meager camera move involves panning behind another camera!  What is this supposed to prove?  It only reminds us that we are watching a film and takes us momentarily away from Sweeney's moving story.

As proof positive that (in lieu of no direction) simple is best, Sweeney is at her most powerful and poignant when looking directly into the camera - which, unfortunately, she rarely does.

The problem is, it is very, very difficult to sustain a satire over an entire movie (although Kubrick did it in Dr. Strangelove); things can get especially confused if you try to make the satire into a morality tale with a pleasant ending, as Director Gary Ross does here. He knows that life is too complex for easy answers, and that seemed to be one of the things he was trying to say, e.g., monogamy is not necessarily superior to, or inferior to, adultery. Ditto for chastity and fornication. Rain for a change is nice.But he got confused somewhere along the way and ended up with a smug, sappy movie with ideas as shallow and black and white as the 50s milieu he was trying to satirize. The feel good ending is beyond redemption, in its way even sappier than the mythical sit-com it tries to improve upon. Yes, it is kind of neat to see things turn from black and white to color accompanied by stirring orchestral strings, especially as a result of something-like socking a bad guy in the jaw-that pleases one's prejudices. But where are the shades of gray? Not all red is fire engine red nor all blue, baby blue.Reese Witherspoon plays a skanky teen (Jennifer) who teaches (as Mary Sue) the Pleasantvillians to fornicate (and her TV mom to masturbate) while she learns that reading is worthwhile. Tobey Maguire plays her brother David\/Bud who begins as a nerd, but ends up heroic, attractive to the opposite sex, and wise beyond his years. (Yes, and we live in the best of all possible worlds.) Strange how this movie manages to satirize itself.Joan Allen is grim as the stay-at-home sit-com housewife, and William H. Macy is appropriately bland as her simpleminded husband. Jeff Daniels as the soda jerk\/artiste-and her unlikely lover-is tolerable.Through the film meanders a kind of confused extract of the Biblical story of the Garden of Eden. In the Bible, eating the fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil forever removed humans from paradise. In Pleasantville, knowledge of anything outside of town or of anything unpleasant has the same effect, while bestowing wondrous color. We even have a very red apple presented to Bud by his TV girl friend Margaret (played with wholesome sexiness by pretty Marley Shelton).What began to wear on me was the easy choice of target. Going after fifties-style prudery and conformity is like shooting fish in a barrel. I should add here that human desire is infinite too much is never enough. So perhaps it is better to start modestly with a soda at the soda fountain holding hands (the 50s style made fun of in the film) instead of immediately coupling below the dashboard with legs in the air (90s spin on same, lauded in the film).Gary Ross, for your next flick, how about taking aim at today's violent, mercenary, duplicitous society?

Those who look for gore, though, shouldn't worry the film is even more yucky than the original.
