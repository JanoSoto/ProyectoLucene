There are some interesting moments, but this exercise in existentialism just seems too out of place for a WWII setting. Trust me... everyone fighting in that war knew why they were fighting it, and they all knew the stakes. The Korean War or Vietnam would be better settings for the introspective wonder Malick tries to throw at us here.There are too many characters to spend time on here, but a few stand out in this whimsical account of the US invasion of Guadal Canal. Jim Caviezel as Private Witt seems to be the main focus of the story. He is a dreamy soldier who apparently has a habit of going AWOL on his unit. We first see him living amongst a village of native Polynesians before being picked up by a patrol and brought back to the army. He is amazed at the lack of hostility he sees in these natives, even pointing out to the adults how even the kids there didn't seem to fight amongst themselves. By now, most casual movie fans are asking themselves, when the hell are we going to get some war carnage? Spielberg didn't make us wait long at all in Saving Private Ryan! Eventually we do get some battle action, but it isn't nearly as graphic or explosive as what many expect. Most of it focuses on following orders and whether or not an advancement against a well dug in enemy is worth the lives it will cost. During these scenes, we are treated to the film's best performance by Nick Nolte as an aging colonel desperate for a big win and a promotion to general. Nolte was still at the top of his game back then, and he chews the scenery to bits. He may even inspire you. This was before the flowered shirt mug shot debacle that his career has never recovered from.The film is pretty much stillborn whenever Nolte is off screen, though. Just too many cameos to keep track of, and some of them (Travolta) are downright embarrassing. How does an actor as good as Sean Penn become an afterthought? He had plenty of screen time, yet he never found his character. Malick's style never really lends itself to its characters, though. Nature is usually what stands out. Here the cinematography is fine, but how could it not have been? Few shots really stand out. The battle scenes are not blocked particularly well. This is common when you have a director not specializing in action. And to top it off, the movie is just dull. You won't care about these characters, and you won't really want to hear what they care about, either. All viewers, casual and serious, should be advised to avoid this film.

He has the bad-ass attitude of Clint Eastwood. Well, he only cares about his own law. He believes his country has taken everything away from him, but his patriotism is still intact because in his opinion, government is absolute crap and corruption.This is what I would call John Carpenter's urban masterpiece. We find action and more action through black humor, suspense, and a dynamic direction. The social criticism by John Carpenter shows us a fascist politic and a government that is more worried in reprehending rather than readapting. In this New York everything gets solved through mafias and corruption through a setting of illegality. But to be honest, only action matters! This is a cult film in all of it's glory. We get memorable characters. Snake is a historical nowadays because of his attitude, his violent moods, his cool dialogs, and the way that he doesn't cares about anything. Snake doesn't like anyone. This is possible through Kurt Russell's excellent acting. Other characters like Cabbie (played by the great Ernest Borgnine), Brain (the always functional Harry Dean Stanton), Maggie (the sexy Adrienne Barbue, whose cleave makes men drool), Hauk (superbly played by Lee Van Cleef), the mythical Tom Atkins (in a secondary role), and the weird and spooky Romero played by a guy who would later inspire Evil Ed in Fright Night (in my opinion). Donald Pleasence delivers some good black humor and cool action sequences.Special mention for the late Isaac Hayes who gives life to The Duke. His part is absolutely memorable. And generates one of the most bad-ass introductions ever in cinema.The fact that I cared about all the characters made me hate the scrip writers who doesn't know a thing about the meaning of a team. They all get offed in bad fashion and very quick.Carpenter's Direction is explosive. I mean, at any point you forget you are watching an action film even though the master applies his unique style (inspired by Horror) in such scenes like the living dead that come out of the sewers, the freak Romero character, and the tension that he could only create. A solid work.The atmosphere of the city was great. Every single detail was perfectly taken care of. It is a world that you would like to enter and explore like a sandbox freely. The setting looks perfect for a video game. Although I think the settings could be more explored.The violence is adequate and in excess. The Greek-roman fight was not that impressive, just blah. The escape in the bridge could've delivered more explosions and blood. We still get stabbings, wounds caused by shot guns, and kick-ass explosions.We should not forget that this is a B-Movie. Because of that, it looks ridiculous in some moments. For example, in the clothing, editing, scenarios, dialogs. But those elements give it a Sui generis style. Yes, even because of that, it's still better that many actual action movies.The soundtrack is so 80's it will make you smile. Great rhythm. And, did it make you think about Halloween at some point? Yes, of course.The Cinematography and Art Direction give it a touch of mysticism and surrealism. It looks classy at it's own way. I mean, a visually sinister world, dark, but stylish and detailed.

I think this is due to the fact that this movie never manages to find its right balance. At times the movie is being adventurous, at other comical or action-like, or romantic. But its never really fully one thing. The movie changes style a lot, even with its own comedy. At times it's a screwball, while at others its being more of a modern type of comedy. Perhaps this is due to the fact that this movie got made in 1951, when the screwball type of comedies weren't really around anymore and movies tried to find a new, more modern, type of comedy, for the new modern audience. When watching this movie you really have the feeling it could had been a great one, if it had made a choice at what it truly wanted to be. If it had been a screwball comedy the movie would probably had ended up being an hilarious one, if it had been more an adventurous movie, lets say Indiana Jones style, this movie would had been truly fun. Now it's just a bit of everything, without ever forming one great, successful, big whole. It's the reason why the movie still feels a bit clumsy and definitely flawed.But nevertheless, there of course is still plenty of fun in this movie. It's a good movie to watch to be entertained by, just don't expect to be blown away by any cleverness or originality, or even greatness for all that matter.It has the right concept and story for this type of movie. Basically movies like this are still being around today, in which two people, who don't even like each other at first, due to circumstances end up together and start to grow toward each other. A classic movie set up, which makes it perhaps also strange that this movie hasn't got remade yet. I'm not counting the 1977 version with the same title, since its being more of a sequel and was supposed to be a pilot for a TV-series that got picked up by any studios.Because the movie got shot in the early '50's but in full color, the movie has a sort of cheap look over it, even though this at the time was a very expensive movie to shoot. It's just one of those movies that would probably had been better off being shot in black & white. Besides, Humphrey Bogart never looked at his best in color. It was both for him and Katharine Hepburn the first time they appeared in a Technicolor film. It will also be remembered as the movie that earned Humphrey Bogart his first and only Oscar. Totally ridicules of course, since he had played so many, much better roles throughout his career. But at least he still won an Oscar during his career. Not every great actor out of cinematic history can say that very same.But before I'm sounding too negative I should say that you probably won't regret watching this movie. It's a fun classic, that however could had been much, much better.7\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"17 July 2010","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a bit of a clumsy and flawed movie but it's all good enough and fun to watch.At times this movie is just great, while at others it just isn't.

It's just one of those movies that would probably had been better off being shot in black & white. Besides, Humphrey Bogart never looked at his best in color. It was both for him and Katharine Hepburn the first time they appeared in a Technicolor film. It will also be remembered as the movie that earned Humphrey Bogart his first and only Oscar. Totally ridicules of course, since he had played so many, much better roles throughout his career. But at least he still won an Oscar during his career. Not every great actor out of cinematic history can say that very same.But before I'm sounding too negative I should say that you probably won't regret watching this movie.

I think this is due to the fact that this movie never manages to find its right balance. At times the movie is being adventurous, at other comical or action-like, or romantic. But its never really fully one thing. The movie changes style a lot, even with its own comedy. At times it's a screwball, while at others its being more of a modern type of comedy. Perhaps this is due to the fact that this movie got made in 1951, when the screwball type of comedies weren't really around anymore and movies tried to find a new, more modern, type of comedy, for the new modern audience. When watching this movie you really have the feeling it could had been a great one, if it had made a choice at what it truly wanted to be. If it had been a screwball comedy the movie would probably had ended up being an hilarious one, if it had been more an adventurous movie, lets say Indiana Jones style, this movie would had been truly fun. Now it's just a bit of everything, without ever forming one great, successful, big whole. It's the reason why the movie still feels a bit clumsy and definitely flawed.But nevertheless, there of course is still plenty of fun in this movie. It's a good movie to watch to be entertained by, just don't expect to be blown away by any cleverness or originality, or even greatness for all that matter.It has the right concept and story for this type of movie. Basically movies like this are still being around today, in which two people, who don't even like each other at first, due to circumstances end up together and start to grow toward each other.

Film enthusiasts must be grateful that Boorman sought the opportunity to film the Arthurian legends instead. Although never accurately dated, these relate to the period immediately following the withdrawal of Roman forces from Britain in the first half of the fifth century. In AD 379 Christianity had became the official Roman religion and these legends have it that Arthur battled to preserve both Christianity and Roman civilization from Barbarian invaders. Although his name is found in some Roman records, there is no record of his exact status, or even any convincing proof that he ever lived. Despite prolific legends, other written records all date from a much later period so historians still put them in the unproven category. Clearly all the written accounts of battles between armies of knights in the type of shining armour only developed in the twelfth century must date from this period or later and, if not fictional, can only be reporting verbal traditions. This situation is similar to that with Troy, which, until archaeologists finally unearthed the remains of the city, was long regarded as a legend to be found only in the pages of Homer's Illiad. There have been many attempts to unearth remains proving the Arthurian legends in this way, but to date nothing totally convincing has been found. Many feel that such a mass of detailed stories is unlikely to have arisen without any foundation, but as with Troy this would not confirm the individual tales which have been passed down for so many centuries. We may never know whether Achilles or Hector really existed but even if this is one day proved we will still not accept the legends linking them to the immortals of Mount Olympus. Similarly with Arthur, archaeological discoveries confirming his participation in some of his legendary battles would not even prove that he was a legitimately crowned monarch, let alone support the stories of magical interventions on his behalf by Merlin. .Historically, Arthur is a Celtic hero and these legends appear to have emanated from the Celtic refuges in Cornwall, Wales and Brittany. This might point to a slightly later historical period when the Celts had been driven far to the west by the invading Saxons. But the legends speak of Arthur's conquests, at their peak, extending over most of Britain and parts of both France and Scandinavia so it is equally easy to understand why oral legends of past greatness would have become increasingly important a few centuries later when his people had been forced into a smaller and less hospitable area. Early written records come mainly from Wales where Geoffrey of Monmouth incorporated many of the legends into a history of the Celtic kings. These and other similar works were used by Sir Thomas Malory to create his major work -Le Morte d'Arthur, printed by Caxton in 1485. Prepared as eight books covering the entire life of Arthur, this was perhaps the most important work he printed. An excellent summary of the contents of each book can be found on line in Wikipedia. Four hundred years later Tennyson, using considerable poetic licence, converted them into the soaring blank verse of Idylls of the King which so naturally complemented Victorian concepts of Christian morality. John Boorman clearly knew and loved the works of both Malory and Tennyson. Perhaps more important this was also true of his scriptwriter Rosco Pallenberg. For them, history was uncertain, this was to be the film of a legend; and I believe they produced the most atmospheric film of legends almost lost in the mists of time ever to have been created, a film which deserves a place in any list of the hundred best films.But both critics and the public have been split on this. This is one of the films that is either loved or hated. The problem I think was that many who saw it were expecting a fictional reconstruction of the life of the great King Arthur. This could make a good film but it should be called King Arthur, not Excalibur; and it was not Boorman's film. He did what he set out to do incredibly brilliantly and I find it hard to criticise his great work. However, disappointed with its reception, he is now in the process of filming it again with an IMDb expected release date of 2012. Boorman is a director capable of creating an even more outstanding film, but because re-makes have a history of so often falling short of the original I am writing these comments now to urge fellow film lovers to buy the DVD of the existing film before it is withdrawn and becomes a very elusive masterpiece to track down.

","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"},{"date":"17 July 2010","score":"","review":" Dog Day Afternoon begins with a montage presented to us in a relatively upbeat fashion, a going over and presenting of tidbits of New York-set summer iconography as people enjoy tennis matches; time on a beach and young lovers' company with one another. The music is uplifting and upbeat, the weather warm and welcoming as various people of whom have dressed down to coincide with the climate totter about the streets and parks. The soundtrack is meaningfully toned down when we come to focus on the American flag, itself being lowered from a pole, before cutting to a car housing some shifty looking individuals outside a bank the iconographic, or 'romantisised', view of the city comes to a bit of crashing halt as we zone in on a new band of youths of whom do not conform to the various groups of kids and youths most certainly on display in the 'outsider' montage. The flag's physical lowering is systematic with the film's own lowering into a part of New York the tourists don't see, and their clicking off of the radio thus killing the song we were actually hearing, is the ultimate act that confirms both their and this New York existence's presence.Dog Day Afternoon has this attitude towards New York and its inhabitants, keeping a distanced perspective of more typical New York City imagery and instead focusing on those inhabiting the undergrowth within; those with issues, problems, flaws and feelings as the actions and consequents of those that undertake the desperate deeds are observed. The robbery should have taken 10 minutes. 4 hours later, the bank was like a circus sideshow. 8 hours later, it was the hottest thing on live T.V. 12 hours later, it was all history. And it's all true reads the film's tag-line; its 'hook', if you will. Not knowing a thing about the true-to-life events the 1975 released Best Picture nominee is based on may have added an extra layer of dramatic effect, but I've a feeling the film would work just as effectively with the knowledge of said events in mind.The film sees Al Pacino's Sonny Wortzik and John Cazale's Sal hole up in a bank much in the same way a certain John Wojtowicz did in reality with his accomplice Salvatore Naturile, on whose exploits the film is based. Of all the physical things wrong with what they do in conjunction with the robbery, the oral mentioning of their names out loud is probably the worst of the early stages; Sonny's general incompetence masked by Sal's real inability, we feel, to deal with what he's got himself involved in, and consequently coming across as more attributed to the scenario than he actually is.

Typically these films deify heroic teachers whose classrooms are havens at odds with the conformity or mediocrity that plagues the rest of the institution. In this regard, these films merely take familiar stories about admirable loners and nonconformists and place them in an educational setting in which the school milieu is fairly incidental.Films like Stand and Deliver, Dead Poets Society, Mr Holland's Opus, To Sir, with Love, Dangerous Minds, Coach Carter, Mona Lisa Smile, Music of the Heart, Blackboard Jungle, School of Rock, Little Man Tate, Dangerous Minds, Freedom Writers, Pay It Forward etc etc all follow the same narrative progression, the inspirational white\/black teacher moving to a school where he\/she is forced to deal with various problems (racial tensions, student apathy, learning difficulties and institutional barriers), all of which he\/she solves by delivering inspirational messages in offbeat ways.Very few teaching films deviate from this formula. Some of the best that do are perhaps Frederick Wiseman's High School, High School 2 and State Legislature, Laurent Cantet's The Class, Nick Ray's Bigger Than Life, Olivier's Term of Trial, 2002's To Be and To Have, and The Prime of Mrs Jean Brodie, with Maggie Smith. For the most part, though, cinema has failed to produce many interesting teaching movies.And so Dead Poets is another mushy teacher flick which advocates independence and non conformity by sticking to a very generic and clichéd movie formula. Here, the maverick teacher is played by Robin Williams, a wacky guy who inspires his band of students to seize the day and chase their dreams.The film was directed by Peter Weir, and so it has a certain classiness which, at first glance, seems to differentiate it from the pack; it's low-key at times, well acted and beautifully shot. It's only during Poet's last half hour that we realise how much we've been conned. And so as Weir's plot draws toward a typical I am Spartacus! ending (you'll know it when you see it), we begin to grasp how goofy the picture really is, the film populated by one dimensional adults, villainous kids, ridiculously stuck-up parents and a plot which reduces the art of poetry to a couple selectively chosen one liners, all designed to illicit rebelliousness and non conformity.So serious is the film in its message, that it even has one kid commit suicide because he is unable to break free of his father's wishes. In other words, conformity literally kills, physically as well as spiritually. This is a worthwhile message, but the film is so conventionally manipulative in its final half, that all power quickly fizzles out.For a film which pretends to profess a love for poetry, you might even call this flick anti-poetry. Early in the film, Robin Williams draws a graph on a blackboard which he says is used to measure the worth of a poem. On one axis of the graph is a poem's importance or depth, on the other axis of the graph its perfection or technique, the implication being that a work of art which succeeds on both axes, or very highly on one, is discernibly better than others.

Both The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile are weighty but moving period pieces with impeccable characters and an epic quality considering the literal confines of the story. The Green Mile puts a supernatural twist on the genre and though it lacks the inspirational kick that allowed Shawshank to win the hearts of nearly all who've seen it, it holds its own among the many great dramas of the 1990s.Based on the Stephen King novel, The Green Mile is a Depression-era film that takes place in a Southern prison on the cell block that houses the criminals awaiting death and Old Sparky (the electric chair). The ensemble consists of a few of these prisoners and the guards that watch them, led by Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks). The story is partially narrated by the elder version of Edgecomb as he reflects on the strange and life-changing events that occurred in that prison when a large man with mysterious healing abilities named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) arrived.Darabont's adaptation is meaty with smooth and effective story arcs and full-bodied characters who feel 100 percent authentic. Just like in Shawshank, Darabont separates the good guys from the bad guys quickly and they tug at our emotions right away. Doug Hutchison plays the mean-spirited and snotty Percy Wetmore, the one prison guard who's aunt is the governor's wife and tries to use that privilege to behave however he likes. All the other guards (a strong ensemble cast including David Morse and Barry Pepper) treat the prisoners with some humanity, but Percy treats them as if they're the scum of the earth, which easily rattles us. Darabont asks for a small leap of faith in that we're supposed to pity the prisoners, but considering the flaws of the criminal justice system at the time and excessive and unnecessary use of the death penalty, this is not too difficult. In general, Darabont has the uncanny ability to influence his audience and it's everywhere in The Green Mile, namely with characters. The introduction of Sam Rockwell's Wild Bill to the prison is the finest example. He acts catatonic until he gets to the prison and then attacks the guards. From there on out, his subplot is a roller coaster. When he finally gets what he deserves (solitary confinement a couple times) its cathartic for the viewer, but then he's right back at his usual hi-jinx.Character mastery is the strength of the film, but its weakness is the supernatural element. Considering it takes a long while to enter the picture and everything else feels like authentic historical fiction, John Coffey's healing abilities feel out of place even though they drive the latter half of the film. They're intriguing and add a layer of mystery that certainly complicates matters and when it's used it usually has an impact on the more powerful events of the story (one involving a wonderful little mouse named Mr. Jangles). Yet there's still a continuity issue that just kind of snaps the illusion of the film for a brief moment.The Green Mile is often considered one of the greatest tearjerkers of all-time and it certainly warrants that notion whether you cry or not. Rarely does a film pull at your insides like this one, just as it did with Shawshank, and rarely does a three-hour movie manage to never get boring or talk-heavy. Darabont's excellent script carefully places the turning points of the story to ensure just that.Here is a film that will radically influence your perceptions of justice. The line between good and evil in this movie is so thick as if suggesting for every definitive good there is in this world there is its equal. Normally we're introduced in film to characters who suggest every person has the capacity for both, but The Green Mile argues that's not always the case.

Avildsen's breakthrough came with a film that asks the kind of questions that mainstream film wouldn't ask for awhile yet about the impartial portrayal of racists, junkies and gritty urban living. And it does only ask these questions. It doesn't answer much. Its over-the-top climax is a taut little shocker that eschews winding down for a gaping stunned gaze on your face, but as much as it leaves you pondering where the characters all went wrong, the scenes leading up to it don't quite seem to have led there without major, sudden contrivance.The death of an insignificant, drug-dealing junkie loser would be less than probable to be headlined on an NYC TV news program, let alone front page news in an NYC newspaper. Yet because these implausible things implicitly happen, Joe (played stunningly by Peter Boyle), while ranting in a bar, overhears and somehow recalls the name of another customer who fleetingly and facetiously says he's killed a hippie. Days later, Joe not only remembers the man's very general name but is able to track him down, apparently since he's the only person of the name Bill Compton listed in the whole phonebook for a city of several million people. Nevertheless, this movie wants you to think about the implications of its dialogue, the contrast between two men of different classes, and mainly the war between generational values. It's the kind of movie that gets articles written about its perceived commentary on its time, and works as a time capsule for audiences of my generation, forty years later.The film's credited with birthing the vigilante film, wherein characters violate the law to exact justice, rooted in 1970s anxiety toward government corruption, failure in Vietnam, increased crime. These movies point toward the climbing political orientation of neo-conservatism, men who believe good and evil to be cut-and-dried and legal bureaucracy to be elite nutlessness, so they play judge, jury and executioner. Joe and Bill are two of these sorts, but their crusade is not by any means lionized. Their holy war against the counterculture scene catches them off-guard, such as when they make love with some hippie girls, where we see body shame equated with older, more purist generations and upper classes, and the other extreme of exhibitionism seen as social equality. Yet no young character trusts or even likes any older character, and vice versa.The American flag on the poster art of this film indeed deserves higher billing than the main cast, because more than a portrait of Joe or Bill, the movie's a bleak silhouette of the country, at odds with itself, its famous Dream turned sour. This is an inherently fascinating concept. Avildsen would return to it just a few years later in his masterpiece Save the Tiger, which would swing for the bleachers. Here, however, he and writer Norman Wexler seem more concerned with their heavy dependence on sensationalist advertising and broad, lurid overstatement of theme, despite the intrinsic quality of their film. There's so much more about the '60s, '70s generational gap that goes untapped here---Molotov cocktails and sniper fire in response to multicultural textbook curriculums, racial integration in its infancy, homosexuality still considered a mental illness---instead merely concerning older traditional fuddy-duds and younger radical stoners with their dispositions towards sex, drugs and violence.I thought I'd appreciate this movie immensely. Save the Tiger firmly grasped the perceived moral dilemmas of the era, punctured stereotypes that clenched many into angles where they couldn't---still can't---comprehend the people with whom they share their society, or truly grasp the dichotomies that make up the layers of daily life. Joe seems to be even more about such things than that film. Instead, I found its moments of violence, at the beginning and end, to be done with a mawkishly exploitative edge with superfluous percussion-driven music and repetitive editing undercutting the impact. I found myself admiring the occasional scene of dialogue but finding most of them hard to buy, especially those where Bill takes Joe through his upper-crust world to show him how fake his peers are.Nevertheless, resulting from the national media coverage of the Stonehead Manor murders that inspired its climax, Joe snagged a Straight From The Headlines asset upon release. Without the murders, it's unlikely that this low-budget exploitation film would've found a wide audience, which instead it did, earning millions in domestic receipts. Furthermore, it's likely that the similarities between the real-life murders and the movie's dog-eared premise inspired the Academy to nominate Wexler's passable screenplay for an Oscar. It's also likely that the wider audiences helped launch newcomers Avildsen, Boyle and Sarandon. And that's not such a bad thing.

Making a movie about Amish people is haphazard and, as with Witness it is often a compilation of clichés (barn raisings, riding in buggies, etc.) that doesn't have much depth, it shows us what we already know about Amish culture but doesn't have any particular insight into it. The corrupt cop plot is a tired one and Witness has nothing particularly new to add, the story is just about corrupt cops being corrupt. No real depth there either.Despite this, Witness manages to be pretty good. The pacing is very slow but appropriate, spending the first third of the movie introducing us to Rachel and her son Samuel, two Amish heading to Baltimore when Samuel witnesses a brutal murder that he learns was committed by a Philadelphia cop with connections. Harrison Ford is John Book, the good cop police captain who inadvertently tips his hand to the bad cops, survives an assassination attempt and has to hide out in Amish country of all places.This movie can be looked at a lot of ways but the consensus seems to be that the basic cop story plot is simply an excuse to put a gritty Harrison Ford character in the bucolic and appealing Amish setting for an hour or so. There he must negotiate an alien culture and deal with the mutual feelings developing between him and Rachel. It is obvious that Ford's excellent natural acting skills carry the movie, easily smoothing over the potential absurdities of the plot. Everyone remembers the barn raising scene, but the moment where Book and Rachel dance in the dimly lit barn to the wonderfully slow cover of (What a) Wonderful World is a stunning and excellent scene, perfectly capturing the emotion between the two characters in a way just about everyone in the audience should be able to fondly relate to.The directer does a good job of showing you the way of life of the Amish (or at least, his version of it) without hammering you over the head with it, and Harrison's low-intensity acting is the perfect match for that. Sure these aren't real Amish people by any stretch of the imagination, but it's a Hollywood movie, what were you really expecting?The result of this is that a bunch of potential cinematic duds just happen to work right. The generic cop story is just interesting enough to hook you in to the charmingly exploitative adventures of Indiana Jones in Amish Country.

Yet these are really only strongly inferred, but not shown. Actually, what is really frightening is the situation of Catherine. She has to prove her sanity, but the people she needs to prove it to have a big financial interest in finding her insane. The corrupting power of money is the real horror the film exposes. We should remember that many women were victims of sexist psychological practices throughout the 20th century. Most lobotomies were performed on women.Acting wise, I love Kate, Montgomery and Elizabeth, so I think I can be fair. Kate and Montgomery are good, but they didn't deliver their usual Oscar-worthy performances. Kate's transitions are not believable and Montgomery comes off as too namby-pamby (as William Shatner once said on Boston Legal). Elizabeth Taylor, on the other hand, surprised me. She does give an Oscar worthy performance. Although she does not appear in the first third of the movie, she really takes over and carries the film. the climax of the film is a difficult ten minute monologue and she is riveting.We should remember that the Hollywood censorship office was still active at the time. Homosexuality could not be openly discussed. William Wyler couldn't even do it a year later when he made the gay themed The Children's Hour. In the 1946 film Crossfire a man is killed because he is Jewish. In the original novel that it was based on, the man was killed because he was a homosexual. Homosexuality had to be recoded as Jewishness. It is a testament to Tennessee Williams that he didn't recode it to fit the sexual censorship conventions. We should remember that Williams fought the censorship in Hollywood toe to toe for more than ten years, and in the end the sexual censors were beaten.This movie is still a bit unpleasant and edgy, even after 50 years, but isn't that what most great art usually is?

One might cite the bizarre elements of an image of a savage God, incest and cannibalism. Yet these are really only strongly inferred, but not shown. Actually, what is really frightening is the situation of Catherine. She has to prove her sanity, but the people she needs to prove it to have a big financial interest in finding her insane. The corrupting power of money is the real horror the film exposes. We should remember that many women were victims of sexist psychological practices throughout the 20th century. Most lobotomies were performed on women.Acting wise, I love Kate, Montgomery and Elizabeth, so I think I can be fair. Kate and Montgomery are good, but they didn't deliver their usual Oscar-worthy performances. Kate's transitions are not believable and Montgomery comes off as too namby-pamby (as William Shatner once said on Boston Legal). Elizabeth Taylor, on the other hand, surprised me. She does give an Oscar worthy performance. Although she does not appear in the first third of the movie, she really takes over and carries the film. the climax of the film is a difficult ten minute monologue and she is riveting.We should remember that the Hollywood censorship office was still active at the time. Homosexuality could not be openly discussed. William Wyler couldn't even do it a year later when he made the gay themed The Children's Hour. In the 1946 film Crossfire a man is killed because he is Jewish. In the original novel that it was based on, the man was killed because he was a homosexual.

It is also well shot, well edited, and while the story is kind of silly, it never gets too convoluted and it says linear and focused. It's not a great movie, but as it stands, it makes a pretty fun thriller.It is fight night in Altantic City, and the Secretary of Defence is attending. Unfortunately for him (and the nation I supposed) he is gunned down in the middle of the match. Panic erupts, and the police lock down the arena, leaving fourteen thousand possible suspects and\/or eye witnesses inside. It is up to detective Rick Santoro to gets some answers.If I am gonna make any complains about the film, it would be the following two. Nicholas Cage (as usual) over-acts BIG TIME!!! I MEAN HE REALLY OVER DOES HIS PERFORMANCE!!!!!!! WHAT THE HECK??!!! ............excuse me. I also find the Climactic finale a bit over directed. Any who knows movies, knows that Brian de Palma likes to stage his adrenaline like an opera, with bold assertive scoring, and slow motion, plus an emphasis on physical acting. Sometimes it feels right, sometimes not. One thing he always gets right though, is his integration of a long sweeping shot. Snake Eyes begins with one, and it takes up most of the first scene in fact, that's pretty good.Snake Eyes despite its flaws is crafted skillfully enough to sustain a viewer for a hundred minutes. It is not a film that needs to be seen but it is a good one to watch if you catch it on the box one night.

And with that being stated, I cannot endorse and celebrate with the general masses on this piece of art. Because it sucks ball.The movie grants me with an ending of extreme discomfort that I have to bang my head continuously against the DVD-cover and question what was the 88-mins content I just spent starring critically on the screen is essentially about? I finally come to term with myself and realize that it's just a bunch of baloneys. What's even better is I get to watch the stupid story told 4 times differently. Very nice! The story's plot is embellished with characters that capable of bringing the art of silly overreacting to a higher realm of mastery, especially Toshiro Mifune. It also has one of the best sword-duel scene in the history of cinema that consists of the constant tripping over twigs, running around trees, dropping swords, ridiculous facial expressions and screaming. This particular scene, with an addition of a cheesy Indian song, would make a perfect blockbuster Bollywood flick.The movie has no resolution afterward. You just have to take in the 4 different versions of the account without knowing the truth in the end even though I don't see the motivation for the woodcutter to lie but you never know what's the real story. Perhaps, it's better that way because up to that point, if given that the woodcutter lies too, I'm too fed up for the real account even if they decide to reveal it.Do yourself a favor and watch Yojimbo - Kurosawa's best.
