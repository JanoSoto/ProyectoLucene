Whilst they have the main hero(es)battling triumphing over evil in such typical fashion, Mystery Men is the complete flip side to that. In the film, they are on a mission to rescue Captain Fantastic- aka the hugely talented Greg Kinnear- from an evil enemy known as Casanova Frankenstein- aka Geoffery Rush- (great name for a baddie BTW!). The superheroes that make up The Mystery Men are struggling and are of which some of the most inventive-yet amusing ever created. Names include Mr Furious, played by Ben Stiller of where he reminds me of the incredible hulk- personality-wise the fact that he loses his temper and thus as a result, he unleashes his powers against his foes, The Shoveler, played by the underrated and yet impressive William H Macy who takes on villains wearing a mining helmet and brandishing, um, a shovel as his weapon of choice! As well as The Invisible Boy, of whom can only become invisible when nobody is looking(very strange concept indeed!)and The Bowler, who has a bowling ball as her main fighting weapon. Making up the crew are The Spinx and The Blue Raja. The Blue Raja intrigued me a little, considering that at first with the extremely posh London accent, I would've thought the director and Casting Director would've hired a British actor in its place. However, my mind had changed afterwards after seeing a scene where the Raja has a phone call with his mother- and he speaks to her in his real- life American accent, which was very funny! But the character that really got to me was The Spleen and his fart jokes became a little annoying and irksome, the longer the film went on. Nonetheless, they are slightly more interesting than most so-called established superheroes.Before this film came out, I had never heard of, nor familiarised myself with the comics, despite this though where Mystery Men differs and does well, in comparison to those so-called superhero films is that it is very much a parody of and a somewhat smart mickey take on comic book superheroes. Unlike Cyclops, Wolverine and Storm to name, for the exception of Captain Fantastic, Mystery Men's counterparts are still down-to-earth- yet unsuccessful, and of whom carry with them an abundance of wit, charm, silliness and humour. And whilst, the cast is made up of virtually non-A listers, the fact that it has an array of stellar acting talent in the shape of Ben Stiller, William H Macy, Greg Kinnear, Hank Azaria and Geoffery Rush,of whom all provide really good performances as their characters, is impressive still. Plus, they carry the film well without having to succumb to such patronising and overbearing levels of so-called superhero worshipping and conformity in American society and a high level of public expectation being thrusted upon them. The humour is very dry and so unless you are a fan of this type of humour, as well as being a comic book fan, then unfortunately the wise cracks and jokes will not be of your taste and preference.Mystery Men does not attempt to live up to the expectations of films such as Superman, Spider-man, X-Men, nor does it seek to be a rival to those mainstream comic book efforts, rather that it delves deeper into the so- called superhero myth and disseminates and ridicules it by means of questioning a) what it stands for, b)how it is depicted, c) by attacking (not in a harsh way that is) the very conventions and popularisation of superheroes. By means of which i am saying that the likes of the X-Men trilogy, Batman, Fantastic Four etc have become so accepted by the mainstream and in the Hollywood movie business that its initial comic book roots and origins have been stripped away and as a result, its cult factor has deteriorated. Therefore, some of its so called cultural values has been eroded, because of their commercialisation. Or in other words, they have sold out to the mainstream public. Mystery Men, however is a comedic comic book adaptation that is unique, inventive and intriguing that the concept remains original, both to its fans and the comic book fraternity. The dialogue is witty and sharp and the amount of sarcasm is evenly spreaded out within this film, so much so that it doesn't deviate from the script, nor the main plot.Overall, it is a delightful superhero and comic book romp, which as it is a parody, rightfully doesn't take itself too seriously.

It's classic Hitchcock direction, of course, but the plot tries to cover too many stories and it just becomes tiresome after a while. First there's the mystery surrounding Madeleine's 'possession', then the love story between her and Scotty, then the mystery surrounding her death, and then the love story between Scotty and Judy, and then - finally - the completion of the mystery. Too much flip-flopping between the various mysteries and love stories. I also thought that Scotty's vertigo should have been more incorporated into the film - it shows up once at the beginning, once in the middle, once at the end, and that's it. Still, Stewart is great and Novak is gorgeous and fantastic in her dualish role, and it's fantastically directed, of course. I would have loved it if it had followed the promise shown in the opening scene, but alas, only the trippy dream sequence and the stuff in the bell tower does so. Still a pretty good film, though.

It seems so safe, so welcoming, so warm and so cosy. Yet, by the time Lynch replays this sequence at the end of the film, we know that underneath this façade lies a terrifying reality, where innocence dare not tread.Lynch's modern masterpiece is obsessed with the strangeness that hides in the nooks and crannies of suburban America. It's essentially a detective story, in which two all-American heroes, Jeffrey (MacLachlan) and Sandy (Dern), try to solve the mystery surrounding a chopped-off ear. In the process, they discover that their hometown isn't quite as boringly innocent as it first appears. It also loosely combines elements of film-noir, being one of the greatest post-1950s films to do so.What makes Blue Velvet so special, though, is the way in which Lynch turns this simple set-up into a psychosexual drama that would make even Freud shake his head in disbelief. Jeffrey and Sandy are babes in the woods who stumble into the very adult world of nightclub singer Dorothy (Rossellini) and her torturer-lover Frank (Hopper) - the big bad wolf in this Grimm fairy tale. What they witness is something that their mom and apple pie family life has never prepared them for - S\/M, kidnapping, murder, and various sexual perversions.A classic in its own right, Blue Velvet will go on to be one of the greatest American films ever made, despite the fact that many object to this because of its dark, almost unflinching content.***** out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"30 June 2007","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" David Lynch's influential 1986 thriller Blue Velvet opens with a colourful picture-perfect vision of small town America, set to the strains of the eponymous song.

The Agatha Christie mystery was adapted from a stage play and directed with great expertise by the legendary Billy Wilder. The cast is impeccable right down to the smallest role.Solisitor Sir Wifred Robarts (Charles Laughton) is returning from convalescing from a heart attack along with his personal nurse Miss Plimsoll (Elsa Lanchester) who denies him all the things he enjoys. Sir Wilfred has been ordered to take it easy and plans a long vacation.As luck would have it, Barrister Mayhew (Henry Daniell) arrives at Sir Wilfred's office with possible murder suspect Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) in tow. Mayhew pleads with Sir Wilfred to take the case but he resists. Sir Wilfred recommends his colleague Brogan-Moore (John Williams) to try the case. Vole's arrest is imminent.In flashbacks, we learn how Vole met the murdered woman, Emily French (Norma Varden) and courted her to win her favor and obtain a couple of hundred pounds to finance his latest invention. Vole it seems has been unable to hold down a job and seemingly preys upon lonely older women. We also learn of how Vole met his wife Christine (Marlene Dietrich) in Germany during WWII, married her and brought her to London.Vole is arrested and Sir Wilfred, against the protests of Miss Plimsoll and his assistant Carter (Ian Wolfe), decides to take on the case. Prosecuter Myers (Torin Thatcher) presents a strong case against Vole. Christina backs her husband's story. But suddenly the prosecution presents a final witness for the prosecution,,,,Christina who has unbeknown st to Sir Wilfred, agreed to testify against her husband. Ah, but is she really Vole's wife? Sir Wilfred presents only one witness for the defense...Vole himself. But with Christina's testimony, the case appears to be lost until...........................The last 15 minutes or so of the film present many unexpected surprises which I will leave for you to enjoy.The acting in this film is nothing short of incredible. Power and in particular, Dietrich and Laughton are all outstanding. Power as the beleaguered defendant gives one of his best performances. Dietrich, looking like a million bucks, proves that she was a much better actress than she was ever given credit for. Laughton though, steals the picture with his performance as the rumpled old solicitor for the defense. You're never quite sure that he will make it through the trial.Elsa Lanchester, who was married to Laughton, is good as the fussy old nurse and the marvelous Una O'Connor turns in another of her patented old hag performances. Others in the cast include Francis Compton as the judge and a very young Ruta Lee as a gallery spectator.The film received many Oscar nominations but was unfortunately up against The Bridge on the River Quai that year. Quai won the Best Picture and Alec Guiness the Best actor awards and deservedly so, but this film was also worthy of Best Picture and Power, Dietrich and Laughton also turned in Oscar worthy performances.If you've never seen this film, I highly recommend it. It hold up extremely well even 50 years after its initial release. And the ending, I envy you when you watch it for the first time.This was Tyrone Power's final film. He passed away the following year while filming Soloman and Sheba of a heart attack.An excellent film.
