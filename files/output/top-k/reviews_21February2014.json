","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"21 February 2014","score":"","review":" On July 6th, 1994, this country was introduced to another movie that will go down as one of the all-time greatest films in United States history. This movie is Forrest Gump (Zemeckis, 1994), and it was directed by Robert Zemeckis. Forrest Gump (Zemeckis, 1994) will always be known as one of the best films of all times as years go by. It is the story of a simple minded man from Greenbow, Alabama, named Forrest Gump, who lives life in the moment and succeeds in everything he does as he finds himself contributing to many historical events of the mid twentieth century without even trying. There are many different aspects to this film that make it great, but there are a few significant ones that stand out among the rest. The significant aspects that make this such a great film include the use of Tom Hanks, the memorable soundtrack, historical references, and the heart-warming love story.Tom Hanks is the star in the film Forrest Gump (Zemeckis, 1994) as he plays the role of the main character, Forrest Gump. Tom Hanks had been a big time actor in Hollywood even prior to his outstanding performance in this movie as he also starred in films such as Big, A League of Their Own, and Sleepless in Seattle. Forrest Gump (Zemeckis, 1994) was not an easy movie to play the lead role in as he had to play the role as a mentally challenged man with an I.Q. of seventy five and keep that role consistent through the entire movie. This role cannot be easily achieved by just anyone, but Tom Hanks went above and beyond playing the role of Forrest Gump. Tom Hanks earned himself an abundance of awards from this movie that consisted of a Golden Globe, an Academy Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a People's Choice Award for Best Actor, becoming only the fourth actor to win consecutive awards.The soundtrack of Forrest Gump (Zemeckis, 1994) is another aspect that makes this movie so great. A movie's soundtrack can really set the tone for a scene, and the soundtrack of Forrest Gump (Zemeckis, 1994) succeeded in setting a good tone with its choice of music. The movie's setting takes place from the mid to late twentieth century, and the movie's soundtrack is mostly based around that time setting with songs from that era. The soundtrack consisted of many 1960 and 1970s artists and bands such as Creedence Clearwater Revival, Elvis Presley, the Beach Boys, Simon & Garfunkel, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and many more. The soundtrack of the movie really set the feel of the time setting it was placed in. The soundtrack was rated among the top ten for several months in the Billboard 200 album chart when the movie was first released.The historical references in this movie make things a little bit more interesting through the way Forrest Gump somehow finds himself contributing to them. Throughout the movie Forrest Gump found himself in a lot of significant moments of US history without even knowing it. The first reference was in the beginning of the movie when Forrest reveals that he was named after Nathan Bedford Forrest, who was the leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Another example is when Forrest was a young boy his mother had a bed and breakfast, and they had a young musician staying with them by the name of Elvis Presley. Forrest had braces on his legs and was dancing to the music Elvis Presley was playing on his guitar. This dance that Forrest had displayed to Presley ended up being Presley's signature move when he became famous. Later on in Forrest's life, he was staying in the Watergate hotel where he witnessed the Watergate Scandal. Forrest called the front desk and told them what he saw, and, without even knowing it, he was the reason President Nixon was impeached for the Watergate Scandal. Many other significant parts of U.S. history were referenced in the movie such as the Vietnam War, in which Forrest fought in, the Black Panthers, the hippie movement, and even more. This movie does a good job of showing how the U.S. progressed from the 1960s through the 1980s to make this movie more interesting.Forrest Gump (Zemeckis, 1994) not only provides a sense of humor and drama throughout the movie, but it also has a twist of love throughout the movie as well. Forrest fell in love quickly with a girl named Jenny when he meets her on the bus for his first day of school. He and Jenny spent most of their childhood together, but seem to fade apart as their lives went on. However, this did not keep Forrest from maintaining his love for her. Despite Jenny eluding him, Forrest did not let her go and continued to love her. Forrest and Jenny end up having a baby together and get married in order for Forrest to be the father of the child. This love story puts a great twist in the movie to put an emotional toll on the audience. It shows that anybody can love anybody despite any circumstances.Overall, Forrest Gump (Zemeckis, 1994) is a great movie with a great message that will go down as one of the all-time best. The movie contains many different aspects that lead it to being such a great film. The use of Tom Hanks, the memorable soundtrack, historical references, and the heart-warming love story, all make this movie what it is. Forrest Gump (Zemeckis, 1994) will be a film that people will watch and love for a long time.

The film was an instant success making $225,933,435 at the box office (imdb.com). The success of the movie did not come from fancy effects, or intense action scenes; however it is the script that captures the audience, which makes us, fall in love with the characters as well as the movie as a whole. The aspect of the movie that stood out the most to me was the excellent story line, which was beautifully executed by the phenomenal acting and powerful performances of the main characters, Affleck, Damon and along with the support of Robin Williams, who made this movie such a success. The script written by Damon and Affleck, won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, which did not surprise me. Damon began writing Good Will Hunting in his fifth year at Harvard in a playwriting class. As a result, what was supposed to be a one act play had turn into the movie that turned these struggling actors into instant A list celebrities. (Nanos) It is very unique that the writers are able to star in their own movie, which in my opinion helped them portray the story exactly the way they wanted it. They were both a double-threat, being both the actors and script writers. Damon and Affleck were childhood friends who grew up together as aspiring actors. Both from Cambridge, Massachusetts, they were able to at authentically portray their characters as well as the city of Boston. They were extremely familiar with the setting, they were trying to depict to the audience, being from Boston, which made this film so popular among Boston residents as well as people from across the country. (Nanos) Many of the local residents were cast as extras one noted, the clothing was right, the way they acted, the accents, the cars they drove.(Good Will HuntingReleased) Everything was absolutely perfect. In addition, the two were real life best friends, making the on screen chemistry between that much better. As a result, Damon and Affleck were the ideal pair to star in this movie. Robin Williams also won an Oscar for the movie for best supporting role. In creating the latter character, the screenplay offers Robin Williams the rare serious role that takes full advantage of his talents (New york times). Williams' character Sean; helps develop Will, who is the most dynamic character in this story. Without the role of Williams, and the relationship between the two, we would not see Will grow and ultimately change into the new man he becomes at the end of the movie. The back and forth arguing between Will and Sean made them so entertaining, this film is bright and knowing enough to bring fresh energy to the jousting between Will and Sean McGuire, the fellow underachiever who proves to be the only therapist who can handle him(new york times) A life long friendship was soon formed between the two who challenging each other every step of the way. The film strains slightly in creating a set of neatly parallel friendships and by finding too many echoes of Will's problems in Sean's own past. But what it does beautifully is to develop a doctor-patient sparring that becomes affecting and important to both parties(new york times) They both wanted each other to do more which their lives, which resulted in how the movie was ended. Sean was able to put his cards back on the table with the help of Will, and because of Sean's advice to Do what's in your heart and you'll be fine(Good Will Hunting, 1997) The passion and genuine care Sean has for Will was obvious, resulting in a connection from the audience, making them want the same things for Will as Sean did. The love story aspect of the film makes it a feel good movie, which makes the audience realize what is important in life. Even though some critics claim that the plot is predictable, the movie is ended in an ironic way that surprised me (new york times). Based on the Will I knew at the beginning, I would've never expected him to go after Skylar like he did. His transformation made me realize how love can be so important and almost the only thing someone needs in life to be happy. Based on Sean's touching speech about the love he had with his wife, you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable. Known someone could level you with her eyes. Feeling like! God put an angel on earth just for you&#x85;who could rescue you from the depths of hell. And you wouldn't know what it's like to be her angel and to have that love for her to be there forever(Good Will Hunting, 1997). At the end of the film Will was finally able to realize that he found this love with Skylar. He drives all the way across the country to be with her, which represents how love is greater than anything else. I would definitely recommend this movie. It is a touching, sentimental film, portraying life's common hardships that people deal with on a daily bases that allows the audience to connect with it. Good Will Hunting (Van Sant, 1997) opened my eyes to the meaning of love as well as what is important in life, leaving me completely satisfied after watching the movie. The feel good American drama, which unfolds as a love story, is definitely a classic that leaves me feeling the same emotions every time I watch it.

Sean was able to put his cards back on the table with the help of Will, and because of Sean's advice to Do what's in your heart and you'll be fine(Good Will Hunting, 1997) The passion and genuine care Sean has for Will was obvious, resulting in a connection from the audience, making them want the same things for Will as Sean did. The love story aspect of the film makes it a feel good movie, which makes the audience realize what is important in life. Even though some critics claim that the plot is predictable, the movie is ended in an ironic way that surprised me (new york times). Based on the Will I knew at the beginning, I would've never expected him to go after Skylar like he did. His transformation made me realize how love can be so important and almost the only thing someone needs in life to be happy. Based on Sean's touching speech about the love he had with his wife, you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable. Known someone could level you with her eyes. Feeling like! God put an angel on earth just for you&#x85;who could rescue you from the depths of hell. And you wouldn't know what it's like to be her angel and to have that love for her to be there forever(Good Will Hunting, 1997). At the end of the film Will was finally able to realize that he found this love with Skylar. He drives all the way across the country to be with her, which represents how love is greater than anything else. I would definitely recommend this movie. It is a touching, sentimental film, portraying life's common hardships that people deal with on a daily bases that allows the audience to connect with it. Good Will Hunting (Van Sant, 1997) opened my eyes to the meaning of love as well as what is important in life, leaving me completely satisfied after watching the movie. The feel good American drama, which unfolds as a love story, is definitely a classic that leaves me feeling the same emotions every time I watch it.

In this, the fourth and final film of the first Batman movie cycle, it appears that all stops were pulled in trying to emulate the Adam West TV series from the Sixties. The entire picture is pure camp and hard to take seriously if you're a true fan of the costumed hero. Not only that, but the actor portraying the main title character isn't even listed at the top of the credits. Instead it's Arnold Schwarzenneger in the thankless role of the film's main antagonist, Mr. Freeze. I sure would like to know what he thinks about this picture today.The idea of three heroes squaring off against three villains was certainly overkill here, especially when characters like Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone) and Bane (Jeep Swenson) seemed superfluous to the story most of the time. I recall thinking when the picture came out what a waste of time it was to use the Bane character here since he was so formidable in the comics. After all he broke Batman's back and was the new terror of Gotham in the late Nineties. In this picture he's done in by a few mere body blows and it's curtains for the Banester. Very disappointing.If there's anything to write home about it would be everyone's favorite bad girl, Uma Thurman, as the mischievous Poison Ivy. She calls to mind Julie Newmar's take on the Catgirl of the Adam West days, although a bit overdone with the environmental puns. In another time and place, say the 1940's, a horror flick utilizing an aloe blood and skin with chlorophyll gimmick would have been pretty nifty. I can just see Bela Lugosi sending out his creation with a poison kiss to do away with his enemies.One thing that was cool (no pun intended there) was seeing Jesse Ventura in a quick cameo as an Arkham Asylum prison guard. So that would make it the third time that two future governors appeared in a picture together. Predator' and The Running Man were the other two. Makes you wonder how these guys ever got elected.

The Lion King, released in 1994, was directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff. The estimated budget for the film was around $45,000,000 (imdb.com). Starring the voices of Matthew Broderick as Simba the lion, Nathan Lane as Timon the meercat, and Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa the warthog. The film received many nominations for awards, and it won an Oscar for the song Can you feel the love tonight. It won Golden Globes for best soundtrack score, best original song for Can you feel the love tonight, and best motion picture in the Comedy\/Musical category. The plot revolves around a young lion named Simba who is next in line to become the king of the Pride Lands. His best friend is a young lioness named Nala and they are to be married when they are old enough. His father, Mufasa, is the current king and is happily married to Sarabi, the head lioness. Mufasa has a hornbill for an adviser named Zazu, and a younger brother named Scar. Scar is friends with the hyenas, and together they make an evil team. Scar is jealous because now Simba will become the king instead of Scar. He wants his revenge, so he comes up with a plan to get rid of Mufasa and Simba for good. The movies starts out with the wise baboon Rafiki showing off Simba to all of the animals in the Pride Lands. One day, Simba and Nala go to an elephant graveyard, despite being forbidden to go there. They are attacked by three of the hyenas; Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed. They are about to kill the lion cubs when Mufasa, being warned by Zazu, shows up and saves them both. Simba is then reprimanded and he promises his father that he will become more obedient. A short while later Scar decides to get his revenge. He leads Simba down to the gorge and tells him to work on his wimpy roar. The three hyenas are at the top of the gorge and they cause a stampede of wildebeests into the gorge, putting Simba's life in danger. Zazu then warns Mufasa of Simba's whereabouts and Mufasa rushes to save him. Mufasa saves Simba, but is injured by the stampeding herd. When he tries to climb up the gorge, Scar digs his claws into Mufasa's paws and throws him back down killing him. Scar then blames Simba for Mufasa's death and tells the cub to run away, and never return (The Lion King, 1994). Simba runs away and is quickly found by Timon and Pumbaa, two good natured friends who want to help Simba with his problems. The three live together for many years and base their lives on the slogan Hakuna Matata which means No Worries (The Lion King, 1994). One day as the friends are out and about, a female lioness spots Pumbaa and tries to hunt and kill him. Simba, now a grown lion, attacks the lioness and the two struggle. Simba then recognizes her as Nala, his childhood friend. The two catch up and Nala tells him that Scar has ruined the Pride Lands, allowing the hyenas to rule with him and that Simba needs to come back and claim his place as king. However, Simba is still overcome with the guilt of believing that he killed his father and he refuses to go back. He is then reminded by Rafiki that his father lives within him and wants him to go back to his home and take his rightful place as king. Simba returns to his home to find it in ruins. It is dark and grey, there are hyenas everywhere and everyone seems sad and broken down. When Scar sees Simba, Scar's first thought is that Mufasa had risen from the dead since Simba looked so much like his father. Scar tries to humiliate Simba by telling all of the lions that Simba killed his father. Scar and Simba then start fighting and lightning strikes starting a fire. Scar almost overpowers Simba and he holds Simba off a cliff in the same manner that he held Mufasa off the cliff.

He throws his uncle over a small cliff, where the hyenas attack and kill Scar. It promptly starts raining putting out the fire, and Simba takes his place as king of the Pride Lands. A while later the Pride Lands have been restored to their previous natural beauty. Simba married Nala and the two have had a son.

The movie was directed by Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook and used the voices of Miguel Ferrer, Eddie Murphy, and Lea Salonga for some of the main characters (International Movie Database.) During opening weekend, Mulan grossed almost 23 million dollars. The movie went on to make 121 million in the United States and about 304 million in world wide gross revenue (Box Office Mojo.) The movie was nominated for both an Oscar and a Golden Globe for its original music and received and received an American Society of Composers and Publishers Award for top box office films in 1999. The film was also nominated for and received multiple Annie Awards (International Movie Database.) This 88 minute animated musical begins with a scene of peaceful China being invaded at night by a group of Mongolian nomads referred to throughout the movie as Huns. (The Xionnu Culture.) The Huns are clearly a major threat to China's society. The audience is then introduced to the main character in the movie named Mulan. Mulan is a young woman who is struggling to come of age the way that her Chinese culture wants her to. She is expected to have the poise and grace of a Chinese lady and is scheduled that afternoon to meet with a matchmaker. Her mother and grandmother help her prepare to meet the matchmaker and give her a small cricket in a cage to carry with her for luck. When Mulan gets to the matchmakers house, things do not go as planned and Mulan ends up spilling hot tea on the woman, making her look clumsy and ill prepared to be a bride. The matchmaker shames Mulan, stating that she will never bring honor to the family as Mulan runs out of the house. Later in the day, the general from the imperial army arrives in their town, stating that one man from each family must go to war to fight against the Huns. Since Mulan's father, an honored veteran himself, is the only male in their family, it is obvious that he must go again to war. It is very dangerous for her father to do this because he is old and could very easily be killed in battle. After watching her father and mother have a quiet conversation, Mulan decides to take matters into her own hands. She cuts her hair and takes her father's armor and horse, leaving for war in the middle of a stormy night. Alarmed by Mulan's actions, her ancestors' spirits awaken and discuss what they should do about the situation. Eager to prove himself, Mushu, a small red dragon, decides that he is going to find Mulan and assist her in becoming a war hero. Mushu appears to Mulan just as she is about to enter the army's camp. He gives her tips on how to walk and talk like a man but it is clear as soon as she walks into the camp that she is extremely out of place. She accidentally starts a fight between the warriors and when the newly appointed captain Shang-Yu walks out, he is obviously disappointed in the group and specifically Mulan. Mulan introduces herself awkwardly as Ping and the group begins training. Things are hard for Mulan at first because she has to adjust to acting like a man and keeping up physically with the rest of the troop. Slowly but surely, however, she begins to prove herself as a valuable asset to the army. When Mulan's troop is called into battle early because of a letter that Mushu writes from the general, Mulan is determined to prove herself further as a warrior. As they travel, the troop comes across an abandoned town, one that had obviously fallen victim to the Huns. The troop is then ambushed by the Huns from the top of a snowy mountain and is eventually forced to confront a group of them head on. Clearly outnumbered, it is obvious that Mulan's troop will not win this battle. However, Mulan thinks quickly and comes up with a fast solution to beat the Huns. She seizes the last cannon and runs toward the enormous group of approaching Huns. Once she gets to a close enough spot, she lights the cannon and shoots it directly towards a snowy mountain. This causes a huge avalanche that wipes out most of the Hun's troop, ending the war and making Mulan's troop the heroes of China. Despite her valiant efforts to keep her womanhood a secret, she is discovered the next night after Shang had heard many rumors that she was female. Instead of killing her as the law demanded, Shang decides to spare her life, claiming that she saved his life the day before and now the two are even. Ashamed that she had yet again disgraced her family, Mulan sets out to leave for home. While she is leaving, Mulan notices that there are Huns still alive and races to the ceremony where the rest of the army is being honored for her accomplishments to warn them. The troops do not believe her until the Huns themselves appear at the ceremony and kidnap the emperor, locking him inside the palace. Mulan runs to the scene and comes up with an elaborate plan to break into the castle to save the emperor. Her plan works and Mulan is recognized by the emperor himself as a great hero of China and offered a position on his council. However, instead of accepting this great honor, Mulan states that she would like to return to her home, hugs her new friends, and turns to walk away. As she is leaving, Shang realizes that he is in love with Mulan and goes with her. The two return home as great heroes of China.

It is a bona fide classic of the crime genre. This low budget thriller was able to capture the attention of audiences worldwide with a surprise ending that leaves viewers with more questions than answers. This movie is layered with a complex plot generating intrigue. While the complexity of the film, enthralled most, some viewers may be left with an unfavorable view of the film due to the complexity; but for the cerebral viewer, it delivers intrigue, action, and a clever thought out plot captivating the viewer to the end. I believe that this is precisely the audience that Bryan Singer sought and delivered to with his grand design. It lends itself to multiple viewings to dissect the plot. The directing in the movie parallels to that of a Quentin Tarantino movie, with cold blooded, ruthless, characters, violence, and gore filled scenes. Through the use of clever flashback, the movie seems so much bigger that what it actually is. All that really happens during the movie is that Roger  Verbal Kint completes his testimony with Dave Kujan, a detective following a hunch. The movie follows Verbal's testimony, going through the events and with details being filled in as Kujan asks for clarification. Kujan thought there was more to the story than met the eye, and Verbal, played by Kevin Spacey gave Kujan all he could ask for and more. Throughout the whole movie Spacey's brilliant acting convinces the audience almost pity Verbal, who is a cripple with cerebral palsy and a bad limp. This pity for Verbal only makes the ending even more satisfying, where everything that the audience had come to believe throughout the first 100 minutes of film becomes unraveled within the last five. This movie leaves one with more questions than answers, and many holes in the story are left to the imagination, in my opinion only making this story more intriguing. The Usual Suspects was a relatively low budget movie, with production costs around six million dollars. In comparison, another movie from 1995, Cutthroat Island cost 98 million dollars to produce. In terms of grossing, The Usual Suspects grossed over 23 million dollars in the US alone. while the astronomical budget Cutthroat Island only grossed a little over a measly 18 million dollars worldwide. One may be asking 'why does this matter'? I believe that this matters because production costs are one of the limiting factors of being a director. Bryan Singer was able to produce a captivating movie in an era that was already over-saturated with great crime thrillers made in the early 1990's, with a budget that would leave some directors at a loss. By other great crime fillers I am talking about Silence of the Lambs, Pulp Fiction, and Goodfellas to name a few. Although Singer did a standup job filming the movie, he cannot take full credit for this masterpiece. The scriptwriter Christopher McQuarrie actually won the best original screenplay at the academy awards, only further exemplifying the quality of this movie. Christopher McQuarrie was not the only one from the movie The Usual Suspects to win an academy award. Kevin Spacey gave the performance of a lifetime playing Verbal Kint, and was awarded the best supporting actor at the academy awards in 1995 (The Usual Suspects). Verbal has a lot more to him than meets the eye, and throughout the entire movie one can tell there is something off about him. Verbal is a cripple with cerebral palsy, a criminal, and is told repeatedly throughout the movie that he isn't intelligent. Kevin Spacey sells the part, allowing the audience to put verbal in a box as a sorry criminal deserving nothing but pity, and almost allowing the audience to empathize with Verbal for having been drawn into detective Kujan's office. This feeling of empathy is completely replaced by a mixture of awe and confusion by the end of this movie. As previously mentioned, scriptwriter Christopher McQuarrie won the best original screenplay at the academy awards . This movie was extremely complex, too confusing in the opinion of some viewers, including film critic legend Roger Ebert, who unfortunately gave this film only 1.5 stars out of four and named this movie to his 50 most hated films of all time list. The reason for the complexity was out of design, in my opinion, as the story Verbal crafted was not really important. This is revealed at the end of the movie, when Kujan realizes that Verbal is actually Kaiser Söze, and that the entire testimony had been fabricated based on various words and pictures that were in his office. This crazy ending is the reason that McQuarrie won the award, and is also the reason that I enjoy this movie so much. In an instant, this movie transforms from being a confusing crime thriller, into a masterpiece, leaving the it to the imagination of the viewer to decipher if there was any truth to verbal Kint's testimony. This Film has stood the test of time, and can now be considered a crime thriller classic. The surprise ending, the acting, and the directing all worked in harmony to produce one of my favorite movies of all time. This movie gets a 10\/10 in my book, and should be on the list of anybody that likes good twist ending.

This is revealed at the end of the movie, when Kujan realizes that Verbal is actually Kaiser Söze, and that the entire testimony had been fabricated based on various words and pictures that were in his office. This crazy ending is the reason that McQuarrie won the award, and is also the reason that I enjoy this movie so much. In an instant, this movie transforms from being a confusing crime thriller, into a masterpiece, leaving the it to the imagination of the viewer to decipher if there was any truth to verbal Kint's testimony. This Film has stood the test of time, and can now be considered a crime thriller classic. The surprise ending, the acting, and the directing all worked in harmony to produce one of my favorite movies of all time. This movie gets a 10\/10 in my book, and should be on the list of anybody that likes good twist ending.

Basically poor young man George Eastman (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Montgomery Clift) arrives in a Chicago town, and while working in a hotel as a bellboy has a chance encounter with his wealthy industrialist uncle Charles Eastman (Herbert Heyes), he allows his nephew to visit whenever he is around, and despite the other Eastman family members seeing him as a bit on an outsider George is given a job in Charles's factory. George hopes to impress his uncle working hard, and while there he also starts dating poor and inexperienced fellow worker Alice Tripp (Golden Globe nominated Shelley Winters), she is dazed by him and doesn't really realise his family name being significant, and he does go up the corporate ladder, which include him allowed to suggest improvements to production, and his uncle impressed invites him to the family home for a social gathering. Since he arrived in town, George has been admired by society girl Angela Vickers (Dame Elizabeth Taylor), they finally meet at the party, and quickly fall in love, and escorting her propels him into the intoxicating and carefree high society lifestyle he had always been denied, and he stays with her even after Alice announces she is pregnant and expecting him to marry her, he even arranges an abortion which she does not go ahead with. George and Angela go to Loon Lake to seclude themselves and spend time together, he hears a tale of how a drowning occurred and a man's body was ever found, so he concocts a plan to get rid of Alice so he marry Angela, Alice meanwhile threatens to expose him and the pregnancy he caused while at a business event, so he leaves the family so he can deal with the situation. The next morning George and Alice try to get married at City Hall, but it is closed due to Labor Day, so he suggests they spend the day rowing on the lake, she has no suspicions of his plan, he acts visibly nervous before getting the boat, on the water Alice talks about dreams she has had of them being happy together with the child, he changes his mind about any murder plan, but she realises something is wrong, and standing up causes the boat to capsize, and she drowns while he swims to shore. Returning the Vickers lodge he is feeling tense and does not speak to anyone about what has happened, Alice's body is discovered in the water, her death is suspected as murder due to witness statements and abundant evidence, George is arrested just as he is granted permission to marry Angela by her father, although the drowning was accidental George's actions before and after the death condemn him. The District Attorney R. Frank Marlowe (Raymond Burr) acting as prosecution really grills him, and his denials are useless, in the end he is found guilty and sentenced to execution in the electric chair, George confesses he deserves it, as he wanted to kill her, so that makes just as guilty as much as if he had actually committed the crime. Also starring Anne Revere as Hannah Eastman, Keefe Brasselle as Earl Eastman, Lois Chartrand as Marsha, Fred Clark as Bellows, Shepperd Strudwick as Anthony 'Tony' Vickers and Frieda Inescort as Mrs. Ann Vickers. Clift as the young man rising in society, falling in love but brought back down again by an accident is really good, Winters is brilliant as the innocent and sympathetic other woman the leading man formerly had a relationship but unknowingly gets in his way, and young Taylor of course with lovely eyes, dark hair and big lips has never looked more beautiful, and is likable being the glamorous love interest. I don't know the origin of the film title, but the story is based on a novel called An American Tragedy, this is called one of the finest dramatic films of the 1950's, and that is definitely a suitable recommendations, it has impeccable imagery for a black and white picture, the acting and writing is great, I agree it may seem a little dated with it's love story ideas and being a little too drawn out, but it undoubtedly a gripping and splendid classic drama.

One example is Hidden Agenda, about an investigation into the murder of a human rights lawyer in Belfast. Loach not only indicts the British occupation, but also finds time to take a swipe at Margaret Thatcher's government.* While I was watching the movie I assumed that it was based on the murder of solicitor Pat Finucane. It turns out that the movie is a fictional story, but it still makes sure to show the sorts of things that had become commonplace in Northern Ireland. I read that Loach had the cast members meet with people who had gotten abused by British forces to give them an idea of what the movie was dealing with.Ken Loach also looked at Ireland in The Wind that Shakes the Barley, about Ireland's war for independence in the early 20th century. Both movies take unflinching looks at what the English did to the Irish for over 800 years. To be certain, Hidden Agenda features a scene that should give people pause in the era of the so called war on terrorism a man sings a song that has the line you take our land and call us terrorists for resisting. I recommend the movie. Other movies focusing on Northern Ireland that I recommend are In the Name of the Father, Bloody Sunday and Breakfast on Pluto.*After Thatcher died, Loach proposed that her funeral should be privatized, since she would've wanted it that way.

Eight survivors find themselves afloat on a tiny lifeboat. First on board is world-weary columnist Tallulah Bankhead (as Constance Connie Porter). She is dressed in in fur and diamonds, darling, but we later hear how Ms. Bankhead clawed her way to the top. Next up is heroically handsome leading man John Hodiak (as John Kovac). A wise seaman, Mr. Hodiak started roughly, in a Chicago slaughterhouse. These two represent debating democracy; we hope they will eventually come together. They, and the other allied survivors, are joined by a ninth man. Welcome aboard, suspicious-looking Nazi sailor Walter Slezak (as Willi). It turns out the Nazi U-boat was also destroyed, and Mr. Slezak may have been responsible...This World War II propaganda film warns us not to trust Germans or show any weakness in dealing with them. The advice wasn't bad during the war years, but hindsight reveals most wartime films as flippant and one-dimensional. Not so on this Lifeboat...Taken from an original story by John Steinbeck (which explains why the players sometimes speak like they are characters from a John Steinbeck novel), this drama holds up extraordinarily well. Despite the presence of international passengers, the cast is meant to represent the collective American immigrant experience. Note that Germany receives dual representation, when you consider wounded William Bendix (as Gus Smith). Also interesting is the way Canada Lee (as Joe Charcoal Spencer) is given the right to vote; moreover, he demonstrates how religious beliefs helped achieve freedom from slavery. The debating travelers are quite engaging. It certainly helps that they are marvelously directed by Alfred Hitchcock.

America prides itself on being the New World, modern, democratic and rational, yet the witch trials, and the superstitious, intolerant and authoritarian attitudes which produced them, seem very much of the Old World. Indeed, in some respects Americans of this period were more old-fashioned than the Mother Country. The last English witch trials had taken place ten years earlier, and by the 1690s belief in witchcraft was in decline. Arthur Miller's play The Crucible takes the witch-trials for its subject, but was also written as a critique of McCarthyism. Miller succeeded in his intention to such an extent that it is today difficult for any historian to write about the proceedings of the House Un- American Activities Committee without using the phrase witch hunt, but whether this has done the play's long-term reputation any good is another matter. McCarthyism may have been a burning issue in the fifties, but today, at least to anyone under the age of eighty, the HUAC seems nearly as remote in time as the witch trials themselves. Moreover, the parallels that Miller draws between Salem and McCarthyism are not, in my opinion, persuasive. And yet I nevertheless regard this as one of the greatest tragedies written in English in the twentieth century. It has taken on a life of its own, independent of the political concerns that prompted it, and become a timeless work which still speaks to us today, not as a satire on a long-dead politician, but as a play about injustice and the struggle against it. Miller's hero, John Proctor, is a classic flawed tragic hero, a man who becomes involved in tragedy because of his human frailties. Proctor, a prosperous farmer, has been unfaithful to his wife Elizabeth with their maidservant, Abigail Williams, but has repented of his adulterous affair and, at his wife's request, dismissed Abigail from his service. These events come back to haunt him. Abigail is the leading figure in a group of girls and young women who begin to accuse their neighbours of witchcraft and who, in the prevailing climate of superstitious Puritanism, are readily believed by the authorities. Abigail, still obsessively in love with Proctor and consumed with hatred for his wife, accuses Elizabeth Proctor, who is arrested. Proctor's attempt to prove his wife's innocence backfires, and he is himself accused and sentenced to death. Told that his life will be spared if he confesses, he faces the dilemma of either saving his life by falsely confessing to a crime, or continuing to maintain his innocence, which means that he will be hanged. A French film, Les Sorcieres de Salem, was based upon Miller's play in the fifties, but he had to wait another four decades before Hollywood plucked up the courage to follow suit. Miller himself wrote the screenplay, and Proctor is played by his son-in-law Daniel Day-Lewis. Day-Lewis is one of the most reliable screen actors in the world today; I have never seen him give a bad performance, and seldom one which is less than compelling. He is also a versatile actor who has created a gallery of memorable characters all quite different from one another, unlike some actors who play essentially the same character in every film they make. Although he is British and Irish by descent, many of his best-known characters, from Hawkeye in The Last of the Mohicans to President Lincoln, have been American, and Proctor is another. Day-Lewis makes him both proud and sensuous, but a man of integrity who will fight to retain that integrity, even at the cost of his life, in a world gone mad.The modern play closest in theme to The Crucible is, in my view, Robert Bolt's A Man for All Seasons, also inspired by real historical events and with a hero who would rather forfeit his life than tell a lie. It is therefore appropriate that Paul Scofield, who famously played Thomas More in the stage and screen versions of A Man for All Seasons, should also star in The Crucible. Here he also plays a lawyer named Thomas, but a villain rather than the hero. Judge Thomas Danforth, Proctor's nemesis and the man tasked with investigating the allegations of witchcraft, is a cold, precise, bloodless figure, the sort of lawyer who is less concerned to see justice done than to see that if injustice is done it is done according to the strict letter of the law. A third fine performance comes from Winona Ryder as the spiteful, hysterical and vindictive Abigail, reminding us of just what a fine young actress she could be at her best, even if in recent years her emotionally troubled private life has received more attention than her acting. There are also good contributions from Elizabeth Lawrence as Rebecca Nurse, an old woman who maintains her dignity despite the absurd charges that are brought against her, and Rob Campbell as John Hale, a clergyman who initially supports the witch-hunt but who has enough integrity to change his mind to when he realises that the campaign has got out of hand and become an opportunity to settle old scores. The film was directed by Nicholas Hytner, also responsible for another successful historical drama of the mid-nineties, The Madness of King George. The Crucible is not, however, made in the lavish heritage cinema style. In keeping with the Puritan aesthetic of the early Salem settlers and with the dark events which constitute its subject-matter, the look of the film is restrained and sombre. Hytner has produced a fitting adaptation of this great play. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 February 2014","score":"","review":" The Salem witch trials of 1692 have always gripped the American imagination, possibly precisely because they are something so un-American.

Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a prison drama in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word redemption is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.The Shawshank Redemption is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.
