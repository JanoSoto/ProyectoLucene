I think ever since the first full-length cartoon movies have been made, there was the funny support character which was responsible for the laughs. In later times this character was in general the hero's aide the Genie in Alladin, Philoctetes in Hercules and so on. The problem is that the funny character tends to get more and more exaggerated every time, borrowing standard and oh-so-predictable lines from poor comedies, spoiling everything. Don't get me wrong The Genie and Philoctetes were perfect, because they didn't overdo it, but Mushu certainly overdoes it. What need do we have for this kind of silly humor in a children movie? All the lines were heard and reheard, stupid and boring... and not funny at all. A movie CAN be nice without somebody telling the same old jokes over and over again, jokes which sound the same whether they are told in I-don't-know-which-century China (like in Mulan) or in the next century (like in the last semi-science-fiction movie I have seen, The Sixth Day).A cartoon movie is dedicated first of all to children, and I think that at least for them we should keep the movies nice, like the stories were when I was a kid. Why do kids these days watch mostly cartoons about bigger and bigger robots fighting each other and not Tom and Jerry anymore? We should try to change this mentality...Other than that the movie was very nice, the musical score was great and did a great job in sustaining the action.

Maybe then can I explain how this movie moved me, touched me and raised a storm in my head &#150; and became the best movie (all categories) I have ever seen, after 6 years finally pushing `Heat' down the ladder to a venerable second. I want to savor this moment. I almost want to resist. But how can one resist `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'?Set in China some time in the middle ages, two warriors, Yu Shu Lien and Li Mu Bai (Yeoh and Yun-Fat) battle an elusive enemy called the `Jade Fox' and are surprised to almost meet their match in a disciple, led astray and onto the wrong path by the Jade Fox (the Anakin-Skywalker-syndrome). The adventure revolves much around a sword that the Master warrior Li Mu Bai gives away as a gift, after deciding to give his warrior life up. But before he can give it up completely, he must face his Master's nemesis. The film is filled with stunning scenery and photography, violent and riveting martial art, a dialogue so poetic and justified it made my head spin. Refreshing and wondrous in the art of storytelling, `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' has made a profound impression on me.I am relatively new to the Hong Kong movies, and movies where martial arts play a considerable role. Therefore, I don't know how far Lee and his crew has pushed the ideas and the filming &#150; but to me, this film was so deeply compelling and spellbinding, I have a hard time imagining anything like it. It's not a `martial arts movie' &#150; it's much more of a drama, a love story and a retelling of Chinese lore. Magic is the essence, the aerial ballet of the fight scenes and the absolute control over every move in close combat, trigger and inspire a sense of wonder and adds beauty to the art of killing that Li Mu Bai is tired of. I understand that Ang Lee must have borrowed a great deal of material from Hong Kong movies, but like I said, to someone unfamiliar with those, this film appears quite revolutionary. There's poetry in every single detail the story, the dialogue, the characters and their every trait, the scenery, the camera work and, of course, the fighting &#150; violent and almost feverish.

Those films are few and far between. `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is of that special brand that not only appears flawless, but entirely perfect. I'm not saying that it is perfect &#150; I'm saying that the depth and scope of the film makes it seem so. And that is not something that happens very often, not to me anyway.

The whole idea of our world being part of someone else's imagination is something that has fascinated me for as long as I can remember.

No matter how much I tried, I couldn't bring myself to care about these characters because they just weren't real.   You would think that in a film dealing with reality-as-you-know-it crumbling around the main characters, that there would be some exploration into how the newly revealed reality affected their psyches.   But that doesn't happen here.  Instead, we are given a movie where the emphasis is placed upon stocking up on as many guns and other weapons as possible so that the bad guys can be shot and killed.   Give me a break!!!I think what has happened in these type of movies is that the producers are handed a great idea and then spend their entire budget on the actors and special effects.  They don't bother to spend anything on the screenplay because they have realized that good ones aren't necessary anymore.  Just give the public some nice CGI and they'll flock to the theatre. Unfortunately, they seem to be right.   Movies like Matrix and and the Jurassic Park series continue to sell out even though the stories are horrible.  Give us a cool CGI Dinosaur running around a city or make the lead characters do CGI kung-fu moves and we'll go home happy.   Never mind that we have absolutely no insight into who the main characters are.  We don't need to care about them as long as they are involved in computerized situations!   (Did anyone actually give a damn whether Jeff Goldblum's character lived or died in Lost World?)Anyway - my point is that you can certainly make a film exploring ideas and concepts similar to those in these mega movies and still have the audience care about the characters.In the case of Matrix, for those interested in a good reality-as-you-know-it type of movie, I would suggest Josef Rusnak's 'Thirteenth Floor' or even better yet, if you can handle sub-titles, Alejandro Amenabar's Open Your Eyes.   Both of these movies manage to give you an incredible story, with characters you will remember long after the credits have rolled.

But in time I soon realized that I was'nt just watching a good ol' regular western, but a treasure in cinematic art.After growing up seeing countless westerns like, HIGH NOON,THE WILD BUNCH,HOW THE WEST WAS WON, THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES,etc. It was clear that THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY had left more of an impact on me than the rest of the genre ever did. And now that I have watched it numerous times over the past few decades, (Theres the proof that I never get sick of watching it!) It's dawned on me that this flick will go down in history as one of the greatest masterpieces of film.So...Where to begin? First off, I knew I was in for something different when the first 15-or-so-minutes of the film opens with no dialouge. Plus the first appearance of The man with no name ,which occurs much later than everyone would be led to expect,  gives new meaning to the phrase of grand entrance. THERE'S MORE!  Lee Van Cleef's Angel Eyes is the epitome of evil..Enough to qualify him as, The Bad. But Eli Wallach's performance as Tuco aka The Ugly, is the big scene stealer!

But then what a last 20 minutes - totally blew the film for me, and I nearly choked laughing at how poor the whole thing revealed itself to be.There is so much wrong, but where to start?  The writer probably had a good idea, but that idea probably wasn't worth the bother of scripting.  I find it hard to believe that any more than one person felt it worth their while to involve themselves in this film.So - Bruce Willis is a dull security guard, with a dull wife and a demented child.  After being the sole survivor of a train crash Willis meets the odd Mr Glass who reckons Willis is a super hero.  Somehow Samuel L. Jackson's character has made a lot of money out of selling old comic books - the first evidence that this film must take place in an alternative universe!I won't spoil the twist ending for you.  It spoils the movie, so I would walk out just before Bruce is in the station in his Security cape. Really. Leave then, and you may get off lightly with the feeling of watching a quirky but dull movie.If you stay you will get more Hitchcockesqe posturing camera techniques, more music that is just plain wrong and more sulky faces from everyone on screen.What really did it for me was M.

It's no great work of art, but it is moving and sweet. I really enjoyed watching the two leading stars. Of course they're beautiful and all that, but they managed to seem human and flawed at the same time (as did the parents) and I didn't feel this movie was overly sappy at all. They seemed to talk to each other the way people do, and less like your typical Hollywood snappy dialogue. There were some interesting and touching moments, such as the contrast between what the old man thought a married couple should act and how Alec Baldwin thought they should, as he looked longingly at the couple kissing in the pool while his new wife (possessed by the old man) chatted away with an older couple.Oscar winner Kathy Bates was totally wasted here though.

The cinematography of the island, and the shots at end (which are symoblic to the story) are great and Hanks' acting talent is unreal.  I don't know how he does it, here's a guy who was basicaly a stand up comedian and a television actor, until Big hit the screen and then he ended up in great roles in films like Phillidelphia and Forest Gump.  He is the key in this film, if they got some other actor that didn't work this film would have been terrible.This being said, the film has constant 'What would you do scenarios?', throughout the entire movie, and I am not always crazy about that.  The biggest flaw I think with this film is that the trailer GIVES away the fact that Hanks gets off the island, in short the trailer TELLS you the entire movie.  This is stupid, and the director said he did this deliberatly. Second...  Hanks' return to the real world I think is VERY unrealistic and RUSHED through and perhaps even somewhat unnecessary. Basicaly he ends up back and there is literally a short scene where he is having a welcoming party with his office colleagues.  They all come up to him and say things like 'Well we see you back at the office tomorrow regarding meeting ...,  Hey how about we shoot a round of golf, I am teeing off tommorow at 8, no no no... How about...Let's spend 1 year in psychotherapy, to figure out how to live again after not interacting with humans for 4+ years This would be more the norm... and more realistic.***POSSIBLE SPOILER DON'T READ IF YOU WANT TO SEE FILM ***And thirdly, the meeting with the 'other husband' was done VERY badly, meaning it wasn't acted out or handled well.

This helped me get really attached to the characters (although much of that is, of course, due to the script and many other factors); normally when I'm watching a movie, I'm thinking well, I wonder if they're going to kill this guy off now but in Traffic I was surprised to find myself actually caring about the characters as though they were real people.One of the greatest things that I think Traffic has going for it, much moreso than other anti-drugwar films like Drugstore Cowboy, is due to the potential impact the film has on the general public.  Most drug films I've seen are very liberal and are geared towards a younger audience; I would be fairly reluctant to show Drugstore Cowboy to my 50-something mother, for example.  However, despite the fact that some say that we know everything Traffic tells us about the drug war, I think there are a lot of people who don't know everything Traffic tells us about drug war, and Traffic is the best movie to enlighten them precisely because it's so accessible to all audiences--not just to the Green Party supporters who think drugs should be legalized, but to anyone concerned about the drug war, whether they're ultra-liberal, ultra-reactionary, or somewhere in the middle.  For instance, my mother saw Traffic and said she learned a good deal from it.Another thing I liked best about the film was its sympathy (and realism) in portraying all parties involved--most of the main characters who used or trafficked drugs weren't portrayed as the no-good punks or heartless profit-mongers that the elderly have often stereotyped drug users and traffickers as, and most of the main characters who were fighting the war on drugs (particularly Michael Douglas' character) weren't the blind idiots that young liberals have often stereotyped government officials as.  Of course, such stereotypes do come from reality, so they should be in the movie to some extent, and they are but fortunately most of those stereotypes weren't the main characters that the film focused on.  Rather, they were embodied by the individuals who shaped the environment around the main characters, which I think was a great idea.Someone mentioned that they thought the idea of the valedictorian drug user was a total cliche in Hollywood, but I don't think that could be further from the truth.  Maybe I haven't seen the same drug-oriented movies as everyone else, but I can't recall a single film other than Traffic in which such intelligent and downright dorky people--people like my friends, who play trivia games answering questions about Greek playwrights on their laptop in their spare time--were avid drug users.  In my opinion (and my mother's, actually), the film's portrayal of teenage drug use was actually one of the most poignant parts of the movie.And as for those people who were disappointed that the film didn't mention the legalization of drugs I think this movie is meant to portray the problems with drugs and the drug war; it is not meant to offer solutions. Furthermore, the film would've had to be extended by at least an hour if it even delved into the issue of legalization, and moreover it probably would've freaked out conservative audience members to the point that they wouldn't listen to everything else important and eye-opening that the film had to say.  It also probably would've had to take a stance on the issue of legalization if it brought it up, and since legalization is about as touchy a topic as abortion or euthanasia, it's probably a good idea that the film didn't address it.  Taking a stance on such an issue would've undoubtedly branded the film as being either liberal or conservative and in my opinion, the greatest asset of Traffic is that it essentially denies itself a political stance, which is a rarity amongst drug-themed films.

Maybe I haven't seen the same drug-oriented movies as everyone else, but I can't recall a single film other than Traffic in which such intelligent and downright dorky people--people like my friends, who play trivia games answering questions about Greek playwrights on their laptop in their spare time--were avid drug users.  In my opinion (and my mother's, actually), the film's portrayal of teenage drug use was actually one of the most poignant parts of the movie.And as for those people who were disappointed that the film didn't mention the legalization of drugs I think this movie is meant to portray the problems with drugs and the drug war; it is not meant to offer solutions. Furthermore, the film would've had to be extended by at least an hour if it even delved into the issue of legalization, and moreover it probably would've freaked out conservative audience members to the point that they wouldn't listen to everything else important and eye-opening that the film had to say.  It also probably would've had to take a stance on the issue of legalization if it brought it up, and since legalization is about as touchy a topic as abortion or euthanasia, it's probably a good idea that the film didn't address it.  Taking a stance on such an issue would've undoubtedly branded the film as being either liberal or conservative and in my opinion, the greatest asset of Traffic is that it essentially denies itself a political stance, which is a rarity amongst drug-themed films.

Sure the outlandish fighting scenes are there (in a way never seen before), and the lost article and avenging hero is in place, but this is so very different.  The visuals are so brilliant that one walks out of the darkened theater and the bright lights don't seem that bright.  This film leaves you with a glow that only a few films can. It isn't a perfect film, none are, but it is an important film.  This will do for Asian Films, what Pulp Fiction did for English speaking films.

In polls asking citizens about their main concerns, taxes, jobs, and the economy top the list while drugs are seldom mentioned.  Perhaps this is because of the national drop in crime. Nevertheless, the problem is still with us, and this film is a sobering look of how embedded drugs are in our culture.  Even `nice' people, suburban youngsters in affluent homes, are addicts (who we call `recreational users').  The movie, without preaching, shows us the difficulties of eradication.  The profits are huge, the marketers are far better motivated and financed than the enforcers, the users can often be children of affluent Americans, and the `highs' experienced are euphoric.   We're reluctant to prosecute our own children and to call them addicts.Several stories are cleverly interwoven for dramatic impact and visual variety.  Michael Douglas, in another strong performance, is appointed U.S. drug czar in a high-profile `war on drugs.'  His daughter, an over-achieving student, and her friends, often get high on free-base cocaine.  In a fast-paced and well-edited story that takes us to Tijuana, Mexico City, Washington and Middle America, we see all facets of the trade and how money, sex, corruption, intimidation, politics, race and ecstasy are intertwined. There are about a dozen major characters we meet and get to know.  Many are deplorable, but have redeeming qualities that make them real.  The movie shows us the breadth of the problem, and how its eradication would not only rid us of traffickers, but also deprive young people of a pleasure source, and the marginally employed of income.  I can't say I knew every character's motivation at all times, but the totality hangs together very well in conveying this message.

He has a cast that ranges from quite good to excellent, a setting that almost defies description in terms of cool, and even a decent storyline and premise.In fact, there is only the one problem with this film, and (though not spoiling anything) I will sum it up the ending. Take it from me - as soon as Evelyn Stockard Price (Famke Janssen) responds to her husband Steven Price's (Geoffrey Rush) urgings to Get up, turn off this film. You'll be much happier wondering just what happened than seeing what actually *does* happen.With that warning in mind, here is why disregarding that warning will bring nothing but disappointment. The premise of the film is that millionaire Steven Price throws a birthday party with a twist for his estranged wife, Evelyn. Shredding her list of guests, he writes one of his own, packed with people so hungry for money they'd kill for it. The problem is, when the guests show up at the House on Haunted Hill - the former Vannacutt Institute for the Criminally Insane - none of them are known to Steven or his wife.Along with Watson Pritchett (Chris Kattan, doing a marvellous job), who owns the house, the four guests find themselves trapped inside with the Prices when the lockdown mechanism from the house's days as an asylum is mysteriously activated. Pritchett's reaction to this is extreme - not surprising when you consider that the place had burnt out in the 1930s after the inmates revolted against Dr. Benjamin Vannacutt's inhuman practices and set the place on fire. Turns out that his father had been killed while restoring the house - when challenged over his statement that it had just been an accident, he memorably retorts I lied. The house is alive. We're all going to die.This is a gorgeous set. There are two parts to the house - the restored levels above the ground and the unrestored basement. The restored sections enhance the American gothic style of the film, previously evoked in a beautiful re-imagining of the original opening sequence from William Castle's film. The unrestored sections are a nightmare of twisting corridors and disused medical equipment, and wheelchairs are to be found *everywhere* - for, it seems, no reason at all. Their presence is subtly ominous.Geoffrey Rush definitely steals the show in this film - his introductory sequence with Lisa Loeb and, happily, James Marsters, at the opening of the newest Price Amusements rollercoaster is wildly funny. He has a great chemistry, too, with Famke Janssen, especially in the scenes lifted from the William Castle original. Janssen shines herself, especially later on after a suprising revelation. As mentioned before, Chris Kattan is great, but the other four actors do very well with what they're given.The script is good when it comes to the Prices and Watson Pritchett, and adequate when dealing with the two heroes of the film, while the others are rather shortchanged - but not without reason. There's no real complaints apart from the extremely terrible ending. A final word about that ending Should you sit through it, PLEASE stay and watch until the end of the credits. You will NOT be sorry. Even if you stop the tape or DVD and fast-forward to the end of the credits when Evelyn Price gets up, you'll enjoy it.Bottom line - see this film. It's really quite good, despite the ending, and you'll have a good time marvelling at the sets and enjoying Rush's, Janssen's and Kattan's performances.

","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"9 January 2001","score":"","review":"  William Malone has made, in remaking William Castle's original House on Haunted Hill, possibly one of the most spectacularly ambitious failures in the history of cinema - certainly in horror cinema. He has a cast that ranges from quite good to excellent, a setting that almost defies description in terms of cool, and even a decent storyline and premise.In fact, there is only the one problem with this film, and (though not spoiling anything) I will sum it up the ending. Take it from me - as soon as Evelyn Stockard Price (Famke Janssen) responds to her husband Steven Price's (Geoffrey Rush) urgings to Get up, turn off this film. You'll be much happier wondering just what happened than seeing what actually *does* happen.With that warning in mind, here is why disregarding that warning will bring nothing but disappointment. The premise of the film is that millionaire Steven Price throws a birthday party with a twist for his estranged wife, Evelyn. Shredding her list of guests, he writes one of his own, packed with people so hungry for money they'd kill for it. The problem is, when the guests show up at the House on Haunted Hill - the former Vannacutt Institute for the Criminally Insane - none of them are known to Steven or his wife.Along with Watson Pritchett (Chris Kattan, doing a marvellous job), who owns the house, the four guests find themselves trapped inside with the Prices when the lockdown mechanism from the house's days as an asylum is mysteriously activated. Pritchett's reaction to this is extreme - not surprising when you consider that the place had burnt out in the 1930s after the inmates revolted against Dr. Benjamin Vannacutt's inhuman practices and set the place on fire. Turns out that his father had been killed while restoring the house - when challenged over his statement that it had just been an accident, he memorably retorts I lied. The house is alive. We're all going to die.This is a gorgeous set. There are two parts to the house - the restored levels above the ground and the unrestored basement. The restored sections enhance the American gothic style of the film, previously evoked in a beautiful re-imagining of the original opening sequence from William Castle's film. The unrestored sections are a nightmare of twisting corridors and disused medical equipment, and wheelchairs are to be found *everywhere* - for, it seems, no reason at all. Their presence is subtly ominous.Geoffrey Rush definitely steals the show in this film - his introductory sequence with Lisa Loeb and, happily, James Marsters, at the opening of the newest Price Amusements rollercoaster is wildly funny. He has a great chemistry, too, with Famke Janssen, especially in the scenes lifted from the William Castle original. Janssen shines herself, especially later on after a suprising revelation. As mentioned before, Chris Kattan is great, but the other four actors do very well with what they're given.The script is good when it comes to the Prices and Watson Pritchett, and adequate when dealing with the two heroes of the film, while the others are rather shortchanged - but not without reason. There's no real complaints apart from the extremely terrible ending. A final word about that ending Should you sit through it, PLEASE stay and watch until the end of the credits. You will NOT be sorry. Even if you stop the tape or DVD and fast-forward to the end of the credits when Evelyn Price gets up, you'll enjoy it.Bottom line - see this film. It's really quite good, despite the ending, and you'll have a good time marvelling at the sets and enjoying Rush's, Janssen's and Kattan's performances.

The musical numbers totally destroy the films mood, and Bjork is forced to sing with actors WHO ARE NOT SINGERS!!  It was so drawn out, predictable, and absurd.  The film went downhill SO fast, they make her a ridiculous tragic character beyond belief.  Also when Selma is suppose to be at peak blindness, she still makes eye contact when she's talking to people (yeah that's believable).They OVERLY demonize her character in the courtroom, for the only purpose of which I think is to make everyone who saw this film think in absurdity. Now Bjork was good in the film (with what little she could do to save this garbage), and I do like her singing.  She has a powerful voice and I enjoy some of her work a lot, BUT this film's story and drawn out premise is ridiculous, and goes on to long.  This movie is also SO PREDICTABLE from beginning to end.  By the time we got to the courtroom I kept saying to myself, JUST KILL HER ALREADY...  I felt nothing for her and wanted her dead like all the other people who made this junk.  It's no wonder people at Cannes were booing when they gave the Palm D'or award for this, now that's a tragedy.Rating 2 out of 10  ","genre":null},{"date":"9 January 2001","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Without explaining to much of the plot behind this idiotic film this is what I can say.This movie INSULTED my intelligence.
