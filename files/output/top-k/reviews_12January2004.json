Andbeing able to discuss something after you've seen it doesn't necessarily make it  good. What Richard Kelly does is give us an entertaining, scary and stylish one  hour and forty minutes.The central character is a boy named Donnie Darko, a boy troubled by visionsof a large rabbit who tells him the world is going to end in 28 days. The rabbit is  a wonderful demonic image with a voice to chill you to the bone. His name isFrank. Nothing in Donnie Darko will be as you think it should. Kelly, who wrote  and directed the film, creates a sinister setting out of an ordinary suburban  neighbourhood. It's a surprising and challenging debut from a clearly talented  director. The only problem I did have with this picture was that it left youscratching your head constantly. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't mind having  to think when I'm watching a film, but I felt we needed some kind of closure at  the end &#150; what we get is a twist which just leaves us with more head scratching  to do.

An easy enough story;  4 people getting involved with drugs under different circumstances, all hoping to be 'W-I-N-N-E-R-S'.  The catch  Nobody wins.  The story is actually handled well initially.  Everybody's role is established.  The hopeful young couple. The friend with a one-track mind.  The naive and lonely old woman. Through drugs, all of them get more power.  Harry (Leto) and Ty (Wayans) make a lot of money, Sara (Burstyn) has boosted self-esteem & confidence, and Marion (Connelly) simply has control of her life & herself for once (as seen by her handling of the Shrink).  The first half of the movie is their HIGH, the second half is their big fall.  Harry and Ty lose their money and are mere pawns of the underworld, Marion is under the mercy of the Shrink and Big Tim, while Sara just unravels.  It's like a train wreck, but surely the movie is more than that?  Or at least I had hoped.Now, onto the acting\/characters.  Ellen Burstyn is fantastic as Sara, and you really get to feel for her because you know a little bit about her and what's she's been through, and what she really wants and dreams of being. Leto, Connelly, and Wayans are really good in their roles too, but I just got didn't get enough of them (not in the good sense).  Just flat-out weak character development.  Harry is a dopey kid with a generally good heart, but we don't get much more than that.  Certainly not enough to really sympathize for what he's about to go through.  But, Oronosky and Selby do a good job with one scene in particular where Marion is on the pier, clearly symbolic of the only thing pure in Harry's life, if only for a short while. Drugs stand in Harry and Marion's way, but nobody does enough to make that connection evident.  Speaking of Marion, again they sort of touch on the fact that she was a victim of abuse (the nightmare, Hell, drugging up at the sight of her own body, The Shrink, etc.), but you never really know and you're left with nothing to do except move on with the story and in several instances, pretend to care more than you actually do.  This is also evident when things go from bad to worse and everyone changes.  Ty has even less development, as they briefly go over his relationship with his mother near the beginning and futilely at the end, but it seems all too rushed, and Oronosky and Selby appear to just want to tie up all the loose ends in a neat little bow with his particular fate.  Too much focus elsewhere and not enough on good old fashioned character development, which then hurts the plot itself because it IS the characters and not much more.The directing was original, but almost overbearing at times as I said, the techniques almost getting in the way of the actual performances (I mean, we get it, there's something wrong.).  But that's not to say that Oronosky's work wasn't clever or smart, because it was.  I just feel that director's style should totally gel with all the actors, as opposed to one taking away from the other.  So, Requiem ends up being the train wreck that was expected, but you really only feel for a couple of the passengers, one for the horrific things she puts herself through to get a fix, and the other because you're human and so is she, but a little more misguided than you and I and not fit to be in her son's world.  There should be more sympathy towards them, which was what Oronosky\/Selby wanted, but I dug down and found nothing.It's a good movie, but I don't get the rating.

As silly as that sounds, the movie really got our imaginations going. Of course you grow up and you forget a little bit about the movies that you used to watch as a kid. But I was looking at the five dollar bin at Wal Mart and found The Secret Garden, I figured since I hadn't seen it in a while that I could check it out once again and still I think I have a special love for this magical story about bringing life back into a dead world.The recently-orphaned Mary Lennox travels from her home in India to her uncle Archibald Craven's hundred-room house, Misselthwaite Manor. Mary, materially spoiled but emotionally neglected by her late parents, is rather unpleasant and unhappy in her new surroundings. Martha, a Yorkshire girl working as a maid, and her brother Dicken, a boy who can talk to animals, befriend and help her to heal and grow. She discovers her deceased aunt's secret garden, which has been locked for ten years and enlists Dickon to help her bring it to life. Hidden away in the gloomy house is Mary's cousin Colin, who has been treated all his life like a fragile, sickly invalid. This exaggeration has augmented what smaller problems he did have, turning him into a demanding, short-tempered, helpless boy. Mary, defying the orders of Mrs Medlock, discovers Colin and is taken aback by his disposition, but reaches out to him anyway. Soon Colin, Mary, and Dickon all spend their time in the secret garden. They perform magic, and make the garden live again.The Secret Garden is always going to hold a special place in my heart, I absolutely adore this film and it brings back so many wonderful memories from my childhood. The children that they found to play Mary, Dicken and Colin were absolutely perfect and were great actors actually, I'm surprised they didn't move onto bigger things in their careers, but they had great chemistry and really brought the movie to life. The settings are gorgeous, the garden that the children created was so lovely and reminds me about all the wonderful things that spring brings, life.

But I was looking at the five dollar bin at Wal Mart and found The Secret Garden, I figured since I hadn't seen it in a while that I could check it out once again and still I think I have a special love for this magical story about bringing life back into a dead world.The recently-orphaned Mary Lennox travels from her home in India to her uncle Archibald Craven's hundred-room house, Misselthwaite Manor. Mary, materially spoiled but emotionally neglected by her late parents, is rather unpleasant and unhappy in her new surroundings. Martha, a Yorkshire girl working as a maid, and her brother Dicken, a boy who can talk to animals, befriend and help her to heal and grow. She discovers her deceased aunt's secret garden, which has been locked for ten years and enlists Dickon to help her bring it to life. Hidden away in the gloomy house is Mary's cousin Colin, who has been treated all his life like a fragile, sickly invalid. This exaggeration has augmented what smaller problems he did have, turning him into a demanding, short-tempered, helpless boy. Mary, defying the orders of Mrs Medlock, discovers Colin and is taken aback by his disposition, but reaches out to him anyway. Soon Colin, Mary, and Dickon all spend their time in the secret garden. They perform magic, and make the garden live again.The Secret Garden is always going to hold a special place in my heart, I absolutely adore this film and it brings back so many wonderful memories from my childhood. The children that they found to play Mary, Dicken and Colin were absolutely perfect and were great actors actually, I'm surprised they didn't move onto bigger things in their careers, but they had great chemistry and really brought the movie to life. The settings are gorgeous, the garden that the children created was so lovely and reminds me about all the wonderful things that spring brings, life. If you haven't seen The Secret Garden, I highly recommend that you do, it's a very special film that I'm sure you'll fall in love with as well.8\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Family, Fantasy"},{"date":"12 January 2004","score":"13 out of 17 people found the following review useful","review":" Ah, the many memories I have with The Secret Garden, I have to admit it, when I was a kid, I had this group of girlfriends and we always thought it would be so cool if we discovered a garden just like the children in this movie did.

So if you don't wish to have the movie spoilt, stop reading now!Meet Lola. She's the one with the bright red hair and disgruntled look on her face. See her yet? Yeah, not hard to miss. Meet Manni, Lola's boyfriend. He's the thuggish looking one with the tattoos and confused look on his face. Spotted him too? Good. Manni's in a bit of trouble, which means that Lola is going to be in trouble. It's time to get used to the domino effect idea, because it's the basis of our story line. Manni is in strife because he owes Ronnie (just look for the bald guy with the evil look on his face), 100,000 Marks. Unfortunately for Manni, a bum has that money. Manni needs the money in 20 minutes or he's going to hold up a supermarket to get the money. Lola needs Manni, so therefore she needs money in 20 minutes. Lola's Dad has money, Lola's Dad has a mistress, Lola's Mum has alcohol, the security guard has a heart attack, and the bank tellers have S&M, whilst Ronnie has a very convincing evil grin.Feeling confused? You should be. This film doesn't only aim to appeal to audiences, but also aims to make them sit in the cinema scratching their heads. It isn't all bad; Director Tom Tykwer lets his audience see the story three times. Granted there are subtle differences each time. In any case, if you walk out of the movie feeling like you need to have your brain syringed, you won't be the only one!With so much confusion, one would hope that there is some kind of deep and meaningful reason for this visual attack that puts Baz Luhrmann to shame. And there is. Along with the camera angles that have been technically termed `Drug Induced', Tykwer hints to messages dealing with fate and destiny, chance and time. Don't worry, you're not spoon-fed these, so if you don't want to think whilst watching the movie, you don't have to!The most symbolic sections of the movie are the `red' scenes. How does a guy who has spent the entire movie pressing every button on the side of his video camera, add meaning to it? Have the two main actors lying in bed talking about life, the universe and everything else, whilst someone holds a piece of red cellophane over the camera lens. Obvious, wasn't it? This is surprisingly effective. Not only does Tykwer give us a chance to blink, you are also able to draw your eyes away from Lola's hair. In any case, we are left with thought provoking questions from these scenes. Is reality really real? Do the relationships we have, hold any meaning? Does fate control us, or do we control fate? Doesn't Lola's Dad look like Agent Smith from `The Matrix'? Most of these questions are answered in the `red' scenes, which are, unlike the rest of the movie, direct shots taken from above the two actors. This technique is used for contrast. It's quite entertaining to see that Tykwer can actually hold a camera still, an amazing feat, considering the `home theatre' style filming of the only other &#145;calm' section of the movie, those involving Agent Smith, I mean Lola's Dad.You can excuse me for taking some `trava-calm' before these scenes. With jerky camera motions, you feel as if you're a fly on the wall looking into the sordid life of Lola's Dad. I have nothing against this. `Yay voyeurism' and all that. Personally, I'll take `Survivor' if I want reality T.V. For some reason, I think having half the audience woozy may not have been number one on Tykwer's list of goals. The calm scenes are in great contrast to the other scenes in the film. The providing a startling counterpoint to the otherwise manic fashion of the movie. The other point of the calm scenes is that there is acting. Tykwer startles us all by having real, `true to life' acting from both Lola's father and his mistress.Now, I've made a few references to the manic way that this movie is filmed. Is it manic! I mean, if you thought that a ferret on pixie stix directed Moulin Rouge, I'd hate to imagine what kind of tripping animal was behind the camera in this movie! (An Ocelot on LSD perhaps?) In any case, Tykwer's visual onslaught is mind blowing. The cinematography in this movie has everything! There's animation, shifts between perspectives, photographic essays, this is a film with the lot! Each different style lends it self to Tykwer's themes (remember them? Fate, Destiny and all that?)Now the one thing that I haven't mentioned is the soundtrack. It's loud, it's techno, and it's brilliant. That's it. I'm not going to elaborate on that, the soundtrack was great.Okay, crunch time My final opinion. This was a good movie. It was a strange movie. It was a confusing movie, but it was very good. Tykwer has put in more twists and turns than most `Young and the Restless' episodes. The quirky nature of its structure is brilliant. There are references to time, destiny and fate. Acting, when it's there, is outstanding, whilst Lola, well&#133; She can run! Tykwer's achieved what he has set out to, a powerful movie, which is clever, thought provoking and visually amazing.

Meet Manni, Lola's boyfriend. He's the thuggish looking one with the tattoos and confused look on his face. Spotted him too? Good. Manni's in a bit of trouble, which means that Lola is going to be in trouble. It's time to get used to the domino effect idea, because it's the basis of our story line. Manni is in strife because he owes Ronnie (just look for the bald guy with the evil look on his face), 100,000 Marks. Unfortunately for Manni, a bum has that money. Manni needs the money in 20 minutes or he's going to hold up a supermarket to get the money. Lola needs Manni, so therefore she needs money in 20 minutes. Lola's Dad has money, Lola's Dad has a mistress, Lola's Mum has alcohol, the security guard has a heart attack, and the bank tellers have S&M, whilst Ronnie has a very convincing evil grin.Feeling confused? You should be. This film doesn't only aim to appeal to audiences, but also aims to make them sit in the cinema scratching their heads. It isn't all bad; Director Tom Tykwer lets his audience see the story three times. Granted there are subtle differences each time. In any case, if you walk out of the movie feeling like you need to have your brain syringed, you won't be the only one!With so much confusion, one would hope that there is some kind of deep and meaningful reason for this visual attack that puts Baz Luhrmann to shame. And there is. Along with the camera angles that have been technically termed `Drug Induced', Tykwer hints to messages dealing with fate and destiny, chance and time. Don't worry, you're not spoon-fed these, so if you don't want to think whilst watching the movie, you don't have to!The most symbolic sections of the movie are the `red' scenes. How does a guy who has spent the entire movie pressing every button on the side of his video camera, add meaning to it? Have the two main actors lying in bed talking about life, the universe and everything else, whilst someone holds a piece of red cellophane over the camera lens. Obvious, wasn't it? This is surprisingly effective. Not only does Tykwer give us a chance to blink, you are also able to draw your eyes away from Lola's hair. In any case, we are left with thought provoking questions from these scenes. Is reality really real? Do the relationships we have, hold any meaning? Does fate control us, or do we control fate? Doesn't Lola's Dad look like Agent Smith from `The Matrix'? Most of these questions are answered in the `red' scenes, which are, unlike the rest of the movie, direct shots taken from above the two actors. This technique is used for contrast. It's quite entertaining to see that Tykwer can actually hold a camera still, an amazing feat, considering the `home theatre' style filming of the only other &#145;calm' section of the movie, those involving Agent Smith, I mean Lola's Dad.You can excuse me for taking some `trava-calm' before these scenes. With jerky camera motions, you feel as if you're a fly on the wall looking into the sordid life of Lola's Dad. I have nothing against this. `Yay voyeurism' and all that. Personally, I'll take `Survivor' if I want reality T.V. For some reason, I think having half the audience woozy may not have been number one on Tykwer's list of goals. The calm scenes are in great contrast to the other scenes in the film. The providing a startling counterpoint to the otherwise manic fashion of the movie. The other point of the calm scenes is that there is acting. Tykwer startles us all by having real, `true to life' acting from both Lola's father and his mistress.Now, I've made a few references to the manic way that this movie is filmed. Is it manic! I mean, if you thought that a ferret on pixie stix directed Moulin Rouge, I'd hate to imagine what kind of tripping animal was behind the camera in this movie! (An Ocelot on LSD perhaps?) In any case, Tykwer's visual onslaught is mind blowing. The cinematography in this movie has everything! There's animation, shifts between perspectives, photographic essays, this is a film with the lot! Each different style lends it self to Tykwer's themes (remember them? Fate, Destiny and all that?)Now the one thing that I haven't mentioned is the soundtrack. It's loud, it's techno, and it's brilliant. That's it. I'm not going to elaborate on that, the soundtrack was great.Okay, crunch time My final opinion. This was a good movie. It was a strange movie. It was a confusing movie, but it was very good. Tykwer has put in more twists and turns than most `Young and the Restless' episodes. The quirky nature of its structure is brilliant. There are references to time, destiny and fate. Acting, when it's there, is outstanding, whilst Lola, well&#133; She can run! Tykwer's achieved what he has set out to, a powerful movie, which is clever, thought provoking and visually amazing. If you haven't seen this movie already, get up and go hire it. Go on. Stop reading and start walking! Otherwise, I'm sure you'll agree with me that this movie rocked.

Is this one scene enough to pass off the rest of the 2 and a half hours of the film? The answer is no. Just because one scene is technically brilliant, does not mean that somehow the entire film has justifiably earned the right to be called one of the greatest war films of all time. But again and again, whenever i hear this film being discussed, the only scene that comes up is the first 25 minute invasion sequence.The rest of this film was personally to me, a total wasted opportunity. For one thing, how was it possible for hanks and his 1950's ww2 cliched troupe, to casually stroll through a french field? This early into d-day,  the bocage areas around france were still full of threatening german units, long from being reduced.

That last battle scene was something straight out of a sgt. rock comic. Wave after wave of germans just run into fire, not taking defensive positions until about 2\/3 of them are lying dead in the normandy sun. Somehow hanks and his buddies always seemingly dance their way out of oncoming bullets. The machine gunner in the tiger was seemingly to high on hashish to fire at the americans. There is also no way in hell a sticky bomb would take the treads off of a tiger. And why the hell did all the german troops have shaved heads???

But whether you like him or not, it's definitely worth seeing and appreciating his films, and Dancer in the Dark is no exception. It was my first taste of this eccentric Danish director.Von Trier's direction can best be described as innovative; it's provocative, to a large extent experimental and very very unique. In this film, his hand-held digital camera work, some would argue, is designed to give the whole film a naturalistic look; if the camera moves in the same way that a person would in the situations created, it makes us more involved, captivates us more. I disagree. All it seems to do is make one frequently conscious of what is going on, and for that reason it has, in fact, the opposite effect, makes everything seem artificial. And as such I have a lot of difficulty getting emotionally involved in this film.Another point worth noting about Dancer in the Dark is that it is a very unconventional musical, as several times the emotions of the characters are illustrated by way of a song. This is because the lead character, played by Bjork, grew up and lived on musicals, because 'nothing terrible ever happens in them'. So therefore despite her disabling disease which rapidly destroys her eyesight, she remains positive by following the time-honoured advice of Julie Andrews et al. by singing to forget one's troubles. The film shows that this doesn't always work. It really does pile on the sorrow and darkness; It is absolutely stocked to the gills with injustice, depression, hopelessness. Obviously this is another reason why it's hard to truly like this film.Although, despite this difficulty I have relating and enjoying this film, I have to admit it's very good. It really does challenge the viewer, and challenge the film-making world in general. It's obvious to me that Von Trier's major intention in this was to experiment with and bend the rules of genre. In this case, he takes the frankly quite sappy musical genre and laces it with darkness. One clear example is when Bjork is imprisoned for murder and she cheers herself up by singing My Favourite Things in a slightly minor key. It gives an almost Joycean quality to Von Trier's harsh appropriation. And the fact is that, given that film is a visual art, if the audience can see what you were trying to do, then you've succeeded. So regardless of whether I like this film or Von Trier himself, he has managed to create a real work of art here.Finally, one thing you have to say for Lars is that he has an uncanny knack for assembling excellent casts, and doing brilliant things with them. The experimentation and challenging quality of this film would be enough to really rise hatred in me, if it weren't for the cast. Bjork absolutely shines in the lead role. It's the sort of leading performance that nobody could have played better. And not only that but she's almost upstaged by a similarly awesome performance by David Morse. One of the most under-appreciated actors around today, I personally think he gives the performance of his career in this film. He is, to put it simply, perfect in a slightly cruel, embittered but ultimately very sympathetic role. And meanwhile, there is also some further amazing support work from Catherine Deneuve, Peter Stormare and a bunch of Von Trier mainstays Jean-Marc Barr, Siobhan Fallon, Zeljko Ivanek and of course, Udo Kier in a brief but memorable cameo.Essentially the film is difficult to get into, difficult to enjoy and so easy to detest, but overall an amazing achievement in the world of film-making, and the wonderful cast more than makes up for the otherwise quite alienating direction.

However, watching this film on the big screen gave me an idea what it must have been like. Of course, there is more to the film than the famous lunar landing itself. Its a wonderful tale of the role played by the dish in Parkes, Australia. Images where being transmitted via two main dishes - the Parkes dish covered the times when the Moon was only in range of the southern hemisphere.This is a wonderful character film which demonstrates the pride felt by the people of Parkes and the professionalism of those at the dish. Its not all plain sailing though - as the dish is affected by a power surge which causes them to lose the link with Apollo 11 for a time.

Every time the woman warps back in time to try to save his abused wife she mucks it up somehow and has to keep on trying it over and over again. A really funny part is where Belushi finds out that his wife has been cheating on him and pulls a gun on her while they are in the car driving around. After they pull over she pleads with him not to hurt her as he looks all doubtful and crazy at her while holding the gun near her face. Suddenly and without prior notice as to what's happening he pulls the trigger and you get to see the back of her head spew out a tuft of hair as a bullet flies through the back of her face! The most comical part of the whole movie is when James Belushi, his abused wife, and the time warping blonde woman get pulled over by a cop and all hell breaks loose when the woman announces that Belushi's character is carrying a gun. He ends up shooting the cop and turns around to see his wife frantically speeding away in the car they were just in. He shouts something along the lines of  NO, RAYANNE, STOP, WAIT, I LOVE YOU! and immediately starts shooting wildly at the car for fear that he'll lose her and ends up hitting the gas tank on the car and sends it up in a giant ball of flames. He sees what happens and cries...MY BABY...! and then turns to the blonde woman and says YOU KILLED HER, YOU BI***! and starts to rough her up! James Belushi deserves a definate award for that role. I think it is so funny because of the way Belushi's face looks during these intense moments of the movie. He is a good comedian in this one and this movie should be classified with the comedy category.

And why shouldn't it? It was directed by the same guy who did the first two, and it really is the last gasp of that school of trouble-in-suburban-paradise Hollywood pictures. This one's not set in the suburbs, but rather on the rocky, windswept Maine coast; still, all the requisite elements are there--the BIG BEAUTIFUL EXPENSIVE HOUSE, the HAUNTING TRAGEDY FROM THE PAST, the ANGELIC NEW FRIEND\/SURROGATE PARENT\/LOVER\/BABYSITTER appearing on the scene (with an ominous, overdone score tipping us off about his or her TRUE NATURE), the WELL-MEANING-BUT-DUMB-AS-STUMPS LOVED ONES who don't realize the truth until the NICK OF TIME, etc. The list goes on and on. This time it's little pop-eyed Elijah Wood who's the only sane person in the world, left with dull relatives after widowed dad David Morse (whose appearance amounts to little more than a cameo) high-tails it for Japan, and pop icon Macauley Culkin is the blandly blond cherub with Satan's heart. Culkin's actually not at all bad in this (even if his lipstick's a bit heavy), and we come away wishing that he had been able to overcome his 'Home Alone' association (and keep his sh*t together in his personal life) enough to still have a career. Wood, on the other hand, may have grown up to be a passable actor, but here he does little more than squeak his lines, usually with a look suggesting he's just taken it in the small of the back with a cow taser. Quinn Culkin has literally none of her brother's screen presence--in fact, I barely remember her speaking--but we do feel bad for her when the little rat pushes her onto the ice. From their acting, the actors playing the parents seem to think they're in an antihistamine commercial, or maybe one for Campbell's soup.I don't mean to suggest I went into this movie expecting it to be good, but the problem is it really isn't entertainingly bad either. And it refuses to commit, too. Don't get me wrong, it's plenty unpleasant (in the knee-jerk way these pictures always are), but it never takes its ugliness to the next level.

So the parents think that ELIJAH is actually the dangerously disturbed one--it's okay, because all they do is send him to his room, basically. Then, after the hasty, melodramatic, and disturbingly hollow climax, we are treated to a delightful image of a little broken body down there on the rocks; as far as dead-child-movie-moments go, it ranks right up there with poor Piggy's demise in the 1990 remake of 'Lord of the Flies.'

He imagines himself to be 'Fred', ordinary jazz musician with a beautiful wife named Renee. Renee is cheating on him, and Fred tries to maintain the belief that he's in a normal relationship. When he makes love to her, however, her disinterest is so blatant that his psyche picks up on it -- in steps the face of his devil's advocate-conscience, Mystery Man. Meanwhile he gets these mysterious tapes (made by the Mystery Man), in which at first little happens but gradually Fred's denial breaks down and sees what Mystery Man has documented Fred murders his wife in gruesome fashion. Fred dislikes Mystery Man, but the latter tells him, You invited me. It is not my custom to go where I am not wanted.The insane deathrow inmate actually has two fantasies. In the second one he reinvents himself into a young innocent mechanic named Pete. He also turns his disinterested brunette wife into a platinum blonde named Alice. Alice is Mr. Eddy's girl but she's secretly in love with Pete. Alice and Pete want to run away together. Naturally this fantasy breaks down too, in grand fashion.Somewhere in the first half of the movie Fred says, I like to remember things my own way. That's one way to put it, Fred.
