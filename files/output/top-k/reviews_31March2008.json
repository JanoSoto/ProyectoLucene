Whether this remains the case, we will have to wait and see, but if it does stay that way then hopes are high after an impressively enjoyable first outing like this one. Yes, it's a remake (and a remake of one of my favourites from the 50s) but it's one of the better remakes of recent years.The plot sees Stephen Price (played by Geoffrey Rush, in top form) invite a bunch of people to his wife's (Famke Janssen) birthday party at the titular house. Chris Kattan is on hand to provide exposition and extra jitters while the party guests (Ali Larter, Taye Diggs, Bridgette Wilson and Peter Gallagher) provide an extra mystery to be uncovered as they turn out to be completely different to those invited. As night falls, the house (formerly a sanitarium\/hospital building) is closed up tighter than a duck's bottom with steel shutters sliding into place and potentially only one way out. That way, unfortunately, involves a shuffling off the mortal coil, usually helped by the ghosts (with the main one portrayed by the great Jeffrey Combs) of the house or the darkness that starts to fill the atmosphere.There are some dodgy practical effects in this movie but there are also some cracking moments that more than make up for that. The movie never really scares you but does provide the kind of fun thrills that the 50s movie it's based on also did so well. A great soundtrack helps (with Marilyn Manson's cover of Sweet Dreams being a highlight), the performances are in the spirit of things, some nice ideas are played out well and eagle-eyed viewers should look out for Lisa Loeb, James Marsters and Slavitza Jovan (respectively a singer, Spike from Buffy and Gozer from Ghostbusters) if you like to catch cameos.Take it in the spirit intended and you should find yourself having a brisk, fun 90 minutes. Which is, I like to think, all that Dark Castle wants to provide.See this if you like House On Haunted Hill, Thirteen Ghosts, April Fool's Day.

The view then plunges downward, through the turf and into the muck below, where monstrous beetles battle and screech -- beneath the Norman Rockwell suburbia lies ugliness and violence . This pretty much captures what the film is going to explore. The film follows Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan), who discovers a human ear in grass field and proceeds to investigate the case, with the assistance of his girlfriend, the All-American gal Sandy (Laura Dern). It is revealed the ear belongs to the kidnapped husband of a nightclub singer named Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini); Dorothy's husband and young son have been kidnapped by a man named Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), who's holding them, it appears, as a way to control Dorothy, whom he brutalizes sexually. The deeper Jeffrey digs into the mystery, the closer he becomes to both Sandy and Dorothy and eventually finds he's gotten in over his head, his adventure culminating with a terrifying late-night joy ride with Frank and his minions, and a violent, disturbing resolution.Blue Velvet is such an unsettling, disturbing film because Lynch keeps the audience in a constant state of anxiety and fear. We enter the plot through a side door -- the kidnapping has happened already, we don't understand why it's happened, we don't understand the way Dorothy is reacting to it, we don't know who Frank is or even why he's so dangerous (unexplained business regarding Frank, a dirty cop and a drug deal turned deadly only add to the sense that we're actually taking part in a subplot, not the main story). We experience everything through Jeffrey, accepting at face-value that he's a good, clean lad who just wants to try his hand at a little Hardy Boys sleuthing. But once we've identified with him, Jeffrey turns out to be a voyeur with a hankering towards the perverse. He's something of a cipher, a blank slate that could be filled in with either darkness or light -- the darkness being Dorothy, who demands Jeffrey's help yet refuses to go to the police, and who's discovered that she actually likes Frank's kinky violence -- and Sandy, the good girl who first appears to Jeffrey out of the darkness, emerging into a warm bath of light, and who shares her dream where thousands of robins were set free, and they flew down and brought this Blinding Light of Love. The more over his head Jeffrey finds himself, giving in to Dorothy's demands of hit me as foreplay and spying on Frank's creepy warehouse headquarters, the more we squirm. Because unlike conventional movie mysteries, we don't know for sure that Jeffrey will save the day and choose the nice girl; like Jeffrey, we're in completely unfamiliar territory, a dark place where bad people don't make any sense, ears can get cut off for no explicable reason, and sex is as grotesque as it is erotic.Blue Velvet is a film that truly benefits from many repeated viewings, becoming perhaps even more disturbing as things that were once obscure are better understood. Whether you embrace it or reject it, Blue Velvet is an amazing film, an intimate, surreal, true and distinctive experience.

The survivors of Scream 2 reprise their roles, with Neve Campbell as Sidney Prescott, the most stalked woman in film history; Liev Schreiber as wrongly imprisoned murderer Cotton Weary, David Arquette as Barney Fife-style Deputy Dewey Riley, and Courteney Cox as catty tabloid journalist Gale Weathers. Joining them in this cleverly staged slice & dice saga are Patrick Dempsey, Parker You've Got Mail Posey, and the ever reliable Lance Aliens Henriksen.Several years have elapsed since Sidney eluded the last two slashers at Windsor College in Scream 2. She has take refuge at a remote ranch compound near Monterey, California, far from the scene of the original slayings in Woodsboro, changed her name, and works as an anonymous telephone crisis counselor for abused women. Meanwhile, Hollywood has continued to crank out sequels to Stab. Remember Stab, the movie-within-a-movie at the start of Scream 2 where Jada Pinkett and Omar Epps were the first blacks to die in a slasher flick? Anyway, Scream 3 occurs largely on the set of Stab 3. Ex-Deputy Dewey Riley has signed on as the technical consultant, while Cotton Weary, an infamous TV talk show host now, has agreed reluctantly to make a cameo appearance until he receives a cell phone call from a copycat slasher who demands to know Sidney's whereabouts. Not only is the new murderer offing the actors and actresses in Stab 3 who impersonate the Scream characters, but this psycho is also leaving photos of Sidney Prescott's mom at each crime scene. This prompts LAPD Homicide detective Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey of Run), a movie buff himself, to reel in Sidney for questioning, precisely what the villains want, too! Inevitably, Gale Weathers, who enjoyed short-lived fame as the author of a book about the murders, starts snooping around the set as the corpses pile and picks up where she left off with Dewey in Scream 2.Director Wes Craven and Arlington Road scenarist Ehren Kruger have carved out an above-average, razor-sharp horror comedy that brings the series full circle and offers some cutting edge commentary on the film industry as well as copycat killers. As in Scream, Scream 3 indulges in Tinseltown terminology. Sequels qualify as movies that keep replicating the original, while a trilogy boasts a beginning, middle, and an end. One of the worst things about Scream 2 (8\/10 stars) did was killing off geeky Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy), the video store clerk who dissected cinema the way that the villains did their victims. Imaginatively, Craven and Kruger have resorted to the cliché of the &#133; if you're seeing this video, I'm dead to resurrect Jamie in an exhilarating cameo. According to Jamie, In a trilogy, nobody's safe. Even the hero can die in the final chapter.Audiences that flocked to the first two Scream movies will be delighted to know that the third installment follows the formula. The pre-credit slasher sequence in Scream 3 tops previous Scream gambits and delivers the first surprise by disposing of one of the series survivors. What distinguishes Scream 3 is mirror image symbolism. Everybody has a double here, and quite possibly the funniest is the hyperactive Parker Posey, who&#151;as fictional actress Jennifer Jolie&#151;doubles as Courteney Cox's bitchy Gale Weathers. During one of their many confrontations, Jolie informs Weathers that Everywhere you go, I'm gonna follow you, so if he wants to kill you, you'll be there to be killed, and he won't need to kill me.Unless you are a psychic Sherlock, you shouldn't be able either to unravel the multi-layered mystery or to guess the identity of the killer in Scream 3. Unlike earlier Screams, the third entry settles for one killer rather than two. Kruger's complicated screenplay stacks up so much action and exposition that you may have to take notes to cull the clues from the red herrings. Basically, all but one of the survivors from Scream 2 gets out of Scream 3alive--but not without a hell of a lot of howling. Nevertheless, the resolution is pretty clever, and like Scream 2, the back story is what makes Scream 3 so interesting.Appearing in cameos are Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes as Silent Bob and Jay from Clerk, Mallrats, and Dogma. Craven and Kruger take the mirror image symbolism, beyond the fringe with Carrie Fisher. Cast as an embittered studio archivist with a photographic memory for faces and screen names, she explains to Jennifer Jolie and Gale Weathers that she only resembles Carrie Fisher who won the Princess Leia role in Star Wars because the real Carrie Fisher slept with George Lucas!!! Hardcore film fanatics will chuckle when they spot schlockmeister Roger Corman as an antsy studio executive who puts Stab 3 on hold when the murders start and warns director Roman Bridger (Scott Foley) that Violence in cinema is a big deal now.Comparatively, Scream 3, a sequel to shout about, is better than Scream 2 but not as good as the devastatingly original Scream (10\/10) that revived the slasher genre back in 1996. At this point, Craven and company have all but painted t themselves into a corner, even though a fourth installment could conceivably be hacked out.

","genre":"Horror, Mystery"},{"date":"31 March 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" As the final entry in famed horror movie helmer Wes Nightmare on Elm Street Craven's genre-busting slasher film trilogy, Scream 3 combines carnage with comedy, chalking up more than enough suspense, surprises, and shocks to conclude this profitable franchise on a high note. The survivors of Scream 2 reprise their roles, with Neve Campbell as Sidney Prescott, the most stalked woman in film history; Liev Schreiber as wrongly imprisoned murderer Cotton Weary, David Arquette as Barney Fife-style Deputy Dewey Riley, and Courteney Cox as catty tabloid journalist Gale Weathers. Joining them in this cleverly staged slice & dice saga are Patrick Dempsey, Parker You've Got Mail Posey, and the ever reliable Lance Aliens Henriksen.Several years have elapsed since Sidney eluded the last two slashers at Windsor College in Scream 2. She has take refuge at a remote ranch compound near Monterey, California, far from the scene of the original slayings in Woodsboro, changed her name, and works as an anonymous telephone crisis counselor for abused women. Meanwhile, Hollywood has continued to crank out sequels to Stab. Remember Stab, the movie-within-a-movie at the start of Scream 2 where Jada Pinkett and Omar Epps were the first blacks to die in a slasher flick? Anyway, Scream 3 occurs largely on the set of Stab 3. Ex-Deputy Dewey Riley has signed on as the technical consultant, while Cotton Weary, an infamous TV talk show host now, has agreed reluctantly to make a cameo appearance until he receives a cell phone call from a copycat slasher who demands to know Sidney's whereabouts. Not only is the new murderer offing the actors and actresses in Stab 3 who impersonate the Scream characters, but this psycho is also leaving photos of Sidney Prescott's mom at each crime scene. This prompts LAPD Homicide detective Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey of Run), a movie buff himself, to reel in Sidney for questioning, precisely what the villains want, too! Inevitably, Gale Weathers, who enjoyed short-lived fame as the author of a book about the murders, starts snooping around the set as the corpses pile and picks up where she left off with Dewey in Scream 2.Director Wes Craven and Arlington Road scenarist Ehren Kruger have carved out an above-average, razor-sharp horror comedy that brings the series full circle and offers some cutting edge commentary on the film industry as well as copycat killers. As in Scream, Scream 3 indulges in Tinseltown terminology. Sequels qualify as movies that keep replicating the original, while a trilogy boasts a beginning, middle, and an end. One of the worst things about Scream 2 (8\/10 stars) did was killing off geeky Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy), the video store clerk who dissected cinema the way that the villains did their victims. Imaginatively, Craven and Kruger have resorted to the cliché of the &#133; if you're seeing this video, I'm dead to resurrect Jamie in an exhilarating cameo. According to Jamie, In a trilogy, nobody's safe. Even the hero can die in the final chapter.Audiences that flocked to the first two Scream movies will be delighted to know that the third installment follows the formula. The pre-credit slasher sequence in Scream 3 tops previous Scream gambits and delivers the first surprise by disposing of one of the series survivors. What distinguishes Scream 3 is mirror image symbolism. Everybody has a double here, and quite possibly the funniest is the hyperactive Parker Posey, who&#151;as fictional actress Jennifer Jolie&#151;doubles as Courteney Cox's bitchy Gale Weathers. During one of their many confrontations, Jolie informs Weathers that Everywhere you go, I'm gonna follow you, so if he wants to kill you, you'll be there to be killed, and he won't need to kill me.Unless you are a psychic Sherlock, you shouldn't be able either to unravel the multi-layered mystery or to guess the identity of the killer in Scream 3. Unlike earlier Screams, the third entry settles for one killer rather than two. Kruger's complicated screenplay stacks up so much action and exposition that you may have to take notes to cull the clues from the red herrings. Basically, all but one of the survivors from Scream 2 gets out of Scream 3alive--but not without a hell of a lot of howling. Nevertheless, the resolution is pretty clever, and like Scream 2, the back story is what makes Scream 3 so interesting.Appearing in cameos are Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes as Silent Bob and Jay from Clerk, Mallrats, and Dogma. Craven and Kruger take the mirror image symbolism, beyond the fringe with Carrie Fisher.

What is this sex club that requires such surreptitiousness? Nothing out of the ordinary - nothing like the infamous Plato's Retreat of the 1970s. Sex in the club seems terribly ordinary (no dark realizations of taboo practices).And one has only to utter a password to gain entry? Aw come-on - if the members are THAT exclusive, they surely would have more secure procedures to ensure restricted admission.More to the point every time something sexual is about to happen in the movie, it takes on a negative aspect (a sexual encounter turns out to include an underage girl, another possible sex partner is revealed to have HIV, etc).And then there's Tom Cruise, who, by his own admission, had trouble with the part. Small wonder he doesn't have the suave intellectual character needed for the part. He's used to playing highly physically-expressed heroes - not troubled degreed professionals. (He's also never looked more ridiculous standing next to his former wife Nicole - who towers over him despite the fact she must have been sporting flats.)The movie is beautifully photographed, however, and lit to the hilt golds, blues and reds all sensuously rendered in soft focus. But it all seems so unnecessary - even distracting - considering how un-sensational the storyline becomes.Poor Stanley Kubrick - I'm sure he tried very hard to forge a mystery filled with sexual innuendo and ambiguity, but I think, in the end, he simply realized it was a lost cause. He signed off on it - then signed off on Life - leaving Tom and Nicole feeling\/looking guilty for pushing him over the edge due to their inability to connect with the subject matter, And they got divorced!

The naive, wishful-thinking-like musings about human nature seem to come out of the mouths of young children, not adults, but that's perhaps part of the charm. When one of the Shangri-La-ists says that all those evil men in the outside world would perhaps not be evil in Shangri-La, where they have would have everything, it's hard not to frown a bit. Watching this movie as a kid, I loved it; I saw no flaws. However, about 20 years later, I found myself being slightly embarrassed by some of the nonsense that is being said and implied. I guess this is more of a kids' picture. You need to be very wide-eyed and clueless to overlook the glaring problems with the movie's philosophy.The basic premise is excellent a Utopia in a far-flung corner of the world. The fact that they chose Tibet was a bit cheesy though, especially with the phony magical aura that surrounds this region what with the Dalai Lama, Buddhism and its spirituality, and the rest. The irony is that Tibet, before it was conquered by the communists, was anything but a paradise with happy people. It was ruled with no less tyranny than by those who overtook it. It would have added to the sense of mystery if the location of Shangri-La was never mentioned, or if they had made up a name for it.The black-&-white photography is very 30s, i.e. has that old-movie feel, showing its full effect in the areal scenes and mountain footage, although I wished certain scenes were shown in colour. As for the flow of the story, there are major discrepancies in quality the first half hour and the last 15 minutes are superior to anything that happens in-between. Maybe it's not a coincidence at all that this middle part is set in Shangri-La. Perhaps the dullness for the viewer comes from the fact that a perfect world would itself be dull in some ways. This long middle part is full of old-school romantic drivel and other irrelevant or uninteresting scenes.As for characterizations, there are clichés Capra could have done without. Chang is played by a white actor, which is simply laughable. Conway's brother is less than one-dimensional he is CONSTANTLY bitching and throwing temper-tantrums, like a little girl. His character is on the verge of a heart-attack, carrying on all the time like a lunatic. So extreme is this portrayal that Conway's brother almost comes off as unintentionally funny.There were odd details I couldn't quite understand. The Chinese porters shooting at the trio they're leading out of Tibet, for example. Why would they do that? Was that Capra's unsubtle hence ridiculous way of saying how corrupt and evil everyone outside Shangri-La is? Plus, it defies logic that these experienced porters would not know that shooting so much - for absolutely no reason! - might cause an avalanche or two. Capra seems to be saying that Tibetan porters are not only immoral but extremely stupid.However, the most odd detail was the demise of the pilot of the plane. Early in the film, a Chinese man overtakes the cockpit of Conway's flight. We never see this English pilot again, hence I must assume that he was killed. Killed - a victim of Shangri-La's plot to kidnap Conway. Is that how pacifism works? Murder and kidnapping?
