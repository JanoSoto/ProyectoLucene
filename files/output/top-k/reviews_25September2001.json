The quick scenes and music of the preview are awesome. Some of the race scenes in the movie are some of the best if not the best of any racing movie. Other wise the movie is a total piece of crap. Let give you the reader a brief summary of said movie The movie is about a rookie who is burning up the track of either the indy or formula series of cart racing, but lacks the discipline and pure love of racing. So Stallone is called in by Burt Reynolds to help his star rookie to get that certain edge, Stallone has trouble doing this because the rookies brother is his manager and always has the star racer at promotions. Eventually he finally breaks through to the rookie, but thats after a scene when the two Stallone and the rookie racer race through the streets of downtown Chicago. The end is predictable, but I will not tell who or what happens sorry.If you are going to waste your money then by all means do so, but don't say I did not warn you!

Nick Cage was teh main reason I guess. I was immediately attracted to the dvd as I saw it, I have no idea why but I always can tell wether a movie will be good or not. Theres nothing more frustrating then picking a mediocre film to watch and wasting two hours of your life, as the after effect is depressing as hell. Having read about the nature of the film on the back cover of the dvd case I decided to settle down at midnight on my heavenly comfortable couch to watch it. Little did I know that on this rainy cold december night I was in for a gripping two hour ride. Like all good films, this movie grabs you by the scruff of the neck and drags you at its own pace, not allowing you to settleat all. You are thrust straight into action as Nick's character (private investigator) takes on a case that will chane his life forever. The dark and sadistic music adds to the great feel tot eh movie. Joel Schumacher whom I hadn't heard of before this film has done a great job allowing us an insight into a dark and evil side of hollywood, where many youngsters dissappear or perish in search for their dreams. In most cases their end is not graceful to say the least. First time I had the  chance to see Joaquin Phoenix and he too stood out in the film, although his role isn't a major one in the film he has a presence on screen, which was an indication at the time for me that he will go on to do better things. Proved right I was as since then he has become hot property in Hollywood. My admiration for Nick Cage was increaed after watching this film. I believe he is one of the best actors of his generation, and the fact that he agreed to do this controversial film means he is diverse and willing to push himself alot further than others. He is the main attraction in the film, and it is his great acting that allows the viewer to delve deeper with his character into the world of pornography. I finished watching it around 2 in the morning. As the end credits began to roll slowly up the screen the distinctive and rythmic arabic music began, how appropriate it was too. I just remember distinctly, feeling elated emotionally. Nick's character goes through hell emotionally, physically and mentally leaving him exhausted. Thats exactly how I felt. You feel the tension in the film, you feel scared in the film, you feel frustrated as events unfold because they aren't what you expected. Schumacher breaks alot of essential movie rules I read about that directors have in Hollywood. Certain things that the audiences detest in films, good has to prevail in some sense is one example. Now even though I felt he broke alot of these rules I admired the way he added an ironic good always prevails touch. Injustice and evil is present in our world, but so is hope and Justice. Scumacher acknowledges evil and makes a statement not that good always prevails but merely that it does eventually. This film is about true evil, redemption,sacrafice,greed,injustice,suffering,pride and most of all real life. I recomend it.

I can say that I prefer seeing Indy fighting Nazis and chasing religious artifacts. I can say, for short, that I prefer the other two movies to this one. But I won't say that this movie was bad. It really is ultra-violent, and it has some too childish moments (the table scene, which I remember commenting in kindergarten), but, for however no this movie may be, i'll be compelled to shout yes!.

No, because those influences aren't going to be good for Kyle, Stan, or Cartman either. Kyle put it best when he asked his mom not to punish anyone but himself when he does something bad.

It is because of his amazing ability to judge what is needed and what isn't needed in a film that he is (even in death) one of the most revered directors of all time.I'd like to say that Stanley's judgement of Steven being the most capable director to bring A.I. to the screen (apart from himself of course) what right on the money. Although I admit that Steven has made a lot of crap over the years (i.e. The Lost World), no-one can deny that the man has talent. This film is a demonstration of his talent and ability. It is with absolute resolve that I say (this is just personal opinion here) that Steven did an excellent job with the task that Stanley asked him to perform in the event that for some reason he could not bring A.I. to the screen himself.People say that the film wasn't menacing enough. That couldn't be further from the truth. The sheer humanity of the film, how human the mechans really were despite the fact that they were machienes, and how cruelly organic humans regarded them was sinster enough in itself. The gift of A.I. (as the type of A.I. represented in this film) was selfishly used and abused by humanity who were too blind to see that they were not just simple machienes. Rather that the machienes themselves, like humans (although comical in their attempts or their programming to mimic human behaviour or fulfil a specified task), had their own feelings and thoughts and could be considered 'human' by virtue of this basic human trait. The film was sinister in it's exposition of the ignorance and cruelty of human nature. The inherent abuse and disregard that mechans experience at the hands of humans was more than adequate in adding a sinster edge to the film.The acting in this film was nothing short of sensational. I cannot heap enough praise upon Haley Joel Osmont for his show stopping performance as David. If he keeps this standard going (lets hope he will) he'll end up right up there with respected actors like Edward Norton and Robert De Niro. Eventhough he is still a child, he is a first class actor which is very rare considering what the public regard as talented in Hollywood these days. Haley is half their age and has more talent in his earlobe compared to some of the actors\/actresses in Hollywood today. Jude Law was excellent and Giggolo Joe and the special effects....... man Im going to be here all day at this rate.Anyway.... to get to the point. The people who said that this film was bad were probably hardcore Kubrick fans (not that I'm any exception, I absolutely adore Kubrick's work). But it should be acknowledged that there was no way that Steven could have emulated what Kubrick had in mind for this film, he was right in adding his own spin on things (hell Stan himself is guilty of doing the same thing i.e. Clockwork Orange). But the criteria upon which a film should be judged is not simply the tiny little details, but the big picture. It should be a question as to whether or not the work can stand on its own, whether or not it has substance, whether or not it is good cinema or bad cinema. You can be a Kubrick devotee, but that being said you can't simply stick your nose in the air and be blind to the great things that this beautiful film has to offer. As a cardinal rule of lovers of the film meduim, credit must be given where credit is due.As it is well known, it is very fashionable these days to bag out Steven Speilberg. And most Kubrick fans could barely stand the idea of Steven taking on Stanley's unfinished project, thinking that he might ruin everything (I should know I was one of them). There are also those who would bag Steven for other reasons such as being too commercial, being incompetent as well as choosing crappy films to direct to draw the masses (I'll admit to believeing some of this too, but I never doubted the man was talented). But all of this preconcieved baggage was heaped upon A.I., the fact that Steven is a tall poppy and people these days just look for an excuse to bag him out, hindered the ability of many people to see film for what it really was as opposed to it being simply another Steven Speilberg production.I'll grant leaverage to people who admitted the film was good but decided that it wasn't their thing because of personal taste and personal taste alone.But Stanley would be smiling from wherever he is because I'm sure that he would be quite happy with the way Steven's work turned out. It was a wonderful film and I don't care what people say, it needed a happy ending because David deserved one damnit!!! This work can stand on it's own despite the bad reviews it got, and in terms of people thinking that Stan would have made it more sinister all I've got to say is that Stan never made the same film twice, so there is no way you could ever really know for sure what he would have done provided he was alive to do it himself. If you have any doubts just think of Eyes Wide Shut (which is a great film by the way) and don't forget the wonderful reviews that it got.Despite the baggage and the bad reviews because of it, do not be fooled! The critics don't always get it right. A.I., if anything (provided it is watched with an open mind) is proof of that.

","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"25 September 2001","score":"","review":"  Stanley Kubrick was a genius film-maker and a man of very nice judgement. It is because of his amazing ability to judge what is needed and what isn't needed in a film that he is (even in death) one of the most revered directors of all time.I'd like to say that Stanley's judgement of Steven being the most capable director to bring A.I. to the screen (apart from himself of course) what right on the money. Although I admit that Steven has made a lot of crap over the years (i.e. The Lost World), no-one can deny that the man has talent. This film is a demonstration of his talent and ability. It is with absolute resolve that I say (this is just personal opinion here) that Steven did an excellent job with the task that Stanley asked him to perform in the event that for some reason he could not bring A.I. to the screen himself.People say that the film wasn't menacing enough. That couldn't be further from the truth. The sheer humanity of the film, how human the mechans really were despite the fact that they were machienes, and how cruelly organic humans regarded them was sinster enough in itself. The gift of A.I. (as the type of A.I. represented in this film) was selfishly used and abused by humanity who were too blind to see that they were not just simple machienes. Rather that the machienes themselves, like humans (although comical in their attempts or their programming to mimic human behaviour or fulfil a specified task), had their own feelings and thoughts and could be considered 'human' by virtue of this basic human trait. The film was sinister in it's exposition of the ignorance and cruelty of human nature. The inherent abuse and disregard that mechans experience at the hands of humans was more than adequate in adding a sinster edge to the film.The acting in this film was nothing short of sensational. I cannot heap enough praise upon Haley Joel Osmont for his show stopping performance as David. If he keeps this standard going (lets hope he will) he'll end up right up there with respected actors like Edward Norton and Robert De Niro. Eventhough he is still a child, he is a first class actor which is very rare considering what the public regard as talented in Hollywood these days. Haley is half their age and has more talent in his earlobe compared to some of the actors\/actresses in Hollywood today. Jude Law was excellent and Giggolo Joe and the special effects....... man Im going to be here all day at this rate.Anyway.... to get to the point. The people who said that this film was bad were probably hardcore Kubrick fans (not that I'm any exception, I absolutely adore Kubrick's work). But it should be acknowledged that there was no way that Steven could have emulated what Kubrick had in mind for this film, he was right in adding his own spin on things (hell Stan himself is guilty of doing the same thing i.e. Clockwork Orange). But the criteria upon which a film should be judged is not simply the tiny little details, but the big picture. It should be a question as to whether or not the work can stand on its own, whether or not it has substance, whether or not it is good cinema or bad cinema. You can be a Kubrick devotee, but that being said you can't simply stick your nose in the air and be blind to the great things that this beautiful film has to offer. As a cardinal rule of lovers of the film meduim, credit must be given where credit is due.As it is well known, it is very fashionable these days to bag out Steven Speilberg. And most Kubrick fans could barely stand the idea of Steven taking on Stanley's unfinished project, thinking that he might ruin everything (I should know I was one of them). There are also those who would bag Steven for other reasons such as being too commercial, being incompetent as well as choosing crappy films to direct to draw the masses (I'll admit to believeing some of this too, but I never doubted the man was talented).

Then we find out this is just one of Marquis' stories, and we are already into the story of the film. Quills is a film that literally bursts out of the screen with its energy and intrigue, it is a film that feels like you are actually there, experiencing the traumas or happy moments. I felt like I was the Marquis De Sade dancing on the table or writing with my own blood, or like I was Madeline being strapped continuously and been totally engrossed by the Marquis' stories. Unlike some other period dramas, this film is never boring. It always has something going on and you'll find it hard to look away from the screen. I just loved everything about the movie &#150; especially the performances. Geoffrey Rush is a master at this kind of thing. He becomes the Marquis De Sade and I looked at the screen and truly thought it was actually the character. You can't see Geoffrey Rush's acting. He acts in the film naked a lot and puts all of his effort into the making his performance a success. A truly great actor, and a brilliant performance. Kate Winslet also gets naked once again, but we find out there is more to her than a pretty face and a big bust. Joaquin Phoenix is always he always is &#150; strong, real and totally awesome to watch. Phoenix invests his character extremely. He gives a truly memorable performance. Michael Caine was also very good as the villain type guy, but I don't think we saw enough of him. Philip Kaufman's direction is outstanding. He has come up with an excellent film and his effort is truly stupendous. There were some scenes I thought were truly astounding. The play `The Crimes of Love' is hilarious and shows off how much The Marquis De Sade mocks people with his absolute truth. The scenes near the end, including one stunning one when a statue cries blood, are all extremely well directed but I don't want to ruin the end for viewers who haven't seen this film. The script for this movie was dark, funny, literal, intelligent and endlessly intriguing. Kudos, Doug Wright. You wrote an awesome play and a better movie. This movie is controversial, brutal and has a lot of rape, violence, language and particularly revealing sex scenes, but it is all worth it. This movie gets a place in my top 50 favourites.

I like that because I find those 2 styles to be the purest forms of cinema in relation to human emotion the anxiety of fear and the joy of laughter. Dramas are fine, but essentially we're getting our emotions manipulated when we find ourselves crying for the characters on screen. But jumping at a sudden scare or having a good belly laugh are certainly more primal reactions, and neither require having our emotions or mentalities toyed with to get a reaction. An American Werewolf In London certainly delivers the goods in both departments. The dark (and admittedly often sick) humor often provokes laugh out loud reactions from the viewer, and at the same time the horror scenes are simply the scariest werewolf scenes I have ever scene. Now allow me to get out of all the theoretical stuff and into the meat of the movie. I won't bother with the plot since everyone else on here has probably summarized it quite nicely. I will talk about the things I like about this film. Starting with the direction, John Landis simply does a knockout job. He guides the film with enthusiasm and style, keeping things lighthearted at the right moments and mercilessly scaring the audience the rest of the time. The cast here seems to know exactly what they're doing as well; David Naughton and Griffin Dunne both handle their roles with a great balance of serious and silly, and Jenny Agutter is just adorable. Of course no review would be complete with mention of Rick Baker's groundbreaking makeup effects. But I can't really say anything that hasn't been said about his work a thousand times over, so let me just say that this stuff still looks just as good today as it ever did! If you can handle a potent combination of horror and humor, do yourself a favor and check out An American Werewolf In London.

This movie had me on the edge of my seat for the first 45 minutes, and highly interested for the other 45.  I haven't felt such tention in a theater since the first time that I saw the Blair Witch Project.  JC gave me the type of fear that I haven't felt since I was a child watching American Werewolf in London.  And I can't believe that it came from Jeepers Creepers!!!Jeepers Creepers is basically the story of 2 siblings traveling home from school for the holiday.  Of course they decide to take the long way home, on the mostly deserted highway.  Unfortunately for them it's not completely deserted.  They meet up with a freak show villain, and spend the next hour and a half (movie time)running for their lives.First of all, this movie was great because it involved a brother\/sister team.  No love interest, no sexual tension, but rather a brother and sister fighting for one another.  Gina Philips and Justin Long(from tv's Ed) play Trish and Darry, sister and brother in big, BIG trouble.  It was a really nice change from what we always see.Secondly, I was thrilled because the writer\/director (Victor Salva) understands that sometimes what we don't see is scarier than what we do. For the first 45 minutes when the tention was strongest, we don't quite see into the villain's truck, or he's just a little too far away to see clearly. We are scared by our own imaginations, and by the horrific sounds created by the creeper's truck.  That was when this movie was at its best.Unfortunately about half way through this movie, good ol' Victor seemed to forget this philosophy, and the energy diminishes as we see and understand more and more of the villain.  Too bad, this movie could have been amazing.I admit that there are holes in this movie, like what's with the 23rd days and the 23rd years, but ultimately the holes don't matter.  This is the type of movie that you see for atmosphere and tention, not plot and cohesiveness. Because of that, this movie was fantastic..It was way more than I was expecting.

The sets are astonishing, the music is incredible, and the addition of Sean Connery as Henry Jones Sr. is genius, as he and Harrison Ford manage to give birth to Spielberg's finest comedy ever. The theme here is the Holy Grail, a fantastic follow-up to the ark antics of years earlier. The bad guys are the nazis again, but this time the enemy is more subtle and treacherous. As a character says, don't trust anyone. And the quest for the grail allows us to embark on the ride of our lives, as we are taken in boat, plane, car, bike and train chases, as we see the incredible action (the initial sequence of young indy is my favorite) and as I even get to see Indy fighting in a boat off the shore of my country (complete with boxes written in portuguese)! I love this movie, it has good taste, good humor, great music, great cinematography and spills Spielberg's talent through every aspect of it. A triumph, to which I would have given an 11. P.S. Harrison Ford was 47 years old when he shot this movie. He is now almost 60. Lucas is too busy with Star Wars and will touch the Indy adventures just after Episode III (2005). By that time, Indy will be 63 years old. What shall we expect? I hope there's one more to come, I know they won't disappoint us.
