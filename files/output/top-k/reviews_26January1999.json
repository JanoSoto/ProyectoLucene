I could not believe I wasted so much time watching such a poor excuse for cinema. So why bother to write this? I hear you ask. Well, the reason I got through this movie was due to Leo DiCaprio's performance as Arnie Grape. The depth, warmth, sincerity, and above all total and utter credibility and believability (so maybe it's not a word, but it's all that's coming to me right now) made me at first sceptical to believe that it was actually Leonardo on the screen. And after that I completely forgot it was even him. And that is something that is incredibly hard to convince an audience of, especially when you look like he does. I was actually speechless after the closing credits, sat in a wonderment of such phenomenal talent and dedication. It seems an understatement to say that he was worthy of an Oscar. He deserved much more than that, and maybe he got it. If it were anyone but Tommy-Lee Jones' 'Sam Gerard' that beat Leo for the Oscar, I would've lost all faith in the Academy. As it is I can only say that it's a shame that his best work was in such a pathetic movie. Leo saves this from ending up in a dumpster next to The Revenge of the Killer Tomatoes.

It's one of those films that aspires to profundity but ends up just wallowing in its own triviality. The fault lies largely in Willard Carroll's muddled script, which presents us with far too many characters who have almost nothing new or interesting to say about anything, much less love.The ensemble cast, however, is stellar, particularly Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Gillian Anderson, Jon Stewart, and Angelina Jolie (a fiercely talented young actress who gives this film a jolt of energy whenever she is onscreen).I particularly found the scenes between Madeleine Stowe and Anthony Edwards tiresome and pointless. Willard spends so much time jumping back and forth in this circus of under-developed characters that we are not allowed to care for any of them as individuals. And those we do end up caring for we do so only from the artistry of the actors who play them. This is certainly the case for Angelina Jolie's free spirited club girl, as well as Gillian Anderson's tightly wound theatre director.And then, almost like some cheap, last ditch effort to give this muddled mess some form of coherent ending, Carroll throws in a trite plot device that is supposed to make us Ooh and Ahh with glee and wonderment but is just plain insulting. Why? Because anyone who was paying any attention at all during the film could have figured out the ending in a heartbeat.Oh, and another thing. It's almost sacrilege to compare this movie to Robert Altman's scathing but brilliant film, Short Cuts. Short Cuts was a subtle montage of extremely complex characters who were each, in their own way, dealing with inner demons that threatened to destroy them.

I read much about this movie before I saw it, so some of the best parts were spoiled (against my will), but still didn't fail to move me.Since Saving Private Ryan and this movie have been compared so often, I will say that when I first saw Saving Private Ryan I thought it was quite good. Now its message has been blown to bits it seems that the message of that movie, very conventional, was completely hollow compared to Thin Red Line. Thin Red Line's point is not to blow things up or make the viewer cry, though both happened to me. I believe it is to show the very nature of man in times of extreme distress, and how some regress, some are transfigured, and some remain unchanged (or try to remain unchanged). There were also elements of mother earth versus man's futility\/cruelty, but I think that was to underpin the character of the man.Many movies try to reveal the nature of the man, but most rely on that linear Hollywoodian sentimentality (try Patch Adams, which appears to have a higher rating than this movie), which uses conventions that are bound to detract or in my case, disgust. Malick here combines snatches of personal drama with that great psychological profundity portrayed with that universally praised cinematography, but also the monologues, which showed every man, perhaps even just the surface, but every man nonetheless.About the lack of plot - the plot can be contained in the characters in their environment, not the characters themselves but the combined result of their personalities. But each man still remains an unmistakable individual - much like the war they were fighting.This movie is purely abstract. It made me think about many things, and great emotions came from that.

Ryder is one of those few actresses who is able to relay a world of meaning in just her facial expressions alone. She's mesmerizing to watch onscreen.Added to Ryder's enchanting performance is Academy Award winning cinematographer Janusz Kaminski's beautiful, flowing images. There are many tiresome flashback sequences in this film, but they are all worth seeing just for the artistic value of the photography. Kaminski makes wonderful use of fluid camera movements and grainy filters to capture the essence of each time and place portrayed. It's no wonder Kaminski won an Academy Award for his work in Schindler's List and will most likely win another for Saving Private Ryan.Other than these elements, this film has very little going for it. The screenplay is muddled and jumpy, and there are far too many characters with far too many inconsequential flashback sequences that say very little about the nature of either love or commitment. The story concerns nothing more than a bunch of old women sharing completely one-sided and sexist sob stories. Like The Joy Luck Club and Waiting to Exhale, this film portrays men as little more than duplicitous, moronic, emotionally immature children who are incapable of either expressing true love or loyalty. It is a completely shallow look at adult human relationships and has nothing new or profound to say about anything.As a male supporter of feminism and feminist artistic expression, it saddens me that films like this are, first of all, even made, and then marketed as movies that modern women should see and even cherish. There are many far better films about women and their unique experiences, the most recent one being a small film called High Art, written and directed by Lisa Cholodenko and starring Ally Sheedy in one of 1998's best performances.

Now every time we are out together and talking about movies, she tells people about an incredibly boring movie we saw together. Needless to say, I have a much different opinion about this Jim Jarmusch film.Set in the second half of the nineteenth century, this film stars Johnnie Depp as William Blake, an accountant from Cleveland. Travelling out west to start a new job he arrives to find the job has already been given to another man. Nearly broke he meets an ex-prostitute. A shoot out ensues with her (former?) fiance Charlie, played by Gabriel Byrne, in which she and Charlie are killed, while Blake is wounded.Making his escape, he is pursued by three killers hired by Charlie's father (Robert Mitchum in a great cameo). On the run and wounded, Blake meets up with a wandering indian, Nobody. Nobody was schooled in England and is a great admirer of the poetry of William Blake. Mistaking the two Blakes, Nobody travels with Blake, wondering why he knows so little of his own poetry.The movie is, thus, a chase film. But this is not a simple film, and moves more like Portrait of a Lady than The Fugitive.

Even on a VHS format, I felt violated to pay $3.17 to sit down for nearly 3 hours, observing something I cared nothing of. Why it was on so many Top 10 lists, I may never know. You're just as well as having a trite Hollywood action movie on a critic's Top 10 lists. While some of you may have tolerance for unsympathetic slow paced melodramas, I am not saying I dislike Lars Von Trier's work. THE KINGDOM and ZENTROPA were two exceptional and well made films, and I'm quite surprised he didn't continue on with more of his intricate and vibrant imagery after that.  In this, I felt as if I just saw footage of a shakey faded video camera filming feces ridden ocean waves on a rainy foggy Spring day. Can you picture THAT? Waves never breaks, but disappoints.The film focuses on Bess (Emily Watson) a simple minded woman who weds an oil rigger (Stellen Skarsgard). After an accident  which leaves Jan (the rigger) paralized from the waste down, he convinces Bess that the only way he will improve would for her to have sexual affairs with other men, and then tell him the details. This would of been a better idea if it had been a Red Shoe Diaries installment...not that Diaries is even better than this.This film never got going from start, the characters talked as if they didn't exactly have the lines memorized (so it took them a while to remember). In the time I sat through it, I was waiting for something to happen. Waiting for a tragedy that really touched the viewer. Waiting for the dialogues to speed up.

The conclusion is very hard, but we've got there a reflection about power in general, not only about men and women,about those who have power (like Chad and Howard) and those who don't have the sanme power (Christine and Kif). we're also amazed to see this kind of men, the white collars, be shown that way while they usually are shown as example for the american dream of the individualism and economical liberalism. I told many people to watch it, they all liked it, I even watched it with a feminist, who loved it, but it provides you a big big headache. That's a movie which dares to show things. Neil LaBute is a director to follow. ","genre":"Comedy, Drama"}]
