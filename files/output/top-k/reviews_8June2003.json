[{"date":"8 June 2003","score":"","review":"  Rounders, written by Levien\/Koppelman(Knockaround Guys) and starring Matt Damon, Edward Norton and John Malkovich, tells a compelling story of a young man whose survival has been fueled by his hustle as a Rounder.  He makes ends meet by gambling in card games, his education in Law School is dependent on his gambling money but when he loses his bankroll to a Russian mobster(played wonderfully by John Malkovich), he decides to give it all up but when his friend(Edward Norton) gets caught in a tight spot with debtors he is forced to go back to rounding.  John Malkovich takes another accent the same way he did in Knockaround Guys, and Matt Damon is great as the main character Well-scripted tale about high stakes gambling and how it can make you or break you... I personally understood this as I know some whose lives depend on gambling so it hit home for me and I enjoyed it very much.
