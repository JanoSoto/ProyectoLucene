I thought this was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. It moved slowly, characters were completely undeveloped and uninteresting. No one was especially GOOD, so it's understandable that they weren't likable, but it really was just not an interesting film overall. I was very disappointed. Mel did fine; in fact, there was nothing wrong with the acting in my opinion. It was the plot, dialogue, and gray-ness of the movie that was so bad. I couldn't wait to get outside and see the daylight. What a waste of a perfectly good afternoon!
