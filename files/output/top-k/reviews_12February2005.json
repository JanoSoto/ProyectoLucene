For 35 years, I've heard it from both sides of the critics' fence. Outstanding and superb on one side and stupid and ridiculous on the other side. These are the reasons for the axiom to watch the movie yourself and form your own opinion.Nominated for an astonishing ten Academy Awards including Best Picture, Airport was the forerunner of a series of disaster movies that would find their place in the 70's and 80's. There is enough trivia connected with this movie to fill a library.Unlike many of Hollywood's more noticed efforts, the central theme of Airport centers not around its billboard stars, which I have reversed in the banner above, but in the supporting cast around which the theme is created. Rarely has a movie shown such a diversity of cast as this one.Burt Lancaster's over-acting notwithstanding, his portrayal of the embattled airport manager of Lincoln International Airport (O'Hare's alter ego) lends the first emotional crisis of the movie. His influence in the story itself is a series of highs and lows.Dean Martin never tried to make his mark in the world as an actor. The reason he was loved by so many, including myself, was his easy going demeanor and the fact that he had one of most beautiful singing voices of any man alive. The fact that Universal Pictures wanted him in the movie is rather a no-brainer...he was so handsome.Martin and Lancaster provide the star quality, but it is the myriad of supporting actors and actresses that provide the substance Van Heflin as D O Guerrero, the psychotic, delusional and even pathetic man who sets the sequence of events for the last half of the movie.Maureen Stapleton, his long-suffering and equally frightened wife.Dana Wynter, the selfish, hot-tempered wife of Mel Bakersfeld (Lancaster).Barbara Hale, wife of Vernon Demerest (Martin) who tells her brother Mel that she is Vernon's disaster insurance (against marital infidelity) and realizes too late that she was wrong.George Kennedy, the enthusiastic, aggressive maintenance manager who does what the Boeing book said couldn't be done. HIS over-acting was on purpose and it was great.Jacqueline Bisset, Vernon's love interest and the gorgeous stewardess carrying his child. The scene between her and Martin in the cabin before takeoff, when she lets him know she's pregnant is precious. Her beautiful voice and accent could boil lead.And here she comes...(drum roll) Helen Hayes, gifted with the title of First Lady of The American Theatre. And a proper title it is, so much so that Oscar had the chance to walk home with ten people, but he picked her. She is the only performer to win both Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress. As we all know, her performance here was priceless.Producer Ross Hunter bet the bank on this motion picture and won. It grossed a mind-boggling 70 million dollars, unheard of for a movie at that time. Dean Martin got the tithe. Universal Pictures had their coffers stuffed for years. Director and Screenplay Oscar nominee George Seaton was set for life. Alfred Newman's opening credit music is atrocious and exhausting, but once you get past that, Airport Love Theme, played twice during conversations between Martin and Bisset, is no less than beautiful.Airport is a standard, classic masterpiece and always will be and no movie critic will ever convince me otherwise. I formed my opinion on my own. Now dust it off of your shelf, watch it again and form your own.

It's amazing how different this movie is than the Lord of the Rings films, both in style and, even more, obviously, in content. With the Wachowski brothers, you could at least see the seeds of their style in earlier, trashier movies like Bound. I won't spend much time comparing this to The Lord of the Rings, because I'm sure anyone who has watched it anytime in the last four years did so because Peter Jackson went from making movies like this to making one of the biggest and best trilogies ever made.The movie is so grotesque that it has created something of a cult following despite being something of a conglomeration of a great many other horror films. Many of the zombies move and look very similar to those in the Evil Dead movies; the main character, Lionel, looks and acts strikingly similar to Dr. Herbert West from Re-Animator and, when we first meet him, he's a grown man under the complete control of his mother (as in Willard) and then later he's obsessed with his dead mother, although for slightly different reasons than Norman Bates. The gore effects look exactly like those in Day of the Dead (the sick one of the Night of the Living Dead films), especially when zombies bite people and pull on their elastic skin. Not very realistic, but then again, I've never seen someone bite into anyone else, so maybe that's what it really looks like.It all starts when some zoologist brings a rat-monkey with mystical powers to a zoo in New Zealand, against the advice of the locals of the island where it was found, who fear it like a malevolent god. Ultimately it ends up at a zoo where it routinely punches and eats monkeys in neighboring cages and, when it is lucky enough to get it's creepy clutches on a human, it starts making zombies.From this point on, it is really a pretty routine zombie movie, but what stands out is the sheer magnitude of the gore. It all started with Lionel's mother, who is the one who got bitten by the monkey at the beginning of the movie. Before long, her wound is festering and explodes this absolutely disgusting, creamy, bloody substance all over the wall.Check this out, when I was watching this scene, I had made the mistake of eating dinner, which in most cases wouldn't be too horribly bad. I've eaten plenty of meals while watching horror movies, but when this scene came on, I was eating onion rings and dipping them in a mixture of ketchup and ranch dressing. It's actually pretty good, I recommend it, but NEVER eat it while you are watching this movie! Never in my life have I come so close to vomiting because of a movie I was watching, it was awful. I fed most of the rest of them to the dog.In addition to that, a guy gets his entire rib cage ripped out, a zombie punches a girl in the neck from behind, shoving his fist through her head and out her mouth, a poor fat guy east pudding with a nice serving of the above-mentioned fluid flowing and pussing from Lionel's mother's wound, more than one person is halved (and not stopped), one zombie gets some hedge clippers through the mouth and beheaded, one poor girl gets a light fixture through the back of her head which then glows and later ignites, and of course, Lionel plows through a roomful of zombies with a lawnmower in what is probably the most famous scene in the film.And not only is that not all, that's not even HALF of it. Blood and guts are everywhere in this movie, it is absolutely unbelievable. Five years earlier, Peter Jackson directed a movie called Bad Taste. I think that in this movie the extent of bad taste is illustrated in a scene where a fart loudly emanates from a disembodied large intestine. I have seen hundreds and hundreds of horror films, and there were dozens of things in this movie that I had never seen before (Lionel's mother, for example, eats her own ear in one scene). The return of Lionel's mother at the end of the movie is truly a spectacle to behold.If Timothy Balme was as good of a comic actor as Bruce Campbell this movie would have been as funny as the Evil Dead films (consider, for example, the scene where Lionel enters with the lawnmower with the strong backlight and the one liner &#150; Party's over. That's Ash talking). It does, after all, feature countless morbidly amusing scenes as the farting intestine, an incessantly giggling alien baby, lot of severed heads getting kicked around like soccer ball (one of which slides all over the floor before finally being put into a blender and liquefied), there are countless organic explosions, if I can be excused a massive euphemism, and a circus music soundtrack throughout much of the film.Dead Alive is not a scary movie, it's a horror movie (note that there is a difference). It is never scary, but it is truly gruesome. Marilyn Manson released an album a couple years ago called The Golden Age of Grotesque (which is also the name of one of the better songs on the album), and I could swear it was named in reference to this movie.As far as sheer volume, this is by leaps and bounds the goriest film I've ever seen in all my life, I can't wait for the 4-disc New Line Platinum Edition!

With the Wachowski brothers, you could at least see the seeds of their style in earlier, trashier movies like Bound. I won't spend much time comparing this to The Lord of the Rings, because I'm sure anyone who has watched it anytime in the last four years did so because Peter Jackson went from making movies like this to making one of the biggest and best trilogies ever made.The movie is so grotesque that it has created something of a cult following despite being something of a conglomeration of a great many other horror films. Many of the zombies move and look very similar to those in the Evil Dead movies; the main character, Lionel, looks and acts strikingly similar to Dr. Herbert West from Re-Animator and, when we first meet him, he's a grown man under the complete control of his mother (as in Willard) and then later he's obsessed with his dead mother, although for slightly different reasons than Norman Bates. The gore effects look exactly like those in Day of the Dead (the sick one of the Night of the Living Dead films), especially when zombies bite people and pull on their elastic skin. Not very realistic, but then again, I've never seen someone bite into anyone else, so maybe that's what it really looks like.It all starts when some zoologist brings a rat-monkey with mystical powers to a zoo in New Zealand, against the advice of the locals of the island where it was found, who fear it like a malevolent god. Ultimately it ends up at a zoo where it routinely punches and eats monkeys in neighboring cages and, when it is lucky enough to get it's creepy clutches on a human, it starts making zombies.From this point on, it is really a pretty routine zombie movie, but what stands out is the sheer magnitude of the gore. It all started with Lionel's mother, who is the one who got bitten by the monkey at the beginning of the movie. Before long, her wound is festering and explodes this absolutely disgusting, creamy, bloody substance all over the wall.Check this out, when I was watching this scene, I had made the mistake of eating dinner, which in most cases wouldn't be too horribly bad. I've eaten plenty of meals while watching horror movies, but when this scene came on, I was eating onion rings and dipping them in a mixture of ketchup and ranch dressing. It's actually pretty good, I recommend it, but NEVER eat it while you are watching this movie! Never in my life have I come so close to vomiting because of a movie I was watching, it was awful. I fed most of the rest of them to the dog.In addition to that, a guy gets his entire rib cage ripped out, a zombie punches a girl in the neck from behind, shoving his fist through her head and out her mouth, a poor fat guy east pudding with a nice serving of the above-mentioned fluid flowing and pussing from Lionel's mother's wound, more than one person is halved (and not stopped), one zombie gets some hedge clippers through the mouth and beheaded, one poor girl gets a light fixture through the back of her head which then glows and later ignites, and of course, Lionel plows through a roomful of zombies with a lawnmower in what is probably the most famous scene in the film.And not only is that not all, that's not even HALF of it. Blood and guts are everywhere in this movie, it is absolutely unbelievable. Five years earlier, Peter Jackson directed a movie called Bad Taste. I think that in this movie the extent of bad taste is illustrated in a scene where a fart loudly emanates from a disembodied large intestine. I have seen hundreds and hundreds of horror films, and there were dozens of things in this movie that I had never seen before (Lionel's mother, for example, eats her own ear in one scene). The return of Lionel's mother at the end of the movie is truly a spectacle to behold.If Timothy Balme was as good of a comic actor as Bruce Campbell this movie would have been as funny as the Evil Dead films (consider, for example, the scene where Lionel enters with the lawnmower with the strong backlight and the one liner &#150; Party's over. That's Ash talking). It does, after all, feature countless morbidly amusing scenes as the farting intestine, an incessantly giggling alien baby, lot of severed heads getting kicked around like soccer ball (one of which slides all over the floor before finally being put into a blender and liquefied), there are countless organic explosions, if I can be excused a massive euphemism, and a circus music soundtrack throughout much of the film.Dead Alive is not a scary movie, it's a horror movie (note that there is a difference). It is never scary, but it is truly gruesome. Marilyn Manson released an album a couple years ago called The Golden Age of Grotesque (which is also the name of one of the better songs on the album), and I could swear it was named in reference to this movie.As far as sheer volume, this is by leaps and bounds the goriest film I've ever seen in all my life, I can't wait for the 4-disc New Line Platinum Edition!

Everyone should know, but let's take a little history course. In 1975, a movie titled Jaws (directed by S. Spielberg) hit movie theaters and was an instant success. A sequel was released a few years later, simply titled Jaws 2. That did alright, but wasn't anywhere close to be going good. Around 1982, a 3rd was filmed... in 3-D (titled Jaws 3, sometimes 3-D). The movie sucked (and is ranked somewhere in the worst 75 movies of all time list here), but not enough for someone to say Hey! Maybe this should be the last! So we get Jaws The Revenge...(blows flatulence) That is what I think of this movie.First, you have a pretty bad excuse of actors... and Michael Caine (who did the movie thanks to a s**t load of money, a trip to the Bahamas, and a new vacation mansion built with the money). You have Mario Van Peebles playing the worst stereotype Jamaican of all time, and some other douche with a beard as Michael Brody.The plot is even more ridiculous. A Great White Shark TAKES REVENGE ON A FAMILY. Didn't ANYONE watch Jaws 2, where the woman says Sharks don't take things personally? I would assume not. So, in a MAJOR SPOILER, Sean Brody is killed by a mysterious shark (while getting his limbs ripped off, losing bucket loads of blood) he is still very much conscious, and able to scream for his life with the energy of a 6 year old on crack. Last I checked, people who lose THAT much blood are either passed out or dead, not screaming and clinging on to things the whole time, pretending nothing happened.So, Ellen Brody decides to go on Vacation with her son Michael, and his wife and daughter... TO THE BAHAMAS. Yes, going from an island of the coast of whatever to another Island makes so much f****** sense. Somehow, a shark, mind you ones that cannot survive in the warm waters off the Caribbean, follows them... 5,000 miles in a span of 2 days. Sharks can only travel 30-ish MPH I thought, and if it takes a plane to fly from Eastern United States to Japan 18-20 hours, it will take a s**t load more time than 40 hours for a f****** shark to swim from the Northeastern United States to Carribena Islands.The Shark is also excruciatingly bad. While the first one at least looked SOMEWHAT real, this one looks like a condom painted gray and with eyes, a.k.a a piece of s*** rubber. Not only that, the thing barely has ANY movement, and in many scenes, the contraption DRAGGING the shark along the ocean floor is clearly visible. I guess filming in such light and warm waters wasn't such a great idea, was it? Also, you can even see the outer working material holding the shark together!!! The less said about how this thing could stand on its fin and roar like a lion... for 30 seconds, the better.I think I've said enough, as right now it's just pissing me off that they went from an All-time Classic in Jaws to this pile of garbage. I would rather watch The Cat in the Hat on a 72 hour loop than watch this crap again.

Appropriately slow, with good character development, it features what, in retrospect, was an all-star cast of young talent. It is a movie I could watch every month and never get tired of it.SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW. Robert Redford plays Tom Booker, living on a ranch in Montana, and who we come to know as the horse whisperer, one who can calm horses by what he says to them in a low voice. Rising star Scarlett Johansson plays Grace who, while on a morning ride in rural New York in the snow, has an accident which kills her friend Judith (rising star Kate Bosworth), cases Grace to lose a leg, and severely injures her horse. Grace's mother is Annie (Kristen Scott Thomas), a very busy New York executive who takes time off to hunt up Tom Booker, and convince him to work with the horse, and more importantly, with Grace.Most of the movie is filmed on the ranch in Montana, the healing process is gradual and difficult, but eventually succeeds. Annie and Grace's dad, Robert (Sam Neill), have become 'cool' to each other, and Annie develops a romance with Tom. In a nice bit of writing, in the end Annie and Robert appear to be making strides to improve their relationship, instead of Annie ending up with Tom.Other notables in this movie are Dianne Wiest, Chris Cooper (one of our better actors working today), and Cherry Jones (another fine but under-appreciated actress).The movie has special meaning to me because I first saw it in the theater in 1998 in Kalispell, Montana, during my month-long vacation there.

At the same time, he informally adopts a street kid (Charlie Korsmo), encounters problems with girlfriend Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly), and flirts with Breathless Mahoney (Madonna).If I were to rate Dick Tracy only on production design--sets, matte paintings, costumes, special make-up, color schemes, and so on--I wouldn't hesitate to give it a 10. Throughout its length, the film looks fantastic--like a surreal, day-glo, pop art film noir. Super saturated primary and secondary colors dominate, occasionally offset by rich tertiary colors. The colors are consistently combined in effective, varied and intriguing ways. The surreal locations are a combination of matte paintings and sets seamlessly melded in a manner that remains technically impressive. The make-up effects for Dick Tracy's bizarre characters are excellent. They manage to both capture the precise look of the comic books villains and appear realistic at the same time. If the film were just a set of art photos and\/or paintings, it would be one of the masterpieces of at least the 1990s.However, as a film, there's a story that writers Jim Cash and Jack Epps, Jr. want to tell. That story is a complete mess. For some godforsaken reason, Cash and Epps try to include every villain from the Tracy comics that they can remember. They seem to also include half of the plot lines they can remember. But they forget to write in any explanation or motivation for why Tracy is going after whomever he's going after at a given moment. Combined with overly quick, abrupt editing that too often bounces back and forth between unrelated scenes, the plot seems as if Cash and Epps set out bullet points of villains, villain interconnections and schemes, then threw them together almost randomly in a string of non-sequiturs.Characters played by well-known and capable actors are completely wasted. There's just not enough time to get into them. Others, such as Madonna, seem to have demanded contractual clauses that guaranteed screen time (in this case featuring singing) whether the appearance serviced the story or not. Some of the cast, such as Pacino, crazily overact. Others, such as William Forsythe as Flattop, turn in understated performances. I don't mind either style (and who is more fun to watch chewing scenery than Pacino?) but Beatty, who also directed, appears to have not known what he wanted to shoot for in that capacity. Part of the problem could be confusion due to the script being such a mess. Beatty, by the way, displays a peculiar inability to change his facial expression, which remains cemented in a seemingly new character--I'll name him Frogface--throughout the film (maybe that's how Beatty always is and I just didn't notice it so much before). In terms of his vocal phrasing and general emoting, Beatty portrays Tracy as a cross between Bob Newhart, Keanu Reeves and Harrison Ford. I like all of those other actors, and I'm definitely a fan of oddities, but in this context, I'm not sure it works. I was never a big reader of the Tracy comics, though. Maybe it's a perfect fit, but I'm guessing that it makes as much sense as Gilbert Gottfried as Batman (which, come to think of it, I'd like to see, but obviously more as a spoof).There appear to be fans of this film, so the plot must not be such a mess and the performances must not be so questionable in everyone's opinion. For my part, I suggest that you watch the film like a slide show while you put on a couple CDs for a soundtrack and ignore any pretense of a story.

Others are great because they transport you to a time or place that is exotic or different or unknown. Reality Bites is not one of those films.Instead, this is a movie that is great because it's true. I was a teenager when this film came out - too young to be living it but old enough to be afraid of it. (As another comment put it, I fall into that skipped-over generation between GenX and GenY).

But the confusion, the aimlessness, the frustration that life won't be the way you planned and the fear that maybe all the hard work won't pay off, well, that stayed with me.There were so many classic scenes in this film that I can't even begin to list them. I can just say that there's a general feeling with this film that the actors, the writer, the director... everyone just gets it. They tap into what it's like to have followed all the predictable, next-step paths of life and done all the things we were supposed to do, and find at the end of them that instead of the keys to the city, we were handed a big giant blank. They know what it's like to be confused about life, confused about love, confused about pretty much everything... and be learning that a future is something you build one step at a time.I can't review Reality Bites without mentioning the soundtrack. There is no other movie whose soundtrack has made it into such heavy rotation in my CD player for so many years. Lisa Loeb, U2, Lenny Kravitz, and of course My Sharona - just to name a few - make this movie so much of what it is.Reality Bites is a movie that people either love or hate.

My vote is nine.Title (Brazil) Um Homem, Uma Mulher (A Man, A Woman) ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"12 February 2005","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I saw The Messenger recently, and I was honestly blown away. Quite frankly, I thought it was brilliant.For a start, I thought Milla Jovovich's performance was simply amazing. While she may have been wasted with things like Resident Evil Apocalypse of late, she really is a superb actress when given the right script. I thought she actually showed a great deal of potential in The Fifth Element, despite the genre of that film limiting the chances to show any real acting ability.Not so here. As well as getting to kick ass in her normal manner, she also turns in a great dramatic performance, and really makes you feel the emotions her character is going through. She has a wonderful vulnerable quality (which was demonstrated admirably in The Fifth Element)... Winona Ryder is about the only other actress I can think of with the same talent in this regard.There's also an extremely able supporting cast. Despite having an accent that's completely out of place, John Malkovich is great as Charles. Vincent Cassell also turns in a good performance in a role which could have been merely comic relief, but one which he drags to a level above that (although he looks distractingly like Matthew Lillard at times). Faye Dunaway does well with a character who doesn't exactly exude personality, while Dustin Hoffman... well, Dustin Hoffman is there.I also thought the look of the film was fantastic. The realism of the battle scenes is impressive, and Luc Besson's direction really brings them to life. No punches are pulled and we see people decapitated, amputated and maimed all round... and hey, who doesn't enjoy a good decapitation now and then? I also thought the costumes were great, especially those of Faye Dunaway's character. The costumes of the extras and minor characters also look fantastic, and it adds an extra level of realism to the look of the film.As for the story... well, I find it hard to comment. I'll admit that I'm pretty ignorant of the real tale of Joan of Arc, so I have no idea how closely this adaptation sticks to it. What I will say is that I found the story the film presents engrossing, and despite the fact I had originally planned to watch only an hour of the film before switching over, it hooked me, and kept me hooked until the very end.I did feel the film had one weakness however -- nothing about Joan is ever really explained. We never find out if her visions were really a message from God, or merely a product of her own imagination. Her mental state and ability are well represented during the film (especially with Jovovich's great performance), but there are no clear answers about her character. I guess this is designed to let the audience believe whatever they want to, but I'd have preferred a more committed stance from the film itself as to the how and why of Joan of Arc.I'd never even heard of this film prior to seeing it. It was simply something I started watching to pass the time while waiting for something else to start, but I'm glad I chose to watch it. I think it's a strong contender for a place on my top twenty list.Highly recommended.

I'm glad i didn't, because this is one of THE WORST films i've ever seen. Not only is the plot weak (although the idea of this story being real was very well marketed), it was not at all scary! Let me just say, I scare fairly easily, and yet by halfway through this film, I was falling asleep with boredom. The movie follows three teenagers on a film making adventure into the woods to create a documentary on a local legend - the Blair Witch. Then while they are in the woods, (suposedly) creepy things start to happen... Thats pretty much all there is to this film. Not even the descent into helplessness by the main characters as the journey unfolds could hold my interest (and I sat through Gosford Park...twice). Nothing scary ever happens, just a few weird noises and abnormal rock formations, and thats basically it. I suppose the scares in this movie are meant to come from fear for the main characters in their somewhat unfortunate situation. Sadly, because nothing seriously dramatic (or even attention grabbing) ever happens, as a viewer I couldn't see what the big deal was. I know its supposed to be realistic, and we're meant to see ourselves in that situation, but by that stage I was disenchanted with the whole painful ordeal. Of course, there is the question of the mysterious Blair Witch herself. She is supposed to command fear because we never see her, leaving her as an invisible force of danger. Sorry, still not good enough. Because we are never shown the witch in the act of moving rocks or stalking the teenagers, we are meant to assume it was her, I quite honestly didn't feel threaten at all. Even the (exciting?)climatic sequence left much to be desired, such as an actual conclusion, and I found myself relieved that I could then find a more riveting was to waste my time (such as watching paint dry). If you are one of those people who thought that The Blair Witch Project was the scariest film of all time, I suggest you watch Bambi. It'll scare you senseless.

I was six years old when this movie came out and my father(Jose) took us to see the movie. It was the only movie my father ever took us to see. What is funny about that is that it took about 16 years to figure out why this was the only movie he ever took the family to see. My father always loved and believed in aliens. 16 years later I realized he took us to see this movie because it was about an alien from outer space. I remember the ending of the movie. As we were leaving I was crying so much. I asked my father is he coming back and he said yes he will. (He told me that so I can stop crying). The movie is a pure classic 80's movie. It takes me back to being young, playing with all the toys that were our there are the time, the music, the clothes. Ahhh Great. I LOVE E.T.
