[{"date":"11 December 2013","score":"","review":" This movie brings me to a bit of a dichotomy. The movie itself and the character interaction was good but the characters themselves irritated me. Basically we had the main character, Mike, had just lost his girlfriend, who said that she would give him a call. He is depressed (and this depression lasts 6 months) and his friend Trent tries to show him a good time. In the end he meets a girl who is in the same situation as he is and they end up going out.Mike spends the entire movie moping about his lost love and tries to extract sympathy from those around him. The problem here is that his girlfriend means everything to him, and when she is stripped away from him he has absolutely nothing left in his life. In fact he has quite a good life as he has friends, he is attractive, and his film career is on its way with a part in a pilot and hosting a comedy club. Yet he does not realise this, and in fact is so fixated on his ex-girlfriend that he ends up driving other girls away (though he elicits the sympathy of two waitresses in Las Vegas).His friend Trent is the opposite. He goes around with the belief that he is the greatest thing around. He believes that he can pick and chose his girls, and really treats them like sex objects. He cannot understand the deep rent in the relationship that Mike is experiencing. His answer is a couple of girls and pointless sex - that solves everything. His whole belief is undermined at the end when he believes that a woman is making baby faces at him when in fact she is making faces at her baby.What this movie does well is that it draws out the attitudes and beliefs of the characters. Even though they are annoying, they are real. People do feel depressed for six months after losing a love, especially if it is a relationship as such. I personally felt irritated over the characters, but the film itself was good. ","genre":null},{"date":"11 December 2013","score":"","review":" This movie brings me to a bit of a dichotomy.

If you ever thought sports were just a game then this film will flip that viewpoint on its end. The casting is odd yet superb.

You get it from all angles in this film from the team's owner, the doctors, the players, the coaches, the social cling-on's, and the uninformed bystanders. Truly a well balanced piece of film making, that to this day, still will casts some negativity in the minds of the football fan.

Please read other quotes listed here. Films that are cutting-edge as this one, also tend to be time-sensitive, and NDF is no exception as some things will undoubtedly seem old-hat to most viewers, but there is still plenty of meat left on the bone to make seeing this a priority.

All of those combinations make I'm Gonna Git You Sucka a Cult Classic and Keenen Ivory Wayans at his best.I'm Gonna Git You Sucka tells the story of Jack Spade(Keenen Ivory Wayans,(who also wrote and directed)a soldier who has just returned home from the Army and finds out that his brother Junbug has been killed and crime in his hometown is being ran by local crime lord Mr. Big(John Vernon). Tired of the crime and violence,Jack asks for the help of John Slade,(Bernie Casey),a crime fighter from the 1970s to help take down Mr. Big and laughs and chaos ensue.I'm Gonna Git You Sucka is one of the all time great Comedy classics that is funny and hilarious from beginning to end and is one of the best Spoofs and Parodies that ranks alongside Airplane and The Naked Gun Trilogy and is a Comedy that is underrated. I'm Gonna Git You Sucka is a movie that perfectly makes fun of the Blaxploitation movies of the 1970s films such as Shaft,Superfly,Coffy,Foxy Brown and Dolemite just to name a few. Like some of the best Spoofs and Parodies IGGYS takes all of the trademarks and style of those films and turns them on their head with rapid fire humor showing the silliness and craziness of Blaxploitation movies and Writer-Director Keenen Ivory Wayans pulls out all the stops making fun of the genre while paying homage to the genre taking hilarious shots at Action heroes,criminals and Blaxploitation stereotypes of the 1970s. The Comedy and laughs in IGGYS is laugh out loud hilarious and you will have tears rolling down your eyes because with every scene because there are gags and moments that are over the top and unpredictable to the point you never know what will happen next. The Comedy is also imaginative and creative and done with an energy and style that is nonstop and raunchy and the movie never loses it's demented edge until the very end.(Instead of dealing with drug use like the Blaxploitation films IGGYS deals with Gold chains,OG or Over Goldan overdose of too many Gold chains making fun of the way Hip-Hip artists and criminals who were wearing lots of Gold chains in the 1980s)The Comedy in IGGYS can not only be seen as an introduction to the Wayans family but also a precursor to Keenen Ivory Wayans terrific sketch Comedy series In Living Color and the Wayans family's other funny and amazing Spoofs Don't Be A Menace and Scary Movie. Jack Spade and the other main characters are so outrageous and over the top it makes the characters and situations in the film wilder and funnier it's almost like looking at a cartoon that is more insane than the Blaxploitation movies the film's making fun of. With each main character no ones head is on straight and when things happen to the characters you as a viewer are along for the ride. The screenplay by Keenen Ivory Wayans is fantastic and memorable with lines and scenes that are wild and unforgettable. Although a Spoof of Blaxploitation films,IGGYS has fun appearances from 1970s Film and Television icons such as Bernie Casey,Issac Hayes,Jim Brown,Antonio Fargus,Clarence Williams III,Eve Plumb(Jan of The Brady Bunch)and Janet DuBois who are all have fun with their characters sometimes playing it straight but not taking the performances too seriously. I would have loved to seen Fred Williamson,Pam Grier,Ron O'Neal and Rudy Ray Moore in the movie as well. Although IGGYS is a Comedy,there is also a few well done Action scenes which are exciting and explosive but at the same time add to the Surreal and outlandish tone of the movie. The ending of I'm Gonna Git You Sucka is amazing,funny,Action packed and is a wonderful conclusion to this classic film.The cast is wonderful. Keenen Ivory Wayans is excellent and hilarious as Jack Spade,with Wayans bringing laughs and energy to the role. Bernie Casey is brilliant and funny as John Slade and has great scenes with Wayans. Antonio Fargas is terrific and cool as Flyguy,a pimp. Steve James is wonderful as Kung-Fu Joe,a Kung-Fu master that helps Jack and John. Issac Hayes and Jim Brown are great and funny as Hammer and Slammer,a crime fighting duo. Ja'net DuBois is outstanding as Belle,Jack's loving but overprotective Mother. Dawnn Lewis is terrific and beautiful as Cheryl,Jack's love interest. John Vernon is delightful as Mr. Big,a local crime lord. Damon Wayans and Kadeem Hardison are a fantastic laugh riot as Leonard and Willie,Mr Big's henchmen. Also,lookout for fun cameos from Clarence Williams III(Kalinga),Eve Plumb(Kalinga's wife),Chris Rock(Rib Joint Customer),Kim Wayans(Nightclub singer),Shawn and Marlon Wayans(Pedestrians),David Alan Grier(Newsman),Clu Gulager(LT.Baker),Anne-Marie Johnson(Cherry),Robin Harris(Bartender At Sam's,John Whitherspoon(Reverand)Hawthorne James(One Eyed Sam),Gary Owens(Pimp Of The Year Pageant Announcer)and Tony Cox(Wayne Evans).The direction by Keenen Ivory Wayans is wonderful,with Wayans moving the camera and bringing a wild energy to the film.

Jackson & Liev Schreiber as a group of doctors\/scientists brought together as an investigative group by the military after a spaceship is found deep in the ocean. They will be staying in deep sea habitats, and upon arrival, find that inside the ship is a sphere that seems to have affected their minds, making their fears come true. It turns out that it is a semi-sentient being that the human mind cannot fully control or comprehend, and the dilemma of what to do about it forms the basis of the plot. Good acting and direction, but story, while intelligent and even logical, paints itself in a corner dramatically, and viewer will either be intrigued or infuriated by the outcome. An interesting misfire.
