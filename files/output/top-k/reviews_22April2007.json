The cast is a whose who of the 1950's with stirring performances by Montegomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor, & Shelly Winters. There is excellent support provided by a lot of others headed by a fine performance by Raymond Burr playing a DA who makes sure of a conviction.Clift plays a young man who falls in love with 2 women. As this is still an immoral activity in our society (until some judge makes a decision that infidelity is a form of discrimination & not a valid grounds for a divorce), his character is torn apart within himself as the story unfolds. Clift is super in this role.He is poor young George Eastman who comes to a big city where his Uncle owns the biggest company in town Eastman Industries. When he gets a job with the company, everyone assumes George is going places because of his Uncle. He starts on an assembly line and falls in love with a co-worker (Shelly Winters)which is a forbidden relationship per his Uncles rules. They keep the secret from almost everyone.Then his Uncle spots him & decides it is time for him to go where everyone expects. He meets the lovely Angela(Taylor) at his Uncles big party & falls in love too. Clift's portrayal of loving 2 women & being torn between them is what makes this film excellent.He leads the double life until Winters tells him she is going to have his child & that he has to do the right thing by her and marry her. (Note this value changed in our society starting with the legalization of abortion). From here, he becomes less & less stable as he is torn between the women.He pictures a way to kill Winters character, then when he attempts to carry it out, realizes he can't really do it, but then carries it out by accident. Raymond Burr's DA then takes the circumstantial evidence & makes it stick & Clifts character gets the electric chair.The irony of this film is that Clift wants it all, 2 women & the American Dream. That leads to his downfall. Our modern society has changed now to the point that everybody today wants it all. This is not a safe path for our society now & this film illustrates that point when it goes terrible wrong. Everybody wanting it all is going to lead us to our own death & destruction which makes all of us now parallel with Clifts character.His destruction symbolizes where we are all headed, & it is a scary place, with terrorism & all that comes with it. Don't forget, there are people with the view that counters this plot, that a man having only one woman (wife) just isn't civilized. We have someone running for President who supported bigamy by looking the other way(several times), so next why not a judge? Fine work by George Stevens producing a thought provoking drama.

True this is a film about the very different thoughts of male and female relationships, but much more can be found like finding yourself and it is important to find what makes you happy. Also this film was made at a time that pushed the sexual boundaries to new limits, Mike Nichols shows that he's not worried about pushing the envelope to the next level. The early 70's was a time when this kind of material was just new on the scene and this picture caused an uproar about obscene behavior, but the film had scenes that were done in an artistic way even when it had nude scenes Nichols didn't make them obscene.Jonathan Fuerst(Jack Nicholson) and Sandy(Art Garfunkel) are two college roommates who are eager beavers to explore ladies and sex, Jonathan is a open-minded extrovert and Sandy is an introvert who's more cautious. Anyway the dating begins when both encounter a young and conservative girl named Susan(Candice Bergen in one of her earliest roles) then the love and sex start for all three. As Jonathan breaks off going another direction that being his wild ways, while Sandy later weds Susan.The film then starts to span the generations showing both male characters who are strong and tell their take on relationships from their point of view in first person. Then we are introduced to the mature and very voluptuous and sexy kitten Bobbie(Ann-Margret who's at her all-time sexy best!) Bobbie becomes the lover of Jonathan who's still sex driven and enjoys his time in bed he would never throw her out! Only then the film takes it's first point to show the big differences between the male and female mind thoughts. As Bobbie wants marriage and family but that is a no for Jonathan, who's happy just loving and enjoying his pleasure that makes him feel good within. As the film goes along good friend Sandy continues to enjoy marriage even after he departed with Susan, but for his good friend John the settling down thing will just never work. As the film ends with both men being happy from within.A good overall view of Carnal Knowledge is that from the very beginning it's a film not worried about expressing things as from the opening credits one can tell it's a hormone driven film. But Nichols does this theme of sexual freedom in a professional manner with very mature and strong characters, having them to share their thoughts make the film so interesting. And the nude and love scenes are a great tease to audiences, that makes anyone watching feel good pleasure and think sexual freedom will become a good thing. And Mike Nichols sure opened doors with this film that causal sex can be OK and he shows that many characters can be happy even if they never find any true love. Nichols proves point with this film that males are more sex driven, and females care more about love. Jack Nicholson is top notch as always, giving a tough character performance that includes wit, humor, toughness and good emotional anger while all along being happy with himself as a man who obsesses with women.

But the new counselors find that in between drinking, smoking weed and having sex there is someone who is not ready to have the camp be disturbed.Let me lay the awful truth out there this is a horrible film. Star Betsy Palmer called it a piece of (excrement) and she is flatly right. The acting is nothing special, the plot is really thin and not very clever. At times -- especially towards the end -- it does not even make sense. What makes slasher horror great is typically the gore. But even that is lacking here -- the gore is pretty weak, with most deaths being off-screen or from cheesy angles.Yet, despite Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street being the better series, and this film's reliance on Black Christmas for inspiration, I have long considered the Friday the 13th franchise to be my favorite. I cannot justify it with the poor plots (basically the same thing happens in all eleven of the films) but I just cannot say no to these movies.Which is not to say nothing good came of them. Jason Voorhees is now a well-known pop culture figure, surpassing Michael Myers by a long shot. Kevin Bacon made an appearance here as Jack before anyone thought that boy could be a star. Sean Cunningham directed, and despite his Last House of the Left being the better film, and went on to make a living from this series. As did Victor Miller, who was an unheard of writer before this.And perhaps even more than Halloween, this film really launched the slasher craze of the 1980s. The stereotype is a bunch of kids in the woods getting hacked up, not a trio of babysitters being stalked by a station wagon. So, despite its shortcomings, it still deserves credit for everything it inspired.While the gore is minimal, I have to give some credit to Tom Savini. He made due with what he was given, and is even credited as the man who invented Jason Voorhees, which I think makes him somewhat of a hero in the world of horror (besides already being an icon for his amazing makeup and effects). He served as a stunt man and stand-in for the film, too, making this very much his baby.Adrienne King appears, and this is almost her last job in Hollywood due to an obsessed fan. With all respect to Ms. King, this just adds to the element of the film beautiful young women appears in horror film, only to never star in movies again because of a stalker. This is the stuff legends are made of. (She did return to acting in the 2000s, but primarily in low-budget films.)And last but not least, the first of three appearances by Crazy Ralph, who is by far my favorite character from the series (even more than Jason himself or Tommy Jarvis). His doomed lines are horror classics now, and they even went so far as to try and get a new Ralphesque character for Part Three (a big mistake, and maybe I will explain this more in my review for that one).Anyway, you are going to want to see this one if you are a horror fan simply for the classic status it now has. But the sad truth is that you should not expect much. As I said, the other major franchises just blow this one away. Even Sleepaway Camp, which was clearly trying to cash in on this film, is debatably the better (or at least more entertaining) film. Although, I think this still beats Memorial Valley Massacre.

Well, someone in that camp just can't wait to get more than a peek with them...I entitled this review let the nonsense begin because this is the part of the series where you have to turn your brain off almost completely. Jason is played by something like five different people over the next two or three films, so he constantly looks like a different guy. He seems capable of shopping at nice stores (look at those shoes) without being able to talk, earn money or drive a car. More than half the counselors in this film disappear and nobody ever bothers to mention this (I think the next film says there is one survivor, but I could point out at least nine, especially one man who goes to the bar before the killings). And the biggest nonsense of all a killer I have to assume is Jason that tracks Alice down to the city and is able to find her address and phone number. Without being detected. Amazing! Nonsense aside, there are some positive things to be said here. This is the first film directed by Steve Miner (producer of the first film), who also does Part Three and does later horror films House and Halloween H20 to name a few. So he is a horror icon through and through. Adrienne King returns in a weird green jumper. And we even have the return of Crazy Ralph (Walt Gorney), uttering what for me is his best line I told the others but they didn't believe me. You're doomed, all doomed. (or something similar) More nonsense includes how someone can look like an old woman just by wearing a sweater, or how that person knew that wearing such a sweater would make them look like that person. But I think I have said enough about the nonsense...This film introduces the adult Jason Voorhees, although a strange version of him with a sack over his head (apparently an homage to The Town That Dreaded Sundown). We also have character Ginny Field (Amy Steel), who briefly returns in part three and Sandra Dier who plays a key role in part four. So some aspects of the next few films are set up in this one. Oh, and this also features the completely pointless six minute flashback that becomes a staple for the next few films. On the plus side, there is a reference to Mario Bava's Bay of Blood and a debut role for Stuart Charno, who later appeared in Sleepwalkers and Christine.Otherwise, this is really more of the same. Kids hacked up in a wilderness camp. Lights going out. And the same music that at times is such an obvious ripoff of Psycho that it is sickening -- even worse a ripoff than the music from Re-Animator (or at least as bad). But if you liked the first one and want to see more hacked up kids or want to find out what happened to Alice Hardy or Crazy Ralph, here you have a chance for that.

Jason is played by something like five different people over the next two or three films, so he constantly looks like a different guy. He seems capable of shopping at nice stores (look at those shoes) without being able to talk, earn money or drive a car. More than half the counselors in this film disappear and nobody ever bothers to mention this (I think the next film says there is one survivor, but I could point out at least nine, especially one man who goes to the bar before the killings). And the biggest nonsense of all a killer I have to assume is Jason that tracks Alice down to the city and is able to find her address and phone number. Without being detected. Amazing! Nonsense aside, there are some positive things to be said here. This is the first film directed by Steve Miner (producer of the first film), who also does Part Three and does later horror films House and Halloween H20 to name a few. So he is a horror icon through and through. Adrienne King returns in a weird green jumper. And we even have the return of Crazy Ralph (Walt Gorney), uttering what for me is his best line I told the others but they didn't believe me. You're doomed, all doomed. (or something similar) More nonsense includes how someone can look like an old woman just by wearing a sweater, or how that person knew that wearing such a sweater would make them look like that person. But I think I have said enough about the nonsense...This film introduces the adult Jason Voorhees, although a strange version of him with a sack over his head (apparently an homage to The Town That Dreaded Sundown). We also have character Ginny Field (Amy Steel), who briefly returns in part three and Sandra Dier who plays a key role in part four. So some aspects of the next few films are set up in this one. Oh, and this also features the completely pointless six minute flashback that becomes a staple for the next few films. On the plus side, there is a reference to Mario Bava's Bay of Blood and a debut role for Stuart Charno, who later appeared in Sleepwalkers and Christine.Otherwise, this is really more of the same. Kids hacked up in a wilderness camp. Lights going out. And the same music that at times is such an obvious ripoff of Psycho that it is sickening -- even worse a ripoff than the music from Re-Animator (or at least as bad). But if you liked the first one and want to see more hacked up kids or want to find out what happened to Alice Hardy or Crazy Ralph, here you have a chance for that.

Another thing that could have worked against the film is that it is immediately obvious that they had a much higher budget and there is a slickness that wasn't present in the original. The relative crudeness of FRANKENSTEIN worked in its favor; the smaller budget and lack of a score only added to its weirdness.Fortunately, James Whale overcame all of these factors (including his initial reluctance) and delivered not only one of the greatest horror films ever made, but probably one of the greatest films ever made in any genre. Just compare the scene of Frankenstein and Pretorius bringing the Bride to life to the equivalent creation scene in the original movie and you'll see how they ramped everything up to a whole new level for this picture. The editing, the production design, the sets, the performances, are so over the top yet dead on it almost creates a giddiness or a frenzied feeling for the viewer. In fact, as the movie progresses, the editing becomes more frantic, the camera angles more abstract, the overall effect more otherworldly. By the creation scene, the film feels half-crazed, the viewer somehow intoxicated. Ernest Thesiger as Pretorius as absolutely brilliant, his performance equaling that of any contemporary actor, and Colin Clive delivers yet another delightfully manic performance as a Henry Frankenstein torn between what is morally right and scientific curiosity. But of course it is Boris Karloff who gives an outstanding performance as the Monster (duly credited this time instead of being billed as ? as he was in the first movie), one that may even bring you to tears he when befriends a blind hermit.There is a great deal more humor in this film, most of it delivered by Thesiger in laugh-out-loud lines that are not funny at all taken out of context (You're wise in your generation for example), and I don't want to ruin any of the witty and florid dialogue for you. The film careens wildly from humor to pathos, creepiness to zaniness, in a roller coaster ride of styles and emotions. The slickness doesn't detract from the atmosphere, and since the first film was an enormous hit for Universal, to try and duplicate the low-budget look of the first film would have been pretentious.This is just about as close to a perfect movie that one will encounter, and certainly a perfect Universal horror flick.

Balto has a great storyline, colorful characters, decent animation, and a powerful soundtrack. The only thing this movie lacked was big stars, which is what seems to decide how good a movie is these days. It's such a shame that people will dismiss any movie just because the actors or staff is not well known. Balto is one of these examples (for the exception of Kevin Bacon, but even he is no Johnny Depp in the popularity contest).What I like most about the film are the characters. The characters are dynamic and show much expression. It gives the animation a very 3D feel if the characters speak to you.Good animation is hard to find these days. People are slowly forgetting the joys of hand drawn animation. Computer animation is what runs family flicks. Balto is guilty of some computer animation but they blend it in nicely.The storyline was well played out. Many people remark on the pace of the film. I agree that the pace was perfect. It didn't go too fast or too slow. It kept moving and kept you engaged.The soundtrack was excellent. One thing that I noticed about Balto was the soundtrack. It adds so much mood and life to the film. It also blends in. I don't remember any annoying repetitive theme, the music flows with the film. Tranquil during the calm parts and hard hitting during action. One thing I was worried about was that this movie would have some sort of song in there by a pop artist. These song sequences (most common in family flicks) can interrupt movies. To my pleasant surprise, there weren't any! Pure orchestra; the way it was intended.Family flicks have a challenge that many fail appeal to ALL ages. PIXAR is an example of a company that masters this. Ages from 6 to 60 loved PIXAR films. This is because they didn't make it too silly, but made it silly enough for the kiddies. On an A to F scale on how Balto performed, I would give it a B-. I could survive on the film, it brought me back to my childhood days. I just think that the Sled Dog Trio\/Steele's Gang and Muk & Luk brought a little immaturity, but only slightly.

It's such a shame that people will dismiss any movie just because the actors or staff is not well known. Balto is one of these examples (for the exception of Kevin Bacon, but even he is no Johnny Depp in the popularity contest).What I like most about the film are the characters. The characters are dynamic and show much expression. It gives the animation a very 3D feel if the characters speak to you.Good animation is hard to find these days.

It didn't go too fast or too slow. It kept moving and kept you engaged.The soundtrack was excellent. One thing that I noticed about Balto was the soundtrack. It adds so much mood and life to the film. It also blends in. I don't remember any annoying repetitive theme, the music flows with the film. Tranquil during the calm parts and hard hitting during action. One thing I was worried about was that this movie would have some sort of song in there by a pop artist. These song sequences (most common in family flicks) can interrupt movies. To my pleasant surprise, there weren't any! Pure orchestra; the way it was intended.Family flicks have a challenge that many fail appeal to ALL ages. PIXAR is an example of a company that masters this. Ages from 6 to 60 loved PIXAR films.

Viola, for protection, dresses up as a boy and goes to work for a powerful Duke (a very dashing Toby Stephens). When the Duke sends his new male servant to woo his love, Lady Olivia (the glamorous Helena Bonham Carter), all sorts of chaos reigns, especially when Viola's now identically looking twin brother arrives!!The actors give it their all and make the complicated Shakespearian language much easier to follow. The scenery is the breathtakingly beautiful Cornish coast and the overall feel of the play is one that has been made with great care, yet never tires or becomes bogged down with the complicated language. I had no idea of the story before watching, but found this no obstacle, unlike many other Shakespeare film adaptions. I've never been much of a Shakespeare fan and have only read it when made to in school!

Much like the car chase in Bullitt; its the part you remember years after you've forgotten the plot of the film.Nick Nolte is excellent as the tough but rather dumb cop commuting between mayhem zones in his tired and much abused Cadillac convertible. Most of the western-style action takes place in sleaze-bag honky-tonks and a brothel. Quite effective.Excellent action throughout but the broken-glass festival at the end is a little overdone. The fake streetcars are very unprofessional. Why spend so much money and effort on some scenes and then blow it on basic glitches like that? Movie audiences DO notice that sort of thing, just like airplane vapor trails in Westerns, so stay on the ball, Hollywood.Speaking of balls, my favorite scene in this film is the one where Eddie Murphy gets the drop on Nick Nolte with a basketball ! Either Nolte is a very good actor or he really didn't know it was coming. Maybe both. Try doing 20 takes of that scene sometime.Perennial villain Ed O'Ross (Red Heat, Universal Soldier) is in there as one of the bad cops and duly gets drilled in the finale.

Instead of wasting time with pointless exposition (title crawl excepted, of course), the film starts right in with two of the main stories-- Vader's pursuit of Luke and the Rebel forces going on the run after an astoundingly impressive battle scene between heavily armored walkers and the hopelessly out-gunned Alliance. Luke learns the way of the Jedi from Yoda, a wise, green, raspy alien who looks like the child of Kermit and Miss Piggy (which makes sense, considering Miss Piggy was also voiced by Frank Oz).The movie also shows Han, Chewie, Leia, and C-3PO running from the Empire in many well-visualized locales-- the asteroid field, the space slug, and Cloud City, among others. 3PO slapstick reaches a feverish high, and somehow that isn't half bad.Following suit for More American Graffiti (1979), Lucas leaves the director's chair for Irvin Kershner, whose almost terrifying directorial style is much better suited to this darker story. If only Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom could have been done more like this....

The story was a nice one, too, with no complaints about inappropriate language or behavior.Kevin Kline supplies many of the laughs, at least with me. I preferred him over John Lithgow or Jim Broadbent.This is supposedly based on a true story but I am going to assume they took a lot of liberties with it. Nonetheless, it's a story and a decent for the whole family, as the cliché goes. However, I think this is mostly appealing to females. I found it pleasant, but more of a chick flick than a guy's film. Thus, I doubt I would watch it again, especially knowing the surprise ending.I definitely recommend this comedy-drama-romance for people who haven't seen it, and for most people who are not adult males.

Well, no, the whole problem with 'Toys' is that it forgets to entertain. Adults would find the story too empty and simple, with cheap laughs and a very childish undercurrent. Too boring for small children and too far out there for teens. However small children, teens and adults are all united in scratching their heads in confusion while wondering exactly where all this is all going and why. After a while I for one couldn't care. So when the director shouted 'that's a wrap!' and they all walked away patting each other on the back, they forgot that the film is meant to entertain. I saw this at the cinema and then watched it again on DVD (why?!?!), still don't like it though.

Recently, however, I viewed the 1998 remake (see my IMDb comment on it), and I wanted to see the original again for comparison, which I now have done.It's hard to evaluate this movie on its own, as this is one of those, perhaps rare, instances wherein the remake is better than the original. Technology advances (and perhaps a bigger budget) aside, and without going into detail, let me merely observe that the remake reworks and updates this original, improving upon it in the process, most notably in characterizations, in certain casting for better chemistry, and in the script.Wherever there are scene-for-scene comparisons, more often than not I prefer those in the remake. By deleting several outdated scenes, situations, and attitudes, the remake was able to expand some of the better scenes from this movie. The extended trashing of the cabin near the beginning of the movie would be but one example -- they perform pranks in the 1998 version that we never would have thought of in 1961.One of the better scenes here, however hokey it may seem today, is when the twins perform a piano-guitar duet for their parents at the re-enactment dinner. (I don't recall Lindsay Lohan's musical talents being utilized at all in the later version.) Although I would continue to recommend this movie, if you can see only one, see the remake (as opposed to The Parent Trap II, which is a made-for-TV dozer).
