Although I like movies I had never heard of this picture before. The opening scene with the two people on a first date was excellent. The two actors played it to perfection. I laughed out loud. I don't want to spoil it for any who have not seen it. But it was so human and so funny. But human first. We have, or at least I, have come to expect now, nothing but Superhero movies from Hollywood. (I use that word as a catchall, sorry).I like superhero's, loved Batman Begins, but such rather removes one from the human condition. The last film that brought our condition back to me was 'The Hours.', but that by comparison to this sinks like an old Disney feel good. All the actors are billiento. The talks between father and son are the most honest that I have seen - never experienced - but also I have never seen on film either. Unfortunately my tape run out so I only got up to the point where the kid was being interviewed by the cops about his forgotten rape. Then the bloody tape ran out. But I had got Donny Darko before that. Also a good movie, but also again nothing compared to this piece of fine work.Yet, I have to admit that the best moment for me was when the hysterical woman walked in and spat at the skinny girl. Who the 'f**k' was she!!! I know because I have looked at the cast listing. Her name is Hope Pomerance. Is that some name or is it some name! This is a great film, a rare one that should be shown to everyone.But, Hope - what a woman! You know when you first see someone - BANG! And the movie? BANG! too.

The desolate landscape reflects the loneliness and isolation that permeates through the entire movie; a sense of lost and despair, a basic mood of pessimism that lasts till the very near end of movie where we got a glimpse of a future that holds promise through the actions and thoughts of Ouyang and of course a flash foreword, that shows the future of the characters. The action scenes are in a word, WOW. Wow in the sense that I have never seen it done like that before. All the actions scenes I have seen all involves the action being seen properly. Every punch, kick, slashes and chop are seen and most of the time emphasised through slow motion. However, in Ashes of Time except for one scene all the fight scenes are shot in trademark Wong Kar Wai style strobing effect where everything is just a blur. That really blew me away as I felt like I was actually in the fight with everything going at breakneck speed with hardly anytime to react. The story or rather what the film conveys is very thought invoking, like a typical Wong Kar Wai film every time you see the film you discover something new. You would discover another piece of the jigsaw puzzle that is a Wong Kar Wai movie and only through multiple viewings would you be able to piece together the whole story. Like all his films the movie is more about the form, the film itself rather then the story, the story at times seems to be an afterthought a side dish to the main course of the visual feast of cinematography, art direction and sound to provide the audience with a lingering sense of mood, of feeling. It makes you reflect on your own views on life and love and for me the similar sense of disenchantment that I share with the characters. Things like the best way to avoid rejection is to reject others first, or if you have to lose something, the best way is to keep it in your memories. It also makes you realise and reflect upon the fact that the consequences of any action you take do not affect only yourself but the people around you as well. The part on Hong Qi and his actions strikes me a lot and that happened only at the last of my numerous viewings and that is his courage. Would you have the courage to be yourself, to go after your own dreams even if the cost is great? It is this ability to involve the audience to make them think way after they have seen the film and to make go see the film again and again which makes this film great. The sense of familiarity, that makes people go I feel the same way or I know someone who is like that. it just sorts of brings the movie closer to you to make you feel involved like the characters are acting out your life in a weird way.

This movie is brilliant as it shows two actors in great performances like Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster. But these two have become so overrated, that we even, sometimes, may forget the others from the great cast, like Ted Levine, Anthony Heald and Brooke Smith, all of them in great performances. I tried to watch this movie for the second time without anything nearby disturbing me like sounds, phone conversations and lights turning on and off. Glad I am as those things didn't happen the first time I watched it, so I could absorb the movie quite well. In conditions like that, I became completely frozen when I saw Hannibal Lecter for the first time, on screen, standing up, still, in that green prisoner outfit, in his prison cell, saying only Good Morning.Well, Hopkins has proved himself he can deliver quite a good performance, whether he stands still or not, whether he's silence of not. The movie features many brilliant scenes like Lecter's escape from his cell in the police department, his conversations with Agent Clarice Starling and the breathtaking few scenes of Catherine Martin screaming for being held hostage by the never ending sinister psychopath, Buffalo Bill, played by Levine.The Silence Of The Lambs' plot is one many people might already know. But this review, of course, like all my others, are intended to be read by people who have already watched the movie. Foster goes on an assignment to meet Hannibal Lecter and take from him clues in order to catch the assassin. But Lecter gives Starling the chance for them to perform the quid pro quo, which suggests that whenever he gives her information, she will have to tell him about her life. This makes character developing take place in most of the entire movie.This won 5 Oscars, as I think it deserved. The only thing I didn't like in it was when Foster withdrew her pistol in order to arrest Buffalo Bill, as she did it very slow, a minus for a winning performance like Foster's. But that's the only bad thing about this movie. What counts is the presence of professional people like Foster, Hopkins, Smith, Levine, and of course, the director Jonathan Demme.

Rather it's about a prostitute who actually grows as a person. That's plausible. It can happen. In this movie it does happen. And that is the rub. The movie is on thin ice here because the audience has to accept the premise that a prostitute can actually learn to care about her john, which is asking a lot from the audience.

She was the right choice for the role; she makes the character believable. Another actress may have played the role differently with different, less satisfying results.Can a prostitute fall in love?

This scenario is entirely plausible. Total strangers meet under the most improbable circumstances and fall in love. This formula is classic Hollywood and in this movie the actors make it work. The man treats the woman decently and she responds. That makes for a good story. The audience wants the relationship to work. This is a wonderful, upbeat movie, about two people who actually learn to care about each other. The man is a rich, cynical business man; the woman is a prostitute. What starts out as a business proposition evolves into something special, as the two characters evolve and reveal aspects of themselves that are endearing and engaging. At the start of the movie, both characters have contempt for the opposite sex. The man is in the middle of getting a divorce; for the woman, men are mere customers, nothing more. But when they meet, the chemistry is instantaneous.

The happy ending made a comeback, as did such traditional values as the success ethic. Despite Rocky not being the sharpest tool in the box, he was tough and goal oriented and had that hungry look for the title. To be an average Joe off the streets and turned into the heavy weight champion of the world is incredible. I think that was what was so appealing to Rocky.This is Sylvester's best work in my opinion, and that's actually a compliment. He did a terrific job as Rocky. I loved the chemistry between him and Adrien, a shy girl who just needs a little push and encouragement to be someone magnificent. Rocky is just a great all around feel good movie that makes you want to go the distance.

One is that I will always hate Andrew Lloyd Webber and another is that Madonna will never be a good actress. After seeing Alan Parker's 1996 musical Evita however, starring Madonna and featuring the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber, I have had to amend those two statements slightly.Evita tells the true story of Eva Peron, the wife of Argentina's former president (and dictator) Juan Peron. In a story that was ready-made for Hollywood, she started out as the illegitimate and poor daughter of a man who dies when she is very young, sleeps with a mediocre nightclub singer at the age of 15 in order to gain passage to Buenos Aires, and from there begins her struggle to reach whatever achievements her ambitions require (which is a lot). Using her body to gain important friends (because, frankly, she didn't have any acting talent) she becomes an actress and radio star before she meets Juan Peron, at the time, an up and coming politician. They get married and the two work to get him elected as the president of Argentina on the platform that they are workers too. When he is elected, Evita's popularity grows even more, to the point where her dreams of becoming the vice president of the country could be realized, until she is stricken with cancer and dies, essentially with the image of a saint, at the age of 32.Evita is a gorgeous, lush film, full of thousands of extras, great location scenes and features a very talented cast. It acts almost as an incredibly big budgeted and elaborate music video, mainly because it features almost constant singing, and well, it stars one of the most visible music video stars of all time. Madonna finally found her part in this film, and no, it wasn't just easier because she didn't have a lot of speaking lines. It is clear that not only did she take voice lessons (which actually is true) because her voice quality was better than normal, and has stayed that way since the making of this film, but she was able to knock off some decent dramatic moments. Banderas, though he spent a lot of the film looking pretty furious with the camera, doesn't have to prove any acting mettle (anyone who has seen him in an Almodovar film can attest to this) but did come up with a surprisingly good singing voice. Jonathan Pryce, who was curiously cast as Peron also did a good job, though his part was fairly minor, and even at that he was relegated to giving Evita a lot of loving looks. All in all, however, the slick production, some catchy music (I cannot believe I am actually saying that I actually really like a film featuring the music of the insipid, mainstream, gnome-like Webber) that is good enough to listen to extra-curricularly and performances that weren't bad made for a pretty good and very entertaining viewing.Don't get me wrong &#150; there are more than a few eye-rolling moments in Evita, but the good definitely outweighs the bad, exponentially. The story, while coherent, was pretty mediocre, and I found that I felt that there were some things that were glossed over or trivialized with a cute musical number. Admittedly, however, this IS a musical and you don't sign up for a hard-hitting knowledge fest when you watch one. This wasn't the first time I had seen this film, and yet I still end up getting so wrapped up in the action that I end up bawling a couple of times, and this viewing was no exception. More importantly, though, I didn't feel like a doofus when I recommended it as a movie that three guys and I should watch together, because while it's slick and a musical, (and therefore, traditionally, a chick film) there's enough compelling elements to the film that will keep some guys happy as well.

When he is elected, Evita's popularity grows even more, to the point where her dreams of becoming the vice president of the country could be realized, until she is stricken with cancer and dies, essentially with the image of a saint, at the age of 32.Evita is a gorgeous, lush film, full of thousands of extras, great location scenes and features a very talented cast. It acts almost as an incredibly big budgeted and elaborate music video, mainly because it features almost constant singing, and well, it stars one of the most visible music video stars of all time. Madonna finally found her part in this film, and no, it wasn't just easier because she didn't have a lot of speaking lines. It is clear that not only did she take voice lessons (which actually is true) because her voice quality was better than normal, and has stayed that way since the making of this film, but she was able to knock off some decent dramatic moments. Banderas, though he spent a lot of the film looking pretty furious with the camera, doesn't have to prove any acting mettle (anyone who has seen him in an Almodovar film can attest to this) but did come up with a surprisingly good singing voice. Jonathan Pryce, who was curiously cast as Peron also did a good job, though his part was fairly minor, and even at that he was relegated to giving Evita a lot of loving looks. All in all, however, the slick production, some catchy music (I cannot believe I am actually saying that I actually really like a film featuring the music of the insipid, mainstream, gnome-like Webber) that is good enough to listen to extra-curricularly and performances that weren't bad made for a pretty good and very entertaining viewing.Don't get me wrong &#150; there are more than a few eye-rolling moments in Evita, but the good definitely outweighs the bad, exponentially. The story, while coherent, was pretty mediocre, and I found that I felt that there were some things that were glossed over or trivialized with a cute musical number. Admittedly, however, this IS a musical and you don't sign up for a hard-hitting knowledge fest when you watch one. This wasn't the first time I had seen this film, and yet I still end up getting so wrapped up in the action that I end up bawling a couple of times, and this viewing was no exception. More importantly, though, I didn't feel like a doofus when I recommended it as a movie that three guys and I should watch together, because while it's slick and a musical, (and therefore, traditionally, a chick film) there's enough compelling elements to the film that will keep some guys happy as well. Good job, Parker and thanks a lot for blowing two of the absolutes I normally stand by. 6\/10 --Shelly ","genre":"Biography, Drama, History"},{"date":"8 August 2005","score":"4 out of 12 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a wicked action film, with some great surfboarding and sky diving stunts, with amazing performances from Keanu Reeves , Gary Busey and Patrick Swayze!.

The primary reason to see Before Sunrise, is to watch a young Julie Delpy deliver her lines. As Celine, this sexy, brainy, soulful brown-eyed blond is sort of a cross between Brigitte Bardot and Joni Mitchell as they were in their mid-twenties. Risking overstatement, Celine is practically the ideal woman, unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural, unpretentious, introspective, and selflessly loving. We can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak, for her sincere, intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating. Further, her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks English with a French accent that is very endearing. If there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie, it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar. Ethan Hawke as Jessie comes off like a vaguely appealing slob, sort of a Maynard G. Krebs of the nineties. Attempting to appear detached and nonchalant, he sort of drags himself through certain shots. His pants fit poorly, his tee shirt is coming untucked, his wavy dark hair (his most attractive feature) needs a good washing, and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee. Nevertheless, he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a two-week train ride around Europe, so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine. His oft-cynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic Celine, although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation. When he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence, we know he is getting somewhere. After blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes, bars, and silly diversions, they agree that because they may never see one another again, they should make the most of it. Jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass, looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up. Given his boundless luck in the romance department, it is especially irksome when Jessie, as the very definition of a naive jerk, foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp. He contents himself with a half-baked plan, quickly devised at the railroad station when he bids her adieu, to reunite at the same spot in half a year. When the appointed time comes, you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another, perhaps even married and pregnant. For whatever reason, she probably won't show, while Jesse, who ends up working at Target or (if he's lucky) the local library, will go back to Vienna, desperate to see her again, only to wind up alone.Despite what for me was a very discouraging conclusion, Before Sunrise is a beautiful movie. I highly recommend both it and the sequel, Before Sunset. ","genre":null},{"date":"8 August 2005","score":"12 out of 18 people found the following review useful","review":" After a chance encounter on the train, a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of Vienna, discussing life and love. The primary reason to see Before Sunrise, is to watch a young Julie Delpy deliver her lines. As Celine, this sexy, brainy, soulful brown-eyed blond is sort of a cross between Brigitte Bardot and Joni Mitchell as they were in their mid-twenties. Risking overstatement, Celine is practically the ideal woman, unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural, unpretentious, introspective, and selflessly loving. We can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak, for her sincere, intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating. Further, her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks English with a French accent that is very endearing. If there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie, it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar. Ethan Hawke as Jessie comes off like a vaguely appealing slob, sort of a Maynard G. Krebs of the nineties. Attempting to appear detached and nonchalant, he sort of drags himself through certain shots. His pants fit poorly, his tee shirt is coming untucked, his wavy dark hair (his most attractive feature) needs a good washing, and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee. Nevertheless, he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a two-week train ride around Europe, so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine. His oft-cynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic Celine, although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation. When he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence, we know he is getting somewhere. After blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes, bars, and silly diversions, they agree that because they may never see one another again, they should make the most of it. Jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass, looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up. Given his boundless luck in the romance department, it is especially irksome when Jessie, as the very definition of a naive jerk, foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp.

The movie provokes different emotions because it's something you haven't seen before in the genre. Even though that Carpenter's film is more Sci-Fi oriented, it delivers some truly frightening and tense moments that make it fit into the Horror genre. The story is as original as you can get. It's clever, scary, and sets you in a world of fear, fantasy, and tension. I really praise Mr. Carpenter for creating a story that involves fictional history facts, a tale about revenge, and a feeling of adventure through the movie.The settings are impressive, and that's the main reason to watch the movie on DVD. The settings of the movie are beautifully dark, and when the fog appears the movie really looks creepy. Carpenter's camera angles are stunning, perfect if you say. From the beginning you know that you're watching a perfectly directed movie. The movie's only weakness in my opinion, is it's slow development. It doesn't takes too long before a jump-out of your scene, or a death scene but some scenes steal some dynamic. That's just my opinion.The acting is excellent. Barbeau gives the best performance in the movie and that's a lot to say because a very hot Jamie Lee Curtis gives a great performance also. The rest of the cast is fine and take their roles seriously. Janet Leigh is a delight to watch as always. I really enjoy when I get to care about the characters of a movie and this happens in The Fog. The elegant and well structured character development in the movie make it a different experience. The score is good as in every John Carpenter movie. Maybe it's me, but it's very similar to Halloween's.The Fog delivers expectations and has some impressive scenes in the genre. The ending is chilling and satisfactory. The church attack is magnificent. The scenes where the fog attacks the residents of Antonio Bay are stuff for legend. The movie also has some gore , not to satisfy gore hounds but works for the movie. I would recommend this movie to any Horror fan even that it's not a 100% Horror movie. The Fog is a classic and a must see. Probably not Carpenter's best (depending on opinions) but still a creepy, intelligent, and visually stunning movie.
