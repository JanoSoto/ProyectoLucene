As the director and lead actor, Benigni will have you crying with laughter throughout the movie with his comical actions and remarks. Produced in 1997, Life is Beautiful had the power to make a high school student enjoy an older film while feeling the wrath of how horrific the Holocaust was.This film has a series of important events that leads up to the end. In the beginning of the film, Benigni plays Guido, an Italian waiter who seems to know everyone. Guido is a light minded man who is always in the right place at the right time. All throughout the beginning, Guido runs into a young woman named Dora, who is played by Nicoletta Braschi. Guido has lots of interest in this young woman who he calls principessa and is always sweeping her off her feet. Eventually they end up falling in love and having a son that will have you saying, aw, every time he is on the screen.When all seems to be going perfect, Guido and his son are taken away by the Nazi forces to a camp. His wife rushes to get to them and is also taken to the camp. This is where Benigni's comedic talents really shine. While in the camps, Guido and his son are separated from Dora and Guido decides to turn the sore reality of being at the camp into a game to keep his son safe and happy at the same time. He explains how the grand prize of the game is a real tank, which keeps his son wanting to stay in the game. While in the camp, Guido always finds a way to make his son be happy and believe that everything is going to be okay. To find out if Giosue wins grand prize and if Guido ever reunites with his wife again, you are just going to have to watch this magnificent film that may leave you with tears of joy and sadness.This movie truly is an inspiring story about someone who is put in a bad situation and does everything he can to make it seem like a normal situation, all for his cute little son. In a lot of ways the movie life is Beautiful is like the Holocaust comic, Maus, written by Art Spiegelman. The comic Maus, is a story about a father who had to go beyond measures to keep him and his wife safe during the Holocaust and how it affected him many years after. Both show the drastic levels that people had to go through in order to stay alive during the Holocaust. They also both use great viewing techniques such as the angle of the shot, up close shots to show certain emotions, and shading\/darkness to enhance the importance within the stories. Both were well written stories, but the big difference between the two that makes Life is Beautiful more appealing is the comic relief that it provides to someone who is watching it.Although this film has some heartbreaking and jaw dropping scenes, it is a movie that will inspire you.

The film starts with Jenny Fields, Glenn Close as the central character, she's the caring and loving mother of Garp, but it's only until we hear the context of his conception that we realize the child was promised to a very peculiar destiny.Should I describe how Garp was born? This is one of the film's many surprises that pop up between two or three 'normal' scenes. But the intriguing parts are indeed so intriguing that we tend to believe this Garp is exceptional, a sort of autistic child floating within his own reverie. The film starts with a memorable animated sequence featuring Garp with his unknown father, a jet-pilot during WWII who died before he was born. While both father and son are fighting in the air a monster-like death, the surrealistic sequence brings some poetry to the movie, illustrating the capacity of a child to conceal hidden wounds through imagination. This is one of the inspirational messages I could relate to  inspiration and imagination do exorcise inner demons, especially during childhood.Then, when the young Garp turns out to be a wannabe writer, I'm not surprised, but the fact that he is a normal kind of disappoints me. I didn't know what to expect either, with this misleading shot of Robin Williams smiling at the sky. Finally, I'm glad he was a rather nice and serious guy, I don't think I could have endured the typical Robin Williams for two hours. Maybe it's the title that misled me, referring to the world rather than Garp, it's not even the world from his perspective, but simply the world that revolves around him. Garp is not a passive person although he has one characteristic that undermines his freedom of acts, the mother's influence. Glenn Close plays a strong-willed, independent nurse, with an ambiguous relationship with her son, angry when he lusts toward his future wife, played by Mary Beth Hurt, and eager to follow him to discover the world. She's supportive and caring but maybe a bit too much.And when Garp decides to become a writer, his turning point strangely coincides with his mother's. Since nothing special happened to him so far, he writes about his mother, what she totally disapproves stating that only she has the right to write about herself. Then Garp becomes a fictional writer, specializing on short stories, and Jenny writes a feminist manifesto based on her own experience and titled Sexual Suspects. Inspired from her own experience and many encounters in the big city, Jenny became a political phenomenon, a cult idol, while Garp, less successful but more critically praised can only resign to the satisfaction of being a writer, and at least, being as successful as a family man. After all, who can complain about accomplishing a personal dream and being able to live through it? And it's at that point that no matter how disjointed and peculiar some scenes were, I was immersed in the story of Garp following the little world of so many memorable characters. Those who stick to mind are Roberta, an ex-football athlete who became a woman John Lithgow is absolutely remarkable, beyond believability, what starts as a gag turns out to be a poignant and sweet performance, Roberta is immediately accepted by the family, by Garp, and Lithgow has such a way to play it, we never feel it unrealistic. There is also 'Poo', the sister of Garp's childhood love-life, a jealous mute girl characterized by big horn-rimmed glasses and an incapability to smile, to life and in general , the closest figure to an antagonist, her appearances suggest a misfortune to happen, but the film is so full of them that we're never really off-guard and always expect a disaster to happen.There is also a very interesting sub-story involving a group of feminist who called themselves, the Ellen Jamesians in homage to Ellen James, a young girl who was not only raped, but had her tongue cut-off by her rapists so she wouldn't give her names. To Garp's big shock, the feminist voluntarily cut their tongue, An act of desperate unison rather than self-mutilation, but the way Garp perceives it, these women are dangerous. Never judgmental, the film allows us to make up our own opinions ,adultery is also a recurrent theme, and the victims are not innocent. The film is a chronicle of things happening, and connecting to each other, for the best and sometimes for the worse, and for a worse that can be devastating or hilarious. George Roy Hill's direction, either deliberately or not, use a lot of suspense without forcing.And oddly enough, it's because we feel bad omens and sad events that were grabbed to the story and enjoy the little moments of joy and tenderness. The movie teases our emotions but never forcing them, it also never patronizes us, but it's full of some insights. It kind of reminded me of Forrest Gump without the Pop-culture thing, a sort of picaresque journey within one's own world, indeed The World according to Garp. Robin Williams delivers one of his best performances, in all nuance and sobriety, while it's Glenn Close and John Lithgow who steal the show.And still, I feel I have to watch it again &#x85; the film is one strange adventure into life that deserves probably more than one viewing, I'm not sure I will find more answers, but there are some characters' motives that are still mysterious to me, and The World According to Garp is definitely worthy for more recognition.

Confidential has everything required for a blockbuster thriller of this type A majestic 50's L.A. backdrop; a straight-laced cop - and likewise, an unbridled one; a stunning blonde; A riveting murder case and numerous shoot-outs. As eager players of the video-game 'L.A. Noire' would know, creating a great backdrop is absolutely vital for a film like this, and both game and film really nailed it.A special credit to the casters, too, as Spacey plays the sleazy, egocentric cop far too well. This character was my favourite (although I would have liked to see some more action from him). As crime dramas go, the plot was not terribly complicated; A newly recruited police officer - Sergeant Edmund Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) is adamant he can become a legendary detective, just like his father. His intelligence, insistence on following regulations, and his cold demeanour contribute to his social isolation from other officers, which soon leaves him disliked amongst the division. Bud White (Crowe) plays the, and I quote (from Pearce's character), mindless thug and violent loving officer. Bud comes to dislike Ed after his partner, Dick Stensland, is fired due to Ed's testimony in the Bloody Christmas scandal. Bud is sought out by Dudley for a job intimidating out-of-town criminals trying to fill the void left in L.A. following the imprisonment of Mickey Cohen, the city's most successful and notorious gangster. The Nite Owl case becomes personal after Stensland is found to be one of the victims. Jack Vincennes (Spacey) moonlights as the technical adviser on Badge of Honor, a popular Dragnet-type TV crime program. He is also connected with Sid Hudgens (DeVito), publisher of Hush-Hush magazine, receiving kickbacks for tipping Sid off to celebrity arrests that will attract even more readers to the magazine. When a young actor winds up dead during one of these schemes, a guilt-ridden Jack is determined to find who did it. At different intervals, the three men investigate the Nite Owl killings and concurrent events which in turn begin to reveal indications of corruption all around them. Ed pursues absolute justice, all the while trying to live up to his family name. Bud pursues Nite Owl victim Susan Lefferts, which leads him to Lynn Bracken (Basinger), a Veronica Lake look-alike prostitute with ties to the case he and Ed are independently investigating. Meanwhile, Jack follows up on a pornography racket with ties to both the Nite Owl and Lynn's handler Pierce Patchett (Strathairn), operator of Fleur-de-Lis, a call-girl service that runs prostitutes altered by plastic surgery to resemble popular film stars.The story unfolds to reveal an unexpected twist - that LAPD Captain Dudley Smith (Cromwell) is behind all of it.In conclusion then, the plot was rather simple, but effective and capped off a fantastic neo-noire film that any fan of these iconic noire type crime dramas should be sure to watch.

He has this presence that, in my opinion has never been topped by any other Batman put to screen. This film delves into his origins and the reason he became Batman, which factor greatly in the story. I really liked what they did with Batman' origin. In my opinion, his origin is handled better here than in even Batman Begins.I also like Bruce's love interest, Andrea. She is different from most love interests in Batman. She strong and she can take care of herself. I also really bought into their love story, which also plays a big part in the. What I never liked about Batman films and superhero films in general, is that the love interests feel very tacked-on and forced as an attempt to bring in a broader audience. Here the love story is one of the driving factors of the movie.The Phantasm is a good villain. In fact, he is probably one of my favorite Batman villains. I loved the mystery surrounding the Phantasm. The way everything is unveiled is expertly done. The mystery is very complex, which is something you do not see in a lot of kids films, or even adult films. The Joker also appears in this. He is not the main villain, but definitely had a significant role to play. Mark Hamill's Joker is my favorite incarnation of the Joker.

The score is beautiful. Most of the music is from the animated series, but there is some new music here. Like the animated series, this movie takes a darker tone. This movie, like the animated series, treated its audience more like adults than the live action Batman movies coming out at the time.Overall, for anyone who is a fan of Batman, this is a must see. I think it is criminal that this film bombed at the box office when it was in theaters, while the childish Schumacher Batman films made all of the money.

It's going to be hard to follow up on any other movie after seeing Life Is Beautiful. Roberto Benigni fairly showed the true colors of a man who only wants what is best for his family by developing a character that not only uses his humor and love in the hardest of times, but also protects the innocence of his son Joshua (Georgio Cantarini). I especially enjoyed the setting of the film and how it took place in a colorful Italy and moved to a heartbreaking Nazi camp. The use of colors did not go unnoticed, along with the costumes. The time that went into such stitches made the movie seem that much more realistic and emotional. Also, the use of long shots throughout the film really added to the scenery which was absolutely beautiful. This film reminds me a lot of the book Maus. A father looking out for his son to one day tell him the truth of what it was really like for the Jews during WWII. However, Maus had a more serious take on the war and the camps compared to Life Is Beautiful where Benigni tried to create a false reality to make it easier for him and Joshua which was distressing and lifting at the same time. Another mechanic that did not go unnoticed was the editing involved in the production of the film. The scenes had great flow to them and were always easy to follow making the plot more interesting and appealing to the audience. The same goes for Maus, a great story board led to a great tale of the Nazi camps and the survival of Vladek Spiegelman. I highly suggest seeing this film if you are the type of person who loves a good script and outstanding performances by a brilliant cast. Even if you're are someone who doesn't think they would be interested in a foreign film, you should definitely see Life Is Beautiful.

The film is a seemingly endless thrill-ride, or better yet, a non-stop chase of a movie, with only elemental pauses and breaks that allow you to breath and take a moment to admire what you've witnessed. This sense of an endless chase can be attributed to the score of henchmen the main villain has at his disposal. Just when Bond had dealt with an adversary, another rears his head. From the cab driver to Baron Samedi, Tee Hee to Whisper, the film's cast of villains are all entertaining and it's great to watch Bond go up against them all. Moore himself is quite good. I don't mind the cold side he shows in the Hamilton entries. It shows that, despite his gentleman demeanour, he can still get the job done, whether it be dirty or clean. My only complain is that it could be truer to its source material. Live and Let Die is among my favourite of Fleming's novels, so I wouldn't mind a potential remake in the future.

This sense of an endless chase can be attributed to the score of henchmen the main villain has at his disposal. Just when Bond had dealt with an adversary, another rears his head. From the cab driver to Baron Samedi, Tee Hee to Whisper, the film's cast of villains are all entertaining and it's great to watch Bond go up against them all. Moore himself is quite good.

It's a black comedy with humor that is clever and really works and will grab your amusement till it's over. And even when it's over I couldn't help but think about certain scenes in this movie because of the memorable characters. It's a brash comedy but all the elements work well together in this. Because of this film Jeff Bridges will forever be known as The Dude. The Dude is this really mellow and laid back guy who isn't that bright or ambitious of a person. In fact he is unemployed and lazy while drinking White Russian but I couldn't help but like the guy. Also how he deals with his surrounding and his what the heck expressions is just priceless. He sort of reminded me of Homer Simpson from The Simpsons. And adds a lot of humor to this film. The story is basically about a Dude that gets tangled up in a situation because of a certain coincidence and becomes sort of a kidnapping investigation and the people around him constantly makes the situation worse for the guy. This is a very humorous comedy with quite a bit of satire that works. And has bunch of scenarios that interconnect very well near the end. John Goodman is also in this film and The Dude's best friend...Well only friend. And he plays this obnoxious loose-cannon type of character and he will probably forever be known for his role in this as well.

Soon they will meet their alleycat counterpart, a very gentleman-like one (male, of course), they enjoy a stint of adventures and a great big band revelry, then return home and sabotage the butler's scheme, easy and simple. Running within a succinct 78 minutes, this animation epitomises nearly every trademark of Disney, a children-prone narrative, an illuminating storyline, adorably main characters with quirky sidekicks, cartoony villains and most significantly an unerringly happy ending. But what's more conspicuous in this Walt Disney's last output is the music renditions, French chanson led by Maurice Chevalier's title song from the opening credits, marches with classical-adaptive show tunes and bookends with a Jazz-infused razzle-dazzle, all is done in nifty set pieces and nimble workmanship. Also the benign caricatures of bourgeois French (for example, the mother cat keeps claiming they're more than pets to their Madame, who will be totally alone in the world without them, although it may be the truth, but her tone of snobbish does niggle me quite a bit) and gormless British (the twin geese and their uncle) are simultaneously entertaining and cringeworthy. The voice cast is mellifluously solid, my own pick is Scatman Holloway's Scat Cat (a reincarnation and tribute of Louis Armstrong), while the action sequences between the butler and the two bandit dogs (Napoleon and Lafayette) are the high moment of the film, idiotic, yes, but masterfully concocted and slickly edited nonetheless, which nowadays has been substituted by grandiose spectacles in the mainstream animation branch. So, for me ruefully it has been too late to watch this film for the first time at my awkward adult age, it is pure fun but the aftertaste is also fun-sized, no soul-searching commentary could be extracted, after all, it is a bona fide Disney fare, it you dig the franchise, for sure you will like it.

The troops in Gitmo should show this movie to inmates but I am 100% confident it would be against the Geneva convention as it would undoubtedly be considered torture to have to sit through this movie.

I wish I could have that 2 hours of my life back as this has to be the worst major motion picture ever made.

Adam Sandler is not one of them. I don't care for his serious stuff, but there are times he appeals to my dork nature. I loved him in Airheads, Billy Madison, and Anger Management. But if actors want to improve their craft based on constructive criticism stop doing the stupid voices. It isn't funny. How studios back some movies, one can only guess. This movie is one of five that I just stopped watching because it was just that bad. Sadly, this is the only comedy I have turned off 15 minutes in (I waited 20 minutes for Date Movie). The timing was off,the plot was stupid, and I still want my 3 dollars back.
