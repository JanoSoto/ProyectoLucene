In real life she is a truly remarkable woman and on-screen, Roberts really made me believe that she was Brockovich in a way.In my opinion, this is Julia Roberts' best role. Roles in such movies as Pretty Woman, Notting Hill and Runaway Bride don't match this one. Erin Brockovich brought out the true talent which movie lovers know Roberts has. She acted it perfectly. Being stubborn, hard-working, aggressive emotional and caring, traits I'm sure the real Brockovich has.The story of this movie concentrates on  Erin Brockovich, who has 3 kids, divorced twice and a $17,000 debt after she loses her court case after a car accident. So Erin  looks and applies for a heaps of jobs, until she goes back to the lawyer who was representing her in court and begs for a job. After she is finally given a go, Erin searches into a small towns health crisis and brings a billion dollar company to its knees. The case that made Brockovich so famous was about  a processing plant called PG+E  which contaminated the water of a small town called Hinkley. The water supply was contaminated with Hexavalent Chromium, which can cause many terrible health problems, including Headaches, Nose Bleeds, cancers (of numerous kinds),  liver, heart and reproductive failure, organ deterioration and in bad cases death. So Brockovich, with no legal experience took on the case for the people of Hinkley and helped them win. In a way it was David taking on Goliath. I also loved the relationship between Erin and her boss Ed Masry. They treated each other with low regard, but in the end respected each other for who they were. Ed was played by Albert Finney and was well done.One part of the film I can understand people not liking is the relationship between Erin and bikie boyfriend George. It was destined  never to work as Erin was focusing more on her work for the case and not him. Maybe he was an unwanted character, but then again I saw George to be a kind man who helped Erin in her greatest time of need. Then we also see that Erin puts her kids needs behind to help others. Erin loved her kids, but her sense of justice meant her family life had to suffer.  There are some memorable quotes in Erin Brockovich, here are a few of my favorites`How &#145;bout this for a number. 6, is the age of my daughter, 8 is the age of son, 2 is the number of times I have been divorced and 16 is the number of dollars  in my bank account.' `That's all you got, lady. Two wrong feet. In f.....g ugly shoes.'`They're called boobs, Ed.'`Seeing as how I have no brains or legal expertise, I just went out there and performed sexual favors. Six hundred and thirty-four blow jobs in five days... I'm really quite tired.'`Not personal? That's my work in there. My Sweat, my time away from my kids..... if that's not personal, I don't know what is.'For those who have the facilities to watch DVDs, Erin Brockovich should be at the top of your list, with an impressive amount of special features including a report with Erin Brockovich herself (by the way look out for the real Brockovich in the movie) and half an hour of deleted scenes, which were interesting to see. All in all,  I hated the case and the pain those people had to endure, but I loved the way this true story was bought to the bigscreen. The courage of a single mother who felt so passionately about people who she had no ties with and wanted to see them have a new chance in life is truly inspirational.Rating 5 Stars or 10\/10.

","genre":"Biography, Drama"},{"date":"18 November 2000","score":"","review":"  A one-dimensional rating scale is not enough to measure some movies; people who are into pure action might want to stay away from as beautiful masterpieces as Eyes Wide Shut, people who are after drama might not necessarily want to see the violence in The Green Mile and those who want a love story will probably not want to sit through the dullness and apparent apathy of Bringing Out the Dead. For those of us who enjoy a change of format every now and then, though, Bringing Out the Dead is as beautiful a love story as Fight Club is a mystery one. I've seen this film twice now; the first time was in a theater in France, where the one notable thing was the translation of the F word to Mon dieu de la bordel de merde which is pretty funny in itself. The second time was yesterday on video. The major difference was this last time I was able to relate to what is really happening to Cage's character throughout the film because of me recently going through a similar phase in my life One of the themes of this film is how to deal with - and different ways to deal with - a very stressful profession which gives the story a lot of its pace with brilliant performances by the cast (and Marc Anthony and Ving Rhames adding a lot of flavor and humor to the film). What struck me, though - and the film's tagline should really have been different as far as I'm concerned; You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own - is the beautiful evolution we see Cage's character go through through the film. Starting out as an apathetic - almost robotic - body just going on driven by the fear of slowing down and facing his ghosts and life without drugs, things happen throughout the film to finally allow his brain and heart to recover and for him to really start living and feeling.Anybody who has been through a phase of their life where nothing can really touch them - a depression, drug abuse or just an unfortunate choice of workplace - should really be able to appreciate this film, and the - in relation to where the films or most depressions or drug abuses start out - amazingly brilliant and happy ending. I might be just projecting stuff here, and I know there are several other themes in this film, but this sense is what made this film really touch me and I will watch it several times more.
