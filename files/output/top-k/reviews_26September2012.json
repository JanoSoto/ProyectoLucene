I suspect that many reviewers who pan this film as a great 20 minute opening followed by a pointless and boring middle probably watched it expecting to see a slasher movie similar to Halloween. That's not what this movie is about; while it's true that its opening is justly famous, every bit as terrifying and memorable as you've always heard, When A Stranger Calls is less of a horror flick than a gritty, suspenseful crime drama who's characters and situations are scary and suspenseful but, unlike most slasher flicks, are also very realistic.The real star of this movie is not babysitter Jill Johnson (played adequately by a young Carol Kane), but rather the killer Curt Duncan. Duncan is not the superhuman killing machine usually seen in Hollywoodland; rather than the evil personified mold of Mike Myers or Jason Voorhees, his breed of insanity-and it is made clear that he is indeed completely insane-is the type one may encounter in the real world. He is a haunted shell of a man who is unable to understand or control his actions, and his pathetic appearance would illicit sympathy were his crime not so horrific; this is most likely what a mad serial killer REALLY looks like. No motive for what he's done is even hinted at, but while this lack of back story could easily have made for a 2-dimensional character, the well-written script allows for just enough development to make this killer seem very real. Actor Tony Beckley, who died shortly after filming completed, does an amazing job in this role; his vacant, pleading stares simultaneously invoke both pity and disgust from the audience. The film's other major character is the cop turned detective John Clifford. Charles Durning played roles similar to this in other films of the era, but never with a script as good as he's given here; while the burned out ex-cop is an archetype we've seen countless times, his actions in this film are highly believable, and the intelligence of the story in handling this character, who is complete with a healthy dose of clumsiness and self-doubt, create a sense of realism that is often missing from this archetype. The strongest aspect of When A Stranger Calls is the direction, which never allows any one element to go over the top; the story and the characters show a realistic sense of motivation and restraint in their actions. This low-key atmosphere, combined with some impressive long takes of seedy, neon tinted vintage Los Angeles streets, create a slow burn effect that increases the level of dread as the detective and the killer play cat and mouse. One of the movie's most horrifying scenes comes halfway through, when Clifford tells Tracy (an important secondary character played with superb realism by Colleen Dewhurst) about what REALLY happened that night; it's nothing more than a description of the crime scene, yet it is so revolting that even the most hard core audiences may cringe as they think back to what was going up upstairs in that house the night the hapless babysitter received those phone calls. Touches like this, which link the film's crime-pursuit middle to its slash- style opening, create a continuity that leads to a coherent and realistic film.--SPOILER ALERT-- The weakest point of When A Stranger Calls is the ending; this is where the previous subtly is abandoned for the more literal big finish Hollywood always seems to favor. I always thought it would have been much more frightening if the movie had ended right after Jill receives the phone call in the restaurant, but such an ending would probably have been too existential for most audiences. However, this a minor complaint; even with this literal wrap up, there's an still unexpected scare that will make almost anyone jump. Even here, the director showed enough restraint-if not subtlety-to bring a satisfying conclusion to a satisfying film. --END SPOILER ALERT--In the end, the worst thing that can be said about When A Stranger Calls is that it is schizophrenic film; it starts as a slasher movie and becomes a crime drama. Fortunately not all viewers see these genres as mutually exclusive, and I have seen few movies that combine the two as deftly as this one does. While it's true that countless slasher flicks of the 80's owe a debt to its first 20 minutes, it's my feeling that some more recent movies (Se7en, comes to mind) owe a debt to its portrayal of a weary cop determined to stop a crazed killer. If you sit down to watch When A Stranger Calls expecting to see a slasher movie, you may be disappointed, as so many of the reviewers that have posted here clearly were. If, on the other hand, you go into it expecting a suspenseful psychological crime drama with an intelligent script, believable characters, and imbued a heavy atmosphere of dread, you will come away rewarded.

It places America in the position of being the invaded land. That produces ironies throughout the film and allows viewers to see that people who aggress on other lands become occupiers. The people they are fighting become insurgents.The movie is about a Russian-Cuban-Nicaraguan-Hispanic invasion of America. A small group of American teenagers calling themselves Wolverines engages in guerrilla tactics against the occupiers. The Wolverines are insurgents. This is the major irony, and the screenwriters make the most of it.We get to see how different Americans react to the occupation. Some collaborate. Some defy the Russians and are killed or penned up. The Russians use the local mayor to help them rule.Colonel Bella (played by Ron O'Neal) is the local Spanish-speaking commander. An important irony is that he was once an insurgent himself who used guerrilla tactics, but now, to protect his men's lives, he orders them to travel outside secured areas only in squad size. This mirrors American experience in Vietnam.The Russian in charge is Bratchenko. He tells Bella that the wolverine insurgents are beasts, another irony in all those wars in which Americans are the occupiers and regard insurgents as terrorist beasts.Furthermore, Bratchenko's preferred tactic is like that of Americans, yet another irony. Occupiers are occupiers, regardless of nationality. He tells Bella You must kill every one of them, eventually. It's the same as Afghanistan. That's yet another unanticipated irony with the Americans now having replaced Russia in Afghanistan. And he adds They'll never stop, an apt comment for what the U.S. is experiencing now in Afghanistan.Bella answers Look, I was always on the side of the insurgents. I have no experience in these matters, but it would seem necessary to win the support of the people. As our opponents used to say in Vietnam, 'win their hearts and minds' Bratchenko replies And they lost, Ernesto. In this movie, the Russians and Cubans eventually lose and the Americans regain their country. There is a lesson in that. It's neither a right-wing nor a left-wing message. It's a message that such wars are very costly and can't be won. Peace is better.Bratchenko reassures Bella that morale is crucial and tells him to keep the men in secure areas and that the men will forget about the Wolverines. At that instant, a Wolverine who has infiltrated sets off a huge explosion. The shoe is on the other foot as this incident ironically foreshadows explosions in Iraq and Afghanistan, 20 years before they occurred. It foreshadows Taliban infiltration into Afghan security forces trained by the U.S.The movie has a number of faults. It lacks character development and it tends to lose its way amid the many Wolverine action attacks. The ending is more like a western or a dirty dozen than a war movie. But character actors like Harry Dean Stanton, William Smith and Ben Johnson pick it up. Ron O'Neal is outstanding. The flow of the ironies in the story carries it along, overcoming editing and other loose ends.

BEVERLY HILLS COP is one of the better cop movies to come from the 80s, which was a time where many cop films were being released. Plenty of credit needs to be passed around when it comes to the film being a success but the majority of the pie has to go to Murphy who delivers a fast, very funny and very much original performance. You can't help but watch a film like this today and really wish that the actor was still doing the same type of stuff because his comic timing is pure genius here and there are just so many examples where his charm just overwhelms the viewer. Murphy is pitch perfect playing the smart aleck cop who is constantly playing by his own rules no matter what's at stake. The early scenes in Detroit where we see the operation going wrong are flawless as is the sequence where he tells his boss off. Things certainly don't slow down when we hit Beverly Hills because Murphy's given a terrific cast to work with including Lisa Eilbacher, John Ashton and Judge Reinhold among many others. The entire cast works terrifically well together and the chemistry they share constantly jumps off the screen. Again, a lot of cop movies featured fighting with one another but the perfection here is what makes this one of the most memorable. The action scenes are all incredibly good as they contain a nice mix of drama and fun. Another major plus is the now classic music score and songs, which were a staple of 80s cinema and they remain fun today. Martin Brest did a very good job at mixing everything up and making sure that the film never slowed down or got off track.

Plenty of credit needs to be passed around when it comes to the film being a success but the majority of the pie has to go to Murphy who delivers a fast, very funny and very much original performance. You can't help but watch a film like this today and really wish that the actor was still doing the same type of stuff because his comic timing is pure genius here and there are just so many examples where his charm just overwhelms the viewer. Murphy is pitch perfect playing the smart aleck cop who is constantly playing by his own rules no matter what's at stake. The early scenes in Detroit where we see the operation going wrong are flawless as is the sequence where he tells his boss off. Things certainly don't slow down when we hit Beverly Hills because Murphy's given a terrific cast to work with including Lisa Eilbacher, John Ashton and Judge Reinhold among many others. The entire cast works terrifically well together and the chemistry they share constantly jumps off the screen. Again, a lot of cop movies featured fighting with one another but the perfection here is what makes this one of the most memorable. The action scenes are all incredibly good as they contain a nice mix of drama and fun. Another major plus is the now classic music score and songs, which were a staple of 80s cinema and they remain fun today. Martin Brest did a very good job at mixing everything up and making sure that the film never slowed down or got off track. BEVERLY HILLS COP has a lot going for it but Murphy remains the main reason to watch it.

Cinderella has taught that if you keep on believing, your dreams will come true. Sadly, I've stopped believing and started to work on my dreams. It's a great movie, but the message is wearing off now a days.Let's talk about the main question... Cinderella gets to go into this exciting ball that was hosted by prince charming. Charming caught his eye one the girl in the sliver-blue dress and fell in love instantly. Sorry Charming, it doesn't work that way. And Cinderella fell in love too. The prince is braindead. He has no personality! He just has charm! He barley knew about the girl and he wants to marry her, but then he has every girl try on the glass slipper to find who is the girl charming danced with. Like are you kidding me! He's so braindead what if a 50 year old woman fits into the glass slipper?? Charming is definitely going to regret that dance with Cinderella!Now I'm going to stop blabbing about how ignorant Prince Charming is and move on to the Tremaine family. So, Cinderella's real mom died, her father married Lady Tremaine. This new family is actually courteous and kind to Cinderella and her father. Well that changes years later. 4 ladies with a black cat and adorable mice. So Lady Tremaine and her daughter showed their true colors to poor Cinderella and they start to treat her like crap! What an exciting story so far! Why would a mother (well stepmother) treat someone in the family like crap? Doesn's she know it's child abuse? It's just so cruel of her! Cinderella just believes in her dream of falling in love with a bland prince and living happily ever after, but no. Family comes first! Cinderella is a movie about family disputes and how a family should not be! I wonder how the Tremaines will survive in the 21st century with all of these abuse prevention laws and the loads of security. But it's just family drama and Cindy is left behind.Sorry for my long, torturous paragraphs. I didn't realize it would take me this long to make my points. Otherwise Cinderella is a wonderful classic with the songs, drawings of the characters and the animals. I'm glad that I grew up with it.

No, not at all, it has problems for sure, but really it could only ever appeal to one corner of the film loving market.Dragonfly is a meditation on grief, where structured as it is, it opens the possibility of something past death offering advice and hope. This of course brings in much sentimentality as the makers hit the viewer with a sledgehammer, reference gravely ill children, young suicides and Costner's grieving. But what's wrong with sentimentality anyway? True, they go too far in the final quarter here where an underwater sequence is as trite as it gets, but some folk want to be manipulated into a teary eyed state, or they want to believe as Fox Mulder does. It's also worth mentioning that this isn't loaded as statement to say there is something after death, that the white light thing waits for us all, because it is disputed during a dinner conversation that puts up a valid argument against the near death experience.Always interesting in themes and played deftly by Costner (who always does great brooding and inner turmoil) and Bates, this is a film worthy of inspection by seekers of the heart tug. Suffice to say, the horror faithful and those that hate the treacle treatment should stay away. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 September 2012","score":"","review":" Dragonfly is directed by Tom Shadyac who also co-writes the screenplay with Brandon Camp and Mike Thompson.

They are not necessarily connected, other than through the Harvey Keitel character. And remember, this is a 1995 movie, so please don't expect an Alejandro González Iñárritu type of movie, with a frame narrative in it.

To start this review I must first say I have recently read the third edition of Frankenstein for my English Literature course and can honestly say it was one of the greatest books I have ever read. I was well accustomed with what I believed the story to be from how it is often portrayed in various media, but was completely mesmerised by the story, having so many underlying messages and themes, a story that takes us all across the world which gives this novel the worthy status as the pinnacle of the Romantic and Gothic Genre. In the 1930's we got Boris Karloff's iconic portrayal of the monster, a landmark of film, but it certainly did not translate Shelleys wonderful book well to the screen. In fact for nearly 70 years there has never been a Frankenstein adaptation that has ever been faithful to the original book. And so some goon in Hollywood decided Kenneth Branagh would be the go-to guy for the book adaptation. It is actually surprising how someone with such talent (said with a sore heart)could mess up this badly is truly more shocking and horrifying than any event in this film.It starts off like the book; Walton's ship is trapped in the arctic, where him and the crew see the monster far off and meet the eponymous Frankenstein (Branagh). The characterisation of Walton was just plain awful, not being the romantic adventurer desperate for human companionship from the novel. This character in the book was interesting as it is he whose letters frame the whole novel, it is him who learns Frankenstein's lesson at the end, and it his personality that mirrors Frankenstein's and The Monsters ideologies; Frankenstein's quest for knowledge and exploration and The Monsters need for a companion. But in this adaptation he is barely there, and when he is he is poorly played, acted more like a pompous and arrogant captain than a man striving to explore. And where is the relationship between Frankenstein and Walton? No, Branagh believes that it be better that the captain is aggressive to him, so he can just fall straight into his convulsing story. We are then introduced to the love story between Victor and Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter). I do really like Helena Bonham Carter in other films (Particularly in Sweeney Todd) but here it is like watching a completely different actress, as she theatrically throws herself with no meaning or skill from scene to scene. As the pivot to the events in the book, we have Frankenstein's mother die, but in a completely different way to in the book, so we get a gory shot of a dodgy birth. They have also from this film adaptation got rid of Victors younger brother Ernest, changed it so it is Victors professor who has the idea of bringing dead matter back to life, Making Victor meet Henry at university... Eventually all this artistic licensing and changing of the mythology has made this film completely different from the original novel and alienating any true fan of the book. For example, the death of Judith isn't as severe as in the book it is the law that kills her, whilst here it is a lynch mob. It is as if Branagh ran out of running time in the second half so tried to quickly summarise the rest of the book. But in doing this, has stopped it being even remotely Gothic. Where is the vast scenery, where is the slow picking off of the various characters... It is a rushed and bloated mess.The one possible saving grace for this film is Robert De Niro, who does actually create a believable and quite emotional monster. But he is so rushed and thoughtlessly thrown through the action that the audience finds it hard to connect with this innocent gone bad. The rest of the acting in this film is wooden and unbelievable, so the characters that are so well rounded in the book are taken back a step. The penultimate change to Elizabeth's death, making her resurrected in one last experiment by Frankenstein, is just ridiculous and at that point was the last straw to this abhorred film. The ending attempts to be bittersweet, but fails to see the ambiguity that Shelleys novel was regaled with. I did not care when any of the characters, even Victor, died, and I doubt anyone else could.Branagh, a lot like Victor himself, has taken bits of beauty from the book, built and constructed it into this monster and as soon as Branaghs monster has opened its eyes we are revealed to how hideous and monstrous it truly is.

They have also from this film adaptation got rid of Victors younger brother Ernest, changed it so it is Victors professor who has the idea of bringing dead matter back to life, Making Victor meet Henry at university... Eventually all this artistic licensing and changing of the mythology has made this film completely different from the original novel and alienating any true fan of the book. For example, the death of Judith isn't as severe as in the book it is the law that kills her, whilst here it is a lynch mob. It is as if Branagh ran out of running time in the second half so tried to quickly summarise the rest of the book. But in doing this, has stopped it being even remotely Gothic. Where is the vast scenery, where is the slow picking off of the various characters... It is a rushed and bloated mess.The one possible saving grace for this film is Robert De Niro, who does actually create a believable and quite emotional monster. But he is so rushed and thoughtlessly thrown through the action that the audience finds it hard to connect with this innocent gone bad. The rest of the acting in this film is wooden and unbelievable, so the characters that are so well rounded in the book are taken back a step. The penultimate change to Elizabeth's death, making her resurrected in one last experiment by Frankenstein, is just ridiculous and at that point was the last straw to this abhorred film. The ending attempts to be bittersweet, but fails to see the ambiguity that Shelleys novel was regaled with. I did not care when any of the characters, even Victor, died, and I doubt anyone else could.Branagh, a lot like Victor himself, has taken bits of beauty from the book, built and constructed it into this monster and as soon as Branaghs monster has opened its eyes we are revealed to how hideous and monstrous it truly is. You want classic Gothic, read the book, and stay away from this film.

I watched this movie for the second time today. I generally don't prefer to watch a movie second time as I prefer to watch something new instead of something I have already seen. But today, somehow, I didn't have any new movie available to watch and I thought of going through my library of close to 1000 movies just to have a glimpse of what all I have got. I desperately wanted to watch a movie since I was getting bored and I picked my 12 angry Men from my library. I was casual in the beginning since I had already watched it before, but oh boy, I was so much captivated while watching this movie second time too. The story and the characters are so likable.Kudos to Henry Fonda and the team to come up with such a masterpiece. I wish more meaningful movies with as low a budget as this one could be made in today's time too. 10 out of 10 for this movie !!

But its predecessor, the 1932 Hawks movie, its a lot better. First, Muni is a lot more credible like a half stupid and half brute criminal, who fight in the world where all is possible in the only way that his brain can handle. In Muni character violence is essential and a particular language to deal with a world open for anyone that can handle it. Muni, at the opposite side of Pacino, is very human, human to act and human to die, and he die as his boss die under his hands, how any criminal, in a good tale about moral and the right way to do things define, must to die praying for his life, defenseless against a society that is a lot more than him. Its not a minor point, in fact its a huge point, the radical difference between Muni shoot dead for policemen without excess and Pacino fighting some kind the little war against numberless henchmen send by a drug Bolivian landlord. A lot more credible is also the Muni sister reaction, who at last just must to recognize the undeniable fact that both are the same because are in the same side of the world, than the Pacino sister with all that twisted incestuous allusion, besides the incredible bad skill with the gun. If you liked this over-sized remake you must to watch the original one...

And that's probably a good thing in this case.As you have probably noticed, it's very hard to describe this movie. It has very little dialogue. It's unlike any movie you have ever seen. So let me start off by saying that I'm in my late teens and I find it hard to sit in one place for two and a half hours. And I've managed to sit trough this whole movie. The visual side of this movie is perfect. The imagery, the colors, the scenes. Not to mention that it probably took forever to make it. I cannot believe that someone made this forty years ago. I'm not going to rate this movie because your satisfaction depends on what you expect from it. Think of it as a piece of classical music. It's complex, sophisticated and technically perfect. If you're in the right mood, you will enjoy it greatly. If you're not, a simple yet straightforward three-chord song will elicit more emotion than the aforementioned piece ever would. In any case, it's the work of a genius and you should see it just because it is a milestone in film making.I strongly recommend getting stoned before watching this movie. Actually, wait, that's a terrible idea.
