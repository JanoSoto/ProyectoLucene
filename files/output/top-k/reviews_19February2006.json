Charlie is now the loose canon Gordon was at his age and along with his poor attitude towards his new coach Charlie starts to go downhill fast. Emilio is a gun in this movie and he is my favorite character and Coach Orion (Jeffrey Nordling) is my second favorite and they both put in stellar performances. The great speech about Defence by Coach Orion is a classic quote and is very true even in my sport Soccer and life. It's one of my favorite quotes of all time from any movie. The Minnesota Miracle Man scene is a highlight and Emilio is just class. The music choreography in D3 is excellent. It was so well done and example is when the Varsity team starts picking up the hitting and the music behind the scene starts saying Beat em in a opera like voice. The music complements the situation well throughout the whole movie and is one of its major pluses.D3 definitely has it's dull parts and some poor acting at times but at other times the acting is pretty good.

Great movies make you feel something while you are inside the theater, but great films go home with you and consume your soul for months and years to come. Great films are also well written, offer thorough character development, well-acted, smartly shot, and treat their audiences in an intelligent manner. There is nothing worse than seeing a movie and \/ or film which insults the audience's intelligence.Now, let's make this simple -(Mulholland Drive simple? yeah right....)Here's what I love about the film Naomi Watts is both effortless and flawless in her delivery - what an actress.....; Robert Forster's role (Detective McKnight)- albeit limited, was so very well-timed and properly placed within the film; Lynch's spicy color schemes are as simultaneously vibrant, disturbing, stunning, bizarre, uneasy and awkward which is a direct reflection of his characters. And the soundtrack? - oh me oh my..... the soundtrack.....it's as chilling and dark as my hallway at 300 am.Laura Harring is a rare and precious gem constantly reminding us of the great Rita Hayworth and her all-encompassing and extraordinary embodiment of beauty; Justin Theroux accomplishes so much in his role that I wouldn't know where to begin; and just the idea of casting Ann Miller (Louise Bonner) for her role as Coco brings those words Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer back to life for the audience - as well as a longing for a resurgence of the great movie musical.I fall in love with L.A. (especially L.A. at night) all over again every time I view this film. When I think of L.A. I think of all the people and things I have lost in my life. But I also think about what could possibly happen 5 minutes from now and how my life could change entirely. Then I begin to look around and think of all that garbage and evil such as despair, loneliness, cruelty, greed, lust, crime and poverty. But, maybe this sick cycle simply feeds my love for L.A. There is a haunting beauty that is associated with all of these elements; perhaps it is the idea that although we are constantly reminded of the evil in the world, there is always hope - hope that, one day, things will right themselves, and for each of us - our dreams of the perfect life and the perfect world will be realized.David Lynch has always been a favorite of mine as far as Directors go, and Mulholland Drive is just another disturbing, but ravishing piece of work generated from the mind of this genius. Mulholland Drive is an extremely abstract film that is wide-open for individual interpretation - and, for myself and for fans of this film, that truly is the fun part. If you choose to show this film to friends or family, choose your audience wisely. Invite your film lovers to your next showing, but lock the door if the movie-lovers want to join-in. Still, no matter who your audience is, expect some frustration, tons of questions, and confusion beyond belief. But, most of all, while Mulholland Drive is showing, expect a great deal of silence (silencio).Thanks for reading - and enjoy!

It hits the right note on four levels visual, aural, intellectual, and emotional. The special effects hold up as some of the most disturbing that have ever been filmed. They aren't quite perfect, but given the subject matter you will have a tough time thinking of how they could have been done better in 1982 (or now, in today's impressive but hokey looking CGI). The sound of the Thing when it screams in pain is otherworldly and memorable. The movie gets you to think about how you would react in this situation, about the ramifications of such a creature existing, and about what actually happened since so many burning questions were left unanswered. It also hits the all-time height of paranoia, where your best friend could have been taken over by an alien with no regard for your or anyone else's life, and has the ability to kill you and take you over with a simple and easy touch. And the only way you will know whether the guy next to you is the thing is by harming it, and therefore, releasing it where it will destroy what it can in self defense. The only way to kill it is to burn it. You can't wound it because it can quickly repair itself by reforming itself. You can't freeze it. It survived 100,000 years of being frozen in the ice of Antarctica. You can't dismember it, since every cell is a being unto itself, capable of killing and imitating its victims.If you are into horror and sci-fi, this movie will impress you and keep you guessing, thinking, and hypothesizing. Whether you are squeamish or hard-stomached this one will stick in your memory. If you like happy endings, this will upset you. Regardless, it will leave you wondering what happened both during the movie and after its conclusion.

The movie gets you to think about how you would react in this situation, about the ramifications of such a creature existing, and about what actually happened since so many burning questions were left unanswered. It also hits the all-time height of paranoia, where your best friend could have been taken over by an alien with no regard for your or anyone else's life, and has the ability to kill you and take you over with a simple and easy touch.

The closest the movie comes to figuring out Bobby is when Catherine van Oost (played, again brilliantly, by Susan Anspach) dices and slices him into many more than five tiny little pieces. Why should I go with you? she asks him. If a person has no love for himself, no respect for himself, no love of his friends, family, work, something--how can he ask for love in return? I mean, why should he ask for it? Bobby is left muttering something like Well, ah . . . I could make you happy. But he realizes she's right.

The extremely difficult traffic sequences--even the ones on the ferry boats--flow seamlessly. And the road movie section from L.A. to Vancouver with Helena Kallianiotis as the utterly bizarre, hygiene-obsessed lesbian is a masterpiece. In every location, Rafelson has everything under control, yet he allowed actors a wide berth to expand the rather abstract characters assigned them.

The movie shows the Holocaust in the most powerful and confronting way possible. It doesn't hold back with its images or story. In that regard Schindler's List is a daring movie but the end result is more powerful than you could have ever imagined. The movie tells the true story of Nazi-party member Oskar Schindler, who as the war progresses sees more and more horrors of the Holacaust and decides to help the Jews in the best way possible for him.Schindler's List is honestly one of the movie powerful movies ever created. Since almost everything in the movie is based on true events it makes it all even more powerful. It's hard to imaging that these horrible things all actually truly occurred. The movie is filled with graphic, confronting and humiliating images. It provides the movie with some unforgettable sequences that will leave a lasting impression on you. Never has the Holocaust been brought to the silver screen in such a detailed and confronting way. Not everyone will be able to handle watching Schindler's List. It really is not a movie for the faint of heart.Spielberg delivers with this movie his most important and perhaps also most personal and best movie. The storytelling of the movie is perfect and the way it focuses on the many characters of the movie is spot-on. It follows many different Jewish characters who all had their different experiences.Yes, the movie does become over-sentimental at times, especially toward the ending but in this case I forgive Spielberg. It in no way makes the movie any less powerful or meaningful. The message of the movie comes trough very hard and direct. Everyone should watch this movie, not only because it's such a good one but especially because it's a very important one.The movie is filmed in black & white. I think main reason for this was to make the movie look less graphic, since the main essence of the movie should not be on the graphic images but on the confronting and realistic emotions of history. It's not a movie that tries to shock, it's a movie that confronts in a very direct way instead. Whatever the real true reason was for making the movie in black & white, it works really well for the movie its time period and atmosphere. The lighting of director of photography Janusz Kaminski is really phenomenal at times. Also the dramatic musical score by John Williams is impressive and makes some of the sequences work even extra powerful.Also the acting is great in this movie. The Jewish persons are mostly played by unknown and unexperienced actors. It makes them. in their roles, extra credible and believable. We see them as persons, not as actors playing persons. That's also another reason why the movie works powerful, the characters are all very real. Not only the Jews but also the Nazi-Germans. The movie launched the careers of both Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes. Liam Neeson is great as the main lead and Ralph Fiennes is truly chilling as the camp commander Amon Goeth. Another fine impressive role is being played by Ben Kingsley.Among the best movies of the 20th century but more important, it's a very important movie that reminds us of what happened- and should never happen again.10\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"19 February 2006","score":"4 out of 12 people found the following review useful","review":" Schindler's List is a powerful movie that is a reminder to the world of where hatred can lead to.

The ethereal existence of an angel is nothing compared to real life which consists of reading the newspapers, caressing a woman's neck, eating a good meal, painting a picture or having a beer or a cup of coffee in a pub full of lowlifes.

It's simply not funny any more. Yes, we don't have naughty teens or pie jokes, but we have ugly girls who are members of something like a sect and 3 idiots who as I remember were virgin and got at the sec instead of another place, they wanted to be at. Nothing special and I have to say I didn't laugh at it and some jokes were just stupid and the balance between romance and comedy is broken and the movie is a mess between these 2 genres. Of course I like some scenes. They were entertaining and considering the fact that more and more comedies try to be like American Pie, I cannot bash that one like it is the only one. Overacting, bad soundtrack which is a bad factor, because acting doesn't matter in movies like this, but soundtrack does. At least these are my impressions and I think soundtrack takes a big part of American Pie's huge success in building a whole new genre.Needless movie, but if you are in really good mood and you have free time to lose, rent it.

The reason I watched this film for the first time years ago was the fact that I had played Dune 2 The Building of a Dynasty. I had never read the book or even heard of it until I saw the film (and no, I still haven't read the book and probably never will, I don't like reading). Years after watching the film for the first time I also played the original Dune game, which was great, as well.Dune has a perfect set of actors; to mention some of my favorites Kyle MacLachlan, Everett McGill (funny, they both were cast in another David Lynch masterpiece, Twin Peaks) and Jürgen Prochnow (I prefer him without a mustache & beard though, lol!). I can't help mentioning Sting as well, even though I prefer him as an artist.Another thing I loved about this film was the stunningly beautiful music. Especially I liked the piece that was played during the end credits.The movie itself had a good plot (I must remind you I haven't read the book so I don't know whether the movie was anything even close to the book??). It was fun to watch, there were no boring moments. I was a bit confused in the beginning of the film though, the Emperor had a strange guest, I can't remember what the thing was called or what its purpose was... if you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about (the pink creature...??).Anyway, I REALLY recommend this film to everyone, it's really a pleasure to watch!

It's honestly not THAT terrible.I gotta say, when I was pretty young and saw it, it was quite a shock to see lush green plains replaced with a degenerate city unrivaled by even the worst areas of New York, and to see a slimy weird lizard where the happy-go-lucky Yoshi we all know and love would be, not to mention tiny walking mushrooms with mean faces replaced with some of the freakiest looking gargantuan humanoid monsters I've ever seen. Obviously, the movie has very little in common with the games in terms of appearance. However, the concept basically remains the same. Mario and Luigi set out to rescue the princess from Bowser\/Koopa (who is also nothing like the giant monster he was in the games).When I was young, my surprise overshadowed my understanding of the movie. Now that I'm older and have seen it again, I can better appreciate some of the good ideas it offered, and put aside comparisons with the games.The story of origin is very interesting. I found the whole idea of dimensions split into a world of people evolved from apes and a world of people evolved from dinosaurs to be quite unique. Also, I liked the ideas of the evolution machine and the ubiquitous living fungus. Of course, for good ideas in movies to work, they must be delivered well. In a lot of ways, Super Mario Bros does not succeed in this.The acting is actually pretty poor. Bob Hoskins and Dennis Hopper do an OK job, but John Leguiazamo and Samantha Mathis not so much. The bumbling Iggy and Spike deliver their lines much in the same way that people in high school plays do. You can't really take the actions of the actors very seriously, even at times when one is supposed to. The love subplot between Luigi and Daisy is done very poorly. If the director tried to make it seem less serious, it would have been OK, but he tries and fails to make the audience feel it is genuine. Also, some of the humour almost makes you cringe, and is pretty hackneyed. Consult the quote section for some examples.These flaws aside, I still found this movie enjoyable enough to watch all the way through. If you're afraid of wasting money on a rental, then wait for it to come on TV.

Roger Rabbit himself was a VERY annoying character--I could care less what happened to him. The storyline was vague and more than a little confusing--it kept coming to a screeching halt countless times when a toon made a cameo. No characterizations either--the cartoons are more 3-dimensional than the humans! The script also thinks it's more clever than it actually is.I didn't like this much when it came out in 1988--it was a MONSTER hit. My feelings haven't changed much.
