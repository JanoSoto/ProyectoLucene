Leo escapes captivity and leads mankind against evil chimpanzee general Thade (Tim Roth) and his army.The moment humans on the planet opened their mouths to speak I knew this was doomed to fail. Not that a remake should fanatically mimic everything about the original (for example, Van Sant made a carbon copy of Psycho and the result was absurd) I'd argue some departures are necessary, otherwise why bother? But there are changes and changes. Humans being mute and beast-like was the WHOLE POINT OF THE STORY. In this remake, these people behave like normal human beings - it's as if a kid saw the original and grasped just the basic premise of a planet with talking apes, with the meditation on humanity and religious fanaticism whooshing over his head.Roth is an actor who can play effectively both nice (see The Legend of 1900) and despicable individuals; here, he is in full villain mode. Helena Bonham-Carter also has fun as Ari. Wahlberg is bland as the insipid Leo; much like Brad Pitt, Wahlberg is a fine character actor whose talent appears to melt whenever he plays a conventional lead. Other cast members don't have much to do, their performances overshadowed by their costumes (and, in case of former swimmer Estella Warren, by her lack thereof). Make-up by Rick Backer is exceptional, the only real achievement of the movie.The ending is terrible. First, a simian deus-ex-machina (now that's a satisfying climax!). And then, a final twist which does not and will never make *any* sense. Unless, of course, you buy the fact Thade could a) escape from his prison b) find Leo's pod in the swamp; c) repair it; d) travel through galaxy and find Earth ; e) also travel back in time f) single-handedly lead monkeys to defeat mankind. Um, OK. You're kidding, right, Tim Burton?What a sad, desperate attempt to find something as shocking as the epilogue of the original - now *that* was a brilliant twist.

He assumes it's from a writer he turned down, confronts him, and a heated argument leads to the writer's death. Now Griffin's a murder suspect, and guess what - he picked the wrong guy ...The Player is a fantastic dark thriller which works extremely well, both as a character study of a unlikely killer, and as an expos√© on Hollywood's practices - story pitches, schmoozing rich investors, audience preview testing and the like. The great thing about Michael Tolkin's script (he plays one of the two goofy brothers trying to cut a deal) is whether or not you relate to Griffin. Do you think he's a scumbag who deserves to get caught, because that is what he is. Or do you find yourself worrying for him, as the tension racks up on all sides, despite the fact that he's a jerk and we know he's guilty. Robbins doesn't make him sympathetic but he does make him intelligent and cultured, so there's always a duality to the character. The sad legacy of this movie of course is that when it came out only an asshole would wear Raybans, drive a Range Rover and talk on a cell-phone all the time, whereas nowadays that's what everyone aspires to. Griffin not only winds up tops in the movie, but everybody wants to be like him. The rest of the cast are varied - Scacchi is boring and Goldberg is ludicrously over the top (playing the one character who's supposed to be realistic), but Stevenson, Ward and D'Onofrio are great. The movie's trump card of course is its astonishing extras cast of sixty-five actors playing themselves (which beats even the forty-three in Around The World In Eighty Days), ranging from huge stars (Julia Roberts, Bruce Willis) to old codgers (Jack Lemmon, Rod Steiger) to cult icons (Malcolm McDowell, Louise Fletcher), presumably all pals of the much-admired Altman. This serves to make it seem both real and fantasy at the time, which is a tone the movie nails spot-on and gels with the happy-but-awful ending it satirises so well. There's also a weird, brilliant score by the prolific Thomas Newman, all bells, percussion and double-bass. I was a bit amazed when Altman made this, since it's a world away from his usual insightful but interminably plodding multi-character dramas, and technically it's superb - it even has a stunning eight-minute opening shot which approaches the work of peerless craftsmen like Brian DePalma or Quentin Tarantino. This movie was funded independently by TV mogul Aaron Spelling, since obviously no major studio would touch it, and was intriguingly snubbed at the Oscars, despite doing good box-office and winning lots of other prestigious awards. I guess Hollywood didn't like what it had to say, which is reason enough to see it.

Hogan) Promising comedy turns into predictable mess ¬Ω way thru the movie. Julia Roberts as Julian stars as a woman trying to break up the wedding of her former best friend, played by Dermot Mulroney, because she's decided that she's the best person for him. She gets help, encouragement and advice from her gay friend, played excellently by Rupert Everett, providing some of the best moments in the movie. Julia is initially irresistible as always and the first half of the movie is very funny, but all of the sudden the movie turns introspective and loses it's comedic flair and Julian starts making stupid decisions where we can't really tell what's going on with her. We start questioning whether she really wants Mulroney's character or not. She plays the movie out like she does want him, but writing a fake email from his boss that would ruin his relationship and put her in jail is the last straw. It's then sent accidentally and all hell breaks loose, as far as the movie's concerned. From this point on(actually a little earlier), we don't know who to route for and we no longer care. The problem is that the movie goes on and on after this point even to the point of trying to make us all happy by providing a funny moment at the end with her gay friend. This is one of those movies where you feel manipulated as the audience has to go thru all the ridiculous scenarios to get to the ending that you've lost interest in anyway. Too bad, because the movie definitely had potential but even Julia's charm couldn't rescue this one from mediocrity.
