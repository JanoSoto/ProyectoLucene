Maybe, in the opinion of some, the 3 Lord of The Rings films will be better...anything can happen, and it is all a matter of opinion.This here is the third and last movie in the series, I consider most successful(the series, not this film). A variety of great actors, great ideas and one great director made such a feast possible. When I hear the Godfather I can not think of only one movie...the Godfather means Francis Ford Coppola. It means Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Diane Keaton, and most of all, it means Marlon Brando. You might well enough conclude, that I liked the first movie in the series most, as it probably is considered the best by most viewers. But this review is about the third part of the trilogy.The whole movie is similarly structured as the first two. It really reminded me of the first part though, maybe a little too much. Probably, the, let's say, lack of success of this movie is also based on that. Most of the ideas that appear in the first movie, and in the second, can also be seen here. The family has it's part, business it's part and love it's part.Michael Corleone is the character we will follow through out this movie. I consider that some changes have taken place in time, and that Michael, as time passed by, desires to get rid of the life he actually never wanted, but then embraced. After his, what I consider, degeneration as a human being in the second movie, he tries to redeem himself in this one. Yet, we get to see a world that is shattered by the hatred of men, and consequently by evil. Many morals are being ignored in this world forbidden love and terrible crimes take place. The meaning of family is actually being played with, by the two lovers who  ignore the fact that they are relatives. People can never be trusted in this world, and revenge is always bitter sweet...is it really our world? Well, not our whole world, but still part of it.There are the scenes that are similar in the first and this movie the films start with a party, ends as both the others, trusted people betray, nobody is safe, Michael(like his father) gets to the hospital and a new don appears. This don is none other, but Sonny's son, who, probably for the worst, is very alike his father...the short temper. Also he gets attached to Michael, and protects him when he is unable to protect himself, and he does have a strong will. Vincent, that is his name, falls in love though with Mary, his cousin and also Michaels daughter...Michael does not agree with this combination, and he succeeds to unbind them too, using the lust for power that Vincent feels. Sadly, few real stories have happy endings, and this one couldn't be one of these. The fact that we get to also see Michael die at the end underlines the idea that everyone has his turn...no one escapes.The involvement of the church in this story is a little incredible...the fact that such things can happen at the Vatican is slightly disturbed. can people really do such terrible things? I hope not...still, what can you expect from those who have no other reason to live, but money? The Archbishop is an evil character...I considered him so from the beginning...I think the fact that he smoked was a sign. Still, I could not imagine that anyone would be so ill minded to kill the pope. Frightening story...Kay and Michael rejoin through their children...partly at least, the relations between them get better. This was to be expected, as Michael's was was to be redeemed, and he was practically preparing himself for the end of his life. Some might think this is normal, that many people suddenly turn to God and start to regret, the wrong things they have done, at an old age. I'd tell them just to think of the 80 years old Altobello. He, the one who calls himself peace maker is actually the one who causes the death of a beautiful young lady...peace is rarely achieved through murders, and if it is, then I really would not trust such a cease-fire.  Cardinal Lomberto is honest and good hearted...all that is good in that world of evil...well, maybe together with Anthony. But Lomberto is also going to show that goodness does not prevail in our world...honesty is not welcome in some places, and some personal interests are more important than the interest of the human race.I really enjoyed this film, more than other movies with higher marks...I stick to my idea, that if this had been a stand-alone movie it would've been more successful. Peace is hard to find on earth...and when you decide to do something you better think twice. Sometimes, you can not turn around.The actors are good...yet, I really felt the missing of a Marlon Brando. I fear Al Pacion isn't enough...that might be why I considered the second Godfather part a small disappointment...but that's another story. Andy Garcia plays the role of Vincent smoothly, and he has also got the aspect I would think of for such a character. He is a useful addition, that did give this film a little more taste. I did miss though some of the great actors that appeared in the first two movies. I guess, as I said, Pacino wasn't enough for me...and Garcia could not complement for a Brando, or even for a De Niro. This movie is generally good and if there hadn't been the two things I mentioned earlier it would've been great. But in this case, an 8\/10 are enough for the performance seen. Still think it's worthy for an applause.

That anyone can work his way up to fame and fortune. But what happens when you have all the money you might need? People degenerate. Kane is the kind of character who degenerated. It is always about himself. He is the one who rules, he is the one who commands. He wanted a newspaper, so everyone could hear him...but no one could really know him. After the dies, the press asks itself what his last word might have meant. Rosebud. A reporter, named Thompson, is assigned to find out its significance...as if they could understand him after finding out that the sense of that one word.I believe it really does mean something he has lost. All his life, Kane suffered...without really knowing. All the ones around him, really were there to love him, because he needed someone to be able to go on. Like in Casablanca... His false idea was that he could get anyone with money and presents. He had to be in the center of all things. For him, he was all that really mattered.Kane was a disputed figure, someone who never quite knew what was right. Someone who thought that because he was rich, he could do anything he wanted with the ones around him. He kept his respect though for the whole American population, and he wished that they found out the truth about what was happening around them. You might say, he did accomplish his goal...but his methods, and his whole life, were messed up. His second way, poor miss Alexander, was forced to live a life she could not. A life without love, a life without real essence. She had the role to love Kane, without being loved. No friends, no nothing...all she liked were some jigsaw puzzles, and that was all she had to live with. Kane's friend, Jed, is just another person in his company...his friendship with Kane, is not of real essence, so it ends at a given point. Was it because the article? Or was it because he was drunk? I am not sure...maybe both. Maybe only the first. One more thing would be, that Kane always needs to do something with a reason...all he does, he does with a reason. How many people act so now? Can you act in such a way? Only with reason? Might be. But to always need to prove something, that is a thing that few people do. It shows how strong a man's will actually is. Kane is a figure which gets lost in this world. His needs are to high to be fulfilled. Citizen Kane tries to make himself loved, through his abilities, through his humor, or through his way of thinking. Yet, he never gets to know the people around him...and thinks merely of himself. How can you write to people you do not really know? The thing that Kane never had, was a happy childhood and that's where man sets his limits. In this case, it all revolved around money.

I feel like I definitely got to know them.  That sad quality of Robert Forester, the melancholic mood, it's become more and more a part of my character.  The unrequited aspect of the plot, it too is something I can identify with.  And Pam's character, she's such a wonderful person anyway.  She's had her hard knocks, in real life.  Haven't we all?  But she wears it well.   To me this is a triumph of character.  Jackie triumphs over the people she must overcome, while staying true to the one person who is true to her Max Cherry.  Max is true to just about everyone, and he is the most sympathetic character in the filmI saw Reservoir Dogs when it came out, and loved it.  I laughed when a friend described it as the 'feel good movie of the year'.  I thought Pulp Fiction was, to a certain extent, a sell out, in that it took the basic ideas of Reservoir Dogs, and made them more saleable by virtue of the big names Bruce Willis and John Travolta.

It has become my new favorite film.  It has replaced the Sorrow and the Pity as the 'regular' flick in my VCR.  I think I have seen it eight times, or moreI'd say this is his best film yet.  Granted, we needed the other two films to get to the point where we are now, but his story of redemption, and tender, unrequited love, the acting, the soundtrack, the casting (except De Niro, who was underplaying to a fault) - it's a combination that I can't easily forget.  My favorite scenes are, first, when Max meets Jackie at the gate, as that song is playing.  And, second, in their last meeting, the tender kiss and the even more poignant look on Max's face as he excuses himself from his phone conversation to look out the window, with that 8 year old look on his face, I can feel his stomach getting sockedIt's a bittersweet film.  It's a calmer film.  For those who say it isn't 'Pulp Fiction', or at that level, all I can say is that I actually prefer Jackie Brown.  These characters are loveable.

I am commenting on the content of the movie how the movie handles cancer and the commentaries on the DVD.  I am sorry, but my experience with cancer might be able to shed a little light on the contents of the movie. If this spoils your viewing pleasure I apologize in advance.This is a review of A Walk to Remember. First let me express my sympathy to Mr. Sparks His sister must have been a beautiful woman to inspire such a wonderful book and movie.I was only familiar with two of the actresses in the movie Daryl Hannah and Mandy Moore. Their transformations in the movie were amazing. I am used to seeing both actresses blonde, especially Mandy Moore. I always imagined her looking like Brittney Spears, I was pleasantly surprised.Ms. Moore?s mannerisms helped bring Jamie to life. looking down at her feel, stooped shoulders, quiet voice, the lisp when she spoke, all added life to Jamie. I could almost see a bit of her in people from my high school.The topic of cancer was well handled by the movie.Many people with cancer want to keep their illness a secret from everyone. They do not want to be defined by the cancer, they want to live as well as they can for as long as they can. They want to be known by their names not their disease. So the characters keeping their illness hidden is very commen.Also, people who are dying tend to retreat from the world, and the movie got this right. For someone who is dying a chance at romance could be very scary; this represents a very strong connection to this world that many terminally ill people could not face.The father's reaction to the cancer is common in one respect and uncommon in another. First his desire to protect is common among caregivers, especially if the terminally ill is a relative. But his actions, after the relapse, is unusual.  Many caregivers justify their actions by saying ?they are keeping he\/she alive?; the idea that they could be overprotective does not occur to most.  It takes a lot of courage to think  ?maybe I have been overprotective?. The character shows even more courage by saying it.I have noticed something else about terminal illness; next to each sorrow there is grace that can affect many people.  In the movie the cancer is a catalyst for many positive changes, and this can also be true in real life.How do I know all this? In 1999 my father died of cancer after a year of struggle. The year of 2002 saw more in March one of my aunts died of cancer, in September by Grandfather died of old age and I was down-sized, in October Benjamin died. He went to school one day, had an afternoon nap, and never woke-up. He was six. And in late October, a friend of mine was diagnosed with thyroid cancer.I have two complains about the movie. First the pace of the movie is too fast. There does not seem to be enough time to develop the characters, hence the changes in the characters seem a little rushed.Secondly, the commentaries on the DVD surprised me. The one with the screen writer and the author was very interesting and informative. It was also added something to the story and was respect full of the story.  I learned a bit about what the screen writer did to make the story and I learned a bit about how the author wrote the book. Again, let me express my sympathies for your loss Mr. Sparks, I have been through something similar and it hurts.The commentary by Mandy Moore, Shane West and the director took something away from the story and was not respectful of the story. It was very cynical and it hurt ...  I know that if I was on the outside of the story, if I was an attractive and popular star,  I would make cynical jokes about the girl with the funny skirt or the big car or other stuff.  Maybe the reason the commentary hurt was because cancer and the loss described in the movie is still close to me.  Maybe is was because it was nice to see a romantic lead that worried about being good not just looking good; that an outsider could be accepted, I do not know. It just did not seem to fit with the story.I recommend the movie because it is well done, but if someone has lost someone to cancer, or has been treated like an outsider, be careful of the commentary by the stars and the director, it can sting.

A lot of it didn't make much sense without those little books yellow  books we all bought called CliffsNotes.  Once we bought the books, all of a  sudden, we were given insight and could appreciate the work as it was meant to  be appreciated, seeing all sorts of things that went over our heads when we skimmed through it the first time.  In this review I'm going to provide these notes  for you and I'll try to do it in such a way so that I'm not giving away much of the  story.  You can read this review first, and then see the movie, picking up on an  important theme, or see it first and then come back and read what I'm going to  point out in the next paragraph. Amazingly, everyone that has written a review seems to have misunderstood it to some degree.  You can find many things to enjoy about the film and still like it,  but some familiarity with christianity helps in giving the viewer insight.  What do  we know about the life of Christ?  He died for our sins, giving up his own life for  others, making the ultimate sacrifice, right?  rgiveness is a very powerful  theme in Christianity.  Watch this movie, and look at the protagonist as  someone who can, potentially, become the most unlikely Christ figure and it will  be one of the most unpredictable and ironic movies you have ever seen.  Also,  keep in mind that the bad lieutenant, towards the end of the movie, has money  that could buy him out of all of his problems.  It is also enough money to buy two  boys out of their problems as well, but can't save all three of them. We all know  what the Christ-like thing to do would be, but does the protagonist decide to do? The movie takes a lot of chances, and raises a lot of questions.  You can feel the  film taking you in directions that few have explored before.  It's very controversial, and any movie that raises so many questions about religious values is going to be very polarizing.  I have great respect and admiration for  film makers that roll the dice and take a chance when making a movie, when they could probably appeal to a wider audience by playing it safe.

He died for our sins, giving up his own life for  others, making the ultimate sacrifice, right?  rgiveness is a very powerful  theme in Christianity.  Watch this movie, and look at the protagonist as  someone who can, potentially, become the most unlikely Christ figure and it will  be one of the most unpredictable and ironic movies you have ever seen.  Also,  keep in mind that the bad lieutenant, towards the end of the movie, has money  that could buy him out of all of his problems.  It is also enough money to buy two  boys out of their problems as well, but can't save all three of them. We all know  what the Christ-like thing to do would be, but does the protagonist decide to do? The movie takes a lot of chances, and raises a lot of questions.  You can feel the  film taking you in directions that few have explored before.  It's very controversial, and any movie that raises so many questions about religious values is going to be very polarizing.  I have great respect and admiration for  film makers that roll the dice and take a chance when making a movie, when they could probably appeal to a wider audience by playing it safe.

I was very excited about this film after viewing the trailers just prior to its release, and the wait for its release to video was long in coming.

Films such as War of the Worlds, Earth vs the Flying Saucers and Close Encounters of the Third Kind were all awesome in their own right and for their time.  Although I found a lot to like, I must say I found Signs ultimately disappointing.Shyamalan has proven himself to be a moviemaker of the highest caliber having directed the brilliant Sixth Sense.  In Signs, his talent again comes through in his ability to grip the audience with rising tension.  I found myself in the movies grip, anxiously awaiting the payoff.  How was the Hess family, and Gibson's character's loss of faith going to play out?  I cared about the Hess family and their predicament.  Imagining myself in the Hess' place at the moment of seeing the alien figure on top of the roof of the neighboring building left me squirming in my seat.  The movies pacing is fine, the acting adaquete, but the climax left me feeling I had been cheated.Perhaps it is my love of hard core sci-fi that was the root cause of my opinion that this movie failed in the end.  The aliens were just too easy to defeat.  How is it that a race of beings with the technology to cross the void of space could so easily be tossed aside by just sprinkling a little H2O on them?  How would any self respecting alien super race have individuals that cannot find a way to get out of a closet, or break through a basement door?  Give me a break.The problem with this movie, and so many more Hollywood sci-fi flicks is that the writer or writers just lack the imagination and the general knowledge of science to really blow true sci-fi afficionados away.  It is in that regard that a movie like the Matrix was so brilliant.  Someone with some real imagination sat down and penned a screenplay that truly stretched the imagination of filmgoers and hard core sci-fi buffs in that one.

Great flick! Later I discovered that Billy Bob Thornton was one of the writers (or something?)--- and was pleasantly surprised. He was a good actor, and he showed great promise as a movie maker (check out Sling Blade Primary Colors, and even his bit part in the horrible Armageddon). But then his decent into Hollywood Party-fluff and Celeb Pose-O-Rama in the tabloids for a few years sort of took him off the map, serious artist-wise. And his dalliance with 2-dimensional Angela Jolie, and all the other tedious Celeb Bulls*** lifestyle stuff had made me wonder if his talent was gone. Had he become yet another used to be that burned out and now only appears on TV in lame-o crap such as Hollywood Squares or at celeb charity ego-fests? NO! The Gift would indicate that Billy Bob is back with us, and that is a good thing.The Gift is a suspense drama, or something. Kind of a thriller, but the events are less important than the characters' relationship to the events. I suppose not knowing the ending in advance would give a degree of excitement--- but one could see this movie a second time and still enjoy the performances.The supernatural touch was just right--- hundreds of thousands, or perhaps millions, of people have just such visions at some time, usually unbidden. What struck me as accurate in this movie was the emphasis on how such visions are indeed no different than regular sights. One begins to understand that having a vision is no different than looking out a window--- you see stuff. The meaning you derive from what you see is purely subjective, however. Who you fundamentally are is still the backdrop against which you then undertake understandings or behaviors, whether you are seeing physical objects or meta-physical objects. The movie subtly brings this out as well. Cate's visions don't propel the plot, nor are they critical to the movie itself--- it is her relationship to the visions that is the movie's core. This relationship is also the kind of thing that many, many people contend with daily, in the real world.Overall, great movie!

Donnie on October 2 gets out of bed and goes to Frank.frank, in a way, saved his life. because if DD hadnt moved he would have been smushed. now, DD goes on comitting these acts that frank suggests and seems to get away with them all untill he chooses to go back in time to die so that he can stop being alone. if this is the case then in the end we are brought back to the beginning where reality starts. if he would have died in that room, even if all of the other 112 minutes of the movie actually happend, we wouldnt have known, because we wouldnt have sen him live them, because he went back and chose to die.

( i know this sounds really bad but its a complex and confusing subject. ) so now we have DD dead because of engine x. now where did engine x come from? in the movie we are shown that it comes from the plane that DD's mother and sister are on. well if engine x really did kill DD then i think engine x would have had to come from somewhere else. here is why. you have to ask yourself why were DD's mother and sister on that plane. they were on it because they were coming home from a big competition of some sort where everyone seemed to be excited. if DD died aprox. a month earlier i dont think that his mother and sister would be on a plane coming back from a dance competition. i just dont think that they would be up to the trip you know what i mean.This is when i get confused...because then you have to ask yourself about religion and all of that... would someone answer there questions...1)why does DD's mom stop crying and wave at DD's would have been future girlfriend at the end? 2) what is the name and artist of that song at the end of the movie i believe it was called Mad World or somthing like that. 3)why does the teacher sit up in the end...what relivance does that have? 4)who is the guy in the red jump suit and does it have a religious referance? 5)what relevance does the chinese girl have and DD's name written on her book? also whats the deal with the ear muffs. 6)when Dres Barrymore walks out after being fired what does she stop yelling and look at the little girl as though they are communication or have communicated before about somthing that seems to be rather important(i dunno about you, but thats the feeling i got when i saw that pause in the movie) 7)Why doesnt DD just go talk to Grandma Death and get her opinion on whats going on and her help as well? 8)if frank was real and the whole thoery of time travel is real then why cant DD's little sister see him..and why cant we see him in certain frames while they are in the theatre? ( i know hes supposed to be an imaginary friend but he was real at one time so i am confused) ","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"11 January 2003","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  First of all, I would like to make the reader aware that the following commentary will reveal certain elements of the film's plot.  If you would rather not have them revealed, then I would not recommend reading past this paragraph.  However, if you watch the movie, I would urge you to think about the full implications of its various scenes.I watched this film with two friends of mine, and despite the fact that we have fairly liberal views, all three of us (this includes both female and male) were rather appalled at what was shown, and found that there are some serious moral problems at hand.  First and foremost, while some viewers might not realize it, Josh Hartnett's character is raped towards the end of this movie.  His ex-girlfriend has sex with him, while he is tied to a bed, intoxicated, and only marginally aware of what is going on.  In spite of this, the film does not seem to show the seriousness of the incident. The main character seems to be casual about what happened, albeit disappointed that his celibacy did not reach the 40 day mark; his current love interest, played by Shannyn Sossamon, chooses to be angry, instead of being supportive, and his ex-girlfriend revels in snide triumph.  The rape of men by women does occur in real life; it is a horrific crime, as is any other form of rape, and this movie certainly doesn't help in making the society aware of its existence.The film also paints an inaccurate and incomplete picture of human sexuality, since men are portrayed as sex fiends, who find it next to impossible to not be controlled by their desires, while women are depicted as manipulative whores.  Shannyn Sossamon's aforementioned character is an exception, but she appears to be emotionally unstable, since she walks out whenever there is a problem, instead of making an attempt to communicate. When the main character ends up with her, this is treated as an and they lived happily ever after sort of ending, whereas realistically, what he probably has in store for him is another psychologically-damaging relationship.The problem at hand is not in what happens in the film, but in the film's attitude towards what happens.  I am not saying that a rape scene in a movie is always unacceptable.  What I am saying, is that such a scene should be treated as a rape scene, and not as a casual sexual encounter.  While I believe in artistic freedom, I also believe that film producers hold a level of responsibility for the sort of message that they carry across, and that is why I felt that something needed to be said.  I would generally not recommend this movie, but to those who are planning on watching it - please be aware of what is going on.

","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"11 January 2003","score":"112 out of 166 people found the following review useful","review":"  Oliver Stone is undoubtedly one of the most controversial directors of all time, his work has included horrifyingly real stories of Vietnam, stories of the corruption of politics and a much-despised account of Jim Morrison's life. No matter the subject matter, Stone always gives it his all and sometimes the world's response is positive and sometimes it's negative. With JFK we are faced with one of his films that was probably one of his most successful (next to Platoon of 1986). This is a rare instance in which the public loved the concept of conspiracy in their own country, and took special interest in the debates that it caused amongst the government upon release. The best thing about this film is that it is and was treated as so much more than a film. My honest opinion is that this response was created not because of a more plausible theory but because of Stone's fantastic and unique job putting the story together.The film opens on a surprisingly suspenseful scene of the murder of John F. Kennedy. The chopped style of the scene lets you know that something is not right, dramatic black and white shots spliced with the blurry grain shots of the home video taken by a witness (it won Academy Awards for Best Film Editing and Best Cinematography). This, accompanied by John Williams' excellent original score helped do an excellent job of creating a mood, just for this very first scene. Often times a director will stop after this, give it his all for style and then stop after the first scene, but Stone doesn't do this. He makes the film so much more than a boring investigation; he takes you in to each of the puzzle pieces  (indeed, it feels like you're with Kevin Costner digging through hundreds of events.) For 90% of these clips that lace the film's concepts together, the camera is not kept steady, it is, indeed, like you are there witnessing it. The human eye doesn't only look at what is important, and a situation of trauma can make everything seem broken, confused. Oliver Stone doesn't try to make sure you understand what's going on. Some frown upon this, but it's realistic and that's what counts.Kevin Costner plays Jim Garrison, the district attorney of New Orleans who investigates the murder of John Kennedy. Sometimes you are expected to disagree (at first) with some of Garrison's presumptuous statements, and when you do there is always at least one character around who will agree with you. Stone realizes most viewers aren't devoted enough to believe everything Garrison says no matter what it is throughout the film. Stone has said that he wants people to rethink history and that this film is not guaranteed fact, but an alternate myth to the myth that has been presented before. The story is not solid because very few ideas or people or events in life are. What I mean to say is that Garrison's comments are not necessarily ridiculous, it's just a matter of how hard he tries to support them. The focus constantly changes -- yes, Costner will smile a bit when he makes a ridiculous remark that everyone rolls their eyes at, yes, even at the end of the film some clips will be left unchecked, and yes, you will see that there is no way that the question who killed JFK is answered as simply, solidly, and, dare I say it, Hollywood-esquely as a one man killing. If you watch this movie looking for real life, without dramatization and without guaranteed entertainment and fun, you will be impressed. This is not a popcorn movie.And finally a word should be said about the actors' enhancement of the realism of the film. Most notable are Joe Pesci as the frantic David Ferrie who pretends to be a victim but truly (we see) had much more to do with it than he pretends (although convincingly was not an assassin -- he blows the whole thing out of proportion this is too f*cking big for you, you know that?) and Tommy Lee Jones as the wry ring leader Claw Shaw, who seems to be a pompous upscale member of society that has been doing the dark business of conspiracy behind closed doors. The fact that these characters can appear real to us and not just appear as familiar actors taking on a role (as you might feel in Ocean's Eleven) truly does the film justice in driving it forward.This is in fact one of my top three favorite movies, but I tend to refrain from mentioning it as just this to my friends-- I'm sooner to mention Memento or Fight Club. The reason for this is that the movie is almost an acquired taste, and certainly not normal entertainment for a teenager. It's honestly written for a generation above me, but everything that makes it (up to and including the kings are killed and other political themes) are intriguing to me, and for me anything intriguing grows to be a favorite. Even if the subject is not something that ever really impacted me, I take themes to heart, and I always love a good enigma wrapped in a riddle.NOTES -Maybe a point off for being inconsistent in goal. Though as admirable in a movie as any other characteristic, I found this to be the most restricting on ability to follow along. -Also notable is the fact that it's very release sparked opening of sealed governmental records on the subject.OVERALL A+ ","genre":null},{"date":"11 January 2003","score":"112 out of 166 people found the following review useful","review":"  Oliver Stone is undoubtedly one of the most controversial directors of all time, his work has included horrifyingly real stories of Vietnam, stories of the corruption of politics and a much-despised account of Jim Morrison's life.

Some frown upon this, but it's realistic and that's what counts.Kevin Costner plays Jim Garrison, the district attorney of New Orleans who investigates the murder of John Kennedy. Sometimes you are expected to disagree (at first) with some of Garrison's presumptuous statements, and when you do there is always at least one character around who will agree with you. Stone realizes most viewers aren't devoted enough to believe everything Garrison says no matter what it is throughout the film. Stone has said that he wants people to rethink history and that this film is not guaranteed fact, but an alternate myth to the myth that has been presented before. The story is not solid because very few ideas or people or events in life are. What I mean to say is that Garrison's comments are not necessarily ridiculous, it's just a matter of how hard he tries to support them. The focus constantly changes -- yes, Costner will smile a bit when he makes a ridiculous remark that everyone rolls their eyes at, yes, even at the end of the film some clips will be left unchecked, and yes, you will see that there is no way that the question who killed JFK is answered as simply, solidly, and, dare I say it, Hollywood-esquely as a one man killing. If you watch this movie looking for real life, without dramatization and without guaranteed entertainment and fun, you will be impressed. This is not a popcorn movie.And finally a word should be said about the actors' enhancement of the realism of the film. Most notable are Joe Pesci as the frantic David Ferrie who pretends to be a victim but truly (we see) had much more to do with it than he pretends (although convincingly was not an assassin -- he blows the whole thing out of proportion this is too f*cking big for you, you know that?) and Tommy Lee Jones as the wry ring leader Claw Shaw, who seems to be a pompous upscale member of society that has been doing the dark business of conspiracy behind closed doors. The fact that these characters can appear real to us and not just appear as familiar actors taking on a role (as you might feel in Ocean's Eleven) truly does the film justice in driving it forward.This is in fact one of my top three favorite movies, but I tend to refrain from mentioning it as just this to my friends-- I'm sooner to mention Memento or Fight Club. The reason for this is that the movie is almost an acquired taste, and certainly not normal entertainment for a teenager. It's honestly written for a generation above me, but everything that makes it (up to and including the kings are killed and other political themes) are intriguing to me, and for me anything intriguing grows to be a favorite. Even if the subject is not something that ever really impacted me, I take themes to heart, and I always love a good enigma wrapped in a riddle.NOTES -Maybe a point off for being inconsistent in goal.

No matter the subject matter, Stone always gives it his all and sometimes the world's response is positive and sometimes it's negative. With JFK we are faced with one of his films that was probably one of his most successful (next to Platoon of 1986). This is a rare instance in which the public loved the concept of conspiracy in their own country, and took special interest in the debates that it caused amongst the government upon release. The best thing about this film is that it is and was treated as so much more than a film. My honest opinion is that this response was created not because of a more plausible theory but because of Stone's fantastic and unique job putting the story together.The film opens on a surprisingly suspenseful scene of the murder of John F. Kennedy. The chopped style of the scene lets you know that something is not right, dramatic black and white shots spliced with the blurry grain shots of the home video taken by a witness (it won Academy Awards for Best Film Editing and Best Cinematography). This, accompanied by John Williams' excellent original score helped do an excellent job of creating a mood, just for this very first scene. Often times a director will stop after this, give it his all for style and then stop after the first scene, but Stone doesn't do this. He makes the film so much more than a boring investigation; he takes you in to each of the puzzle pieces  (indeed, it feels like you're with Kevin Costner digging through hundreds of events.)

This was both a blessing and a curse. There are many other great films like this one which deserve to be shown more often on network TV. But they never will because of the royalties involved and the fact that they would never make that money back. But when a forgotten film is shown regularly on TV it can trigger a positive audience response and get a fan base for the film that it would not have otherwise had, as was the case here.

With this particular film there seems to be people who need to watch it religiously each year, and others who get frankly tired of it. My opinion is that IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is a very good film. Certainly a very emotional ending. But labeling it a Christmas movie is nonsense and it was never intended to be shown only at the holidays. It is a motion picture, just like any other, and deserves to be watched objectively. That's what I'll do here. How does it compare to other similar films? Well, for one thing, I find that this film can convey some very strong emotions for a nearly 60 year old film. Another example is CITY LIGHTS, by Charlie Chaplin, which can still move audiences to tears 70 years after its release. I find the acting to be quite good, but it's worth noting that this shouldn't be surprising considering the first-rate cast (especially Stewart and Barrymore).  I find the script to be generally rather weak, incidentally. I feel that the sheer great acting manages to overcome some fairly cliched lines and situations. Still there are also some memorably original sequences like the high school dance.  The direction by Capra is excellent as always. It is not without good reason that he is considered one of America's foremost filmmakers. He definitely is not afraid to play scenes for ultimate emotional content which adds strongly to the personal and human element of his films. From a technical aspect, I find this film to be quite well made, especially given its low budget. The giant street set is quite convincing in creating a whole little world inhabited by the movie's characters. The location footage of the early suburban neighborhoods is an interesting record. The story itself is good but I feel that the entire concept of the angel was simply a cop-out. In earlier Capra efforts, the main character overcame adversity with effort and common sense. But this guardian angel device is complete fantasy. I guess it works to some extent but I found it to be an easy out. How does it rank against Capra's other films? Well, obviously nothing can touch the brilliant, landmark IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT. One of the very funniest films ever made, and one of the very best.   Also, I don't think IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is as successful in maintaining a theme as MR. DEEDS (1936). I would rank it after those two, earlier Capra efforts. Generally if I *have* to watch a christmas movie it would be Laurel and Hardy's BABES IN TOYLAND. IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is a very good film, and deserves to be shown. But so do many other films.

I feel another release of 1946, DETOUR, by Edgar G. Ulmer, is a much better film. ","genre":"Drama, Family, Fantasy"}]
