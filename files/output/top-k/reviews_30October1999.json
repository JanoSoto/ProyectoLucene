I think Body Shots is one of those films.  This is a film that takes a very frank stand about sex and dating rituals not just in the 90's but ( in my opinion ) of all time.  Sex is almost a necessity in many people's lives.  You may not die without it but some people do change when they are getting it or not getting it.  Body Shots does a very good job of showing the compulsions of sexually active people, some of the strange fetishes that other people have, how sex with love will always be better than sex without it and it also shows that sex is not a bad thing the way it is portrayed in society, even if it is between two people that are just using each other to get off.  This is a very honest film in the way that it speaks and the way it listens.  Not everyone is like these characters, but I'm willing to bet that there are a lot more that are like them than what people realize or want to admit they realize.  I am not talking about the  he said she said rape take in the film, but the talk and exploration into sexual practises is interesting, funny, shocking and fun to watch all at once.There are a few true strengths to the film.  First, it has to be said the cast is great.  There are so many young bright faces in here and they shine with this controversial subject matter.  I could go on and name all eight of the characters and the people that play them and give each of them equal praise but that would almost be redundant and may bore you, so what I will do is tell you some of my favourite performances in the film.  First is Amanda Peel and Sean Michael Flannery.  They play Jane and Rick respectively.  Both are very attractive people ( physically and intellectually ) and they seem to be the ones that carry the film.  They seem to be the ones that are most serious about starting a relationship. And they like each other, so that sets up the love interest.  But then the alleged rape takes place between two of their friends and suddenly what looks to be a sure love connection is jeopardized.  But instead of doing what all films do when they make the two meet, like each other, break up and then get back together, the film is more intelligent than that.  First of all they never really consumated their relationship so they can't really break up, but what they do is realize that what they could have may be special and that no matter the circumstances it may be worth a chance to get together.  They play these roles with care and compassion for their characters and I really liked them in this film.Tara Reid is a great new actress on the scene as she was one of the bright spots in the abyssmally awful Urban Legend and she was terrific in American Pie.  Here she is not a very likable person but she plays it so well.  I also want to mention Ron Livingstone from Office Space.  He cracks me up. And Emily Procter as Whitney.  Not only is she beautiful but she can act and she does an admirable job in here with a difficult role.  But she handles it with class, dignity and humour.  If you watch this film, it is her character that is the most secretive of all of them, but she is also one of best parts of the film.  I see her going on to be big in Hollywood.What is also good about the film is the dialogue.  It has a good ear and knows how some people talk.  I was laughing in all the right places and somber and intrigued when I was supposed to be.  Jerry O'Connell has a very powerful and eye opening speech when he is confronted with what he is up against.Body Shots is not afraid to talk openly and crudely about sex and all that encompasses it.  Everything from blowjobs to cunnilingus to raunchy sex to making love, it is all in here.  I admire the film for being something different.  This is not a typical entry into the raunchy sex genre.  It is raunchy but it is well done and that is what separates it from the rest of the pack.  It will not be around long at the theater so if you get a chance, you should take a chance and see this film.  I enjoyed what it had to say, and how they said it.  You may not agree with what it has to say, but you may also be entertained and feel a smile creep along your face as you disagree with it.  Not many films can make you do that.

Flash forward seventy or so years.

The people that get invited aren't the ones on eithers list, though. They get to the house and you can see for yourself what happens next.Even after the amazing disapointment that was The Haunting the trailer for this film still looked promising(with the exception of the ghost effects). Haunted Hill had a number of things going for it a great cast; a good story; a perfect setting. Unlike The Haunting, this one decided to actually be frightening. The set design alone is enough to set one on edge. This film takes the term Gothic to an extreme. Of course, a large portion of the credit goes to William Malone.

Spawn had better acting. Plan 9 from Outer Space had better special effects. Police Academy V had more coherent direction. And 10,000 Years BC had a better script. Perhaps I can excuse the lack of anything like a script, direction, acting, etc. that might qualify it as a movie. After all, it was shot by amateurs who never dreamed it would get widespread cinema release, never mind this high a profile. What I can't excuse is the complete lack of entertainment value. Any good movie must have a good story to tell, with characters the audience cares about. Blair Witch has neither. There is no plot to spoil, and the three characters are equally whiny and annoying. There are also huge gaping holes in the plot, but I won't mention these now as they've been discussed to death in Usenet.I wanted to walk out several times, but I just had to watch it til the end to see what all the fuss was about, and in case some miracle happens at the end to make it worthwhile. It didn't. It was pathetically naff. It was so bad I've seen better home movies about family holidays in Crete. I guess this film is the biggest testament to the power of media hype and guerilla marketing, and I respect that. But boy, did it stink. At the end of it all, some people in the theatre were furious. Some even demanded their money back from the box office, something unheard of in my experience!Critics are raving about how this was made on only $50,000. My point of view is, what a waste of $50K. And I wonder what it was spent on? I agree with Chris Rock's verdict I swear there's gotta be someone out there walking around with $49,500 dollars in his pocket.

I commented that it looked like a poster that was from the 70's.  If you remember the poster for Amityville Horror, then you may recall that it had the same look to it that this one does.  And I thought to myself that this must be a good sign.  Most of the great horror films have come out of the 70's and early 80's.  And with this one looking and feeling like an older horror film, it gave me much hope.  Thankfully I was right and I was in for a treat when I watched this film.  First off it has to be said that the beginning of this film is as graphic and twisted as perhaps a film like Last House on the Left and it reminded me of the ILSA films.  It takes place in an insane assylum and then unspeakable things happen and when people die in here, it is quite graphic and terrifying.  There is no playing games here.  The go for the gusto and they remind you that this is what horror is all about.  The first ten minutes of the film is what classic horror is and should be.  But that also left me frightened.  How does the film keep up with what it started?  Can it keep me as scared as it did in the first few reels?  And the answer is YES!  It does stay spooky and scary.  The location in this film is one of the great things about it.  Where as the Haunting wasn't scary partly because of the lame surroundings, this film is scary because the house feels bad.  It looks menacing and there are lots of rooms shown to us where unspeakably bad things happened in them.  If there is going to be rooms where spirits live on and want revenge, then this is the place for that to happen.  There is one part in the film that is one of the scarier sequences that I have ever seen in a film and it is where one of the participants sees what has to be a ghost in one of the rooms, and then it charges after her and.... well it does something.  But the camera work and music and lighting all combine to make you jump in utter fear.  The House On Haunted Hill is a great addition to the scary movies that have come out this year.  This films does have a really weak ending and some of the music is too Rob Zombieish when it would be better served if it was more like Halloween music, but other than those two small complaints, I'd have to say that this is am intensely scary film and it should be seen and appreciated.  Oh yea, one other good thing, it has Ali Larter in it.  Remember the whip cream bikini girl from Varsity Blues?  Well no whip cream or other pastry ideas in this film for her, but she is still great to look at.

I so thoroughly enjoyed it that now I'm interested in more by director Peter Chan and screenwriter Maria Maggenti.  I did not know there was a book, either, but I've made a note of it for future reading, too.I admit I feel a bit defensive now, in the face of the other comments here on IMDB.  So, what did I like and why did I like it?  First of all, unlike some other viewers, I thought the movie WAS very funny.  It takes sort of a Steve-Martinesque view of the tender absurdity of humans and their feelings about each other (OK, OK, I just saw a stage production of Picasso at the Lapin Agile, and the tone reminded me somewhat of this).  Although there is physical humor, too, what I liked most were light touches, like how Ellen DeGeneres' character instantly, wordlessly went back to working for her boss (played by Kate Capshaw) as soon as she got the apology she felt she deserved -- after insisting with great finality that it was all over.I also felt this film was a celebration of the beautiful but almost lunatic breadth and diversity of the kinds of feelings we group together under the heading of love  everything from young (and older) wide-eyed lust, to slow steady enduring commitment.  As well as friendships, coworker relationships like the one just mentioned, family bonds . . . the list goes on.Most of all, I guess I appreciated the fond, loving tone of the movie.  The artists seem really to like, and love, people.  Yes, there ARE quite a few characters, and they're all different ages and different sexes, they're about different trials and tribulations, but they're all treated with light-hearted love and respect, for the sometimes silly but vulnerable beings we all are.So, if YOU like people, I think you'd like this movie.

Their smiles and joyful expressions make one wonder why no other casting director has come up with the idea of having the two of them star in a romantic comedy before. Unfortunately, Rob Reiner's The Story of Us, isn't about marriage, love at first sight, or happy times, but about an unhappy couple's divorce procedures and how two people can fall out of love in a matter of time. How depressing, indeed. The film consists of dozens of unorganized flashbacks explaining to us the up's and many down's of a married life in America, as well as the two past love birds, Ben and Katie Jordan's, attempts to keep their marital problems from their two young children.The individual scenes featuring Ben and Katie either bonding or fighting are at times quite powerful and involving, as well as some emotionally on target moments along with some funny humor present--but all the good sequences are brief and chopped-up. The story is so uneven it's very hard to become intrigued with anything going on. There is a nice sequence that takes place in Italy where Ben and Katie try to escape from their problems and jump start their love--what they don't realize is that their good old selves will be waiting on the front porch when they return home.  The problem with the film's singular scenes being effective is that they do not all fit together like they should, not to mention the heartache to develop and introduce the main characters through the flashbacks.  That is not an easy thing to do, and The Story of Us is not a smart enough movie to figure out how to do those things properly. The characters are acutely quite the treat. They are wonderfully played by top notch actors, some not commonly known for such roles as these, including Bruce Willis, Michelle Pfeiffer, Rob Reiner, Rita Wilson, and even Mad About You's Paul Reiser. There's much charming romantic chemistry between Willis and Pfeiffer, but like I said, all the characters do is argue and swear at the other. The kids aren't detailed enough to care about, thus we don't care about the turning point in the middle of the film. Pfeiffer's performance at the very end of the movie, where it should be serious and intense, comes off as whiny, sissified, and annoying. I can't figure out how she screwed this one up. She's a good actress, right? The structure in The Story of Us, is anything but ordinary. Author Thomas Pope once said that there is such a justification in the extremely rare case of a movie being about life the structure called life. There are certain incidences here that have a first act, second act, then conclusion, but no outright formula. But in this rare exception, the structure's material is fitting. Life has no structure to it, and for this movie to contain such realism, it must also not. This makes the story believable, engaging, and realistic; this reminds me of what many couples go through in present day in America. The Story of Us, contains such a flawed motive it's hard to imagine how this project could have worked. While I won't reveal the film's ending, I will say that the filmmakers throw their preparation for a depressing finale out the window and give us a conventional, but satisfying, conclusion. Perhaps if the writers would have used the flashbacks in sequence order, or taken a completely different view at the events, maybe through the eyes of the kids, possibly then the movie would have been a success. It is hard to tell, really. I personally think this film was doomed before it got the green light. It isn't the actors' faults, nor necessarily the director, Rob Reiner. It's just everything combined in a negative way.There is a scene in The Story of Us where the meaning of the message in this movie flashes before our eyes. It is a sequence present in the film's trailers, and is made up of Katie's brief, intercut flashbacks reflecting back on all the good and bad times of the their 15 year marriage. The scene works in every way possible. And in some ways, it makes a long story short for us, summing up the entire film's existence. I don't know why this scene is so effective, but I do know one thing if the entire movie was as focused and meaningful as that, we may have had something here.Brought to you by Universal Pictures.

It is hard to tell, really. I personally think this film was doomed before it got the green light. It isn't the actors' faults, nor necessarily the director, Rob Reiner. It's just everything combined in a negative way.There is a scene in The Story of Us where the meaning of the message in this movie flashes before our eyes. It is a sequence present in the film's trailers, and is made up of Katie's brief, intercut flashbacks reflecting back on all the good and bad times of the their 15 year marriage. The scene works in every way possible. And in some ways, it makes a long story short for us, summing up the entire film's existence. I don't know why this scene is so effective, but I do know one thing if the entire movie was as focused and meaningful as that, we may have had something here.Brought to you by Universal Pictures.

Things begin well enough, though, with two brothers meandering through life.  They like to steal cars, get high, and ask each other pointless questions, some of which are actually funny.  Their world is in shambles.  They have no friends, their hometown is a dump, and their family is a rather pathetic lot, even if they're presented in a positive light.  All of this makes the brothers' oblivion to the world somehow attractive.  The other characters in the film are equally ridiculous - corrupt cops, karaoke nuts, and vulgar nouveau riche types. It's fun to laugh when the brothers' pranks catch these folks off guard.However, the film takes an ugly, brutal, and somewhat sadistic turn.  Jokes develop into murder, and comedic situations into depictions of suffering. In principle, I don't have anything against murder or violence in films, but these elements spoiled this particular film.  In addition, only a small percentage of the jokes are funny to begin with, and you must have a very discerning ear to sift through the strong Welsh accent.  The box cover bragged of a tie to Trainspotting (I can't remember how). The film is nothing like Trainspotting.
