In addition, if you're not able to take a an action political thriller movies, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.The Jackal (1997) is one of the best political action thriller movies I have ever seen. It is entertaining enough and worth seeing on it's own. It is million times way better than the movies that are made today. The gory violence of The Jackal is a big screw you to PG-13 thriller movies. The movie is very enjoyable it has everything in it. The acting in this movie is very realistic and superb. The action is non stop and intense and delivers on a good way. Bruce Willis did outstanding acting performance of the character Jackal. He acted the role perfectly and very believable realistic. He was cold ruthless man with thousand names and thousand faces and mystery disguise. He killed anyone who figure it out his true identity or was suspecting him. He used a lot of guns and weapons. This movie made from the book was brilliant and intense packed so that the viewer is hooked up on the edge of a seat and keeps guessing what will happened next. This is the first time I saw Bruce Willis playing a villain in the movie and did gave us superb acting performance. He did in this film a masterful performance ever.The acting in this movie is very realistic and phenomenal and I mean from everyone who played in here. This movie delivers a surprising top notch entertaining with a potent story and some good twists that help to live up expectations. This is Michael Caton-Jones's best movie to date and that he ever made. The director did an outstanding direction debut and knew what he was doing. Richard Gere as Declan Mulqueen an Irish Republican Army sniper who was locked and imprisoned in maximum security did and outstanding job helping the FBI and Russian Police tracking down an intelligent and genius assassin down. Richard Gere was very convincing in his role as an Irish, his ascent was more British than American. Even for American his ascent was convincing. I thought that Richard Gere could have been the next James Bond 007 not that we have Daniel Craig in it.This is Sidney Poitier's final film appearance to date. I think he acted convincing and it was his best performance I have ever seen! Sidney Poiter played three times an FBI agent that I counted. Twice in a year 1988 Shoot To Kill and Little Nikita and the third time in this movie in the year 1997. I don't count other movies he played in the 70's. I am glad that he is still alive. The last actress I wanna say that I love in here is Diane Venora as Major Valentina Koslova, MVD. This was her last and I mean last acting debut of her role of a tough woman. I never saw her in any other roles like are that now, she even wear a scars on her face, It was outstanding. I only wish that Diane Venora would get more roles like is this one. She was awesome and I loved her, the death scene was really amazing no one could acted better.With these players set in motion, it's up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. (One often sees great performances in mediocre films... here the story transcends the performances -- an impressive feat.) The script delivers. The action scenes were incredible and very fantastic. The shout out scenes are incredible and outstanding executed. Even Jack Black has a small role in it. The most awesome scene that I have in mind is the helicopter when US Marine sniper Akashi (Daniel Dae Kim) gives the rifle Heckler & Koch SR(TC) to Declan Mulqueen (Richard Gere), who uses the rifle to shoot the scope off of The Jackal's (Bruce Willis) automated machine gun. Akashi then uses the rifle to shoot the gas tank and ignite the fuel, blowing up the SUV housing the gun. That scene was realistic I am pretty sure that Richard Gere had a lot of practice with the riffle, before he was in front the camera shooting with the riffle in the film.The face off between The Jackal (Bruce Willis) and Declan Mulqueen (Richard Gere) was phenomenal! It was so realistic acting performance that I seriously believe it and I was convinced that the acting is and the story evolves in realistic world. I'm not sure what else would you want in a movie like this? Probably moral content, the movie portrayed and executed perfectly the book. I have very enjoyed this movie from beginning till the end it is my favorite best action thriller ever. I am giving it 10\/10.The Jackal is the 1997 action thriller starring Richard Gere as a former IRA sniper who is recruited by the FBI to track down a professional assassin known as The Jackal (Bruce Willis), who has been hired by a Russian mobster to eliminate a major American political figure. The film is a loose remake of the 1973 thriller The Day of the Jackal.\/ That is the basic plot and I think this movie deserved to bashed or hated for.

I didn't even know how he looked, just had a vague recollection of his name. I got a pirated DVD of American films from the 70s and it had Annie Hall in it. It was the last film from the DVD that I saw. A lot of the philosophy in the film went over my head at that moment, but the humour left me in splits. There are times when you more than just like something, but you can't exactly give a reason why. I felt like that for the film. Of course I can give a thousand different reasons to like every Woody film now, but at 16, I couldn't. I just knew that I loved the film. And what I liked best in the film was the guy who played Alvy Singer, and when he broke the 4th wall to address us directly. I hadn't gone through the credits and didn't know that the guy was Woody himself. I had a slow dial up connection and made good use of it to find more information about the film. And that's when I learnt that Woody didn't just direct it, he wrote as well as acted in it. And Diane Keaton was his one time girlfriend. Hell, I wanted a girlfriend like Diane Keaton, its a completely different thing though, that in my teens, I ended up with someone like Mia Farrow, which pretty much messed things up a lot !! Anyway, after reading more about Woody and his many talents, I became fascinated with the man. Even more so because I could personally relate to him. He was short, shy, neurotic and had a lot to say. That pretty much summed me up as well. I so wanted to be like Woody Allen. The next plan of action was to watch as many Woody films as possible. I didn't have enough pocket money to buy over 35 original DVDs worth over 500 bucks each, and Downloading wasn't an option then. So I went around pirated DVD stores looking for films directed by Woody and within 2 months I managed to find around 20 !! Its been 9 years since then, and I've seen every single film written, directed or acted by Woody and I love every single one of them. Woody means different things to different people, but to me, he is the man who taught me to laugh at myself. And because I have a similar cynical world view to his, it was a terrific thing to learn. Also, I don't think anybody else understands Women better than Woody and watching and re-watching his films meant entering inside the mysterious minds of the fairer sex. Trust me, for all the guys who don't look like Brad Pitt or aren't sons of Warren Buffett, and want to get laid, watch Woody Films. His films also subtly introduced me to the intriguing and revealing world of Freud and Psychotherapy, and I've been hooked. Given a chance, I would exhume his brain and build a shrine around it !!
