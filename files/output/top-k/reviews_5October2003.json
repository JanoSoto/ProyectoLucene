[{"date":"5 October 2003","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  Bedrooms & Hallways starts off with a funny idea, and has some fun characters.  The witty banter between the friends is well written, and the acting is well done.  I enjoyed all the performances. The movie was lucky to have some wonderful actors.  The movie is unpredictable, and fun to watch, but...the ending is not what I would have liked...and it did not ring true to me, considering the characters involved.  Nonetheless, the movie reflects good writing, good direction, and top notch production values.  The actors really are good, & the movie is worth watching for the comedic situations alone.  Kevin McKidd plays the main character, and he is fantastic -- he is sweet & funny & genuine, and he does a great job playing a regular guy who happens to be gay.  This is not a plot spoiler, as this is what the movie is all about...and the quest for him & his friends to find romance.  Kevin has played macho men in Dog Soldiers and Trainspotting, and in this film you can watch him become someone completely different, yet he is still totally natural and believable.  I was very impressed.  The film can boast perfect casting--all parts, leading & supporting, were brought to life by a talented cast.  Other than the ending, which you will need to see for yourself, I was very entertained.  Good show.

He was on a job for a major criminal where he had to deliver 100,000DM to him at noon.  However during the job the money got left on the train and now he is standing asking Lola to help him or else he'll rob a local supermarket in 20 minutes.  Lola has 20 minutes to raise the money and get it to Manni.  However there is no room for error and her decisions are life or death.I, like everyone else, had heard this film's reputation long before I got round to seeing it and didn't need to be encouraged to see it when it came onto network tv.  I didn't know the detail of the film and I had an open mind but I did expect it to be worthy of the praise garnered on it.  Sadly the film disappoints on almost every level except one &#150; style.  Visually the film is energetic, with running and a race against time being the key and a pumping techno style soundtrack the film shamelessly goes after the youth market &#150; and gets it.  The mix of cartoon and live action sequences is not well done but adds to the (false) impression that this is something new and daring.  Even with the constant fast cuts edits and visual tricks I still wasn't drawn in by the action, it is all quite flat and lifeless &#150; vans drive through plate glass for no other reason than to allow a slowmo shot of breaking glass etc.A big reason the action fails is the total lack of characters.  With almost no development I couldn't get into any of the characters and could not care about them &#150; they were merely dolls that the director took delight in throwing around as part of his visual melee.  The plot itself is also pretty weak &#150; it makes me laugh to hear it described on these pages as daring or fresh &#150; it is merely an old chestnut twisted to be 3 or 4 different version of the same old chestnut.  The twists and turns are simply absurd and the film doesn't even try to explain them &#150; excusing them as merely part of the hyper-kinetic film being delivered!Potente tries hard as Lola and is pretty good looking running around in her small vest.  I imagine the ability to shift posters of her in this film to student bedrooms around the world has helped this film no end.  Bleibtreu's is a non-character and his plight stems from his own stupidity.  Support characters are non existent and exist only to be a plot driver to allow things to happen.Overall this is not an awful film just a hollow and pointless one.  Style is important in any film and sometimes style can cover the weaknesses in substance, however here the substance has no weakness &#150; it is a black hole filled by fancy editing, split screens and other such tricks.  Characters are nowhere to be seen, genuine tension or excitement has left the building and the plot is a very simple set up which tries to hide it's ordinariness behind the time jumping gimmick.  I honestly cannot believe that this is in the top 100 at the time of writing and I will continue to read other reviews and listen to other opinions in an effort to understand how anyone could consider this anything other than flashy nonsense which is forgotten before the end credits roll.
