I am always very skeptical when I begin watching a movie and I suspect it to be real in that sense that it doesn't have logic errors or lacking realism in general. Of course, in a sci-fi these borders are pushed in contrast to a regular drama. However, when seeing how Cruise moves his hands in front of the screens (which felt like several minutes) I couldn't help myself but saying Hey - stop already! It's neither cool nor interesting to see. It WOULD have worked if Cruise would have had some Japanese elegance in his movements, but he hadn't. It simply looked awkward, or the timing between his movements and the images was wrong.Considering the whole movie, I felt that they tried too hard. This is what I think some of the filmmakers dialogue would have been How do we make the future look cool? Well, we use all this cool colored lights pointed at the camera. And we have found out these übercool screens which you control by the movements of your hands. These Hollywood productions often focus on some aspects of the technology too much. They simplify it, tells how it works in a very brief statement and then the audience is to believe it. I didn't.This film follows the de facto recipe of Hollywood productions. If you know what to look for, you can easily predict what will happen in the film. There are numerous examples The home video showing Cruise's son, the dialogue about how the eyes can be exchanged to mask ones identity. It's just too obvious that Cruise's son is dead and that he is going to buy a new pair of eyes. When things are too obvious like this - you don't buy the story.For me, I need a movie to be serious all together to take it seriously, to believe it, to feel one with the story and then give it high ratings because I liked it. When these comic reliefs are added it totally destroys that mystic cool auro of the future that the movie did manage to portray later in the film.In despite of my critique, the movie wasn't only bad. OK, the car factory plant being there to show off the Lexus didn't really help to get into the annals of best picture, but there were greater moments.The inventor of the precog was a cool character! She and all her magic surreal plants was a fresh addition to the blasse action elements. The Precog who was on the run was also very interesting. Why? Because it was something new.All in all the movie was too streamlined and ordinary to be a really good sci-fi, although Cruise's performance and the other highlights mentioned above make it a descent film. But the lack of focus is so sad. Why destroy a promising movie by adding comic relief elements?

Another reason why this movie so important is because it is the first Science Fiction film in outer space that plays and looks completely real. This movie is an amazing feat of film-making and editing restraint in that, in this movie, things happen in space at the pace that they should and would - which is slow!

I recorded it for my father, who is a western fan, and watched it with him and my wife.The movie has charismatic performances from Wayne and especially Walter Brennan as the old deputy. He made us laugh out loud several times. True it isn't all action, but more about characters.

Not that this is surprising. By the time part four rolled out of the gate, they had firmly set themselves up to appeal only to the lowest common denominator. It's all their fault.Unlike parts one, two, three, five, six, seven, and eight, part four contains actors who have worked in other productions since. While Corey Feldman has had a less than stellar career due to typecasting, he does turn in a considerably better performance than is the norm for the FT13 series. By comparison to the entire cast of part six, Corey deserved an award of some kind here.Part four begins with a recap of all the grisly events of the previous three parts. No mention is made of the cloth bag, the disco theme, or Betsy Palmer. Not that these elements really make for much of a difference, anyway. Given that Tom Savini allegedly only participated in this film in order to kill off the character he'd created, that should tell one something about what depths the franchise had plummeted to in just four short episodes. Obviously, the producers thought at the time that this really would be the final chapter, too.

By the time the FT13 series had moved onto part nine, the incredible damage done by parts seven and eight needed something exceptional in order to be recovered from.Given that Orion Pictures had released RoboCop the previous year, we cannot lay all the blame for the sheer lameness of this episode upon the MPAA. The MPAA-approved cut that eventually surfaced in theaters instead smacks of Paramount not bothering to go to bat for its product. Whereas Orion Pictures stood up to the MPAA and reminded them that there is, in fact, an audience out there above the age of 17, Paramount dutifully trimmed everything they had spent so much money on photographing.As a result, with a cast a soap opera would reject and a script that Ed Wood would turn his nose up at, FT13 part seven becomes an exercise in boredom. The only thing that distinguishes part seven from the previous six parts is that Kane Hodder plays Jason, but it wasn't until parts nine and ten that he had a decent script to work from. Getting back to part seven for the time being, this was originally where Paramount executives had the idea to pair Jason with Freddy. I suspect the real reason New Line balked at the idea was because of Paramount's inability to make a decent horror film.So, instead of Freddy, Jason is put up against a poor man's Carrie. So far, so good, but the problem here is that the Carrie character, along with the rest of the cast, are so unidimensional that the viewer soon forgets them right after the film has concluded. Edited down to the confines of what Australia's OFLC saw fit to rate M, the sole reason anyone watched FT13 films is effectively gone.It doubtlessly sounds like I'm concentrating entirely on how this episode was unfairly targeted by the censors and pretty much removed of its manhood. If you've read any of my other FT13 reviews, you'll notice that with the lack of memorable actors, original or worthwhile story, and even unique points, FT13 part VII is really just an exercise in wasting ninety minutes worth of film.So dull is FT13 part seven that I don't even recommend wasting a recordable DVD on it, leave alone the thirty-odd dollars it will cost to legitimately own a copy. Thankfully, after the next film, Paramount sold the franchise to New Line and effectively got out of the slasher market, one they never really understood in spite of helping to create one of its staples.If you were expecting me to give FT13 part seven anything other than a one out of ten, you're being too hopeful.

But don't get me wrong, this is not a drawn-out boring movie. It describes Henry Hearst, a community-minded attorney married to the lovely Chantal (Monica Bellucci). Police Capt. Victor Benezet (Freeman) asks Hearst to stop by the police station to confirm his statement about finding the dead body of a young girl. Soon one lie leads to another, which leads to another, and so on. Beneath it all, lies a sordid and malformed relationship with the accused, Hearst, taking police further and further down a rabbit hole. What's unveiled in this film is more than just the killer.It's hard to describe this movie in any detail and still do the reader of this review any justice, if they haven't watched it yet. That's because the spoiler would be to discuss the interrogation, which represents about 85-90% of the movie. I will say that the film takes on the who dunnit theme and delivers excellent plot progression via a police testimony setting. To break the monotonous confines of an interrogation room, the director employs a creative film-school idea in showing the testimony as a flashback, but with the police in the flashback asking questions, as if they were all actually back at the scene of the crime. Very clever and entertaining! Hackman and Freeman give me just one more reason to continue watching their films. And Bellucci continues to live up to the reasons for her international film exposure. I just hope she doesn't do anything like Irreversible again!

Put in a dash of Monica Bellucci and Thomas Jane, and you're left with a more than balanced movie diet.I've heard of some evenings that just went on and on, but the evening Henry Hearst (played by Hackman) is interrogated for the murder of two girls, it seems the longest night of all. But don't get me wrong, this is not a drawn-out boring movie. It describes Henry Hearst, a community-minded attorney married to the lovely Chantal (Monica Bellucci). Police Capt. Victor Benezet (Freeman) asks Hearst to stop by the police station to confirm his statement about finding the dead body of a young girl.

Give me a break guys. James Cameron did a phenomenal job with this movie; it truly brought the Titanic disaster back to life. Mr. Cameron did hundreds of hours (if not thousands) of research on the Titanic, including getting the poignant footage under water of the ship. A lot of facts and history with the Titanic disaster was incorporated into this movie,, giving us all the more reason to love it. Though it was over 3 hours long, I was not bored for one minute and that's very unusual for me to be able to sit through a movie this long. I was captivated by the love story and suspense Mr. Cameron created. The theme song  My Heart Will Go On was perfect for the movie but it was terribly over played on the radio stations during this time. The ending was magnificent and I think everyone in the theatre cried, knowing that almost 2,000 people perished in the end. Yes, there were a couple of corny lines in the movie but no movie is perfect. I think the special effects used while the ship was sinking and the passengers were loading up in the boats, was extremely realistic and just moving. The replica ship used was also incredible. I think both Kate Winslet and Leonardo DeCaprio were fantastic in the lead, though I think Ms. Winslet was a little miscast since she looks a lot older than Leo. I have seen this movie several times and still watch it when it's on television. I do not think any other Titanic movie is superior to this one. **** 1\/2 stars out of 5.

One wonders if it was because they were tired of being punished at the box office for their inability to fight with the MPAA, or simply because they were tired of trying to publicise the results. Either way, the dramatic improvement, quality wise, that the series took after it was out of Paramount's hands is quite amusing to note.Either way, this marks Kane Hodder's second outing as the hockey-masked wildman, and it is certainly one of his more credible offerings. Unlike every other Jason, Kane actually looks the part of someone who spent his entire childhood living in the woods, as the canon would have us believe. The problem here is that thanks to the MPAA and Paramount, he is given sadly little to do that sticks in the mind of the audience as memorable.The support cast are once again as convincing as Peter Jackson promising to respect the integrity of a story. Even the stereotypes they follow seem so hopelessly out of date that one wonders if the FT13 writing staff weren't given a chance to take a peek at some Days Of Our Lives plot lines.

Do Bond films get worse as one gets older? Is possible Pierce Brosnan can be so ill-suited as 007 not only in comparison with Sean Connery but plummy old Roger Moore? Do shoot-outs become less entertaining as one discovers the meaning of real violence? Do sex scenes become less titillating as one realizes the diminishing likelihood of ever getting in a clinch with the likes of Teri Hatcher or Michelle Yoeh?All questions aside, I liked Tomorrow Never Dies. Not loved it, the way I did some truly lame Bond thrillers from the 1970s I grew up with like Diamonds Are Forever. 'Tomorrow Never Dies' is a solid movie, with a creditable performance from Brosnan, nice assistance from Hatcher and Yoeh as two very different types of Bond girls, and a fun concept for a chief villain carried out with campy aplomb by Jonathan Pryce. I really liked Stamper, too, the hard-chinned Aryan muscle man played by Gotz Otto who treats knife wounds like mosquito bites.You also have some terrific moments, especially in the first half, which after a strong opening sequence where Bond breaks up a terrorist arms bazaar, the storyline shifts to Pryce as the unfair and unbalanced media mogul Elliot Carver, who is stirring up a war in the South China Sea in order to launch his new global news network with all the inside dope on the world's biggest story. It's not an accurate depiction of what Rupert Murdoch's about, but its funny satire, especially when Carver starts making for Ms. Yoeh.Two moments in the first half stand out. One is an exposition scene that Bond has with M inside a limo speeding through London. Bond and M throw back some whisky while sunlight casts intricate patterns through the car's interior. It's a stylish way to present what would normally be a dead scene, and the interplay between Bond and Judi Dench's M draws you in.The other scene is Bond's confrontation with evil Dr. Kaufman, played by the always quirky Vincent Schiavelli. Kaufman has the drop on Bond, but like everyone else in these movies, can't quite just shoot him without bragging first. The dialogue here is funnier than you expect, and well-served with just the right amount of menace and drama to keep the scene grounded. Some other goons tell Dr. Kaufman they are having problems breaking into Bond's car. Have you tried the auto club? demands Herr Doktor.But the movie takes a dip shortly after, as Bond plays around with his remote-control BMW in a high-rise garage. Technically, the scene works well enough, but Bond's motives are confusing and there are too many silly moments of convenience, like the way the car manages to cut a high-tension cable the bad guys string up.It is a good film after that, just not as good as before. Carver's big scheme seems a bit dopey the more you think about it (and the film gives you plenty of opportunity to do that.) There's a chase between a motorcycle and a helicopter that's a little too busy and untethered from the rest of the film. I like Brosnan's chemistry with Yoeh, but this is one time the final romantic clinch comes across as tacked on; they're more like partners than lovers. The way Carver's plot comes unglued at the end is entirely too easy.But for all that, I keep coming back to the moments I like. Desmond Llewelyn's final solo turn as Q. Brosnan's quippier moments, like when his BMW starts to talk to him in a stern female voice I think we've met. (Too bad Brosnan seemed to lose his sense of humor as Bond after this.) Most especially, I admire the score by David Arnold, thrown up amazingly well despite the lack of opportunity for post-production work. It's an exciting blend of old Bond themes reworked around fresh orchestration that updates the sound of 007 with clever familiarity.At times, Tomorrow Never Dies succeeds in updating the look and feel of 007, too. But not enough. Like Carver might say, it lacks punch. Maybe that's because while tomorrow never dies, time does pass and we all grow up. That's one thing you and I have over James Bond, for better or worse.

Is possible Pierce Brosnan can be so ill-suited as 007 not only in comparison with Sean Connery but plummy old Roger Moore? Do shoot-outs become less entertaining as one discovers the meaning of real violence? Do sex scenes become less titillating as one realizes the diminishing likelihood of ever getting in a clinch with the likes of Teri Hatcher or Michelle Yoeh?All questions aside, I liked Tomorrow Never Dies. Not loved it, the way I did some truly lame Bond thrillers from the 1970s I grew up with like Diamonds Are Forever. 'Tomorrow Never Dies' is a solid movie, with a creditable performance from Brosnan, nice assistance from Hatcher and Yoeh as two very different types of Bond girls, and a fun concept for a chief villain carried out with campy aplomb by Jonathan Pryce. I really liked Stamper, too, the hard-chinned Aryan muscle man played by Gotz Otto who treats knife wounds like mosquito bites.You also have some terrific moments, especially in the first half, which after a strong opening sequence where Bond breaks up a terrorist arms bazaar, the storyline shifts to Pryce as the unfair and unbalanced media mogul Elliot Carver, who is stirring up a war in the South China Sea in order to launch his new global news network with all the inside dope on the world's biggest story.
