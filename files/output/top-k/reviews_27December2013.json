Who among us did not want to cut off our rivals in love's ear? Who did not resort to sniffing something to get a high (for me it was Vick's Inhaler) - This movie shows us a side to the 80s and human nature that we don't want to admit is there.

While he initially resists hitting his part time lover Dorothy, eventually he gives into it. At one point his steady wonders if he is a detective or a pervert. Very easy to answer that one Sandy - he's a closet fiddling pervert. Why else would he keep going back to Dorothy's apartment when he knew enough the first time that he could get killed. Answer - both he and Dorothy are made for each other - both like getting punished. There is also great humor in this movie and dialog that is so intentionally tacky it shines in it's brilliance. At the first mention of Heineken I thought ah-ha - product placement but it is the Heineken that is Jeff's downfall.

And if you try to interfere, the same thing's just going to happen anyway, and you'll just suffer.Election is Alexander Payne's sophomore film and many consider it to be his best work since it uses some slick and witty dark humor to make a satirical political comedy. Payne manages to mix this political satire with High School life by using the school elections as a metaphor for American politics and in doing so the film is rather successful. Just like that famous short essay written by Robert Fulghum All I Really Need to Learn I Learned in Kindergarten where he claims that if we sticked to the basic rules we learned in kindergarten we would live in a better society, here Payne compares politics to High School elections and shows how corrupt the system actually can be and how selfish these people are. The dirty campaigns all begin in High School and these people seem to be doing things for themselves rather than to help others. I think this is what works best in Payne's ambitious film. I enjoyed the scenes that took place in the High School, but when Payne takes us out of the school to the characters homes it kind of loses its magic. I didn't care very much about their lives outside of school. One of the things that Payne does best is create interesting characters and that is why the actors give engaging performances because they have a lot to work with. These characters are usually dislikable, but somehow we end up routing for one despite all their flaws. Reese Witherspoon's character is so annoying that we actually want Matthew Broderick to succeed despite all the immoral acts he is committing. They both give strong performances, although compared to other Payne films I thought they were the weakest characters. Sideways still remains as my favorite Payne film, but his work here obviously opened a lot of doors for him. Payne is one of the best when it comes to creating Midwestern American characters.Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is a very driven and ambitious student from Carver High who has high goals and expectations for her life. One of those goals is becoming class president, and despite the fact that she is running unopposed she still dedicates most of her time in school to achieving this. Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) is one of her teachers, but he doesn't like her very much because she had an affair with his best friend, Dave (Mark Harelik), a former teacher who got expelled from school when the director found out. Jim, who is married to Diane (Molly Hagan), decides to complicate things for Tracy by convincing the school jock, Paul (Chris Klein) to enter the race. When Paul's lesbian sister, Tammy (Jessica Campbell), discovers that he is campaigning for class president, she decides to run as well to pay him back for dating a former love interest of hers. And soon what seemed to be a simple election becomes chaotic as the dirty campaign begins. Will Tracy achieve her goal or will her teacher crash her dream?The film has each character describe the events that are going on through voice over narrations. At first I thought it didn't work very well as it took me out of the story, but then I understood what Payne was trying to achieve (or at least this is what it transmitted to me), by letting his characters narrate what they were experiencing we understood what they were trying to achieve, the way they wanted others to see them, but of course their actions were completely opposite to the way they wanted to be perceived. It was like their own mask, because they were nothing like what they wanted to be perceived as (take Jim for example who considered himself a likable and influential teacher, but really he ends up being quite the opposite). The characters in this film are very well developed, but they were probably my least favorite from a Payne film. I wasn't a big fan of Chris Klein's performance, but the rest of the cast was pretty strong. The dark humor was witty, but it just wasn't my cup of tea and didn't care for any of the characters.

It is his character that the movie is based around and he steals the scene in most of the movie. Bimbo is the owner of the van but he is pushed to the side with Larry's almost dominant character. The movie looks at the struggle that they go through and how their friendship begins to disintegrate with the van. Larry acts constantly without consulting Bimbo and this angers him greatly. Twice he hires family without even saying anything to Bimbo.There isn't much in the way to comment on this film for it really looks at life of two people in Ireland in the early '90's. Much of the things come out of the two characters and how we watch the friendship fall apart. It is an interesting movie in the way a couple of things are conducted, such as when the van is rolled back to Bimbo's house and a huge crowd follows them, signifying a new start to their seemingly meaningless life.Much of the trouble can be seen with the way Larry treats the privilege of working with Bimbo in the van. He is stubborn and sulks. When given a wage he begins to play union with Bimbo. He treats customers with disrespect and finds himself in trouble numerous times.

These rules are the rules of footballs and the players in the Coyotes are gods.Varisty Blues shows us a town where football fever has become a religion and the football oval is the temple to their god, but their gods change frequently for when the star player becomes severely injured, he vanishes to be replaced by another hero, and this time a reluctant one. What we see in Varsity Blues is a religion that exists - but the movie forces it out. Every football season here in Adelaide everybody goes Crow fanatic (the Crows are one of Adelaide's two football teams).The thing with football here is that there is a lot of hypocrisy - when the team is on a loosing streak everybody hates them and have even booed them off of the field, while when they are on a winning streak, everybody dresses up in red, yellow, and blue, and goes hysterical over them. When confronted with this they claim that they followed the Crows through thick and thin - though we know that this is not true. What I don't like about football is that people will literally throw their responsibilities away when a game is on.Back to Varsity Blues - this movie emphasises the hypocrisy that surrounds football. The religious aspect is brought out with Mox's younger brother who is really deeply religious. He creates his own cult and his father's reply is I don't want to see any more of this - you are going to play football like your brother. Parents fight over who's son is the better football player, and all of them had the same coach - who literally runs the town.Mox is an interesting fellow because he loves football, but detests the way the town idolises it. He states that what he is watching is a corruption of a good thing. He is more interested in a college degree in something that he likes, but his brilliant throw is forcing him to play football and to go down a career path that he does not want to go down. Moreso the coach is forcing the players to play until they are useless. He does not care about his team-member's health he is more interested in winning. Unfortunately for the players, they are becoming crippled and being placed in very complicated and expensive surgery - and once they are gone then they have fallen from grace this is clearly seen when Lance destroys his knee and his girlfriend leaves him for Mox.Varsity Blues is a bit of a slutty movie, but it addresses a very important issue in our society - the way we idolise a sport and place mere mortals upon a pedestal, only to throw them away when they are no longer needed.

The religious aspect is brought out with Mox's younger brother who is really deeply religious. He creates his own cult and his father's reply is I don't want to see any more of this - you are going to play football like your brother. Parents fight over who's son is the better football player, and all of them had the same coach - who literally runs the town.Mox is an interesting fellow because he loves football, but detests the way the town idolises it. He states that what he is watching is a corruption of a good thing. He is more interested in a college degree in something that he likes, but his brilliant throw is forcing him to play football and to go down a career path that he does not want to go down. Moreso the coach is forcing the players to play until they are useless. He does not care about his team-member's health he is more interested in winning. Unfortunately for the players, they are becoming crippled and being placed in very complicated and expensive surgery - and once they are gone then they have fallen from grace this is clearly seen when Lance destroys his knee and his girlfriend leaves him for Mox.Varsity Blues is a bit of a slutty movie, but it addresses a very important issue in our society - the way we idolise a sport and place mere mortals upon a pedestal, only to throw them away when they are no longer needed. I agree with Mox - sport is fun and enjoyable, but it becomes corrupted when people start treating it like a religion.

His victims are mostly teenagers, but he has his eyes set on Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell.) Everyone is watching.Scream was released in December of 1996, before many people had seen it they were calling it DOA. It was during a time were slasher films where starting to die, and only seeing the light of a VHS release. Scream came out and single handily saved horror. Become the 16th highest grossing film of 1996 making over a 100 million at the box office, to mainly positive reviews. It made Neve Campbell a household name and showed the world that Wes Craven still is and always well be the master of horror. Scream blew the doors back open to slasher films and paved the way for the likes of I know what you did last summer, Urban Legends and many many more.Scream has one the best and most shocking openings ever. For 15 minutes we sit on the edge of our seats as we watch a young Casey being harassed as Ghostface keeps calling her on the phone. All he wants to do is play a game, sounds simple enough. Only he is outside her window watching her, and his game is horror movie trivia, a game that always proves to be deadly. None of the viewers seen this opening happening, some of us couldn't believe it was happening. It sets the tone for the whole movie and makes us wonder if they open like this, then wheres the ride going from here? Well my friend put your belt on nice and tight because this ride does not let up.We meet our main girl Sidney Prescott. We find out that her mother was killed just a year before. The man who did it in jail. When Ghostface puts his sights on her she is quick to learn that running out the front door doesn't always work. On top of this Sidney has to put up news reporter Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox.) Who wrote the book about the murder of Sidney's mother. Gail seems to put Sidney though more hell than Ghostface, but she well get whats coming to her. Sidney's boyfriend Billy don't really seem to understand her drama filled life to make matters worse. Of course we also have the hot blonde played by Rose Mcgowan, your film geek played by Jamie Kennedy, and you stupid cop played by David Arquette. Only they are all very real in depth people. Scream puts every horror rule ever made in your face and then breaks them. It's a tongue and cheek horror film with some laughs but a hell of lot more scary's and blood. The most clearly written teen horror, its packed with lots of turns and drama. Wes Craven is a great story teller with how he tells the camera move, It is so slow well pasted that its very creepy. You just sit back and watch it unfold. There is lots of conversations that just make your blood flow cold, Wes makes this very intense by his use of close ups on the speakers face I found myself holding my breath at times. The last 20 minutes of this movie is filled with great surprise. You wont see any of this coming I promise you that.Scream is a very important film to horror, and the history of horror, and it is one of my favourite films. It paved the way for so many. If you have not seen this film you really should. It well not let you down.

The plot violates more laws of physics -- and common sense -- than I have time to explain.The real problem with the film -- other than that Stephen Boyd wasn't much of an actor, and Ms Welch's thespic skills were -- uh -- vanishingly small -- was Richard Fleischer's direction. Fleischer was never anyone's idea of a top director, but someone must have thought that as he'd helmed another submarine epic (20,000 Leagues Under the Sea) he'd be a good bet for this one. Alas, the reason for the Disney film's success was a great script and an excellent cast. Fleischer's inability to inject any real tension or excitement into Voyage is apparent. He rarely gets the characters beyond standing on their marks and delivering their lines.The highly lauded special effects are poor, especially the traveling mattes. When the crew returns to full size at the end, the matting is plainly visible and unstable -- and downright embarrassing. (Yes, that's how I reacted 47 years ago.)If you can find the April, 1967 issue of Mad (#110), you can have a lot more fun with their parody, some of Siegel\/Drucker's best work. An ad executive has a bad case of sinusitis, which needs treating from within. The crew is sent to LS\/MFT (Laboratory Sector for Making Folks Tiny) for miniaturization (which lasts only 60 seconds, of course). As the sub shrinks, it goes from Super Economy Size to Giant Economy Size to Large Economy Size. When Raquel Welsh wonders why the the antibodies are attacking Stephen Boyd and not her, he says My body they're anti -- your body they like! And so on.Fantastic Voyage is a disappointment on every count. Though it was intended to inspire a sense of awe and wonder, the fact that virtually everything looks like a set or a special effect pretty much kills that.

I have a bit of a sadistic streak when it comes to movies because I really like films that are more realistic in the execution and their endings. In regards to the familiar plot of boy meets girl, boy looses girl, boy gets girl back again, I have hardly seen it, and when I have, the relationship has not lasted. Then there is the girl that hates the guy and finally falls for him at the end, and though I have seen that happen, it has never happened to me.Five guys go on a trip to Las Vegas for a bachelor party and during the events where they take almost every drug available, one of them accidentally kills the prostitute while having sex with her in the bathroom. This is when the problems happen because they all freak out, except for one who says that the best thing to do is to take her out into the desert and bury her because they cannot get the police involved. Unfortunately things go from bad to worse when a security guard walks in and finds the body, and they deal with it by killing him as well. This guy (Christian Slater) quickly takes control of the situation, and very quickly the other four find that things have gone out of their control. Through Slater's act of killing the guard, they are all implicated.Things have worked out very well though as they successfully hid the corpses in the desert and all returned to Los Angeles none the worse. Unfortunately guilt begins to gnaw away at one of the men and he begins to have anxiety attacks. In dealing with this at the mock wedding, he is accidentally killed by his brother. When the guys wife stumbles on the truth, Slater once again takes control of the situation in a way that the others do not want done.The theme of this movie is how things go from bad to worse, and through a small incident, the lives of these men are destroyed. They constantly try to rise above the situation but it continues to dominate them and things continually get worse. The children are given to the guy and his fiancé in the will, and things seem to work better, only to discover that the life insurance policy has expired and the price of their house has dropped substantially, leaving them with two children, one of them physically handicapped, and very little money to look after them.As I said before, this is a black comedy (though Man Bites Dog is still the blackest comedy that I have ever seen) and we attempt to laugh at the misfortunes of others. We want to laugh because what we see in this movie is so disturbing that we want to put it at the back of our minds and forget that such a thing has ever happened. Unfortunately, like the movie, we simply cannot do that because our past always continues to rise up and haunt us. In one way it is one of the guys freaking out, then it is a curious wife, and a brother who has overcome with depression because he has killed his elder brother.Nothing good comes out of what happens and I guess this in a way really mimics life. What we are laughing at in Very Bad Things is life itself because what we are confronted with is something that could happen to us. Slater plays the level headed one, but unfortunately, his solutions end up causing more problems that they solved. In the end he must also face not only the consequences of his actions, but he must also face he greed.All of the characters have a tragic flaw in them. The younger brother's lust, and anger finally undoes him as he accidentally kills the prostitute and then his brother. The elder brother simply cannot remain calm, and it is this liability to panic that brings about his death. The fiancé simply cannot say no, and lets his fiancé come wife, dominate him, as well as Slater. He is able to say no to the prostitute, but she is not applying pressure to him. As soon as he says no, she leaves, but his wife and Slater will not let him say no. Slater is a very intelligent and dominant man, but he falls apart when he steps on the wrong toes. He believes that there is nothing that he can do, but unfortunately when he gets inbetween the fiancees, he discovers that when you annoy the wrong person too much, they lash out.Nobody redeems themselves in this movie, and those that did not do wrong, are brought apart by other's wrongs.

It draws deep characters for each role which seem to take advantage of each cast members skills. It also is a the ultimate triumph over despair. Bob Gunton gets kudos from here for his role as the warden.When your looking for a movie to watch, there are few to beat this picture as this one just turned out perfect. If every film were this well done, they would all be best pictures.

This movie is not his original though, rather it is based upon a movie made in 1960 and a book by John Wyndym, who also wrote Day of the Triffids. My friend described this movie as a B-grade horror movie and I am sort of inclined to agree with him except that there is a little more to it than simply nasty monsters.One Saturday afternoon, the entire village of Midwich falls asleep. The doctor (Christopher Reeve) is out of town and when he returns he finds that the FBI, state police, and army stand at the road leading in. They are all mystified as to why everybody fell asleep. Later they all wake up (and a graphic scene of a man having been cooked when he fell asleep on a barbecue is shown) and soon it is discovered that all of the women in the town are pregnant. Nine months later about nine children are born, four females and five males. One of the babies is still-born and quickly taken away by the FBI scientist (Kirsty Alley). These children grow up to become very intelligent and possessive of psionic abilities, and they begin to take control of the town.The nature of the children need be examined before the entirety of the film is looked at. These children are albino and travel in male\/female pairs, all except one whose female partner died in childbirth. These children have no emotion and consider themselves to be the superior to the human race. Where they come from it not clearly explained, but that is the nature of horror movies, there is no need for explanation.The single child, David, is one of the keys to the movie. As he does not have a partner, he begins to evolve differently to the children. He begins to understand pain due to the emptiness that the absence of his partner causes. He is torn between looking for a place within the children and without. His desire to belong and his loyalty to the other children cause a conflict within. The leader of the children is a female, and this is possibly a symbol of the nature of the children. They are opposed to everything that humanity stands for. They view humanity as an enemy and thus a female, generally considered the submissive sex, rises to become the leader of the children to challenge this aspect of humanity.There are two basic fears within this movie the fear that there exists a race that is supremely more powerful than humanity, and the parental fear that their children will rise to take their place. One of the major themes is that the children are superior to humanity. They exist to replace humanity and to destroy them. This is a basic fear as humans generally want to be the dominant. The problem is that we are not. Our fear of an extra-powerful entity is justified with the existence of God. People deal with this by making God their ally in everything they do. God is somebody, to most people, that lives with humans and demands nothing. This is not true for God demands obedience and we refuse to give it. Because we refuse to acknowledge him he will destroy us, and because of this we should respect who he is.The second fear, that of parents towards the children, is also a justified one. At one stage a parent will have many expectations of the child, but as the child grows and begins to become independent, this changes. There is generally a struggle between the child and the parent with the child wanting to go his or her own way while the parent wanting his\/her will for the child. This movie manifests the ultimate fear that the child is superior to the parent and also uncontrollable. It is not the parent who controls the child but the child who controls the parent. Not only are the children in control of their parents but they also have the power of life and death over the parents, as is revealed quite quickly in the movie.I enjoyed Village of the Damned. It was not a movie that stands above other movies, but it is one in which there is some thought. The horror in this movie is more subtle than a lot of other movies, the horror being more social than spiritual.

Do not read any more as what I write will give away too much of the plot.My friend's comment about this movie was that when he saw it in the cinema, at the end everybody left in dead silence. The ending of it so shocked them that there was literally nothing to say. The Usual Suspects is a movie with a brilliant twist and flows constantly through to the end. On TV it sucks because you simply lose the flow of the movie as the adds interrupt it.It is impossible to describe the plot without giving too much away, so I will simply say what happens at the beginning and a few other things about the themes in the movie. It is not a thematically deep movie, but it is one that the characters work well and the plot is very well constructed.It begins with an explosion on the LA waterfront and lots of corpses are dragged out of the water. One man, a cripple, is found alive and is taken in for questioning, but he has to be released due to some immunity he has. Anyway, the story is told through the mouth of this cripple, and seems legit.It begins with the hijacking of a truck in Queens and five people - the usual suspects, are brought in for questioning. Of course they have nothing on them and their lawyer forces the police to release them. Angered at the police's treatment of them, they decide to bust open a conspiracy where the police offer taxi services to criminals.One of the lines in this movie shows the idea that once somebody is a criminal, they are always a criminal. It is the line that says, you get to a point where you no longer have any rights - no matter how you try to live a straight life, they will always come after you to pin something on you. This is the story of Dean Keaton. He was a cop who went corrupt but now is trying to make good with his life. Unfortunately the cops won't let him do that. Not only will the police not leave him alone, but when he tries to make good, his past always comes back.The police believe that Keaton is not just a bad guy, but the bad guy. They are so obsessed with making sure that Keaton is dead that they completely miss the real person whom they are looking for and this person simply walks right out from under their noses while they try to force them to admit that it was all Keaton's fault.Another theme is that we are never truly free - there is always somebody that is in control, and not only that but what ever we do always affects somebody, and in some cases somebody whom we don't even realise. All of the suspects in the movie did something that upset the wrong person, and they did not even intend on upsetting him, they simply did not think about their actions.Finally there is a somewhat relative message in this movie. On one hand, things are not always what they seem, but on the other side, the truth is really only somebody's subjective interpretation of events. Even then, we can generally not accept what people say because there is always a subjective intention behind it.The Usual Suspects is a brilliant movie.

Among other things, one remembers The Godfather's tremendous narrative drive and the dominating presence of Marlon Brando in the title role, which, though not large, unified the film and transformed a super-gangster movie into a unique family chronicle.Part II, also written by Mr. Coppola and Mario Puzo, is not a sequel in any engaging way. It's not really much of anything that can be easily defined.It's a second movie made largely out of the bits and pieces of Mr. Puzo's novel that didn't fit into the first. It's a Frankenstein's monster stitched together from leftover parts. It talks. It moves in fits and starts but it has no mind of its own. Occasionally it repeats a point made in The Godfather (organized crime is just another kind of American business, say) but its insights are fairly lame at this point.The Godfather, Part II, which opened yesterday at five theaters, is not very far along before one realizes that it hasn't anything more to say. Everything of any interest was thoroughly covered in the original film, but like many people who have nothing to say, Part II won't shut up.Not the least of its problems is its fractured form. Part II moves continually back and forth in time between two distinct narratives. It's the story of the young Vito Corleone (who grew up to be played by Marlon Brando in the first movie) seen first around the turn of the century in Sicily and then in 1917 in New York, where he's played by Robert De Niro, and it's the story of Vito's son, Michael, played again by Al Pacino, the new Mafia don who sets out to control Las Vegas in the late nineteen-fifties.One story doesn't necessarily illuminate the other, it's just additional data, like footnotes. I can't readily imagine what Mr. Coppola and Mr. Puzo were trying to do, except to turn their first film into a long parenthesis that would fit between the halves of the new movie.Even if Part II were a lot more cohesive, revealing and exciting than it is, it probably would have run the risk of appearing to be the self- parody it now seems.Looking very expensive but spiritually desperate, Part II has the air of a very long, very elaborate revue sketch. Nothing is sacred. The photography by Gordon Willis, so effective originally, is now comically fancy&#x97;the exteriors are too bright and glow while the interiors are so dark you wonder if these Mafia chiefs can't afford to buy bigger light bulbs.Nino Rota's old score keeps thumping away like a heavenly juke box. The performers, especially those repeating their original roles, seem locked into waxy rigid attitudes. Mr. Pacino, so fine the first time out, goes through the film looking glum, sighing wearily as he orders the execution of an old associate or a brother, winding up very lonely and powerful, which is just about the way he wound up before. Mr. De Niro, one of our best young actors, is interesting as the young Vito until, toward the end of his section of the film, he starts giving a nightclub imitation of Mr. Brando's elderly Vito.There are a couple of notable exceptions. Lee Strasberg, the head of the Actors Studio, makes an extraordinarily effective screen debut as Hyman Roth, the powerful Jewish mobster (reportedly modeled on Meyer Lansky) with whom Michael attempts to take over the Havana rackets under the Battista regime.

Among other things, one remembers The Godfather's tremendous narrative drive and the dominating presence of Marlon Brando in the title role, which, though not large, unified the film and transformed a super-gangster movie into a unique family chronicle.Part II, also written by Mr. Coppola and Mario Puzo, is not a sequel in any engaging way. It's not really much of anything that can be easily defined.It's a second movie made largely out of the bits and pieces of Mr. Puzo's novel that didn't fit into the first. It's a Frankenstein's monster stitched together from leftover parts. It talks. It moves in fits and starts but it has no mind of its own. Occasionally it repeats a point made in The Godfather (organized crime is just another kind of American business, say) but its insights are fairly lame at this point.The Godfather, Part II, which opened yesterday at five theaters, is not very far along before one realizes that it hasn't anything more to say. Everything of any interest was thoroughly covered in the original film, but like many people who have nothing to say, Part II won't shut up.Not the least of its problems is its fractured form. Part II moves continually back and forth in time between two distinct narratives. It's the story of the young Vito Corleone (who grew up to be played by Marlon Brando in the first movie) seen first around the turn of the century in Sicily and then in 1917 in New York, where he's played by Robert De Niro, and it's the story of Vito's son, Michael, played again by Al Pacino, the new Mafia don who sets out to control Las Vegas in the late nineteen-fifties.One story doesn't necessarily illuminate the other, it's just additional data, like footnotes. I can't readily imagine what Mr. Coppola and Mr. Puzo were trying to do, except to turn their first film into a long parenthesis that would fit between the halves of the new movie.Even if Part II were a lot more cohesive, revealing and exciting than it is, it probably would have run the risk of appearing to be the self- parody it now seems.Looking very expensive but spiritually desperate, Part II has the air of a very long, very elaborate revue sketch. Nothing is sacred. The photography by Gordon Willis, so effective originally, is now comically fancy&#x97;the exteriors are too bright and glow while the interiors are so dark you wonder if these Mafia chiefs can't afford to buy bigger light bulbs.Nino Rota's old score keeps thumping away like a heavenly juke box. The performers, especially those repeating their original roles, seem locked into waxy rigid attitudes. Mr. Pacino, so fine the first time out, goes through the film looking glum, sighing wearily as he orders the execution of an old associate or a brother, winding up very lonely and powerful, which is just about the way he wound up before. Mr. De Niro, one of our best young actors, is interesting as the young Vito until, toward the end of his section of the film, he starts giving a nightclub imitation of Mr. Brando's elderly Vito.There are a couple of notable exceptions. Lee Strasberg, the head of the Actors Studio, makes an extraordinarily effective screen debut as Hyman Roth, the powerful Jewish mobster (reportedly modeled on Meyer Lansky) with whom Michael attempts to take over the Havana rackets under the Battista regime.

The story line follows the book and yet, it has a happier ending then that one. It's not a real spoiler because if you haven't seen this one, you might have never seen this, go out and watch it now. It's a big classic.The characters are rather filled out, the personalities fleshed out down to little details. It's nice to get back to the classics. Aladdin is the normal Robin Hood character; he almost always looks after people who can't really fend for themselves even if he would go home hungry. Although he's a street rat, he dreams of being part of the world of aristocrats, not starving and able to relax. He is the opposite of Jasmine, who is only trying to get away from it all and be free. Both feel trapped in their own world. I guess in a sense, the Genie is also trapped, so it makes them all more believable. They feel each other's pains and problems.Jafar is one of the best Disney villains I think. He does all the right moves and yet, sometimes, it seems like he uses Iago a little too much for his ideas.Some little things are not bothersome in the artwork, when Rasha bights the prince, he has a piece of his boxers even though they are intact when he storms away. Its little things like that that makes it not as good as it could be but when it was drawn on cells, it is easy to excuse them. When they bring in the CG though, it looks rather bad though there aren't many times they use it.I like some of the voices, Genie's the most though. It's so fun and comical that even at the most drama filled times, he loosens it up. I'm not sure about the music though, it just feels so childish.

There isn't really much of a theme with it, and it really only continues the trend set out in Under Siege I. Steven Segal is a Navy Seal commander who has retired and is now a cook. His brother has recently died and he meets his niece at the railway station to go to Los Angeles for the funeral. The train is the target of hijackers who use the train as a mobile base to control a top secret satellite. They request a billion dollars off of America's enemies to use this satellite to cause an earthquake in Washington DC and eliminate the entire eastern seaboard.The only thing that stands up in this movie is that it is purely an action movie. There are lots of hair raising stunts, bodies thumping down cliff faces, and tonnes of machine-gun fire. There is a nasty woman assassin (for some reason the women assassins seem to be the most deadliest), and lots of mooks that get shot. There is also a knife fight at the end between Segal and the mercenary boss. Unfortunately this knife fight is really bad, and does not equate to the one at the end of Under Siege. The woman also appears very irregularly and this is not as fiercesome as could be expected.One of the things about this movie is how the ultimate weapons are not always that ultimate. The theme in these two movies is how the US's biggest weapons are stolen and used against them. The Missouri in Under Siege was not exactly a new weapon, but the satellite here is. What is strange is out of all of the trains, why this one? Well, when I think about it, I realise that most importantly Steven Segal is on this train. If he wasn't then there wouldn't be a good guy to stop them. Less importantly, the train goes near a dead zone, a place where no radio signals can get out. This is not all that important because when they enter this zone it is only to crash the train into another oncoming train.This movie is okay really for a pointless action movie, and there is action aplenty. In the end though, it does not rise above the level of being simply okay. ","genre":null},{"date":"27 December 2013","score":"","review":" There is not much that I can really say about this movie.

While it's somewhat better than 'Cinderella,' 'Dumbo' and probably 'Sleeping Beauty,' it's not quite as good as the other films I mentioned due to its sluggish pace throughout but it has a lot of moments that made me laugh, some memorable scenes and some catchy music.Besides the pace, the drawbacks include Pinocchio's mouth not moving when he talks once or twice, the cats Figaro (quadrupedal) and Gideon (bipedal) not talking if Honest John can (it would probably have made sense if all these animals could speak), some loose ends and the song 'Little Wooden Head' seeming to be incomplete because the version on the UK VHS of 'Sing- Along-Songs Colours of the Wind' had additional lyrics but it's a chirpy song nonetheless. While 'Give a Little Whistle,' 'Hi-Diddle-Dee-Dee,' and 'I've Got No Strings' are all cheerful, the brief ending version of 'When You Wish Upon A Star' made me a little teary- eyed ('Baby Mine' from 'Dumbo' made me cry even more) but the opening version strangely didn't make me cry and I found it beautiful - I also liked how it became Disney's signature tune in various arrangements when accompanying several different logos, including the more recent river and Disney castle opening logo. The incidental music has a melodic, nostalgic feel to it and I liked how some of it matched the tunes of some of the songs and the character animation. Moving on to the animation it was smooth for the most part and the backgrounds were intricately drawn. The Blue Fairy in particular was gorgeously animated and I liked her pretty glittery effect. She reminded me of typical 'Glamour Girls' from the 1940s. All of Gepetto's clocks were imaginative if the animation on them was jerky - the ones with the ducks and the drunken man made my mum and I giggle but she found the one with the woman smacking her child's bottom for being naughty with paint politically incorrect because corporal punishment again children is frowned upon these days as is childhood smoking since these things were more appropriate in bygone days. This film had more of an emotional impact on me when I was little because not only did 'When You Wish Upon a Star' make me cry but also the Blue Fairy turning Pinocchio into a real boy. That part just makes me smile these days. There are also some very dark moments in the film such as Stromboli locking Pinocchio in a birdcage, the naughty boys on Pleasure Island turning into donkeys and the climax with Monstro the whale. The underwater scene leading up to this is just as beautiful as the Blue Fairy and is vibrantly coloured.Overall this Disney film is an enchanting watch that has some funny moments, stunning animation and memorable songs in spite of its pace dragging on throughout. 9\/10.

Have you ever been stuck in an elevator? Well you'll feel the fear 1000x times more when watching this movie. The opening sequence of the movie makes it look like a bad horror film at first, but Cube has so much more to offer.One of the best things with this movie were the actors, they were all really good. I almost felt like they were playing themselves which I rarely feel while watching movies. The plot is simple, seven strangers wake up in an endless maze with death traps. But what Vincenzo Natali focuses on is how the different characters change during this time. That is what kept me worried, excited and scared all the time.Few low budget movies can build so much excitement as Cube did, and that's why I really liked it. I haven't seen the two sequels yet but you can't make sequels to movies like these. I'm happy with the first one and I think you should watch it. But as I said, the actors are really what makes this movie so good, I'm pretty sure that if there would be a known cast it would have been a lot worse. If you want an exciting adventure, then watch Cube. This is true cult.
