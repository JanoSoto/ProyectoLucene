The very essence of what a robot is for most people comes from the Terminator movies. Arnie Burger career was made the original movie and even when he is 92 and using a walker he will still be the Terminator (maybe the zimmnator).T1 (as it will be referred from now on in this treatise) defined a robot as an unstoppable machine that will do whatever it can to carry out its mission. It has no soul, no compassion and will not stop, until you are dead.T2 brings 2 terminators back through time. One is a copy of the terminator from the original movie and the other is ultra high tech liquid metal robot. The special effects don't date because they are simply used cleverly. Note Terminator 3 is not a movie about Robots, it is a movie about time travel. It has nothing to say about machines, only fate. This time the machines are trying to kill John Conner himself when he was a young child. Too bad Sarah can't protect him, he is in a mental institution. So the big guy (Arnie Burger) back through time to become the governor of California and then the president of the united states. Their plan is to ban junk food in schools to weekend the resolve of their enemies. (oh wait, that is the plot of Terminator 4). No, wait. John (the future John) sends Arnie to save John and battle the other Termintor. The Terminator must also learn and live within the rules of society (the machines are our servants, the destroy us because we programmed in our fears, not our hopes and dreams. It is on our own orders that they seek to kill us).Why do I think this movie is so perfect. One, it is intelligent without pretense. It assumes the audience needs help and explains things, but doesn't just use dialog as a way to fill in between action sequences. The hydrogen bomb sequences are fabled for their accuracy. Plot points that don't need to be there are not there. By leaving the question blank of how the invention of a tool for peace (a neural net chip) get turned into the destruction of humanity, you can fill in the blanks. Time travel or how the new Terminator make it back through time are not explained. This is a movie about robots, time travel is a plot device (I hate most time travel stories and myself, along with other people who feel the same, still love Terminator). You also have the nuclear family represented. The terminator drives while blasting away with the shotgun. Sarah pops off a few rounds with a hand gun, and John reloads. The action sequences are American action, none of these endless Hong Kong action clones (I love Hong Kong action, but there are other ways). There are lots of very big guns, explosions and witty lines. There is no post modern self-referential $%#$%#. It was funny in Scream and Spaceballs (we can find out where they went by watching the movie we are in on video), but I am over it now OK. It also sums up the most important American fears and hopes. Hope for a future, fear of our desire to destroy, fear of authority, belief that we know the problems and the answers to the worlds problems but no one will listen to us, the family, technology is both good and bad and of course big guns are really cool.James Cameron ability in film making is superb, and part of the great tradition of American film making where the art of film making is hidden so that we can enjoy the story more. Terminator is perhaps the last American movie ever made (now most movies have an international feel using techniques found all around the world, which I love too).

But I just watched it on HBO tonight and have to say it is one of the most unrealistic sub movies I've ever seen. I was in the silent service and qualified in submarines. Of course a lot of what I'll write would not bother the casual viewer, but the discrepancies, details and plot were just too much to overlook. To start with, Gene Hackman's dog coming underway with him is a load of Huey and really made me look down on this picture from the beginning. The Chief of Naval Operations himself would not or could not bring a pet on a ship with him. They threw in a few catchy phrases and buzz words but for the most part the terminology used in the control room was made up. Even for an Ohio class boat the set for the movie's submarine was entirely too spacious. The crawl spaces the XO used to sneak into the control room was ludicrous. Submarines do not have anything like that. They are tightly packed with equipment and machinery and simply do not have that kind of space.I still don't understand how the reactor was scrammed and lost propulsion from the torpedo that hit in the stern and caused all that flooding. If anything was damaged that badly, it's not getting fixed at sea. This isn't Star Trek. The radio scenario was absolute rubbish as well. There are so many redundant comms systems on board and inside the radio shack, no way would one receiver getting fried completely isolate the ship from command authority. The EAMs might have looked good on the screen but the real deal and Sealed Authentication System is so much more complicated, it's not even funny. There is literally dozens of yellow pages thick manuals covering nuclear command and control systems, and without going into classified details, I cannot believe something like this could ever happen on board a US submarine.There is no way people would be aiming guns around like they were in the movie either. On a real submarine which is packed with 3000 pound hydraulics and high pressure air systems, 1 bullet could kill everyone in a compartment in which it was discharged. The beginning of the movie with the fire in the galley was a load too. Fires are the biggest threat to ships safety and if they had a fire in real life, the CO would immediately surface the ship to fight it. A fire in such an enclosed space, would make so much smoke, within minutes you couldn't see your hand in front of your face, and the ship would have to emergency ventilate. Let alone the nonchalant way they dealt with that one guy dying. And of course no real submarine CO would run a drill 2 minutes after securing from a real fire. If someone was killed in a casualty, the CO would be sweating bullets.Tony Soprano making that fat dude drop and do push ups on the bus. Talk about unprofessional. People have an unrealistic view of military discipline. That may happen in boot camp but not in the real fleet. Also that COB was unbelievably fat. No he wouldn't fit on a submarine and they don't even let people that big in the military. Also, these SSBN's are on tightly regimented patrol cycles, with 2 crews. There are always some on patrol in alert status. The XO and weps wouldn't get paged to get underway. If they were on their off-crew period, the other crew, blue or gold would have the ship and it would already be at sea. If something goes down, you need subs ready to launch already, you may not have the luxury of even the time it took the Alabama to get underway.The entire crew wears puppy suits, underway, officers included. Also you don't salute underway. If the captain walks by you acknowledge him but don't salute. The movie really made enlisted people look dumb imo. They are the experts on the ship's systems. And officers usually are the ones asking the dumb questions. The fight in the crew's mess over the silver surfer was a huge stretch. They give psych tests and such to submariners, one of the main goals to weed out people who can't handle stress and are hot heads. Not to say people wouldn't argue but if they were throwing punches, they'd have both been written up and in deep ****.And the last thing was the ending. If anything remotely happened like this in real life, you can bet the Commanding Officer who held a loaded gun to an innocents head would be court marshaled and sent to prison. Not just allowed to quietly retire. Also no CO has the pull to just get their XO a command. Less than half of XOs even make the cut and get command. You have to be the creme de la creme to get command of a nuclear submarine and follow a strict career outline. It was an enjoyable movie. But I've read some of the threads about, who's side would you be on, Hackman's or Washington's, and really the whole scenario is just beyond anything that is remotely reasonable! This movie was the Deep Impact of sub flicks. Might as well have said Alabama was going to drill through the bottom of the ocean floor and disturb the earth's core to cause a magnetic flux that would stop the Russian missiles from launching. LOL Bottom line, its a decent flick, but don't think it is even close to accurate or realistic.

To start with, Gene Hackman's dog coming underway with him is a load of Huey and really made me look down on this picture from the beginning. The Chief of Naval Operations himself would not or could not bring a pet on a ship with him. They threw in a few catchy phrases and buzz words but for the most part the terminology used in the control room was made up. Even for an Ohio class boat the set for the movie's submarine was entirely too spacious. The crawl spaces the XO used to sneak into the control room was ludicrous. Submarines do not have anything like that. They are tightly packed with equipment and machinery and simply do not have that kind of space.I still don't understand how the reactor was scrammed and lost propulsion from the torpedo that hit in the stern and caused all that flooding. If anything was damaged that badly, it's not getting fixed at sea. This isn't Star Trek. The radio scenario was absolute rubbish as well. There are so many redundant comms systems on board and inside the radio shack, no way would one receiver getting fried completely isolate the ship from command authority. The EAMs might have looked good on the screen but the real deal and Sealed Authentication System is so much more complicated, it's not even funny. There is literally dozens of yellow pages thick manuals covering nuclear command and control systems, and without going into classified details, I cannot believe something like this could ever happen on board a US submarine.There is no way people would be aiming guns around like they were in the movie either. On a real submarine which is packed with 3000 pound hydraulics and high pressure air systems, 1 bullet could kill everyone in a compartment in which it was discharged. The beginning of the movie with the fire in the galley was a load too. Fires are the biggest threat to ships safety and if they had a fire in real life, the CO would immediately surface the ship to fight it. A fire in such an enclosed space, would make so much smoke, within minutes you couldn't see your hand in front of your face, and the ship would have to emergency ventilate. Let alone the nonchalant way they dealt with that one guy dying. And of course no real submarine CO would run a drill 2 minutes after securing from a real fire. If someone was killed in a casualty, the CO would be sweating bullets.Tony Soprano making that fat dude drop and do push ups on the bus. Talk about unprofessional. People have an unrealistic view of military discipline. That may happen in boot camp but not in the real fleet. Also that COB was unbelievably fat. No he wouldn't fit on a submarine and they don't even let people that big in the military. Also, these SSBN's are on tightly regimented patrol cycles, with 2 crews. There are always some on patrol in alert status. The XO and weps wouldn't get paged to get underway. If they were on their off-crew period, the other crew, blue or gold would have the ship and it would already be at sea. If something goes down, you need subs ready to launch already, you may not have the luxury of even the time it took the Alabama to get underway.The entire crew wears puppy suits, underway, officers included. Also you don't salute underway. If the captain walks by you acknowledge him but don't salute. The movie really made enlisted people look dumb imo. They are the experts on the ship's systems. And officers usually are the ones asking the dumb questions. The fight in the crew's mess over the silver surfer was a huge stretch. They give psych tests and such to submariners, one of the main goals to weed out people who can't handle stress and are hot heads. Not to say people wouldn't argue but if they were throwing punches, they'd have both been written up and in deep ****.And the last thing was the ending. If anything remotely happened like this in real life, you can bet the Commanding Officer who held a loaded gun to an innocents head would be court marshaled and sent to prison. Not just allowed to quietly retire. Also no CO has the pull to just get their XO a command. Less than half of XOs even make the cut and get command. You have to be the creme de la creme to get command of a nuclear submarine and follow a strict career outline. It was an enjoyable movie. But I've read some of the threads about, who's side would you be on, Hackman's or Washington's, and really the whole scenario is just beyond anything that is remotely reasonable! This movie was the Deep Impact of sub flicks. Might as well have said Alabama was going to drill through the bottom of the ocean floor and disturb the earth's core to cause a magnetic flux that would stop the Russian missiles from launching. LOL Bottom line, its a decent flick, but don't think it is even close to accurate or realistic.

Sometimes it's chocolate and other times it's fruit. Rarely do I eat oranges because I hate the sticky juice on my fingers. And that is what this film is. Sticky juice that you want to wash off right away.Not for many a year have I seen such a terrible film except for the nonsense of Beligni's La Bella e Vita.I curse myself for wasting minutes of my 'life time' in watching this totally useless film. How it was given an Oscar nomination I shall never know. The implausible story aside, the filming techniques were an utter disgrace. Hand cam is not the right word. It seems like it was filmed by someone with a serious neurological disease. Panning, close focus, long shots etc were thrown out of the window and substituted with a manic frenzy of out of focus close ups and wavering mid shots. And as to the scene cuts? I can only assume that all members of the crew were given a pair of scissors. If not I can only assume they had a break for drinks every three minutes. Compare this film with The Return I you will know what I mean. Listen folks, if the story is good, let it speak for itself. No amount of trickery will make a bad plot into a good one. If you want to know the secret of filming watch Paper Moon. Better still watch real life. How often do you walk around in circles while having a normal conversation.And then there's the lighting. I don't think the subdued lighting shots were intentional. I guess they needed the candles for the dinner table scene. As for 'contre jour'. The words and method escaped them I think. Clichés. This film has so many you could release a second copy DVD showing them all. How many more films will I have to see without wanting to scream as the camera pans\/jolts upwards to reveal a Gestapo flag? In this film they spared no measure. They did it three times! It was good to see that they used a Jack Russel terrier as a continuity link for the street scene. Something must have happened though because when it was having to do some night time barking it changed into a rotweiller. How odd?I was very impressed with the sole German soldier who was on duty in the street. Obviously the budget couldn't go beyond a Jack Russel, its food and one member of the Wehrmacht. As to the acting. If it hadn't been for the main character it would have died a death in the first ten minutes. Hold on! It did. This film wasn't satire nor was it dark humour. It was farce with a badly written story line, appalling filming and casting. It is on the same level as Benigni's La Bella e Vita. Which is to say - banal. Finally. Remind me never to watch another film with Janslav Du&#154;ek, In his character role he would, as a collaborator, have been shot by the resistance. As it is, he can take part responsibility for the film being peppered with holes from start to finish. If you are going to film a subject which directly or indirectly relates to the extermination of 6 million people then do it with taste and elan.Would someone please inform the director as to what real satire is as opposed to Benny Hill\/Mr. Bean comedy. For example Apocolypse Now or Dr. StrangeloveIt fully deserves a minus 100 rating. It would have been given a minus 1000 but some credit needs to be given to the dog.

Burstyn is strong as Chris, trying to juggle being a single, famous working mother and the attack of this evil force.

However, this is not to say the film loses its power. It is still frightening, with many moments which will haunt you, the floating, head-spinning, vomiting scenes, and of course, the spider-walk. It is true that now we can watch and understand it more effectively, whereas upon its release we may have been biased, or seen it purely because we had heard that it was evil.

And as documentaries, these are excellent tough cases, since one of the conceits of the genre is that most of the content is true.In a nutshell, I love Moore's film-making, but I strongly disagree with his politics. I also think that he has a tendency to manipulate his material to an extent that he loses credibility. He's a propagandist. But what a propagandist! As with all other films, I judge Moore's work solely on its success as an artwork. As an artist, Moore is nothing short of genius. He easily gets his strong statements across, often using extreme irony in a kind of filmic Gricean implicature. He's consistently humorous, even in the direst of circumstances. He has an incorrigible down-hominess in his appearance and delivery. He is a master craftsman, with an eye for just the right footage, whether new or stock, and an impeccable sense of timing.Despite all of those general assets, Roger & Me isn't Moore's best work. It has rough spots. But considering that this is the debut work from an innovative filmmaker basically forging a new subgenre--he has a completely unique approach to the documentary form--the rough spots are understandable.For me, Roger & Me is most fascinating when it examines two kinds of Flint Michigan citizens, contrasting them against each other so that it seems they're living on separate planets. On the one hand, we have average citizens trying to cope with the economic downturn however they can. The woman selling rabbits as Pets or Meat is a captivating subject who could have easily merited an entire film on her own. On the other hand, we have the ever-optimistic Flint politicians and economic developers, pumping money and enthusiasm into increasingly bizarre projects, ultimately geared towards promoting Flint as a tourist destination despite it's exorbitantly high crime rate and its status as the #1 worst place to live in America according to Money Magazine.Almost as entrancing are the celebrity contributions towards morale boosting. Their disposition is as transparent as the politicians', with plugs for their products and projects never far behind their feigned concern. However, Moore is just as intriguing to watch as he does what he does best on camera--make a pest out of himself. He continually pushes the boundaries, basically seeing how far he can go until he'd be arrested for trespassing or harassment. While some may be sympathetic to his political causes, it doesn't take much empathic ability to put oneself in the shoes of someone trying to work or enjoy leisure time, and instead being hassled by a frumpy-looking guy sticking a camera in their face and generally being belligerent. It's not that far removed from Howard Stern's approach to on-location celebrity interviews. Like Stern and crew, Moore is as fun to watch in this mode for making an ass out of himself as for showing ostensibly less-than-congenial or less-then-admirable sides to his subjects.As for politics, my point of view is much more similar to the Flint-area lobbyist Moore interviews. I disagree that companies owe their workers a living. One has to be resourceful and adaptable to survive. But as I mentioned, I do not subtract any points for not agreeing with a filmmaker's message or political view. Moore succeeds partially because he gets his message across so well, propaganda or not. On this end, he's brilliant when it comes to editing. He knows just what section of footage to use to make his subjects look as he wants them to look, and he's a master at juxtapositions that emphasize or undermine points as he requires. I believe that all documentarians and journalists do this, by the way, just not with the same amount of skill. Moore is admirable for making the technique less opaque. He doesn't seem to be pretending that he's objective.Roger & Me's rough spots are mostly technical. Some shots are blurry, some are not framed as effectively as they could be, and so forth. Occasionally, Moore lets a scene linger too long here, and the film doesn't always flow as well as it could. Maybe these points seem worse in light of his later work, which avoids all of these problems--he's learned and developed a lot as a filmmaker over the years.But this is crucial viewing for anyone interested in Moore's work, for anyone interested in documentaries in general, and especially for anyone sympathetic to Moore's brand of American Liberal politics.

Peter Mullan is instantly likable as Joe Kavanagh, a recovering alcoholic from Ruchill, a decaying suburb of Glasgow, who has a lot at stake. He has fallen in love with Sarah (Louis Goodall), a health worker, and wants to go straight but circumstances conspire against him. He is determined to help his friend Liam (David McKay) when he gets behind on his payments to a drug dealer but his options are limited and he is forced to make a choice that threatens the stability of his fragile relationship.Mullan won the Best Actor award at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival and it is fully deserved. We know that Joe's problems are overwhelming but we root for him to make it in spite of the odds because of his warmth and humor and generosity towards others. Joe has been sober for a year and attends sessions of Alcoholics Anonymous. He also coaches the local soccer team composed of unemployed workers who have won only one game the entire year. When he meets Sarah, a social worker for the Health Department who is visiting Liam and his wife Sabine (Anne-Marie Kennedy) and young child, things start to look up. We do not learn much about Sarah's past but it is obvious that the two have discovered each other at a crucial point in their life.In a powerful scene, Sarah asks Joe why he stopped drinking and he tells her how he had beaten a woman he was dating and has never forgiven himself. Both are very tentative about getting involved but they are also drawn to each other and can think about the future for the first time. Sadly, the world has other plans. Sabine is a heroin addict who used the drugs she was supposed to sell and is in serious debt to a local drug dealer McGowan (David Hayman), an old friend of Joe's. When the mobster boss demands that Liam cover his wife's debt or they will break his legs, Joe tries to moderate and ends up striking a deal with the mob, leading to a series of unfortunate events. In one of the most emotionally gripping scenes, Sarah berates Joe for lying to her and he responds Some of us don't have a choice. Some of us don't have a f***ing choice. The mean streets of Ruchill are strewn with the results of urban decay and Loach does not spare us the details. He even mocks the image of bonnie Scotland with a scene involving a kilt-clad bagpiper playing the same three songs over and over for a group of tourists. Combining gritty realism with humor, My Name is Joe has an outstanding script by Paul Laverty and fully dimensional characters that transcend clichés. Loach does not pass judgment on his characters or directly condemn society for their failings. It is a work of compassion and humanity.

All the years of viewing other films have only made me more and more appreciative of this movie's many strengths.On one level, I believe this is the best sports movie ever made. It is miles ahead of more realistic films like NORTH DALLAS FORTY or SEMI TOUGH or even critical favorites like COBB and EIGHT MEN OUT. The very fact that Rollerball is a make believe sport adds believability to the action sequences. Watch a baseball film and you can see at a glance that Robert Redford or Kevin Costner are not real athletes. But since rollerball has never been played, James Caan as Jonathan E really looks like the best in the game. There are no clichés like home runs or long passes to spoil the danger and excitement -- every crash and goal is new, never having been seen before. And there are no clichés about the fans, the athletes, or win one for the Gipper or gamblers or shady ladies trying to make Our Hero throw the game. From the beginning we sense the stakes are higher -- Jonathan E will either conform or die.That brings up the fact that ROLLERBALL also shares a central theme with a lot of other powerful movies, like FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, COOL HAND Luke, and even A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS. What happens when a uniquely gifted individual refuses to participate in a corrupt system? This movie is so powerful as a drama you hardly notice the sci fi trappings. The rugged action scenes are so real you hardly notice that rollerball is a make believe game.James Caan as Jonathan E turns in a sensitive, nuanced performance, deliberately underplaying the tough guy side as much as possible. Michael Beck as Moonpie is the foolishly overconfident one, playing Frank Sinatra's Maggio to Caan's Robert E. Lee Pruitt. But unlike the hard luck privates in this man's army, these rollerball stars get to have glamor, luxury, and unlimited sex between vicious games of rollerball.

The Godfather trilogy is a magnificent saga about the Corleone family and it's way to the top of the American mob.Afcourse and their way into the high society of admired people.But,behind this story lies one more story,as complex as the first,about higher values,family,love and respect.It is very interesting to see Vito Andolini's(Marlon Brando) way from his departure from Sicily,where he was on the run because local boss Don Cicci wanted to kill him because he thought that Vito is going to take revenge on him for killing his father and brother,to New York's ''Litlle Itally'' where he is living like a bum.Although Vito had a really small wage,he bought a pear every day and brought it to his wife to show his love,respect and gratitude.Later,Vito became a very wise man and the king of the Mafia. God never gives without taking.Don Vito in one of his wars with the other families lost his oldest son,Sonny(James Caan).So, today we all know a old Mafia sayingFor revenge always kill the brother. It means that you never kill the man that brought you harm,but you should kill someone that is closest to his heart.It will hurt more.On this way Vito's youngest son (Al Pacino) and his ''grandson'' (Andy Garcia) will lose their wives.And there is one more thing that the movie shows the best.What money can do to a man!When their parents die Michael kills Fredo because he let him down.Horrible,but logic.The movie is filled with great actors.James Caan is a real hot-head,old school wise guy.Al Pacino is also great as a man that doesn't want to meddle into family business but then becomes a killer.MARLON BRANDO is.... i really can't find the word to describe it.He made the most known role in the world as the rightful Don.Marlon magnificently paint a portrait of a man who doesn't forget the friendship shown to him and is willing to help anybody that respects him.If somebody shows hate to the Don,he makes him an offer he can't refuse and deals with him quickly.The words that illustrate how much is Brando a good actor,are the words that Nicholson spoke on Brando's funeral''Now,when Marlon is gone,all we actors will rise a few steps above''.A unmissable classic ","genre":null},{"date":"14 March 2005","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I don't know why,but since i know about myself i loved mob movies.There is something interesting in the way of a mafioso to the top,and his fall.So it is not a miracle,that The Godfather trilogy is my favourite movie.

However, I find it somewhat hard to believe that Phillip Morgan could divulge the truth so quickly. Having a party without removing the body from the crime scene also seems incredibly stupid, but at least the murderers could have temporarily put the body in a place it wouldn't be discovered. The chest was known for keeping the books that one of the party guests came specifically to look at. The entire movie takes place in 1 location in 1 evening which isn't necessarily a bad thing. However, I would have found the movie much more believable if it occurred over several days and the murderers left more clues. Talking about murdering people when just about everybody at the party is worried why one of the characters, David, hasn't shown up just seems too easy for Jimmy Stewart to pick up on. Also, I think it would be much better if more was made of Stewart being given the victim's hat accidentally when he leaves the party. It doesn't make sense to me that he remains silent when everybody is still at the party and worried about where David is. It also was risky for him to come back alone when the party is over.There's also one scene that I'm not sure was intentionally funny. Jimmy Stewart returns to the party claiming he forgot his cigarette case and there's this silly conversation about his character having another drink. Finally, Philip blurts out, He said you can have another drink!! Philip's character was almost campy as he frequently overplayed his lines.Lastly, I think the film would have been much more intriguing and memorable if Stewart's character is never quite sure if Brandon and Phillip are guilty of anything. The movie American Psycho with Christian Bale played on this theme and I was very impressed with that movie. Even when Bale's character tells his friends he's psychotic, they laugh and brush him off. Many people believe what they want to believe despite the evidence because of their prejudices and inclination to stereotype criminals. This film is similar in that Brandon and Philip are well to do and look like the type of fellows your parents would want you to date.Rope is worth watching if you're interested in Hitchcock's work although it could use some improvements.

But even if there had never been a movie called Clerks, Mallrats struck me as being like a million other movies out there and while I can relate to hangin at the mall as a teen, the characters, as many have stated on this board were just majorly obnoxious. Again, in Clerks, any obnoxiousness the characters or movie had was overcome by the hilarious but always intelligent humor. With Mallrats, it's just another teen movie.(LOL.) It didn't linger in my mind afterward and dragged a lot while it was on. Just wasn't into it.Perhaps I was spoiled by the greatness of Clerks(a movie I've seen so many times I have lost count.) But even if this hadn't been Smith who brought us Mallrats-I just didn't care for this. I wish there would have been better dialog, less rambling, more charm and genuine wit and have some more twists and turns.

Wood Jr. widely know these days as the worst movie director of all time. It tells the story with lot's of humor but it never gets disrespectful, or makes fun of Wood. Instead you actually will gain lot's of respect for his passion and his will power to make just that one movie that he would always be remembered for. The story of Edward D. Wood Jr. is tragic but the movie never becomes sad. It is the perfect homage and tribute to this unfortunate director. You can see by watching this movie that Tim Burton in a way really admires Wood's life and his work.We get to see Wood as a filmmaker and as an individual. We get to know his weird lifestyle and his eccentric famous friendsOK the movie might no be a completely fair biography about Wood. It takes lot's of liberties with telling the story and it only shows the bright days of Wood's life but as movie it works really well and is next to Edward Sciccorhands Burton's best movie till date, truly a masterpiece!The cast is terrific. Johnn Depp in a Tim Burton movie is always jackpot. Sarah Jessica Parker impressed me and Martin Landau truly is perfect as Bela Lugosi. Bill Murray does what he can best, acting crazy! The Danny Elfman like music by Howard Shore is really great and also great as an homage to the 50's horror soundtracks.The movie works both as a comedy and as a drama. It knows to find the perfect balance but mainly still the movie is just extremely fun to watch. The movie really has tons of laughs and is filled with some incredible crazy character's but like I said before, it never becomes disrespectful to anyone.I must say that Ed Wood really changed my life. It got me interested in not just only Ed Wood movies but 50's horror movies in general. It also made me a big fan of the famous Hammer film's.A brilliant, strange, tragic, fun homage to the man who will always be remembered as the worst director of all time.10\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"14 March 2005","score":"13 out of 14 people found the following review useful","review":" When you see an Indian organist playing in a meat-house with the meat still cooling in it, while a transvestite is performing a belly dance without his teeth and is making Bela Lugosi swing, you know it...you're watching a Tim Burton movie.The movie brilliantly tells the story about Edward D.
