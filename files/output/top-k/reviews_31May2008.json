He's pretty good, and so are the other performers. Loved Eddie Murphy as the loser\/brother of Kit Ramsey. The film is efficiently directed.The humor, as in a lot of Steve Martin's stuff in The New Yorker, depends on incongruities and irony. The incongruity begins with the title of the film-within-a-film that Martin is supposed to be directing -- Chubby Rain. (Cf., Cruel Shoes.) The irony shows up in scenes like the post-coital murmurs between Martin and Heather Graham as a would-be actress sleeping her way to the top. I love you. I promise you I'll never use you, she tells him. And I will never betray your trust, he swears, after just having pocketed her credit card.Frank Oz did a good job on the direction. The scene is which an Eddie Murphy look alike (Eddie Murphy) is told to run across a multiple-lane freeway full of speeding cars and trucks is nearly perfectly done. Not just the idea but the set up and execution. The editing couldn't be better. Oz had to transpose that scene from a more-or-less detailed written screenplay into two dimensional images.Sometimes the script gives Oz an easier job than at others. As the end of the film approaches the pace becomes frantic and there were times when I lost it. Something to do with aliens and pod people. (One shot is lifted directly from Invasion of the Body Snatchers.) Martin is a bright and imaginative guy, obviously. His humor borders on the fantastic. Things take place that are physically impossible. And the jokes are liable to be over the head of a less alert audience. I mean, are the kids really going to get the connection between MindBust and Dianetics? Will they recognize the allusion to the pod people? He's rather like a West Coast Woody Allen, without the serious side, but more of a physical actor. His notion of what's funny is more literary than cinematic, bent slightly towards the late S. J. Perelman. I thought Martin's first film, The Jerk, was a disaster but there were scenes and dialog in this one that had me laughing out loud. When Eddie Murphy, as a famous movie star, is offered a script, he counts up all the k's in the text, divides by three, and comes up with the number of times the KKK is mentioned in code.

George Lucas is known for, along with his special effects and Star Wars films, awful scripts. The most recent Star Wars films are so poorly written they make me cringe, and this is George Lucas's only good script to date, possibly because it wasn't entirely written by him. American Graffiti is a low budget classic that really makes you feel like you're in 1962, and by the end, you won't want to leave.Here we have four stories about teens graduating high school, each one different, each one surprisingly good. There's Curt (Richard Dreyfus) who's confused if he wants to go to college or just stay home and go to junior college. After some turn of events, he ends up with a gang of hoodlums. Steve (Ron Howard) said the wrong thing to his girlfriend and is trying to patch things up. Terry (Charles Martin Smith) is taking care of Steve's car when Steve goes away to college, and he picks up a good lookin' chick, which results in many comedic situations. John Milner (Paul Le Mat) is a drag racer trying to pick up chicks, but he gets more than he bargained for when he ends up with the 13 year old sister (played by a young Mackenzie Phillips) of a female acquaintance of his. All four of these stories take place over one night, and they all level each other out nicely.All the kids give good performances here. Some are stereotypes, but they are likable stereotypes that break out of the mold and become more than one dimensional characters. The sub-plots are genuinely funny, and in some ways this actually reminds me of two later movies rolled into one. This movie is like John Landis's two films Animal House and The Blues Brothers packed into one good movie. It has the rowdy teens, and fast cars, and it has the cool 50's and early 60's music. The situations these characters face are often imitated in more recent films. For example, in Superbad, an underage character trying to but alcohol almost gets away with it, but the store is robbed. Here, the character gets away with it, and the store is robbed...it's like the same scenario.I know my review contained a few comparisons to other films, but with a great teen comedy like this, all you can do is compare it to imitators, and this comes out on top. Perhaps a young George Lucas was inspired to (co)write this good script, or perhaps he just happened to strike lightening, something his writing would not do again. Prove me wrong Mr. Lucas! My rating *** 1\/2 out of ****. 110 mins. PG for language, sexual innuendos.

It was stuff like the small penis scene that did not even get a small laugh from me, and it is partly due to that scene, and the blow job scene really made it hard to watch at times.

It's a study of conflicting egos and the dog-eat-dog mentality. Wall Street also seems to double up as a 1980s version of 'dawn of man' cavemen attempting to get 'one up' on their rivals and closest friends. You can just see primate males billions of years ago scuffling over meat from the latest kill or challenging one another over territory. Wall Street is this sort of ego dominated, cut-throat, quick buck here and there look of one-upmanship only with skyscrapers instead of caves and stocks and shares instead of the latest kill.Wall Street unfolds in a concrete jungle of sorts. Towering skyscrapers, desks lined with state of the art (for the time) computers, screens and masses of information shooting across digital news tickers. Do we know what these numbers and fractions mean? Are we ever told what they all mean? Do we need to know? I don't think we are but I do think we are supposed to trust the lively and young Bud Fox (Sheen) as he translates their meanings and digits in double quick fashion. Then there are the scenes that occur within Bud's apartment as it towers over the rest of the city. It is a postmodern space that would have its wallpaper in a 'mock' style of a dull brick wall. It is a space in which Fox and his partner will just stop and look at their meals before eating them because they are able and it is a space in which we will witness Bud purchasing; not because he is but because he can and I think that is the idea behind the film.But like I say, the film is male dominated. Women exist in the film's world to either look pretty, act as secretaries or be there to make love to epitomised by the character of Darien Taylor, played by Daryl Hannah who incidentally picked up a Razzie award. But then again it's not her fault as any actress playing this role would probably have won. This is because the film adopts such a male based approach that it comes close to resembling a gangster film of sorts. The film is about one man's rise through a selected hierarchy. The protagonist wears suits; mingles with those more powerful than he is; wines and dines expensively; will soon not have to worry about money and of course the women in the genre are a distraction, they are best seen and not heard which is exactly the case here.So I would be very selective as to who I would recommend this to. I, as a white male living in the 'Western' world, had no problem with the film and thoroughly enjoyed every twisty, turning, developing curve that the film presented to me. Others on the other hand might not be so impressed. I think it is because I like the gangster genre that I liked Wall Street so much. The development of Bud is also enjoyable as is the way Sheen's father Martin plays Bud's father Carl in much the same way that suggests 'anchor role'. Carl is the voice of reason and if Gordon Gekko (Douglas) thinks greed is good then Carl despises the very idea. Perhaps there is no coincidence Carl and Gordon's surnames are both animals A gekko is a lizard which suggests creepy, crawling and a slithery presence whereas a fox (at least in English folklore) suggests cunning, pride and smarter than your average. These characteristics are epitomised by both men who share the respective qualities with Bud (being a Fox) being dragged more toward the 'Gekko' mentality.So Bud is a man with a mission; he wants to elevate himself from the desk job and does so threatening to loose best friends and family members in the process his father, his partner and his buddy who works behind him. Bud is a man whose quest is just the other end of the phone as he talks to rich 'made it' guys about the possibility of buying into some unknown stocks. He wants to be on the other end of that phone call. The greed and obsession to do well and become someone briefly turns Bud into a stalker as he follows Terrance Stamp's Sir Larry Wildman, himself a man of great power and wealth &#150; no surprise that he is an English character being played by an Englishman as this role usually demands some sort of 'leveller' with the narrative's antagonist (if not then the Englishman is the antagonist himself). For some reason Hollywood see it fit to do this and it is best demonstrated in films like The Silence of the Lambs and Die Hard (Hopkins and Rickman, respectively).So Wall Street develops and develops into a cat and mouse tale revolving around an airline. What can we tell from this? Well, airlines run aeroplanes (obviously) and the aeroplane is, I think, a metaphor for being 'above' everyone else. This company has become the centre for the film's finale and it deals in transportation that 'elevates' its customers above a certain ground level (much like Gekko's skyscraper and Bud's apartment). It is also something both Bud and Gordon are in direct competition for. Like 'The Long Good Friday', this is close to England vs. USA at business\/expansion round two. Round one was in London and instigated by Harold Shand, round two is in New York and involves Gekko, Fox and Wildman but while the antagonism is never there between the two sides like it was seven years earlier, so much more is and whatever is there is close to genius.

The protagonist wears suits; mingles with those more powerful than he is; wines and dines expensively; will soon not have to worry about money and of course the women in the genre are a distraction, they are best seen and not heard which is exactly the case here.So I would be very selective as to who I would recommend this to. I, as a white male living in the 'Western' world, had no problem with the film and thoroughly enjoyed every twisty, turning, developing curve that the film presented to me. Others on the other hand might not be so impressed. I think it is because I like the gangster genre that I liked Wall Street so much. The development of Bud is also enjoyable as is the way Sheen's father Martin plays Bud's father Carl in much the same way that suggests 'anchor role'. Carl is the voice of reason and if Gordon Gekko (Douglas) thinks greed is good then Carl despises the very idea. Perhaps there is no coincidence Carl and Gordon's surnames are both animals A gekko is a lizard which suggests creepy, crawling and a slithery presence whereas a fox (at least in English folklore) suggests cunning, pride and smarter than your average. These characteristics are epitomised by both men who share the respective qualities with Bud (being a Fox) being dragged more toward the 'Gekko' mentality.So Bud is a man with a mission; he wants to elevate himself from the desk job and does so threatening to loose best friends and family members in the process his father, his partner and his buddy who works behind him. Bud is a man whose quest is just the other end of the phone as he talks to rich 'made it' guys about the possibility of buying into some unknown stocks. He wants to be on the other end of that phone call. The greed and obsession to do well and become someone briefly turns Bud into a stalker as he follows Terrance Stamp's Sir Larry Wildman, himself a man of great power and wealth &#150; no surprise that he is an English character being played by an Englishman as this role usually demands some sort of 'leveller' with the narrative's antagonist (if not then the Englishman is the antagonist himself). For some reason Hollywood see it fit to do this and it is best demonstrated in films like The Silence of the Lambs and Die Hard (Hopkins and Rickman, respectively).So Wall Street develops and develops into a cat and mouse tale revolving around an airline. What can we tell from this? Well, airlines run aeroplanes (obviously) and the aeroplane is, I think, a metaphor for being 'above' everyone else. This company has become the centre for the film's finale and it deals in transportation that 'elevates' its customers above a certain ground level (much like Gekko's skyscraper and Bud's apartment). It is also something both Bud and Gordon are in direct competition for. Like 'The Long Good Friday', this is close to England vs. USA at business\/expansion round two. Round one was in London and instigated by Harold Shand, round two is in New York and involves Gekko, Fox and Wildman but while the antagonism is never there between the two sides like it was seven years earlier, so much more is and whatever is there is close to genius.

That was funny stuff. Whether you admit you like raunchy dildo humor, or fart humor, or anything along those lines, you HAVE to laugh when he wakes up and pees all over the wall, and then finds out about the dildo being stuck up his azz. And later when Irene informs him that he stuck it up his OWN azz that was funny as hell too. The fight scenes by the train, with the get yer foot long and a bag of nuts was hilariously funny. The fight scene in the Mustang wasn't quite as funny, but that was funny too. Some of the most funny scenes were made with his foul mouthed, brilliant, BLACK sons. The fact that he never really acknowledged that they weren't biologically his sons, but you knew that deep down he knew it and loved them anyway, it was rather endearing. And come on, the cop with the chicken up his azz, that was funny shite. This was classic Jim Carrey, and a great movie. NOBODY could have played a schizophrenic psychopath who fought with himself, and acted like an azz as well as Jim Carrey. And as for Irene, Renee Zellweger, she played the perfect victim\/fugitive.

The movie is about three different stories which are taking place in the same place at the same time (at night in some cheap motel). Jim Jarmusch is really good in telling different stories who are connected one to each other and also in this case he's doing a great job. The characters in the movie are very realistic, likable and you can feel connected to them despite the fact they're always in some bizarre troubles. Mystery train is another movie which shows the life of common people, but I think this is his funniest movie, just before Night on earth. The humor is fresh and unpredictable, very warm and realistic. The movie consists of three different stories Far from Yokohama - the first story of a young Japanese couple, obsessed with Elvis Presley. From the beginning very humorous clip, but both man and woman were really annoying for my taste and after a while this clip became boring and uninteresting, especially the last clip with sex scene in hotel.Ghost - I liked this one. Very funny, somewhere scary with the story of the ghost of Elvis Presley haunting the city, but overall a really good clip. The appearance of Elvis was very funny and the dialog between two main female characters were also great.Lost in space - The best clip. Funny and sad at the same time. Steve Buscemi is really funny in this clip, also Joe Strummer was very convincing character. The way this clip ends is one of the best movie scenes I've ever seen - the characters running away from the police, despite the fact that the police are not looking for them. The best clip in the whole movie.In all three clips I especially liked Tom Waits and his voice as a DJ on a local radio. Overall, Mystery Train is a funny movie, with a lot of drama, comedy and memorable scenes. Jarmusch is really a genius of making movies and this one proves it. For the fans of Jarmusch this is MUST SEE movie.

This paring of mismatched roommates created one of the most successful TV series of all time as well as countless, not anywhere near as good, imitations.The Odd Couple movie has some wonderful jokes about Oscar's apartment and his sloppy habits. He says, Who wants food? One of his poker player buddies asks, What do ya got? Oscar says, I got brown sandwiches and green sandwiches. What's the brown? It's either very new cheese or very old meat! I also love the line about Oscar's refrigerator, It's been out of order for two weeks, I saw milk standing in there that wasn't even in a bottle! There is no question that Walter Matthau's Oscar Madison is a joy to watch on screen. He's almost as good as Jack Klugman's version in the TV series.The problem with the movie is Jack Lemmon's Felix Ungar. Jack makes a very, very, honest effort at the role. The problem is that he makes Felix SO depressing and down-trodden that he becomes more annoying than comical. Tony Randall's performance in the series, brought the kind of humor, warmth, and sensitivity, to Felix's character, which Lemmon's portrayal lacks. Tony's Felix Unger obviously could be annoying some of the time. However, in the TV series, it related to specific situations where the annoyance was needed in the storyline. Jack's Felix Ungar, (note the different spelling) in the movie, seems to never be happy, fun, or interesting. The movie Felix Ungar is a roommate that drives you up the wall, all the time.The movie still has great moments that withstand the test of time, the famous meatloaf fight is one of the greatest scenes ever! One of the other great examples of Felix's little notes on Oscar's pillow will be remembered forever. However, there are some darker sides where Oscar goes over the top, His crying near the end after bawling out Felix, and a scene involving Felix's Linguine dinner, (although lightened by a funny line.) seem more depressing than comical.Perhaps there wasn't enough time to see the lighter side of these characters that made the series so memorable in the movie. The beginning 20 minutes are very boring. The same issue occurs with Felix's conversation with the Pidgeon Sisters. The movie's ending is predictable and too pat. There's very little care or compassion for each of them by the other. The result is that the darker side of the film leads to a lot of depression and anger, rather than comedy, unless you are watching the great scenes described above. It appears that Jack Lemmon's monotone persona of Felix brings the film down, rather than enhances or embraces the comedy between the characters.It really took the 1970's TV series to make The Odd Couple the best that it could be.

Their confrontation in an empty train station room is the point where the marriage crumbles.The Way We Were was up for several Oscars in 1973, but only won one Oscar for it's haunting and lovely theme song by Marvin Hamlisch. It has since become one of the songs (like Julie Styne's Don't Rain On My Parade) that are associated with Streisand, as she sang both. But it has much more going for it, including it's screenplay by Arthur Laurents and the performances in general (including supporting parts by Lois Chiles, Herb Edelman, George Gaynes, and a young James Woods). The film also was well directed by Sydney Pollack, the second of seven films Pollack did with Redford as the star. It has now become a kind of cultural icon of its own, being referred to on programs like Sex and the City, The Gilmore Girls, and even (in a funny stretch) The Nanny. Although Pollack's Oscar was for Out of Africa, and his best liked film was possibly Tootsie, I think that in the long run it will be The Way We Were which will be Pollack's best remembered film.Therefore, I dedicate this review to the memory of Sydney Pollack, who died of cancer last week.

So the shock, awe, and surprise for me was the firsthand reactions of someone who had never seen or known anything about the film. Of course, that was back in an age where there was no internet, very few channels to watch on TV, and spoilers weren't put out forever and a day. I was lucky. I hope anyone who hasn't seen film and enjoys films is as lucky as I was.You know the story THE GREATEST MACGUFFIN EVER TOLD! The great Alfred Hitchcock totally fools us into thinking that this masterwork is about retrieving a stolen $40,000 when in fact it is about SOOOOO much more than that! Marion Crane (played by the great Janet Leigh in a complex, sexy, heartbreaking performance) steals the money from her boss, an insurance agent, then 'steals' off (pun intended) 'into the night' (actually it was daytime) with the money. Along the way she has thoughts of various conflicting thoughts and emotions of the results of her actions and ends up at the Bates Motel.Ahh, the Bates Motel! The most famous location in all of film history! Marion meets the proprietor and manager Norman Bates (played by none other than Anthony Perkins in one of the most stunning, sterling, fascinating, perfect performances in film history). Norman is the mama's boy to end all mamas boys! The parlor conversation between Norman and Marion has got to be, to this day, one of the most fascinating talks between two lost souls ever put to screen. The angular way that Hitchcock shot it adds to its brilliance. The albeit too brief 'relationship' between Norman and Marion is never talked about enough for me it's obvious that her sexuality intimidates him and is rather off-putting. And you can tell that she finds his sweetness and vulnerability a refreshing change from the big city jerks that she is used to. Two great performances, both of which should have won Oscars. Leigh was nominated for Best Supporting Actress and the fact that Perkins wasn't nominated for Best Actor may be the all time biggest oversight in Oscar history.PSYCHO is fascinating on so many levels and gets a lot about human nature right the aforementioned sexuality that lies within all of us, the different levels of guilt that all humans possess (virtually every character in this film is guilty of SOMETHING), the ways that men objectify women, and fact that all of us at heart are shaped by our parents, whether we'd want to admit it or not.This is Alfred Hitchcock's greatest film accomplishment for me, and that says a lot because he is my favorite director of all time. He got nominated for Best Director (the Academy got that part right), but didn't win (Academy got this one wrong). And PSYCHO is in the top 5 films of all time for me also. It is a landmark that ironically inspired thousands (maybe millions) knock-offs about psychotic mama-boy serial killers. But this is the film with the real heart and soul.

You can't help but laugh the third time you see Anna Falchi show up as a different character, or when the retarded guy vomits on the mayor's daughter. Overall, it's a charming horror film that never fails to entertain. The weirdness and abstract nature of the film continues to build right to the head-scratching ending. About the only problems with Cemetery Man are that is seems to drag on with no actual ending in sight at a few points (because the story is so weird and the film is roughly two hours long) and there are some truly cheap special effects with spirits in the cemetery.

Only by doing so can my review make sense.Let's get the basic's down first. This film, along with the previous film, are two of the greatest 80s films ever made, along with The Breakfast Club and Back to the Future. It's also full of great 80's music, most notably the fine tunage provided to us by Chicago.The film opens with characters already fully developed. These characters we got to know well in the previous film, so we were able to dive right into the story without having to endure development of unknown protagonists. The only new people we are introduced to are the ones we meet upon arriving in Okinawa. The character development there is very well done, and we meet both some protagonists and some nasty villains as well. Of course, one of the villains sees the light and realizes the error of his ways before we get to see a glorious fight between him and Miyagi, which would have been awesome. I kind of wish we could have seen such a battle. But we did get to see a great fight between Daniel and Chozen, a cold hearted punk with nothing but personal honor on his mind, even though he was a cheat and a coward.I really like Kumiko, the girl that Daniel fell in love with. I liked Ali in the first film, but not as much. Since in the beginning of this movie we are told that his relationship with Ali collapsed, we are left looking for Daniel's new love interest in the plot, and we find it in this gorgeous beauty from Okinawa. It takes a really long time to get the romance going but it was well done once it started....Chicago provided nice music for this. The tea ceremony scene was great for me, because at the end of it, Kumiko took the chopsticks out of her hair, which was up for the entire film, and the straight black Asian hair was allowed to flow all the way down her back. We are then interrupted by a typhoon, which provides the backdrop for Sato's transformation from evil to good, and Chozen's descent into shame and cowardice.To skip ahead into Karate Kid Part III, we learn that Kumiko does not return to the States with Daniel, and he is left womanless once again. He meets Jessica, but she is not worthy of discussion as they do not progress beyond friendship. The question remains.....if Daniel and Kumiko were so in love, and if her dream to become a dancer was so strong, why did she not stay with Daniel? He fought to the death for her! He put his life on the line in a death match with Chozen. As much as I love that character, I think she needs to have some sense slapped into her. In my mind, that is a serious, foolish mistake, but we are not exposed to this error until Karate Kid Part III, since Part II ends as soon as the fight is over.Overall, great film. I give it an 8, which I reserve for films that I can easily watch over and over again without getting tired of them. I highly recommend it, as well as Part I and Part III, which I have elected not to review at this time. The title of this review is the best line in the film.See my profile for my rating philosophy.

We are then interrupted by a typhoon, which provides the backdrop for Sato's transformation from evil to good, and Chozen's descent into shame and cowardice.To skip ahead into Karate Kid Part III, we learn that Kumiko does not return to the States with Daniel, and he is left womanless once again. He meets Jessica, but she is not worthy of discussion as they do not progress beyond friendship. The question remains.....if Daniel and Kumiko were so in love, and if her dream to become a dancer was so strong, why did she not stay with Daniel? He fought to the death for her! He put his life on the line in a death match with Chozen. As much as I love that character, I think she needs to have some sense slapped into her. In my mind, that is a serious, foolish mistake, but we are not exposed to this error until Karate Kid Part III, since Part II ends as soon as the fight is over.Overall, great film. I give it an 8, which I reserve for films that I can easily watch over and over again without getting tired of them. I highly recommend it, as well as Part I and Part III, which I have elected not to review at this time. The title of this review is the best line in the film.See my profile for my rating philosophy.

To me, this is not a perfect family film, but unlike many movies that claim to be family films, this actually is a FAMILY FILM. Kids like it for the relate able situations and amusing dialogue between the kids, adults will find it's very easy to get wrapped up in this, even though it is just a silly kiddie movie and anyone in between will probably enjoy this too.Scotty has just moved to a new neighborhood, and isn't accepted by the other children. Eventually, he begins playing baseball with them at the local sandlot, and several adventures come from this. The main story is Scotty losing his step dad's (Dennis Leary) signed Babe Ruth baseball in the backyard with an evil dog the kids refer to as The Beast.This movie has some genuinely amusing scenes, and some scenes so campy, they're hilarious. One scene involves a young boys plan to make out with the attractive older girl lifeguard at the public pool, and this scene is kind of a classic, which may be seen in movies after or even before this, but it was just done so great here. Any scene involving The Beast is hilarious. Depending on the scene, this dog changes shape and size, and can be anything from a large dog to some kind of mutated super monster. This dog puts the shark in Jaws to shame. It's good the kids each have their own distinct personalities, and aren't entirely run on stereotypes. One small problem is the lack of any emotional conflict, which may or may not be a problem depending on your point of view. I would have liked something to tug at the audiences' heart strings, but nothing does. It's still a good movie however.Overall, this is a fun movie for all...not great, but good enough to be enjoyed by the whole family.My rating *** out of ****. 100 mins. PG for language, tobacco use.

Whether we see strong winds and gigantic flood waves to daring sea rescues, the effects here are the real stars, even if some of the leads include George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg Diane Lane and a dozen others. But really, the star is the storm, since much of the human characters here are cookie-cutter disaster movie material.THE PERFECT STORM is based on an autobiographical novel by Sebastian Junger, but the film is dampened as a cookie-cutter disaster movie that's a little weak on drama, which threatens the film's pacing. The film is quite slow, aiming to create a lot of dramatic scenes with the characters, but they are weak, considering that they are played by top-flight players. The performances are terrific of course, what more could we expect from popular Hollywood names? Although there seemed to be drama going on, it's hardly the film's finest moments.Much of the finest moments however goes to the storm itself. The special effects are marvelous in this film, even by today's standards. It's not as flashy, but that's probably for the best since the effects are need to be more real than cinematic. In fact, the scenes with the storm are more dramatic than any of the scenes with the humans. The scenes involving the daring sea rescues are breathtakingly compelling, and very well done of course. In a way, the storm offers the finest performance of the lot. Overall, the storm is perfect, which might be exactly what you payed for.

This has resulted in a number of his works being over-hyped to the point of the ridiculous.Saving Private Ryan is most certainly one of those films. Here we have a thin and totally implausible story, shallow characters, lack of historical authenticity... yet a reputation (confirmed on this board) of being the best war movie of all time.Let me refute that view on just a couple of points.First, we should be clear that, while the opening D-Day sequence is certainly Spielberg at his best, it is by no means the best -- nor the first -- big-screen depiction of the realities of war. In fact, it's largely a rip-off of the equally good, and much earlier, beach-landing sequence in Cornel Wilde's 1967 tour-de-force, Beach Red. Spielberg modernizes the visuals very effectively, but does not improve on that earlier work, and in fact, echoes many specific sequences within it. (Wilde's film is also far more powerful in the rest of its story.)Second, aside from Private Ryan's many other weaknesses, I find most glaring it's unintentional irony. What country in WW II - other than the USA - could in its wildest dreams enjoy the luxury of bringing back one son merely because his siblings had died???

Done deliberately, this could have been a deliciously vitriolic statement on how the powers-that-be manipulate fighting men in the field. Instead, it's more like a slap in the face to the very men it attempts to honor. I have no idea how prevalent the Private Ryan reprieve really was; but presenting it without context does a disservice to the entire force.On the positive side, there's no denying the production is well-mounted.

This has resulted in a number of his works being over-hyped to the point of the ridiculous.Saving Private Ryan is most certainly one of those films. Here we have a thin and totally implausible story, shallow characters, lack of historical authenticity... yet a reputation (confirmed on this board) of being the best war movie of all time.Let me refute that view on just a couple of points.First, we should be clear that, while the opening D-Day sequence is certainly Spielberg at his best, it is by no means the best -- nor the first -- big-screen depiction of the realities of war. In fact, it's largely a rip-off of the equally good, and much earlier, beach-landing sequence in Cornel Wilde's 1967 tour-de-force, Beach Red. Spielberg modernizes the visuals very effectively, but does not improve on that earlier work, and in fact, echoes many specific sequences within it. (Wilde's film is also far more powerful in the rest of its story.)Second, aside from Private Ryan's many other weaknesses, I find most glaring it's unintentional irony.

","genre":"Action, Drama, War"},{"date":"31 May 2008","score":"","review":" Goodfellas is an exceptional mobster film, but not because of it's plot or script. It's a good plot, nothing too exceptional however, and the characters are pretty solid throughout, every one being a complete sleaze-ball. The performances are amazing. Ray Liotta is the main character and actually shows off his acting abilities best through his super slick narration throughout the film. Joe Pesci gives an outstanding supporting performance as the tough, wiseguy he plays in most movies, but for some reason it stands out here. Robert Deniro also gives an amazing(ly tough) and powerful performance. It's all about the cool direction and great acting for this film.Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) has always wanted to be a gangster ever since he was a young boy. We learn his background and how he gets caught up with the mobsters, from the good times to the bad. Two of his closest friends are Jimmy (Robert Deniro) and Tommy (Joe Pesci). Tommy (especially) goes crazy with power and eventually these three are working their way to the top of the mob standings.One problem with this movie is the lack of any soul or redeeming characters. The characters we are presented are interesting to listen to and follow, but we know each one is a violent criminal. Even movies like The Godfather or Pulp Fiction give us characters that if not redeeming, become somewhat redeeming by the end of the film and make us care about them. For all I cared, they could've massacred the entire cast of characters. I'd still have had a heck of a time watching them, as I did, they just weren't likable. Luckily, the most likable character is also the narrator and star of the film, Ray Liotta.Overall, this is a great mobster film, with some outstanding performances and snappy direction. However, the lack of any redeeming characters might annoy viewers who need at least one person to root for, though those people may find themselves rooting for the three main guys to murder to whole lot of them just for the entertainment value.My rating *** 1\/2 out of ****. 145 mins. R for violence, drug use, sexuality, language. ","genre":null},{"date":"31 May 2008","score":"","review":" Goodfellas is an exceptional mobster film, but not because of it's plot or script.

It really is just such a clever and inclusive way at looking at adolescence and high school cliques. The movie is easy to follow and the change in each character is gradually and believably seen.Judd Nelson is mesmerizingly charismatic as the witty and defensively flippant, John Bender. And really, he makes this movie. Not wanting to take anything away from the other actors, but he has about 40% of the dialog. If Nelson's performance had lacked even slightly, the whole movie could have fallen over. But he is fantastic.One of the most interesting things about this movie, is how much you care about the characters and how much you just wanted them to succeed at everything in the future. A sequel here, would not have gone astray. But obviously now, it is much too late. And the idea of a remake makes me nauseous. I would hate anyone else playing these characters. They were all that good.The most asked question, upon finishing the film is, no doubt, What's going to happen on Monday? And I, as much as anyone, would love to know the answer to that question. But ultimately, it doesn't matter. If they all ignored each other for the rest of their high school careers, it wouldn't matter. Because they still had something that day in detention. They still learned something about themselves from each other. And for a day, at least, they could say they were completely themselves, and they were still liked.I don't care if Judd Nelson was an a-hole to Molly Ringwald during filming, I don't care that they played horrible 80's music throughout (like seriously, they had Duran Duran, the Go's Go's, Cold Chisel, etc, they couldn't have taken one of those paths?), I don't care that there's no way that Emilio Estevez could have broken that glass simply by yelling (he's hardly Pavarotti). This movie is brilliant and a MUST watch for anyone over the age of thirteen.It'll change your life.
