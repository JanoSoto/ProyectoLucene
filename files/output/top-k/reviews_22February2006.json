Fanny Price, an analogue of previous Austen heroines Elizabeth Bennet and Eleanor Dashwood, is as likable, idyllic and insightful as any prototype Austen protagonist. The film's set design, costumes and castle used for Mansfield, are true to the feel of Austen's words, if some of the screenplay is modernized for our contemporary audience. However, her understanding of people--their desires, their character, their judgmental prejudices-comes shining through. Accessible to all viewers and not just Austen fans, Mansfield Park is a classic British style independent film able to introduce film fans to the literature of Jane Austen.

I loved it possibly my favourite film along side of lock stock also written and directed by guy Ritchie. I love this film about how the plot forms it has a great narrative. I love how it is typical to the form of genre that it is associated to. You will be in watching this all the way though and laughing it is great. Btw is you loved this you got to watch lock stock as well. It has great film form and the generic conventions are tied in brilliantly into the film. It creates a real sense of expectation from the narrative as you are driven though the story. It is stylishly shot with great angles which give the real effect of the film. It has a typical grimy look to it just like London it is typical of British cinema. I can watch this film over and over and every time I notice something new within the mise-en-sense of the film. Who ever said gangster films are dead they lied. ","genre":null},{"date":"22 February 2006","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" A positively brilliant film.
