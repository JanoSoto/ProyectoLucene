People say the film is not scary well what do you expect from a film about killer bats?. The film may not be scary but it was entertaining which is the whole reason we watch movies isn't it?. This film had a lot of exciting scenes in it. The film was well directed and well made and I liked the main three characters played by Lou diamond Phillips Nina Meyer and Leon. That's another thing I liked about this film there were actually (likeable characters) and most horror films don't have those but this did. I actually cared about what happened to these characters and I wanted them to Live. I found Leon funny and he gave good lines of dialogue and he was fun to watch. That's another thing that makes this film work,the cast was good. Lou diamond Phillips was also fun to watch and I found him to be a cool character and he played his role of the sheriff well. I also thought the acting from the three main people was Okay. I thought there were a lot of well done attack sequences especially the one at the start of the film which I thought was very bloody and brutal,I also thought the scene was shot well and the bats looked cool. There were some well shot scenes in the film one that I liked is when two of our main characters are trapped inside a car and a swarm of bats completely cover the car,they cover it so much you can barely see it anymore and I thought that was a bizarre but interesting scene. There were scenes where dozens of people were getting attacked in the street and there were bats flying around everywhere in and out of shops,people were getting attacked in restaurants and things were getting blown up and there was non stop Action. I'm surprised most people don't like this film because I thought it was Action packed!. I also liked how our main three characters worked together to try and stop the bats and they set traps for the bats. I especially liked the scene were Leon burns a bunch of bats with a flamethrower I thought that was a very Fun scene. That's why I'm giving praise to this film because it was low budget and they used the budget well and they were still able to create a lot of exciting action scenes and Fun moments. This has a lot of Action for a low budget film,and I found the story interesting. The film also has a very exciting and intense Finale that had me on the edge of my seat. This film was fun and fast paced and I recommend the film.

He had just done several motion pictures, starring in supporting roles. Some of them were the original Little Shop of Horrors and Easy Rider. Audiences by 1969 already knew who he was and what he stands for. In Easy Rider, he played a drunken Southern lawyer with a good heart, who hitched a ride with Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda on their motorcycle trip. But in 1970, Nicholson took on a role that would propel him not only toward the Academy Awards, but to movie audiences again with his leading role in Five Easy Pieces.In Five Easy Pieces, Nicholson plays Robert Bobby Dupea, a man who's a oil rigger at day and a free-wheeler at night. He spends much of his time in the oil fields and goes in and out of motels and bowling alleys with friends at night. Earler in his life, he was a piano prodigy and was raised by his parents who admired piano-playing. But, times have change. Nowadays, Dupea works constantly, trying to make his life better by sticking to his job. His friends encourages him to live the good life. But, to Bobby's point of view, his words isn't getting him nowhere. His girlfriend, (Karen Black), does her best to keep him out of trouble, but her relationship with Bobby soon start to crumble as his lifestyle of free-wheeling grows too much for her to handle. One day, Dupea receives word from his mother that his father had suffered two strokes and as a result, can't talk nor walk anymore. Devastated, Bobby decides to take his girlfriend to Puget Sound, which is in British Columbia. Along the way, they pick up two lebsian hitchhikers, who joined them on their ride to Washington. Little while on, Bobby drops them off and continue on with his trip. Once Dupea gets to Puget Sound, he tries to make amends to his deserted family, but realizes that it might be too late.Nicholson gives, what I think, a stand-out performance. Here's a character who is very different from the other characters that he would portrayed in his later films. Dupea is a angry, young man who doesn't know what he wants out of life. Another thing to point about Nicholoson's character is the dedication of the blue-collar worker. The movie illustrates a certain time frame in America, where anguish and rebellion were common. Nicholson was the right actor to play this person. The director or even the screenwriters would've thought that by casting an younger actor into this picture might make the audience identify with this person.There's one classic scene that explains entirely the attitude of Nicholson's character. At a diner that is located on a interstate highway, Nicholoson tries to order a breakfast with a substitution. When he can't get what he wanted, he goes out of his way to get exactly what he wants. That scene, while it's classic in every way, tells us that this character is a man who will not obey the rules to society and will do whatever he wants to do. Even with Nicholoson playing out that scene with Karen Black and the two hitchhikers. I think it is clear that no other actor would've play out that scene if it wasn't for Nicholoson's anger. that's why I think he was one of the biggest emerging stars in Hollywood at that time. He is a actor that will do things differently and opposite and as soon as he changes the game, he can be satisfied with what he wants.Besides Nicholson, Karen Black does a terrific job, playing Nicholoson's dim-witted waitress girlfriend. For her character to work, she acts like an attachment to Dupea. She is sort of the glue that sticks and keeps together the relationship. But as the film progresses on, we sense early on that their relationship might not last for long. Even after watching this movie for the first time, I got a sense that the running theme of loneliness that applies directly toward the Karen Black's character. In the beginning of the movie, she is alone in her house while Bobby is working on the oil fields. In the end, she finds herself alone again, except that it would probably means that this will be the last time.For me, examining cinema has been a favorite of mine. Movies from the 70's were really about the 70's themselves. After seeing Five Easy Pieces, I knew that this movie would open up the gates of New Hollywood. because of that, new directors especially Bob Rafelson, who directed directed this movie, had the ability to direct what he wanted to see. I feel as if with the upcoming movies that came later in the 1970's, movie audiences were seeing flesh and blood characters being portrayed on the big screen. I might sound like the kind of guy that said that they make don't movies like this anymore, but in the case of Five Easy Pieces, that's an exception. ★★★★ 4 stars.

New Hollywood directors were already starting to make movies that they wanted to see. Directors such as Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Brian De Palma, Bob Rafelson and others were making movies that would launch them into stardom. Disaster movies also launch people into stardom. But, one particular director did get recognition for his body of work in the 1970's by creating some of the best disaster movies of all time. His name? Irwin Allen.Allen was a producer who's nickname was the Master of Disaster. One of his earliest motion pictures was Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea in 1961. Because Voyage was a big hit in 1961, Allen decides to make movies and by the early 70's, he hit the jackpot. By 1972, The Poseidon Adventure was one of the high-grossing movies at that time. It took a while to get the movie off the ground. And doing so wasn't a easy task.The movie tells the story of a luxury ocean liner called the S.S Poseidon, en route from New York to Athens. Among the many passengers on the S.S Poseidon are Reverand Scott (Gene Hackman), policeman Mike Rogo, (Ernest Borgnine), an shy and meek bachelor, (Red Buttons), an elderly Jewish couple, (Jack Alberton and Shelly Winters), and a brother and sister, (Pamela Sue Martin and Eric Shea). All of these characters aboard the S.S Poseidon are celebrating New Year's Eve that night.Just after midnight, the ship's crew and passengers's celebration soon came to a stop when a 90 foot tidal wave, capsizing the ship, sending the passengers, crashing down on what used to be the ship's ceiling. Once the ship capsizes, the remaining survivors must race against time as the liner starts to fill with water. Along the way, the few remaining passengers must work their way toward the engine room in order to escape. The obstacles that they have to cross are the hot and steamy kitchen, the flooded smokestack, claustrophobic vents and pipes and underwater passageways.The Poseidon Adventure is based on a best-selling novel by Paul Gallico. Gallico based his novel on a incident he had on the RMS Queen Mary. The movie though is not excellent nor four-star material. But, it does work for a few reasons. One of them is the visual effects. The F\/X are very convincing and very exciting as the ship capsizes although in some exterior shots of the ship, it looks at as if the makers of the movie used a miniature ship instead of a real ship. What I like about The Poseidon Adventure is the sheer camp style of the movie itself. Disaster movies are not really movies that you would overpraise because of the number of stars that they used, but what does makes sense is that they are equivalently exciting as a popcorn movie. This is one of those films where even though today, it looks dated, it can still be enjoyed and still be loved for a very long time.The performances though, aren't really Oscar caliber. Hackman at that time in 1972, had already won the Oscar for The French Connection. I wonder why he would signed on to a picture like this.

Now, of course, you might say to yourselves, Isn't that a bad idea? Is it a bad idea to have actors do as much physical work instead of acting? Sometimes yes and sometimes no. But what does come out of it is that disaster movies are basically plugged in plots and characters. The Poseidon Adventure is the perfect example. On a level of camp, it works. But as a spectacular motion picture, it doesn't work. The reason why is that because disaster movies, in my opinion, don't need to exceed excellence. A few examples of bad disaster movies that I think failed to excite me or intrigue me are The Hindenburg, When Time Ran Out, Earthquake, Aiport 1975, Airport '77 and The Concorde Aiport '79.After the success of The Poseidon Adventure, Allen continue to work throughout the 1970's.

New Hollywood directors were already starting to make movies that they wanted to see. Directors such as Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Brian De Palma, Bob Rafelson and others were making movies that would launch them into stardom. Disaster movies also launch people into stardom. But, one particular director did get recognition for his body of work in the 1970's by creating some of the best disaster movies of all time. His name? Irwin Allen.Allen was a producer who's nickname was the Master of Disaster. One of his earliest motion pictures was Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea in 1961. Because Voyage was a big hit in 1961, Allen decides to make movies and by the early 70's, he hit the jackpot. By 1972, The Poseidon Adventure was one of the high-grossing movies at that time. It took a while to get the movie off the ground. And doing so wasn't a easy task.The movie tells the story of a luxury ocean liner called the S.S Poseidon, en route from New York to Athens. Among the many passengers on the S.S Poseidon are Reverand Scott (Gene Hackman), policeman Mike Rogo, (Ernest Borgnine), an shy and meek bachelor, (Red Buttons), an elderly Jewish couple, (Jack Alberton and Shelly Winters), and a brother and sister, (Pamela Sue Martin and Eric Shea). All of these characters aboard the S.S Poseidon are celebrating New Year's Eve that night.Just after midnight, the ship's crew and passengers's celebration soon came to a stop when a 90 foot tidal wave, capsizing the ship, sending the passengers, crashing down on what used to be the ship's ceiling. Once the ship capsizes, the remaining survivors must race against time as the liner starts to fill with water. Along the way, the few remaining passengers must work their way toward the engine room in order to escape. The obstacles that they have to cross are the hot and steamy kitchen, the flooded smokestack, claustrophobic vents and pipes and underwater passageways.The Poseidon Adventure is based on a best-selling novel by Paul Gallico. Gallico based his novel on a incident he had on the RMS Queen Mary. The movie though is not excellent nor four-star material. But, it does work for a few reasons. One of them is the visual effects. The F\/X are very convincing and very exciting as the ship capsizes although in some exterior shots of the ship, it looks at as if the makers of the movie used a miniature ship instead of a real ship. What I like about The Poseidon Adventure is the sheer camp style of the movie itself. Disaster movies are not really movies that you would overpraise because of the number of stars that they used, but what does makes sense is that they are equivalently exciting as a popcorn movie. This is one of those films where even though today, it looks dated, it can still be enjoyed and still be loved for a very long time.The performances though, aren't really Oscar caliber. Hackman at that time in 1972, had already won the Oscar for The French Connection. I wonder why he would signed on to a picture like this.

In particular, Collateral Damage was delayed due to its themes about terrorism and its marketing campaign had to be reworked. Regardless, the film was still a disappointment. Once upon a time, Arnold Schwarzenegger was the #1 box office champion who could not go wrong. However, his vulnerability showed following the disappointment of Last Action Hero (1993). His star was on the wane following such box office flops as Batman and Robin (1997) and End of Days (1999). Collateral Damage certainly wasn't going to revive Arnold Schwarzenegger's career. In what was ominous signs, Arnold Schwarzenegger's glory days were as good as over. His career was briefly resurrected following the success of Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines (2003) before he made the big decision to switch from Hollywood to politics, in which he was later elected as the Governor of California.Collateral Damage is about a Los Angeles firefighter Gordon Brewster (Arnold Schwarzenegger)who's wife and son are killed in a bomb blast outside the Colombian Consulate building as well as killing seven others. The person behind the bomb blast is revealed to be a terrorist calling himself El Lobo (The Wolf) also known as Claudio Perrini (Cliff Curtis). The Wolf further explains that the bomb was in retaliation for America's oppression of Colombia. Brewster is angered when the victims including his wife and son are considered to be collateral damage. CIA Special Agent Peter Brandt (Elias Koteas) has been tasked to take down The Wolf, but Gordon Brewster wants to cut through the red tape and take down the wolf himself. Also assisting Brewster when he reaches Columbia is a mysterious woman named Selena (Francesca Neri) who Brewster saves from an attack in Columbia along with her young son. Also appearing in small roles are John Leguizamo and John Turturro.The movie itself is very unrealistic and very dated. In fact this could have been a movie that could have been made in the 80's. And don't get me started on the fact a fireman wants to go down and take on the terrorists himself. Get real. If the character was a member of the police, military or even a government agency then the film would have been more believable. But a fireman?! That's where the film fails. Even for an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, this film is notable for his character in an action movie that does not touch a single firearm. Instead he uses makeshift bombs and takes on terrorists in hand to hand combat. It is not realistic to have an everyman take on terrorism and then see him in action kicking butt. Arnold is also on the negative side of 50 which makes him a bit too old to be taking on terrorists that he could have easily done with ease 10 years earlier. The story was very uninspiring, predictable and derivative with several inconsistent plot holes. If Arnold Schwarzenegger was not in Collateral Damage, I would not have given this movie a second thought. Collateral Damage is an unusual miss for Andrew Davis, director of The Fugitive (1993) and Under Siege (1992).While Collateral Damage may have suffered at the box office due to the events of September 11 2001, that aside it would not have made the slightest difference. The film was a disappointment, especially for Arnold Schwarzenegger.4\/10.
