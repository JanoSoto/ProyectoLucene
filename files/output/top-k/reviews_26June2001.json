By twisted, I mean that it isn't one of those films you expect everything to be clearly laid out in front of you in black and white. Very much like the time I saw The Sixth Sense, I was sitting on the seat saying to myself, So what's the fuss all about? Ok, the film had just started so I had now idea what to expect. But did only agree to watch cause people fussed about it. The said to me, Watch it, man! You'll worship it, afterwards!And quite predictable, as it seems, Fight Club evolved and developed into one of the most awe-inspiring films I've witnessed. It oozes with the essense of a superb film. It follows a plot format that every movie should follow, beginning with something quite ordinary and turning into a full blown opera of suberb acting, cinematography, lighting, and story telling. What also turned the movie into the gem it very much is, is the plot that is not so much complex but more taxing on the mind, so it doesn't leave the viewer like a stunned mullet, much like the absolute huge disappointment of Godzilla (1998).Edward Norton is perhaps is one the most talented actors of recent times and in his recent role in Keeping the Faith only statisfied thanks to his contribution to Fight Club. Norton plays Jack, our hero, who's life isn't going to great at this time. While trying to handle severe sleeping problems and attending a post-testicle cancer rehab group on false pretenses, he meets Tyler Durden (played by Brad Pitt)who together they start a fight club, to ease their troubled minds. Brad Pitt churns out a another dazling performance as the ever so convincing character of Tyler leads Jack into deeper and deeper trouble.The highlight of the movie is the approach to climax, where everything is revealed, in perhaps the greatest plot twist ever put to screen (well almost, though it's up there with The Sixth Sense). David Fincher movies always have had great plot twists, such as The Game and Se7en. His efforts as director ensure the beauty of this film and his magic touch leaves that tingling feeling as the credits begin to roll.Fight Club, may not be the movie for everyone. It may be too wierd. It may be too stupid. It may be that your not the one for those crazy pscyhcological-plot-twist flicks. For what ever reason you may or may not enjoy this, it is worth seeing it at least once for the experience. Fight Club is an extremely important landmark as pscyhcological thrillers go. I'm very sure Fight Club will become a movie classic alongside films like Se7en and The Game, in a era of mind game thrillers.

It turns out there are other curiosities about this man, and we get caught up in a mystery that takes some unexpected turns. Where the mystery ends up, I won't reveal, since that would spoil the plot -- I will say that it ends up in a very interesting place.However, that said, I have a number of problems with the execution of the movie. First of all, I didn't care for the directing style at all. Many of the scenes felt needlessly gimmicked or obfuscated. For instance, there was one scene where two characters are sitting in front of a TV talking to each other. Instead of seeing the characters directly, we see their reflections in the TV screen. I'm sure there's an artistic explanation for why he did that, but it felt goofy and pretentious to me -- like the director was trying too hard to do something different. In another scene, we see about 60 seconds of activity through billowing curtains from outside the room. Most of what you see is the curtains, with only glimpses of what is going on inside. Again, I'm sure it appealed to the artistic crowd, but I found it annoying and artificial. I've always felt that true artistry should not call attention to itself -- you shouldn't notice it until you watch the film a second or even third time. So the director was too present in how the scene was played out.Second, and much worse, many of the scenes were lethargic and slow. Long pauses were taken between the actors' lines -- far longer than required for a dramatic pause, far to frequently. Things felt slow through the entire movie. It was interesting in terms of the overall plot line, but the many of the individual scenes were utterly boring. I saw this movie for the first time on DVD (not in the theater), and more than once I almost reached for the remote and hit the fast forward button. I will say, it was interesting enough that I didn't actually hit the button; but the fact that I eyed the remote at least 5 different times speaks volumes. If it were a truly riveting movie, I wouldn't have been able to tell you where the remote *was*.Finally, while I won't reveal the ending or what happens in the climax, I will say it felt like not enough happened. After the movie was over, I said out loud to myself, That's it? It felt incomplete to me. Not in the way that screams sequel, because things are wrapped up, but the way in which they were wrapped up felt too quick. The way the general plot was structured, if you had read a 1-page treatment of the movie, you'd have said, Wow! I bet this final scene will be packed with power and emotion. While it was surprising, it was not powerful or emotional. It was rather slow and stale, which, sadly, is how the entire rest of the movie felt.Ultimately, Unbreakable was intellectually interesting, but emotionally empty. The performances were wooden.

First of all, I didn't care for the directing style at all. Many of the scenes felt needlessly gimmicked or obfuscated.

In another scene, we see about 60 seconds of activity through billowing curtains from outside the room. Most of what you see is the curtains, with only glimpses of what is going on inside. Again, I'm sure it appealed to the artistic crowd, but I found it annoying and artificial. I've always felt that true artistry should not call attention to itself -- you shouldn't notice it until you watch the film a second or even third time.

I saw this movie for the first time on DVD (not in the theater), and more than once I almost reached for the remote and hit the fast forward button.

If it were a truly riveting movie, I wouldn't have been able to tell you where the remote *was*.Finally, while I won't reveal the ending or what happens in the climax, I will say it felt like not enough happened. After the movie was over, I said out loud to myself, That's it? It felt incomplete to me. Not in the way that screams sequel, because things are wrapped up, but the way in which they were wrapped up felt too quick. The way the general plot was structured, if you had read a 1-page treatment of the movie, you'd have said, Wow! I bet this final scene will be packed with power and emotion.

Well, for starters you can watch the movie several times over and get something different out of it each time.  Let me just clarify that by saying that I'm not a person who watches it over and over because 'Lecter is the greatest character ever and I idolize him.'  I like the movie because of the extreme detail we see in character development, the cinematography, and the tension that's built up.  I can't sympathize with people who were shocked and horrified that Lecter would actually act the way he did in 'Hannibal.'  These people obviously never actually realized that he had been in that cell for a reason.Anyway, every character in this film (except maybe Dr. Chilton) is changed by the end of it.  And isn't that why we choose to show the sequence of events that unfold in a story?  Every character has a great arc that is logically followed and believable.  Clarice is a wonderful character, and you really understand how she could affect a psycho-path in the manner that she did.  Crawford is presented as an interesting foil to Lecter in that he is the other predominant male figure in Starling's life.  After the loss of her actual father, she seems to seek these father figures to help her through her life.  That is, until the end when she has grown enough to strike out on her own.As for getting more and more out of it with each viewing, to give you an example  I recently revisited the film and the scene where Lecter is in the actual cage came up.  As Clarice is being dragged out, he hands her the case file and, in the process, brushes his finger against hers.  That particular shot of their hands has always given me the creeps.  But I finally realized that it was 'The Birth of Man.'  The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel (please forgive my ignorance if I'm misspelling anything) depicts God bestowing life on Adam by touching his finger in a similar manner.  By handing Clarice the case file, Lecter is helping to save Catherine Martin's life.  She has taught him to care (even if it is only sometimes).  Now, maybe this wasn't the intent for the shot at all.  Or maybe it was the intent and it's so obvious that I'm a big dope for not having noticed it before, but I find these sorts of things every time I watch this movie.

I'm not sure where to start! I suppose the first thing that I did after I saw the premiere was scratch my head and ask myself, did I like this? It's certainly is not your run-of-the-mill type of movie; it's different and creative, taking you to places most movies don't go. I'm almost certain most people will either love it, or hate it, but few people in-between. (like me) If you liked the George Lucas THX movies, 12 monkeys, original Planet of the Apes, science fiction type of movies, then you're in for a real treat. Though don't venture to this one expecting heart-pounding action at every turn, there's quite a bit of a dramatic edge that can slow the movie down rather quickly.Perhaps this is the paradox. The audience was very mixed, older people who were looking for an interesting and compelling plot, and teens\/college people, looking for those fast-pace multi-million dollar computer generated graphic action sequences. When the movie combined both, I think it left a few people upset. Younger folks literally left the theater when it got too slow, and older people thought it was too crazy and unexpected when it picked up. I seriously thought it was several movies in one.If your asking me whether or not it's worth it to pay to see this in a theater, I would have to say yes, it's quite a unique experience even if you dislike it. It's one of those movies that stays in your mind for the rest of the day, leaving you pondering.A WORD OF WARNING Toward the end of this movie, certain sequences will give you the sensation that the movie is about to end. This happens like 20 times, but keeps on going, and going, and going. In reality the movie is like 2 1\/2 hours, which still is shorter than other big budget movies like Titanic and Braveheart.

If one starts to watch this movie wanting for sleep, one will quickly find same.The main premise of The Muse is that a slumping Hollywood screenwriter (Albert Brooks, who also directed and co-wrote the screenplay, as per usual for him) turns to a mysterious woman -- a muse (Sharon Stone) -- to help salvage his latest screenplay, not to mention his entire Hollywood career. The idea is that she is going to, somehow, thru some kind of magical and mystical conjuring, turn defeat for the poor sap into victory thru vegetables. With the help of a Waldorf Salad. Or something! Who knows?The biggest problem with The Muse is its ridiculous plot. No, not the fact that he would turn to a muse for help. That's the most believable part of the plot. What is truly unbelevable are the absurd extremes our friendly schmuck will go to in order to get and keep her on his side, so she will help him. Such as buying her a present from Tiffany, before he's even met her, thereby paying to her the initial homage. Such as putting her up in a deluxe $1,700.-a-night suite in the Four Seasons Hotel. Such as agreeing to stock her suite's refrigerator with food -- not from a plain old supermarket, mind you, but from a health food store. Such as agreeing to take her clothes to the cleaners for her (For $1,700. a night in a high-end hotel, wouldn't they have a concierge or somebody to take care of stuff like that?). Such as agreeing to be at her beck and call 24 hours a day -- for ANYTHING! And on and on.Added to all this is the idiot delight's wife (Andie MacDowell).

What an outdated and goofy concept for a movie!In the past, I was a big fan of Albert Brooks' films (generally speaking, of course). Just as I once was of Woody Allen's. Just as I once was of Mel Brooks'. Now Mel is way too old to do much of anything, Woody has become a caricature of a caricature of himself, and as for Albert, if The Muse can be used as any kind of guidepost, he seems to either be out of fresh ideas or, if he does come up with one, he can't figure out how to bring it to an entertaining fruition.Ironically, the screenplay in the plot of The Muse might very well have been the real-life screenplay for this movie.
