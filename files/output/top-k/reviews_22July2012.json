But it's a case where the movie's reputation slightly outstrips reality. It's one of those movies which isn't quite as good as people remember it as being. It won an Oscar for best screenplay but there's really nothing remarkable about the script. In fact the story is actually quite predictable and mundane, with some rather corny dialogue to boot. It's a movie which follows a well-worn formula, the underdogs striving to make good. And you can see the obstacles the main character will face, and the reasons for his eventual disillusionment, coming a mile away. There's never really any great drama, you know where the movie's headed.But just because the movie is predictable doesn't mean it can't be reasonably enjoyable. It's the story of four teens, just graduated high school and trying to find their path in life. But it's the story of one of the four which is at the heart of the film. Dave Stoller is obsessed with bicycle racing. Italian bicycle racing to be specific. He Italianizes his life, much to the consternation of his father. Meanwhile he and his directionless friends have run-ins with the college kids and it all comes to a head in a bicycle race. Well, points for originality there I suppose. Not many movies have a bicycle race as the big, dramatic climax. The movie is hailed as being truly inspiring. That's a stretch. But when the movie ends you'll probably at least find yourself smiling. It's not riveting stuff all the way through, there are plenty of lulls. The movie does do enough to keep you interested though. Dennis Christopher does an excellent job in the role of Dave. Paul Dooley, playing Dave's father, is also memorable. The tug-of-war between these two characters produces many of the movie's highlights. The supporting cast features now familiar faces such as Dennis Quaid, Daniel Stern and Jackie Earle Haley.

In much the same way that Sam Raimi kept his 'Evil Dead' series alive and interesting through every instalment by simply adding a new genre type to the mix, this film adds action to the basic sci-fi horror template. But it isn't done in a silly gimmicky way. The action angle is entirely justifiable within the context of the story where we have a Special Forces group return to the infamous planet in order to make war with the aliens. In fact, much like the original Predator, Aliens is a perfect amalgamation of the action, science fiction and horror genres.This was the first time that director James Cameron had been given serious money to make a movie. His previous film The Terminator had been very successful but was much lower budget. With Aliens he was able to indulge in the special effects heavy style that would go on to typify his career. Additionally, this one also displays Cameron's distinctive feminist leanings that almost all his other movies have, where we have a strong independent woman at the heart of an action movie. With these two angles of feminism and action, Cameron has been able to appeal to a very wide demographic of people, which partly explains his movies enormous financial successes. I would have to say that Aliens is probably the best Cameron ever got. Because while it displays all the above characteristics, it also contains an awful lot of brilliant and sinister ideas that form a part of the 'Alien' franchise. It's here where we first see the creatures attacking en mass, we also see the horrific human 'nests' for the first time (although the director's cut of Alien did include this later) and we also encounter the queen alien. All the ideas are brilliantly brought to the screen with excellent special effects. While the story itself, while lacking the intrigue of the original, is well paced and more than serviceable. It has the usual angle of the evil of the big business corporation having underhand goals that are completely at odds with the welfare of the crew, while it also brings in a new theme of motherhood where Ripley protects Newt against the Queen and her nasty brood.All-in-all, superior stuff.

It works from a 'real world', a historic one at that. But it's a good film because it's committed to clearly spin and align the different layers of self.The story is Faust, both the film and the play-within. Our film is about an actor who sells his soul for a gilded life on the stage, the play is where he is Mephisto - not Faust - and tries to reason with his decision to be Faust, and a third layer is about an era, Nazi Germany in the early years that was also about a Faustian bargain and staged images of power. The protagonist is an actor from the German stage and plays one. It has a Hungarian filmmaker at the helm who knows probably too well the type of life from the Eastern Bloc.So this succeeds where Hollywood's Cabaret felt contrived and false, because everyone is a step closer to the nervous soul of that world.Something is quite brilliantly handled here, and I believe it's this; one of the conceits of our actor, a leftist in the early days, is for a Peoples Theater that directly involves and agitates into action. Of course that's all gone when the Nazis come into power, with their Wagnerian notions on the ideal and the pure. He has to do Hamlet, the ambition however is still the same, a play that involves the audience, but in this environment seems ludicrous and hypocritical. It's a state-sponsored event after all. Now we see several excerpts of Faust, and more shots of our man backstage in pale Mephisto make-up acting the role in real life, but we never see Hamlet. We never see just how he intended this Peoples Theater.

No? Tom Green has already done that so don't even bother with such immoral suggestions. I don't hate shock humor but I detest attempts to use a feeble story to justify irrelevant acts of bestiality, child violence, and Tom Green stunts suitable for MTV reality shows. I excuse Jackass for their mind-boggling antics being that it is their careers to pull stunts like shooting fireworks near their butts. No story needed. But there comes a point in time when you must ask yourself during a movie What's the fu**ing point?Gord Brody (played by Tom Green) has goals of being a cartoon animator but the best job he can get is a job at a Hollywood cheese sandwich factory. Unsatisfied with his job and failed ambitions, Gord moves back to his parent's Portland home to continue his already annoying behavior. Very unbecoming of his antagonistic father (played by Rip Torn), who is the only character I could sympathize with for dealing with a black sheep. To our astonishment, Gord manages to score with a rocket scientist (played by Marisa Coughlan) who is wheelchair-bound and orgasms when having her legs whacked. So there you go, the basic points in this movie, the rest is about Tom Green performing unnatural, random crap. Oh, you want to know the meaning of the title? Fine. At some point, Gord decides to exact revenge on his dad for breaking one of his possessions. How? By falsely accusing him of sexually molesting Freddy (played by Eddie Kaye Thomas), Gord's younger adult brother. He's a full-grown man and he's sent to an institute for sexually-abused children. Do you want to know the sad part? The subject doesn't come up again.I'll make a couple of confessions in this review. First, I want to admit I love hating this movie so much. Second, just because I may laugh at some scenes doesn't mean I like, admire, or enjoy what I'm seeing. The only thing I genuinely laughed at was when Rip Torn cracked a cripple joke. I feel ashamed for it too. One last confession this is a movie which made me so mad I impulsively blurted F**k you near the end. I know you'll understand why after seeing the elephant.None of the stunts in Green's movie make logical sense to his character's objectives. Instead, we see the sporadic actions of an animal-abusing, spoiled, socially and mentally-retarded moron. God, I sound like Keith Olbermann but bear with me, please. Should I rig my fingers with sausages on strings while playing keyboard music to be more creative in this review? What may work for Gord may not work for me. From showering with scuba gear to swinging newborns by their umbilical cords, Gord's sickness doesn't deserve any pity and can only isolate viewers from rooting for him.If you think I'm going to be merely offended by broken teeth and animal masturbation, you got another thing coming. The cast generally has mean, heartless roles to support the dismal, annoying performance of Tom Green. His performance serves only one purpose it challenges us to deal with his immaturity for an hour-and-a-half. I honestly cannot name one performance that wasn't awkward, annoying, or embarrassing. And don't even go there with Rip Torn; you're more likely to laugh at him than with him.Even Green's direction sucks. Don't believe me? Look at the trailer of Gord in the factory with a cheese-helmet and you'll notice that the movie doesn't even show his stunt until we see him with a zoomed out shot of it on the conveyor belt. Instead, the scene plays out during the rolling credits. That's how lousy and inept this movie is. I'm impressed how the status of Green's movie has changed over time but it still won't affect my opinion. An awful movie is an awful movie. I really don't care if this movie has obtained a cult status or people understood Green was deliberately intent on destroying art, Freddy Got Fingered is the ultimate shame of comedic cinema if not one of the worst movies I have ever seen.My Rating 1\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 July 2012","score":"8 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" Tell me the last time you told your mother to be promiscuous or you whacked a horse off.

I feel ashamed for it too. One last confession this is a movie which made me so mad I impulsively blurted F**k you near the end. I know you'll understand why after seeing the elephant.None of the stunts in Green's movie make logical sense to his character's objectives. Instead, we see the sporadic actions of an animal-abusing, spoiled, socially and mentally-retarded moron. God, I sound like Keith Olbermann but bear with me, please. Should I rig my fingers with sausages on strings while playing keyboard music to be more creative in this review? What may work for Gord may not work for me. From showering with scuba gear to swinging newborns by their umbilical cords, Gord's sickness doesn't deserve any pity and can only isolate viewers from rooting for him.If you think I'm going to be merely offended by broken teeth and animal masturbation, you got another thing coming. The cast generally has mean, heartless roles to support the dismal, annoying performance of Tom Green. His performance serves only one purpose it challenges us to deal with his immaturity for an hour-and-a-half. I honestly cannot name one performance that wasn't awkward, annoying, or embarrassing. And don't even go there with Rip Torn; you're more likely to laugh at him than with him.Even Green's direction sucks. Don't believe me? Look at the trailer of Gord in the factory with a cheese-helmet and you'll notice that the movie doesn't even show his stunt until we see him with a zoomed out shot of it on the conveyor belt. Instead, the scene plays out during the rolling credits. That's how lousy and inept this movie is. I'm impressed how the status of Green's movie has changed over time but it still won't affect my opinion. An awful movie is an awful movie.

No? Tom Green has already done that so don't even bother with such immoral suggestions. I don't hate shock humor but I detest attempts to use a feeble story to justify irrelevant acts of bestiality, child violence, and Tom Green stunts suitable for MTV reality shows. I excuse Jackass for their mind-boggling antics being that it is their careers to pull stunts like shooting fireworks near their butts. No story needed. But there comes a point in time when you must ask yourself during a movie What's the fu**ing point?Gord Brody (played by Tom Green) has goals of being a cartoon animator but the best job he can get is a job at a Hollywood cheese sandwich factory. Unsatisfied with his job and failed ambitions, Gord moves back to his parent's Portland home to continue his already annoying behavior. Very unbecoming of his antagonistic father (played by Rip Torn), who is the only character I could sympathize with for dealing with a black sheep. To our astonishment, Gord manages to score with a rocket scientist (played by Marisa Coughlan) who is wheelchair-bound and orgasms when having her legs whacked. So there you go, the basic points in this movie, the rest is about Tom Green performing unnatural, random crap. Oh, you want to know the meaning of the title? Fine. At some point, Gord decides to exact revenge on his dad for breaking one of his possessions. How? By falsely accusing him of sexually molesting Freddy (played by Eddie Kaye Thomas), Gord's younger adult brother. He's a full-grown man and he's sent to an institute for sexually-abused children.

Jaws was so huge that it spawned merchandise, several sequels and actually scarred people out of the water. I'm sure the one's who knew what sharks are really like were just rolling their eyes at the reaction Jaws got and I think that's where Roger Corman(a God amongst Hollywood with the protégés he brought up) got the idea for Piranha. Despite not being a direct spoof of Jaws, you can tell that he was just having fun with the new genre of undersea monsters. Having some goofy lead characters with what is actually one of the most harmless most scary looking fish in the sea, you got Piranha.Two teenagers exploring at night come upon an apparently abandoned military installation. They take advantage of what appears to be a swimming pool to skinny dip. The teenagers are attacked by an unseen force and disappear under the water. A light activates in the main building and a silhouetted figure investigates the screams, but is too late to help. A determined but somewhat absent-minded insurance investigator, Maggie is dispatched to find the missing teenagers near Lost River Lake. She hires surly backwoods drunkard Paul Grogan to serve as her guide. They come upon the abandoned compound, which functioned as a fish hatchery prior to being militarized. They discover bizarre specimens in jars and indications of an occupant. Maggie locates the drainage switch for the outside pool and decides to empty it to search the bottom. The two find a skeleton in the filtration trap of the empty pool, and learn it was filled with salt water. They realize that the piranhas are heading for the town and they must stop the evil fish.The film has this often campy and fun feeling to it. Having the silly characters, clichés, gore and nudity is honestly just a lot of fun. This is an over looked horror film I think, it's just a good time. I remember this movie as a kid, my parents were skimming around the channels on Christmas and for some reason this movie was playing. We always joked that it was our new Christmas movie. I think I'll keep that tradition alive, after all, what isn't more about Christmas than killer piranhas? The attack scene at the lake is very gruesome and cool to watch with plenty of prop arms, legs and heads being chewed up with that creepy piranha chomping sound. I have to admit, for a fish that doesn't really attack humans, this made me a little creeped out by piranhas.Piranha is a good horror\/comedy that works and should be given a chance. I'm not sure why it's over looked, but it's a fun movie. I do warn, it's campy and the effects are not that special. The acting isn't anything to brag about either. But this is a horror movie that calls out all the silly clichés. Maybe it was the people who were afraid of Jaws that took this film too much to heart that they were being goofed on with their reactions.

Also, if anyone remembers the old Hollywood-type machoism that permeated their movies back then, you'll know what I am talking about. In both scenes in which one character is talking to his daughter and in another scene in which Lockwood's character is receiving a happy birthday call from his parents, the words I love you never were spoken. This is incredibly short-sighted and would never happen in real life but as I said, this was the Hollywood of real-men back then and it would most certainly not be eliminated in today's scripts.

Because it stands the test of time. The jokes remain funny, the plot remains silly, the characters still make us laugh, and it contains the greatest collection one-liners ever placed in a single film. Add in the best on film performances by Orlando Jones and pure comedy with David Duchovny, and you've got one well rounded film. Also, the special effects by Phil Tippett hold up better than most other films from that same year.There are comparisons to Ghostbusters and Men In Black that are just unfair to this film.

Basically actress and woman-about-town Claire Reine, who calls herself Garance (Arletty) has numerous men falling at her feet and in love with her, including the significant ill-fated relationship with theatre mime Jean-Baptiste Debureau (Jean-Louis Barrault), and also pretentious actor Frédérick Lemaîtr (Pierre Brasseur), conniving thief Pierre François Lacenaire (Marcel Herrand) and Count Eduard of Montray (Louis Salou). Baptiste has his own dilemma as well, as actress Nathalie (María Casarès) is in love with him, it was when Garance was accused of stealing a watch that she and he met, and Count Eduard protects her when she may have been arrested for the crime of Lacenaire. Years of separation for them, the real loving couple end up in relationships with the people they do not truly love, Baptiste with Nathalie who have a baby son together and goes on to become famous for his mime acting, and Garance with the Count and wants to find her true lover again. The couple do manage to spend a night together, even after Nathalie's attempt to sabotage their meeting by sending her child to foil it, while Count Eduard is discovered murdered, he was killed by Lacenaire. In the end Baptiste is separated from his love again after disappearing in the crowd who are running to escape an attack, and Garrance is forced to leave town in a carriage, completely oblivious to the fact that the Count is dead.

Basically Brian Sweeney 'Fitzcarraldo' Fitzgerald (Klaus Kinski) lives in South America and has a great passion for the opera, and he has a dream to build his own opera house in the exotic wilderness so that singers like Caruso, and Pucinni, and Wagner can be enjoyed in these parts. One night Fitcarraldo and his top brothel madam girlfriend Molly (Claudia Cardinale) arrive a little late for a local opera performance, and he manages to catch the attention of Don Aquilino (José Lewgoy), who is interested in financing this plan that the opera enthusiast has. The plan starts with Fitzcarraldo buying a boat with Molly's money, gathering together a small crew, and travelling up the Amazon River where they will head for an area of the jungle where Indiana inhabit, those who kill any white men who enter. They eventually reach the halfway point of the journey, and the tribe accept Fitcarraldo as some kind of God after hearing the music of Caruso, and they are happy to take the commands from the entrepreneur so he can realise his dream. The biggest test in the journey comes when there is a separation on the river to where the boat is heading, this is due to a set of small mountain hills, meaning that the Indians and crew members are forced to drag the one hundred and eighty pound barge over the leg. After this tiring task and the Indians have finished their slavery, the journey on the river continues, and soon runs into another dilemma where the rapids nearly damage the boat, but it ultimately survives the ordeal. In the end, after these hills are conquered, trees are cut down, and perilous waters, the boat reaches its destinations, and becomes the opera house that Fitzcarraldo had imagines, with the stars he loves so much performing their small show, and those that watch admire the wonderful performance, with the entrepreneur standing proud. Also starring Paul Hittscher as Paul the Captain, Miguel Ángel Fuentes as Cholo and Enrique Bohorquez as Huerequeque (The Cook). Kinski gives a great performance as the eccentric and very obsessive man with the love for opera and having his own opera house, the direction by Herzog is well paced, the most exciting scene is certainly the boat being pulled by the ropes up and down the muddy hill, but there is a lot to be enjoyed in this compelling period drama.

You can see why. Several gags, such as the spoof television commercial for 'Old Testament' cigarettes ( I smoke them...HE smokes them!, quips a priest, glancing upwards ), the honeymoon consummation scene which is shot like a televised boxing match, the trial scene which involves Miss America and J.Edgar Hoover disguised as a black woman, could have fitted into any one of the gang's pictures. 'Bananas' was only Woody's second film as director, the first being the seminal spoof documentary - yes, the genre existed before 'This Is Spinal Tap' - 'Take The Money & Run'. It stars our bespectacled hero as 'Fielding Mellish', a products tester who is incredibly unlucky when it comes to girls. Nobody wants to go out with him. He meets and falls for 'Nancy' ( Louise Lasser, Allen's real-wife wife at the time ), a political activist keen to end American aid to the banana republic of San Marcos in South America. They have had a revolution there, and the country is now being run by a dictator called 'Vargas'. When Nancy breaks off the relationship, Mellish flies to San Marcos to find her, only to get caught up in the counter-revolution, ultimately becoming its new President...As was the case with 'Run', this picture contains all of Allen's usual preoccupations - sex, death, human relationships. The gags come at you like bullets from a Gatling gun, some work better than others. My favourites include Mellish trying to buy a porno magazine, dealing with thugs on a subway train ( one of whom is played by a young Sylvester Stallone ), falling down a manhole as he gets out of his car, hurting his back during training with the rebels and being forced to crouch as he joins the queue for food, President Vargas thinking he has enlisted aid from the C.I.A. when in fact it is a Jewish organisation ( suddenly the streets of San Marcos are teeming with rabbis ), and Nancy telling Mellish that 'someone is missing' from their relationship. He asks what it is, and she does not know. He replies that if she does not know what it is, how does she know its missing? Woody has never made a secret of his love for the Marx Brothers' pictures, and their influence is evident. This hails from what what we might term his 'golden age' when, along with Mel Brooks, he was the best American comedy film maker around. Three films in similar vein followed - 'Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex But Were Afraid To Ask' ( 1972 ), 'Sleeper' ( 1973 ), and 'Love & Death' ( 1974 ) - before Allen decided to reinvent himself with 'Annie Hall' ( 1977 ).

It took me 3 attempts to finish this pile of garbage.My main problem is that it takes more than an hour for something interesting to happen. Then when you think things are gonna pick up, all Superman does is straighten the leaning tower of pisa. Just awful. The end, while good, doesn't make up for the terrible lead in. All in all, this movie had high expectations for me, as i loved the first two. But it fell flat completely. This is just too much of a parody, and I couldn't stand it. In fact, it was so bad for me, that I find myself enjoying Superman IV The Quest for Peace. Now that one doesn't deserve hate. It raised the bar a little after this mess.

When he appears in that apron, totally emasculated, I want to reach into the film and grab him by the lapels of his jacket and shake some sense into him. Apparently Jimbo wanted to do the same in that scene when he knocked the father out of his chair and begged him to be a man. She eats him up alive and he takes it! is the way Jim describes the relationship between his parents, and you begin to understand why he's the confused and alienated suburban youth of the Fifties, not because he's from a poor or racial family, but because there's no one he can connect with on any meaningful level.As good as the film is, I find I have some of the same reservations mentioned by other reviewers. I know the template for movies, and even TV shows of the Fifties, was to use older actors to play the part of teenagers, but the disparity here is overdone except in the case of Sal Mineo's Plato. I look around at teenagers of today, and I don't think they could have handled themselves with the likes of Buzz, Crunch and Moose hanging around. Funny, but I don't recall handles like that when I was a kid growing up in the Fifties, but I do remember a 'Slats', so I guess they were around.There's also the odd non-reaction when Buzz goes over the cliff during the chickie-run. Is it my imagination, or did no one express any horror over the event? Personally, this would have caused a big time freak out with any group I ever hung around with but it didn't cause that much of a sensation here. That didn't seem very believable to the extent that it failed to tie into the desperation that many of the teens in the picture seemed to be feeling.I like James Dean and like many others, I wish he hadn't died at such an early age. Imagine the output he could have produced based solely on the three memorable films he made his acting mark in. One of the original trailers for Rebel Without a Cause describes it as 'Entertainment of Unforgettable Emotional Impact'. Generally I find that to be pretty accurate as it deals with teenage angst that prevailed in the era of the late Fifties\/early Sixties. Things are certainly different today with a lot more distractions vying for young people's attention, but the need for understanding, love and friendship are timeless qualities that are brought home with this film, with a message that still has universal appeal.

It is pretty sad but even Plane Crazy had better animation and 10 times better story.I won't spoil the story but I will say this don't expect anything good from it. Songs were really bad, especially the first one. They had no real melody and the lyrics weren't any better.This film really stole ideas from Snow White. The clearest example are the birds. Their design, role and actions were a clone from Snow White's birds. I must say Princess Glory reminded me of Snow White very heavily (maybe because both were animated by Grim Natwick). Some of the characters' actions were just like the dwarfs' movements.Historically this is very a important film. Fleischers were Disney's last real rival and this was their first feature (and the second hand- drawn film in history). Now I understand why Fleischer studio was defunct by 1942.Don't watch this film if you look for a good film or entertainment. This film's worth is purely historical.
