[{"date":"17 March 2001","score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Nora Ephron shamelessly rehashes her other popular sap-fest, Sleepless in Seattle, which in turn was a shameless rehash of the great neo-classic When Harry Met Sally.Two quick pointsa) Tom Hanks is one of the most overrated actors in Hollywoodb) Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks repeatedly team up for hopelessly saccharine romances that never seem to work, mainly because of Hanks' complete lack of appeal.Fact I have rarely seen a Hanks film I liked. Splash, Bachelor Party, Philadelphia, Sleepless in Seattle, Cast Away to name a few. And those are just the decent ones; he's made a deluge of absolutely horrid films as well (can you say Joe Versus the Volcano? Turner and Hooch? Forrest Gump??). Here he's as unappealing as ever.So why do his movies make so much money? Simple the average movie-goer sees someone as useless as Hanks getting into Meg Ryan's bed and they figure 'if he can do it *anyone* can!' This film has few saving graces. Meg Ryan plays herself. She's hardly the world's greatest actress (and she'll never top her performances in When Harry Met Sally and Hurly Burly) but her smile could melt steel and her charisma carries her a long way. Also, three strong co-star performances helped to ease the pain of the rest of the poor acting. Always fabulous Jean Stapleton steals the show here; charming, elegant, well- spoken...she's simply a pleasure to watch. Indie-queen Parker Posey (who happens to be one of my fav actresses) also gives a great, though under-cut, performance. Steve Zahn is really amusing in his role as Ryan's slightly spaced-out employee. (Why Posey and Zahn decided to follow-up Suburbia with this film I'll never know...) And finally, the always amusing Dave Chappelle gave another solid performance and outshined Hanks in each of their scenes together.All in all, the supporting cast helped to make this film watchable, and some of the dialogue was quite clever. But the premise was generic, and when the sappiness started my teeth began to ache. (quote I wanted it to be you. I wanted it to be you so badly!!) Unfortunately, cheeze overcomes any hint of quality. 5\/10.
