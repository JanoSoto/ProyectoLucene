However they settled on David Fincher, who at the time had never directed a movie, this was a good choice as he had the right ideas for the movie. It is worth noting that throughout this review I am referring to the 2004 special edition release.The movie itself is relatively well paced and has the best characters in the trilogy. Which consists of 22 prisoners, (only about 14 of them get any good screen time), 2 guards and a medical officer and of course Ripley. My personal favourite character is Morse played by Danny Webb, as he is a smart-ass dick for most of the film, but becomes more humbled by the end. Other characters include Clemens, the doctor, and Dillon the de-facto priest of the prison. People complain that they are all bald English guys, but still, English guys are awesome. Also there are a few Americans anyway.The Alien is as deadly as ever because it can now run like a cheetah and is quadrupedal, the effects used for the most part are spot on with suit effects being the effect used; however when the Alien is running, a rod puppet is used which looks like crap in some shots. Ellen Ripley is at her wits end in this film as she has lost everything and is now stuck with the scum of the earth on a distant planet with another Alien, Sigourney Weaver plays Ripley as good as ever and does not falter.A common criticism of the film is the fact that all the survivors of the previous film,(Aliens), are immediately killed off and there is a particularly gruesome autopsy on Newt, this is difficult to watch and really shouldn't have been included. I view this as the saddest and the funniest of the Alien films as some scenes are genuinely funny and other have me at tears. FYI this is the only film that makes me cry.The set design is spot on and the sculptors really captured the run down look of this prison facility very well, it certainly suits the trend with the other 2 Alien films. I've never seen a film make the colour brown look so appealing as it does in this movie, as everything is lit in the latter colour. The use of low angles is also a welcomed addition, plus we also get to see some Alien POV shots which increase the tension.To conclude, this film may not be as good as the first 2 Alien films, but it is a damn good film anyway and it does come close to being as good as them. If you can get over character deaths and a slightly downbeat film (which actually has a hopeful end) give this film a watch, you won't regret it.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 January 2014","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" WARNING SOME SPOILERSIt is no secret that Alien 3 had an extremely troubled production, with many writers and directors being hired and then cast aside.

He's the brainchild behind such half-wit nonsense as St. Elmo's Fire, Falling Down, Dying Young, and that crappy Mr. T vehicle D.C. Cab. You should know that I hated ALL of these movies. Schumacher takes the P.T. Barnum approach by attempting to approximate his movie toward the marketing department. You can see every piece of this movie hanging on a shelf at a toy store.All of the attempts by Tim Burton to pull the series away from the campy 60s TV series in his two previous films are undone here. Schumacher is determined to go for a hokey jokey kind of entertainment by giving us, among other things, sexual innuendo and dialogue that can easily be quoted in a TV ad. Burton's production team attempted to turn Gotham City into a real place, but Schumacher's film makes it look like a hideous all-night dance club with neon lights, pink lasers and Dutch tilts. It's like a variety show that you can't turn off.Yet, among the many crimes that Schumacher commits in Batman Forever, the worst is moving The Caped Crusader into the realm of fetishism. It's unnerving. The rubber suits worn by Batman and Robin are supplied with close-ups of their capes, masks, gloves, butts and little nipples on the batsuit. This, it seems, is in place of having any kind of real character psychology to deal with. That psychology is dealt with around the film's edges by a psychiatrist called Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) who is suppose to delve into Bruce's darkest heart, but seems at all times to be aiming at his codpiece. The relationship is a tease. Their dialogue is made up almost exclusively of sexual innuendo, and seems to have only been provided to assure us that the homoeroticism is only skin deep.The story is a generic Batman plot in which The Caped Crusader finds himself under the gun of two nefarious villains who want to drain Gotham City's collective I.Q. with a silly device hooked to the television sets of the entire population. On one side is Two-Face, a half-scarred former lawyer played by Tommy Lee Jones. On the other is Jim Carrey as The Riddler in a role that keeps him talking and talking and talking and talking for nearly two hours.Batman, this time, is played by Val Kilmer who does a serviceable job in a role that is difficult to play, especially with this script. Yet, there's something stagnant in his performance. He's all wrong for Batman. In his earlier career, Kilmer proved himself to be an adept comedian in films like Top Secret and Real Genius. That makes me think that he might have been better equipped to play one of Batman's villains, The Riddler, perhaps.Alas, that role is given to Jim Carrey who might have made a better Joker. Carrey, at his best, is a brilliant comedian, a physical performer whose best work is a marvel of comic timing so natural that it seems to land on him like an afterthought. The Riddler is not one of his great performances; in fact it's Carrey at his worst. Cut loose with a flimsy script, Carrey is given free reign over his performance and that's exactly the wrong approach. He isn't bringing anything original, he's just repeating the Ace Ventura formula in a green suit. He needs a script, a character, a plot, and some rules to contain his comedy. The Riddler is a consummate schemer who uses his clever puzzle games to keep Batman guessing. Carrey plays him like a monkey on steroids. A little of his act goes a long LONG way.Carrey's act is far from the worst thing about Batman Forever. I am simply dismayed by the how bland and generic the whole enterprise is.

However, recently I decided to re-watch a lot of Classics that I watched at a younger age. Movies like Gone with the Wind, Crash, Avatar, Vertigo, Rear Window, the movies I watched as a kid and liked (Except for Rear Window, for some odd reason) but I never considered the best. While I haven't gotten to the movies I just listed yet, I did manage to sit down and watched Orson Welles's masterpiece, Citizen Kane. And you know what? I finally got it.Everything about the movie made me feel something. There were scenes filled with energy, filled with emptiness, filled with tragedy, it really does take you through the full scope of such a successful man's life, and even though Charles Foster Kane himself can sometimes be arrogant, egotistical, and downright terrible, you don't feel justice when he fails. You feel sympathy. But why? Because in the end, through his ups and downs, he's a human being. He has emotions, he has flaws, he has likable traits, he's extremely fleshed out throughout the film, and while he may not be the most enjoyable, suave, or likable character, he certainly is one of the best in film history.Another thing I feel is worth discussing is the ending. Everybody knows it, thanks to Family Guy feeling it was humorous to spoil it for no other reason just to do so, as well as basically every review mentioning it. So don't go any further unless you already seen the film. So, throughout the film, news reporters are eager to find the meaning to a famous millionaire's final word, Rosebud (Which before anyone throws that plot-hole in my face, I just go with the theory that he said it loud enough for the nurse outside to hear). At first, they believe it's a girl, possibly one of the many that he's dated throughout his life. This is understandable, as the millionaire, Mr. Kane, is famous for being around women.However, in the end, Rosebud is not a woman, or anything anyone thought it would be. Rosebud was in fact, his childhood sled. Earlier in the film, we see Charles as a young boy, with his sled, which at this point, we don't know its name. Charles is taken away from his mother at a young age to get an education, leaving his sled, his home, and his childhood behind.His parents had sent Charles away to become rich, and leave behind his poverty in which he grew up in. However, as Charles dies, he looks into a snow-globe, and with his final word, he remembers a time in which he was truly happy. Sure, he became rich and famous, but it would be entirely possible that in the end, he would have been happier if they decided to just let him play in the snow.So in the final scene, you see the sled thrown into a fire, merely junk in everyone's eyes. It was an old sled to them, but to Charles Foster Kane, it symbolized loss of innocence, similar to Lord of the Flies, with the children becoming barbaric, mimicking the world they lived in, and by the end, they cry for the loss of their innocence, as instead of being shielded from the violence like the evacuation intended, they embraced it.Orson Welles is fantastic, displaying power and greed, but also bolstering an ego. He also did a good job depicting the different ages of his character, with his make-up helping as well. The other actors do a great job as well, and while some of them were a bit hammy, it definitely matched the personalities of the characters they were portraying.I could go on and on about what makes the film fantastic, the film is shot gorgeously, with both the camera-work and the sets matching the mood of the scene, the editing is extremely modern and keeps the film flowing at a good pace, and the film knows when music should be played, and when the scene should be silent, something a lot of films from the 30's and 40's fail at doing. But in the end, it would just be me reinstating how fantastic the film is, which I really don't think should be repeated, as I believe you get the picture by this point.So, is this my favorite film? Well, it's tough to say, but I think it's just barely worse than Lawrence of Arabia, though that may have been for the bird scene in Citizen Kane, which, like the car scene in Tarkovsky's Solaris, it felt like a fourth wall gimmick to me. But when I'm comparing a film to something like Lawrence of Arabia, it's hard to come up with favorites. I guess that's why I list off my favorites rather than usually picking one. But I'm getting off topic here. Citizen Kane is a powerhouse of a film, the type of film that doesn't happen often, but the type of film that not only inspires all to come, but still manages, among the clichés it creates and amount of people who have the film spoiled for them, to remain fresh and new to all who watch it.

He has emotions, he has flaws, he has likable traits, he's extremely fleshed out throughout the film, and while he may not be the most enjoyable, suave, or likable character, he certainly is one of the best in film history.Another thing I feel is worth discussing is the ending. Everybody knows it, thanks to Family Guy feeling it was humorous to spoil it for no other reason just to do so, as well as basically every review mentioning it. So don't go any further unless you already seen the film. So, throughout the film, news reporters are eager to find the meaning to a famous millionaire's final word, Rosebud (Which before anyone throws that plot-hole in my face, I just go with the theory that he said it loud enough for the nurse outside to hear). At first, they believe it's a girl, possibly one of the many that he's dated throughout his life. This is understandable, as the millionaire, Mr. Kane, is famous for being around women.However, in the end, Rosebud is not a woman, or anything anyone thought it would be. Rosebud was in fact, his childhood sled. Earlier in the film, we see Charles as a young boy, with his sled, which at this point, we don't know its name. Charles is taken away from his mother at a young age to get an education, leaving his sled, his home, and his childhood behind.His parents had sent Charles away to become rich, and leave behind his poverty in which he grew up in. However, as Charles dies, he looks into a snow-globe, and with his final word, he remembers a time in which he was truly happy. Sure, he became rich and famous, but it would be entirely possible that in the end, he would have been happier if they decided to just let him play in the snow.So in the final scene, you see the sled thrown into a fire, merely junk in everyone's eyes. It was an old sled to them, but to Charles Foster Kane, it symbolized loss of innocence, similar to Lord of the Flies, with the children becoming barbaric, mimicking the world they lived in, and by the end, they cry for the loss of their innocence, as instead of being shielded from the violence like the evacuation intended, they embraced it.Orson Welles is fantastic, displaying power and greed, but also bolstering an ego. He also did a good job depicting the different ages of his character, with his make-up helping as well. The other actors do a great job as well, and while some of them were a bit hammy, it definitely matched the personalities of the characters they were portraying.I could go on and on about what makes the film fantastic, the film is shot gorgeously, with both the camera-work and the sets matching the mood of the scene, the editing is extremely modern and keeps the film flowing at a good pace, and the film knows when music should be played, and when the scene should be silent, something a lot of films from the 30's and 40's fail at doing. But in the end, it would just be me reinstating how fantastic the film is, which I really don't think should be repeated, as I believe you get the picture by this point.So, is this my favorite film? Well, it's tough to say, but I think it's just barely worse than Lawrence of Arabia, though that may have been for the bird scene in Citizen Kane, which, like the car scene in Tarkovsky's Solaris, it felt like a fourth wall gimmick to me. But when I'm comparing a film to something like Lawrence of Arabia, it's hard to come up with favorites. I guess that's why I list off my favorites rather than usually picking one. But I'm getting off topic here. Citizen Kane is a powerhouse of a film, the type of film that doesn't happen often, but the type of film that not only inspires all to come, but still manages, among the clichés it creates and amount of people who have the film spoiled for them, to remain fresh and new to all who watch it.

However, recently I decided to re-watch a lot of Classics that I watched at a younger age. Movies like Gone with the Wind, Crash, Avatar, Vertigo, Rear Window, the movies I watched as a kid and liked (Except for Rear Window, for some odd reason) but I never considered the best. While I haven't gotten to the movies I just listed yet, I did manage to sit down and watched Orson Welles's masterpiece, Citizen Kane. And you know what? I finally got it.Everything about the movie made me feel something.

During a dirt bike race, Ed Harley's kid gets in the way and is inadvertently killed in the process. Seeking vengeance, Ed Harley goes to an old witch, to conjure up a demon known as Pumpkinhead to kill the kids. Not only does Ed Harley have a telepathic relationship with Pumpkinhead, but he begins to regret conjuring him up in the first placeI'm not among the general consensus of considering this a good horror movie. In all honesty, I thought it was rather boring. It has good use of location, decent atmosphere, along with a solid performance from Lance Henriksen. My major problem with this movie is the setup is not nearly as riveting as it likes to believe it is. It doesn't take advantage of the immense potential that it has. I would have liked to see a bit of a longer movie. More build up of frustration, pain and angst from Henriksen's character would have done this movies wonders. At around 80 minutes or so, it feels rushed and far too short to maximize on things like it should. The creature is actually extremely well done. Not only is it intimidating, but creepy as well.

My major problem with this movie is the setup is not nearly as riveting as it likes to believe it is. It doesn't take advantage of the immense potential that it has.

He responded I'd like to do a definitive study of segregation, from the Negro's point of view. Several years later Sterling would write Planet of the Apes, soon turned into a 1968 film by Franklin Schaffner. A giant what if the shoe were on the other foot? parable, the film finds a chauvinistic American astronaut (Charlton Heston) stranded on a planet ruled by apes. Here he's forced to experience racial discrimination of a type once reserved for blacks.Much of Planet of the Apes consisted of a hierarchical society of monkeys, apes and gorillas enslaving and persecuting white humans, actions which they justify along bio-genetic lines. Ironically, though it was intended to show support for African Americans, Planet came under attack from activists and black leaders. The film, some argued, re-inscribed racial conflict as species conflict (black\/monkey vs white\/human), and hinged on physical difference as the point of struggle. The film also played into issues of skin-colour hierarchy, making lighter apes more intelligent than their darker, more uncivilised counterparts. Others would argue that the film endorsed various racist interpretations of biological evolution; the belief that Africans are closer to animal than man, and that primates occupy the border zones between mythic poles. In this view, apes and Africans are liminal creatures, simultaneously like and unlike human beings, located between nature and civilisation, origin and destination. These contradictions have led to the film being labelled either well-meaning or reactionary, pandering to white fears of black uprisings and loss of racial dominance. This, after all, was a period of time in which some believed that black liberation struggles would threaten the security of white racial hegemony.Regardless, Charlton Heston is fittingly cast as our white hero. Heston made a career starring in epics in which Western and non-Western interests collide. In Gunfighter Nation The myth of the frontier in 20th century America, for example, cultural historian Richard Slotkin states that the typical Heston character was a hard and self-willed White male hero, an ultra conservative who stands for the highest values of civilisation and progress but who is typically besieged from without by non-white savages who greatly outnumber him and beset from within by the decadence, corruption and softness of his own society. Indeed, in the sixties Heston seemed to be perpetually fighting to defend an outpost on the margins of Western civilisation from barbaric onslaughts (The Naked Jungle, El City, 55 Days at Peking, Khartoum etc).Planet of the Apes was brilliantly directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, who treats us to some wonderful widescreen photography and a couple fine action sequences. Its sequel was Beneath the Planet of the Apes, directed by Ted Post. Filled with apocalyptic imagery (lots of radiation, nuclear war, disease), the film portrayed its society of apes, the winners in a war between monkey and man, as having become as classist, racist, warmongering and destructive as white humans. Rod Sterling's metaphors are henceforth complicated; both the white man and ape at different points of the franchise's time-line represent both white hegemony and persecuted blacks. Apes, we then learn, were once slaves to humans, just as humans are now slaves to apes. The first two films in the franchise also hinge on a big secret the ape society is covering up the fact that human civilisation existed before ape civilisations and that apes are descended from humans. The implication, depending how literally you regard the film's dubious ape\/minority metaphors and reversals, is that whites shamefully regard themselves as having evolved from blacks.The next film in the franchise, Escape from the Planet of the Apes sees a group of intellectual apes travelling back in time. They arrive on Earth, where they are abused by a paranoid military industrial complex which kills them all, except for one ape child, Caesar.J. Lee Thompson's Conquest of the Planet of the Apes followed. The best sequel in the franchise, the film sees a now adult Caesar leading a revolution (based on the Watts race riots) against a humanity which is attempting to turn apes into slaves. Significantly, Caesar's army of apes learns to talk. Their first word is no, a command which refers to the apes' abhorrence of weapons and violence. Next came Battle for the Planet of the Apes, again directed by Thompson. Here, within a post-nuclear society, an ageing Caesar struggles to combat ape factions which want to wipe out all of humanity. Caesar, in contrast, fights for peaceful coexistence. Caesar wins, leading to a long period of peace between man and monkey.So each ape film film is built around the conflict between a racially dominant oppressive group and a racially subordinate oppressed group seeking survival, harmony or reversal of domination. Each film also presents mediating figures &#x96; typically marginalised and at odds with the oppressing group - who intervene in the conflict, challenge systems and act as advocates of harmony. The advocates of peace rarely prevail and hostility always results in apocalyptic violence.The ape franchise would be rebooted in 2011 with Rise of the Planet of the Apes. A post-racial film, Rise's cast is filled with a cocktail of African Americans, whites and Indo-Americans. For the first time in the franchise, metaphor is replaced by literalism. Here, literal apes are literally rebelling against the literal animal cruelty (chemical testing) directed against them by literal scientists. Typically (mis?)read in light of post-financial crisis protests, the film ends with apes, led by Caesar, escaping their cages for the trees of local forests. Here, segregation is in everyone's best interest and Caesar concludes that separation is natural. The apes, now free, have returned to their correct, natural and separate place. For now.8\/10 - Worth two viewings.

What I dig about, is it's intriguing storyline. Surviving a mass cult suicide, beautiful, innocent, virtuous Cynthia, Jennifer Rubin, wakes up after a thirteen year coma, (apparently we learn the longest is 37 years). She starts off her recovery in a mental ward, still clinging to her dead friends, one big happy family at the beautiful Unity Fields, out yonder, where they swallow all of that, you know. And one thing you'll never forget about Unity Fields, the devoted cult leader, Harris, played by the evil faced, Richard Lynch, an ugly Rutger Hauer'ish looking guy, the one true acting standout in this. Cynthia strikes up a kind of relationship, with her principal psychiatrist, Alan (Bruce Re-animator Abbott) the only one who really agrees this is the wrong environment for her. Cynthia's sanity isn't really helped, or convincing to others of the medical field, when starts seeing things, mainly a resurrected Harris, who keeps reappearing, sometimes in not the most the healthy states. Or poor young Cynthia could be delusional. And why are the patients, suiciding, one by one, some of them in pretty gruesome ways, a couple making a death pact, choosing to go through a mini turbine creating a blood shower, as you will. Is it Harris, taking them, for Cynthia not holding up her end of the bargain. I don't want to give anymore more away, just to say, Bad Dreams works just as well as a horror as it does a thriller. The familiar actors, though you would have to be more of a eighties type to know 'em, give their mentally unbalanced characters, spark and oomph, especially Dean Cameron, a comedic asset to this slick horror, that will surprise and appease gore hounds who hasn't vide'd this one. Harris Yulin, an acting treasure again gives a fine, performance, as a shady veteran shrink. You wouldn't think this film of b grade appeal, barely making a showing at the cinema back in 88, would surprise you with such an effortful storyline, but Bad Dreams does, it's title indeed one of sarcasm. It's a short nifty horror, that's bloody entertaining, especially thanks to that handful of patients, and Harris.

This film is not made to entertain, but to awe and inspire. This film not only knows how to tell such an amazing story, but this film is widely recognized for it's visual effects. Even in today's computer digital age, I was very impressed. The special effects added a whole new dimension to as what we know as film today.

Keir Dullea is practically the only person we get to know and he does a pretty good job. He does lots of interacting with HAL and is crucial to the important man vs. machine part of the film.Overall, this is nothing short of perfect. I'm sad there are not any films like this one being made too often. This is a space opera, a mini-horror film, and an awe-inspired film combined in one. The scene involving Keir traveling through the wormhole is just one of the greatest. If you have love for cinema, this should be on the top of your list. It pains me to say that this film will easily bore the average movie-goer, but this is a true work of art. I rate this film 10\/10.
