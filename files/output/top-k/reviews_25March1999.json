[{"date":"25 March 1999","score":"","review":"  Rushmore is that kind of movie you just don't see enough of. In fact, it is kind of difficult to put a finger on, but from the opening until the end I had a smile on my face. Without a doubt, Rushmore is in my top 5 favorite flicks of the year. Rushmore was fantastic! I laughed more than I have in a long time. The key is that you have to appreciate dry, subtle, and deadpan humor. I assume you have all seen the film, so you know how great the whole Bill Murray poolside scene is. These kind of sight gags are what separate Rushmore from all the other comedies out there. The acting is superb, and the characters' idiosyncrasies are what make them so lovable. Max Fischer is blessed with a confidence many only dream of, and we become convinced that he could do anything he sets his mind to. The soundtrack is great too, having dug up many long forgotten british invasion groups that fit the film perfectly, like the kinks and 4+2. And Bill Murray deserves recognition for his performance. In short, I think that the majority of the US public has been subjected to low class, base, toilet humor for far too long, as is evident by those who hated this film or don't have the mental capacity to understand humor beyond fart jokes and semen in a woman's hair. Just look, There's ....Mary was a box office bonanza, while Rushmore is out of theaters in one month.That should tell you where America is at, and it should scare you too. Us Rushmore lovers need to stick together. For everyone else, it shouldn't be long before Adam Sandler cranks out another piece of garbage to quench your thirst.
