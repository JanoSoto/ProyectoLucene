I had always been a fan of Peter Jackson and when I heard he was making these films I immediately thought-gore, humour, gore, well-executed set pieces, and strong imagination. Although the amount of blood has been toned down it is still present in the Jackson trademark style, along with all his other traits. With this series Jackson has created the defining movies of this generation.A brief introduction is given by Galadrial, a powerful elf telling of the history of Middle-Earth and of the Ring. We learn of its terrible power and desire, and the tone is set for the entire series. We then travel to the Shire, a peaceful, idyllic place signifying all that is good in the world. The inhabitants are creatures called Hobbits, a race which usually keeps itself to itself, farmers with little thought for what lies beyond what they see. However, a few of them have a taste for adventure. Bilbo Baggins, on the eve of his birthday is writing a biography of sorts about his past trials and adventures involving the Ring. His young nephew Frodo has loved hearing Bilbo's stories, and often yearns to experience a more exciting life. The town gets together to celebrate, Bilbo's old friend Gandalf the Grey, a Wizard has also come. When Bilbo disappears, the town is confused and Gandalf becomes worried-The Ring has been awakened and is trying to find its way back to Sauran, its master who will bring a dark age upon the world. Eventually Gandalf finds the Ring and gives it to the reluctant Frodo. He is told of its power, and of the dangerous quest he must go on. The Black Riders are searching for it, and Frodo must leave the Shire. Along for the journey come his gardener and friend Sam, and two local, mischievous hobbits, Merry and Pip. After a while and many trials they reach the Elf Council who decide the Ring must be taken to Mordor and destroyed forever. Morder is the darkest, most evil place in the land, guarded by thousands of terrible creatures, but Frodo accepts the task. His friends will join him, along with Aragorn a human, Gimli a dwarf, Boromir a human, and Legolas an elf. Together they form the fellowship of the ring, and begin their long adventure.Not only is Fellowship one of the most spectacular and effects filled films ever, it is full of luscious, real scenery. The cinematography alone is a strong reason for watching. However, it is the story which takes central stage, the interaction between the characters inviting a yearning sense from the audience to be part of their team. Every performance from the huge cast is impressive, and there are many exciting, funny, scary, and sad moments. Each character has their own story and feelings as they all try to support Frodo. The attention to detail is stunning, the sets, wardrobe and battle scenes are all immaculate. The fights are some of the best in recent memory, and for sheer size only the sequels and Star Wars prequels can match them. In fact the only let down is the music; it is decidedly average for a film of such huge emotional scope and there is really only one memorable track.

A main credit to the movie lies in the cinematography, with plenty of beautiful shots of a nocturnal New York. The screenplay is not wholly convincing, since it seems more suited to the stage than to cinema. I mean, all the characters are so ready and brilliant in their dialogs, exactly like in a stage-play. We may expect a sharp wit from Hunsecker (Burt Lancaster), since to be witty is his job. But what about, say, the cigarette-girl? Or the straightforward wife of the non-corrupt journalist? Some lines, the like of I love this dirty city, are dated, to say the least. Hunsecker's morbid, psychotic love toward his sister is the crux of the film, but it remains somehow unexplained. My guess is that he is eager to preserve her virginity as the unique pure thing in a corrupt world... But who knows? Sometimes he seems to love his own power more than his sister. An interesting character, no doubt. Tony Curtis shines in his trade-mark role of the good-looking cheater, sleazy and greedy womanizer. Here we have the drama-version of the character, and I liked it, although I prefer Tony's comedy-version in masterpieces like Some like it hot or Operation petticoat. Actually, Sidney Falco is the most hateful character ever played by Curtis. Burt Lancaster is very good, although slightly over-the-top. All the cast makes a fine job. Such an overwhelming power of the gossip columnist Hunsecker as shown in the movie seems unlikely, not only today but even in the late 1950s. The movie presents some more or less subtle political messages which, honestly, I didn't appreciate. And I was even more displeased discovering that Hunsecker's character was based on a real person (allegedly, at a time when he had already lost his power). Not very elegant stuff out of authors devoted to condemn in the movie writers stabbing people in the back... I am not sure to like much Sweet smell of success (in fact, I don't like the title, either). However it is certainly an exciting and interesting movie, worth to be viewed.

So if you don't think a film was great (as in it was okay) they immediately decide that it was bad, especially if it's predecessor was considered great.Like Episode I, this film flawed, good but flawed. Gone are the days of boring pretentious court room scenes, but they are replaced with new cracks in the armor.The love story could have been beautiful if not for the fact that the dialogue is so cloying. Although it doesn't affect the movie in full since it only primarily appears in scenes between Anakin and Padme, this may be a throw back to old romance movies that Lucas grew up with, such as the couple rolling around in the grass. Lucas has done many throwbacks and referenced films he grew up with, here it didn't work.My assessment from my last review proves correct, Jar-Jar has been downsized to a representative of Naboo. He appears, then leaves, then appears again for a moment, then leaves, small doses work very well.Then comes the casting of Hayden Christensen, while he isn't as bad of an actor as Jake Lloyd, who portrayed Anakin Skywalker in Episode I. Christensen has very expressive eyes, and I can welcome him into the part because of his resemblance of both Luke Skywalker and Jake Lloyd's Anakin. It's when he opens his mouth that I lose my admiration of his acting ability.He seems to lack confidence in himself and his ability to say Lucas' words, even though they may be corny his lack confidence can also be seen in Shattered Glass as well. Mark Hamill originally said that while he was doing his first reading for Luke Skywalker he thought Who talks like this? to compensate he just read it sincerely.

Since it is not necessarily as great as the original films, but I prefer this film over Episode I tremendously, simply because I would rather take corny scenes and fun scenes over boring scenes and fun scenes.

While I don't think the film is one of Disney's best, I still believe it should be given a legitimate DVD release - but I can understand Disney's reluctance to do so. Having recently viewed the film, I can see that it is something of an embarrassment due to the dated racial elements in the movie, which is an unfortunate aspect of just about any pre-1960 film involving black people in the south. Many people here have said that the film should not be considered racist because it presents positive portrayals of blacks. Racism is not always negative. Any racial stereotype can be considered racist - even positive images. Consider, for instance, the racial stereotype of the Asian who excels at math. This is a positive image, but can still be as damaging as a negative one. Why? Because it reduces the race and culture to a patronizing false image that limits society's view of that race and makes broad assumptions about everyone that is a part of that race or culture. In other words, it encourages and reinforces ignorance. It tends to dehumanize its subject, even though that is not the intention.Yes, although well meaning, Song of the South qualifies as racist. But so does much of great US cinema prior to the civil rights movement of the '60s. This includes films like Gone with the Wind, Green Pastures, Birth of a Nation, and aspects of other Disney films (Dumbo has been mentioned). These films are not\/should not be banned, but instead be presented in a historical light, noting that times and attitudes have changed, and there is no reason why Song of the South shouldn't join these films with a legitimate release. Disney will probably not do it anytime soon, because they are sensitive to the race issue. Call it bowing to PC, if you want to, but there are good reasons for a great many people to be offended by the portrayal of blacks in this film (I am more embarrassed than offended), and their objections should not be dismissed lightly. But Song of the South is a film of its time, complete with naive views of race relations in the South, and there is no reason why Disney's artistry should suffer because of this. I just think Disney hasn't yet figured out the right way to market this film today, and calling them PC cowards and railing against the NAACP is not the way to get them to change their minds.

However that did not stop Hollywood from doing a follow up film, nor did it stop the Lutz's either, who later commissioned author John G. Jones to write a fictional sequel called THE AMITYVILLE HORROR PART II, a book that Hollywood thankfully discarded & instead decided to adopt HANS HOLZER'S (Who's wrote several novels on the infamous house) novel MURDER IN AMITYVILLE, based more closely on the incidents that occurred to the DeFeo family.What should be noted is how different in tone & structure AMITYVILLE II is in comparison to the original movie, it takes a much more darker, sleazier, trashier approach more similarly akin to a Euro trash sleaze film than a haunted house film. Although admittedly it does at times try make a actual drama based on the actual events & even includes brief elements of a court drama with Sonny's lawyer trying to get him off on a plea of demonic possession. It's approach is radically different when compared to that of it's predecessor, which was more or less structured as a slow burning horror film, done in the style of a made for TV movie, even though it was a theatrically released feature, it was done in the style of a documentary that mainly recounted the happening to the Lutz for the twenty eight days they were living inside the infamous house & discarded any kind of real film structure. While this should have made AMITYVILLE II a disaster, the surprising fact is the change in tone does not! Not only is the film more engrossing, it's faster paced & delivers tons of weird moments as well as great monster make-up & special effects, an eerie score by returning composer LALO SCHIFRIN (Who also performed the score for THE EXORCIST, a film which this film seems to emulate, especially in the latter half). Director DAMIANO DAMIANI manages to deliver a series of cool shots & weird angles & manages to keep his viewer engrossed in the characters & situations. The script by former John Carpenter protégé TOMMY LEE WALLACE although billing itself as a prequel, actually is only partially based on a true story. While the characterization remains close to the actual DeFeo family members, for the most part their names are changed from the DeFeo's to the Montelli's, no doubt done so they wouldn't have to pay to use the real story, several things have been changed from the DeFeo story in order to make it copyright free Sonny has been turned into a possessed maniac who slaughters his family while they are awake & roaming around the house, wherein the real life case had it that they were sleeping in their beds when DeFeo killed them. The number of kids the DeFeo's parents had (five in total) has been parred down to four, therefore the film despite it's prequel status, kind of messes with the continuity of the first film, which said their were five people killed two parents & four kids & the flashback sequences where we seen DeFeo kill his family as they slept. The family here is very well written & the story very engrossing, with some interesting tid bits dropped on the family it is implied that the father may have been trying to rape his wife one evening, that & the fact that this despicable character has no problem beating his kids or slapping his wife around. Unlike the original which also was based on a true story, AMITYVILLE II surprisingly keeps the viewer in suspense, even though they know the fate of these characters & the reason being is because so much of the facts have been changed, that you're actually curious to see how the murders will be pulled off. The film touches off on many interesting & somewhat controversial topics, such as incest, as we see Sonny set to have sex with his own sister, after being taken over by the demonic entity that lived in the house (Though admittedly there is noticeably a very light implication of incest between the two oldest siblings before the possession). Leaving the viewer wondering where the film is going to go next, since no taboo seems to be off limits by the film-makers. What should be noted is how the murders occur close to an hour in, when you're expecting them to occur at the every end. Instead after the murders of the family the film shifts gears to be more in line with an EXORCIST knock off than an actually Amityville movie, as we see a priest trying to eliminate the demon from Sonny's body during an exorcism taking place inside the house. The usual haunted house shenanigans are present here, but are more cleverly conceived & executed & the atmosphere is good & eerie, there's plenty of good scary moments & the whole execution is gloriously unhinged & very compelling. Several scenes stand out, the scary demon voice that talks to Sonny while he is listening to music on his Walkman, a priest dreaming that the entire Montelli family has been murdered, only to awaken & find out it's reality, a priest receives a phone call form the Montelli's oldest daughter, telling him that Sonny may be trying to kill them, which would be fine except for the fact she's been dead a few days! Based loosely on a script by DARDANDO SACHETTI (Who also penned DEMONS) called ENTITY, who's plot about the spirit of an Ogre taunting a family was later picked up & used as the basis for the in name only sequel OGRE DEMONS 3.

Daniel Stern and Fred Savage actually appear together here, instead of Stern merely being the adult version of Savage's character narrating his life. Stern seems more like a monster than a loving father in some scenes, but he shows a tender side too. And I have to single out Frank Whaley as the deliciously evil leader of the fantasy world.The makeup was outstanding. Some of the monsters were absolutely revolting. The visual effects were nicely done, and the dark fantasy world well designed.I would say this is a movie for the whole family, though a few scenes were a little too scary for the youngest children, especially toward the end.Overall, it was a fun adventure.

Sounds simple, but Don Logan is not the type of man you want to say no to, as he doesn't take no for an answer. Logan arrives, immediately disrupting Gary's idyllic life with his vulgar mouth and antisocial behaviour, then he tells him about the job. Gary declines, politely. Logan, true to form, insists that he do it. A battle of wills erupts as Gary tries to let Logan down without getting himself or his wife killed, but a brutal psychological showdown leaves Gary with no other option than to do the job&#133; Debut feature director Jonathan Glazer (he of the 'horses riding waves' Guinness advert) keeps the simple story tight and entertaining, combining surrealistic imagery with a sun-soaked Spanish location and concentrating on what makes Sexy Beast a real gem the performances. Winstone is as good as ever as the put-upon Gary Dove, but this is Kingsley's film, as he takes Logan and makes him his own, making us believe in what could easily have been a one-dimensional character and delivering a multi-layered performance. Witness Gandhi saying lines that would make a dog blush as he insults, threatens and manipulates Gary and his friends with a razor-sharp tongue that spits venom and electrifies the screen. The dialogue is fresh and biting, with some of the most witty and imaginative use of swearing ever committed to film. If you're offended by the dreaded 'C' word, Sexy Beast may not be for you, as it graces almost every line of dialogue throughout the film. In the wrong hands, the script could have been played very badly, but Kingsley's energy and conviction makes the sweary dialogue seem almost poetic. Example 'You f--kin' doctor-white honking, jam-rag f--kin' spunk bubble! You keep looking at me, Aitch, and I'll put you in the f--kin' ground!' Although this may not read like poetry, you have to listen to Kingsley's wording to appreciate it. But believe me, you'll be quoting Don Logan for weeks! For a director whose output consists mainly of elaborate music videos and commercials, Glazer wisely concentrates instead on acting and narrative to deliver a great film - if only more filmmakers would heed to the simple rule that story and performance make for good entertainment. The style is still there, though, as there are some great surreal visuals and Gary's nightmares of a hairy man-hare wielding a machine gun are incredibly effective. Sexy Beast packs a punch in all departments, never flagging or giving in to distracting sub-plots, but going all out to deliver a tight, thrilling, funny, horrific British Gangster Movie &#153; that entertains right up until the far-too-early ending.

I had several friends and acquaintances who raved about it and I was more than impressed to see Toad the Wet Sprocket and Gin Blossoms on the soundtrack. Talk about being disappointed. This is a dull film with little merit beyond the obvious appeal of its idle fantasy. We're young and we have problems but we stick together and straighten ourselves out with a party seems to be the single puerile point this movie drives for.The characters are almost without exception completely unlikable and poorly developed (although the bald girl is rather cool). One character blows all the record store's money at the beginning of the film, no reason given. Liv Tyler wants to sleep with her aging pop idol and elicits no sympathy. Zellweger actually does sleep with him and elicits even less. I wanted to slap them both. The artist with the coins in the floor is in love with Liv but I just wished he would see how impossibly stupid she was and date someone else.

This is a dull film with little merit beyond the obvious appeal of its idle fantasy. We're young and we have problems but we stick together and straighten ourselves out with a party seems to be the single puerile point this movie drives for.The characters are almost without exception completely unlikable and poorly developed (although the bald girl is rather cool). One character blows all the record store's money at the beginning of the film, no reason given. Liv Tyler wants to sleep with her aging pop idol and elicits no sympathy. Zellweger actually does sleep with him and elicits even less. I wanted to slap them both. The artist with the coins in the floor is in love with Liv but I just wished he would see how impossibly stupid she was and date someone else.

No one dies, no car crashes, explosions etc. NOT a Hollywood movie. Interesting characters, humor, fun and colorful scenes make it a joy to watch. Licia Maglietta is a housewife who is left behind on a vacation with her family and embarks on an adventure. And nothing really bad happens to her. God forbid! If you want a movie with gritty reality, this probably isn't what you are looking for. Licia Maglietta plays a kind of klutzy, out of sorts woman with a whimsical air that never devolves into slapstick, or the kind of behavior that would make you think she is stupid. She did, after all have a family, and took care of them well. But that, we can tell, isn't enough sometimes, and when it's not, things get broken. Or you can get lost.The film is sweet and fun, but not too sweet. And to see such a beautiful mature woman in a movie, instead of some cookie cutter young Hollywood flavor of the year, is a treat in itself. And so beautiful she is! I could watch expressions play across her face all day.

In all four of them, Pacino played the mean and ruthless mobster, who dominates the street Either as a skillful and much-feared capo di capi in the Godfather series, or as a talented, yet self-destructive, mobster who rises to the top (and then collapses) in Scarface.Carlito's Way would seem to be a replica of the above successful formula, at first sight Al Pacino is Carlito Brigante, a mobster who has just got out of jail with the help of his friend and lawyer, David Kleinfeld (Penn). However, this is where the similarities end. Whereas in all the above films Pacino is portrayed as a determined and unreformed criminal to the very end, Carlito is a very different type of guy In fact, as soon as he is out, he has taken the brave decision to change path. He wants to give up his criminal ways, and become an honest citizen. To this end, he runs a bar, trying to collect some money so as to set up a car-rental business. However, although he has the wholehearted support of his girlfriend Gail (Miller) to this project, it is difficult to escape his past. Even his friend and lawyer, Kleinfeld, proves to be an obstacle to his road towards salvation.Brian De Palma has directed a great film, in which he portrays brilliantly the character of a man who agonizes to make a clean start, but encounters everywhere forces which push him back to his dark roots. Al Pacino is (again) great, while both Penelope Ann Miller and Sean Penn are very good as the two competing and opposite influences for Carlito.Carlito's Way is less a crime film, and more a drama one, according to my opinion. The story is beautiful, and although the beginning of the film seems to give some hints, we do not know until the very end whether this man of good intentions managed to escape from his ghosts or not. Watch and find for yourselves! 8\/10.
