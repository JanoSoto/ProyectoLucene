The last film. If you remember, I'd compared the arc of the three Phantasm films to the arc of the first three Alien films from spooky, atmospheric thriller, to action adventure(The Electric Boogaloo Gambit), to psychological head-game. As bad as it is, Phantasm IV Oblivion, fits right in with this comparison.AlienResurrection tried to be this massive, epic view of the universe in which the Alien series was set you got to see the Company, the military, space pirates, and of course you got to see a whole boatload of aliens. All this was wrapped in a movie that looks like the entre to an invasion of earth by all those nasty aliens. Bang, here comes the well-known Final Apocalypse.Phantasm IV same dang thing. It tries(and completely fails) to become some kind of X-Files sized conspiracy, wherein the Tall Man is some kind of interdimensional, time jumping bandit who actually just used to be the friendly neighborhood doctor and Incredibly Gifted Scientist. Michael is back, wandering around the desert Don Juan of the Yaqui-style, plotting to destroy the Tall Man, or find him in the past, or something or other. It's never really clear, and the whole struggle he's having with whatever is inside him is never quite resolved. \\Meanwhile, Reggie is still on the road, still picking up girls who would never look at him and trying to do them, and playing with his four barrelled shotgun, among other things. The kid from the previous film is utterly discarded, and Rocky is by now training to become the arch villainess in the next Kickboxer film. Jody is still annoying.All of this is cached in what is supposed to revelatory never before seen footage that neither advances nor informs the story. Michael tries to hang himself, because apparently, he strung up the Tall Man at some point in the first film--and then cut the guy down. The scene is pitiful--it was cut for a reason, folks--and it just confused me. The rest of the revolutionary new footgage mainly consists of Michael running and jumping onto Reggie's Ice Cream Truck--at night, during the day, in the rain, etc., etc. It is worthless, and I'm tempted to think they structured the entirely structure-less film around this footage so people would look at it and think they were planning this sequel to fit it like a glove, years and years later. Blah.The ending is truly pathetic and leads nowhere. Tall Man is no longer interesting, because he is indestructible he's been pumped full of hydrochloric acid, dropped down a square hole, forzen in liquid nitrogen, and blown-up. Nothing's going to stop him. THAT'S NO FUN. Additionally, we never really truly understand what happened to Jedediah Morningside when he went into his magical device, nor do we get to understand what he wants to do with all those silver balls he's always carrying around. Reggie takes off after said Tall Man with said shotgun, and Mikey appears to be dying, all the while saying to himself, Gosh, this reminds me of the time I jumped on Reggie's Ice Cream Truck...CUE NEVER BEFORE SEEN FOOTAGEWe have hit bottom, to put it plainly. What started off as kind of cool has become a s**tstorm. Here are some bumps along the descent--What's up with Michael building a remote-control hearse to blow up the Tall Man? This is the most hyped-up prop in the history of all filmmaking, and it does absolutely nothing.Zing--little ball flies out, stabs Tall Man in head. Bamf--car explodes and burns up Tall Man. Eyyyerp--another Tall Man walks out from between the tuning-fork thing. What? Did Michael really think that was going to work? The exploding car thing, with it's forty minutes of set-up and three seconds of useless execution, was limper than Bob Dole during a Viagra shortage.--Jody, get your f***ing hands out of your pockets. Christ.--Did I mention I was glad when Jody gets it, even though I don't know why it happened? I figured it was just the divine providence of some better, dead filmmaker looking down on me.--Girl with killer silver balls for breasts. Ewww. Not even creative.--Who was the Demon Trooper? He pops up out of nowhere. Looks like a reject from Resident Evil, and is mostly there to give Reggie the chance to utter the stirring words Blow me.--Jody, put your hands where I can see them! Now!Well, there it is. Four up, four down. First one started off strong, but the rest just slowly descended into a massive pool-pah of garbage. But it was a valiant attempt, Mr. Coscarelli, and I applaud your initiative. You just got suckered into a mainstream archetype that you felt you had to follow. Too bad.I hear tell of a fifth movie, set in an apocalyptic future, where the Tall Man rules some kind of plague-ridden wasteland from Utah. I have to wonder if one of the lines from the movie(Jody, saying to Michael on one of their interdimensional jaunts to a vacant cityWe have to go. There's a chance of contamination.)was meant to be a lead-in.

The movie shows you how people are trying to get money and benefits, it shows you how sometimes it is very difficult for people to make decisions when they are in a very tough situation, it shows you how some organizations trying to cover themselves up when they do something really bad, and most importantly, it sends the audience a very important message - do what has meanings for you, do what is right for you.Go watch it if you haven't, i definitely recommend it for everybody.

He worms his way into the lives of a rich shipyard owning family, who pay him to travel to Italy to convince their son, Dickie, to return to America. Once there he befriends Dickie, and becomes obsessed with assuming his identity an obsession with deadly consequences.In similar style to The Beach, Ripley is a very loosely based adaptation, but unlike Boyle's latest, the film doesn't suffer from straying from the original text. In fact, after reading a series of mixed reviews, I was surprised to find this the most enjoyable film of the year so far.Ripley possesses all the typical qualities of a Minghella film, notably some wonderful art direction that captures all the charm of 50's Italy, and some impressive cast performances, which are no doubt aided by a sharp and intelligent script.Much of the talk has been of Jude Law, and although his turn as the sexually charismatic playboy Dickie is Oscar worthy, it's a performance that didn't deserve top over-shadow Damon, who hasn't recieved the credit due for his excellent portrayal of the calculated but very confused protagonist. The supporting cast also offer some competent performances, with only Paltrow prone to a touch of the 'over the top acting syndrome.Ripley's true strength is that it can be enjoyed on many levels. Fundamentally, Ripley is a thriller, but it is also an interesting study of compulsive lying, the deceitful nature of charm, and the turmoil of having no identity. Minghella has avoided the temptation to make this an edge of the seat thriller, sacrificing a degree of suspense for psychological study ,but nevertheless the film manages to maintain a creepy atmosphere throughout and has so much more depth as a result.Ripley, is not a film that will cause nightmares, nor is it a film that answers any questions, or offers any solutions. Instead it's an intelligent, intriguing and very dark insight into the life of a complex character who is at war with himself. Thought provoking and entertaining, and even if a touch over long, well worth seeing.

The main characters are 'usual' people but after taking a deep look along the movie you find out that they are not usual at all!

Get it at Amazon.)What we have here is a tantra shrink, a psychoanalytic shrink and a women's support group counseling shrink, and together they cure (that's the implication anyway) a woman made frigid, compulsive, obsessive and I forget what else by her father's sexual abuse. This bit of glorification of therapy suffers from the sort of defect usually found in an action\/adventure\/thriller movie, namely that of illogic. It seems that what really caused all this harm was the penis, the father's mean staff. This is the lie. (A trendy lie, by the way.) However what is really being presented here unbeknown to the authors in an unconscious acting out is the glorification of the penis. This is consistent with shrink psychology since those guys still haven't freed themselves from the Freudian obsession with it, and it is consistent with the American patriarchy since the one thing so sacred in our society that it cannot be shown publicly (except in double X-rated flicks) is the erect penis. And it's the patriarchy that has exclusive possession of that. (Sorry girls!) Any dyke can tell you that this kind of psychology is a phony tantalization leading to the perpetuation of penis envy.The problem with any attempt at sexual honesty in a public sense is it's really impossible because we are within the sexual system ourselves and subject to its taboos, no matter how we might try to break away. This restraint on true expression is most felt by the most highly socialized members of society. Highly educated and over socialized shrinks typically tend to be blinded more than others (hence society's penchant to make fun of them). And even if they could see the truth, they couldn't express it since they would be out of business. It is only the crazies and the great artists who can break free of the taboo system and see what's real and express it. What we have here is unfortunately not the work of a crazy or a great artist, but of highly sensitive, highly socialized members of the human society trying to make a living. Trapped and struggling to break free, but of course giving in to the propaganda and the straitjacket of the species mechanism. If you are a member of the society, you cannot tell the full truth about the society. You have to break free first. You have to move outside that society. And if you do, you probably won't care enough to express yourself.We can see that the authors of this movie tried to break free and thought they really were on the right track, ah but, they smelled commercial success and in the end conformed to society's prejudices, society's taboos and fed us back the usual sexual BS. If somehow a sexual counselor were to really understand human sexuality and (more important) be able to transmit that understanding to others, he or she would immediately be condemned since the system itself, by its very nature, demands duplicity and hypocrisy. That is the most important single thing we can learn about human sexuality the veil of illusion. Sexuality must be private and not public and as such any public pronouncement must be a lie. It's a hard truth to realize, but something known in the heart of every prude and Republican congressman (although not in their minds). When those with starry-eyed visions of telling it like it really is come close to the holy grail of sexual truth they falter. One might call it the magnetic repulsive nature of sexual knowledge.Having said all this I applaud the attempt. Incidentally the sex scenes are very sexy and the three stars, Craig Sheffer, Sheryl Lee and especially Terence Stamp do an excellent job.

Be it true love or merely puppy love, it is ever-present throughout the film, Some Girls. Starring both Patrick Dempsey, as Michael, and Jennifer Connelly, as Gaby, this movie contains something for everyone, depending on how insightful the viewer chooses to be. It can be taken as simply a hilarious comedy or a genuinely profound portrayal of love and human nature; the viewer is given this choice.As a comedy, Some Girls plays on Dempsey's vulnerabilities, or in other words, the fact that he is a teenage male that has yet to figure out women. Michael, continually rejected by his quondam love, Gaby, is repeatedly taken advantage of by Connelly's on-screen sisters, Irenka and Simone, and he inadvertently falls in love with Granny. Dempsey's naivety gets him into a countless number of awkward situations with the women of the D'Arc family, such as winding up in bed with them and getting caught in the nude, which adds to the humor of the movie.The love that Michael and Granny feel for each other is a transition between the comical and the symbolic sides of this film. In the wonderfully set-up scene where Michael undresses Granny, the viewers start to feel uncomfortable when they realize that Granny isn't going to be innocently nude. She enjoys the attention, and because this type of sexual encounter is not socially accepted, it causes unease. Due to the discomfort that this scene causes in the viewer, it becomes humorous that this teenage boy is undressing this old woman who is quickly falling for him. However, it is not humor alone that is at work here. This scene sets up the rest of the movie and allows for true love to blossom.Although Michael went to Quebec to see his love, Gaby, he fell in love with the last person that he expected, or even desired to fall in love with Granny. The two of them became unbelievably close during the film and developed a love deeper than the one that he had only imagined forming between him and Gaby. There love was true love, despite the fact that Dempsey tried to push it aside at the very beginning. However, Michael let up his guard, letting himself fall madly and deeply in love with Granny, the woman he could never have due to both society and mortality.For the movie aficionado who loves symbolism, Some Girls is a wonderful choice of movies. It is a film that can be watched over and over again and something new will occur to the viewer each and every time that it is watched. The viewer may discover what Botticelli's Three Graces, who appear several times during the film, have to do with the three D'Arc sisters or maybe why Beowulf jumped out of the window with the clock in his mouth. He or she may realize why the unicorn tapestry covers Gaby's bedroom door or why the girls' father feels that he must write in the nude. The viewer may realize that the film both begins and ends with water and why that fact is so important. In order to appreciate these things, however, the movie must be watched and it must be watched more than once.Some Girls is truly a structural masterpiece. It appears as if in every scene, there is some hidden symbol, or underlying idea, that makes the film multifaceted instead of just straightforward and simple to understand. The details make the film an extraordinary one instead of just an ordinary one. The flashback scene exemplifies the structural merit better than any other scene. It is perfectly choreographed, with the time being split between the car scene and the window-closing scene well enough to keep the viewer on the edge of his or her seat. The flashback went from the peacefulness of the window closing to the frenzied ride to the hospital without falter. Another wonderful scene that demonstrates the film's magnificent structure is the scene in which Michael and Granny are alone in the old abandoned house. Nothing whatsoever prepares the viewer for what is about to come, and it is better left that way. It merely shows love in its purest form.In the same way that Michael receives something that he didn't expect from going to Quebec, the viewer receives something that he or she probably doesn't expect from the movie. Michael learns what love is all about and the viewer learns what great films are made of. By the end of the movie, Michael has changed for the better. He has matured, learned a little about women, fallen in love, and maybe even gained some religion from his experiences. He left the three women of the D'Arc family, and moved on to the woman of the Lumiere family. By doing this, he moved from the darkness to the light, as their surnames symbolically imply. Hopefully, the viewer can do the same if they take the time to watch this exquisite film.

Be it true love or merely puppy love, it is ever-present throughout the film, Some Girls. Starring both Patrick Dempsey, as Michael, and Jennifer Connelly, as Gaby, this movie contains something for everyone, depending on how insightful the viewer chooses to be. It can be taken as simply a hilarious comedy or a genuinely profound portrayal of love and human nature; the viewer is given this choice.As a comedy, Some Girls plays on Dempsey's vulnerabilities, or in other words, the fact that he is a teenage male that has yet to figure out women. Michael, continually rejected by his quondam love, Gaby, is repeatedly taken advantage of by Connelly's on-screen sisters, Irenka and Simone, and he inadvertently falls in love with Granny. Dempsey's naivety gets him into a countless number of awkward situations with the women of the D'Arc family, such as winding up in bed with them and getting caught in the nude, which adds to the humor of the movie.The love that Michael and Granny feel for each other is a transition between the comical and the symbolic sides of this film. In the wonderfully set-up scene where Michael undresses Granny, the viewers start to feel uncomfortable when they realize that Granny isn't going to be innocently nude. She enjoys the attention, and because this type of sexual encounter is not socially accepted, it causes unease. Due to the discomfort that this scene causes in the viewer, it becomes humorous that this teenage boy is undressing this old woman who is quickly falling for him. However, it is not humor alone that is at work here.

The surprise 'twist' at the end was great, but the movie itself is the thing that made it even look better. Neat editing, awesome camera shots, excellent script, solid acting, superb directing.....

But after meeting Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt), getting in a few fights changed his life. The 30~45 minutes of fist fighting would be one of the most raw 30~45 minutes in film history. Those fight clubs grow larger and it becomes out of control. Can society change a man into an anti-social behaving guy? Absolutely. Maybe you hated this film because of its attitude or its graphic violence. But I think you misunderstood this stylish film.Was this violence and bad-assed attitude totally necessary? Yes. Without the violence, it would be like Eyes Wide Shut without graphic sexuality. This film isn't only about violence. It's about how the meaningles life in society can change people. It just used violence to show it. Okay some of it is about violence, but it was just something the director used to desribe the society.Oh and one other thing.

Part war movie, part comedy, part bank-job caper, the different elements combine seamlessly to produce a distinctive and memorable film.Clint Eastwood, in an unusually subdued but nonetheless commanding performance, plays the leader of a platoon of restless GIs in the chaos of post D-Day France.  When he captures a German officer who just happens to be in possession of a solid gold bar, Clint extracts the necessary information and before you can say Three Kings, he's hatched a plan to make it 30 miles beyond enemy lines to nab the $16 million stash.  He can't do it alone, of course, but has no trouble in convincing his fellow troops that if they're going to be killed in this war, the reward for them should be worth the risk.  Enlisting the help of Quartermaster Crapgame (Don Rickles) Sergeant Big Joe (Telly Savalas) and Sherman tank driver Oddball (Donald Sutherland) among others, Kelly and his platoon of ironic heroes are soon on their way to an eventual showdown with the German Tiger tank unit guarding the bank...All too often cross-genre pictures can be let down if the balance isn't right, but that's not the case here because each element is as good as it can be.  The action and battle scenes are well executed, especially that in which Oddball and his Shermans attack a German depot.  The comic relief is genuinely funny rather than cheesy, and includes a beautiful scene at the climax of the movie which gently parodies Clint's spaghetti-western days, complete with the strains of cod-Morricone music.  The suspense is well maintained where necessary, such as the scene where the platoon is caught exposed in the middle of a minefield with a truckload of Germans bearing down on them.  And of course there is the ensemble cast, which is uniformly excellent.  Keep an eye out for a young Harry Dean Stanton, and Len Lesser, who is better known as Uncle Leo in Seinfeld.  Sutherland's proto-hippie (Always with them negative waves, Moriarty!) and Carroll O'Connor's manic General  Colt are just two performances which live long in the memory, alongside the ever-reliable Eastwood and Savalas.There are a few points made about the madness and futility of war if that's what you're looking for.  Allied bombers knock out bridges by day, German mobile engineers rebuild them by night... neither the Americans or the Germans seem to know what's going on or where their lines are supposed to be... behind the lines our heroes are attacked by their own aircraft... General Colt  mistakes Kelly's gold-inspired push for a patriotic determination to end the war, and mobilizes his army to follow him, chastising the staff officers around him for failing to show the same spirit!But ultimately, this movie is about entertainment rather than political comment.  And as such it is one of the most successful examples of its type, as the almost total absence of negative comments from this page should indicate.  The script by Troy Kennedy Martin (The Italian Job) is tight, and direction by Brian G Hutton (Where Eagles Dare) equally assured. Perhaps regarded as lightweight in comparison to other, more serious men on a mission movies such as Robert Aldrich's The Dirty Dozen or Hutton's aforementioned Where Eagles Dare, the film has nonetheless been influential.  For example, although David O Russell's Three Kings veers off on a tangent and makes more of a serious comment on the US role in the Gulf War, its matchbook plot (ie that which can be written on the back of a matchbook) is the same as Kelly's Heroes.  And in the speakers mounted on the side of Oddball's tanks, used to blast music at the enemy and freak them out, there is more than a hint of the Wagner-playing helicopters in Coppola's Apocalypse Now, still some nine years hence at the time of this film's release.In my humble opinion, therefore, Kelly's Heroes is a supremely enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.  You will be doing yourself a favour if, next time you get the chance, you take a look.  It's rare that I see a film and don't think at least once that I'd change something about it, but if there is something to change in Kelly's Heroes, I don't know what it is.

Enlisting the help of Quartermaster Crapgame (Don Rickles) Sergeant Big Joe (Telly Savalas) and Sherman tank driver Oddball (Donald Sutherland) among others, Kelly and his platoon of ironic heroes are soon on their way to an eventual showdown with the German Tiger tank unit guarding the bank...All too often cross-genre pictures can be let down if the balance isn't right, but that's not the case here because each element is as good as it can be.  The action and battle scenes are well executed, especially that in which Oddball and his Shermans attack a German depot.  The comic relief is genuinely funny rather than cheesy, and includes a beautiful scene at the climax of the movie which gently parodies Clint's spaghetti-western days, complete with the strains of cod-Morricone music.  The suspense is well maintained where necessary, such as the scene where the platoon is caught exposed in the middle of a minefield with a truckload of Germans bearing down on them.  And of course there is the ensemble cast, which is uniformly excellent.  Keep an eye out for a young Harry Dean Stanton, and Len Lesser, who is better known as Uncle Leo in Seinfeld.  Sutherland's proto-hippie (Always with them negative waves, Moriarty!) and Carroll O'Connor's manic General  Colt are just two performances which live long in the memory, alongside the ever-reliable Eastwood and Savalas.There are a few points made about the madness and futility of war if that's what you're looking for.  Allied bombers knock out bridges by day, German mobile engineers rebuild them by night... neither the Americans or the Germans seem to know what's going on or where their lines are supposed to be... behind the lines our heroes are attacked by their own aircraft... General Colt  mistakes Kelly's gold-inspired push for a patriotic determination to end the war, and mobilizes his army to follow him, chastising the staff officers around him for failing to show the same spirit!But ultimately, this movie is about entertainment rather than political comment.  And as such it is one of the most successful examples of its type, as the almost total absence of negative comments from this page should indicate.  The script by Troy Kennedy Martin (The Italian Job) is tight, and direction by Brian G Hutton (Where Eagles Dare) equally assured. Perhaps regarded as lightweight in comparison to other, more serious men on a mission movies such as Robert Aldrich's The Dirty Dozen or Hutton's aforementioned Where Eagles Dare, the film has nonetheless been influential.  For example, although David O Russell's Three Kings veers off on a tangent and makes more of a serious comment on the US role in the Gulf War, its matchbook plot (ie that which can be written on the back of a matchbook) is the same as Kelly's Heroes.  And in the speakers mounted on the side of Oddball's tanks, used to blast music at the enemy and freak them out, there is more than a hint of the Wagner-playing helicopters in Coppola's Apocalypse Now, still some nine years hence at the time of this film's release.In my humble opinion, therefore, Kelly's Heroes is a supremely enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.  You will be doing yourself a favour if, next time you get the chance, you take a look.  It's rare that I see a film and don't think at least once that I'd change something about it, but if there is something to change in Kelly's Heroes, I don't know what it is.

Part war movie, part comedy, part bank-job caper, the different elements combine seamlessly to produce a distinctive and memorable film.Clint Eastwood, in an unusually subdued but nonetheless commanding performance, plays the leader of a platoon of restless GIs in the chaos of post D-Day France.
