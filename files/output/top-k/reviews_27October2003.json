[{"date":"27 October 2003","score":"","review":"  Mystery Men is a strange amalgam of elements that left me wondering what type of movie I had just sat through.  On the one hand, it tries to be a slapstick comedy, on the other a satire of hero-villain stereotypes, yet it never really succeeds in doing anything.  The comedy present is mostly in the form of humorous one-liners, while many scenes appear serious in an attempt at irony that is quite confusing.  I can only take the action to be a try at humorous parody of the typical super-hero fare, yet it succeeded mainly in being awkward.  The plot was perfectly abysmal, the score uninteresting, and thus the film was overall fairly un-engaging.  The acting was good, especially considering the bizarre characters and lines in the film, but it wasn't quite enough to overcome the uneasiness created by so many other parts of the movie.  Also, some very bad acting (especially between Ben Stiller and the waitress) detracted from the strange but somewhat laudable performances throughout the remainder.  The cinematography was decent, and to its credit the movie was effective in creating a very unique ambience; unfortunately, the interesting environment was used for the most part to alienate the viewer, leaving one trying to figure out what's important in the film.  I must make the disclaimer that I am almost entirely unfamiliar with most superhero movies (or comic books, etc), so perhaps the failure in comprehension was my fault and not the movie's.  Overall, original idea, good setting, reasonable acting, and I laughed a few times; on the other hand, none of that saves it from the overwhelming sense of unjustifiable weirdness (and normally I like weird movies).  5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 October 2003","score":"","review":"  Mystery Men is a strange amalgam of elements that left me wondering what type of movie I had just sat through.

To this day it remains to me the most bizarre, intense, scary and at times hilarious mystery of a movie i have ever seen. That really sums it up for me as the movie the whole way through terrified yet at the same time compelled me. Every twisted image made me cower in fright and yet at the same time compel to exclaim, damn that looks cool! What really makes the movie amazing is David Lynch's extraordinary ability to recreate the same sense of confused fear we would have in a dream. The movie genuinely doesn't have a beginning or an end. The whole movie seems completely other-wordly but seems to make sense. The world portrayed here is absolutely insane but inside, to it's inhabitants, seems normal. This means the audience can appreciate both the artistry of this world created and our complete inability to grasp and understand it, which in my opinion sounds a bit like heaven.

'Mystery Science Theater 3000 The Movie' tries to fulfill fan expectations without alienating newcomers, and it doesn't quite succeed.I know that many have complained about the choice of the sci-fi classic 'This Island Earth' as a target here, but that objection doesn't make much sense--really, folks, there are very few films that are simply too good to be poked fun of, and 'This Island Earth' certainly isn't one of them, even if it doesn't live down to MST3K's usual standard.No, the problem is largely one of rhythm. The charm of the TV show has always been its overloaded quality, with the snarky armchair wits keeping the jabs and pop-culture references flying so fast that the bomb-to-laugh ratio always stays relatively low. Not so with the bigscreen version, where the stream of jokes was apparently slowed down to accommodate audience laughter in the cinema. On video, you can really feel that, and it hurts the pace terribly. The 'linking' material feels redundant to the initiated, and isn't likely to impress the novice viewer much.Still, many of the jokes that are there do work, and the overall effect is one of rather weak episode of the TV show. Of course, that's going to appeal more to some people than others, so fanboys and newbies alike should consider themselves warned. 6.5 out of 10.
