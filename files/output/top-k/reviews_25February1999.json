I loved this movie.I understand why many people did not like it, but I think they should have another look. Sure, it is not an easy movie to watch, and Meryl Streep's character is not the most pleasant woman in the world, but that is part of the point. Plenty is unabashedly unsentimental, and that is one of its greatest strengths.Meryl Streep gives one of her best performances, and it's not only because of her flawless British accent. That is just the surface of Ms. Streep's complete, and absolutely brilliant transformation into a very complicated character. She is also sexier than she has ever been on screen up to that time.This film is about as performance-oriented as films get, and it is full of great performances -the entire cast is excellent!!Plenty is a movie about how different life can turn out from the way we plan it. It is not supposed to be cheerful. It is gritty, gripping, and extremely powerful. It portrays the hardships of Resistance era France, and the harsh realities of Britain immediately after the Second World War; as well as the decadence that prosperity can bring, and the disappointments of life, and how the inability to deal with them can destroy a person´s sanity.Of particular note are Charles Dance, as Streep´s husband, Sam Neil as her lover, Sting and Tracey Ullman in small but important supporting roles, and especially Sir John Gielgud, who effortlessly steals the few scenes he is in. In one of the movie's few comic moments, Mr. Gielgud corrects the wife of a Burmese diplomat just as he is leaving a dinner party on the nationality of a certain European film director. Just this scene makes the movie worth watching!I have seen this movie described as an underrated tour-de-force. That is an extremely fitting description. I would add the word classic to that description.  This is a film that challenges the viewer to sit through its grim depictions of what life can be like if we don´t know how to deal with life not turning out like we want it to.  Depicting different eras from the Second World War to the early to mid sixties, Plenty is a period piece with painstaking recreations and some incredible locations in England, France and Jordan.If someone has not seen this movie, I urge them to buy it or rent it and watch it. There is no widescreen version available, which is unfortunate, because of the stunning cinematography, among other things. To anyone who appreciates great acting, this film is a MUST SEE. No serious film collector should be without this great classic.If someone has seen it but did not like it, I urge them to watch it again, and again.I have seen this film at least ten times, and I could easily watch it ten times more.

He finds her intelligence and classy attitude sexy, not her body which is like a regular good-looking persons, not some dam super-models. I felt I had to write in again and say people who found this movie boring are really shallow and have seen the same Hollywood crap over and over again so many times that they can't know when they see a good film or not. And this movie actully makes jokes without having to have every joke have to do with a bodly function or making fun of retards. The ending was amazing, you may disagree with how I used the word amazing because of its simpleness. But that's what is so amazing about it, it is simple and happy. It leaves you with a smile on your face for a long time after.

I saw the movie Alien for the first time ever in 1997.  Slowly the viewer approaches a ship that looks almost like a city. We are taken inside.  Breezes and small sounds fill the inside of the ship. We are taken on a silent tour, and then watch as the computer wakes the few passengers up and the movie begins. After watching the movement and feeling that Ridley Scott (the director) put forth for all us movie goers my curiosity was stirred.  Honestly, as a woman myself who lives a complicated human life I could relate to Ellen Ripley.  Whether it was her struggle to keep alive even while all those around her are destroyed, or just a struggle to stay in her status position or responsible position.   All of us feel all that way at some time.  So, after Alien, I saw Aliens.  The sequel was well written and believable. That is something one doesn't see very often at the theater.  Ellen wakes up after 57 years and seems just as human as before.  The journey in that sequel is filled with suspense, drama and even laughter.  The ending is once again filled with sorrow yet hope remains.  For most, Aliens is their favorite movie of all 4.  The child and the new and complex characters sparked many other viewers interests.  Alien 3 was of course the movie I saw next.  I believe the 3rd sequel and last journey for Ellen is misunderstood. Many great fans of the saga do not like Alien 3.  Many say it must have been Ripley's dream and could have never really happened in her life story. I loved it.  I appreciate the introduction we all get into reality.  Because in real life, (just as Number 8 (the cloned Ripley) says in this new film Alien Resurrection), we die. IWhen Alien Ressurection first came to the theaters I was amoung the very first to get in line to see it.  Suddenly the lights go out.  A very  recognisable type of music begins. Skin is pushed around the screen, something is being made.  Space surrounds you.  Things are strangely quiet once again.  Another ship is in the distance.  We enter the ship, the Usm Auriga space craft and walk through the door to see the same men we remember from Alien 3. Men in white lab coats.  Inside a embryonic tube we see a child.  Quietly she says to herself,  My mommy always said there were no monsters.. no real ones.. but there are.  Any fan knows this child is quoting another child named Newt.  Yet this time the words take on new meaning.  This journey of Ripley no.8 is a new one.  I think it is a very important addition to the saga.In conclution, after seeing all of these 4 segments of Ellen Ripleys' story in a row,  I think that the meaning behind it all is more than feminism or heroism.  I really believe it is all about being human.  I have really found a treasure in these 4 films and I hope that the future generations to come find her story just as interesting.

The themes (life\/death, age and usefulness, friendship and sacrifice, destiny, revenge) in the film are so richly developed and the character development so strong (somehow showing new sides of characters that had already been well-developed over the course of 15 or so years).  And Star Trek 2 is one of the only films I have ever seen that uses other works (Tale of Two Cities and Moby Dick) to the benefit of the film and not as a crutch.  And the symbolism!!!  Don't get me wrong--I'm not saying that the metaphors were very complex but they certainly were rich.  Genesis being the ultimate force of both creation and destruction at the same time.  The journey of details like the glasses, which are silly but add reality to the story.  Acting from William Shatner that truly is subtle!  And a true weight of friendship expressed.  I don't believe that I have ever seen friendship that was as believable as that shown between Spock and Jim, Bones and Jim.  A sacrifice felt.  I love that. I love that Spock's sacrifice is felt as a sacrifice--actually FELT as a sacrifice and not just reported.  And yet he makes this sacrifice willingly. I think about this often, placing myself in spock's shoes.  If I were with a group of 300 people and one of us could die to save the rest and no one were to volunteer, could I do it?  Knowing that I would die anyways but that my death would save the rest--the logical decision is to volunteer--I'm dead either way, but I could never do it.  Could you? And the ingenuity!  This was a cat and mouse game that all viewers get behind because the stakes are real always and the deft manipulations in the chase seem plausible yet brilliant.  For example, the access codes.  I buy the idea of an access code.  The access codes are not a classic star Trek introduction of some new experimental and untested technology to save the day.  And the nebula--I buy that, too.  But these tricks just serve to even out sany advantage, constantly bringing the playing field back to level, so that, in the end, it's one crew against the other, trying to out-think each other and only the most cunning will be the victor. And lastly, this film set the thematic arc for the rest of the series.  Can one outlive his usefulness?  How do adventurers go to be grandparents?  What does one do when a life's purpose fades into the recesses?A beautiful film.  That can be experienced infinitely and always gain flavor. Thank you.

The ending was a little disappointing but somehow it didn't surprise me. Kevin Costner in a polo shirt, well what else needs to be said?  I enjoy his work as much as just looking at him!  I enjoyed this movie and would recommend others see it as well.

One, I've only seen it twice, and two, I can never be absolutely sure that I've actually seen it once it's over. It's more like a series of feverish, metallic images injected directly into your brain with a large bore needle. And I don't mean that in a bad way. Not at all. The first time I watched it, it completely floored me, even though I wasn't able to discern the faintest whiff of a plot. However, after spending some time on the internet, reading plot summaries provided by wirehead horror fanatics and anime buffs, it became crystal clear the second time. To try to summarize it here would only make me sound like a lunatic and it would give no real idea of what goes on in the course of this movie. The rapid-fire editing, the moody black and white cinematography, the spectacular gross-out effects... sure they've all been done before, but rarely have they been so effectively compressed into such an out of control mass of film. These images are completely unlike anything that would ever get a release in America. If you want the ultimate change of pace, Tetsuo is your man. One more problem I should mention I usually think I have a high pretension threshold, but even I had to chuckle at some scenes. If it were more grounded and had a more immediately discernible plot, it'd be right up there with Pi on my list of paranoid brain twisters. But then again, if it were these things, it would not be Tetsuo. See it for what it is, a pure adrenaline rush of film that today's blockbuster roller coaster rides can't hope to achieve.

The storyline has potential to be a wonderful psychological thriller, but falls short in the presentation.  While I happen to like Cage in most films, he does not fulfill the role well.  The biggest problem that I can see with this film is that there is no connection to the characters.  Unlike Usual Suspects or Apt Pupil where the connection to the characters draws you into the film and makes you relate to them (even in some demented way), this film leaves you caring nothing for anyone involved. There is no real development of the villain characters in this film, in fact you do not even meet them till the last 20 minutes or so.  Visually the movie is well shot, but the editing is lacking some dynamics that would have improved the feel. My general impression is that the creators are trying to shock people more then develop the plot, and unless you are easily shocked, it will not work. Overall, don't waste the 7 bux to see this in the theaters, rent it if you want to see it.
