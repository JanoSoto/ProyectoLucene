Sweeney, Julianna Margulies, Ossie Davis, Joan Plowright, Alfre Woodard Family film that operates like a computer generated Land Before Time. It regards time gone by and introduces Aladar who was raised by monkey-like creatures after his egg went through a difficult moving process. After a fireball destroys the island Aladar and his primate friends depart and seek life elsewhere. They join a herd that ventures for a nesting ground but first must cross a desert. Yar leads the herd with the attitude that only the strong will prevail. Aladar resists this rule and assists a brontosaurus named Mera and a triceratops named Emar who are old and weak. Clichés abound with violence inappropriate for the intended age group. Overwhelming with convincing full scale dinosaurs reduced to stereotypes voiced by D.B. Sweeney, Julianna Margulies, Ossie Davis, and Joan Plowright. Alfre Woodard voices Plio who cares about her family and is basically as dull as every other character in this film. Directed by Eric Leighton and Ralph Zondag who makes a great effort to bring these creatures to life but the screenplay is quite simply boring at best. The digital images are lively creating the reality of such creature but unfortunate the screenplay never becomes as overwhelming and awesome as the creatures that inspired it.
