The trailer looked awesome, and I can't believe I never touched the series, so I started off with the first (of course!) and got ready to plunge my mind into the world of impossible. The first one... in my opinion, was good. Nothing more to it. What brought me by surprise is it's intelligence and some sort of visible style. The film is highly complex, and builds up on pure intensity and some weird filming technique. Another surprising quality was it's slow movement. The action is there, but is shots are varied and surely spread apart. In fact, there are about 4 action scenes throughout the film (which I didn't expect) but it isn't a problem. The movie begins seriously interesting, and the complexity and filming gives it some weird feeling throughout. I would never call the film bad (as much do) but those people only expected action and nothing more. I expected action, but nothing near to the amount of build-up it presented. So the tag line sells it, you expect the impossible. The film doesn't rely on action sets and whatever comes after, it brings intellectual sense onto and presents it nicely. If the series continues to give this impression, Ghost Protocol should seriously deliver. If people could understand this film is not purely based on ACTION, this would probably get a more deserving score. Mission Impossible is the best way to make a spy film; intelligent plot, complexion, and intense sprawled action scenes throughout. See this film with caution, and expect the impossible. Impossibility that shows you can make a movie good without the such. Mission Impossible receives 7\/10.

Guess what? He's back and still has every quality he had in the original. I know, it sounds like there's a catch here. Well there is not-at least with Jim Carrey's character. I did not like this movie as much as the original for one reason and one reason only. No it wasn't that Courtney Cox didn't reprise her role as Melissa Robinson. That I can deal with. My problem was that the story involved some characters that made Ace Ventura's character seem stupid. What made the original funny was that Ace Ventura was on top of his game. He knew what he was doing and how he was doing it. What also made it funny was that nobody ELSE knew what he was doing and although it seemed strange, Ventura got the job done. This occurred throughout the entire first film. And that's how it goes for most of this movie. The part of the movie that I think either did not need to be added or could have been modified was when Ace Ventura was among the African Tribes. What was so hard for me grasp was that in the first movie, they took a smart crazy detective and put him around a bunch of normal people that understood nothing of what he did. When Ventura is around the Tribe members, he is the dumb crazy detective. Why do I say this? Because Jim Carrey's character does not speak their language. It is this major flaw of why some of the laughs fail in this movie for me. For example, when Ventura starts to eat the food at the tribe's festival, he does not realize what he was eating until he is told what it really was. I thought Ventura was the smart one here? The whole point of the first film was so that the joke would be on everyone else; now the roles are switched? Why? Does the laugh really need to be on our comedic hero? It was at that point I started to wonder whether Ace really knew what he was doing.Of course these kinds of instances did not happen all the time. There were many parts where Ventura was surrounded by upper class people who thought they were better than he was and just like the first film he proved them wrong with a snotty remark and an obscene gesture. That's the old Ace I know! That is what made Ace Ventura such a character. Ace Ventura When Nature Calls is almost a perfect sequel. It still has good laughs but it is dumbed down by its mediocre screenplay. It is because of this that Ace Ventura does not seem always on top of everyone else like he was in the first film.

The Extra-Terrestrial tells the story of a boy named Elliot, alienated by the people around him, until he meets a lonely, and forgotten alien, tracked down by government agents. Naming the alien E.T., Elliot and his brother and sister secretly raise this alien, and they learn that E.T. is creating a way to get back home to the Green Planet. The story then leads into an unlikely friendship between Elliot and E.T., that really makes the movie for what it is. Now, as you probably know, I'm a huge science fiction freak, and I extremely enjoy this movie. It's a loving tale of friendship and hope. Steven Spielberg once again does another brilliant directing job, and brings another instant classic. The special effects are like no other, since the E.T. alien is now an iconic figure. The performances by the young cast is surely the main subject of the movie. The sound effects are visual, the special effects are unique, and E.T. is a character that has such an imaginative taste and detail, and it's so wonderful to watch him on screen.

And this is one of my favorite things about this movie. The costuming, set dressing and locations all come together to create a believable high-end '80s world. There's genuine atmosphere here, especially with the steamy nighttime streets. It's remarkable because the movie was filmed in Toronto. They did an incredible job with the look of this movie.The other genius move is the casting of Christin Bale as Patrick Bateman. Hes become an accomplished actor in the last 15 years, without a doubt, but this is still my favorite performance. Bateman's such an empty shell, a societal poser spewing PR blurbs, and Bale infuses him with a manic energy, balancing it with the ever-slipping sanity.

The German offensive has pushed deep into Russia with only the city of Stalingrad left standing in resistance. As Enemy at the Gates begins we are thrown into the chaotic battlefield at Stalingrad on the Volga where the fate of the world is being decided. German air bombings have pummeled Stalingrad to an unrecognizable heap of ruins but the Russians refuse to surrender, their commanding officers are driven by a manic devotion (shooting their own men for deserting) to protecting the motherland and the cause of communism. With morale and hope nearing complete extinction; the Russian army is in desperate need of a catalyst to resurrect nationalistic fervor and pride. Enter Vasilli Zaitsev, (Jude Law) a common foot soldier from rural Russia, who arrives at Stalingrad and unleashes merciless, pin-point precision with the sniper rifle. Witnessing Zaitsev eliminate five German officers in rapid procession, military journalist Danilov has found the hero that will provide hope to a despondent, beleaguered nation. Danilov, proclaims, Here, the men's only choice is between German bullets and ours. But there's another way. The way of courage. The way of love of the Motherland. We must publish the army newspaper again. We must tell magnificent stories, stories that extol sacrifice, bravery. We must make them believe in the victory. We must give them hope, pride, a desire to fight. Yes... we need to make examples. But examples to follow, like Vasilli Zaitsev. Over-night Zaitsev is transformed into a national hero, his face on every newspaper, with every kill his legend grows. Despite his success, Zaitsev is uncomfortable in the spotlight and begs that Danilov tones down the hyperbolic articles he writes. In response to Zaitsev's rising success, the Germans call in their most prolific sniper, Major Konig (Ed Harris) to eliminate Zaitsev. An elaborate, tactful game of cat and mouse ensues between the two snipers which is highly suspenseful and entertaining. I'm not going to divulge the outcome, I will leave it up to you to discover on your own, but in my opinion the movie is definitely worth watching! Communist ideology, namely equality lies subversively and furtively at the core of Enemy at that Gates. Zaitsev epitomizes the strive for equality throughout the film, at one point he tells Daniliov, I'm not the only one fighting , to which Danilov replies, You're right the worker in the coal mine is just as important to the cause as you. Communism strives for complete equality throughout society no individual is greater than the other; everyone must serve the greater good of society. As the communist adage goes, Each according to his abilities, each according to his needs, everyone plays a major role in achieving equality. By eliminating private property, and personal wealth, communism purports that it's possible to create a utopia on Earth. Most would agree that pursuit of communism seems relatively pure and worthy, but under closer scrutiny, a major fault is revealed that inhibits perfect equality. There is a fundamental flaw in the human condition that is the antithesis of equality, that defect can be summarized as sin. No matter how earnest man strives, man is tied down by an anchor of sin which drags and halts the pursuit of equality. At the zenith of the film, Danilov has an epiphany and realizes the futility of communist ideology, I've been such a fool, Vassili. Man will always be a man. There is no new man. We tried so hard to create a society that was equal, where there'd be nothing to envy your neighbor. But there's always something to envy. A smile, a friendship, something you don't have and want to appropriate. In this world, even a Soviet one, there will always be rich and poor. Rich in gifts, poor in gifts. Rich in love, poor in love. Man will always have a universal longing for something more that this world cannot offer. To Danilov I would say I agree with your assessment about the human condition, but I would offer him an alternative option. The only way man can transcend his depraved condition, and break the power of sin, is to begin a personal relationship with the creator of the Universe. By throwing God out of the equation, communism eliminated the supreme standard of perfection and equality. God made the ultimate sacrifice by sending His son Jesus, as a sacrifice and remedy to our sins. You might shriek at the mention of religion, but I'm not talking about formalized religion, I'm talking about entering into a relationship with Jesus. Every man-made philosophy on life is faulty; we can never try hard enough or be good enough sin will always get in the way. When accept that we are sinners and believe that Christ's sacrifice cleansed us of our depraved conditions we become new creations. A follower of Christ is not perfect but they are changed and are on a journey to be more like Christ. In this life, utopia will never occur, but true followers of Christ become lights in a dark world spreading the good news and hope of eternal life that lies within them.

It Came from Outer Space is based on a short story written by none other than Ray Bradbury and directed by contemporary monster-master Jack Arnold (Tarantula, Creature from the Black Lagoon). Judging by the exhilarating title and promising DVD-cover, this looks like another alien invasion movie, in which evil extraterrestrials target the earth and all of its mortal inhabitants for destruction, but actually this is more like one of them films that try to make us aware that we're not alone in this universe and that we certainly shouldn't consider ourselves to be the superior race. Somewhere deep in the state of Arizona, a writer slash amateur astrologist and his girlfriend witness the crashing of something that looks like a meteor. When heading into the desert for closer investigation, John Putnam discovers that it's actually a hi-tech spaceship, but before he can show it to the rest of the community, rocks and rubble come tumbling down and nobody believes him. That's what you get when you're a fiction writer, of course. One of the alien travelers managed to leave the ship before it got buried, however, and he &#x96; or it &#x96; goes on a rampage to body snatch several of the townsfolk. Not to drain their intellect or enslave their mortal bodies, mind you, but simply to temporarily take them hostage and repair the broken ship! It Came from Outer Space is primarily a sober, progressive and thought-provoking Sci-Fi movie that criticizes the typically human ignorance, sense of paranoia and fear of the unknown.

It Came from Outer Space is based on a short story written by none other than Ray Bradbury and directed by contemporary monster-master Jack Arnold (Tarantula, Creature from the Black Lagoon). Judging by the exhilarating title and promising DVD-cover, this looks like another alien invasion movie, in which evil extraterrestrials target the earth and all of its mortal inhabitants for destruction, but actually this is more like one of them films that try to make us aware that we're not alone in this universe and that we certainly shouldn't consider ourselves to be the superior race. Somewhere deep in the state of Arizona, a writer slash amateur astrologist and his girlfriend witness the crashing of something that looks like a meteor. When heading into the desert for closer investigation, John Putnam discovers that it's actually a hi-tech spaceship, but before he can show it to the rest of the community, rocks and rubble come tumbling down and nobody believes him. That's what you get when you're a fiction writer, of course. One of the alien travelers managed to leave the ship before it got buried, however, and he &#x96; or it &#x96; goes on a rampage to body snatch several of the townsfolk. Not to drain their intellect or enslave their mortal bodies, mind you, but simply to temporarily take them hostage and repair the broken ship! It Came from Outer Space is primarily a sober, progressive and thought-provoking Sci-Fi movie that criticizes the typically human ignorance, sense of paranoia and fear of the unknown.

Jim Carrey's first starring role as Ace Ventura Pet Detective may seem obnoxious to some but to others, he is the definition of a living cartoon. Much of Carrey's humor is relied on body movements which does an excellent job at keeping the audience curious to what he really is doing.Although the character of Ace Ventura is quite rude; it's a kind rudeness because of his knowledge as a detective. There are so many parts of the film where people put down Ventura as a loser who really doesn't have an occupation because he IS the only pet detective. But he uses this to his advantage because he is also very smart aside from his wise cracks. For those people in the movie that chastise Ventura's actions, they are all proved wrong by his wit and reason.Director Tom Shadyac is brilliant for picking Carrey. It almost seems like Carrey was just told by Shadyac to do whatever you feel like doing on screen. Everything looks genuine on film and nothing looks like it was really directed. This is good though because this is how Carrey's character worked. It focused more on impulse than directionality.Co-starring with Carrey is Courtney Cox. She acts her part out well too and of course because of Carrey's antics, Cox's character and many others are forced to always be a step behind. This is what makes Ace Ventura's character so effective. To think that Ace Ventura was written into the script as just a stupid character that has no idea of what he's doing would be a complete folly. Instead of a comedy having dumb fun, Ace Ventura Pet Detective has smart fun.Ace Ventura Pet Detective may seem silly, but it is packed with intelligent dialog and unforeseen humor that no one will ever experience until being introduced to this film.

It's funny but watching it, it reminds of another two Al's movies, albeit they will be done long after first, Righteous Kill because on the same topic, you can understand why the later is a crap (totally unrealistic). Then, with Carlito's Way, because the two movies share almost the same beginning and a bearded Al that is totally connected with the streets. I don't know if Al chooses his own wardrobe but he's totally in. Another strong point of the movie is its incredible reality now, the derelict precincts and under pressure cops are seen anywhere, especially at TV (NYPD Blue for example) but at that time, it was a first. Next, the movie starts as fast as a bullet and in a few minutes, you'll understand the harsh and incredible madness of the crime reality. Being a patrolman in NYC is as hard as being a soldier fighting overseas! Not bad for a movie that was released some 30 years ago! ","genre":"Biography, Crime, Drama"}]
