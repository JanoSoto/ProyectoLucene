Due to my recent discovery of Jonny Lee Miller (where have you been, Sir?) I had to watch this film. His character, Edmund, was my favorite. He's just perfect, what more can I say? O'Connor's Fanny Price really drew me as well. Her narration kept the story light and amusing. It wasn't too serious, and I think that is why I wasn't so bored. Even though this film was released in 1999, here it is 2013 and I'm watching it for the first time and enjoying it. It is a classic sort of film that I don't think I could get tired of.It is based off of an Austen novel, which I admit, I have not read (for I found Pride and Prejudice to be painfully ridiculous and boring when I read it), but luckily the cast and screenplay made this film so I don't have to read the book!
