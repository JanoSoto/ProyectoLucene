Stick a guy in the middle of a whited-out Alaskan wilderness, hungry and lonely, his sole companion bent on eating him alive. Oh, yes, throw in a pretty woman to give him the flirt-and-desert treatment. Man, is this getting worse by the minute...What do I know? This will make a wonderful story! says the reporter on the boat at the end of The Gold Rush. And so it does. In fact, a big reason for admiring the movie is because it really does tell a good story, unusual for comedies back in the mid-1920s when they were designed just to get you from gag to chase and back.Admiration aside, The Gold Rush is impressive in another big way. It's still deliriously funny.The story An unnamed prospector called the little fellow or the tramp (Charlie Chaplin) struggles to find his fortune and just stay alive during the 1898 Alaska Gold Rush. The story forms two halves. In one, he and his friend Big Jim (Mack Swain) must stave off starvation and help Big Jim rediscover his mountain of gold. In the other, he tries to win the heart of jaded dance-hall girl Georgia (Georgia Hale).The two subplots are not only resolved, but in tandem, a neat trick for any age. At the core of the film's success is Chaplin's way as writer and director of creating empathy for his character's plight.This was not always a plus for Chaplin in my view; he was prone to overload the pathos and artistic sentiment a few times in his career. But here the sympathy we feel for the Tramp is not only genuine and earned but serves to advance the comedy, making the laughs deeper and more satisfying.Take the scene where the Tramp first makes Georgia's acquaintance, in the dance hall where she works. As an establishing shot, we see him in the foreground from the back, arm akimbo, almost totally in darkness as the two-level set in the background is brightly lit. He's obviously the guy in the corner being ignored by the merrymakers around him.Then we see Georgia's first meeting with him. She's talking about how bored she is. If I could meet someone worthwhile, she says, as he listens, awestruck. Then she turns and looks in his direction. He freezes up, but to no avail, as she looks right past him and walks on.It's funny, yes, but at the same time you feel for the guy. Film comedies have been trying to do this thing ever since, and most often they fail because they overplay the laugh or the pity. Here Chaplin nails it.The three big set pieces people talk about in the film, the Thanksgiving dinner where the Tramp eats a shoe, his dance with the dinner rolls, and the cliffhanger at the end with Big Jim in the cabin, are all bedrock moments of cinema. Yet they exist not in isolation but in tandem with everything else in The Gold Rush.So many other prize scenes here, too, like Charlie's transformation into a chicken and his racket for making money by shoveling snow from one storefront to the next. I'm at a loss as to why there was need for the nominal villain, Black Larson, who does absolutely nothing to advance the story of the film. But he does have a great comic struggle with Big Jim over a shotgun, which always manages to be aimed at the Tramp no matter where he's trying to hide.I would vote for seeing the film in its original 1925 silent state, though I don't think the 1942 version narrated by Chaplin is an atrocity. It just short-changes some of the story elements. For any comedy before The Gold Rush, such trims would be just fine, but The Gold Rush is not any comedy. It's the mother lode!

He rarely talks about Vietnam, and when he does, he talks about boot camp or his training. He won't ever talk about the battlefield. So I knew this film had to be decent because he loves it. He only likes three war films that I know of, this one, Saving Private Ryan, and Band of Brothers. Here's why this movie is amazing. 1. The movie is about an incredibly important part of history and shows how gruesome the first attack was in Vietnam. It also shows how, once again, France got us into a war that they couldn't handle. 2. It's incredibly realistic. My father thought that one scene might have been too influenced by Hollywood, until he found the actual footage of the battle. In one scene the Vietnamese soldiers just charge in aggressively and are being shot at close range by U.S. soldiers. It all looks more John Wayne then anything at first. But as the movie showed us, there was a reporter there filming the events that took place. His footage is available online. Sure enough, it shows Vietnamese soldiers doing an all out charge at the U.S. soldiers and looks just like the scene depicted in the movie. The movie showed how grueling war can be and how one quick decision can be fatal. 3. Sam Elliot. I was blown away by his take on Sgt. Plumley. Amazing. He played the part of the grumpy and pessimistic... but tough sargeant. It was almost as if they had hired a drill sargeant to do his part. 4. The movie depicts perfectly the sacrifice that the soldiers and families give up. It demonstrates that the war wasn't just in Vietnam, but it was also carried over here on the backs of soldiers and bared by the families and wives of these very soldiers. No soldier was cast as a major hero nor as some major action superstar. They were cast as soldiers, plain and simple. The movie asked for no glory, no praise, just for you to listen. As one Vietnam vet said, This is our story. 5. The music to the movie was great, especially since it was performed by the military's own. I recommend seeing this film. It's not a feel-good movie or a movie made for pure pleasure. It's made to show the story of the soldiers. It isn't meant to push a political belief nor to protest anyone.

It has a Pulp Fiction like style to it, Tarantino Esquire, so to speak, but Kevin does not have the budget, nor the entertainment value that Tarantino has. I found a lot of the dialog to be actually very crude, and not really all that funny. There is constant jokes about sexually related stuff, that starts to hit your nerves after a while. I tried my hardest not to be biased, considering i'm not a fan of Kevin Smith's at all. I did enjoy Zack&Miri Make a Porno, and due to all the praise this film has garnered over the years, I thought I would give it a try. Well I did, and I admired it's ambition, with the low budget it had, it's simply not my thing. Brian O'Halloran's Dante felt like the most real character, his friendship in the movie with Jeff Randal's Randal, was probably the best thing about this movie for me. Performances.

A triumph in the post-war period, it was virtually forgotten by the 1970s except by students of cinema. Recently, it has begun to get recognition as perhaps the most even-handed representation of soldiers' integration into post-war life ever made (and that most definitely includes films such as The Deer Hunter.) I like it, but my overall evaluation is somewhere between those extremes.The tale is a simple one. Three very different servicemen who have mustered out after World War II (The Big One!) fly home to their Midwest town and try to resume, or create, civilian lives. One has a disability, one has a cushy job waiting for him, and the other has nothing to go on but determination.There are some good but unfortunately uneven performances. Fredric March won the Best Actor Oscar for playing an old Sergeant who returns to his job at the local bank. Personally, I think Jimmy Stewart deserved it for It's a Wonderful Life, which also deserved the Best Picture Award, but clearly this film touched a nerve with the post-war audience. As I said, it was fashionable. March has one fantastic scene, a humorous speech that brought to mind somewhat similar incident involving real WWII hero Pappy Boyington, and otherwise is solid but unspectacular.I am going against the grain here, but I thought that Myrna Loy, who played March's wife, was justly ignored by the Academy. I detected barely a hint of warmth from her. In fact, I kept thinking she was going to slap Frederic March for annoying her. She practically grimaced every time they were together. Something was definitely missing there, in her forced smiles and her air of tolerance rather than joyfulness. I think all this nonsense about her being the perfect wife is correct only if you think a passionless 1950s homemaker is your ideal. You may disagree with that, but the Academy voters apparently did not. She is a major problem with this film, terribly miscast.Dana Andrews as a former soda jerk who became a war hero, then winds up behind the counter again, is amazing. He is saddled with a wife who evidently married him right before he left for the war for all the wrong reasons, and his future looks bleak. But then he chances upon March's daughter Peggy (Teresa Wright, in a fantastic turn), and fireworks explode. Both are great, but then comes that unevenness again that pervades this film. Some moments of pure soap opera intrude, punctuated by the all-time classic line, I'm going to bust that marriage up! The romance is uplifting and does mirror a common condition after the war, that of returning servicemen finding love upon their return.Speaking of uplifting, now we come to Harold Russell. He has a naturalistic quality to his acting, or is it non-acting, that rings just as true today as it no doubt did then. Taking a no-nonsense approach to his situation, he is an inspiration. His best scene, one of the best in all cinema, is when he brings the girl who likes him up to his bedroom to show her the truth of his condition. I'm lucky, I still have my elbows unlike some of the boys. Truly great stuff.The film has some moments that soar. It also has some moments that belong in the afternoon soaps.

And, like all good Irish publicans, he greeted all his customers like old friends. After the curtain came down, during Writers' Week in Listowel, there was only one place to be.The Field is generally regarded as Keane's greatest achievement. He was certainly aware of that fact and had denied it to The Southern Theatre Company (STC), who had opened all, or most, of his other works. But The Field was not Many Young Girls of Twenty and, for Keane, there was only one Bull McCabe - Ray McAnally. Keane was right to wait for McAnally. This was a portrayal of immense power and menace and McAnally literally terrified the audience, such was the intensity of his acting. One left the theater exhausted, yet exhilarated. Bad feeling followed between Keane & Jamas N Healy (Hayley as he was called), the leading actor in the STC. I knew him well & he told me that he could do Bull McCabe as well as any one. Maybe; I never saw him try it.But McAnally's performance - and I went back a second time - has been burned into my consciousness. He finally achieved the fame & honors that were long overdue and his portrayal of Harry Perkins - in A Very British Coup - must stand as one of the finest pieces of character-acting on record. But his Bull McCabe was incomparable; definitive - almost impossible to follow.I also met Richard (Dicky) Harris - a fine actor (This Sporting Life - a wonderful portrayal of macho tenderness)- and he was, perhaps fortunate that McAnally's performance had not transferred to film.But good an actor as Harris was, he missed the menace. And I am uncertain about that beard. In my experience, farmers of that period were always beardless; unshaven perhaps, but I felt that Harris looked a bit like Charlton Heston, hamming-up the division of the Red Sea on some back lot in Hollywood, & the performance lost credibility because of that. Maybe Jim Sheridan would disagree?Sorry, JJ; a good effort, but beards are for trade-union agitators; Fidel lookalikes & revivalist preachers.Not hard-working Kerry farmers.

We expect special effects and crappy plot structure from Michael Bay movies. Yet Armageddon had better plot structure than Deep Impact. Matter of fact, I wasn't all that sad about some people dying on Deep Impact. It's like watching a cheesy horror movie where everyone is stupid... and you get so sick of it that you finally just say Aw heck, just kill them will ya?. The acting was mostly awful. The plot was predictable. I remember telling my girlfriend How much you want to bet the attempt to destroy the comet will fail and the astronauts will blow themselves up in a desperate attempt to stop the comet? A few minutes later.... you guessed it. The only actor or actress who I really saw with genuine acting in this movie was Morgan Freeman. Even Robert Duvall had a lackluster performance. I thought the love story between the boy and girl was lame. The movie had all sorts of symbolism that went to waste. There was only one good thing about the movie. The music. James Horner's music was beautiful. It was so good, but yet wasted, that he practically copied the music and used it again for Bicentennial Man.

Masterfully directed by veteran director Lewis Milestone (All Quiet on the Western Front, Of Mice and Men, Mutiny on the Bounty), Ivers captures the essence of noirish cynicism and post WWII angst in spite of its happy-sappy ending and the iffy casting choice of new-comer Lizabeth Scott.The film begins with a murder on a winding staircase, involving three youths, during a proverbial dark and stormy night. Flash forward twenty years, to a weary rolling stone of a man, Sam Masterson, who left during that violent evening, returning to his hometown Iverston, and to the scene of the crime. During his first day he wrecks his car, meets an even wearier drifter, Toni, and runs into one of his old friends, Walter, who is now the District Attorney.Walter O'Neil is now a powerful man, running for a higher office and acutely aware that Sam could turn on a dime and reveal their past crime and the cover-up. However, Sam is only interested in helping his new girlfriend, Toni, get out of tangled mess of her own. Enter Barbara Stanwyck, the central character, as Martha Ivers, who has always carried a smoking torch for Sam, and is determined to keep him cozy in Iverston. Well, you get the picture, and the stage is set for plenty of suspense, revenge, double-crosses, twists, and just plain trauma-drama.Yet, what makes Ivers a classic noir? Two words &#x96; Barbara Stanwyck, the undisputed Queen of Classy Noir. Hands-down, The Strange Loves of Martha Ivers belongs hook and fang to her skill as the timeless Spider Woman archetype &#x96; ruthless, driven, and amoral &#x96; ready to bring down all around her for her own cryptic reasons. It could be for love, and it could just as easily be to savor her undisputed power, or --- ah, but that's the mystery that *is* the Spider Woman! We just don't know. But Stanwyck makes it all the more fascinating to watch and savor.Van Heflen's Sam Masterson is the perfect foil against Kirk Douglas's Walter, a man who is perfectly content to drown his sorrows in booze while watching his wife, Martha, control every aspect of his life. For every dominatrix must have her submissive, and Walter is only too happy to oblige his autocratic wife, as long as he can occasionally whine about it. Sam and Walter play a long-standing homo-erotic game of cat and mouse - subterranean feelings that are perfectly happy to stay simmering.Rossen's sub-textual theme of sadomasochism &#x96; and hence the strange loves in the title -reveals itself in the parallel relationships between Martha and Walter, and Sam and Toni. Both Walter and Toni are obviously passive lovers, allowing Martha and Sam to act out their conflicted feelings about loss and abandonment on them throughout the film. Toni at one point even gives Sam permission to physically abuse her, Go ahead and hit me, Sam. I've got it coming. But even an intriguing sexual subtext can't bring me to give The Strange Loves of Martha Ivers my Noir seal of approval. First off, Robert Rossen's brilliant screenplay cops out by having Sam and Toni drive off into the sunset, as he proposes marriage. Sadly, no moment in Noir history feels as false and phony as watching Masterson slip out of character to suddenly pop the question.The American version of Noir centered on the Spider Woman archetype, which served as not-so-subtle propaganda for working women and their male counterparts returning home from the war. Couldn't Rosie the Riveter just be happy in her ivy-covered suburban cottage, leaving the decision-making (and jobs!) to her GI Joe? Noir's warning label on the post-war message for America was skillfully encapsulated in the persona of the Spider Woman &#x96; this is what your daughters and wives will become if they continue to do a man's work! The balance of power between Man and Woman are perfectly out of balance in Ivers Martha runs the town better than any man could and Walter props it up by using the law to justify it. One imagines Walter as the Better Half, docilely awaiting Martha's return from a hard day of managing Iverston's Wall Street. Rossen's false Disneyland ending is typical when the Noir relationship construct consists of two males and two females. Toni Marachek is just another Walter, awaiting her turn at the white picket fence after all.Secondly, Lizabeth Scott's sad-sack performance as Toni Marachek is a lackluster jumble of sighs, Pollyanna clichés, and puppy-dog gazes. It's true that Rossen's Toni is only serving time in the real world of post-WWII reconstruction until her Sam can masterfully take over her life. (Hence, his last name, Masterson.) Yet most of Lizabeth Scott's future roles would reflect such one-dimensional expressions. Perhaps Scott's talents were better suited for television, but by the time Hollywood gave birth to the smaller screen venue, her sexual orientation had already been well-publicized. In retrospect, the character of Toni is a comfortable conservative appendage &#x96; hanging around and not really serving any purpose but to give Sam his reason leave Iverson, rescue Toni, and avoid Martha's compelling spider web of intrigue and sexual power plays.Such is the tangled world of Noir &#x96; ya gotta love it!

Much to my surprise, it was quite fast-paced and never seemed to lose itself in moralizing or philosophizing, although the temptation was there. The story revolves around an assignment given to a local white teenager by his black principal. The teen (Edward Furlong), whose brother was the former skinhead trying to go straight after doing time in prison, had written a book review expressing admiration for Mein Kampf. His principal (Avery Brooks) assigned him to write the story of his brother, focusing on its social significance. That angle could, as I said, have led to a lot of moralizing. Instead, it served as a springboard to a very powerful series of flashbacks detailing the brother's growing involvement in the movement and his experiences in prison that led to him turning around, as well as a bit of the story of him going straight upon his release. The brother was brilliantly played by Edward Norton. The movie is very brutal and violent at times and is frankly not for the faint of heart. It also seems that a lot happens as a result of one assignment that, as I understood the story, had to be done in one night.Director Tony Kaye made a good decision to film parts of the movie in black and white, which made a powerful statement in itself of the danger of seeing things in simplistic terms. In the end, this isn't a movie that simply attacks the white skinhead movement. It points out the problem of hate for the sake of hate, and, while focusing on the skinhead movement, the point is applicable when applied to black gang bangers or Latino gangs or any other race-based or religion-based hate movement. Hatred is a waste of time and energy - ultimately, hatred is a waste of life, a point powerfully made in the last scenes of the movie. This movie will not leave you feeling good - but that isn't its purpose. It will leave you with an understanding of the pointlessness of living by hate. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 February 2010","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Offering both a very disturbing look at the inside workings of a neo- Nazi skinhead group, as well as a powerful reflection on the redemption of one of its former leaders, this is a truly powerful movie that is both disturbing and sobering.

Instead, it served as a springboard to a very powerful series of flashbacks detailing the brother's growing involvement in the movement and his experiences in prison that led to him turning around, as well as a bit of the story of him going straight upon his release. The brother was brilliantly played by Edward Norton. The movie is very brutal and violent at times and is frankly not for the faint of heart. It also seems that a lot happens as a result of one assignment that, as I understood the story, had to be done in one night.Director Tony Kaye made a good decision to film parts of the movie in black and white, which made a powerful statement in itself of the danger of seeing things in simplistic terms. In the end, this isn't a movie that simply attacks the white skinhead movement. It points out the problem of hate for the sake of hate, and, while focusing on the skinhead movement, the point is applicable when applied to black gang bangers or Latino gangs or any other race-based or religion-based hate movement. Hatred is a waste of time and energy - ultimately, hatred is a waste of life, a point powerfully made in the last scenes of the movie. This movie will not leave you feeling good - but that isn't its purpose. It will leave you with an understanding of the pointlessness of living by hate. 8\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"2 February 2010","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Offering both a very disturbing look at the inside workings of a neo- Nazi skinhead group, as well as a powerful reflection on the redemption of one of its former leaders, this is a truly powerful movie that is both disturbing and sobering.

The original ALIEN remains one of my absolute favorite movies and the sequel, ALIENS, is still one of James Cameron's best films in my opinion. It's just a shame that the third installment couldn't continue with the same success. From everything I've read and seen, David Fincher's film was plagued with any and all possible obstacles that could possibly befall it, which contributed to the resulting mundane film. Multiple rewrites, budget issues, and crew changes nearly destroyed the film before it was ever completed, but credit is still due to David Fincher and his editor Terry Rawlings for creating a something cohesive out of all the trouble. The film begins at an undetermined amount of time after the events of ALIENS, in which an electrical fire aboard the Sulaco ejects Ripley's cryotube in an escape pod, stranding her on the planet Fiorina 161 (or Fury 161). The planet is a maximum security men's work correctional facility where the prisoners have accepted religion and are less than thrilled to have a woman wandering amongst them. Their differences are soon forgotten as Ripley discovers that an egg had stowed away aboard the escape pod and there is now an alien picking off the colony population one by one.I appreciate the fact the Fincher and the writers attempted to get back to the roots of the franchise, relying on suspenseful horror instead of action (not that Cameron's action approach was in any way unsatisfying, because it rocked). For whatever reason, this film just fell flat. The first half kept the pace with Ripley integrating into the prison population and investigating clues that she may have had a stowaway, then the arrival of the alien in it's usual gruesome manner. As soon as the initial attacks are over, the film slows to a crawl while the surviving prisoners frequently huddle together and plan how to capture or destroy the creature. Sadly, the final act suffers just as well when the prisoner's plan to kill the creature comes to fruition in a lengthy chase sequence.Sigourney Weaver, of course, reprises her role as Ellen Ripley and continues to grow stronger in the role. The best supporting cast are also, sadly, some of the shortest-lived Charles Dance (as the colony's medical officer Clemens) and Brian Glover (as superintendent Andrews). The deaths of the characters were necessary to place the prisoners in a leader-less situation so I can understand why, but it still would've been nice to get some more of Charles Dance in the film. Unfortunately, with the exception of Charles S. Dutton, the rest of the cast blends together into a sea of shaved heads and it becomes incredibly difficult at points (particularly those of high action) to distinguish who is who.

For this reason, director Brian De Palma's next big mob-themed follow-up to Scarface is quite a challenge. Capone is an enigma of sorts the closest thing to a tall tale that history has to offer. Casting Robert De Niro was an excellent choice in attempt to do the character justice, but The Untouchables, as entertaining and suspenseful as it is, never fully captures the tone and magnitude of Capone and 1930s Chicago.Feds and gangsters flick would be a better way to describe The Untouchables than organized crime drama. Anyone expecting a Godfather film or Scarface should lower those expectations to the level of '30s-themed action movie. Kevin Costner stars as Ness, leading a team of feds called The Untouchables who decide to go straight after the mob. They consist of an accountant (Charles Martin Smith) a rookie who's a good shot (Andy Garcia) and the wise veteran (Sean Connery in an Oscar-winning role).For a mostly fictitious account of Capone's arrest, you'd think De Palma would pull out all the stops and that his film would glamorize the heck out of the mob and juice up the story to make it as cool as possible. He does a lot of nice aerial shots like the very beginning and the whole cast has lots of fun with guns, but it's the characters that feel a bit cold. Costner is just okay as Ness. Yes, his character is supposed to be a moral by-the-books type who eventually embraces the slightly less legal means of getting the job done because the ends justify the means, but he could us a bit more flavor. You do like him though by the end of the film at the least.I don't know what Connery does that well to earn an Oscar. I think the Academy was like most people with regards to Connery in the '80s smitten every time he shows up on screen without a license to kill in tow. Malone is an ideal part being that he's wise, skilled and also reckless -- and David Mamet also gives him the film's best lines -- but there's nothing that suggests he's more than a likable character mold.The best scene in The Untouchables can be looked at in one of two ways either as a fantastic modern ode to a classic war film (the silent Russian film The Battleship Potemkin) or as well that was great, but it wasn't original. I'm somewhere in between. The train station stairs make a beautiful backdrop for the firefight that's not unlike the final scene of Scarface, and De Palma's slowing down of the action makes it all the more enjoyable, but there's a lingering sense of wanting something truly one-of-a-kind.What Mamet's script does best other than good action fodder is provide a sense of whether or not someone is really untouchable, whether or not the law truly protects anyone. Capone lived above the law for so long and Ness loses a ton of men in his restless pursuit, having to bend the law at times in order to continue it. Capone's arrest does suggest that we all have to answer sometime when we don't govern ourselves by a set of principles.~Steven CVisit my site at http\/\/moviemusereviews.com ","genre":null},{"date":"2 February 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The Prohibition-era fight between gangster Al Capone and G-man Eliot Ness over the streets of Chicago is the stuff of legend.

Too bad that that Robert Altman had to go all revisionist on Philip Marlowe, because a perfectly wonderful story is squandered with an annoyingly-active camera (always zooming, panning or lurking behind inanimate objects) and washed-out photography that makes it seem as though you're watching the film through frosted glass. Elliot Gould's young and cocky Marlowe is a curiosity, always mumbling some wisecrack to himself like a detached introvert, so at least the performance is interesting.As in Chandler's novel, Marlowe runs into police trouble after helping a friend (Jim Bouton) evade the authorities. His subsequent case involves tracking down missing novelist Roger Wade (Sterling Hayden), a washed-up alcoholic who abuses his beautiful wife Eileen (Nina Van Pallandt). Altman's version of the story is thoroughly abridged, and in the process loses a lot of its emotional power.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"2 February 2010","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Of the five Raymond Chandler novels I read in 2009, The Long Goodbye (1953) was the most mature and accomplished &#x96; and, indeed, probably the finest book I read throughout the year. It pains me that the early-1970s adaptation is such a disappointment, though admittedly it did spur a new cinematic interest in Philip Marlowe giving us such films as 'Farewell, My Lovely (1975)' and Polanski's very Chandler-ish 'Chinatown (1974)'. Too bad that that Robert Altman had to go all revisionist on Philip Marlowe, because a perfectly wonderful story is squandered with an annoyingly-active camera (always zooming, panning or lurking behind inanimate objects) and washed-out photography that makes it seem as though you're watching the film through frosted glass. Elliot Gould's young and cocky Marlowe is a curiosity, always mumbling some wisecrack to himself like a detached introvert, so at least the performance is interesting.As in Chandler's novel, Marlowe runs into police trouble after helping a friend (Jim Bouton) evade the authorities. His subsequent case involves tracking down missing novelist Roger Wade (Sterling Hayden), a washed-up alcoholic who abuses his beautiful wife Eileen (Nina Van Pallandt). Altman's version of the story is thoroughly abridged, and in the process loses a lot of its emotional power. Marlowe's investigative inquiries are essentially isolated fragments, without offering any insight into the characters or their motives. Marlowe himself, for example, is kept entirely detached from the mystery &#x96; even more so than Bogart in 'The Big Sleep (1946) &#x96; and, indeed, from reality itself. One of the most harrowing moments in Chandler's novel occurs when Marlowe faces a conflict between his professional integrity and his oppressive lust towards Eileen Wade. Not only does Nina Van Pallandt fail to fulfil Chandler's generous descriptions of Mrs. Wade, but Marlowe is curiously depicted, in Sherlock Holmes fashion, as an asexual.

There wasn't anything good showing, so we picked this movie. We both were in awe of how awful this movie was. The only good thing about the movie was the stunning visuals. After that, I wasn't impressed at all. Let me summarize the movie for you. This is a spoiler, so please don't listen to me if you want to see this movie. A priest is basically forced to travel on a boat to fight a vicious enemy. The enemy is a lanky green woman who looks like she's on heroin. Her warriors are people running around with buffalo heads placed on their heads. They kill the buffalo people and kill the screwed up woman. Done deal. Yep, that's the movie. No point to the movie. No good villains. No good ending. Don't waste your time on this movie. I'm surprised my date went out with me ever again.

Hollywood loves reminding us that it's a man's world, baby and I would hazard a guess that 95% of current box office offerings are male-centered (That is, male = hero, victim, anti-hero; with a female = smart talking' and lookin' and barely visible unless required to provide booty, tears, or encouragement to - you guessed it, the male!).So when a movie with a female-centered cast and theme (trivialized by the term chick flick) is served to us, I watch with a wary eye and a hopeful heart. Why? Because most chick flicks are written, directed, and produced by men...maybe that's why there are so few of them! To the credit of The Divine Secrets of The Ya-Ya Sisterhood, it didn't disappoint my heart or my head.The Ya-Ya Sisterhood takes the universal theme of mother-daughter conflict and serves it up as refreshingly as a mint julep on a scorching day. Taking place in Louisiana, this movie leads us through a merry romp of friendship and fierce loyalties, stopping along the way to tug at our heart strings and drag out the tissues (don't all good chick flicks?).The plot centers around a young director (Sandra Bullock) who is estranged from her Old School Southern Belle mother (Ellen Burstyn) and nervous about her upcoming nuptials. Through the divine intervention of the Ya-Ya's - a three woman tag-team of family friends - (played by Maggie Smith, Shirley Knight, and Fionnula Flanagan) the daughter is able to heal old familial wounds and welcome her new role as daughter, wife (and future mother).Yet, layered within this beautiful film is three levels of female experience, told through the life of Maiden-Mother-Salty Sage women Burstyn and Ashley Judd. (I'd like to see Judd get a nod at the next award show for this multi-faceted role.) Add to that a funny and tender juxtaposition of the men in their lives (James Garner and Angus MacFadyen) and everyone is sure to get their Ya-Ya's out! Unforgettable in every way!
