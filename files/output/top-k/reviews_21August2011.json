It is a comedy that does not take itself seriously, that does not pretend to be anything or send any message to the youth of the world, or be over the top, but it does get its parody of the rich and famous through without being insulting or pretentious.Clueless has a terrific script, great dialogs, and memorable characters despite the stereotypes. Most importantly, there are many funny, cheeky, sweet and naughty moments, so if you don't laugh or enjoy it, you are the problem.All the cast members are lovable and adorable in their respective roles. Paul Rudd is very charming as the sweet hard worker Josh. Alicia Silverstone has the role of a lifetime playing Cher Horowitz, and is extremely funny, as well as the almost unrecognizable Brittany Murphy as Tai; she still was herself and not a Hollywood minced product. Stacey Dash and Donald Faison are also terrific in their roles of the couple Dionne & Murray. Also very good is Elisa Donovan as Amber.Despite being filmed in 1995 the movie is still fresh, funny and very enjoyable, and only the fashion is a bit aged, but just a bit.A classic teen movie that is still fresh and funny.

I thought this should at least be interesting? Del Toro is in it? Yeah, let's watch that.The opening scene is, in my mind, a classic. It shouldn't be spoiled by trailers of people, so I'm not going to.Then the opening credits follow. They introduce us to the awe- inspiring score by Joe Kraemer, who's been composing for movies that are insulting to his dramatic abilities as a composer. The score, at that's no-one but the director's fault, practically saves a big chuck of the movie.The movie starts dragging before you realize it. But it's okay, at first, because of some truly brilliant, it's-like-Mamet-had-sex-with-Tarantino-pieces of dialog writing.There's always free cheese in a mousetrap.Karma's justice without the satisfaction. I don't believe in justice.And, my personal favoriteThe only thing you can guess about a broken down old man... is that he is a survivor. Wonderful performance by James Caan.Then you have two secondary characters (of which there are way too many in this film) Taye Diggs & White-Mexican guy. White-Mecixan Guy is the serious one. (always bad if you remember the name of the actor and not the character - no one says Brad Pitt in Fight Club, they say Tyler Durden says...) Ryan Philippe plays Parker. That name you'll remember after seeing his performance. Philippe surprised me. I only knew him from IKnow What You Did Last Summer, which was more fun-then-freight, and Cruel Intentions, a good and somewhat underrated attempt at modernizing Les liaisons dangereuses. Sarah Michelle Gellar outplays him in that one, though.But in this he squares off with Benicio Del Toro's Longbough. Del Toro I first saw in The Usual Suspects. A whole string of great work followed Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas, a short part in Snatch. that stole the entire movie, a wonderful comedic performance in the underrated Excess Baggage and of course, Traffic. An Oscar well deserved. Del Toro is the kind of actor who always stretches himself in his performances, always doing something new. In this one, he made the wise choice (suggestion to McQuarrie says IMDBtrivia) of keeping silent most of the time. Some of his facial expressions alone makes some scenes in this worth watching.So how come this movie started dragging after a good hour? It was a long wait for a shoot-out-ending which is, admittingly, fantastically choreographed and leaves the viewer with a climax to remember. But was it worth the long wait?The problem to me is that, visually, the film is quite boring most of the time. In terms of lighting, creating the mood, feel, style, what have you that a movie with this kind of script deserved. Now it's just people talking like they're living chess pieces, just there for the plot to take place.There is an occasional inspired shot, especially in the last half-hour when things start to get rolling again. All of a sudden you're paying attention again. Thanks to Dick Pope, D.o.p.Aaron Sorkin, whom McQuarrie could be if he went political, realizes his writing is basically people talking brilliantly and that he needs a competent director to make it visually interesting, fit for a film. That's why he lets others direct.McQuarrie hasn't directed a film since The Way of the Gun, but he is writing again. I enjoyed his occasional fingerprint in The Tourist, a movie I otherwise didn't enjoy at all. Let's hope him and Bryan Singer get together and do a crime movie together again. Until that day then?

Set in Texas during the 1950s, the film takes a look at a small dying town and the lives that make up the boring lives there. You have Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) who gets mixed up with a married woman (Oscar-winner Cloris Leachman) and Duane (Jeff Bridges) who keeps trying for the woman (Cybill Shepherd) he loves but instead just finds one heartache after another. As the town slowly dies these two men start to realize that there might really not be too much to their lives. It's said that Bogdanovich decided to make this film in B&W due to the suggestion by his friend Orson Welles and when watching the film you can't help but see the young director showing what he had learned from those masters who came before him. This includes Welles and of course John Ford. These two men have their footprints throughout this incredibly well-written and superbly acted drama that ranks as one of the best of its kind. The beautiful B&W cinematography really becomes an additional character because it perfectly sets the mood and atmosphere in the picture. It's as if you really can feel this town dying as well as the people who live in it. This certainly isn't a very pleasant movie to watch but what makes it so effective is how raw and powerful it is.

You have the terrific Bottoms character who gets in over his head not knowing how to deal with emotions. You have Oscar-winner Ben Johnson as the wise old man trying to old onto the past. The Leachman character is perhaps the most depressing because she's trying to recapture something she's lost. Even the Shepherd character and her mother (Ellen Burstyn) are quite remarkable. All of the actors give superb performances and you can't help but applaud the entire cast. You also have to give the director and producers credit for perfectly matching up all the roles as they certainly got one of the most impressive young casts out there.

It's as if you really can feel this town dying as well as the people who live in it. This certainly isn't a very pleasant movie to watch but what makes it so effective is how raw and powerful it is. Bogdanovich's screenplay is perfect as the characters are all given some wonderful development and you can't help but feel as if you know each one of them by the time the movie is over. Each one of the characters are so fully written that you almost feel as if each character is the star of the picture. You have the terrific Bottoms character who gets in over his head not knowing how to deal with emotions. You have Oscar-winner Ben Johnson as the wise old man trying to old onto the past. The Leachman character is perhaps the most depressing because she's trying to recapture something she's lost. Even the Shepherd character and her mother (Ellen Burstyn) are quite remarkable. All of the actors give superb performances and you can't help but applaud the entire cast. You also have to give the director and producers credit for perfectly matching up all the roles as they certainly got one of the most impressive young casts out there. The mix of new faces and veterans really paid off in the end. Add in the terrific soundtrack full of Hank Williams songs and you've really got something special. THE LAST PICTURE SHOW was daring when it was first released and that raw and fresh appeal is still on display all these years later.

It certainly is a spectacle in what missteps a movie can make.The movie is adapted from the Marvel Comics character. The movie version is almost nothing like the comics. One of the things about any adaptation is, at the very least, it should remain true to the spirit of the source. Comic Howard is rude and crude, his stories are usually social satires, and is often aware of the truth of his existence. Movie Howard is none of these things. There are rare glimpses at a more faithful Howard but the movie fails to go anywhere with them.One then has to wonder why Howard was chosen for a movie. This was back in the day when only Superman and Swamp Thing graced the screen. Long before Batman, X-Men, or Spider-Man. Howard was hardly a well-known property, sure he had a following but nothing big. If this was to adapt a comic book, why choose such a relatively obscure character? If this was a pet project, why so little faithfulness? Certainly, George Lucas could have used his Star Wars developed technology to make an interesting early X-Men or Fantastic Four film.Derived from Howard's characterization, the tone of the movie is not at all consistent. It's rated PG, though I'm not sure why. The movie goes between silly kid stuff to more adult fare. They try to have some more R stuff like drugs, alcohol, a near-sex scene, and some puppet nudity. But then they seem to water the movie down so much to keep a PG, as if they were just looking to get the Star Wars crowd to come. PG-13 had already been used so why not go for that middle ground?The best part of the movie is the visual effects. Howard's puppet is quite effective. In this day and age, CGI can do anything and everything but even the best creatures look like they were made in a computer. I always find it refreshing to watch an older movie and see some practical creature effects like Chewbacca, Jabba the Hutt, or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle. Seeing a Howard that actually exist in the world he's supposed to be in looks good. Plus, the stop motion at the end actually works for the whole alternate universe Dark Overlord thing since that was really not supposed to fit in. But that's about it for the good.The acting can be viewed as either over-the-top campy or simply uninspired. The only standout is Chip Zien as the voice of Howard. He's the only one really trying, even if he isn't given much to work with. There's a reason Lea Thompson hasn't been popular outside of Back to the Future, and this shows why. She's mostly going through the motions. Jeffrey Jones and Tim Robbins are both so over the top to the point of making fun of themselves. The story is nothing interesting. Again, given the source you'd think it would be more interesting. It's your typical fish, or duck if you will, out of water story. Except that he and the world adjust to each other a little too quickly. The love story between Howard and Beverly is weak at best. And every scene with the Dark Overlord seems like you need some drugs in your system to fully appreciate. If anything, it's just an example of the over-the-top goofiness we got from many 80s movies.If you think about the movie, you won't enjoy it. There's simply too many problems with it. As a whole, it may just be campy enough to enjoy. Is it one of the worst movies ever made? Certainly not, there are far worse movies out there. Is it the worst comic book movie? Perhaps, but in today's age it's got competition from Jonah Hex and Fantastic Four.Watch it and see for yourself. Cause there is really no way anyone can describe it to you.

To be accepted as a film noir, a movie must be dark on the screen as well as in story. An example of how this works is the Hitchcock picture Vertigo, which for all its cynical, fate-riddled plot should be thought of as archetypal noir, but it is rarely called one because it is shot in blazing Technicolor. Out of the Past on the other hand is a prime example of how story and style can be melded to make the very epitome of everything film noir conjures up.After Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon and Philip Marlowe in The Big Sleep, the private investigator thriller was practically a subgenre in its own right. Even though the term film noir was not yet known in Hollywood, there is very little about Out of the Past that was not already a cliché. But cliché can be good, if it's done well. Three things make this particular cliché-fest stand out. First is the snappy, quotable dialogue; a mile away from anything people say in real life, but realism was never the purpose of these things. Second a perfect and to-the-point balancing of events. Flashbacks can often be awkward, gimmicky things, but the one in Out of the Past has enough substance to be a story-within-a-story, but is just about short enough to prevent it from unbalancing the bulk of the picture. And finally there is the payoff in the final scene, a moment of poignancy rare in film noir, and one that offers a tiny crumb of comfort without detracting from the general mood of despair.Now let's look at the contribution of director Jacques Tourneur. He displays (in all his movies, even the Westerns) a kind of tight, enclosed look, but one that owes very little to German Expressionism. It is based around placing things in the foreground, often half-on and half-off the screen. Actual close-ups are rare, but there is nevertheless a constant feeling of closeness, with characters squared up around the frame as if their elbows should be rubbing against the screen. Often the focal point is a little deeper in the shot, and Tourneur pulls some brilliant tricks with layers of depth. One example is where Kirk Douglas is questioning Robert Mitchum in a restaurant. As Douglas becomes a little more aggressive and the dialogue becomes more relevant to the plot, the scene becomes visually more arresting, with a waiter tidying up in front of the actors and a family getting up and leaving behind them. Most directors will use framing to draw our eyes one way or another, but Tourneur does it so starkly and firmly just by a simple arrangement, such as the fence that leads away diagonally from the screen to Mitchum and Virginia Huston when he drops her off. Our attention is being forced but everything still looks natural. Tourneur's is a style that is hard on the eye without actually looking overtly stylised. Out of the Past was one of the earliest leading roles for Robert Mitchum, and he wears the part like a glove. His acting is not exceptional here, but he fits in very well. Apparently doing very little, he gives off a kind of atmosphere that is as bleak as the images. His movements, subtle and sporadic as they, are in time with the rhythm of the whole piece. His co-star Jane Greer &#x96; not an especially prominent movie actress &#x96; is also wonderfully understated, keeping the size of her performance below the level of melodrama, breaking through with steely emotion here and there with exceptional control. No-one else in the cast especially stands out, but they really aren't so supposed to &#x96; they are supposed to be part of the general pattern.There is little else to say that Out of the Past makes for a satisfying and enjoyable watch. Cinema is both a storytelling and an aesthetic medium, and it works best when the one angle complements the other.

But Sturges was hemmed in by the Code and the Coens had far more freedom of expression to act. The reason that this film is set in an idealized version of the Fifties so that a popular fad of a simple product could be worked into the plot as an integral part of the story line. With no more worlds to conquer after a report that his company Hudsucker Industries is richer than ever, President and founder Charles Durning takes a running start out of the board meeting and plunges 44 stories to his demise. A spectacular exit to say the least.But it's left the board who are just yes men with a real problem. Durning owned 87% of the stock so his word was law. And his will specified within 30 days that 87% was to be put on the open market and sold to any and all on the Stock Exchange. That leaves these guys in a real jam.But second in command Paul Newman has a Capra villain solution to the problem.

Oliver Stone addressed the duality of men in Platoon, Stanley Kubrick showcased breeding insanity versus the will to stay alive in Full Metal Jacket, and Francis Ford Coppola presented a mind-bending insight into war as an illusionary trip. And while my personal favourite among these films changes regularly, one thing I am sure of is that they are all masterpieces, and Apocalypse Now, for this week at least, may be the best of the lot.Martin Sheen is Captain Ben Willard, tasked with the covert mission of venturing deep into the jungles of Cambodia to locate and assassinate Colonel Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando). Kurtz, a once-promising soldier, has since abandoned the needs of his country and gone completely insane, setting himself up as a god among a native tribe and ruling with dictatorial brutality. The movie is more road trip than firefight, but I don't mean to sound condescending at all. Most of the film consists of Willard and his small group of soldiers making the trek to Kurtz's stronghold, encountering bizarre characters and scenarios along the way. The most prominent of these is Lieutenant Kilgore (Robert Duvall, rounding up the Godfather reunion), a surfie soldier who'd be terrifying if he weren't so welcoming. It is from this point onwards that Apocalypse Now transcends the standard parameters of a war film and becomes a hallucinogenic cinematic experience. Many scenes convey such unique, unheard-of aspects of war that they leave you wondering whether what you just saw was real, or an alternate perception of reality seen through the eyes of the drug-taking soldiers. Visual bewilderment is on high supply during the set action pieces as well, with their abrupt ending having the effect of taking repeated blows to the head, then having to get back up as quickly as possible.But the otherworldly nature of the film is best reflected in the cinematography and sound. Deep shades of orange, gold and purple engulf almost every moment, and the sparing yet effective use of superimposed imagery compounds the eeriness. As for audio, it is easy to point to the excellent use of Ride of the Valkyries during Kilgore's air raid, but that is just scratching the surface. A haunting half-electronic, half-orchestral score dominates the rest of the film, while extracts of The End (by The Doors, a band that has always had a strange resonance with the Vietnam War) complete a flawless technical display.As Willard and Kurtz meet for the first time, Apocalypse Now goes into thematic overdrive. Most obvious is the old notion that absolute power corrupts absolutely. As the film progresses, we learn that Kurtz's desire to return home diminishes in contrast with his growing godly stature. But the film goes on to raise all sorts of questions regarding vanity and pride in the self, as well as the moral implications of death, and if it can accepted in certain circumstances.Finally, I feel obliged to mention an event towards the end of the movie, without giving away any major plot points. The climax is intercut with the infamous real-life slaughter of a water buffalo, which occurs in a most inhumane manner. Whether Coppola was justified in his actions (by simply filming an event that was going to be carried out by the natives anyway) depends on which sources you choose to believe. From a purely cinematic perspective, though, it compliments the climax in spectacular fashion. But just as concerning is the aftermath. As the characters that continue to live ponder their actions, the ending is ambiguous in the way that we, as the audience, can only imagine how the evils they have seen will torture them long after the film's events have ended.

Are fans of a certain director actually interested in seeing absolutely everything in their filmography? Answering these questions is probably easier with a movie lover in mind, but is a bit more difficult if you consider a casual moviegoer. A director like Stanley Kubrick is best known for films like A Clockwork Orange, 2001 A Space Odyssey, and The Shining, but Kubrick dabbled in crime and film-noir long before he gained any recognition from anyone. The Killing is just that; film-noir that is one of Kubrick's first full-length features before he was ever even a blip on the radar.One of the more intriguing aspects of The Killing is that it features a nonlinear narrative. It's told out of chronological order. A good portion of both Quentin Tarantino's and Christopher Nolan's résumés are filled with nonlinear films. The story takes something simple and puts a slightly complicated spin on it. The film revolves around a robbery at a racetrack, which sounds straightforward enough. The way The Killing gets you to that point is something unique though. You're continuously strung along as Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) masterminds this elaborate plan that takes more than half the film just to set up and get all the right people together. There is so much riding on the plan going right and such an emphasis on the money everyone is going to receive if they pull it off that you expect something bad to happen when it finally comes time for everyone to play their part. The film gives you all the players up front though. All the cards are on the table as far as whose involved is concerned, but the robbery and its aftermath is where the payoff truly lies.It was interesting being able to see a character walk through a house in one continuous shot without walls obstructing our view. The ability to go through walls thanks to the way the sets were built gives you an interesting perspective. There's also another scene where George (Elisha Cook Jr) is first shown talking to his wife Sherry (Marie Windsor). They re-locate themselves several times during the scene in the same room, but the camera is always strategically placed to make you feel like you're sitting right next to them and actively part of their conversation. The digital restoration can probably take credit for this, but I don't think I've ever seen a film this old look this good. The film may be lacking color, but it's still crisp and clear. The lighting is fantastic, especially in the scene where the clown mask comes into play during the robbery.I've always had this thing about gangsters. I think a lot of people do otherwise gangster movies and the crime genre in general wouldn't be as popular as it is. But that cliché gangster voice is just incredibly entertaining to me. It just reminds me of Rocky and Mugsy from Looney Tunes. The Killing is filled with guys that talk like that and it's incredible. The narration just made it feel all the more genuine, which is odd since apparently Kubrick hated adding the narration into the film. That criminal atmosphere just speaks to you in ways other films don't. There's quite a bit of dialogue in the film that does the same. It'll probably sound dated to most, but that's the way gangsters should sound. Standin' outside the door measuring the keyhole, and That's a pretty head you got on your shoulders. You wanna keep it there or carry it around in your hands? are things you'd never hear anyone say these days.As Johnny Clay first has everyone gathered and they're discussing the plan for the robbery, there's this big round table discussion. It's littered with booze, chain-smoking, and wise guys getting slapped in the face. It's fantastic. But the way the scene is filmed, the way it makes you feel like you have to lean this way or the other to see around somebody else's head to get a glimpse of whoever's talking, is very reminiscent of the war room scenes in Dr. Strangelove.The Killing isn't going to change your mind on what your favorite Stanley Kubrick film is.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Film-Noir"},{"date":"21 August 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" How often do people actually seek out the early works of well-known directors? Are fans of a certain director actually interested in seeing absolutely everything in their filmography? Answering these questions is probably easier with a movie lover in mind, but is a bit more difficult if you consider a casual moviegoer. A director like Stanley Kubrick is best known for films like A Clockwork Orange, 2001 A Space Odyssey, and The Shining, but Kubrick dabbled in crime and film-noir long before he gained any recognition from anyone. The Killing is just that; film-noir that is one of Kubrick's first full-length features before he was ever even a blip on the radar.One of the more intriguing aspects of The Killing is that it features a nonlinear narrative. It's told out of chronological order. A good portion of both Quentin Tarantino's and Christopher Nolan's résumés are filled with nonlinear films. The story takes something simple and puts a slightly complicated spin on it. The film revolves around a robbery at a racetrack, which sounds straightforward enough. The way The Killing gets you to that point is something unique though. You're continuously strung along as Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) masterminds this elaborate plan that takes more than half the film just to set up and get all the right people together. There is so much riding on the plan going right and such an emphasis on the money everyone is going to receive if they pull it off that you expect something bad to happen when it finally comes time for everyone to play their part. The film gives you all the players up front though. All the cards are on the table as far as whose involved is concerned, but the robbery and its aftermath is where the payoff truly lies.It was interesting being able to see a character walk through a house in one continuous shot without walls obstructing our view. The ability to go through walls thanks to the way the sets were built gives you an interesting perspective. There's also another scene where George (Elisha Cook Jr) is first shown talking to his wife Sherry (Marie Windsor). They re-locate themselves several times during the scene in the same room, but the camera is always strategically placed to make you feel like you're sitting right next to them and actively part of their conversation. The digital restoration can probably take credit for this, but I don't think I've ever seen a film this old look this good. The film may be lacking color, but it's still crisp and clear. The lighting is fantastic, especially in the scene where the clown mask comes into play during the robbery.I've always had this thing about gangsters. I think a lot of people do otherwise gangster movies and the crime genre in general wouldn't be as popular as it is. But that cliché gangster voice is just incredibly entertaining to me. It just reminds me of Rocky and Mugsy from Looney Tunes. The Killing is filled with guys that talk like that and it's incredible. The narration just made it feel all the more genuine, which is odd since apparently Kubrick hated adding the narration into the film. That criminal atmosphere just speaks to you in ways other films don't. There's quite a bit of dialogue in the film that does the same. It'll probably sound dated to most, but that's the way gangsters should sound. Standin' outside the door measuring the keyhole, and That's a pretty head you got on your shoulders. You wanna keep it there or carry it around in your hands? are things you'd never hear anyone say these days.As Johnny Clay first has everyone gathered and they're discussing the plan for the robbery, there's this big round table discussion. It's littered with booze, chain-smoking, and wise guys getting slapped in the face. It's fantastic. But the way the scene is filmed, the way it makes you feel like you have to lean this way or the other to see around somebody else's head to get a glimpse of whoever's talking, is very reminiscent of the war room scenes in Dr. Strangelove.The Killing isn't going to change your mind on what your favorite Stanley Kubrick film is. It will, however, reveal that Kubrick had a unique vision of cinema even when he was first starting out. With a compelling cast, an engrossing story, and a straightforward but completely satisfying conclusion, The Killing is incredibly solid from beginning to end.

It wasn't until 2001 when Potterheads' dreams came true, and the book's film adaptation came out, sending fans to the cinemas in droves. Since the film's release and foretold box office success, the series has gone on to have the whole book series adapted, including the most successful adaptation, the newest one, Deathly Hallows Part 2. Since all the movies are out, I figured it would be nice to let my inner Potterhead put the nostalgia to the test. Let me start off by that Harry Potter has played a big part in my life. I've been a fan since 1999, when my aunt sent me the first book for Christmas. I had no idea what Harry Potter was at the time, and furthermore, the book was my first big read, so as you could imagine, opening the pages and reading the first few sentences, I was immediately hooked. Every time a book came out, I was frantic to get it. I saw every movie on their respective opening day, and own every movie on DVD, and recently rebought them on blu-ray. As of a recent rewatching, this movie, I will say, is a solid adaptation that, at the time, was considered the Watchmen of fantasy novels, in the fact that it was unfilmable. For the most part, Columbus did a solid job with the source material. However, if one thing holds the movie back, it seems as if he was trying too hard to make it perfect. I think anyone who hasn't read the book will be lost on what's happening, as a result. Dint get me wrong, this movie is indeed very good in terms of being a solid adaptation. I think, however, Columbus could have done a better job at making it a bit more cinematic.The acting, for a mostly kid anchored cast, is excellent. Daniel Radcliffe was a little kid back when this was going on, nobody thought he'd go on to be the little actor who stole audiences hearts worldwide. He really did a fantastic job with the role. He essentially leaped from the pages of the book, he's that good. The supporting cast do as good a job as said Radcliffe. Rupert Grint was probably the cutest member of the cast! He was just charming and quirky as the dimwitted but ever so funny Ron. Emma Watson was extremely cute as Hermione, and man, her performance is almost like she really is Hermione in real life! Let's not forget to mention Tom Felton who apparently didn't read the book, yet excelled as Draco, and Matthew Lewis as the naive but charming Neville Lonottom. Speaking of which, it's worth it to mention how he's grown up so much. I'm not gay, but seriously, LOOK AT MATTHEW LEWIS NOW. He is GORGEOUS. Honestly, I'm not gay at all, but it's so hard to believe he went from being a pudgy kid to an extremely handsome grown adult. In fact, the entire cast have grown up so much, it's unbelievable. In addition, the cinematography in the film is brilliant. From the films gorgeous opening shots of Privet Drive to the vibrant colour of Hogwarts, this is one of the most visually gorgeous shots ever.While watching the blu-ray, one word rang through the back of my head, soft. The image quality is simply not what it could have been. Mind you, this was shot on a considerably lower budget than the rest of the lot. And this is the best looking the movie will be. Some shots looked fantastic, others looked like Sharon Osbourne did the transfer. Also, either it's just me or there was a major adjust in F-stop in the Quidditch scene. The Audio is a nice mix, though, as there is a lot of oomph in John Williams' score, as well as the sound effects simply sound more epic. The special features, though, are exactly the same as the DVD. You'd think they'd have brought some more features in for the blu-ray, but come on.In short, apparently at the time, in 2007 WB didn't screen this blu ray for blu ray review sites. It's not hard to see why. As for the movie, it's a good start, but there was a lot more to come. Still, a must see nonetheless.

Apart from the values of team spirit , cudgeled by Gene Hackman into his rebel group , the film is full of feats , suspense , and thrills . Rough Hackman is good as leader of the motley pack together to thwart enemy camp , as well as the largely secondary cast with special mention to Randall Tex Cobb and Patrick Swayze . Atmospheric and exciting musical score by James Horner and appropriate cinematography filmed by cameraman Stephen Burum in several locations from Bangkok, Thailand ; Hanalei, Kaua'i, Hawaii, USA (Vietnam rice paddy);Indian Dunes, California, USA (Texas training camp); Lumahai Valley, Kaua'i, Hawaii, USA (Laotian POW camp). This is is a wartime typical vehicle and into the ¨ Vietnam war genre¨ and regarding ¨rescue commandos¨, which also belong  ¨Rambo II¨ , and ¨Colonel Braddock¨ trilogy with Chuck Norris , all of them dealing with relentless soldiers attempting to free some American people still held prisoners in a far prison camp into Vietnam . Although the movie has some aspects a little tough to take , this moving film still has its fine moments getting an adequate atmosphere with agreeable results , furthermore grossed lot of money at the box office .

We want to be thrilled and have our wonderment, our inquisitiveness fed in large does where we can get it. Enter the Puppet Masters. I would have preferred a better title for this movie, but this one is very accurate and will do. This movie will allow you to see a lesser form of life but equally intelligent in its own way and try to dominate our species playing by our rules and on our playing field. What you will see is how well they go about it methodically making advancements and that is what successful war or invading your enemy is all about. These Alien play to win and we play to lose until we figure out this isn't a play over game if you lose. The acting brings it all close to home and the plot is easy to follow. The story is targeted to any age group and intriguing. To observe Aliens who use their brains instead of their weaponry leaves one frightened. It mentally and emotionally assaults mankind because we know we are the superior being on this planet. For something less in appearance to invade us and succeed is truly frightening not to mention a wake-up call. This was worthy of being a full blown move with a sequel and a prequel potential. I watch it with captions on because I like to hear every word spoken when the Aliens and the humans have a face to to face. Waste no more time reading this review...go watch the movie right now ","genre":null},{"date":"21 August 2011","score":"","review":" What we are looking for in Sci-fi is a good story that enables us to join in.
