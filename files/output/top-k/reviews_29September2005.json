The ranting of previous reviewers indicates the movie touched a nerve. I have seen really, really bad movies and Red Dawn is certainly not as bad as the ratings it has received here.As is so often the case, many previous reviewers are criticizing the film because its premise conflicts with their political philosophy. I wonder how they would have rated this film had the characters been teen-aged members of an all-black football team who become partisans fighting bigoted southern whites in a 1960s civil war that never occurred. Would they be so harsh if the movie were about a group of teenage Jewish soccer team members fighting the Nazis in World War II? they might not have rated it nine or 10 stars but I'd bet they would have given it more than one star. Given the current political climate, they might even receive it more warmly if the characters were Iraqi teenagers fighting Americans.I understand the temptation to judge movies based on your own preferences rather than the movie's own merits. I recently watched Easy Rider for the first time and absolutely could have kicked myself for wasting the two hours or so it took the silly drivel to play out. Were I to rate it strictly on the way I felt about the movie -- the silly situations at the commune where 50 hippies are supposed to live all winter on about a half acre of wheat, about enough to produce a loaf of bread, the laborious acid dropping scene, the cartoonishly villainous red necks, the lame acting (other than Nicholson) -- I guess I'd have to give it about a one-star rating. But it was a beautifully filmed movie and it obviously spoke to people at that time. So a more valid assessment from my perspective would be that it's an anachronism that seems a bit silly today but obviously had merit in context.I believe Red Dawn touched something in young people of the mid-80s in the same way Easy Rider touched young people in the late 60s. Sift through the silliness of both movies and you find something people were looking for. Prior to this movie, young people were told that if World War III came, they would either be swallowed by an irresistible communist onslaught or fried in a matter of seconds by a nuclear explosion. Red Dawn said to them, If the time comes, you will not be helpless. You will fight back and win. It was an entirely unique message at the time and one people were longing to hear. In fact, The United States was already fighting back and won it's greatest victory over its most formidable foe without direct armed conflict and bloodshed because of visionary and resolute political leadership.From the time of its release until today, Red Dawn has been roundly criticized for the implausibility of the plot. It's quite true that the communist bloc was not capable of a successful invasion of the United States in 1984. But for those who failed to grasp this, Red Dawn was not a documentary. The prologue establishes the circumstances under which the invasion occurred and the action that proceeds from that premise is possible. Would communist troops shoot up a school? Their battle record indicates that if they saw it as or mistook it for a tactical objective, they most certainly would. Would they shoot civilians? Is there anybody out there so ignorant to suggest they wouldn't?Good Points about Red Dawn *The action sequences are well done and look realistic. For instance, there's a scene where a plane drops a bomb. You see the fireball first and then hear the sounds. That's a nice, realistic touch. *The actors handle their weapons properly *Beautiful photography *There's some good chemistry between some of the actors *The outcome is typical of what happens in partisan fighting. Partisans typically enjoy initial success because of surprise and knowledge of the terrain. But they usually eventually succumb to better-trained, better-equipped troops *I liked the musical scoreBad points about Red Dawn *The communists are a tad too stupid for too long *The use of horses is a stretch. *Some of the teenage high-fiving and exuberance will make you groan *Some (but not all) of the dialog and acting is awfully stiffIn short, it's an action picture that will entertain people who like action pictures. It has a unique plot line that has now become an anachronism. At it takes a jab at one of Hollywood's scared cows, communism which is refreshing. Nobody should be ashamed of making it, acting in it or enjoying watching it.Politically, the real question is not why Hollywood made a film like Red Dawn. It is rather, why did 50 years of totalitarian communist oppression spawn so few films critical of communism? Why are there seemingly scores of movies about McCarthyism and none about the Soviet gulag system? Schindler's List shows that Hollywood can make an incredible film, a film so compelling you can't take your eyes off of it, about something so horrible you can hardly bear to think about it. Stalin's body count exceeds Hitler's yet there is no Schindler's List for the Gulag. And that is something to be ashamed of.

Why? Mainly because it is John Wayne's last, and it is packaged and delivered with that thought in mind. John Wayne was clearly anticipating his own real-life demise here, and on a very fundamental level that's what the movie is all about.But don't go in thinking that this is merely some kind of schmaltzy gimmick, a movie made just for the purpose of paying corny homage to John Wayne. It stands as a fine movie in its own right, well-written and well-acted. In fact, it may be John Wayne's overall finest performance (and you can put me down as one who considers the man to have been a talented actor), especially given that he was in considerable real-life discomfort and pain throughout filming. The story is chock-full of pearls of wisdom and memorable lines. It is also chock-full of symbolism on many levels, about history and the final days of the settling of the west, about movies and the end of the western genre in Hollywood, and, of course, about John Wayne personally, facing death, and of how he would be remembered --and exploited-- in death. All that and more is finely woven into the story, and few tricks were missed. As I said, well written.**SPOILER ALERT**One striking piece of symbolism was the exact manner of death of Wayne's character, the notorious gunslinger J.B. Books. In a prearranged a face-to-face simultaneous meeting with three of his worst enemies, a dying Books intended to fight them all at once to the death. Advised by his doctor that he was going to die a suffering death from the cancer that was eating his insides, Books presupposed that not even he could face down three these formidable foes at once and prevail. Books's own personal death with dignity. But then, against all odds, Books proceeds to out-duel and kill each, the message seeming to be that the even most difficult of life's tasks can be faced and conquered if done forthrightly and in earnest. Meanwhile, it was the sneaky bartender, symbolic of life's vices, that got him, shooting him in the back when he wasn't looking and not expecting it. And when you think about it, that's what took down John Wayne too. His vices. And while maybe he should have been expecting it, maybe he wasn't. Just like many of us aren't thinking about our mortality while we partake in the enjoyment of our vices.Another compelling aspect of the film is the stellar cast that was assembled. It reads like a veritable who's who.

As an accustomed cinema audience, who never expects a Hollywood film to tell about real life, I had prejudices about Modern Times before watching it. But all my prejudices have cleared out with an unexpected astonishment in the first scene of the film a flock of sheep moving ahead with a strong and obvious oblivion compared to a huge group of labor at a rush hour peak. There could not be a more honest and brave way of explaining such a message if the modernity, technology and the ambition for more money, that is 'Modern Times' turn the people into industrialized, standard and identical creatures, and make them forget their humanity; the society that they constitute will not be a society, but a herd. Just for this first scene, I can claim that there can hardly be such a film, which knows and explains what it wants to say without any fear of all the world powers watching.First of all, we watch the Modern Times through the life of Charlie Chaplin as the Little Tramp who works in a factory assembly line and the gamine who is terribly poor and has to live in the streets. Between these two, the audience cannot decide which one to have pity for Tramp is in a better condition compared to the gamine; at least he earns money and has clothes to wear on. The gamine seems to be in a terrible condition with her bare feet and dirty face. On the other hand, she has something that Tramp does not have her own willpower that she can use to choose what she wants to live. In contrast, Tramp even does not have a chance to go to toilet comfortably, because he is seen as a machine- a part of the assembly line he is working - by the system, and a machine can not go to even a toilet. The system, or the Big Brother as the icon of the system in the film, believe that making the production more effective goes on the way of turning the labor into machines. In his opinion, effectiveness of production only means 'producing as fast as possible'. You can increase the speed of a machine by using its buttons, but what about labor? At this point, the Big Boss chooses to see and behave the labor as machines. The way he gives his orders not physically but through the technology- those big screens and especially in the scene of the feeding machine, we can clearly see the mistake of the system about the labor class working 'with' the machines does not make them machines.With the fact that Modern Times was shot nine years after the speaking films have started, it becomes even more interesting to see that Little Tramp still does not talk. We cannot say that this film is a totally silent film, because we hear voices and some specific people talking. But these specific people are the ones who have social status and power. Just as in the real life, we can hear only the powerful people of the capitalist system in the film. This is a genius contrast, because this film was made to be the voice of the people- the labor, the poor, the gamine - who do not have the chance to talk in real life as much as the boss, the rich- people who belong to the upper levels of society due to their monetary power. On the other hand, they still cannot talk even in this film, which is their voice. By this way, the Modern Times becomes the 'quiet scream' of those people, which makes this film even more dramatic and stronger. Another contrast is that when we hear the voices of those specific characters, such as the Big Boss and the feeding machine company, we do not directly hear them talking. Their voices come to us through an artificial tool, such as the big screens, the loudspeakers and the radio. As the age of technology, this is another criticism made to Modern Times. With all those tools that are named as technology, Modern Times kills our humanity. It becomes a barrier in front of us that hinders our communication and empathy. That is why the bosses start to see their labors as machines. That is a trick that Modern Times has made us since the day it was born to kill the consciousness of being a human.To conclude, the movie Modern Times will certainly have its place in the cinema history, as one of the most brave and honest films, which warn the humanity against the danger of 'Modern Times' turning into 'Mean Times', that may bring unconscious, standardized societies full with people who have turned into easily controllable sheep.

It's been about five years since I've seen Godzilla 1998 (hereafter G98), but I generally have favorable memories of it. No, G98 is not a masterpiece; it has its flaws, but it is far from being an abomination. The movie's major strength and flaw simultaneously is Pseudo-Godzilla himself(or is it herself-oh androgyny!). As a mythic force of nature, it falls short; it is vulnerable to heavier artillery, it is not wantonly destructive, and it deigns to stoop to Tatopoulos's (Matthew Broderick's) level (like a man wishing to communicate with an ant). As a super-beast, Pseudo-Godzilla is more impressive; it is extremely powerful, lithe, agile, clever, and tenacious in self-defence and of its raptor-like brood. I think the decision to cast Pseudo-Godzilla as a plausible animal with plausible animal behaviors, instead of, well, as a God Lizard was G98's major fatal flaw.When Pseudo-Godzilla is striding across New York, one feels a frisson of awe; he's so tall all you see are his muscular legs trampling across the street. But, the problem is, this Pseudo-Godzilla is apparently agoraphobic; he prefers to burrow and live in subterranean passages (although as an irradiated iguana, instead of say, a Gila monster, it's not really built for digging). Instead of terrorizing the world, all this titan wants to do is eat fish (again, not part of a herbivorous iguana's diet) and raise its young. Like a zookeeper using a steak to rouse a sleeping lion so the visitors aren't disappointed, Tatopoulos and the military employ fish mounds to entice the lizard to the surface. In short, Pseudo-Godzilla is not the supernatural monster summer audiences anticipated, but a simple creature that is monstrous only by accident.Therefore, in my opinion, I believe that to get the most out of this guilty pleasure of a movie, pretend that the creature is not Godzilla, but instead, say, the more prosaic Beast from 20,000 fathoms. Then one can appreciate the thrilling set-pieces more thoroughly. Also, to compensate for Pseudo-Godzilla's relatively scanty screen time, take the banalities the human cast utters with a block of salt, block any comparisons to Jurassic Park in savoring the infant Godzilla sequence, and commend Tatopoulos for his ruse in leading Pseudo-Godzilla to his Waterloo. I am aware this involves some intelligence dampening, but again G98 was always intended as a roller coaster sensation machine, which it succeeds in being to some degree, certainly more so than the outlandish dubbed Toho schlockfests of the last four decades or so.In conclusion, to paraphrase a former acquaintance who saw G98 in the theater with me, it's not Godzilla, but it's fairly good.

That of course doesn't stop its fame, for it has another pull that keeps it alive for years before it becomes embraced fully a nice helping of controversy, both with the outrageous techniques and the, uh, political commentary.Today, we have a film that will never die and shouldn't. Breaking traditions in more ways than one, Welles has assembled celluloid with more poetry than what has come to be expected of cinema both then and now. Still, poetry isn't always liked, and contemporary audiences may have issue with the general dullness of the story, for after all, the career of Welles and the controversy of the film are sparks and explosions, the Rosebud mystery is the intrigue, and the importance is the art-value, but the movie itself trudges along, hardly leaving room for any entertainment.Part of this is intentional, and used to great effect. The movie is, after all, about failure, and regardless of how many times we watch it, it is begun and end with No Trespassing. One problem modern audiences may definitely have is understanding that this film doesn't even pretend to answer its own mystery, despite the so-called revelation at the end. It's an exploration film where the exploration is the finale, without goal. Because of the perfection of the failure theme, the movie leaves the audience just as empty as the characters... and then what is the audience supposed to do with it? Thus, it all becomes a matter of approach. This film should be seen, but it doesn't necessarily have to be appreciated. It's worthy of its place as a critically-acclaimed classic, and yet it's still debatable whether it is worth it.--PolarisDiB ","genre":"Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"29 September 2005","score":"13 out of 17 people found the following review useful","review":" Most of the negative comments about this film seem to come from its birth place, Australia.

Terry Lambert, played by Steve Guttenberg in what may just be his best performance, is a good man whose judgment isn't always the greatest. Terry is a business executive who makes the unwise decision of having an affair with his boss's wife, a beautiful french woman named Sylvia.

Later, after learning of a different female being murdered near the scene that same night, he decides he'll go forward and report that he was the witness.

So, the only chance to convict the assailant is to prosecute on the assault case. The logic being it at least gives the authorities a chance to put the killer away to prevent him from hurting anyone else, while still hoping to find evidence connecting him to the murder. So Terry must testify during the trial that he witnessed the assault. In a brilliant scene, the defendant's attorney carves him up like an overcooked turkey, making it very clear that Terry is lying, but not why.As the authorities become suspicious of Terry, he begins to bond, through shared experience, with Denise, the woman who was assaulted outside his apartment.

Although there were, of course, certain artistic liberties drawn (as with any film based on actual events), David Lynch respects Joseph Merrick enough not to present him as a monstrous caricature of a man. (You may be wondering why I do not refer to Joseph Merrick as John Merrick...well, his real name was actually Joseph, but was changed for the film as its screenplay was based on correspondence letters between Dr. Frederick Treves and Joseph. For some reason, he altered Joseph's name in the letters to John at some point in time. No one's sure why.) John\/Joseph Merrick had a rare disease called Proteus Disease, a congenital condition. It made him appear hideously deformed and unrecognizable as a man.Of course, in today's age of scientific reasoning, Joseph would have been provided with great care; however, in 19th century Victorian England there was still a heavy reliance upon superstition and, to a certain extent, religious influence upon the public's perception. Because Joseph was so disfigured, everyone figured he was either being punished by God or he was a murderous monster. (In fact, at one time he was a potential suspect in the Jack the Ripper killings in Whitechapel, based simply on his physical appearance. It's actually an interesting theory they proposed - that he had taken out his sexual frustration upon prostitutes who rejected him - but the simple fact remains that no one in Joseph's condition could have ever managed to perform those murders. Still, it's an interesting addition to the legend and John\/Joseph can even be seen briefly in the Johnny Depp film From Hell, which is based upon the Jack the Ripper case.) John Hurt does a truly wonderful job portraying Joseph Merrick. His performance is captivating because it hints at innocence beneath the hideous appearance - proving the age-old saying beauty lies on the inside...it's a touching performance and one of the few that brought me close to tears. For what it's worth, as convincing as the makeup effects are in this film, the real Joseph Merrick was far worse looking. There is actually a picture available on Google Image search; if you take the liberty of looking for it, you may be shocked.The real Joseph Merrick was born in Leicester in 1862 and began showing signs of deformity at age two. He was eventually forced to live with his father, who did not want the child, and sent him out onto the streets to earn money.Because no one would hire him, he decided to star in a carnival attraction as The Elephant Man. When sideshows were outlawed in the UK in 1886 he traveled to Belgium to find work and was mistreated by a showman.In due time gained a friendship with Dr. Frederick Treves (played by Anthony Hopkins in the film), a physician at London Hospital. He was finally given proper care and actually ended up drawing the attention of many rich Victorians of the time, including the Queen herself.Joseph died in his sleep in 1890. Because of the size of his head he could not sleep horizontally, but the film proposes he tried to just once in order to imitate normal sleeping patterns of other humans. Others claim he was trying to commit suicide, which I somewhat doubt.In July 2003, a doctor named Charis Eng took samples of Merrick's hair and bone and determined that he had suffered from Proteus syndrome, and not neurofibromatosis, as initially suspected.Of interesting note, although Merrick's skeletal remains are now on display at London Hospital, Michael Jackson reportedly tried to purchase Joseph's remains in 1985 to add to his private collection. The less said about this, the better.David Lynch seems an odd choice to direct this tale for obvious reasons - he is typically associated with the more bizarre, but The Elephant Man is actually quite Lynchian. Its cold, macabre layering provides a nice texture to the film. It's not unabashedly sentimental. It doesn't pull any cheap tricks. Lynch, as usual, keeps a certain distance from the viewer...and for once it pays off in a drama and makes The Elephant Man seem like a sort of macabre tale - which works to the film's advantage because it IS a rather macabre and depressing (if bittersweet) tale.This is my favorite Lynch film that I have seen so far and it's a pity that it isn't more highly regarded by those in the film industry. Although it made a bit of a fuss when it came out in 1980, it seems by today's standards it has drifted into semi-obscurity and its influence speaks more than the film itself.However, I think this should be required viewing for any film lovers. Technically it's beautiful - the black and white compliments the eerie undercurrents and the direction and performances (particularly Hurt and Hopkins) are very good.On another level (as an emotional experience) it doesn't resort to the type of controlling sentimentality that, say, a film such as Forrest Gump might.

Remember The Titans provides a step-by-step lesson in how not to use it.The film is based on the true story of the Titans, a high school football team from the small town of Alexandria, Virginia. It is 1971, their school has just been integrated, and their beloved head coach (Patton) has been replaced with a fiery African-American named Herman Boone (Washington). The players encounter a flurry of racial problems, and Boone hauls them all away to training camp to make them become not just a perfect football team, but friends as well. The film then chronicles the Titans' perfect season as they struggle to cope with a hateful, bigoted nation.From the first to the last frame of Titans, the audience is bombarded with an insurmountable amount of genre clichés and cringe-inducing cheese. To give you an idea of said cheese, let me just say that I cannot count on my fingers the number of times one or more characters randomly burst into song for no reason, usually singing what is sort of the film's theme song, Ain't No Mountain High Enough by Diana Ross. This is meant to be heart-warming, playful, and inspiring, but it just comes off as irritating. As far as clichés...lord, where do I start? We have copious amounts of soulful black characters who want to do nothing but love their brothers, the tough controversial coach who just wants to unite the team (and his underdeveloped assistant who just acts as someone to feed him back lines so he can essentially have conversations with himself), the promising athlete who is injured just before the big game, the ostentatious ladies' man with a big ego, the sensitive, enlightened hippie with long blonde locks (who is, of course, considered homosexual), the up-tight redneck who always hates c--ns no matter what, the lovable Bubba, the cute I'm nine and a half! tomboy girl who loves football, not Barbies (complete with a foil little girl to emphasize how much she loves football and hates Barbies!), and two, count 'em, two token fat guys whose purpose is to simply provide contrived comic relief, usually in the form of singing the aforementioned Ain't No Mountain High Enough.On top of the script being shallow, predictable, conventional, and all too sentimental, I think one of the things that bothered me the most about Titans was Trevor Rabin's intrusive, grating score. It was nothing but a ubiquitous, inescapable cliché trying to tell the audience what to think. It was, to put it bluntly, insulting.The acting is capably handled by Denzel Washington and Will Patton (who are both very talented actors who consistently accept awful roles), but everyone else in this turgid mess stumbles through their bland scenes and poorly-written lines with about as much intensity as a dead turtle. The direction, delivered by Boaz Yakin (whose illustrious directing career is comprised of three other films including the fabulous Uptown Girls! He also wrote such fantastic films as From Dusk Till Dawn 2 Texas Blood Money, Dirty Dancing Havana Nights, and, surprise, surprise, The Rookie, another touching Disney sports extravaganza!), is utterly pedestrian. Also, the soundtrack is comprised of '60s and '70s rock songs that are all great, but have become nothing more than mood-setting clichés (someone's been watching too much Forrest Gump).Remember The Titans also suffers from the severe detriment of taking itself too seriously. It is trying so self-consciously hard to deliver a message that it ends up doing nothing but degrading the audience's intelligence with its obvious agenda. It tries to force us to laugh, cry, and be inspired, but it only succeeds in annoying us.The only thing that saves this film from falling into the D range are its occasional entertaining moments, but they are far too little to save this twisted wreck of overused morals and tired storytelling vehicles. Denzel, please try to stay away from horrid wastes of celluloid such as this and try to star in more films like Training Day. You can do better.4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"29 September 2005","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" It is common knowledge in the film critic community that sentimentality, if used improperly, is among the most hated of all celluloid evils.

We have copious amounts of soulful black characters who want to do nothing but love their brothers, the tough controversial coach who just wants to unite the team (and his underdeveloped assistant who just acts as someone to feed him back lines so he can essentially have conversations with himself), the promising athlete who is injured just before the big game, the ostentatious ladies' man with a big ego, the sensitive, enlightened hippie with long blonde locks (who is, of course, considered homosexual), the up-tight redneck who always hates c--ns no matter what, the lovable Bubba, the cute I'm nine and a half! tomboy girl who loves football, not Barbies (complete with a foil little girl to emphasize how much she loves football and hates Barbies!), and two, count 'em, two token fat guys whose purpose is to simply provide contrived comic relief, usually in the form of singing the aforementioned Ain't No Mountain High Enough.On top of the script being shallow, predictable, conventional, and all too sentimental, I think one of the things that bothered me the most about Titans was Trevor Rabin's intrusive, grating score. It was nothing but a ubiquitous, inescapable cliché trying to tell the audience what to think. It was, to put it bluntly, insulting.The acting is capably handled by Denzel Washington and Will Patton (who are both very talented actors who consistently accept awful roles), but everyone else in this turgid mess stumbles through their bland scenes and poorly-written lines with about as much intensity as a dead turtle. The direction, delivered by Boaz Yakin (whose illustrious directing career is comprised of three other films including the fabulous Uptown Girls! He also wrote such fantastic films as From Dusk Till Dawn 2 Texas Blood Money, Dirty Dancing Havana Nights, and, surprise, surprise, The Rookie, another touching Disney sports extravaganza!), is utterly pedestrian. Also, the soundtrack is comprised of '60s and '70s rock songs that are all great, but have become nothing more than mood-setting clichés (someone's been watching too much Forrest Gump).Remember The Titans also suffers from the severe detriment of taking itself too seriously. It is trying so self-consciously hard to deliver a message that it ends up doing nothing but degrading the audience's intelligence with its obvious agenda. It tries to force us to laugh, cry, and be inspired, but it only succeeds in annoying us.The only thing that saves this film from falling into the D range are its occasional entertaining moments, but they are far too little to save this twisted wreck of overused morals and tired storytelling vehicles.

Remember The Titans provides a step-by-step lesson in how not to use it.The film is based on the true story of the Titans, a high school football team from the small town of Alexandria, Virginia. It is 1971, their school has just been integrated, and their beloved head coach (Patton) has been replaced with a fiery African-American named Herman Boone (Washington). The players encounter a flurry of racial problems, and Boone hauls them all away to training camp to make them become not just a perfect football team, but friends as well. The film then chronicles the Titans' perfect season as they struggle to cope with a hateful, bigoted nation.From the first to the last frame of Titans, the audience is bombarded with an insurmountable amount of genre clichés and cringe-inducing cheese. To give you an idea of said cheese, let me just say that I cannot count on my fingers the number of times one or more characters randomly burst into song for no reason, usually singing what is sort of the film's theme song, Ain't No Mountain High Enough by Diana Ross.

It was advertised as a Rambo-style action flick here in the states. Back then, as a junior high kid, I was really pumped to see it. The film ended up being an interesting, but largely unfocused story of three young American men who take an unwarranted trip into the Soviet Union and pay a big price for it.The three protagonists are two Alpha-males and a nerd. One of the Alpha-males was played by Chuck Norris' son, if I recall. These three are driving around Finland above the arctic circle shooting guns, guzzling beers, and taking pictures. After stumbling around in the woods for a while, they come across the border to the USSR. And like idiots, they decide to sneak over to the other side for fun. This is all within the first 10 minutes. After that, one bad thing after another happens to them, leaving the viewer little choice but to feel that these jokers had it coming.First off, they are blamed for the killing of a local village girl. When we find out who really did the killing, that is one of the more intriguing points of the film. I wish the film could have just stayed in the village and explored this plot rather than jumping the tracks and moving on to more ridiculous elements later on. Anyway, the three are set to be executed, and somehow elude their captors in an incredibly violent shootout. Now on the run, with one of their party wounded, the three are easy prey for Soviet troops as they try to make their way back to Finland.Of course, the boys are captured in one of those typical border scenes where all the spotlights are instantly turned on, revealing the helpless victims who are now at the mercy of the evil commies. After being brutally interrogated, the three are dumped into a gulag somewhere in Siberia to be forgotten. The place is no Kolyma, but it certainly would suck to be in there. Not only are the conditions rough for regular prisoners, but beneath the prison is a game of human chess! Real people are used for pieces, and the losers are apparently killed! Yes! I have never seen anything like that in a movie before. Too bad they don't spend enough time dealing with this game, or the people who play it.Finally, with the help of a mysterious prisoner the lone remaining American is able to fight his way out of the prison and escape with a young woman he has fallen in love with along the way. All this in just over 90 min!!! This film was directed by a now-famous Renny Harlin. He demonstrates some genuine skill with the limited budget this film obviously had. The problems are more at the screenplay level. Too many questions are not answered, and too many paths not properly explored. Just who in the hell was The Admiral? He was no David Robinson; that's for sure. What was he doing in the prison? What were his plans once he got out? And how in the heck was the last American going to get out of the USSR?? After all the damage he did??? Come on! The film could have been much better, but it still manages to hold some interest. Good luck finding this one on TV, but a spare copy of it is no doubt floating around on Amazon or somewhere like that.5 of 10 stars. The Hound has spoken.

He was no David Robinson; that's for sure. What was he doing in the prison? What were his plans once he got out? And how in the heck was the last American going to get out of the USSR?? After all the damage he did??? Come on! The film could have been much better, but it still manages to hold some interest. Good luck finding this one on TV, but a spare copy of it is no doubt floating around on Amazon or somewhere like that.5 of 10 stars. The Hound has spoken.

It was advertised as a Rambo-style action flick here in the states. Back then, as a junior high kid, I was really pumped to see it. The film ended up being an interesting, but largely unfocused story of three young American men who take an unwarranted trip into the Soviet Union and pay a big price for it.The three protagonists are two Alpha-males and a nerd. One of the Alpha-males was played by Chuck Norris' son, if I recall. These three are driving around Finland above the arctic circle shooting guns, guzzling beers, and taking pictures. After stumbling around in the woods for a while, they come across the border to the USSR. And like idiots, they decide to sneak over to the other side for fun. This is all within the first 10 minutes. After that, one bad thing after another happens to them, leaving the viewer little choice but to feel that these jokers had it coming.First off, they are blamed for the killing of a local village girl. When we find out who really did the killing, that is one of the more intriguing points of the film. I wish the film could have just stayed in the village and explored this plot rather than jumping the tracks and moving on to more ridiculous elements later on. Anyway, the three are set to be executed, and somehow elude their captors in an incredibly violent shootout. Now on the run, with one of their party wounded, the three are easy prey for Soviet troops as they try to make their way back to Finland.Of course, the boys are captured in one of those typical border scenes where all the spotlights are instantly turned on, revealing the helpless victims who are now at the mercy of the evil commies. After being brutally interrogated, the three are dumped into a gulag somewhere in Siberia to be forgotten. The place is no Kolyma, but it certainly would suck to be in there. Not only are the conditions rough for regular prisoners, but beneath the prison is a game of human chess! Real people are used for pieces, and the losers are apparently killed! Yes! I have never seen anything like that in a movie before. Too bad they don't spend enough time dealing with this game, or the people who play it.Finally, with the help of a mysterious prisoner the lone remaining American is able to fight his way out of the prison and escape with a young woman he has fallen in love with along the way. All this in just over 90 min!!! This film was directed by a now-famous Renny Harlin. He demonstrates some genuine skill with the limited budget this film obviously had. The problems are more at the screenplay level. Too many questions are not answered, and too many paths not properly explored. Just who in the hell was The Admiral?

It seems he enjoys expanding his slapstick to its fullest extent, but suddenly - right when we're getting comfortable - he realizes he has to end the picture and resolve the conflicts of his characters, so he diverts the course and natural progression his movie and it transforms into an introspective psychology session.Point in fact Ferris Bueller's Day Off. The first half is excellent. Our heroes our introduced, comedy ensues and we have a great deal of fun watching the narrative unfold.The second half - or more appropriately, last third - of the film is not excellent. Suddenly Hughes realizes Bueller's foil, Cameron (Alan Ruck), must confront his father. That Bueller's sister Jeannie (Jennifer Grey) must come to terms with her resentment towards her brother. That Ferris must contemplate the meaning of life, marriage and love between himself and his wife-to-be (Mia Sara).It's this type of stuff I can't get into. Look, I really love some of the stuff Hughes has done. He's a very good filmmaker. But he's always had a problem with endings and pretensions... the turning point for me in Ferris Bueller is when Cameron stares into the oil painting at the museum in Chicago...from here onwards Cameron goes into this weird state of comatose (particularly towards the end), Ferris starts talking to us about moving on to college, how Cameron's dad is a jerk, etc.Of course this is a natural conclusion for any film or literary writing - conflict --> desire --> outcome. But Hughes' problem is that his change in progression is too swift - the movie goes from being a light-hearted comedy to this pretentious study of teenage angst in which it takes our selfish Cameron hours to realize he must step up to his father...and for what reason? At what cost? What truly is the point? For Ferris, a great future awaits him. He will marry his high school sweetheart, go to college, continue milking friendships for what they're worth. His sister will get a new boyfriend and stop hating her brother.But poor Cameron...his revelation at the end of the movie is that he's going to step up to his father and almost certainly face a miserable life? Yes, it's nice on film to see Cameron rebel against his strict father...it's a teenage ideal...all fathers are evil. But come on already - wrecking a Ferrari and having your character's inspiration be taking the blame for it is a lame ending. I've never liked it.I understand many people do. Somehow, I can see why. As I'm writing this, I have to admit, it doesn't sound quite as pretentious as it comes across as being in the film. One could say the same thing about any teen movie - particularly Risky Business. But there's just something about this one. It suffers from that flaw Hughes has had his entire career. He just doesn't really know how to end his film (he's admitted this before... he said in an interview he never likes to end a movie, and that's why his closings always extend with extra footage while the credits scroll down).Sometimes he's gotten away with it - The Breakfast Club for example. That movie ended with a sudden introspective moment where the kids all got together and examined each other's problems. But it made more sense, given the context. It was justifiable. The ending of Bueller is not. I think it's childish and myopic.I do realize I've just repeated myself for about ten straight paragraphs, but that's something that's always bothered me about this film and I had to get it off my chest.What I DO like about it (1) Matthew Broderick is hilarious and perfect for the role (2) The first hour or so is very funny and straightforward comedy (3) The characters are likable and seem realistic (4) Jeffrey Jones' quest to find Ferris is a very strong subplot...and so on.It's just a shame, you know, about that ending...
