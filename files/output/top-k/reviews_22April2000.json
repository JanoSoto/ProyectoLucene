Wife has an intriguing,original idea which propelled me to watch it.Unfortunately,maybe because of a fault on the scriptwriters part,it is executed in a slumberous,uninvolving fashion.It was clever and well thought of to have Depp and his co star's charecter get lost in outer space for 2 minutes,and to never really even begin to know until the end what happened in those crucial moments,but while this propelled the film,the human drama back on earth derailed it.The cliched,dozily handled expressions of terror and concern on people's faces descended into farce.The part played by the guy who played Miles Dyson in Terminator 2 was the most hammily over the top piece of acting I've seen since Kenneth Branagh transformed himself into Victor Frankenstein.While not playing his part poorly,the script seemed to leave a lot out for Depp to do.I never understood why his wife ,played by the catchingly attractive Charlize Theron,was getting so spooked about in the first place,all he really did was creep up on her on times when she was trying to satisfy her own paranoia.It also made little sense to me why impregnating just one person with the alien spawn would work when it would,on that basis,take centuries for the aliens to conquer earth if that was their mission,during which time it might have destroyed.While this movie boasts some stunning fast camera visuals (one in outer space,the other on an underground train),it is further marred by the most blurry,video soundtrack in ages.** ","genre":null},{"date":"22 April 2000","score":"","review":"  STAR

Many people who've seen U-571 have also seen Das Boot. Many of these people are also complaining that U-571 was predictable. So I pose this question Was Das Boot predictable? Any viewer would expect the noble crew to return home to Germany safely and without loss of their ship. Right? But it didn't happen that way, did it? In comparing these two films, is it fair to argue that U-571 was really predictable during the initial viewing? I, for one, (also comparing it to Das Boot) was more or less awaiting the inevitable failure of the crew as much as their success. How can anyone really predict a movie outright?
