I didn't think it was better than the first American Pie, but then again I didn't think it was worse. American Pie 2 is *definitely* ruder than the first one though. It's good to see it's still doing well though, as all the 'gross out' comedies coming out at the moment are flopping. I guess, everyone wanted to see the gang back here again. This time the gang are all in college and a year later the guys reunite for yet another summer of fun. Everyone from the first American Pie are back here. Even the ones who had minor roles in the first movie.American Pie 2 centers around Jim and him trying to be better at the sex, as Nadia the foreign exchange student from the first American Pie is coming to visit him. He gets a little help from band geek and old prom date, Michelle. Then you have Kevin and Vicky, who after breaking up a year ago are faced in an awkward situation after seeing each-other again and just being 'friends'. Oz has to deal with being away, from girlfriend Heather, who's studying abroad in France. Of course Stifler is here being his usual stupid self and who dislikes Finch (Who's practising Japanese art now.) even more after Finch slept with his mother Janine. And, of course there's the brilliant Natasha Lyonne here, who has another cool role in the movie too. The guys are in movie most of the time, with most of the girls only getting small roles. Jim probably has the best bits here and Jim's dad too, who is really funny as always.Well, we all know the cast here, with the likes of Jason Biggs, Natasha Lyonne, Mena Suvari and Eugene Levy who are all great.Anyway, if you enjoyed the first American Pie, than you're bound to like this sequel.

The first film of his I saw was VIDEODROME.  Cronenberg's real talent, which has always been the mark of excellent creators of science fiction, is the ability to mix contemporary experience with original fiction.  In Videodrome, an example of this are the pirate television broadcasts of sexual torture.  He mixed the idea of, say, a pirate radio broadcast, with a broadcast product which had I daresay heretofore never been thought of.  I will probably never again watch 1986's THE FLY, which I saw in a theater. But that doesn't mean I didn't like it at the time.  At the time, and to this day, I think it's the best filmed realization of the theme, and to date 5 movies have been filmed with this theme, where teleportation mixes man and fly.  Unfortunately I have mellowed with age and no longer crave violent cinema.  Very early in The Fly, I knew I would love it, when Cronenberg provides the reason behind the invention of teleportation.  The reason is the inventor, the scientist Brundle, suffers a chronic motion sickness which makes any other form of travel, even riding in a car, excruciatingly painful.  I loved the love story.  Who couldn't fall in love with Geena Davis?  I was horrified as Brundle's slow transformation gradually tore his romance apart.  The gross-out scenes are highly realistic (another Cronenberg trademark) and also truly horrifying.  The fact that it takes so long for Brundle to realize his lot is tragic and truly horrific.  The third character (John Getz, the guy who play's Geena's confidant) has a truly horrible character, way beyond hateful, you just want to kick him in the teeth, and eventually The Fly does just that.  I consider this Jeff Goldblum's breakthrough film, this is the movie that made him a star, and you get the quintessential Goldblum here, which sometimes seems only reiterated in all his later films.  You get the wit, the sexual repartee, his acting with his hands and fingers and his eyes and all the muscles in his face, god he's like an acrobat with his face, and his slow burns slower than any other actor except perhaps Charles Grodin.  So you may decide never again to see The Fly, like I did, but you should see it once, like I did, and you WILL be impressed, like I am.

I was impressed because of Satine (Nicole Kidman). She is so beautiful. Nicole Kidman is always great. Her performances are amazing, except for (Practical magic). I'll never forget her performance in my favorite movie The portrait of a lady by Jane Campion. She was excellent. It was definitely her best performance. She should have won an academy award for best actress in the portrait of a lady. Anyway it doesn't matter now. I hope she will win an academy award for best actress in a leading role this year since she hasn't ever been nominated for one. Hopefully she will be the Oscar winner this time for Moulin Rouge. The story is stunning as well as the performances and the music played. it was kind of modern. The scenery is very flashy as well. The windmill was an excellent instrument for making this film. This makes it different and interesting. Ewan Macgregor was OK. But I really didn't like that much his performance as a poet. In fact I really didn't like one part of this movie. It's that the movie shows the ending at the beginning. I was so disappointed. The ending was obvious in it because Christian (Ewan Macgregor) begins telling the story of Satine a smoldering temptress who is in love with him, but she finally dies because of a disease. It didn't make sense. Christian told us the story, but he first told us about Satine death. I mean it'd have been much better if he wouldn't have told us anything at the beginning. The movie lost interest after finding out that she was going to die. It was the worst thing about this movie. Anyway even though it failed on it. I think it was the best story about love ever told.

Even allowing for that, this movie is somewhat of a dissapointment. This movie proves that it wasn't just special FX that made Star Wars fun to watch. It was as if George Lucas was so thrilled with what he could do with CGI effects, he forgot what made the original trilogy so great, which is writing and characters. It's not a bad film but the problems are many.-Many people have forgiven this movie for being lackluster as they say It is only the first in another trilogy and it is just setting up everything to follow. WRONG WRONG WRONG, this film needed to be it's own movie first and foremost as the other three films were. It needed to have good characters and a somewhat interesting story....it didn't.-The conflict in this story revolves around a trade dispute and the fate of the planet Naboo. Was anybody really caring about this? The details of the dispute are somewhat vague and what is revealed doesn't real generate enough interest for us to root for a particular side. The important conflict regarding Darth Sideous and his rise is kept far far in the background. We don't even know why Darth Maul hates the Jedi's so much....he just does. Possibly Lucas wanted Darth Maul to be somewhat like Boba Fett (silent and mysterious). It worked with Boba Fett because he was only a supporting character, not a main villian. This film really has no clear villian. I wish somebody would have had the courage and just told Lucas that his basic story was lousy.-Nobody looks particularly happy in this film. Qui-gon is really the only character that can be related to and even he is rather distant. The queen acts like a mannequin in much of her scenes (and looks like one to). Obi-wan Kenobi wanders through the entire movie to no avail and never says anything interesting. The characters never seem to talk about anything besides the plot (unlike in the first film).  C3PO and R2-D2 were pretty pointless. The Jedi council comes across as extremely cold and buracratic. And I will never understand WHY they wrote Annakin as a grade school kid in this film. He should have been a teenager. His scenes with the queen were awkward. We're not even going to discuss Jar Jar.Various other things...-The midochlorians thing seems to have just been tacked on. The humor falls flat unless you are an extremely small child. Annakin destroys the trade ship at the end and safves everyone, basically BY MISTAKE!!! ILM and George Lucas seem to be so happy with their new CGI toys that they spent 95% of their time perfecting them. Quite frankly I thought the FX in Return of the Jedi were sharper, more dimensional and less cartoonish. Nothing all that memorable seems to happen here.

I have never really liked any of Kubrick's work, but this one is unique in its bad performance.I began watching this movie with an open mind and hoped for a pretty good movie. I simply love Spielbergs other movies, and thought that this should be at least equally good as his other films. I was very wrong.The beginning is good. I felt that David, the robot-with-feelings, was a good character and Haley Joel Osment, playing him, does a remarkable job.

The trailer more or less gives you a complete description of what happens in the film, but that means absolutely nothing. When the film started, I was thinking to myself, This is so programmed, and I know what is going to happen next here, but that did not last very long at all. Yes, at first the film seems to take this very artificially programmed horror genre and do what it has done before, but then it does what you would have never expected it to do, take a completely different path than you could have ever imagined. The imagery, editing, score, and lighting techniques, not to mention the fact that we never really see what the killer looks like is utterly terrifying. At the end of any of the 3 scream films (if you were scared at all), when the audience finds out who the killer is, it is not as scary anymore. In our society we always want to know the how and why of everything. I guess you could take that and apply it to various individuals who are afraid of dying and turn to god. Regardless, not knowing has always been nerve racking. My best example; Jaws. If we could see the shark for the fake mechanical malfunctioning Bruce, which it was, who cares?When you watch a scene and say I know what is going to happen next, he is going to come barreling out of the cornfield just like did earlier in the film a few times, and then something completely different happens is scary because you are not prepared for it. It is unpredictable. Isn't that what makes scary movies scary? Not knowing who it is or where they may be certainly is to me. After all, if we saw everything from rusty nail's point of view, who would be scared? At one point, the two brothers try to figure how far their CB radio's signal range may reach to another CB, indicating it may be just 5 miles or so. Is it? who knows. This is indication of a feeling that the psychopathic deviate may be a lot closer than you think, even if you are on a great big stretch of highway.I live in a small college town and there is nothing to do here except either drink or watch movies. I watch movies. I have seen classics, horror, drama, foreign, and everything else in between. In conclusion, the plausibility and realistic point of view when you watch ANY film is always in question to a certain degree. If it wasn't, who would watch it? Would have U-571, Erin Brockovich or Patch Adams have made any money if they were even close to reality? Probably not. U-571 was not as action packed as in real life, that water has never been proven to cause cancer and Brockovich has numerous lawsuits pending against her as well as practicing law without a license, and many people have died under Patch Adam's care trying to use his methods. Maybe most people in a panic would go seek the police in a situation such as these kids, but how would any of us know until it happens?The reality of a movie such as this or many others does not matter. If anyone looks too deep into a plot of any movie, sure, they are going to hate a film. Just as people try to compare a book to a movie. They are two different mediums so don't even try.This movie is supposed to be entertainment, not an analysis of what we would do if it were us. It is easy to say, Oh, I wouldn't ever be that dumb as to not do this or that, but seeing as most people don't recognize their own actions no one has any room to say what character of a film should or should not do. Everyone in this world is different and we all handle our lives and problems differently. Being critical towards an artistic and truly entertaining piece of work and ruining it for others just because you don't agree with the character's personality, motives, and coping strategies in a movie is not the way to go.

It isn't a Kubrick film nor is it Star Wars, but it never intended to be.  Meatballs III is, very simply, a summer camp B-movie infused with a dose of teenage humor.  I enjoy it and even own it on videotape because the film's premise is hilarious and it plays out well.  (I didn't pay much for the used tape, though.)

As a writer, I was blown away the first time I saw this movie because the script is so excellent every character in the film, from the lead priest to the maid, seems to have something at stake in the plot, be it religious morals, sexual happiness, love, personal fulfillment, honesty, duty or physical safety. The characters grow out of the situation in a way that's surprisingly organic in today's movie scene, where often the plot seems to be incidental to the characters, or vice versa. Regardless of your take on the issues, I think you have to admire that they are being presented, not just talked about, and the film does an excellent job of balancing both the potential enormousness of the questions it raises, and the intimate, personal nature of its story. After the script, another reason to love PRIEST is the performances it is one of those few movies where absolutely everyone is excellent, from Roache and Wilkinson, down to bit players like the irate Housekeeper at the priest retreat and the young reporter who tries to corner Roache after his hearing. The film is shot very well, especially considering they could have gotten away with a fairly straightforward point and shoot but no, we got so amazingly well framed shots of the North Sea, England in winter, industrial vistas... And yes, whether you agree with its stance or not, kudos to the movie for taking a plethora of tough subjects like homosexuality, religious guilt, incest and life on earth vs. life in heaven, and dealing with them in a mature and often compassionate manner (as opposed to say, the way Kevin Smith deals with them in DOGMA). All in all, an excellent film. Watch it with an open mind, and a keen artistic eye.
