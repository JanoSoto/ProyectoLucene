The previews looked great, and I like Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy, but the initial few moments of Smashmouth's All-Star made me first think of Mystery Men, and then Why is a Top 40 hit in an animated film set in a fairy tale past?  Admittedly, all the music specifically designed for the film's (naturally) smash soundtrack did turn me off a little, and it lost a point for that, as I would have given it a nine easily.  But the rest of the musical score was fine.  Note to filmmakers  Bad.  Bad.  Don't use hip marketing ploys in good movies as it only hinders, not helps.As for the rest of the film, I did enjoy it.  Quite a bit, actually.  The CG was simply amazing.  There were several times when the line between reality and animation was effectively blurred, so technically, it was impressive.  I also had a good time with the story.  Shrek took a few solid jabs at Disney, such as Lord Farquaad's blatantly theme-park inspired castle to some character designs, to even the goofy song at an inappropriate moment (of which this film pokes even harder fun at).  It also has a few nods to Matrix and Babe.The film is very, very funny at times.  Mostly in part to the voices, but some characters, such as the Gingerbread Man and Robin Hood made for great scenes.  The dragon was also a really impressive visual treat.From extremely detailed character expressions, to genuine laughs, to a few surprisingly sweet-natured moments, this film offered quite a bit, and even threw in a little adult humor and profanity at times.  But it's light stuff, so it's not too bad.  I guess besides the Top 40 music, the only other two things I didn't like about the film (but so many other films do it, that I can't singularly criticize this film) is all the fart humor.

What is the point is that, whichever way you slice it, this film is extremely poor.Much has already been said about the extreme ropiness of the accents all round.  We have Nicolas Cage sounding like he's wandered in from a Cornetto advert, a Spanish Greek, a scouse German (to quote Empire magazine), and a passable Greek accent from John Hurt.  But what is most amusing is that there are supposed to be four different languages knocking about the film (Greek, Italian, German, English), but, due to Hollywood's fear of subtitles, there is in fact only one.  Consequently, in one scene, a Greek listens to a BBC news report (in English, and supposed to be), then says (in English, but ostensibly Greek) that he does not understand it.This aside though, the central romance, between Captain Corelli and Pelagia, is really where the film either stands or falls; and sadly, it does the latter.  The two characters share what seems like virtually no screen time, and certainly no chemistry.  I must mention the book here, because in it, there is a true sense of the relationship between the captain and Pelagia.

It's full of dirty jokes and childish humor, but underneath all of the goofball comedy, it actually comes through with a very healthy message, which is virtually non-existent in these dumb comedies. Deuce Bigalow is a lowly fish tank cleaner, and when one of his important clients has to leave town on business, he hires Deuce to look after his place and especially one of his precious fish, which would not survive on it's own the entire time that Anton (the client) is out of town. Needless to say, Deuce starts screwing around in the lavish apartment and breaks Anton's ridiculously expensive fish tank and then has to come up with $6,000 to replace it and do other repairs around the house. This is when Deuce has the brilliant idea to assume Anton's job as a gigolo, because he knows he'll never make the money on time cleaning fish tanks. Unfortunately, he gets all of the freaky clients, like the gigantic black woman (`Did you say steak?') and the eight foot tall girl (`That's a huge bitch!'), the girl with narcolepsy that falls asleep at the weirdest times, and of course, they could never leave out a date with Tourette's syndrome, definitely the least amusing of all of them. So Deuce goes through all of these awful dates, and then he meets a girl on another date that is perfect except she has a prosthetic leg. This is where the healthy message comes in, because Deuce learns that he really loves this girl, and it really doesn't matter to him that she only has one leg. He falls in love with her pretty quick, but the romance of it all, as cheesy as it was, is actually pretty well done. Deuce is trying to get enough money to replace the stuff in Anton's apartment, so he goes on one last date with one of Anton's stunningly beautiful clients, and he even rejects her aggressive sexual advances because he's in love. Sure, he does a pretty graphic strip-tease for her, but you get the point of his intentions.However, despite the fact that the movie is full of goofy jokes, some of the comedy was pretty good. Deuce's toilet-cleaning father was pretty amusing at some points, and most of all, the detective that was after Deuce and especially Anton (his wife was one of Anton's clients) was hilarious in every scene he was in. `I got a thin dick!'

It was just great how he was at first really threatening to Deuce, and then he would suddenly ask his advice about whether Deuce thought he could make some money in the gigolo business or what he thought that red spot on his penis was (`It wasn't there this morning, I checked!').As a whole, this is another one of those brainless comedies aimed at immature or uneducated (or both) audiences, but it doesn't fail on just about all levels like most of these types of movies always seem to do.

The biggest flaw is the pace, since the scenes on land drag on over and over.  These moments hurt an otherwise entertaining and often fun motion picture.The plot is mostly a re-hash of Jaws.  It even takes place in the same town, Amity.  It's been years since the first shark was killed and Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) begins to have his suspicions of another great white in the vicinity when two divers are reported missing, a boating accident that results in the mysterious disappearance of a mother and daughter, and a killer whale washed ashore with large bites all over it.  Brody voices his beliefs to the mayor (Murray Hamilton), who, along with real estate developer Glenn Petersen (Joseph Mascolo), disregard this because of the current production of a hotel on the beach.  Brody's constant paranoia of the situation eventually gets him fired.  Meanwhile, his two sons, Mike and Sean, sneak off to sail with a group of other teens.  When another shark attack occurs and is confirmed, Brody sets off to find his sons before it's too late. I've heard a lot of interesting things involving the making of this sequel.  Apparently, Spielberg and Dreyfuss were interested in returning, but couldn't due to their filming of Close Encounters.  The original story was supposed to be more character-oriented, without as much focus on the teens in peril, but when Spielberg had to back out the studio executives got nervous and went with Szwarc to make a more formulaic and effective sequel.  Roy Scheider would be the only big star from the original who would return.I'm a huge admirer of Steven Spielberg's film, and it would be hard for any other director to equal, much less surpass, his filmmaking techniques.  Director Jeannot Szwarc does an overall solid job here.  He knows what made the first film effective and holds off long camera shots of the shark for a while (in my opinion, maybe a little too long).  The beginning of the film does a nice job of creating interest and a good set-up is appreciated.  However, this set-up goes on a little too long.  A half-hour would have been just fine, but Szwarc takes nearly 75 minutes for the film to focus on the shark hunting down the sailing teens.  You may wonder why I voice my complaint for this when in the original the shark didn't make it's first full appearance until near the end.  Well, in that film's case there were three great characters (only one of whom returned) and some classic suspense sequences to crank up the tension (Dreyfuss and Scheider's exploration of the abandoned boat, anyone?).  While Szwarc should be noted for trying to build up momentum, he slows down everything a little too much and thrill seekers looking for non-stop action may find it disappointing, and it might be more up their alley to look for Deep Blue Sea (which is considerably faster moving, though is an overall weaker film).It is initially interesting to see how this sequel builds up its story with such scenes as the examination of a dead killer whale and a diver who runs into the shark, and it is quite entertaining to revisit Amity again, but Brody's constant back and forth debates with the town committee get tiresome after awhile.  We know he's right and they're wrong and the film makers should have realized that these arguments get old quickly.  To be fair, Scheider's performance does put in a bit more tension into these scenes, but it takes something more clever than that to keep things moving at a brisk pace.The film does finally get moving in the last 35 or so minutes, and it's in those moments that make the film the overall effective sequel it is.  The constant shark attacks deliver the goods.  Szwarc knows how to milk tension into these scenes and doesn't disappoint.  The finale is particularly an exercise in creating seat-gripping suspense.  It's almost a match for the conclusion to Jaws.  The final showdown between Brody and the shark is just as memorable and edge-of-the-seat as his final confrontation with the other great white in the original.  John Williams' score is as effective as ever and serves to heighten the tension factor by a notch.Admittedly, there are some implausibilities abound.  Great whites aren't nearly that aggressive and for one that eats as much as it does, it's really quite hungry.  The shark even pulls down a helicopter in one scene to presumably eat the pilot (In the TV version, there's an added scene of the shark trying to chomp the pilot).  Brody's plan to kill the shark relies on quite a bit of luck, though I won't complain as much about this since it is the film's highlight sequence and is an example of masterful direction.Most people tend to ridicule the visual effects in the Jaws series.  In my opinion, they're more effective and significantly better than CGI renditions of animals seen in the more recent thrillers like Deep Blue Sea, Anaconda, and Lake Placid.  Szwarc's high angle shots of the great white are the best, evoking a sense of terror by just looking at the top of this ferocious animal.  With an animatronic shark, it's not nearly as mobile as what can be rendered by computer technology, but it beats having the animal look like a refugee from a video game.  There are also other things that set this film above those aforementioned movies, such as restraint, seriousness, and no annoying over-reliance on mostly unfunny self-deprecating humor.To mention how effective the script is would probably be a moot point.  Anybody watching this movie wants to see it for the shark attacks.  Howard Sackler and Carl Gottlieb do a reasonable job of repeating what was successful in the original story without completely ripping it off.  This time around, there's no compelling monologue like Robert Shaw's retelling of the fate of the men on the U.S.S. Indianapolis, but the screenwriters can be credited for not writing any laughably ludicrous dialogue.  When the stranded teens argue, everything they say is reasonable within the context of the situation they're in.The film's performances are overall decent.  Roy Scheider has always been one of my favorite actors; he's easily the best here and is very good as the man determined to save his sons.  Martin Brody is still by all means a great character, and Scheider's portrayal of him as an everyman caught up in a terrifying situation makes it extremely easy to sympathize with him.  Lorraine Gray is decent as his wife and though she gets more screen time than before she's still not given a chance to fully flesh out her character. And, boy, we all saw her character develop in Jaws the Revenge, but we all know how that turned out. Murray Hamilton and Joseph Mascolo are appropriately sneaky and sly as the town mayor and real estate developer.  They're really not so much people as they are those who have to be wrong all the time.  It's a cliche, and it's not as effective as it was in Jaws. I can't really say which actor who portrays the teens does the best job.  They're all fairly equal and they are pretty good at not annoying us, which makes it easier to feel for them when the shark attacks begin.It's basically like this  when the film takes place on land, it's sometimes slow-moving and not always interesting.  When it's on water, it's often exciting and tense, with suspense that sometimes equals the original.  It's definitely not as great a thriller as Jaws, but it is a worthy sequel and certainly is better than the likes of Deep Blue Sea, Anaconda, and Lake Placid.

The biggest flaw is the pace, since the scenes on land drag on over and over.  These moments hurt an otherwise entertaining and often fun motion picture.The plot is mostly a re-hash of Jaws.  It even takes place in the same town, Amity.  It's been years since the first shark was killed and Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) begins to have his suspicions of another great white in the vicinity when two divers are reported missing, a boating accident that results in the mysterious disappearance of a mother and daughter, and a killer whale washed ashore with large bites all over it.  Brody voices his beliefs to the mayor (Murray Hamilton), who, along with real estate developer Glenn Petersen (Joseph Mascolo), disregard this because of the current production of a hotel on the beach.  Brody's constant paranoia of the situation eventually gets him fired.  Meanwhile, his two sons, Mike and Sean, sneak off to sail with a group of other teens.  When another shark attack occurs and is confirmed, Brody sets off to find his sons before it's too late. I've heard a lot of interesting things involving the making of this sequel.  Apparently, Spielberg and Dreyfuss were interested in returning, but couldn't due to their filming of Close Encounters.  The original story was supposed to be more character-oriented, without as much focus on the teens in peril, but when Spielberg had to back out the studio executives got nervous and went with Szwarc to make a more formulaic and effective sequel.  Roy Scheider would be the only big star from the original who would return.I'm a huge admirer of Steven Spielberg's film, and it would be hard for any other director to equal, much less surpass, his filmmaking techniques.  Director Jeannot Szwarc does an overall solid job here.  He knows what made the first film effective and holds off long camera shots of the shark for a while (in my opinion, maybe a little too long).  The beginning of the film does a nice job of creating interest and a good set-up is appreciated.  However, this set-up goes on a little too long.  A half-hour would have been just fine, but Szwarc takes nearly 75 minutes for the film to focus on the shark hunting down the sailing teens.  You may wonder why I voice my complaint for this when in the original the shark didn't make it's first full appearance until near the end.  Well, in that film's case there were three great characters (only one of whom returned) and some classic suspense sequences to crank up the tension (Dreyfuss and Scheider's exploration of the abandoned boat, anyone?).  While Szwarc should be noted for trying to build up momentum, he slows down everything a little too much and thrill seekers looking for non-stop action may find it disappointing, and it might be more up their alley to look for Deep Blue Sea (which is considerably faster moving, though is an overall weaker film).It is initially interesting to see how this sequel builds up its story with such scenes as the examination of a dead killer whale and a diver who runs into the shark, and it is quite entertaining to revisit Amity again, but Brody's constant back and forth debates with the town committee get tiresome after awhile.  We know he's right and they're wrong and the film makers should have realized that these arguments get old quickly.  To be fair, Scheider's performance does put in a bit more tension into these scenes, but it takes something more clever than that to keep things moving at a brisk pace.The film does finally get moving in the last 35 or so minutes, and it's in those moments that make the film the overall effective sequel it is.  The constant shark attacks deliver the goods.  Szwarc knows how to milk tension into these scenes and doesn't disappoint.  The finale is particularly an exercise in creating seat-gripping suspense.  It's almost a match for the conclusion to Jaws.  The final showdown between Brody and the shark is just as memorable and edge-of-the-seat as his final confrontation with the other great white in the original.  John Williams' score is as effective as ever and serves to heighten the tension factor by a notch.Admittedly, there are some implausibilities abound.  Great whites aren't nearly that aggressive and for one that eats as much as it does, it's really quite hungry.  The shark even pulls down a helicopter in one scene to presumably eat the pilot (In the TV version, there's an added scene of the shark trying to chomp the pilot).  Brody's plan to kill the shark relies on quite a bit of luck, though I won't complain as much about this since it is the film's highlight sequence and is an example of masterful direction.Most people tend to ridicule the visual effects in the Jaws series.  In my opinion, they're more effective and significantly better than CGI renditions of animals seen in the more recent thrillers like Deep Blue Sea, Anaconda, and Lake Placid.  Szwarc's high angle shots of the great white are the best, evoking a sense of terror by just looking at the top of this ferocious animal.  With an animatronic shark, it's not nearly as mobile as what can be rendered by computer technology, but it beats having the animal look like a refugee from a video game.  There are also other things that set this film above those aforementioned movies, such as restraint, seriousness, and no annoying over-reliance on mostly unfunny self-deprecating humor.To mention how effective the script is would probably be a moot point.  Anybody watching this movie wants to see it for the shark attacks.  Howard Sackler and Carl Gottlieb do a reasonable job of repeating what was successful in the original story without completely ripping it off.  This time around, there's no compelling monologue like Robert Shaw's retelling of the fate of the men on the U.S.S. Indianapolis, but the screenwriters can be credited for not writing any laughably ludicrous dialogue.

Jude Law really makes the movie great with his excellent portrayal (in tone, facial expressions, and other body languages) of the innocent shepherd boy thrust suddenly into manhood through brutal war, and later the uneasy hero of Russia's propaganda machine.We are told this is based on a true story. I am not a huge war buff so I don't know how accurate the events depicted are historically, but I was very impressed with the atmosphere created by director Annaud (Seven Years in Tibet) through the use of crumbled concrete landscapes, wonderful music, and earthy tone colors. This movie is full of stark and powerful images. Some of the highlights include the opening war sequence Only one rifle per 2 men and the Russian commander yelling When the man with the rifle dies, pick up the rifle and shoot! Young wide-eyed youths getting herded like cattle to the front lines to die, the Russians turning their guns on the deserters...All very powerful and interesting images! Ed Harris does a nice job as the stoic and seemingly invincible antagonist. I was hoping we would get a more over-the-top performance from Ed (similar to other great performances The Abyss & The Rock) but his quiet, silent, and deadly portrayal as the Nazi top sniper works just as well. I was happy to see Bob Hoskins and Ron Perlman give great supporting performances!Joesph Fiennes also put in another good performance as the political officer running the Russian political machine. Unfortunately, the love triangle felt a bit lackluster and tacked-on. Rachel Weisz's character felt like a silly cliche. The plot could have done without the love interest aspect. The main characters and action were interesting enough without it. The happy love ending really disappointed me as I felt it detracted from the strength of the film's otherwise strong messages\/images about war and death.FINAL RATING 8\/10 Despite suffering from the Hollywood mainstream must have love subplot and must have happy-ending syndromes that ruin many good plot ideas, this movie still is excellent with its believable and interesting plot, excellent production values, stark and powerful visuals, and generally excellent cast that give excellent performances. It was also refreshing to see a WW II movie that tackled the great war from a new aspect (i.e. sniper view). Fans of all types of movies should enjoy.

I am not a huge war buff so I don't know how accurate the events depicted are historically, but I was very impressed with the atmosphere created by director Annaud (Seven Years in Tibet) through the use of crumbled concrete landscapes, wonderful music, and earthy tone colors. This movie is full of stark and powerful images. Some of the highlights include the opening war sequence Only one rifle per 2 men and the Russian commander yelling When the man with the rifle dies, pick up the rifle and shoot! Young wide-eyed youths getting herded like cattle to the front lines to die, the Russians turning their guns on the deserters...All very powerful and interesting images! Ed Harris does a nice job as the stoic and seemingly invincible antagonist. I was hoping we would get a more over-the-top performance from Ed (similar to other great performances The Abyss & The Rock) but his quiet, silent, and deadly portrayal as the Nazi top sniper works just as well.

When I heard about George Lucas started plans for Episode 1 back in 1995, I was exited about it. In 1998 i've seen the trailers and red articles and i really wasn't expecting the greatest movie ever, but i was expecting unique eye candy, great action scenes, cool characters and also a little more depth into the Jedi mythology.I didnt see it in theaters but i did here the negative reviews, And when I first saw it I totally accept the film. It was on that same level with Matrix but the depth of Episode 1 was what hindered it. My biggest problems were with the little developement of Characters and the many childish humour. The childish humour just didn't  fit in with a movie about Trade Federations and Republics and all this heavy story. Obi-Wan and Darth Maul were the coolest characters but very under used. Most of the time Obi-Wan is just standing around in the background and Darth Maul had just 2 lines before his FINAL CUT (sorry, bad pun).The movie had many of the feelings that made Episode 4 great but the feeling is sadly brief. But really is there any way that Lucas could have prevented this film from being scrutinized with all that hype created by many fans and the Media. I doubt anybody could. Under the circumstances, Phantom Menace was done very prefessionally and creatively. The only thing missing was the wit, which had most of it's impact on Empire.One other dissapointment was that the story was a bit confused. It wasn't clear bout where it was going or which audience it was for. However that happens to many movies. Compared to the usual Brainless Summer flicks, The Phantom Menace was a visual classic. I loved the epic landscape, the pod race, the Jedi\/sith 3 way battle, the droid vs. Gungan battle (The first part any way) and the dogfight with the droids. Phantom Menace had some really good ideas but many of them didn't come of as well. Jar Jar for example. A CGI character as part of a live action cast is really cool idea but Jar Jar is just to silly for adults or kids to take seriously.But hey I still loved this film for what it is, the only other blockbusters i'd put over it is Matrix, Star wars Episode 4 and 5, Crouching Tiger and Gladiator. And Episode 2 should do better since the fans are now doubting George Lucas' ability to surpass the first trilogy. I'm going to see it regardless because Star Wars is the type of movies i like to see. and not many movies these days have that Unique original edge.

First, Jennifer Lopez shows off her acting skills quite brilliantly, definitely the best I've ever seen her!!  She should do more dramatic roles just to prove that she isn't just some ex girlfriend of a rapper who can sing and dance.  Second, the previews do this movie no justice at all.  I'm not going to give away why, but they are downright misleading.  So, for all of you who have decided not to see the movie because you think it looks questionable based on what you've seen in the preview or you have no faith in Ms. Lopez's acting skills, You have been mislead!!!!  Trust me, I was, and I'm extremely glad that I gave this movie a chance.This movie is at the heart of what it means to be in a relationship with someone.  Not just the typical kind of relationship, but any kind.  Family, friends, co-workers, lovers.  It's all there, and not crammed in for time or plot mind you, but it all fits into the movie's scheme perfectly.  It not only left me feeling for the film's characters, but also feeling for those who have written their parts in the story of my own life, and that's what makes this movie not only a joy to watch, but important.
