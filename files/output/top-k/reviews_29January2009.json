Everything just fits here, the road to h*ll for each character just couldn't be portrayed any better. Visuals, acting, plot, message, pace...everything just hit me like a full-speeding freight train! Brutal! It is a horrible, devastating, gruesome to watch. And that's exactly how it should be, cause that's how drugs are! Drugs WILL kill you, and they'll do it slowly, painful and messy. First they'll destroy your brain, then your body and just slowly drag all life out of you. Drugs are most definitely one of the most horrific things on this earth. And still, I couldn't keep my eyes from it. I just had to follow Harry, Sarah, Marion and Tyrones destroyals of themselves, to know the end. It was a very special feeling to be both repulsed and fascinated at the same time.Another thing that fits 110% is the soundtrack. Wow! It's a fabulous score in itself, it's somewhat beautiful, scary, horrible, sad and addictive all at once, just like the picture is.Requiem for a Dream is perfect. Personally, I think this H*LLRIDE should be shown to every 13-year old on the globe. If that wouldn't drastically cut down the number of addicts I'd be surprised. Thank you Darren Aronofsky, thank you every person involved for giving us such an extraordinary powerful anti-drug movie! 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"29 January 2009","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Requiem for a Dream is probably the most powerful film I have ever seen.
