If you don't, no amount of explaining can change your mind. If you do, the details are endlessly enjoyable.Part of the joke that's The Trouble With Harry is that nothing happens. Hitchcock's anti-Hitchcock film defies expectations for action, shock, mayhem, suspense, spectacular climaxes on national monuments, etc. Instead, it's a New England cross-stitch of lovingly detailed writing, acting, photography, directing and editing.Saul Steinberg's title illustration tells you exactly what you're in for. One long pan of a child's drawing of birds and trees . . . ending with a corpse stretched out on the ground as Directed by Alfred Hitchcock briefly appears.So meticulously is The Trouble With Harry conceived, the only two images in the title art that are NOT trees, plants or birds are a house with a rocking chair on its porch and that corpse. The film literally plays in reverse of the title sequence -- from little Arnie's (Jerry Mathers, pre-Beaver. The boy who drew the titles?) discovery of the corpse, back to the home with the rocking chair, as Hitchcock's final joke puts the audience safely to bed. A double bed, in this case.What's the film about? Oh, Great Big Themes like Life and Death, Youth and Age, Love and Hate, Guilt and Innocence, Truth and Lies, Art and Pragmatism -- packaged with deceptive simplicity.The hero, Sam Marlowe (John Forsythe), is an artist. The man the child who drew the titles (Arnie, or someone like him) might have become. His name is an amalgamation of two of hard-boiled fiction's greatest detectives Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe. Indeed, Sam Marlowe functions here as a sort of detective. But enough of pointing out the detailed construction of this script and film repeated viewings yield far greater pleasures.Introducing Shirley MacLaine in her first screen role threw that enduring actress into an astounding mix of old pros Edmund Gwenn, Mildred Dunnock, Mildred Natwick and Forsythe. That MacLaine held the screen then, and still does 50 years later (name another major actor who can say that), validates Hitchcock's astute casting.In fact, TTWH is a tribute to cinematic acting as much as anything else. These are among the finest performances ever captured of these terrific actors. Since there are none of the expected spectacular Hitchcock sequences, nor his nail-biting tension, all that's left is for the actors to fully inhabit their characters.That they do with brilliance, efficiency and breathtaking comic timing. No pratfalls here. Just nuances.Edmund Gwenn and Mildred Natwick are the real stars. Had Hitchcock said so, the film would never have been produced. Their scenes (they receive as much if not more screen time together than Forsythe and MacLaine) are possibly the most delightful (and yes, romantically and sexually tense) ever filmed of courtship in middle-and-old age. Perfectly realized in every intonation and gesture. Occasionally laugh-out-loud funny.Theirs is paralleled by the courtship of the younger stars, Forsythe and MacLaine. Love at both ends of life, young and old, and love's wonderful humor and mysterious redemption, even in the face of death -- that inconvenient corpse on the hill.Perhaps the most surprising and powerful undertow in The Trouble With Harry (one hesitates to name it because it's handled so delicately) is Sex.It is only barely present in the lines given the characters, but the subtext is always there. Occasionally, it boils over into an infinitely subtle burlesque, as in the exchange between Gwenn and Forsythe about crossing Miss Gravely's (get that name?) threshold for the first time.The look in Gwenn's eyes and the repressed joy and romantic hope in his face -- even at his stage of life -- is bliss.The coffee cup and saucer for a man's fingers; the ribbon for Miss Gravely's newly-cut hair (Wiggy cuts it in the general store -- Mildred Dunnock in another unbelievably subtle performance -- muttering, Well, I guess it will grow back.); Arnie's dead rabbit and live frog; the constantly shifting implications of guilt in the death of Harry up there on the hill; the characters' struggles to regain innocence by doing the right thing; the closet door that swings open for no apparent reason (never explained); the characters' revelations of the truths about themselves; their wishes granted through Sam's negotiations with the millionaire art collector from the city -- ALL portrayed within the conservative but ultimately flexible confines of their New England repression and stoicism (yes, the film is also a satiric comment on '50s morality) -- these details and more finally yield a rich tapestry of our common humanity, observed at a particular time and place, through specific people caught in an absurd yet utterly plausible circumstance.Nothing happens? Only somebody who doesn't know how to look and listen -- REALLY observe, like an artist \/ creator -- could reach that conclusion about The Trouble With Harry. Only a genius, like Hitchcock, would have the audacity to pull the rug out from under his audience's expectations at the height of his career by offering a profoundly subtle morality play in the guise of a slightly macabre Hallmark Card.When the final revelation arrives, in the last line that takes us home to the marital bed where love culminates and all human life begins -- yours and mine -- and draws from us a happy smile of recognition, so Hitchcock's greatest secret is revealed, more blatantly in this than any of his films.Life and death -- and all of it in between -- are a joke! Don't you get it? It's there in all his pictures. Nowhere more lovingly and less showily presented than in The Trouble With Harry. Thank you, Hitch.

Turbulence is a great ride from start to finish because it IS so predictable; you don't have to pay that close of attention and think too hard to get the plot but it is suspenseful and a kick to watch Lauren Holly's character grow in her own self-confidence by the end of the film. At the beginning of the film she's the weak little blonde who lets men walk all over her. By the end she's a flight attendant who kicks butt. Liotta, as always, does a great job portraying his character. As Ryan Weaver, a serial killer, he did his homework on the nuances that make serials serials. He uses his good looks and natural charm to get women to trust him, uses his brain to take advantage of a great situation in his favor, is emotionally manipulative, and then masterfully becomes a complete psycho all in the blink of an eye. Probably one of the best portrayals of a serial killer I've seen on the big screen for a long time. Without spoiling the big moments in the film I will say that what happens to Catherine Hicks'(Child's Play, Star Trek IV, TV's 7th Heaven) character is a shame (sad, actually), one of the funniest moments of the film (in a sicko kind of way) is when Liotta decorates the plane with some of the passengers, and the ending is pretty schlocky and cheesy. But all in all, I was certainly rooting for Lauren Holly's stewardess (sorry, she's a flight attendant) when she outdoes Karen Black (Airport '77) by a mile in finally landing the plane and basically telling the officials on the ground to go to hell!

Perhaps not all of it, but the important thing for me behind it all.Donny's lesson is the effect that one life can have on all those around them, or at least could have done. What you see is a good deal of happiness and enlightenment and a justice which is anarchic yet poetic is brought into the lives of others by this obviously somewhat ill young man.Yes, he's ill, that much is very clear. That night he goes to his room, having been teased by his sisters and nagged about his medication, feeling sad, his mum does try to help. Then the fuselage lands, and the crossroads has been reached. Only then do we get a glimpse of life with Donny and without him; the first, full of weirdness admittedly, but a great deal of humour and touching ordinary life stuff with love and parties and good stuff, and the second showing the people who never had the chance to have those good times either with or because of him.I have become sure that the falling fuselage is a metaphor. I am surprised to hear this called a comedy, for to me it is far from it. Yes, it has humour, but its primary purpose is to make us think, to ponder a life, a death, not to make us laugh. The second time I saw it, I cried when I realised. As a depressive, or perhaps even a schizophrenic, Donny felt under unbearable pressure as represented by the fuselage. That half of his family were aboard the plane was the irony, and almost certainly part of the metaphor for the pressure he was under.Donny, I think, killed himself; the film is telling us how much of a waste that is. I'm sure we know that much already, but that's what it said to me. And weird though he was, which of us didn't think Donny was a hero? Yet he felt himself worthless and couldn't bear his own life any more.But it's still a fantastic soundtrack.lazylaurablue ","genre":null},{"date":"5 September 2005","score":"","review":" A friend of mine brought the DVD round to have with tortilla chips and a home made salsa - and to ask me what I thought it was about.

That half of his family were aboard the plane was the irony, and almost certainly part of the metaphor for the pressure he was under.Donny, I think, killed himself; the film is telling us how much of a waste that is. I'm sure we know that much already, but that's what it said to me. And weird though he was, which of us didn't think Donny was a hero? Yet he felt himself worthless and couldn't bear his own life any more.But it's still a fantastic soundtrack.lazylaurablue ","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"5 September 2005","score":"","review":" A friend of mine brought the DVD round to have with tortilla chips and a home made salsa - and to ask me what I thought it was about. At first viewing I loved it for the sound track, but thought it was weird and didn't really understand it at all. A year later, at second viewing I thought that maybe I did. Perhaps not all of it, but the important thing for me behind it all.Donny's lesson is the effect that one life can have on all those around them, or at least could have done. What you see is a good deal of happiness and enlightenment and a justice which is anarchic yet poetic is brought into the lives of others by this obviously somewhat ill young man.Yes, he's ill, that much is very clear. That night he goes to his room, having been teased by his sisters and nagged about his medication, feeling sad, his mum does try to help. Then the fuselage lands, and the crossroads has been reached. Only then do we get a glimpse of life with Donny and without him; the first, full of weirdness admittedly, but a great deal of humour and touching ordinary life stuff with love and parties and good stuff, and the second showing the people who never had the chance to have those good times either with or because of him.I have become sure that the falling fuselage is a metaphor.

The bulk of this movie was fiction, utter BS, lies trumped up as docudrama, fiction, besmirching the names of those who lost their lives. There was no love affair between the real Captains Billy Tyne and Linda Greenlaw but the sleazy Hollywood vacuously untalented writers tried that angle. They tried a lot of angles, all disgraces to the real people to which this movie, which I'd say is loosely based on real events... but all they did is take names of people and places, then come up with their tripe, lies, fiction if you could call it that. The writers and producers and hell, the actors, should all be ashamed. Proceeds should go to the families who lost the loved ones. And the people that died on the boat, it's never been known\/proved how she went down, so that part too is a disgrace to those who lost their lives. Yes, spoilers, whatever, the crew dies, but how they did has never been known.No wonder Sebastian Junger was horrified when he saw what William Wittliff had done with his very good, gripping book by the same name as the movie. You want to hear facts and what these people, the community, was about, go buy and read the book A Perfect Storm. If you're the ignorant type too stupid to read (the typical American moviegoer this piece of trash was aimed at), just avoid the movie out of respect to the people this movie besmirches.
