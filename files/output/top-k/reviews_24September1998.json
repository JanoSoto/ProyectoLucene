[{"date":"24 September 1998","score":"","review":"  I know that it's hard, but try to imagine the following an MTV movie ... with *substance*!  That is, try to envision a full-throttle sensory assault where the rapid-fire cuts, quick changes of perspective and other assorted A-V tricks all serve a storytelling *purpose* rather than merely being employed to distract you from noticing that there IS no story.Can't do it, can you?Believe it or not, this seemingly impossible feat has been brilliantly pulled off by German new-wave wunderkind Tom Tykwer in his third feature, RUN LOLA RUN (Lola Rennt in German). It was by far the most innovative film that I saw at the Toronto Film Festival, and it also earned the loudest applause.The film starts with a phone call between a pair of young twentysomethings. On one end is Lola (Franka Potente) the obviously nonconformist (she sports died-red hair and tattoos) daughter of a local banker; on the other is her brooding, small-time hoodlum boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu). The situation is this due indirectly to Lola not meeting him earlier because her motorbike got stolen when she went for cigarettes, Manni has lost a bag with 100,000 deutschemarks that he was running on a courier mission for his boss.  The boss has been known to maim underlings who steal so much as a beer from him.  Manni has to deliver the money to the boss at noon sharp. It's 1140.Manni tells Lola that he has no choice but to rob a large supermarket near the pay phone where he's calling from. Lola emphatically urges him not to, telling him that she'll meet him by the store by noon with the money he needs. She then goes tearing out of her apartment, down the stairs (in an animated sequence), and out of the building.So begins a dazzling cinematic consideration of cause and effect -- the major ripples that even the smallest spur-of-the-moment decisions can have and the domino effect of a minimally altered event.  Tykwer has ingeniously created a structure that permits you to see multiple ramifications of singular changed events.  One of his many effective video techniques is to freeze the picture after Lola bumps (or almost bumps) into someone, impose the words AND THEN... on the screen, and follow these words with a rapid series of still photographs showing what subsequently happens to the person. Many of the divergences of fate caused by a slight variation in Lola's actions are hysterical in their extremity.You NEVER know what's going to happen next in this movie.  The pacing is frenetic (set to a great techno track, co-authored by the multi-talented Tykwer), and the surprises are never-ending.  While the idea of altered events is certainly not new to movies (Back to the Future, Groundhog Day, etc.), there has never been a treatment of the concept as bold or innovative as this one.  This is truly a groundbreaking cinematic work ... look for Hollywood to buy the remake rights and bastardize it post-haste. (I can hear the committee meeting already We've got to make the leads two wholesome, squeaky-clean kids who, through no fault of their own, get drawn into a bad situation. You know the truck that Lola almost gets hit by? Make that a PEPSI truck.)But fortunately, there WILL be a chance to see the unspoiled original in the States.  It was announced at the showing I attended that a deal has just been struck with Sony Classics.  The release date has yet to be decided, but when it opens, I suggest that you point yourself towards the theater showing it in your area and then superimpose your own name into the title.

The director, the writer, and the entire primary cast (Drew, Luke Wilson, Jake Busey, and Catherine O'Hara) were all present, introduced on stage prior to the film after about a twenty-minute delay. There was much fanfare, with the Drew fans clearly out in force.Then the movie started.  I knew that it was in trouble about five minutes in, during a scene in which police are investigating a dead man found in a park.  Why?  Because the actor wasn't even *trying* to play dead.  (Ever seen a corpse that can sit upright without back support?)It became obvious as things progressed that this was a low-budget, slapped-together film that was probably originally intended for cable or straight-to-video release. (In fact, I found out later that it's been in the can since prior to the release of THE WEDDING SINGER.)  There's *nothing* in this film that even *hints* at originality ... believe me, you've seen it all before.Drew doesn't embarrass herself, but the same can't be said for the rest of the cast.  Some of the members appear genuinely confused as to what kind of production they're in -- especially Luke Wilson, who seems locked into a state of soap opera angst for the entire film.  And Jake Busey is as hammy in the film as he was on stage for the Q&A session that followed the screening.There were sporadic chuckles, but only one real laugh during this alleged comedy. The applause at the end was strictly of the polite, country club sort. (I heard considerably more sustained laughter and genuine applause at the screening of a comedy from the Philippines during the festival, to give you some idea as to how well this film went over with a most receptive audience.)I had a considerably better time chatting about movies and computers with two people sitting beside me while waiting for Drew to make her late entrance than I did actually watching the movie.  Mark my words, this film is destined to become Comedy Central filler in short order.
