[{"date":"22 June 2005","score":"13 out of 19 people found the following review useful","review":" Ever since I've seen Gosford Park I'm convinced that Robert Altman has some real talent. The only Altman movie that I had seen before that one was Prêt-à-Porter, at least a part of it, but enough to know that I didn't like it. So when I got the chance to see this movie with the interesting title Cookie's Fortune, I gave it a try. I thought that this would be a comedy about a Chinese restaurant or something (The only thing that I knew before taping it, was that it was a comedy from Robert Altman, that's where my confusion comes from). It had nothing to do with what I thought, but I liked it nevertheless...Jewel Mae Cookie Orcutt is an older lady who lives in a small town, called Holly Springs. All the residents are peaceful, kind folk, except for her niece Camille Dixon. Cookie is a widow for several years now, but she isn't alone. Willis Richland does all her shopping and helps her wherever he can. But she is tired of living without her husband and she wants to die. She commits suicide, but when the irritating and pushy Camille discovers what her aunt has done, she decides to cover up the real story, convinced that this will have a bad influence on the good family name. Together with her shy younger sister Cora, whose estranged daughter Emma as just returned to town, she tries to make it all look like a robbery and murder. To do so, she eats the suicide note, hides the gun in the bushes and shatters some windows. The police is convinced that the murder story is true and they start looking for a suspect, Willis. Although the rest of the town is convinced Willis didn't commit the crime, an outside investigator isn't so sure. But as the truth comes out, more secrets are revealed than everybody thought existed in this quiet town...I guess it's the combination of the rather naive looking people in the town, the nice story and the fine acting that makes this movie work. Of course you expect to see some nice performances from people like Glenn Close, Julianne Moore, Liv Tyler,... but in my opinion it was Charles S. Dutton who was the most surprising of them all. He has already played some minor roles in well known movies like Alien³ and Se7en, but it was the first time that I saw him in major role and I must say that I liked it.Overall, this may not be the most original movie, but it is a nice comedy and I had some good laughs with it. Sure, it is a bit stereotypical, but that's not bad. It's a comedy and well-used stereotypes are always funny to watch. Add to this some fine acting and a nice story and what you get is a comedy that certainly deserves to be seen. I give it a 7\/10.

OK, some of them were great successes at the box office, but that still doesn't mean that you are a great director (I don't consider movies like for instance Dumb and Dumber as masterpieces either, even though they are very popular with a certain audience).

But saying that he's one of the greatest directors, just because of that, I will not. At least not until he has made another 15 or 20 great movies...With Unbreakable he has kept one of his traditions alive. He has directed the movie, produced it, has played a little role in it and has written the script for it. This time the story is about an ordinary man who suddenly becomes very special. But the seemingly ordinary and perfectly normal security guard David Dunn is not only the sole survivor of a horrific train-crash that killed 131 people, he didn't even have a scratch on him afterwards. A little later, comic book specialist and art gallery owner Elijah Price, nicknamed Mr. Glass due to his more than fragile bones, contacts him to confront him with an incredible theory he believes that Dunn is his exact opposite, that they both seem to be 'linked by a curve, but sitting on opposite ends'. He's convinced that comic books are what remains of an ancient system of storytelling, that the superheroes they are about, are based on real people and that Dunn is one of these people. At first Dunn doesn't believe him, but as he keeps thinking about it, he finds out that he has never ever been hurt or sick in his life, his physical strength is larger than normal and he has a skill which others don't...Normally I'm not a fan of movies based on comic books, so I already immediately assumed that I wouldn't like this movie either, just because of the subject.

Knowing that this was a movie based on a true story, made with Keanu Reeves and a lot of kid-actors in it, I honestly feared the worst. But after watching it I must say that it really wasn't all that bad.Sure, the story is as predictable as you can get them in Hollywood. With a desperate white guy who is forced into coaching a children's sporting team from a rough black neighborhood, you already know perfectly what to expect and of course he will only keep doing his job because of a beautiful lady at first (the kids school teacher), but in the end he will learn the true value of these kids' will to win and to make something of their lives, so they can get out of the neighborhood. No the movie never gets far away from the stereotypes. But somehow it didn't bother me all that much for once.This is probably one of the best performances I've ever seen from Reeves (except for his roles in The Matrix and The Gift) and despite the fact that this movie isn't a comedy, the dramatic story is relieved with some nice humorous touches. I don't know anything about baseball and normally I don't care about movies with baseball as the subject either, but for once I kept watching.As a conclusion I would like to say that if you are looking for an original movie, you better start looking somewhere else, but if you want to see a drama that exceeds the average Disney boundaries, you might want to give it a try.

That's also the reason why it won't become a timeless classic it's about our current way of living, here and now, at this very moment of speaking.Kevin Spacey gives one of the best performances ever in the history of film.

I thought he was outstanding and perfectly casted as Lester Burnham.Mena Suvari and Thora Birch gave both excellent performance as well. Another great actor who was highly overlooked was Chris Cooper. He gave an outstanding performance and deserved at least an Academy Award Nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. But unfortunately, we all know he still had to wait a couple of years before he finally got some recognition, and this for another brilliant performance by him, this time in Adaptation..What more can I say about American Beauty?

And I can perfectly understand that you'd WANT to make a sequel to the original movie.. because leaving the first movie somehow left mysteries behind and you'd want to dive into the universe to find out more about it.. The problem about the rest of the series is that they just don't work in my opinion. Elements do, but as a whole Nope. I felt number 2 kind of had a good idea, trying to follow up the original movie.. It was OK, the point and plot was there. It just wasn't as good of a movie as the original, but a nice try at least. A mediocre sequel, but with some highlights even though. This third installation here is a whole other story. It starts off well though, presenting us Patricia Arquette in an early role... an insomniac girl not daring to sleep, but does and has a nightmare about Freddy(good scene), going crazy and is then being put into a mental-constitution where a lot of kids seems to have the same problem with Freddy occurring in their nightmare. So far so good actually!Then its _straight_ downhill though. Steep downhill! For some reason they resurrect Nancy from the first movie and she becomes some sort of squadleader and makes some kind of dream-team to kill Freddy in their collective dream. The silly thing is how its done though. The acting is not convincing, and nobody makes any sense. It turns into some sort of adventure movie... and the clichés boils over with the kids high fiving each other all the time and learning to use special powers in their dreams to defeat Freddy together. Ugh. Few things are more embarrassing. Of course they overuse Freddy as well, too. He's not scary anymore, he's just mean and sadistic without any reason. He has some quite good moments though, as the TV-movie comment and such. Still, this is the point where the series already seems to have run out of gas. One thing that can be deemed a s good thing is that they in this movie reveal more about Freddy's past.. and to one point that is a good thing.. but then there's some serious plot holes that kind of ruins it as well. It makes no sense that when they find the real burnt body of Freddy Kreuger in reality and it suddenly becomes alive and is even murderous? Huh?

It turns into some sort of adventure movie... and the clichés boils over with the kids high fiving each other all the time and learning to use special powers in their dreams to defeat Freddy together. Ugh. Few things are more embarrassing. Of course they overuse Freddy as well, too. He's not scary anymore, he's just mean and sadistic without any reason. He has some quite good moments though, as the TV-movie comment and such. Still, this is the point where the series already seems to have run out of gas. One thing that can be deemed a s good thing is that they in this movie reveal more about Freddy's past.. and to one point that is a good thing.. but then there's some serious plot holes that kind of ruins it as well. It makes no sense that when they find the real burnt body of Freddy Kreuger in reality and it suddenly becomes alive and is even murderous? Huh? Everything about this movie was just so stupid when added together. Elements was quite good, but they just drowns in the misery of the wholeness. So, if you are ever going to watch Nightmare On Elm Street and haven't already.. See number 1 and try not to see the others.

Sneaking up to the Eiffel tower after closing where Andy plans on pulling off the biggest daredevil stunt ever, by Bungee jumping off the tower! Before he can pull the stunt off, they hear someone approach the tower & so they hide & watch as a pretty young girl named Serafaine attempts to commit suicide by leaping off the top. Before she can commit her act, Andy saves her by bungee jumping off the tower to save her from falling to her death knocking himself unconscious in the process. After being let out of the hospital Andy & his buds attempt to track her down. Upon finding her home, they are invited by her friend to an underground night club, while there Andy & his buddies are attacked by werewolves, with his pal Brad being horribly mutilated, while his other friend is abducted & taken back to Serafaine's home & locked in a cage where he attempts to escape. Andy is bitten in the process & soon learns from the disembodied spirit of his dead friend Brad that he will transform into a werewolf unless he kills himself before the next full moon. Andy then sets out to find another way to save Serafaine & himself from the werewolf curse & stop Serafaine's friend & his band of followers from mutilating more victims or worse, turning more innocent people into werewolves. Despite the title, An American Werewolf In Paris has no real connections to the original film whatsoever, minus the werewolves, the disembodied, mangled spirits that visit their killers & the title, the film is a complete in name only sequel, in fact none of the original cast or crew or characters return & none of the events of the original are ever mentioned here either. On the downside, An American Werewolf In Paris much like most sequels done to films that never asked for sequels, is nowhere near as good as the original film, despite a much improved budget ($22 million!), An American Werewolf In Paris lacks the scares, comedy, suspense, tension & atmosphere of the original, while the comedy here is pretty funny at times, most of the jokes & humour are rather juvenile & many of the scares falls flat due to poor build up. The CGI werewolves while impressive for what they are, are nowhere near as good as Rick Bakers hairy beast monstrosity from the first film. While the first film had the perfect blend of horror & comedy, An American Werewolf In Paris is seemingly unable to pull off the same feat, at times the comedy undercuts the horror, robbing the film of the impact it could have had, had the horror & comedy been balanced well.On the plus side, while An American Werewolf Paris is nowhere near as good as the first, it still has a lot going for it, in particular with the direction of the film, director ANDY WALLER does fairly well behind the camera (He also serves as writer & Executive Producer) managing to capture all the werewolf carnage at all the right angles & manages to soak up the scenery of Paris. The acting is really good here with each actor making their character that much more fun & interesting. The film also delights itself in some funny on target jabs at the french culture as well, which I found to be quiet enjoyable. The score is also really good & the film does have a few scary moments of suspense on hand, in particular in the scene set in the basement where we see one of Andy's buddies trying to escape from a legless werewolf that is pursuing him, only for him to try & escape out a door which when opens only leads into a closet! All in all, An American Werewolf In Paris while far from being a great horror movie is still plenty of fun for fans & has many fine moments to help elevate it above most unnecessary sequels. If you're ever in the mood for just a fun time waster & not much more you should enjoy it.*** stars ","genre":null},{"date":"22 June 2005","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" American Andy McDermott is on a daredevil tour across Europe with his two best college buds.

Joel Schumacher and George Clooney have completely ruined what Tim Burton & Michael Keaton had begun. What Keaton and Burton achieved was magnificent, this is quite frankly a shameful joke. So where to begin. Well we might as well start with the plot and storyline. Anyone who thought Superman IV had the worst plot of any action movie ought to check this out.

Think for instance of Top Gun, one of the most popular movies about this subject at that time. But even today the fear for nuclear attacks hasn't diminished. Today they fear extremists and terrorists rather than the Russians and that's exactly the idea on which the story of this movie was based.The Sum of All Fears starts with the sudden death of the Russian President. He is quickly succeeded by a man whose politics are virtually unknown to Washington. The CIA is convinced that he is a hardliner and because the United States is very critical of the Russians' treatment of Chechneya, they fear the man. And their fear becomes truth when the Russian President tells them that Chechneya is an internal issue and none of their concern. CIA analyst Jack Ryan, who did research on the man, doesn't think he is a hardliner, but while Ryan and his boss, Bill Cabot, are inspecting disarmament at a Russian nuclear site, 3 Russian scientists have mysteriously disappeared. Although the Russians have explanations for their absence, none of them are true.

It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and it made me cry thinking that I would never get my three hours back. I feel bad for wasting my time on this complete BORE of a film. It has too much romantic involvement,and the acting is awful. Compared to The Loin King (which was one of the BEST films I have had the pleasure of viewing) it would have kicked its sappy butt. Everyone likes that stupid love story? But what about those people who are SICK of hearing everyone yell, I'm king of the world! when really, you're just an idiot who got overpaid to die at the end.

It is side-splittingly hilarious,well-acted, anti-Establishment, borders on parody and has a storyline that belongs in a dramatic film. And it is a western comedy, another scarce category. Any account of this film must begin with its story, an unusual one as noted. Cakthrine Ballou meets several strangers on her way west, by train, to rejoin her father Frankie. Soon after her arrival, he is murdered. The authorities refuse to do anything. What happens next is, Cat Ballou and her friends, who happen to be he outlaws she had met, join with her Indian hired hand have already sent for a gunfighter--Kid Shellene who was supposed to protect her father. Falling in love with her, the Kid sobers up, dispatches, his own brother; then the gang ride off to new adventures, with the Kid drinking again because she's refused him for another of her henchman and they're wanted for having helped hasten the demise of the man who had had her father killed. Th settings and locales in the film are standard western ones, and very fine; the film is well-made without ever appearing to be slick. So is the music by Frank de Vol and unusual songs scattered throughout. The piece's able director Elliot Silverstein has coaxed some of their best work ever from Jane Fonda as Cat, Michael Callan as her outlaw fiancée, Dwayne Hickman as a bogus preacher, John Marley as her father, Reginald Denny, J.C. Flippen and Bruce Cabot as the criminal element and Lee Marvin as the besotted gunfighter and his killer brother. There is an unusual narration, sung expertly and winningly Subby Kaye and Nat King Cole. The costumes by Bill Thomas are wonderful, and there is a rough-and-ready style about the work that millions have found engaging. The dialogue from a novel is well-above average also. This is a film that bears more than one viewing; it is clever, intentionally funny and quire well-constructed. Recommended to anyone who resents bullies or simply enjoys a well-earned laugh twelve. Marvin's best role, of a fine career. ","genre":null},{"date":"22 June 2005","score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Cat Ballou is a rarity as a film in many ways.

But as a film, taken away from its context historically, it is not such a great film. The acting in many cases is sub-par; the dialog is painful to listen to at times; and Luke Skywalker has got to be the whiniest kid that ever lived (asside from, perhaps, his father, as it turns out).Still, STAR WARS stands alone as a fun, entertaining ride through the stars with an adventure that some fans, these days, can practically quote line-for-line.George Lucas has made some slight modifications to the film over the years -- the most note-worthy being the Han Solo-Greedo match-up.

When it was released, people began standing in line for hours in order to watch this movie for the fifteenth time -- something that had never happened before. STAR WARS changed the way we think about movies; it changed the way we market movies; it changed the way we think about sci-fi and fantasy in film; it killed the second STAR TREK series in pre-production at the time; it was important.Let me say that again STAR WARS was important. That fact cannot be stressed enough. STAR WARS launched George Lucas into history, and created an industry legacy ILM, THX, and so on. Suddenly, the idea that special effects needed to be of superior quality, and that the technology of movie making was something that needed to move forward became evident.STAR WARS was a great film in the sense that it was so important. But as a film, taken away from its context historically, it is not such a great film. The acting in many cases is sub-par; the dialog is painful to listen to at times; and Luke Skywalker has got to be the whiniest kid that ever lived (asside from, perhaps, his father, as it turns out).Still, STAR WARS stands alone as a fun, entertaining ride through the stars with an adventure that some fans, these days, can practically quote line-for-line.George Lucas has made some slight modifications to the film over the years -- the most note-worthy being the Han Solo-Greedo match-up. Although I am not really happy with that particular change, these are George's films and he can do what he wants with them. This makes George Lucas and his films unique in the industry George really does not care if his films are popular, or if anyone likes them at all. Geroge makes movies for George to enjoy. We are all just along for the ride. ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"22 June 2005","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" ...

When one of the boys, Jack asks about a pentagram that is scrawled on the wall, both boys are asked to leave & to stay on the road, beware the moon & stay away from the moors. While trekking away, both men get talking & forget, travelling off the road & thus getting lost, where they are both viciously attacked by what appears to be a very large wolf. Shot & killed by the townsfolk who go out to look for the boys, with the survivor of the attack David, sees a dying man riddled with bullets but no wolf only to pass out & awaken in a hospital in London three weeks later, where he is informed his friend is dead & that the police & townsfolk claim that Jack & his friend were attacked by an escaped mental patient, a conviction they stick by, despite Jack's insistence that both he & his friend were attacked by a rather large wolf. David soon starts to suffer from very strange, bizarre nightmares that feel very realistic wherein he is running naked in the woods chasing down a deer which he soon devours, turning into a monster to attack his nurse Alex, & travelling through the woods like an animal & watching his family being slaughtered by Nazi monsters in his home, dreams which just get more & more disturbing, bloody & violent. While at the hospital, David is visited by his badly mutilated friend Jack, who insists that David make away with himself, otherwise he will turn into a werewolf & attack more people, causing them to wander in a state of mutilation as spirits which will stay with David unless he severs the werewolf's bloodline by killing himself. David shrugs it off as mere nightmares at first, he falls in love & moves in with Alex his nurse & tries to resume a normal life, but strange things soon begin to happen, cats & dogs all the sudden down right hate him, he no longer has an appetite & he feels bothered. Soon the full moon rises & David discovers much to his horror that his long dead, badly mutilated friends visits were no nightmares or even hallucinations, as David transforms in a vicious, violent werewolf monster! that prowls all off London savagely mutilating three street people, a young married couple & a man in the subway, whose angry spirits soon come to haunt David. Can David find another way to end the curse without having to kill himself or is death really the only way out?An American Werewolf In London has to be without a shadow of a doubt one of the top five best werewolf movies ever made! Released the same year as THE HOWLING, both films are a prime example on how to balance genuine wit, irony & comedy, not to mention a very self aware tone with horror in a very even balance. The film has a very witty & sharp sense of humour, the gore effects here are real nasty & plentiful, while the werewolf monster suit is equally as impressive (courtesy of special effects wizard RICK BAKER) as is the really impressive on screen werewolf transformation sequences, which even to this day, despite all the advancements in special effects & CGI technology, still holds up well & puts most of, if not all of, the special effects werewolf transformations seen in many of todays current monster movies to shame. I also was really impressed with the zombie make-up done on all of David's victims, with Griffin Dunne's frequently rotting Jack being the real highlight. The suspense & tension, are very well crafted & eerie & should get even the strongest of wills who have seen their fair share of horror movies on the edge of their seats & give them a real jolt. The acting works, with each actor bringing their characters to life & making them feel very believable. The romance angle between David & Alex gels really well & works with & within the story, wherein such a plot device would only have served as a distraction in most other movies. The direction by JOHN LANDIS is really good here, as his camera captures all the horror moments at all the right angles & really soaks up the eerie atmosphere of the English moors & the characters are very well developed as is the plot. The only downside? The ending, which despite have an incredibly good build up leading up to it, is somewhat of a letdown. I was really hoping for a much tighter, more suspenseful & satisfying ending.

I feel it is an insult to the great Murnau's work of art. OKey, I can understand that maybe Herzog attempted to make a spoken version of the story. Needless to say he failed miserably. I am so curious, how could anyone mark this movie with something more than a 2?!?! Is there someone else that feels the same about this? ","genre":"Fantasy, Horror"}]
