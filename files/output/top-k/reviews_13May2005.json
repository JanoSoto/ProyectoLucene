I have never (maybe) seen any of his work; It's not interesting for me. I don't hate science fiction and futuristic films (because that's why he's known), it's just that those are not my types of movies. Anyway, I know some people that say he's great. He made Star Wars thinking he would make a trilogy, this was number 4, then he did 5 and 6; he probably thought it was over, but some years later he showed us the beginning of something we had already known the ending with Episode I and Episode II. What happens before this film, departures from a movie that has not been released yet that's Episode III.There's a time (now) where the special effects are show ups. I like to think there was a time when they were used to serve the story; for sake of entertainment. Now, plots are merely complex, but effects are totally outstanding. Hero was lauded by critics, but it was just the visuals for me; beautiful visuals, of course. Then the plot&#133;That's why I'm thinking of passing by House of Flying Daggers same actors, same director&#133;No, thanks.Well, special effects weren't remarkable in Star Wars, but they were definitely the best they had at that time. I didn't care about them, anyway, because Lucas has fun creating his own world of adventure, fantasy and whatever you want so say; but it was fun! What can you expect of some big letters flying in space that say A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away? The thing is Lucas' whole team worked their asses to develop this fantasy full of pleasure, and gave us the costumes, the sceneries, the characters&#133;Unique stuff!I wasn't alive at the time the movie was the phenomenon it was, and still is; but it's a thoroughly enjoyable ride that everyone should take the chance to experience. Getting out of TV, and very young, Mark Hamill looks natural as Luke. He seems very promising in his role; the role that assured his career's take-off. Alec Guiness passed away some years ago, with the Oscar in his merits, and the recognition for his performances; including his classy and for always remembered Obi-Wan Kenobi. In this film specifically, Carrie Fisher wasn't much used and not as pretty as her character should be. However, intelligent enough to provide the qualities that launch a career. One paragraph should be dedicated to Mr. Harrison Ford. I heard he wouldn't have a career if it wasn't for George Lucas. The whole story I won't say, but I'm glad Lucas discovered some of the genius in Ford. Lucas gave Ford the character of Han Solo that would bring Indiana Jones after the trilogy. After Indiana Jones, Ford's career would be irregular, with some little peaks. But here, here&#133;Ford is magical. Incredibly natural and very good&#133;Star Wars is one of those movies that make you be supportive with the characters. We want their good, we want to join them in their journey and watch them survive; even when we already know what's going to happen.

Instantly, my mind rushed with many vivid, powerful memories that, I truly think, have had an impact on my childhood years. My childhood imagination was profoundly driven by watching this movie. Last night, I really thought about my youth. Reminiscing those years, it brought a tear to my eye; BLT's beautifully crafted nature stays ingrained in your mind. When you think about the movie, it's easy to stop what you're doing and just think on those years of innocence, starting off fresh, and not knowing what you have until you lose it. For the first time in a long time, thinking about BLT last night has really unfolded everything that was conveyed, sort of as if it were saying, Now do you understand what all this means?When I was only 3, I remember going down to visit my grandparents and I would refer to myself as the Lamp and my dad as the Radio. When I was 4, my dad video taped me and my brother talking to Santa Claus about our Christmas lists and I clearly remember referring to myself, yet again, as the lamp. With my curious young mind, I grew a deep interest in ceiling fans that everyone in my family remembers. This mostly has to do with the scene in the dark room of the fat, greedy man's shop of old appliances where the fan spun into the air; their gadgets and plugs moving about. And the times I used to draw whatever was on my mind as a young kindergarten student, it would usually involve landfills with cars, ceiling fans, and even this idea of becoming the entrepreneur of an appliance shop. Now, I don't have these same interests anymore, but BLT is not a sterile cartoon; if it were enough to be remembered now, it surely has made a point. It does this using innovative plots; really, who would have come up with the idea of appliances running the show and personifying virtually every modern machine? Silly little details that are subliminally presented in the movie I remember to the core and it was reinforced by my interests. To the person who brought up the cheesy Tootie Fruity song, it took me just moments to remember everything that happened in the first scene. The radio wakes up blaring the song and the movie kicks off. Cute, cheesy, but it stays with you. The essence of memory is something so hard to explain, yet the mystery of how it works is what makes it so amazing.The more I think about each scene, the more incredibly vivid memories I have. From the dark repair shop of the fat business man, I now remember all the appliances floating in the air, shunning their worthlessness and inviting our heroes to join their fate, while the Toaster and Blanky cringing in a crib; Kirby sitting on the floor being confronted by an oven. The landfill with the decrepit cars singing until their last dreaded moments of existence as they become aluminum cubes (one by one); the magnet chasing the appliances around; it all comes back to me and I haven't seen the movies in several years. I can almost play the entire movie again in my head; I still remember what the characters sounded like.You really will never ever forget this movie even the first time you let it sink in. As a child, every message presented is subliminal; but the colors, cute plot, and details stay in your mind. All of this goes on, only to be unleashed in your more mature years when you reflect on your youth and realize the messages BLT explained about society, how we cope with abandonment\/loneliness, working as a team, etc. Now do you understand what this all means? In a world shattered by apathy, cynicism, and waste, the sense of hope is manifested in the pursuit of the characters to find happiness again. Clearly, this is one childhood memory hidden in the unconscious mind that Sigmund Freud would likely refer to! I don't understand why, but no other movie I have ever watched in my life has had this same effect as the Brave Little Toaster had on me. Even though I am nearly 18, I almost want to go out and buy the DVD to just let it rejuvenate me, a return to innocence, and believing in your highest ambitions. It's more than a child's movie. True, you watch it as a child; but everything comes together when you're older. I overwhelmingly recommend this film to any parent.

We watched it in history class, and at the beginning my friends and I, who didn't know what swing kids were, thought that the title sounded somewhat jazzy and lighthearted.How wrong we were. As the movie changed from the story of three teenage friends to the story of the choices every person in the nation had to make, we were all utterly captivated. True, I go to an all-girls school, and so the presence of Christian Bale probably didn't hurt our liking of the movie. But it wasn't just that.The story, set in the late 1930's, is about the Swing Kids movement in the youth at the time that Hitler was gaining power and Germany was becoming more and more fascist. Fascism was all about conformity, being the same everyone else and putting the state in front of yourself. Swing dancing was and still is clearly about being an individual, and as a result, the swing clubs were slowly being banned. The swing kids remained defiant, even making up their own mockery of the Nazi salute Swing Heil! SPOILER ALERT Each progressive scene at the Cafe Bismarck gets worse. The first shows a happy evening, the second a close call, the third the official closing of the club, and the last is the end of the movie.SPOILER ENDED The movie focuses on three teenage guys, Peter, Thomas, and Arvid. As the movie progresses, it's clear that the three are all searching for something. Thomas, who has a cold relationship with his father, is looking for acceptance. Peter, whose father mysteriously disappeared, returned home, and died, is looking for answers. And Arvid, a cripple who plays the guitar, is looking for a way out of a society that is beginning to sicken him.The rest of the movie is about the choices that each one makes as the fascist society progresses around them and forces them to decide what stance they want to take.SPOILER ALERT When Peter attempts to steal a radio for his friend Arvid, he is given an unofficial ultimatum--join the HJ (Hitler Youth) or your mother and younger brother will be in danger. When Peter joins, Thomas joins too, saying that he did it because of his friendship with Peter and says that they can be HJ by day and swing kids by night.SPOILER ENDED Throughout the movie, it is clear that the three friends are drawing apart, and in the end, each makes a different choice, finding in that choice what they were looking for in the beginning.The entire movie, while maybe not entirely historically accurate, is still an amazing film. The swing music played in it is not just an element of the background, it sends its own message. The acting is mostly flawless--my only minor point is that Emil, the HJ leader, is not very convincing. But what makes the movie really work is the powerful emotions drawn out of the viewer--happiness, despair, horror, hope, betrayal. It's the only movie that has ever made me cry.As my history teacher said, In many ways, the movie is somewhat cushioned. It only shows a small part of the time period and in some ways isn't incredibly historically accurate. But it's incredibly personal, and that's what gets you. An excellent movie, 10 out of 10.

Fascism was all about conformity, being the same everyone else and putting the state in front of yourself.

It's sad this movie got such bad reviews, as I think it was misrepresented in the press since Eddie was in it.I'm very selective of the movies I watch...I'm one of the international cinema crowd also, so I tend toward deeper, more intense movies. This is a movie I've watched countless times, and I've never tired of it...and I've always cried at the end. This is one of the few movies that, to this day, still causes me to cry at the self-sacrifice and parting of the friends.This is probably because for me I see another facet of it as a modern parable...very subtle, but powerful, and poignant. This is not a movie about comedy, and funny situations with a guru...in my opinion that is simply the stage being set, and the backdrop raised, for a parable about the value of true friendship and relationships...when we move beyond simply 'using' each other in the normal progression of our daily lives, into the realm of true friends. The two high-points are 1. Ricky (Jeff) finding the better part of himself, that he never knew he had and was against much of who he thought he should be, to tell G to go, to leave the show. The virtue of self-sacrifice for the betterment of a friend. The build-up, timing, music, and dialog were well-edited and synchronized for a very poignant moment.2. And this happens again, in a wonderful way...another poignant moment as Ricky, G, and Kate meet once more on the highway to say goodbye to each other...for the last time. It's bittersweet but incredibly moving, and once again Ricky gets a glimpse of the much better part of himself, that he didn't know he had, and that has the potential to emerge. It's very beautiful and touching. And we sense that they are all on a better road for the journey for the experience.What touches me most deeply is the strong sense of true friends made, how they touch and effect our lives, and then move apart. We'll probably never see each other again, but we will never forget each other and what we did for each other to make our lives a little brighter and better. I've had several true friends like that, and that chord strikes beautifully here.I strongly recommend this film. It is a great parable of the coming of true friendship.

Thankfully, he also forges a powerful friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman) a fellow lifer who learns to appreciate Andy's spirit and determination. Later, when Andy set's himself up as the resident financial adviser to the warden and guards, he manages to earn an odd form of respect from all he comes in contact with. Based on the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, it is story about friendship, hope and the triumph of the human spirit over incredible hardship. Hows that for a clichéd synopsis? This may summarize what the film is about, but it does not explain why this film resonates so much with audiences worldwide. Now, I remember the first time I read this short story by Stephen King. I opened up Different Seasons because I wanted to read The Body, the novella which is the basis for Stand By Me. After I had finished that one I saw this oddly titled story at the beginning of the anthology. I started reading it and did not stop till later that day, when, with tears in my eyes, I put the book down. My first thought was that was a great story! and I was amazed that King could write something so inspirational. Then I thought to myself that would make a great picture.A year or so later - this film was released, and I went to the theater with high hopes. The memories of this story were still cemented in my imagination (I had actually pictured William Sadler as Red when I read the book) and I was not disappointed by what I saw. In fact, If anything I was even more impressed with the film because Darabont managed to capture the nuance and feel of the original story so perfectly. The look and feel of the prison and the characterizations of Red and Andy where inspired. Nobody carries the regal dignity and wisdom of Red like Morgan Freeman, and Tim Robbins was perfectly enigmatic as Dufresne. Add to that Thomas Newmans stoic and moving score, and what I saw was nothing short of movie magic. I walked out of the theater, my heart soaring and knowing I had just watched a great picture. I have only felt that way a few times before or since (Field of Dreams and Dances With Wolves are two good examples) and I still get that feeling when I watch it at home.This is more than a prison escape movie - it is, to me, a film about the friendship between Red and Andy. I think so many men are fans of this picture because Andy and Red have a connection that we would all like to have with our friends, and that only a few of us are fortunate enough to share or experience. I went to a marriage retreat recently, and when the men and women were split up and asked to describe their likes and dislikes, the question of movies came up. I think it is interesting to note that all of us men listed this film as one of our top ten.King has a way of writing language that is both common and lyrical at the same time, and his characters have a wisdom and moral certainty that connects with the reader. Kings skill as a writer is especially evident in this picture with Freemans' narration. A lot of the lines which he spoke are direct from the book, and this is a testament to Darabont's respect for that written word. The screenplay he wrote was more than just a faithful adaptation - it is an homage to the wonderful story King wrote.I have read a lot of reviews and comments on this site that refer to this film as over-hyped and cliched, and to some extent this may be true. This movie doesn't have a plot thats overly complicated, and the characters (specifically the warden and prison guards) may be slightly two-dimensional - but I think that was done on purpose. I believe Stephen King wrote this story as an example of how a simple concept like hope can pull someone through a very difficult time - and it is this idea that appeals to so many people. This movie doesn't make any social commentary, and it is certainly not PC - which is refreshing. Too many films today are nothing more than political soapboxes for the film-maker, and unfortunately the cynics and idealists prefer that sort of commentary to simple story-telling. It has been said by fans of this movie, that It's a Wonderful Life was pooh-poohed by critics when it was released as sentimental tripe - and if the same film had been made today, it would be similarly scoffed and mocked with abandon for it's old-fashioned sensibilities. Now, people look at it as a classic, and rightly so, because it has a simple message that people love to hear, over and over. That's what The Shawshank Redemption is like. It's just a great story about friendship that is told well, and most people appreciate that and that is why its one of the top ten films on this website.Get busy living, or get busy dying.

It has been said by fans of this movie, that It's a Wonderful Life was pooh-poohed by critics when it was released as sentimental tripe - and if the same film had been made today, it would be similarly scoffed and mocked with abandon for it's old-fashioned sensibilities. Now, people look at it as a classic, and rightly so, because it has a simple message that people love to hear, over and over. That's what The Shawshank Redemption is like. It's just a great story about friendship that is told well, and most people appreciate that and that is why its one of the top ten films on this website.Get busy living, or get busy dying.

The airplane crashes into one of the lakes, killing the pilot. The other three men -- a well-read businessman (Hopkins), the young man who intends to kill him and steal his wife and money (Baldwin), and a black guy with Rastafarian dreadlocks (Perrineau) who provides a bit of comic relief until, in a savage scene, he's eaten alive by a monstrous grizzly. Hopkins and Baldwin trek their way out of the woods and are finally rescued by a helicopter, but not before Baldwin gives up the ghost from an accidental wound.It really didn't start off too promisingly. This territory has been staked out by Jack London. I expected Hopkins and Baldwin to become vicious enemies. (Maybe Baldwin would straighten out at the end, or maybe he's d kill Hopkins before somehow being snuffed himself.) But the writers set themselves a more difficult task than simply putting together another action movie like Hidden, in which simple-minded characters are driven by simple-minded motives.Baldwin turns out not to be a frothing murderous psychopath. And Hopkins turns out not to be a hard-hearted pragmatist. Instead, Hopkins develops from an ordinary corporate pirate into an intelligent and, most important, generous and compassionate man who comes to like Baldwin even after he knows Baldwin wants to kill him.Baldwin may or may not have changed from a would-be murderer into Hopkins' friend -- the movie isn't clear on the point. But he's likable anyway. He becomes very human. He suffers without over dramatizing his suffering. I can't say I feel exactly one hundred percent, Charles, he tells Hopkins as he's bleeding to death.Nobody would expect a survival-in-the-woods movie from a writer like David Mamet, any more than we'd expect one from Neil Simon or Tennessee Williams. (What could they do, insult the bear to death?) But here it is. And the script is kind of witty too, allowing for a few touches of humor between the characters. I think I'll make three examples explicit because if you're not expecting them you might miss them.Hopkins and Baldwin are having their first argument about Hopkins' wife. Perrineau catches up to them, winded, and asks, Who's this we're talking about? Baldwin We're talking about Fanny Farmer here -- the mother of level measurement. I don't care what anyone says. That's a clever line. In another scene Baldwin is sitting at the side of a lake after a narrow escape from a man-eating bear. Hopkins strolls up to him. Baldwin Well, I guess this is a little different for you. Hopkins Oh? Baldwin Well, I mean it's a lot different than snorting coke off some girl's hipbone. (Long pause) Hopkins In what way? Baldwin cracks up but Hopkins plays it perfectly straight.Later, after the two men have killed the bear and eaten part of him (it doesn't seem to bother them that the bear has eaten Perrineau, so in a sense they --- well, never mind), Hopkins muses, I've always wanted to do something that was -- unequivocal. Baldwin I'd say this qualifies. If old Smokey there had popped up a year ago you'd have been calling your lawyer. Hopkins No -- I'd never do that to an animal.I had a little problem with the plot. I don't see why Elle MacPherson couldn't have been along on the trip, survived the crash, and had her clothes torn from her bit by bit in the course of the movie. Maybe she could have ripped off a strip of her hampering outer garments to provide a tourniquet for someone. Well, nothing's perfect.While we're mentioning imperfections, this movie follows the convention that once a minor character is killed nobody grieves for him. The pilot dies and he's not even mentioned as the survivors struggle out of the lake. The poor black guy gets torn apart and we never hear his name again. And no movie about people lost in a wilderness seems able to avoid the cliché of the search-and-rescue plane that just barely misses them, even as they jump and yell and wave their arms in a frenzy.I also don't know they had such trouble finding which direction was south. In the Boy Scouts I learned that moss always grows on the north side of tree trunks. Moreover, at those high latitudes, the sun at its zenith is south. When it rises, it comes up in the southeast. When it sets, it goes down in the southwest. And at night, naturally, you can use Polaris, the north star, which you can find not only by using Cassiopeia but the much more prominent big dipper. What's all this nonsense about a magnetized needle and a metal belt buckle? They got the wooden spears right, though. In most cultures the points are hardened over a fire.I kind of enjoyed it, despite the absence of MacPherson. I once knew an anthropologist who was employed by the government to parachute into an uninhabited area with nothing but a knife and canteen and see if he could get out alive.

'Die Hard 2' was cool, and he gave the world 'Cliffhanger', one of the most awesome action movies ever. That's right, you little punks, 'Cliffhanger' rules, and we all know it.Sly plays Gabe Walker, a former rescue climber who is 'just visiting' his old town when he is asked to help a former friend, Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker), assist in a rescue on a mountain peak. Walker obviously came back at a convenient time, because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow). Qualen & co. have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the U.S. government somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and they really would like it back...Essentially, 'Cliffhanger' is another 'Die Hard' clone. Just trade in the confines of Nakatomi Plaza to the open mountain ranges of the Rocky Mountains, complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him mortal. Naturally, that set up is totally ripped to shreds soon enough, as Stallone's character avoids quite a large number of bullets with ease, and slams face-first into several rock faces with no apparent side-effects. After all, isn't that what action movies are all about?'Cliffhanger' is one of the most exciting action movies around. A showcase of great scenes and stunts. One of the early stunts is one of the best stunts I've ever seen in a movie, and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning, it maintains its action awesomeness. John Lithgow's lead villain is entertaining, and one bad dude.

The framework for this movie is a trade federation blockade and politics of a galactic senate. Great. Within this framework we have a couple of Jedi occasionally hacking their way through various CG robots, some *extremely* irritating and unconvincing CG characters, a rather good but overlong pod race in the middle and a dull denouement where yet more CG characters fight CG robots inter-cut with the Jedis fighting a baddie called Darth Maul. CG is okay in doses, but it does not make up for a saggy plot or other deficiencies.Darth Maul is the most interesting thing about the film and he is woefully underused. Aside from being a bad ass fighter, we have no better clue who he is or what he wants. Recall previous Star Wars where the duels were accompanied by a duel of words - Obi Wan Kenobi squaring up to Vader, or Vader vs Luke Skywalker. The words were as interesting as the fighting itself and I bet most fans can recall them. The Jedis and Darth Maul size each other up, and fight in near silence. What a waste. As someone wrote for Slate (if I recall), why not use the opportunity for Maul to expound his beliefs and perhaps even semi-convince the maverick Jedi played by Liam Neeson of what he is trying to do.Aside from this, not much else sticks in the mind. The acting is universally wooden, thanks no doubt to the amount of CG filling each scene - Mr Neeson stand in front of this green screen and say your lines to the tennis ball on a stick. We'll fill in who you're talking to and the space port you're standing in later.. The child actor playing Annakin is irritating, and the CG Jar Jar is even more so.I have to say that Attack of the Clones went some way to mitigate the annoying Jar Jar by making him the tragic instigator of the Clone Wars. But if ever Lucas ever re-cuts these films (as he is wont to do when his bank balance dips below several billion), he should re-voice this annoying creation and give him half as much to say.

I have spent an abnormal amount of time engaged in water cooler talk as to why the latest STAR TREK spin-off failed to last more than 4 seasons. I do consider myself a TREK fan but I am hesitant to use terms like Trekkie or Trekker. I see STAR TREK the same way I see religion. It can be a great source of comfort, it should be used in moderation and I don't want to associate with or be associated with its followers. These devoted fans by the way recently raised over 15 million dollars to keep this fifth TREK series on the air, forcing them to delay moving out of their parent's basements for at least... Well I guess they had the disposable income anyway. Don't get me wrong, some of my best friends are Trekkies or Trekkers. Go rent the documentary TREKKIES and you will know what I am talking about.What Gene Roddenberry pitched, as Wagon Train to the Stars became much more than what WilliamShatner described on SNL as, ...just a TV show! Roddenberry managed to address the problems of the day that would not have been addressed otherwise on TV, by using outer space as its backdrop. The show inspired many to reach for the stars by studying science. People of color and women seeing Lt. Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) on the Enterprise bridge saw a future that included them. The show inspired new technology and it's packaging. Imagine what your cell phone or home computer would look like without STAR TREK as inspiration. Gene Rodenbery's vision also showed us a future where people of all races worked and played together (including TV's first interracial kiss Plato's Stepchildren).I know that I'm making this sound bigger than just the cancellation of a TV show. I liked Enterprise and was not bothered by the multiple episode story lines. I still saw Gene Roddenberry's original intentions realized in this latest STAR TREK franchise. I liked that Captain Jonathan Archer's (Scott Bakula ) Enterprise and crew was less sophisticated than Captain Kirk's or Picard's. The bottom line is that it doesn't matter if you are battling an unknown alien threat or debating the moral implications of interfering with the development of an alien species, as long as the show is well written and well acted, that's all that matters.One of the great things about Trek is that you can never run out of story ideas. All you have to do is look at today's newsmakers, paint them green and stick them on another planet.Fear not Trekkies or Trekkers. Even though we are saying goodbye to Captain Archer's Enterprise, the franchise will live long and prosper. There is now talk about an 11th STAR TREK feature scheduled for release in 2007.

The bottom line is that it doesn't matter if you are battling an unknown alien threat or debating the moral implications of interfering with the development of an alien species, as long as the show is well written and well acted, that's all that matters.One of the great things about Trek is that you can never run out of story ideas. All you have to do is look at today's newsmakers, paint them green and stick them on another planet.Fear not Trekkies or Trekkers. Even though we are saying goodbye to Captain Archer's Enterprise, the franchise will live long and prosper. There is now talk about an 11th STAR TREK feature scheduled for release in 2007. I look forward to it, just don't expect to see me at the first screening and I definitely wont be in uniform because to quote Groucho Marx, I refuse to join any club that would have me as a member.Stay Tuned Tony Figueroa ","genre":"Documentary"},{"date":"13 May 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I'm stunned. It's hard to believe that with the cancellation of STAR TREK ENTERPRISE, for the first time in18 years there will not be a STAR TREK series on the air. I have spent an abnormal amount of time engaged in water cooler talk as to why the latest STAR TREK spin-off failed to last more than 4 seasons. I do consider myself a TREK fan but I am hesitant to use terms like Trekkie or Trekker. I see STAR TREK the same way I see religion. It can be a great source of comfort, it should be used in moderation and I don't want to associate with or be associated with its followers. These devoted fans by the way recently raised over 15 million dollars to keep this fifth TREK series on the air, forcing them to delay moving out of their parent's basements for at least... Well I guess they had the disposable income anyway. Don't get me wrong, some of my best friends are Trekkies or Trekkers. Go rent the documentary TREKKIES and you will know what I am talking about.What Gene Roddenberry pitched, as Wagon Train to the Stars became much more than what WilliamShatner described on SNL as, ...just a TV show! Roddenberry managed to address the problems of the day that would not have been addressed otherwise on TV, by using outer space as its backdrop. The show inspired many to reach for the stars by studying science. People of color and women seeing Lt. Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) on the Enterprise bridge saw a future that included them. The show inspired new technology and it's packaging. Imagine what your cell phone or home computer would look like without STAR TREK as inspiration. Gene Rodenbery's vision also showed us a future where people of all races worked and played together (including TV's first interracial kiss Plato's Stepchildren).I know that I'm making this sound bigger than just the cancellation of a TV show.

I have been less than thrilled with most of these, but I've enjoyed one or two. Angela's Ashes is one of his better works, but it adapts a book which< I would argue, can not be properly adapted. This is a very pure, almost sterile, adaptation of the original memoir Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt. It chronicles vignettes in the family history of the McCourt's, a poor Irish Catholic family struggling to survive in early 20th century Ireland. The film, like the book, is stark, painful, hopeful, powerful, and deftly accurate. More than a period piece, this film works as a dramatic rendering of social history.Unlike the book, this film depicts Frank's childhood from a disembodied third person perspective, though it is liberally complemented by an effective voice-over narrative drawn almost directly from McCourt's own prose. Frank is the oldest of several siblings (many of whom never reach adulthood), in a family suffering from poverty, alcoholism, and persecution. Although the film has many positive messages, like the lives of the McCourt's, it's not an easy road. Those who wish to be simply entertained should probably not bother.The performances are all exquisite. Kudos to the cast and the director for making them all look so great. Visually, the film is stunning for its starkness and powerful use of contrast. The pace is a little breathless at times, but, given the richness of the original work, this is appropriate.All considered, this is a very worthy representation of the book. The only quibble I have stems from the very act of translating what was a very intensely personal, first-person memoir into a third-person medium like film, not from anything the production team did, or from the script and cast. It would likely have been impossible in a mainstream film to depict the texture and poetics of McCourt's prose to the extent that viewers would really feel that they had grown up with him and knew him like a member of their own family. This is how the book made me feel, and seeing the movie after the book I was reminded of the feeling, but not quite so powerfully affected. I would agree that reading the book first will help you enjoy this film, however, I also believe that this stands well on its own.
