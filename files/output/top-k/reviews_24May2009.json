It was almost artistic in a way. I doubt many people will understand this film or enjoy it at all, some horror fans may not like it either probably preferring something more dilute like Scream or other Hollywood crap. This film will probably disturb you in a way and probably won't leave you feeling like it was a happy ending, or you might not even understand the ending at all. Lucio Fulci was a bit of pessimist in this is reflected in this film.Another thing is this film is cruel, its really brutal how people get killed and very painful. Not that it's hard to watch, it just that its plain brutal. This film isn't just gore and brutality though, its pretty scary and keeps you on your seat a little bit in suspense. You always feel an atmosphere of dread and just know that a certain character is going to get it. The death scenes won't disappoint gore lovers. And we have a lot of Fulci's trademark eye gouging scenes. We even get to see tarantulas take a guy's eye out! Almost all the characters who die get their eye gouged out in some way. The sound effects are pretty gross sounding and fairly realistic. The music is sort of synthesized and is decent, when it plays you kind of suspect something bad is going to happen pretty soon. The acting is spot on and very strong. The actors and actresses really do a great job and its pretty realistic acting. The setting too is pretty scary and really enjoyable. The story isn't too hard to follow, its mostly the things which are left out that makes you think. Somewhat there is a nod to Lovecraft I think in this film with the book of Eibon. The ending too will leave you guessing, in a good way for true fans.I think everybody who truly gets it, will enjoy this movie. I doubt most people will like it and most people nowadays are too watered down with PG-13 horror movies and their romantic comedies. This is R rated, gore with substance, though the story is a bit simple it's implications are pretty complex. If you don't like this one then you don't like Fulci! Just a wonderful masterpiece.

The eccentricities, humour, endearing English decorum and copious cups of tea are dominant themes throughout the main plot, which simply is an evil scientist trying to impose his despotic will on the world by controlling the weather. The scenes are beautifully shot, they are well structured and compliment the various characters as they are introduced. Ralph Fiennes is more than capable as Steed, as is Connery as Sir August, although I felt Connery lacked a little depth in some scenes perhaps due to the thinness of the script at these points, but I would have expected Connery's talents to have compensated. Uma Thurman was a great surprise for me. My reservations about her abilities to fill the role of Emma Peel soon disappeared. She was able to master an English accent as well as the poise and witty elegance of expression, giving all the charm and sassiness of Mrs. Peel with ease. Throughout there are some marvelous absurdities introduced into the plot, the 'Teddy Bears' being most notable. Again remember the original series. These are aspects that made the series highly entertaining. They are refreshing absurdities, pure escapism. All in all, well thought out, well shot, fun and a truly beautiful homage.

After reading Queen of the Damned, the book written by Anne Rice, I was so ecstatic to be finally seeing the movie. But as the movie progressed, that ecstasy that I felt for the book turned into disappointment for this movie.BOOK vs MOVIE As we all know, whenever books are made into movies, most of those movies, are nothing like what they're supposed to be and this one is the same with them. It's really really different from the book. Its plot wasn't copied, I think that they just used the book for names and such. And also, the book is a masterpiece, compiled and put together by one of the smartest being on earth. If you were turned off by this movie and opted to not read the book, then you are so missing a very great chapter in your life!STORYLINE It was bogus. Anybody could make that up. A story where the main lead (ML) was lonely needed somebody, found that special someone (SS), said bogus line, but was caught in the net of someone, not quite beautiful but more of a s*** (S), if you know what I mean. Then S is bad who wants SS to die by the hands of ML who turns back on S. LOOOONG story short, SS and ML live happily ever 'till death do them part, which is unlikely since we ALL know that they live forever. EFFECTS I was expecting more, since hello, DUH!!! These are the Warner Bros. we're talking about! I mean a year before they made the greatest movie ever! Harry Potter with very, VERY awe-inspiring effects. Then we just get crappy burning effects and decomposing, audiences doubled in the concert arena and don't forget the flying and jumping and grabbing hold of their so-called victims. Oh wait, that last part when the spirit inside Akasha went out and it was like doing the atom-like movements around her, it was almost okay, almost that is.CHARACTERS If you are particular to the vampire world, authors would usually say that they are the most beautiful creature that roam the world, that wherever they go if not concealed turns heads around, not literal of course, but the only person who was beautiful was Lestat aka Stuart Townsend. Jesse (M. Moreau) was beautiful too, just that she was better looking when she was still alive and not in her vampiric state. I don't know what to make of their acting since I do not really know on how to judge it, but one thing's for sure, Stuart Townsend is the best looking vampire actor in the world who beats Edward(Rob Pattinson) hands down! And Townsend is better at acting too.TOTAL All in all, if you're intrigued, I'd rather you just watch it online, no need to get out of your house to go out and rent it for you're just wasting your time. But, as I've said before if you're interested about the whole queen rising up again and rocker vamp next to her, go and look for the book, it's worth it and there are tons of lessons to learn from this book. OTHER COMMENT I wish that they'd make another movie out of this. They'll follow the real sequence that was in the book, find more people who are pleasing to the eyes to play the parts of the vampire people. And that they use Townsend again to play as Lestat with his cool and angelic voice that sounds demonic which doesn't make sense but if you listen to him you'll understand.

LOOOONG story short, SS and ML live happily ever 'till death do them part, which is unlikely since we ALL know that they live forever. EFFECTS I was expecting more, since hello, DUH!!! These are the Warner Bros. we're talking about! I mean a year before they made the greatest movie ever! Harry Potter with very, VERY awe-inspiring effects. Then we just get crappy burning effects and decomposing, audiences doubled in the concert arena and don't forget the flying and jumping and grabbing hold of their so-called victims. Oh wait, that last part when the spirit inside Akasha went out and it was like doing the atom-like movements around her, it was almost okay, almost that is.CHARACTERS If you are particular to the vampire world, authors would usually say that they are the most beautiful creature that roam the world, that wherever they go if not concealed turns heads around, not literal of course, but the only person who was beautiful was Lestat aka Stuart Townsend. Jesse (M. Moreau) was beautiful too, just that she was better looking when she was still alive and not in her vampiric state. I don't know what to make of their acting since I do not really know on how to judge it, but one thing's for sure, Stuart Townsend is the best looking vampire actor in the world who beats Edward(Rob Pattinson) hands down! And Townsend is better at acting too.TOTAL All in all, if you're intrigued, I'd rather you just watch it online, no need to get out of your house to go out and rent it for you're just wasting your time. But, as I've said before if you're interested about the whole queen rising up again and rocker vamp next to her, go and look for the book, it's worth it and there are tons of lessons to learn from this book. OTHER COMMENT I wish that they'd make another movie out of this. They'll follow the real sequence that was in the book, find more people who are pleasing to the eyes to play the parts of the vampire people. And that they use Townsend again to play as Lestat with his cool and angelic voice that sounds demonic which doesn't make sense but if you listen to him you'll understand.

It's interesting how in the middle of a conversation people can just start singing a song. 3.

The Jets and Sharks decide to have a war counsel after the dance at Doc's Candy Shop. Tony comes to see Maria after the dance and sing goodnight to her. The two gangs set a day and time for the rumble that will take place. Within the next couple days, the rumble takes place under the highway. Things don't go as planned and the rumble ends in despair. Tony is running from Chino because he is out to kill him. What happens in the end is for you to find out. 4. I really liked all the music used in this film. There was a lot of hype and suspense at different types when the music would change. I think the characters voices were projected very well in the different scenes. I think the different settings were perfect for the parts that they were played in. The effects also kept you on edge because at times you didn't know what was going to happen next. The scenes in the film matched very well with what was happening at the time. 5. At times I thought there was a little too much singing.

There was also a quite a bit of dancing for it to be a movie and not a musical. Some of the effects at times were a little confusing and didn't really stand out as much as they should have. 6.

In this respect it's not so much a 'western' as a human morality play set in the west. The dramas we are presented with could be placed almost anywhere.Paul Newman plays the titular 'Hombre'. His is a role that's perfectly suited to his screen persona. He's a half-breed Indian taking a ride on the stage-coach. None of the other decent white folks want to sit next to him so he's relegated to the outside. But he doesn't care. He doesn't appear to care about anything. To him; bigotry isn't new. Like a war-vet, he's seen just about everything in terms of human suffering, cruelty, greed, selfishness, and duplicity. Nobody ever gave him or any other Indian an even break. So he gives none. He's not only a man's man; he's a masculist, yielding no more to female sensibilities than those of males. He looks out for himself, and knows how to. Straightforward, uncomplicated, laconic.The Hombre has inherited a guest house from his father. He means to close and sell it. He serves immediate notice on its comely proprietress, who evidently had other ideas. There's no ceremony, no latitude; it's his. He wants shut of the place, so she's out; that's it. Her presumption of womanly whiles count for nothing.Richard Boone does what he does best, playing a bad guy. There's a wonderful scene where he terrorises a passenger into surrendering his coach-ticket. He was going to start on the Hombre, but this passenger intercedes and gets bullied instead. Our Hombre does nothing. He never asked this man to speak on his behalf.During the journey, they are ambushed. The bandits are Boone's men. He knows exactly who on the coach has got what. One of the passengers is an Indian agent. He's been swindling the red-skins blind and carries a bag full of money that are both his proceeds and the bandits' particular interest.

The pace and length of the movie are perfectly matched, confronting us with human issues only in sufficient depth to make us think, without labouring any preconceived morality. We make of it what we will. The script is excellent, with plenty of spiteful, sarcastic and well-observed repartee. There are not enough thought-provoking movies like this. Aldrich's 'Flight Of The Phoenix' is one, in which the Hombre is played by a German aircraft engineer. Hitchcock's 'Lifeboat' is another.Highly recommended.

One of the passengers is an Indian agent. He's been swindling the red-skins blind and carries a bag full of money that are both his proceeds and the bandits' particular interest. Their ambush goes awry. With the passengers abandoned to effectively die of thirst; the Hombre kills one of the bandits, recovering some water and the money. The others stampede.Now the passengers must walk. He knows where he's going. The others can follow or not, as they please. The despised is now the master. He's an Indian, and a wilderness survivor, all too familiar with privation. The white folks are not. They're civilised. Boone and his bandits haven't given up on the agent's stash.Although Newman has this movie by the throat, there are no bad performances at all. It's a small group of character actors each giving an excellent turn. Settings are well chosen. All the technical elements are up to snuff. The pace and length of the movie are perfectly matched, confronting us with human issues only in sufficient depth to make us think, without labouring any preconceived morality. We make of it what we will. The script is excellent, with plenty of spiteful, sarcastic and well-observed repartee. There are not enough thought-provoking movies like this. Aldrich's 'Flight Of The Phoenix' is one, in which the Hombre is played by a German aircraft engineer. Hitchcock's 'Lifeboat' is another.Highly recommended. I am tempted to call it a classic, though not necessarily a classic 'western'. Maybe that's why it's not so popular. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ","genre":"Western"},{"date":"24 May 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Sometimes, these low budget '80s horror films catch audiences by surprise. People assume because of their low budgets, un-well known actors and fairly unknown directors that they're going to be bad. This, and so many other cult films from the 1980s prove this theory wrong. With a budget of less than a million, director Stuart Gordon pulls of a competent, well acted and written, funny, occasionally scary, and always entertaining flick. This one will be remembered years from now, and over 20 years after it's release, it still has a large cult following!Dr. Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs) has created a new serum that if injected into the brain after death, will bring the dead back to life. West ends up renting a room from fellow doctor Daniel Cain (Bruce Abbott) and Daniel's girlfriend Megan (Barbara Crampton). Daniel ends up finding about West's serum after a mishap with their cat, and soon they end up testing it at the morgue. This ends in a reanimation with terrifying results, and the realization that bringing humans back to life does not mean that they will be the same as before they died.Really, this movie cannot be classified as horror. It has a spooky setting, and the occasional jump scene, but more than anything this is a comedy. The main character, Herbert West, is an accumulation of clich√©s from every other mad scientist in the horror genre. The action scenes are so over the top, they're hilarious. This movie is purposefully funnier than it is scary, and this is really a comedy. It can be compared to another cult classic that came out a few years later, Evil Dead 2, in it's morbid slapstick humor.The actors are all convincing. Jeffrey Combs is quite good at being menacing while doing nothing...he's rather creepy in the role. Bruce Abbott seems like an everyman, and plays it well. He's the underdog hero. Barbara Crampton is a nice love interest for him, and David Gale portrays an interesting semi-dead villain.Some of the best scenes, are the most ridiculous. The actors give a deadpan serious performance as silliness ensues, and where it could make it seem like these are good actors in a crummy movie, it instead feels like a tongue in cheek horror film. In one scene a zombie cat attacks, and it's clearly a cheap puppet, but these guys play it off like this is one frightening little feline. Another scene involves a decapitated body's large intestine flying out and choking a character while the rest of the body parts jump up and down. It's so ridiculous, but also so perfect.This comedy horror film is likely to entertain. It has memorable characters, slapstick violence, and for all you lovers of the human body, a lot of full frontal nudity from both sexes. To go along with the film we have a very lush musical score by Richard Band, the man behind the amazing music from the not so amazing Troll. In the end, this is an entertaining film with enough gore to please fans of the macabre.My rating *** 1\/2 out of ****. 87 mins. R for strong violence, sexuality, and nudity.

I know I gave up on this one easier than other people, and for me, the second time, not remembering who did do it, I still gave up on the guessing game. But there is more here than that, by far. Just start watching as a start. Very smartly staged and photographed (LaShelle, masterfully), and with strong, clean performances, mostly from the demurring detective played by Dana Andrews (better known for his performance in The Best Years of Our Lives), watching is easy. The long scene two thirds through, where Andrews is alone in the posh apartment brooding, considering, puzzling, and possibly falling further in love with the dead Gene Tierney of the title role, is a little masterpiece of careful, restrained movie-making. As if to confirm his feelings (and really make the movie perk up), this is where he has a glass of whiskey, falls asleep, and wakes to see Laura standing there like a mirage or an angel. Or a mistake. Laura, the supposedly dead main character we had seen only in flashbacks. From here it takes us on a circuitous wrapping up and we sort of know what will happen, though still don't know how to guess who may have done it.There might be some issues of confusion not intended--a plot this precise and interwoven begs for nitpicking. Watch the final big party scene with all the suspects gathered, where Andrews accuses, implicitly, Laura herself. Does she panic? No. If she wants us to think she did it (killed the model in her clothes), wouldn't she worry that she would go down by mistake? Isn't the electric chair a lot to risk?

Did I miss something about the second clock (there is an exact match somewhere)?

The Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962 escalated, climaxed and then reached its resolution so rapidly that the Doomsday Clock didn't even have time to adjust its setting, but, nonetheless, it is perhaps the closest we've ever been to destroying ourselves for good. Prior to watching Roger Donaldson's taut historical thriller 'Thirteen Days (2000),' I knew very little detail about the Cuban Missile Crisis, but was familiar with its effects on popular culture. Two years afterwards, Sidney Lumet and Stanley Kubrick independently released two similar Cold War thrillers &#x96; 'Fail-Safe (1964)' and the satirical 'Dr. Strangelove (1964),' respectively &#x96; both of which clearly attempted to reproduce the mortal political situation in which young President John F. Kennedy then found himself (and both films proposed that next time we may not be so lucky).'Thirteen Days' gives life to events that would otherwise, to a belated onlooker like myself, have seemed mere historical footnotes on paper. Only by returning to the proper time and place can one truly appreciate the despair and uncertainty faced, not only by the political leaders holding eleventh-hour meetings in the White House, but also the stunned citizens who would stock up on supplies in preparation for what must have seemed the inevitable. A historical drama like 'All the President's Men (1976)' is magnificent precisely because it succeeds in spite of a foregone conclusion, and 'Thirteen Days' similarly keeps the atmosphere exhilaratingly tense. Most of the film's action unfolds in the stuffy board-rooms and elaborately-decorated rooms of the White House, and this is where it should have stayed. Unfortunately, Donaldson too regularly cuts away from the primary decision-makers to visit American jet pilots, navy boat captains, and even the Cuban missile-workers, thus only partly representing the Presidents' continual frustration at having so little information on which to base his decisions.The story itself revolves around Special Assistant to the President Kenny O'Donnell (played by Kevin Costner with a dubious Bostonian accent), and so presenting the Crisis from the perspective of a reasonably passive, impartial spectator. Bruce Greenwood (most recently spotted in the Bob Dylan biopic 'I'm Not There (2007)') is excellent as JFK, whose (relative) youthfulness is consistently scorned by the reactionary military commanders who seem intent on undermining his authority. Steven Culp, who has a little Brad Dourif about him, is also outstanding as Robert F. Kennedy, without whose matter-of-fact input his brother could never arguably have got along. Unjustly neglected on its original release, 'Thirteen Days' is a fascinating, and often terrifying, historical account of the Cold War's most dangerous fortnight of hostilities &#x96; hostilities not necessarily characterised by gunfire or missile strikes, but by the threat of something so much more widespread and devastating. In making his strategic decisions, President Kennedy walked a tightrope above the threat of nuclear war, and we can only be thankful that he kept his balance.

Most of the film's action unfolds in the stuffy board-rooms and elaborately-decorated rooms of the White House, and this is where it should have stayed. Unfortunately, Donaldson too regularly cuts away from the primary decision-makers to visit American jet pilots, navy boat captains, and even the Cuban missile-workers, thus only partly representing the Presidents' continual frustration at having so little information on which to base his decisions.The story itself revolves around Special Assistant to the President Kenny O'Donnell (played by Kevin Costner with a dubious Bostonian accent), and so presenting the Crisis from the perspective of a reasonably passive, impartial spectator. Bruce Greenwood (most recently spotted in the Bob Dylan biopic 'I'm Not There (2007)') is excellent as JFK, whose (relative) youthfulness is consistently scorned by the reactionary military commanders who seem intent on undermining his authority. Steven Culp, who has a little Brad Dourif about him, is also outstanding as Robert F. Kennedy, without whose matter-of-fact input his brother could never arguably have got along. Unjustly neglected on its original release, 'Thirteen Days' is a fascinating, and often terrifying, historical account of the Cold War's most dangerous fortnight of hostilities &#x96; hostilities not necessarily characterised by gunfire or missile strikes, but by the threat of something so much more widespread and devastating. In making his strategic decisions, President Kennedy walked a tightrope above the threat of nuclear war, and we can only be thankful that he kept his balance.

The Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962 escalated, climaxed and then reached its resolution so rapidly that the Doomsday Clock didn't even have time to adjust its setting, but, nonetheless, it is perhaps the closest we've ever been to destroying ourselves for good. Prior to watching Roger Donaldson's taut historical thriller 'Thirteen Days (2000),' I knew very little detail about the Cuban Missile Crisis, but was familiar with its effects on popular culture. Two years afterwards, Sidney Lumet and Stanley Kubrick independently released two similar Cold War thrillers &#x96; 'Fail-Safe (1964)' and the satirical 'Dr. Strangelove (1964),' respectively &#x96; both of which clearly attempted to reproduce the mortal political situation in which young President John F. Kennedy then found himself (and both films proposed that next time we may not be so lucky).'Thirteen Days' gives life to events that would otherwise, to a belated onlooker like myself, have seemed mere historical footnotes on paper.

Somehow, over the years, I had missed seeing it, but knew of it.The movie is a major disappointment. Badly directed, with cartoonish performances, horrible special effects (yes, even for 1988) and an overbearing soundtrack, the whole thing plays like a Lifetime movie as channeled through an 80s Spielberg wanna-be. The presentation of 1962 small town America is apparently intentionally meant to be a clich√© to the extreme, but to what end? The style lends a comic, sit-com atmosphere throughout the film, that fights against any horror elements present in the script.The outcome is telegraphed so blatantly, that it would be impossible to imagine that anyone cannot immediately figure out who the killer is.If this movie is meant for children in the five-to-ten age range, it is offset by surprising violence and profanity. Of course, in the 80s, it was a trend to throw these elements into the mix of a 'family film, especially in those related to Amblin, or its copycats.Overall, a laughable, cringe-inducing viewing experience, not recommended for young children or discerning adults.
