However there are only so many ways you can show the world going to buggery before it gets a bit samey. Twelve Monkeys however is a future dystopia movie that mostly sidesteps looking at said dystopia, and instead twists through time to reveal where things went wrong in the first place.Although sometimes thought of as a non-linear movie, Twelve Monkeys in fact follows the personal timeline of its hero as he zips back and forth, and in broad outline is not actually amazingly complex. However, the David and Janet Peoples screenplay does not make any clear opening statements &#x96; apart from a couple of lines on a title card which are put in dubious context. We then plunge straight into the flowing narrative and have to glean what the movie's about in bits and pieces along the way. While this demands close attention from the viewer, it works very well to embroil us in the world of a confused outsider.This confusion and oddity is deepened in the approach of director Terry Gilliam, who uses rather overt stylisation to make the world of Twelve Monkeys as distorted and alien as possible. His near-constant Dutch angles and claustrophobic camera positions (racked up or toned down depending on protagonist Cole's mental state) could easily become tiresome, but the focus on macabre set design, unusual faces and familiar objects made to look outlandish allows us to get swept up in the wonkiness of the whole creation. At times, watching it feels a bit like being unpleasantly drunk. But don't let this fool you into thinking there isn't precision to all this. Knowing that the story often relies upon the audience recalling some tiny detail, Gilliam uses a number of cunning tricks to fix something in our memories, for example Madeleine Stowe's distorted voice on the words Merry Christmas or the fact that Dr Peters has those distinctive ginger locks.As Gilliam garnered his reputation as a belligerent maverick, he also began to work with more and more prestigious Hollywood stars. Twelve Monkeys sees Bruce Willis in a role that is arguably to his type, with a fair bit of macho action, but with a presentation that is very much counter to his usual confident demeanour. He's actually very effective in this lonely, vulnerable guise, seeming mysterious yet sympathetic. The most memorable turn is that of an exuberant Brad Pitt. Pitt's madman act is derived mostly from the hammy madman acts of Jack Nicholson and Dennis Hopper, and it's really just as overdone, although there is some amazingly complicated business he's doing with his fingers that is at the very least distinctive. Gilliam seems to have achieved the impossible and make Pitt look, not unattractive as such, but disappointingly plain. Madeleine Stowe gives a strong and steady performance, a credible turn in what is really the only straight dramatic role. Her best highlight &#x96; and the most poignant moment in the whole picture &#x96; is that ghost of a smile in her final scene.While Twelve Monkeys in many areas falls some way short of perfection, it works better than many movies with stronger components, simply because good or bad everything is of a piece. Pitt's overacting, Gilliam's extrovert camera, the improbable converging of events in the storyline, these all fit in with the strange and giddy rhythm of the movie and its grim yet oddly sentimental mood. It is far from the typical sci-fi fare that gets the geeks salivating, but it is an absorbing thriller and one that, even through its unreality, carries a striking humanity.

I saw this movie in theatres when I was about 11, and remember coming out of the theatre&#x85; more than disappointed. A few years ago I saw the movie again in a film class, and found it just as horrible.A.I. explores the topic every movie about a robot explores&#x97;what if they had feelings? A topic, I might add, that I never understood because the point of making a robot is it can do lots of hard work without getting physically or emotionally hurt. Anyway, I digress. A.I. takes place at some unnamed year in the future, and a robot manufacturer is talking about a new proto-type, a child robot that can feel love for its parents. They decide to try out this proto-type David on an employee and his wife whose young son has died and is cryogenically frozen. David is played by Haley Joel Osment. It must be said that the only reason this movie is ever tolerable is Osment's performance. He manages to portray a robotic yet loving child, something that can't be easy to do. However, even a brilliant actor cannot save a horrible script.After a short adjustment period David develops a cute, loving, bordering on creepy relationship with Mommy. Things are going great until couple's organic son Martin is defrosted and brought home. Despite the fact her real child is alive again, Mommy can't bear to part with David. However, Martin is a cruel little SOB who makes it his mission to get rid of David. At Martin's birthday party he and his friends are preoccupied with stabbing David and checking if he is anatomically correct, so David clings to Martin for protection. They both fall into the swimming pool and David is accused of&#x85;attempted murder (?). The father then says that he must go. Mommy cannot deal with her mecha child being disassembled, so she does the most humane thing she can think of&#x97;abandoning him in the woods with the knowledge that the only person who loves him is gone forever! With only a vamped up Teddy Rupskin for company, David gets picked up by a robot-hating redneck group. He is put in a sort of monster truck rally where the goal is to destroy robots in the most creative ways possible. While there David meets Gigolo Joe played by Jude law, who is no more than a walking, talking sex toy. Because of David's unique programming he begs for his life, making everyone believe he is a real child. They release him and Gigolo Joe together, and David's new mission is to find the blue fairy from Pinocchio in hopes she will turn him into a real boy and Mommy will want him again. Joe then tells David they must go on a lengthy trip to a computer professor. After a lengthy trip to the online professor (which David has to pay for), it tells him the location of the blue fairy. It gives him the location of a blue fairy statue in NYC, which is now under water. Joe and David take the trip to a very damp NY. While in NY there are a few scenes that feel like they are supposed to be meaningful and insightful into the mind, but are just wildly confusing. They are so confusing I can't even explain them properly. Anyway, David and his talking teddy go down in a submarine and sit in front of the statue for TWO THOUSAND YEARS! Then, aliens come! Through more confusing plot points they recreate David's Mommy in some strange attempt to understand humans, which have since gone extinct. It is then to be believed that David turned into a real boy and died happily with Mommy. This movie makes no sense, has so many plot holes it's ridiculous, gets indescribably confusing at the end, and is PAINFULLY long and boring. First of all, the fact that a child robot created for sad, childless adults being an 11-12 year old boy is ridiculous. If this ever happened, David would be much younger. In fact, in the short story this movie is based on David is three years old, but much more mature. Oddly enough, in the movie David is on the cusp of puberty but behaves like a pre-schooler, giving him the air of someone mentally challenged. There is NO point in the role of Gigolo Joe. He brings next to nothing to the plot, aside from a few bad sex jokes. And for some reason, NO ONE in this movie tells David that the blue fairy is MAKE BELIEVE. Despite the fact he has a computer chip for a brain, Joe is does not tell him this or any other useful information. The concept of the trip to this computer professor wastes so much time and makes very little sense. If this movie were made in the 70's, 80's or even early 90's it might. BUT, this movie was made in 2001. There were already several search engines like Yahoo! up and running. Surely they could predict this futuristic society would have something much more advanced, free, and accessible at any location. As for the aliens&#x85;whoever wrote this script must have given up or handed it off to someone else at the last minute. It is absolutely Godawful. There is nothing good or entertaining about this movie, and the only slightly redeeming quality is that it stars Haley Joel in his prime.

At home she has to deal with a very strange and quite possibly disturbed mother. Because of this she has no confidence and has nothing good to say about herself. This all changes slightly when she's invited to the prom by one of the (more) popular boys. Carrie discovers she has the power of telekinesis; the power to move or influence objects with the mind. It seems to trigger whenever she's in stress, is angry or is confused. Things are building up when one of the girls in Carrie's class is denied entry to the prom, and she blames Carrie for it...---After watching this just now, I have to say... wow. Just wow. This movie is truly amazing. The movie has a fantastic build-up and it's great to see so many elements in this story come together, for good or worse. I was on the edge of my seat for the 2nd half.The acting is perfect. Sissy Spacek as Carrie steals the show. She portraits her role as a confused, scared young woman with much power and emotion. Piper Laurie as Carrie's mother is another amazing role in this movie. None of the other characters look bad; they all play their roles just fine.Another thing I'd like to point out what's good about this movie is the music. Very fitting, strong (and also very unnerving) music that plays throughout the movie.I'd recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys dramatic stories.

Why? Because no one can ever kill them! However, Night of the Creeps (1986) is one of those zombie movies that stand out from all the others. I went into this movie not expecting anything for a couple reasons I didn't know any of the actors, I had no idea what the plot involved and because I was bored one night and had nothing else better to do than to watch this film. My whole perspective was changed when the film had ended. Nothing beats this film when it comes to lovable characters and very unique special effects.There are four main characters to this film. Jason Lively and Steve Marshall star as two college students, Chris Romero and J.C. Hooper, who are only trying to fit in with their surroundings. Marshall's character, J.C., has polio but makes up for it by having a witty personality. Lively's character, Chris, has no disabilities but is very shy and timid when it comes to doing anything that's beyond his comfort zone. Playing Chris' love interest, Cynthia, is played by the college hot pocket, Jill Whitlow. Whitlow plays her role really well and although her character is not supposed to be seductive, if you watch her eyes they can mesmerize any male viewer in the audience (at least I think). Last but not least is Ray Cameron played by Tom Atkins for which the story line is based upon. His background will be explained in the beginning of the film and then will be brought up again later to fill in some questions the audience might have. Most zombie movies are not supposed to be funny but they can sound like they are intended to be. This film though, is supposed to be funny. Much of the dialog will make the audience giggle and chuckle. Much of the comedic parts are between different characters not just a specific one (though most come from J.C.). Now I'm not saying it's a comedy. It still has plenty of horror on screen for all you horror fans. The music for this movie was composed by Barry DeVorzon. DeVorzon does a great job in changing from scene to scene. The science-fiction part has an eerie feel to it. When the camera's focused on more of the human qualities, for example when Cynthia asks Chris to a formal (which is one of my favorite scenes), the tone of the music is sweet and innocent. What I like the most about this film is the science-fiction\/horror aspect. In the beginning of this film the audience is introduced to an alien who's trying to get rid of something that we don't know of at first. Just the aliens themselves are cool to watch. They look like the Ewoks from Star Wars Episode VI Return of the Jedi (1983) without the fur. Once the movie gets going, the audience gets to witness the alien slugs (if that's what they are). I love the way they move, and I love sounds that they make when they're scuttling on the ground; it gives them a very icky, sticky, slimy feel. I also love the part of the film that builds up to the climax. I can't say much here but I think being paired up with your girlfriend\/boyfriend with a shotgun\/flame-thrower, fighting off zombies together is the sexiest date! Props to Fred Dekker for this funny horror fest!Considered to be director Fred Dekker's best work, Night of the Creeps has an attractive appeal that will not only deliver chuckles but also the creeps (as stated in the title). The actors work great together and the special effects are really something to admire.

Instead I'd probably sitting here giving it 2 or 3 stars and telling you about all the things I really didn't like about it. But as weeks and months passed by I couldn't get The Wicker Man out of my head, and I started to realise that actually it was a pretty incredible and rare horror film, that focuses its attention on unsettling imagery rather than cheap gory kills. Watching it again recently for the second time only confirms my new beliefs that The Wicker Man is a masterpiece and a well-deserved classic.It's a slow burner with an extremely, increasingly intriguing mystery surrounding a missing girl. From the minute Edward Woodward steps onto the island it's obvious that something isn't right with these people, and they're hiding something, though you're not entirely sure why. It's a film about encounters really, that don't make any sense, and are so unnatural that they turn out to actually be quite frightening. The Wicker Man has a very imaginative and solid screenplay, that clearly has had a lot of thought being put into it, with its creepy religious symbolism and ultimately shocking finale.Edward Woodward is the only normal man we see throughout the whole film, and like Shutter Island he can't leave, and so their is a great atmosphere of claustrophobia and also a coldness from the awe-inspiring scenery. The songs are also unsettling, if not a bit overlong, they seem to be cheery and well-practised, just something very unnatural about it all. The Wicker Man also has some fantastic iconic moments, not just the final scene, but throughout their seems to be moments that will always stay with you.Christopher Lee does a find job, also dawning an hilarious wig resembling a mild Patsy from Absolutely Fabulous. He also has some classic lines and will probably be one of the most memorable characters of all time. In my opinion The Wicker Man was way ahead of its time, and the ending is no exception. When we meet The Wicker Man a sheet of sheer terror certainly does cover you. It is monstrously creepy, and will probably stay with me for as long as live.

You might not appreciate the first time, but as time goes on, you won't be able to put away that image of The Wicker Man which ultimately leads up to what probably is the best twist and finale to any film in history.

The phantom is suspended between worlds after a curse was put on him by his ex-wife . When a sympathetic trainer named Steve Walker (Dean Jones) arrives in the coastal little town called Godolphin he attends a charity sale and buys an antique bed warmer. After that , Steve discovers a hidden spell and after reading it out aloud he conjures up the title character and he only can see the fantastic pirate , being one important trouble , no one will believe him . The only way to break the curse is to do a good act for once in his life . As the notorious pirate is a ghost who has to prevent his descendants from becoming a gambling casino . Meanwhile , an ancient hotel run by some old ladies called ¨Daughters of Buccaneers¨( Elsa Lanchester and others ) of Godolphin little town is under threat of foreclosure from nasty gambling mobster who wishes to construite a house game on the location . As the coach Steve and the gorgeous Jo Anne (Suzanne Pleshette ) help protect his descendants' home from being taken over by racketeers who want to make it casino , both of whom along with the 400-year-old ghost romp around in the motel threatened with closure.This slapstick fantasy Disney is plenty of adventure , imagination , comedy ad lots of fun .

After a recent viewing on TCM, I'm thinking that it was about how three different men look at and are attracted to a beautiful woman, or perhaps even how Arthur Miller was seeing his wife at the time. Three men attracted to the same woman for three different reasons. For Clark Gable, the crusty old cowboy, this recently divorced woman played by Marilyn Monroe was seen as the child that he wanted to father after a wasted life in which he 'lost' his real children. For Montgomery Clift the Monroe character has become the mother who turned cold on her little boy, a boy unable to grow up, and the Clift character finds her sensitivity to him becoming the mother who has abandoned him. Eli Wallach on the other hand is entranced by the pure sexuality of the young divorcée, a sexuality that had been missing in his deceased wife and that he has lived without for all the years since her death. Could it be that the writer of the screenplay has been seeing his wife in all three ways? John Huston's direction and the photography are flawless, but not so with the Monroe character as it is written and how it is played. It's too much of a stretch for me to see a glamorous woman, who danced in nightclubs, attends to the details of making up her face, and dressing as sexily as she does would be a woman to dance in the field and hugs trees. I find the inconsistency too much to swallow. The other players are real and believable, but because of the way it was written, or a need to showcase the sex goddess the way viewer have been seeing her, it became for me the one major flaw in what I'd expect to be a great picture given the credentials of all involved, including the music of Alex North.

Coming out of it, I got that performance but I also got a wrenching exploration into addiction and what it takes to be a man. The script by Sidney Carroll and Robert Rossen is structured expertly, opening and closing with big games of pool, but traversing through a sea of despair and character development in between them. The opening game gets everything off to such a rapid start, with this fast and wickedly entertaining face-off between Fast Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) and Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason) that lasts over a day long. It plays out for practically the entire first half hour of the film, and that half hour flies by as a pace as swift as the two men moving around the pool table.That game hooked me in quickly, but The Hustler isn't concerned with being a sports movie by any means; it's about taking this character, brash and headstrong, and stripping away everything he's got in order to find out what he's truly made of. It's after the match is over though that the film really sinks it's teeth in and takes off dramatically. Eddie begins a relationship with the lonely Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie) that will change his life drastically and ultimately change who he is. George C. Scott marvelously plays Bert Gordon, the all-knowing man who backs Fats in the beginning, and he tells Felson that in order to win he needs to develop character. Well, that's exactly what he does.I've always loved films where the central character changes immensely from the beginning to the end, while the world around them stays the same, and The Hustler is a shining example of that structure. When we first meet Felson he is cocksure, stubborn and overly confident. By the end he is a completely changed man and Paul Newman portrays him with a brilliance that few actors have ever been able to accomplish. To go through these remarkable changes takes something great and Newman breathes every scene so strongly, trading on his natural charm and charisma to bring down the house when the film makes it's way into it's surprisingly dark and poignant themes.He's not the only member of the cast who shines, all four of the core actors pull off great work here. Piper Laure is devastating as Sarah, a character who we initially think Eddie needs but as more is revealed we discover that it's her that needs him. She's a ball of alcoholic rage and haunting loneliness and when the film ended she was the only who left the most resounding impression on me, despite it being Newman's show all the way. George C. Scott has an incredibly commanding presence, and Jackie Gleason makes enough of an impression in those opening thirty minutes to keep you thinking about him the entire film until he comes back in the final, wickedly intense showdown.The Hustler ended up being something much different than I was expecting, and something much more real and powerful. Paul Newman's revelatory performance took a deeply flawed and human character and tossed him through the ringer, leaving a mighty impression as the lights faded out.

Men in Black 2 was a disappointment back then, and it's still significantly weaker than the first one. Let's start with the positives, I like the villain, Serleena, sure, she's no giant bug in an Edgar-suit and is way more serious and just not funny, but safe to say, she is a whole lot sexier, and I liked her sort of vine-like, worm form. Johnny Knoxville is also a villain here, a two-headed moron henchman, he's actually pretty good, but he's hardly in it, and he just disappears completely at one point, with no explanation given, he's just gone, seems the director forgot all about him. The movie tries a lot of stuff, has numerous aliens and situations, and much of it, like the creatures in the locker, doesn't work at all. The worms are back, and I hate them, they are obnoxious, loud and unfunny, but, they are nowhere near as annoying a Frank, sorry, I can't stand this character, he was only in the first movie for a few, brief minutes, here, he's J's new partner for way longer than I would've wanted, he talks and talks and talks, and nothing of what he says is even marginally funny. But of course K returns, and the chemistry feels a little off, Smith and Jones are still good, but something felt a little strange, I think the script or inspired ad-libbing just wasn't there when they made the movie. The special effects are pretty good, although a few moments have jarring mistakes, like Jeff breaking out from the ground and knocks J to the side, then the next shot, he's completely gone. Rosario Dawson is no Linda Fiorentino, she's just there, nothing funny to do, she definitely is significant to the plot, but I didn't care about her character. David Cross is very funny and gets the most laughs in his brief appearance, Patrick Warburton is fun as well and the subway sequence is excellent. I wish the final battle was, you know, exciting or awesome, but it isn't. Men in Black 2 is not a good sequel, it has some entertaining parts, but the movie is a disappointment, I hope the third movie will rekindle the franchise and be worthy of the original.

Rodgers and Hammerstein knew how to write musicals, and all of their works, even the lesser ones, are at least interesting.I don't know what happened in the transition, but this movie is an over-produced, bloated, dreadfully photographed (the color palette is just awful) piece of work, clumsily assembled and poorly cast. Mitzi Gaynor is way too young-looking for the role of Nellie Forbush, and lacks the star power that Mary Martin brought to the role on the stage. Rossano Brazzi and John Kerr are okay, but WHY did Hollywood insist on casting actors in musicals who could not do their own singing? At least Gaynor does her own vocals; Brazzi and Kerr are both dubbed, and so, inexplicably, is Juanita Hall as Bloody Mary. Hall was more than capable of singing the role herself she created the character on Broadway, but for some reason the filmmakers decided to use Muriel Smith's voice, throwing all credibility out the window because Muriel Smith's singing and Juanita Hall's talking did not bear the SLIGHTEST resemblance to each other.About the best thing I can say about this film is that the show is presented pretty much intact (the made-for-TV remake, while improving on some things, inexplicably excised the song Happy Talk on the grounds that it was too politically incorrect. Oh please.). But of all the R&H shows, this one needed singing actors; it did not, for the most part, get them, and even one player who could sing was saddled with a bad overdub job. Thankfully, Ray Walston as Billis gets to do his own vocals, but that character is the one role in the show that does not require a great voice.Plus the thing goes on too long (some cuts run almost three hours); an egregious fault that one would not have expected from Logan, who should have had a better sense of pace than is shown here.I have seen regional theatre productions of this show that put the film to shame.

But when Alistair refuses to move the piano his remote home, Ada takes an instant dislike to the shy man.

While in both of them, Meryl gave her best shot, the director's approach towards the actress is very different. In Out of Africa, Meryl's character Karen is a hardworking, independent, strong-willed young baroness\/plantation worker later author, while in The Iron Lady, she oscillates between an eighty year old dementia-suffering Thatcher and a middle-aged Thatcher, both authoritative.While I do understand Phyllida's attempt to have Meryl foreshadow others to show Thatcher's dominance, the movie itself became a one-woman show that barely gave a s*** about the supporting cast. While in Out of Africa, Pollock never resorts to showy camera work to highlight Meryl. The camera moves through the picturesque Africa and the beautiful Meryl so naturally as if the cameraman was lost in the beauty of the entire place. While Meryl is a marvel, Pollock himself is a wise man who gave the picture an independent existence. The Iron Lady will always remain Meryl's Iron Lady.Based on a true story, Out of Africa shows Karen Blixen's life as she adjusts to the African lifestyle while romancing Denys (Redford) and divorcing Bror (Klaus). The opening itself talks of the farm at the foot of the Ngong Hills and is voiced by Streep in a very distinctive accent. Many of her performances, especially the ones where she uses accents, are slightly difficult to accept first but shine later, even though she does sound like Sly Stallone at times, especially when she says in one scene I want you to COME HOME. Karen marries Bror to retain her title of baroness and moves to Africa. Bror uses her money against her wishes and doesn't take care of her properly. Karen meets Denys and another guy, and invites them to her home. Both the guys are attracted to her but things go awry for one. Denys and Karen fall in love but Denys lives a very different life, independent like Karen but in a nomadic way. Karen runs the entire farm, opens up a school and acquaints and adjusts herself with the Africans.Pollack has handled the movie tactfully, and the film is enriched by fine performances. The green verdant lands of Africa with the pastoral huts of the Africans on one hand and the lavishness of the Britishers on the other can be seen. There is this lovely scene where the tribe chief tells Karen that only tall children will go to school. When Karen tells him that sending kids would be very wise of him, the African replies that the Britishers have learned to read, but it has not helped them in any way. Still, the farmers hold respect for Karen's caring nature.Clocking at 2 hours and 40 minutes, Out of Africa is like a landscape of a beautiful bird on its mighty flight over the flowing rivers and the dense forests.

Denys and Karen fall in love but Denys lives a very different life, independent like Karen but in a nomadic way. Karen runs the entire farm, opens up a school and acquaints and adjusts herself with the Africans.Pollack has handled the movie tactfully, and the film is enriched by fine performances. The green verdant lands of Africa with the pastoral huts of the Africans on one hand and the lavishness of the Britishers on the other can be seen. There is this lovely scene where the tribe chief tells Karen that only tall children will go to school. When Karen tells him that sending kids would be very wise of him, the African replies that the Britishers have learned to read, but it has not helped them in any way. Still, the farmers hold respect for Karen's caring nature.Clocking at 2 hours and 40 minutes, Out of Africa is like a landscape of a beautiful bird on its mighty flight over the flowing rivers and the dense forests.
