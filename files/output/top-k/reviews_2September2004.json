Seeing as THREADS was set in the Yorkshire town of Sheffield and filmed on a budget of what appeared to be three dollars fifty cents you'd think he'd use some of his unquestionable talent and VOLCANO's $90 million budget to make a convincing scenario of a city devastated by events beyond its control But Jackson has been there , done that , bought the T-Shirt and written his name in broadcasting history with THREADS and the last thing he wants is to make another grim shocker where millions of city dwellers die . Picking the dumbest script imaginable Jackson has decided he's going to enjoy himself this time and filmed the complete opposite to his nuclear holocaust horror show . Remember in THREADS a myriad of scientific advisers were used ? It goes without saying that no scientific bodies were consulted in the making of VOLCANO .

That was probably the most terrifying thing about the docu-drama , of having your throat cut for your meager supplies of food .

Here the laws of physics have been changed so that if anyone is trapped under a burning truck a passer by can magically lift up the truck with one hand thereby rescuing the injured party .

It seems to me that if you believe in their situation and have immersed yourself in the film, as it was easy for me to do, then you don't even notice them after a while. I would argue that the cast (in terms of dialogue) in Private Ryan is far more of a problem, since these seem to be 1990s guys transported back to 1944 and are far too 'knowing'. Moreover, in Private Ryan I kept stepping back from the film feeling that I was simply being manipulated by the director. COI is far more chilling. I really liked (if that's the word) a scene where an artillery explosion killed both Germans and Soviets. Kind of emphasises the 'war is hell' message without preaching or being manipulative. I think Steiner is one of the greatest military characters ever to appear on film (for what its worth, Gregory Peck as Savage in Twelve O'Clock High, and Jeff Daniels as Chamberlain in Gettysburg are also up there). I must say I didn't really like the ending, but I can't suggest a better one, but as an alternate ending I would certainly recommend that people *do not* see the awful sequel 'Sergeant Steiner' with Richard Burton(!) as Steiner.

By the Fifties, era of The Feminine Mystique, the best we could do were Monroe and Audrey Hepburn. Both were in the running for the lead in Blake Edwards's utterly specious romcom.Monroe, the wiggling, busty airhead blonde with too much sex, the middlebrow's Jayne Mansfield. Audrey the skinny, simpering, self-dramatising brunette with not enough sex, Julia Roberts with a touch of class. Compare Tiffany's with Pretty Woman the style is the difference between East and West Coasts, but like Roberts Hepburn appeals to other women, not red-blooded men. Both she and Monroe played gold-diggers who adore diamonds-- Marilyn hymned them in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes-- but Holly Golightly is far too much of a lady to, er, do anything in return for her mysteriously comfy, workless existence in New York City. Or if she does, we are not given a hint. Throughout her short career Hepburn played girl-women (whose sophistication did not extend to the boudoir) kept by sugar daddies, or an untouchable virgin princess, or a young widow, or a trainee nun. Full-blooded relationships with men of her own age were outside her range. In this late role, she is given the tics schoolgirls adopt to make themselves interesting. She has a nameless cat, a long fag-holder, wears dark specs in murky bars and does a little mild shoplifting anything to be thought kooky. Improbably, Holly is also a teen runaway from the sort of Southern place where your uncle is your first husband, but they needn't have bothered, since Hepburn does not bother with any sort of American accent half the time. Capote was scratching for inspiration in Breakfast at Tiffany's, a short novel published in 1958 after he had exhausted his meagre experience in his first two. It's an obvious rip-off of Christopher Isherwood's Sally Bowles both feature queer writers in a strange town who take up, sexlessly, with insecure, pretentious semi-prosties. Like Sally, Holly says dahling and divine a lot and latches on to rich suckers.If anything, the filmic Paul Varjak's sources of income are more mysterious. Holly sports almost as many costume changes as Lana Turner, while Paul keeps his end up with a parade of natty suits and jackets like Joe Gillis in Sunset Boulevard. Is Patricia O'Neal paying? In the finale the two impoverished waifs sport matching rainwear.The movie was produced just before permissiveness struck, and boy does it show not only in the central evasion about how our heroes support themselves, but in such details as Holly's party (broken up by the cops although it's milder by far than De Mille would have shot in the 1920s) and a visit to a strip club where no garments are shed. When Audrey croaks through Moon River you can hear why Marni Nixon had to dub her in My Fair Lady.If Tiffany's gets remade more accurately, I suggest Julia Roberts as star she should manage the southern child-bride side after Pretty Woman, that other monument to Hollywood's dishonesty about prostitution. And after Aspects of Love and Sunset Boulevard, Andrew Lloyd Webber could wreak more overblown musical tedium out of Capote's last work of the imagination before he took to writing up killers and society gossip.

By the Fifties, era of The Feminine Mystique, the best we could do were Monroe and Audrey Hepburn. Both were in the running for the lead in Blake Edwards's utterly specious romcom.Monroe, the wiggling, busty airhead blonde with too much sex, the middlebrow's Jayne Mansfield. Audrey the skinny, simpering, self-dramatising brunette with not enough sex, Julia Roberts with a touch of class. Compare Tiffany's with Pretty Woman the style is the difference between East and West Coasts, but like Roberts Hepburn appeals to other women, not red-blooded men. Both she and Monroe played gold-diggers who adore diamonds-- Marilyn hymned them in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes-- but Holly Golightly is far too much of a lady to, er, do anything in return for her mysteriously comfy, workless existence in New York City. Or if she does, we are not given a hint. Throughout her short career Hepburn played girl-women (whose sophistication did not extend to the boudoir) kept by sugar daddies, or an untouchable virgin princess, or a young widow, or a trainee nun. Full-blooded relationships with men of her own age were outside her range. In this late role, she is given the tics schoolgirls adopt to make themselves interesting. She has a nameless cat, a long fag-holder, wears dark specs in murky bars and does a little mild shoplifting anything to be thought kooky. Improbably, Holly is also a teen runaway from the sort of Southern place where your uncle is your first husband, but they needn't have bothered, since Hepburn does not bother with any sort of American accent half the time. Capote was scratching for inspiration in Breakfast at Tiffany's, a short novel published in 1958 after he had exhausted his meagre experience in his first two. It's an obvious rip-off of Christopher Isherwood's Sally Bowles both feature queer writers in a strange town who take up, sexlessly, with insecure, pretentious semi-prosties. Like Sally, Holly says dahling and divine a lot and latches on to rich suckers.If anything, the filmic Paul Varjak's sources of income are more mysterious. Holly sports almost as many costume changes as Lana Turner, while Paul keeps his end up with a parade of natty suits and jackets like Joe Gillis in Sunset Boulevard. Is Patricia O'Neal paying?

I don't think it would be made today. It was expensive and there were no women in it to speak of, and any committee member with an MBA reading the script would wonder why there wasn't more action. Further, the movie hasn't got any magnificent computerized graphics going for it. And we hardly see any blood. And nobody's head gets blown apart. And there's not a foul word in it.David Lean has pulled off a neat stunt, making a superb film with a good script, great performances, effective location shooting, a subtext that provokes thought, a marvelously believable set of characterizations -- and no gimmicks.It begins traditionally enough, with red mud and brilliant green foliage, and an authentic prisoner of war camp into which Nicholson's captured battalion marches proudly. The first real hint we get of the film's originality is when the men are marching in place to Colonel Bogey's march and we get one or two shots of feet stomping up and down on the wet gravel. One pair of feet wears only half shoes. The toes are pointing out of the right shoe. On the left shoe, the upper has separated from the sole, and it flaps up and down as the foot inside it drives into the earth. Not only is the shot THERE but it's lingered over, just long enough.William Holden is running through the bushes, trying to escape from the camp, disturbing flocks of bird that chirp madly at him. One of his Japanese pursuers shoots him and he tumbles into a turbulent river. In any Hollywood movie, the drop would be done by a stunt man in the usual manner -- head over heels, arms flailing, off the cliff. Not here. Holden falls feet first, hands and palms held out at his sides, as if expecting to land on a trampoline. He simply doesn't FALL like a professional.The film is loaded with grace notes like this. It's difficult to imagine a director willing to take the time to fine tune his film like this today because both the people making films and the viewers themselves are impatient to get on with the story and reach the next scene that has sex, blood, or comedy in it. I wonder if it's coincidental that people now categorize themselves as fans of one or another basketball team instead of a baseball team. Watching a baseball game calls for patience while the batter digs his cleated shoes into the dirt around the plate. Basketball is all momentum and no patience is required.I won't go on about the movie except to say that it's masterly in almost every respect. But I guess I will mention one more thing of the sort that impressed me, dealing with characterization. Throughout the movie, we've been told and shown that Nicholson cares for nothing so much as the bridge itself. He began by thinking of it as a way to keep up the men's morale and a reason for keeping discipline, but it has come to have functional autonomy, eclipsing everything else in importance. Note the way Guiness's eyes light up in the day-for-night scene when he's told that similar bridges built of English elms have lasted for three hundred years. Three hundred years!, he marvels.Likewise, the supporting character of Joyce, on the commandos, is shown as being uncertain of whether he could use his knife in hand to hand combat or not. When an armed Japanese soldier appears at arm's length, Joyce freezes and Jack Hawkins dashes in to kill the man. These two traits -- Nicholson's obsession with the bridge and Joyce's inability to use a knife -- are set up so that the final (and only) confrontation between Nicholson and Joyce can take place the way it does. Nicholson screams, Blow up the BRIDGE?, grabs Joyce's legs and pulls him down to the sand, preventing Joyce from reaching the detonator. Commandoes be damned, nobody is going to destroy his bridge. Hawkins and Holden shout from the opposite bank of the river, urging Joyce to kill him! But Joyce can't kill him without using a knife, which we know he will be unable to do.It's a perfect payoff for what we've learned about the two men.Did Nicholson deliberately throw himself on the detonator as he was dying or did he fall on it by accident? Who cares. If he did it deliberately it would be a heroic act since he finally came to his senses. But an accident would be more in keeping with the ironic tone of the rest of the film. At the end, everyone and everything of importance is dead except Clipton the humanitarian doctor who tells us unnecessarily that this is madness -- and those floating vultures with their Olympian view of these goings-on.It's a gripping movie from beginning to end, a magnificent job by everyone involved.

That scene alone makes you wonder if the war in general was pure madness Kilgore becomes more concerned about surfing than doing his job.For those who are still avoiding seeing this version of a classic, put your fears to rest and rent it tonight.

Following a lecture in San Francisco,  Helen is attacked and nearly killed by creepy psychopath  (Harry Connick Jr., in a gem of a performance). A year later, Helen, horribly traumatized by the incident, offers her services to the SFPD to find a serial killer who is copying the murders of the Boston Strangler. Inspector  M.J. Monahan  (Holly Hunter) and her partner Reuben Goetz (Dermot Mulroney) work with Helen, who has not left her penthouse since her attack.`Vertigo-style' beginning are risky even for the most talented director; after all even Hitchcock's `Vertigo' was an initial failure, and director Jon Amiel  is certainly no Hitchcock. He's not even a Clint Eastwood, who usual choice of low-key lighting would have been much more appropriate. I can't believe first-rate cinematographer Laslo Kovacs choose the gaudy visual style of `Copycat'. The killer is revealed halflway through the movie, turning it from a mystery into a `cat and mouse' thriller and Weaver is not vulnerable enough to make that good a mouse. Will Patton's sweaty, suspicious performance leads me to believe the producers couldn't decide whether they wanted a mystery or a cat and mouse thriller and decided halfway through production which way to go. Worse, Holly Hunter and Dermot Mulroney barely register. Mulroney is bland, but I think that's what they wanted given his fate. However, the southern-accented Hunter seems badly out of place in San Francisco.WARNING SPOILERSWeaver should have come off that bathroom floor and cut psycho William McNamara's throat with the broken glass. That would have been a nice, nasty touch and would have been mush more believable than her stabbing his upper thigh (funny, I don't remember McNamara limping after that) . Also, we could have dispensed with that unbelievable scene of Hunter rescuing Weaver after Hunter has been shot twice in the chest at close range with a 9mm.`Copycat' is not quite as stupid or badly acted as `Striking Distance,' but it's not a whole lot better either. I give `Copycat' a `5,' and SOMEBODY give Harry Connick, Jr. more work!
