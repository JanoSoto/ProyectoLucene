Sad thing is, it's the latter that eventually takes over completely.The movie stars Kevin Costner (who until now had never been in a bad sports movie) as Billy Chapel, a 40 year-old pitcher who's game has seen better days. He's close to retirement and as the movie opens he has set an elegant dinner for his girlfriend who never shows. Even worse (and these things just conveniently happen on the same day) he has been traded and the team has been sold.I might have been genuinely interested in the story of an over-the-hill pitcher and his struggle to hold onto the talent that he once had and that alone is what drew me to the movie. But director Sam Raimi hammers together a tired old love story complete with all the nuts and bolts that no bad love story is ever without.There is the obligatory scene in which the two meet-cute in an unusual place (by the roadside when her car breaks down). She doesn't know who he is and knows virtually nothing about baseball (would it be too much to ask the screenwriters if the hero could fall for a sports nut?). The fall madly in love before she loses confidence in him and a huge misunderstanding leads to one of those big emotional scenes in which it looks like she will leave him forever to take a job overseas. Does she? I guarantee that you have seen this movie before and know the outcome.The movie is a surprise to me. Costner has starred in plenty of bad movies but until this movie he has never starred in a bad sports movie especially baseball after gems like 'Bull Durham' and 'Field of Dreams'. He's made his mark as box office poison in the sci-fi genre but I hope this doesn't mean that that reputation is moving over to the sports movie arena.I'm also surprised that this movie comes from Sam Raimi. In 1998 he made the hard-edged 'A Simple Plan', the story of three men who find $4,000,000 in a plane crash and struggle to keep it a secret which leads to distrust and tragedy. That movie was about human nature and never for once did we anticipate where it was going.There are two scenes in 'For Love of the Game' in which Costner is on the mound and is able to block out everything around him by 'Focusing on the mechanism'. Perhaps that logic should have been applied to the screenplay.

It is a style in the cinema that can be described as dark, depressing and twisted. In the film noir world, the cops are crooked, the women are devious and the hero is a man who can't seem to understand anything that is being investigated. By the end of this long-lasting journey through intrigue and mystery, you will find the truth and the truth will or can be deceiving.Enter J.J. Gittes. Gittes (Jack Nicholson), is a hard-working private eye, who's specializes in eavesdropping on cheating wives and husbands. His job consists of dropping onto a conversation between the cheating wife or husband and snapping photographs of the two of them together. One day, Gittes finds out that a client wants him to take pictures of her cheating husband. The husband is a chief engineer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Learning that he is building a reservoir and that people are opposing his construction of the reservoir, Gittes decides to follow the chief engineer around, taking photographs of him and his adulterous lover. Now, you might think I am telling the first half of the story. Well, I am. The reason why is because the story of Chinatown is a lot twisted than you think.After Gittes finds out about the cheating husband, he soon finds out that the woman he met in his office is not the same woman he met before. Enter the second character of the story, Evelyn Mulwray, (Faye Dunaway). She is the actual wife of the chief engineer. But, who was the client that was in Gittes' office? Anyway, Gittes continues his investigation and winds up having his nose cut from a punk, (Roman Polanski), and having to find out that water is the main clue of the murder. But, wait a minute.... The chief engineer is in control of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Why would someone kill him? The story deepens as Gittes meets up with Noah Cross, (John Huston), during his investigation. Now, there are two people involved in this mystery. More clues start to pop up. And Gittes? Well, he's in way over his head. I guess the truth is going to be hard to get to.Chinatown is in the great tradition of the film-noir movies of the 1940's. In fact, the story takes place in 1937 Los Angeles. Director Roman Polanski creates a very dark and disturbing underworld where sometimes the truth can lead to dangerous circumstances. The set direction and costume design are very well done and builds a certain amount of authenticity as both a period picture and as a film noir movie. The way Los Angeles is portrayed as a city of mystery is great because there is so much going on in this metropolis that we, as the audience, are caught between two ongoing problems the water issue and Gittes' investigation.Jack Nicholson is perhaps, one of the best and most hard-working actors of our time. He creates, what I think, one of his best and most memorable performances in his career. He portrays Jake Gittes as both a man and a detective, who understands something about bad luck since he been to that place. Here, his presence makes the film works because he can't seem to penetrate this strange and mixed up world that seems different to us since he can't understand everything he's given. The more he feeds himself into this world, the more knowledge he will gained. Every time he gets closer to the clues, he ends up having to be drawn back to himself. One scene that proves this point is when Gittes' nose is cut by Polanski. Every step is dangerous, according to Gittes.I also enjoy and really admired the performances by Dunaway and Huston. Dunaway is stunning as Mulwray, creating a character, who at first, isn't pleased by Gittes' joke, but soon comes to terms and becomes Gittes' helper as she begins to explore the underworld with him. Together, you might think that there's a chemistry between the two, but really, these two characters are somehow locked up in this underworld, where everything is not what is seems to be, according to the characters. John Huston is very convincing as Noah Cross, a man who's questions are startling to Gittes since he is crossing that invisible line between discovery and the truth. In one scene, he advised Jake, You don't what you're dealing with. You just don'tRobert Towne's screenplay for the movie is a captivating script that is filled with authentic dialogue, which illustrates the world of 1937 Los Angeles and also creates sharp conversations between all of the characters. There are a lot of great well-written and well-spoken lines in Chinatown that can be dared to be said. I wish more storytellers can tell more stories like this one. It is also equivalent to a great book, one that you can't simply put down. I have had that feeling while watching Chinatown. I just couldn't stop watching and for the most of the time, I was more focused on every bit of detail and aspect that this movie had to offer. The first time you might not understand everything that is being done. But, when you see it the second time around, you will understand how everything falls into place. In fact, maybe we can learn something about the littlest details, like water. ★★★★ 4 stars.

Even though it centres around a very talented pool player, it is far from a run-of-the-mill sports film. Paul Newman portrays 'Fast' Eddie Felson in the performance of his lifetime. Eddie is a small-time pool hustler who travels far to play the reigning straight pool champion Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason) and he's prepared to risk everything. In the process, he develops a relationship with the booze-addled girl Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie). They have a 'contract of depravity'. Rich bookie Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) tries to eliminate Piper to get the maximum out of Eddie. In the shattering climax, Eddie realises that he has been playing the wrong game, with the dramatic results that follow.One notion that makes The Hustler such a great film is its brilliant acting. The classic supporting cast members (Laurie, Scott, Gleason, McCormick), three of which received Oscar nominations, is original in that every character is unique in its portrayal. The powerful Scott, sitting in the dark cigarette-smoked poolroom, is the source of evil throughout the movie. Gleason's performance is equally brilliant due to its subtleness, Fats barely has any lines, but plays a magical part with his movement, his dancing around the pool table. However, Paul Newman tops them all. Gordon tells Eddie he's a born loser, and we eventually know that this has little to do with the pool game. Eddie is a handsome, talented man but he's self-destructive and can't seem to come to terms with the dark world in which he lives, and this dramatic irony is omnipresent. He gives (indeed, donates) us a subtle but equally powerful performance, which perhaps only Brando could have pulled off. When Eddie finally leaves the poolroom, he and Fats conclude the film with the utterly great words Fat man, you shoot a great game of pool. so do you, Fast Eddie.Indeed, this movie's energy and enigma is largely due to the choice for black and white. As the slightly disappointing sequel by the great Scorsese proves, it just isn't the same in colour (despite the Academy Award for Newman). The shadowy, mysterious aura that hangs over the pool room creates such a magical atmosphere, in which everything could happen.

He deals with this loss by going back to Poland and rebuilding himself.The first I noticed when going through this film was how light it all felt, all the weight that I felt on the director's previous film, Blue, were mostly lifted. I wasn't so much disappointed with the change in tone as there are many moments in this film where the plot and narrative benefited from it, but I was underwhelmed by Kieslowski's execution. The director couldn't seem to make me feel comprehensively invested to the protagonist, as I personally felt he wasn't explored enough and the intentions of the character wasn't truly clear to me throughout. Thankfully I enjoyed the journey that the protagonist has taken, as we get to see him start off on the bottom of the world, figuratively speaking of course, and building himself up slowly to becoming a respectable and fulfilled man. He doesn't reach this stage without playing dirty of course, Karol is still a normal human being and would do whatever he can in order to get ahead, but it was handled in such a way that we don't think less of him. I saw this rebuilding as just a constructive coping mechanism towards the tragic loss he just suffered, and I think in a way all of what he has made for himself was all for her or at least something to prove to her. During the film's third act, we can see that he is still in pain and even though he could get anything he wants there is still a void in him that hasn't been filled, and that is love. It was her love that he has always wanted, and he blames himself for not being able to show and prove that to her during their marriage. For Karol, content doesn't come from wealth, respect and fame, it comes from Dominique.The film's photography was also a major change from the first film of the trilogy. Colors seem to be warmer, and the color seems to dominate a lot of the film's images, possibly enforcing the idea of purity and beauty. It connects really well with the film's plot and narrative, making certain situations coming off as comically charged rather than dire, giving us a glimpse of how the film would feel during its resolution. The score also was change from the previous film, switching from the grand and dramatic tone to something much lighter and sharper. I found the score to be effective, particularly during the moments where the film wants us to feel sorry for Karol or when he examines or thinks about his one true love, Dominique. We are able to understand his fascination with her, and the music helps support that.Zbigniew Zamachowski plays the film's protagonist, Karol. He was wonderful in the role, though it wasn't at the same level of amazing as Binoche in Blue. The actor was able to manipulate my feelings towards the character, with one moment feeling highly sorry then the next moment feeling proud of what he has become. He was able to change the appearance of his exterior while keeping his internal qualities the same. Julie Delpy was also pretty good in the role, but it would have been better if she was given a bit more screen time; then again this is Karol's story, not hers.White may not be a step up as I hoped it would be from Blue, but it's still a great piece of work from Kieslowski. Hopefully Red would be at least just as good as this, if not better.

The director couldn't seem to make me feel comprehensively invested to the protagonist, as I personally felt he wasn't explored enough and the intentions of the character wasn't truly clear to me throughout. Thankfully I enjoyed the journey that the protagonist has taken, as we get to see him start off on the bottom of the world, figuratively speaking of course, and building himself up slowly to becoming a respectable and fulfilled man. He doesn't reach this stage without playing dirty of course, Karol is still a normal human being and would do whatever he can in order to get ahead, but it was handled in such a way that we don't think less of him. I saw this rebuilding as just a constructive coping mechanism towards the tragic loss he just suffered, and I think in a way all of what he has made for himself was all for her or at least something to prove to her. During the film's third act, we can see that he is still in pain and even though he could get anything he wants there is still a void in him that hasn't been filled, and that is love. It was her love that he has always wanted, and he blames himself for not being able to show and prove that to her during their marriage. For Karol, content doesn't come from wealth, respect and fame, it comes from Dominique.The film's photography was also a major change from the first film of the trilogy. Colors seem to be warmer, and the color seems to dominate a lot of the film's images, possibly enforcing the idea of purity and beauty. It connects really well with the film's plot and narrative, making certain situations coming off as comically charged rather than dire, giving us a glimpse of how the film would feel during its resolution. The score also was change from the previous film, switching from the grand and dramatic tone to something much lighter and sharper. I found the score to be effective, particularly during the moments where the film wants us to feel sorry for Karol or when he examines or thinks about his one true love, Dominique. We are able to understand his fascination with her, and the music helps support that.Zbigniew Zamachowski plays the film's protagonist, Karol. He was wonderful in the role, though it wasn't at the same level of amazing as Binoche in Blue. The actor was able to manipulate my feelings towards the character, with one moment feeling highly sorry then the next moment feeling proud of what he has become. He was able to change the appearance of his exterior while keeping his internal qualities the same. Julie Delpy was also pretty good in the role, but it would have been better if she was given a bit more screen time; then again this is Karol's story, not hers.White may not be a step up as I hoped it would be from Blue, but it's still a great piece of work from Kieslowski. Hopefully Red would be at least just as good as this, if not better.

I was waiting in eager anticipation for the opportunity to see it on the big screen and finally that opportunity arose. My expectations were decently high because any time anyone talks about this film they refer to it as though it is a movie changing experience. It is exactly that. On the surface level as sheer entertainment, it is good. But when you look at that importance of the film, what they accomplished and what it meant you begin to see the true greatness of this classic. I watch a lot of classic film especially in the last couple of years and as great as most of them are a lot of them don't hold up well over time. Bonnie and Clyde holds up so well and never once feels dated. In fact, because it pioneered something in its style, visceral and nearly shocking content, it could have easily been made today and still shock some. It is the most twisted romance you could ever seen. The heart of the film really is this bizarre relationship between Bonnie and Clyde. Everything else is the backdrop. The gritty scenery of the deep South, the wild and unhinged behaviour and the detail they touch on when creating Bonnie and Clyde doesn't go unnoticed. It feels real, it feels shocking and it feels downright disturbing. Its such a sad and twisted story and you are right there to witness all of it. Never once did I feel compassion for them. I never felt they were being painted as heroes but rather tragic figures of history.Warren Beatty fits this role just like a glove. He becomes Clyde Barrow. It isn't even the type of role that is in your face or bowls you over but its a subtle performance and its the little things about it that makes you realize by the end how brilliant it is. Beatty's facial expressions, the limp, the look in his eyes...he just completely lets this role pour out of him and its obvious why its iconic. Faye Dunaway is the iconic Bonnie Parker. Dunaway is fantastic in the role and actually brings the character to life in a very similar way to Beatty. The beauty of it is though the chemistry between the two of them. Its twisted and disturbing and yet you almost understand this fatal attraction. They try and touch on some of the more important aspects of their relationship but there is so much story here. Both of them absolutely deserve the classic status their performances have gotten. Without either of them this would have been a very different (and probably not as effective) film. Michael J. Pollard, the amazing Gene Hackman, and Estelle Parsons all bring their various characters to life in different ways. Parsons is excruciatingly irritating exactly like she is meant to be (a portrayal the real Blanche didn't care for.) Hackman and Beatty are sizzling opposite each other as the killer Barrow boys. Pollard could have used some more depth to his character but its a vital role and he does it well. Denver Pyle is decent but painfully predictable as the tough old Texas Marshal who finally gets his vengeance against Bonnie and Clyde.Haunting, beautiful, disturbing and shocking, this film leaves nothing to the imagination. The first time a man is shot in the face and it still feels shocking so imagine what it was like then. Director Arthur Penn obviously cared very much for this film and the historical aspect. There are so many urban legends about the two infamous killers and bank robbers and the film tries to at least scratch the surface of some of those rumours which isn't easy to do. It is likely one of those films that by sheer magic\/miracle or fate everything clicks about it. The chemistry, the script, the cinematography, the cast...everything feels iconic. It wasn't perfect for me. I thought sometimes it dragged just a little bit and we do see a lot of the same material again and again because of the nature of the story. They were bank robbers and they hid from the law. That's not to say I was bored for even a moment. This is true gangster flick glory so if you like that style...Bonnie and Clyde is the epitome of that. It is an absolute must see and I will be adding it to my personal collection. Over time I think I will only learn to appreciate it more. 8.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 June 2014","score":"","review":" To be honest, I stayed away from Bonnie and Clyde on purpose for years.

Beatty's facial expressions, the limp, the look in his eyes...he just completely lets this role pour out of him and its obvious why its iconic. Faye Dunaway is the iconic Bonnie Parker. Dunaway is fantastic in the role and actually brings the character to life in a very similar way to Beatty. The beauty of it is though the chemistry between the two of them. Its twisted and disturbing and yet you almost understand this fatal attraction. They try and touch on some of the more important aspects of their relationship but there is so much story here. Both of them absolutely deserve the classic status their performances have gotten. Without either of them this would have been a very different (and probably not as effective) film. Michael J. Pollard, the amazing Gene Hackman, and Estelle Parsons all bring their various characters to life in different ways. Parsons is excruciatingly irritating exactly like she is meant to be (a portrayal the real Blanche didn't care for.) Hackman and Beatty are sizzling opposite each other as the killer Barrow boys. Pollard could have used some more depth to his character but its a vital role and he does it well. Denver Pyle is decent but painfully predictable as the tough old Texas Marshal who finally gets his vengeance against Bonnie and Clyde.Haunting, beautiful, disturbing and shocking, this film leaves nothing to the imagination. The first time a man is shot in the face and it still feels shocking so imagine what it was like then. Director Arthur Penn obviously cared very much for this film and the historical aspect. There are so many urban legends about the two infamous killers and bank robbers and the film tries to at least scratch the surface of some of those rumours which isn't easy to do. It is likely one of those films that by sheer magic\/miracle or fate everything clicks about it. The chemistry, the script, the cinematography, the cast...everything feels iconic. It wasn't perfect for me. I thought sometimes it dragged just a little bit and we do see a lot of the same material again and again because of the nature of the story. They were bank robbers and they hid from the law. That's not to say I was bored for even a moment. This is true gangster flick glory so if you like that style...Bonnie and Clyde is the epitome of that. It is an absolute must see and I will be adding it to my personal collection. Over time I think I will only learn to appreciate it more. 8.5\/10 ","genre":"Biography, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"12 June 2014","score":"","review":" To be honest, I stayed away from Bonnie and Clyde on purpose for years. I was waiting in eager anticipation for the opportunity to see it on the big screen and finally that opportunity arose. My expectations were decently high because any time anyone talks about this film they refer to it as though it is a movie changing experience. It is exactly that. On the surface level as sheer entertainment, it is good. But when you look at that importance of the film, what they accomplished and what it meant you begin to see the true greatness of this classic. I watch a lot of classic film especially in the last couple of years and as great as most of them are a lot of them don't hold up well over time. Bonnie and Clyde holds up so well and never once feels dated. In fact, because it pioneered something in its style, visceral and nearly shocking content, it could have easily been made today and still shock some. It is the most twisted romance you could ever seen. The heart of the film really is this bizarre relationship between Bonnie and Clyde. Everything else is the backdrop. The gritty scenery of the deep South, the wild and unhinged behaviour and the detail they touch on when creating Bonnie and Clyde doesn't go unnoticed. It feels real, it feels shocking and it feels downright disturbing. Its such a sad and twisted story and you are right there to witness all of it. Never once did I feel compassion for them. I never felt they were being painted as heroes but rather tragic figures of history.Warren Beatty fits this role just like a glove. He becomes Clyde Barrow.

In these times of extreme communitarian sensitivity, I'm fully aware that these questions can hide an unconscious form of anti-Semitism but I know my conscience is crystal clear on that level.Let's first put facts into their historical context, anti-Semitism is undoubtedly connected with an indelible stain on Humanity's soul called the Holocaust, six millions of Jews died of something that started with an individual belief, a devastating number in a dramatically short time span. The historical trauma made obvious the distinction between anti-Semitism and racism. Now it angers communities who protest against the supremacy given to the Jew suffering, above others from the past and the present, but as a retort, these protestations are liable to get the 'anti-Semite' stamp, making the snake biting his own tail.Now it's impossible to see where and where is not anti-Semitism, the only certitude being that its injurious effect acts on a reputation like a torpedo on a U-boat. But back then in 1947, things were a bit different. Directed by Elia Kazan, and written by Moss Hart, Gentleman's Agreement explores anti-Semitism in post-war America. Gregory Peck is Phil Green, a noble-hearted journalist assigned to write a series about anti-Semitism to see which aspects of his life he took for granted would be affected if he passed as a Jew. And boy, no matter how confident, charismatic, and well-spoken he is, the mere mention of his ethnicity carves a sign of undesirability on his front.And the time the film was made is crucial 1947. Two years after GI's discovered the extents of Nazi barbarity in Death camps and one year before the creation of the state of Israel, not without American help. What Kazan's film offers is an interesting view on America's mindset toward Jewish people bigotry, misunderstanding and defiance, remarkably contrasting with the US Foreign Policy. Basically, it's not the film that is dated, but minds. The anti-Semitism discovered by Phil is one that hasn't been confronted to its devastating effects. After all, what Nazis did, started with the way Americans thought, shocking but true.And that anti-Semitism didn't wait the Holocaust; its roots are Biblical before being cultural defiance toward people without a land, but with influence, a mix of envy and hate, an ugly feeling indeed, fueled by the certitude to belong to the right side. This is Green's subtlest discovery, there are anti-Semites and there are people guilty of silence, feeling on the safe side from the anti-Semitism they observe. To give you an example, there were three kinds of kids in the schoolyard bullies, victims and cowards who either supported the bullies or didn't help the victims, to avoid the hits. All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.And speaking of good persons doing nothing, Green finds one and falls in love with her. Dorothy McGuire is Kathy, his boss' niece, a divorced woman who actually suggested the theme of the series. Yet, despite her well-meaning intentions, as the romance grew, she betrayed in many occasions her unconscious bigotry. It started with her confused concern whether Green's Jewish or not (ruining a promising dinner) and culminated after Phil's son (played by a young Dean Stockwell) complained about kids attacking him because he said he was a Jew. She doesn't comfort him by saying that they were bad, but by him not being a Jew causing a justifiable anger from Phil.She finally closes the door after a remarkable speech that says a lot about her conception of being a Jew, it's obviously a social handicap according to her, and although she has nothing against Jews, she feels exactly like someone who's handsome, young or rich instead of ugly, old or poor. In other words, it's nothing to feel ashamed of. Phil's journey reveals the ugliest side of American narrow-mindedness, even to the point, ironic but insightful, that his Jewish secretary is part of the same conspiracy, speaking herself about 'right' and 'wrong' Jews and it's a Gentile teaching her a lesson. This is for subtleties like this that the film overcomes its self-righteous impeccability.One can also regret that the survey didn't exceed the limits of the upper-class but maybe anti-Semitism is an educated disease, which makes it much more detestable. Could there be an uglier euphemism than Gentleman's Agreement? Thankfully, Green finds some strong support from Anne, a free-spirited woman played by the Oscar-winning Celeste Holm, he finds it in Dave, John Garfield as his Jewish friend who knows too well what Phil is going through, and there is Anne Revere as his loving and caring mother. It seems that despite this great casting, Kazan and Holm didn't get along with Peck, I can see why if Peck really immersed himself into his character.And despite winning the Best Director Oscar and the film winning Best Picture, Kazan felt that the film lacked passion (indeed, Stockwell's cries said more than any Peck's speech), and that the romance was forced. Well, I think it would have damaged the film if it distracted it from its political agenda. But Green goes back to Kathy after her redemptive act showing that times have changed for the best, and making Anne Revere wishing she could live up to see how this century will evolve. But, I don't think times have changed much. Sure, anti-Semitism isn't as deep and extreme in America, but go ask the average or upper-class Americans what they think about Muslims.Sure they'll talk about terrorism and September 11th, but remember, there's no racism that doesn't start with a belief and there's no belief that doesn't start with misinterpreted facts. Finally, I stand corrected, there's nothing in Gentleman's Agreement that has lost its relevance, which is good news for the film, but sad for humanity.

The first script written by the original film's screenwriters was thrown out by Orion pictures for being too far-fetched. So the producer of the first film then contacted famed graphic novelist Frank Miller, to write the screenplay. Miller agreed, and wrote a first draft. The studio declared Miller's screenplay unfilmable, so another screenwriter was brought in to rewrite the script. Some of the main cast members from the original film reprise their roles, this includes Peter Weller as RoboCop, and Nancy Allen as Officer Anne Lewis. The film takes place about a year after the first, and things have only gotten worse for the motor city. The majority of the police force have gone on strike. Ergo, crime is at an all-time high. A new designer drug known as Nuke has made a large number of citizens become drug addicts, and an almost cult-like group, are responsible for the manufacturing and distribution of this narcotic. They're leader is a man named Cain, a dangerous individual, whose soul desire is to use the drug to create a perfect society. He will stop at nothing to achieve his ultimate goal, and will not let anyone or anything get in his way. Meanwhile, OCP has seen how despotic and destitute the city has become, and has decided to create a second RoboCop. A monstrous, super cyborg is created, and soon it grows beyond the control of OCP. Now it's up to RoboCop to destroy this evil creation, and once again protect the innocent citizens of Detroit. So how does RoboCop 2 stack up? In my opinion, pretty well. All of the things that made the original film great are still there. The violence, the satire, the humor, and the issue of RoboCop's humanity. Even though it's not explored as deeply as in the original, it's still there. Many critics complained that the use of children swearing, and being drug dealers was too mean spirited. However the sad truth is, there are children like that in this world. Besides, wouldn't you expect to see that in a city that's gone to the dogs? There were many things that were left on the cutting room floor that shouldn't have been, and perhaps Robocop 2 could've have been better that it was. All things considered however, RoboCop 2 is STILL a very good and entertaining film. The acting is great, and there's more than enough action to keep you on the edge of your seat.

","genre":"Action, Crime, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"12 June 2014","score":"","review":" After the massive success of RoboCop, a sequel was immediately rushed into production. The first script written by the original film's screenwriters was thrown out by Orion pictures for being too far-fetched. So the producer of the first film then contacted famed graphic novelist Frank Miller, to write the screenplay. Miller agreed, and wrote a first draft. The studio declared Miller's screenplay unfilmable, so another screenwriter was brought in to rewrite the script. Some of the main cast members from the original film reprise their roles, this includes Peter Weller as RoboCop, and Nancy Allen as Officer Anne Lewis. The film takes place about a year after the first, and things have only gotten worse for the motor city. The majority of the police force have gone on strike. Ergo, crime is at an all-time high. A new designer drug known as Nuke has made a large number of citizens become drug addicts, and an almost cult-like group, are responsible for the manufacturing and distribution of this narcotic. They're leader is a man named Cain, a dangerous individual, whose soul desire is to use the drug to create a perfect society. He will stop at nothing to achieve his ultimate goal, and will not let anyone or anything get in his way. Meanwhile, OCP has seen how despotic and destitute the city has become, and has decided to create a second RoboCop. A monstrous, super cyborg is created, and soon it grows beyond the control of OCP. Now it's up to RoboCop to destroy this evil creation, and once again protect the innocent citizens of Detroit. So how does RoboCop 2 stack up? In my opinion, pretty well. All of the things that made the original film great are still there. The violence, the satire, the humor, and the issue of RoboCop's humanity. Even though it's not explored as deeply as in the original, it's still there. Many critics complained that the use of children swearing, and being drug dealers was too mean spirited. However the sad truth is, there are children like that in this world. Besides, wouldn't you expect to see that in a city that's gone to the dogs? There were many things that were left on the cutting room floor that shouldn't have been, and perhaps Robocop 2 could've have been better that it was. All things considered however, RoboCop 2 is STILL a very good and entertaining film. The acting is great, and there's more than enough action to keep you on the edge of your seat. If you ask me, this film does not deserve ANY of the hatred it receives! Watch it, and decide for yourself.

Sigourney Weaver was paid $11 million to come back as Ripley, which was the entire budget of Alien ,(1979) . The ending part is particularly exciting with Sigourney Weaver battling the malicious alien and with exciting underwater scenes that took three weeks to film . The underwater segment was shot on a specially constructed sound stage on the Fox lot, which was converted into a permanent water-tank . The production had trouble finding enough studio space as major productions like Titanic (1997), Starship Troopers (1997) and Jurassic Park (1997) were all taking up most of the available studio space in Hollywood . This ¨Alien Resurrection¨ by Jean Pierre Jeunet has an extraordinary cast such as Winona Ryder , Dominique Pinon , Ron Perlman , Gary Dourdan and Michael Wincott .

Tens of thousands dead in single bombing raids, 20+ million Soviets dead, 15+ million Chinese dead, 6+ million Poles dead, 7+ million Germans dead, 11 million the victim of Nazi genocide &#x96; it just beggars belief. The European and Pacific theatres were so dreadful, so massive, that it's impossible for one to fully process it emotionally.Schindler's List is one of the finest cinematic depictions of those dark years; a sweeping, brutal film that brings a remarkable story to the attention of millions of viewers. However, as with all historical films, it does not serve as the definitive source of information.The film follows Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a Sudeten German businessman who reaped the benefits of slave labour during WWII. With his imposing presence and magnetism, he charms his way through Nazi circles, soon operating an enamelware factory in Krakow, Poland using Jewish labour. At this point Schindler appears largely indifferent to the persecution all around him, or rather he avoids confronting the ugly truth of the Nazis' approaching final solution.He eventually becomes acquainted Amon Göth, the callously evil commandant of the Płaszów concentration camp who is performed excellently by Ralph Fiennes. Göth was an incredibly violent man, the extent of his crimes were such that his sentencing was phrased as following 'Amon Göth himself killed, maimed and tortured a substantial, albeit unidentified, number of people.' Göth's violence isn't sugarcoated in the film, he shoots dozens of defenceless people and never shows even a modicum of remorse, so fanatical is his hatred for them. The film is starkly brutal, there is no cinematic sheen, the scores that are shot bleed profusely as they fall to the ground like rag dolls.Fiennes, whose face can be both that of a mild-mannered Englishman and sinister villain all at once, delivers a performance that's nuanced and restrained yet hauntingly evil. Just like an inundated office worker, Göth complains to Oskar about the pressures of the job, which at the time is the exhumation of thousands of rotting corpses &#x96; 'Can you believe this? As if I don't have enough to do they come up with this? I have to find every rag buried up here and burn it.' Like Adolf Eichmann, the logistics man responsible for the deportation of hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews, Fiennes' depiction of Amon Göth is another example of Hannah Arendt's phrase 'the banality of evil'. It is a compelling depiction of one of the Third Reich's most committed defenders; a man deeply entrenched in Nazi ideology that has lost almost all humanity.The relationship between Schindler and Göth and his SS cronies is quite uneasy for the viewer. Schindler enjoys pushing the boundaries, he thrives off being a renegade, in one scene he kisses a Jewish woman in the presence of a whole party of SS officials.As the film progresses and Schindler realises both the abhorrence of the situation and his power to do something about it, something of a good vs. evil dichotomy arises. Deriders may say this is a simplistic construct, but it isn't, they are two complex characters. Their exchanges shows that Schindler is the strongest leader between him, he has personality and charm, whereas Göth only has ruthless barbarism, something Göth realises and struggles with.The film has grand scope and several brilliant set pieces. A notable example is the 'Red girl' scene during the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto, it is very impressive logistically, there are countless extras who all need directing. Schindler, who is atop a hill witnessing the brutality below, is the camera's point of view, following this little girl in a red coat (famously one of the few moments of colour in the film) as she navigates her way through all the murder and pillaging. The scale of the scenes at the Płaszów concentration camp is also considerable, particularly as great masses of prisoners, naked and completely dehumanised, are shuffled around like cattle for inspection.Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski said that the film was shot in black and white so it would look 'timeless'. I think the colouring achieved the desired effect, and I also think the film's visceral edge and authenticity was achieved through the hand-held, shaky cinematography that would later work so well in Saving Private Ryan (1998). A great film will almost always have a great score, and it is no different with Schindler's List as Spielberg once again found a masterful auditory companion in John Williams, whose beautifully melancholy score, particularly the central violin melody, has become instantly recognisable to many people.The depiction of the mass exhumation at Chujowa Górka is set against 'Immolation (With Our Lives, We Give Life)', whose stirring operatic vocals and chords make the scene almost apocalyptic. There is also notable use of Hebrew music, such as the ebullient Yerushalaim Shel Zahav and the haunting Oyf'n Pripetshek\/Nacht Aktion. Even the trailer leaves a huge impression through music. 'Exodus', a work by the celebrated Polish composer Wojciech Kilar, has a brooding subtlety that emphasises the trailer's ambiguity, making its two minutes and twelve seconds most moving and unsettling.Despite massive universal acclaim, the film inevitably had its detractors, most notably Stanley Kubrick, who said'The Holocaust is about 6 million people who get killed. Schindler's List is about 600 who don't.'Firstly, around 1200 were saved, not 600. Kubrick suggests that 'Schindler's List' is somehow a sugar-coated account of the Holocaust, it certainly isn't. It is a true story, Oskar Schindler really did save 1200 people, it isn't a fanciful, maudlin figment of a screenwriter's imagination. It is an emotionally affecting yet tactful depiction of both the systematic murder of scores of defenceless people and a complicated man's remarkable act of humanity in the face of unimaginable suffering.97%www.hawkensian.com ","genre":null},{"date":"12 June 2014","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" WWII and The Holocaust were events of mind bending statistics and proportions.

It is an emotionally affecting yet tactful depiction of both the systematic murder of scores of defenceless people and a complicated man's remarkable act of humanity in the face of unimaginable suffering.97%www.hawkensian.com ","genre":"Biography, Drama, History"},{"date":"12 June 2014","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" WWII and The Holocaust were events of mind bending statistics and proportions. Tens of thousands dead in single bombing raids, 20+ million Soviets dead, 15+ million Chinese dead, 6+ million Poles dead, 7+ million Germans dead, 11 million the victim of Nazi genocide &#x96; it just beggars belief. The European and Pacific theatres were so dreadful, so massive, that it's impossible for one to fully process it emotionally.Schindler's List is one of the finest cinematic depictions of those dark years; a sweeping, brutal film that brings a remarkable story to the attention of millions of viewers. However, as with all historical films, it does not serve as the definitive source of information.The film follows Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a Sudeten German businessman who reaped the benefits of slave labour during WWII. With his imposing presence and magnetism, he charms his way through Nazi circles, soon operating an enamelware factory in Krakow, Poland using Jewish labour. At this point Schindler appears largely indifferent to the persecution all around him, or rather he avoids confronting the ugly truth of the Nazis' approaching final solution.He eventually becomes acquainted Amon Göth, the callously evil commandant of the Płaszów concentration camp who is performed excellently by Ralph Fiennes. Göth was an incredibly violent man, the extent of his crimes were such that his sentencing was phrased as following 'Amon Göth himself killed, maimed and tortured a substantial, albeit unidentified, number of people.' Göth's violence isn't sugarcoated in the film, he shoots dozens of defenceless people and never shows even a modicum of remorse, so fanatical is his hatred for them. The film is starkly brutal, there is no cinematic sheen, the scores that are shot bleed profusely as they fall to the ground like rag dolls.Fiennes, whose face can be both that of a mild-mannered Englishman and sinister villain all at once, delivers a performance that's nuanced and restrained yet hauntingly evil. Just like an inundated office worker, Göth complains to Oskar about the pressures of the job, which at the time is the exhumation of thousands of rotting corpses &#x96; 'Can you believe this? As if I don't have enough to do they come up with this? I have to find every rag buried up here and burn it.' Like Adolf Eichmann, the logistics man responsible for the deportation of hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews, Fiennes' depiction of Amon Göth is another example of Hannah Arendt's phrase 'the banality of evil'. It is a compelling depiction of one of the Third Reich's most committed defenders; a man deeply entrenched in Nazi ideology that has lost almost all humanity.The relationship between Schindler and Göth and his SS cronies is quite uneasy for the viewer. Schindler enjoys pushing the boundaries, he thrives off being a renegade, in one scene he kisses a Jewish woman in the presence of a whole party of SS officials.As the film progresses and Schindler realises both the abhorrence of the situation and his power to do something about it, something of a good vs. evil dichotomy arises. Deriders may say this is a simplistic construct, but it isn't, they are two complex characters. Their exchanges shows that Schindler is the strongest leader between him, he has personality and charm, whereas Göth only has ruthless barbarism, something Göth realises and struggles with.The film has grand scope and several brilliant set pieces. A notable example is the 'Red girl' scene during the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto, it is very impressive logistically, there are countless extras who all need directing. Schindler, who is atop a hill witnessing the brutality below, is the camera's point of view, following this little girl in a red coat (famously one of the few moments of colour in the film) as she navigates her way through all the murder and pillaging. The scale of the scenes at the Płaszów concentration camp is also considerable, particularly as great masses of prisoners, naked and completely dehumanised, are shuffled around like cattle for inspection.Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski said that the film was shot in black and white so it would look 'timeless'. I think the colouring achieved the desired effect, and I also think the film's visceral edge and authenticity was achieved through the hand-held, shaky cinematography that would later work so well in Saving Private Ryan (1998). A great film will almost always have a great score, and it is no different with Schindler's List as Spielberg once again found a masterful auditory companion in John Williams, whose beautifully melancholy score, particularly the central violin melody, has become instantly recognisable to many people.The depiction of the mass exhumation at Chujowa Górka is set against 'Immolation (With Our Lives, We Give Life)', whose stirring operatic vocals and chords make the scene almost apocalyptic. There is also notable use of Hebrew music, such as the ebullient Yerushalaim Shel Zahav and the haunting Oyf'n Pripetshek\/Nacht Aktion. Even the trailer leaves a huge impression through music. 'Exodus', a work by the celebrated Polish composer Wojciech Kilar, has a brooding subtlety that emphasises the trailer's ambiguity, making its two minutes and twelve seconds most moving and unsettling.Despite massive universal acclaim, the film inevitably had its detractors, most notably Stanley Kubrick, who said'The Holocaust is about 6 million people who get killed. Schindler's List is about 600 who don't.'Firstly, around 1200 were saved, not 600. Kubrick suggests that 'Schindler's List' is somehow a sugar-coated account of the Holocaust, it certainly isn't.

This may be because of the excellent performances delivered by William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare, and Oscar-winning Frances McDormand. Though the movie is very much so a drama, I found myself grinning at many comical scenes in the movie. The accents are great, Steve Buscemi is a great villain, and William H.

To get out of debt, he hires two criminals to kidnap his wife in an effort to trick his father-in-law into paying a ransom for his daughter back. The 80,000 dollars in the ransom would be split between Jerry and the two criminals.

Toward the end of Nixon's first term Larner penned 'The Candidate' as a protest and a warning that American politics was being stripped of any last vestiges of honor and ideological integrity for the sake of winning at all costs. Accordingly, 'The Candidate' follows the fortunes of Bill McKay (Robert Redford), a young, handsome civil rights lawyer and the son of former governor John J. McKay (Melvyn Douglas), who is recruited by Marvin Lucas (Peter Boyle), a shrewd political hack, to run against the seemingly unbeatable Republican incumbent, U.S. Senator Crocker Jarmon (Don Porter). Convinced that he cannot win, McKay initially uses his candidacy as a forum to air liberal issues close to his heart poverty, racism, ecological degradation, gun control, abortion rights, etc. Once it dawns on McKay that he will likely be on the wrong side of a humiliating landslide, he takes his campaign seriously and increasingly relies on Lucas to recast his image and dilute his liberalism so that he will appear more palatable to a conservative electorate. As he closes in on Jarmon in the polls, the latter requests a televised debate, during which McKay sticks to the prescribed platitudes&#x97;until the very end, when he blurts out his frustration with the contrived, irrelevant nature of the proceedings.
