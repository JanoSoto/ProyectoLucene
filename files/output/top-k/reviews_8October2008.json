The rousing martial score by Elmer Bernstein, the perfect cast of stars and stalwart supporting actors, the literate script by James Clavell, the taut direction by John Sturges... it all works together to create a seamless cinematic experience. However, it's well worth considering the realities underlying the fiction, because they can only deepen our appreciation for both. Some aspects of the film that seem improbable are easily explained; other aspects that are glossed over in the film reveal surprising additional depths.1. First, as others have pointed out, the details of the prisoners' shenanigans and of the escape -- especially the most unbelievable ones -- are absolutely true. German POW camps, largely as a result of the Geneva Convention, were a sort of world apart, with rules slanted surprisingly in favor of the prisoners. Many of their most outrageous escapades are actually omitted in the film.2. Subtly missing on screen is a sense of what camp life was really like on a day to day basis. There's no room in this fast-paced film to represent the dreadful tedium of years spent in the same wooden shack, on short rations. Years with no hope of parole, since the prisoners didn't know, as we now do, when the war might end. This helps explain their nigh-suicidal devotion to escape; these were men of action, cooped up endlessly with absolutely nothing else to do but plot to outwit their jailors.3. Also missing is a clear image of relations between prisoners and guards. By March, 1944, the Germans were living on very tight rations -- boiled potatoes and cabbage sort of stuff. Whereas the prisoners, while not exactly fat and happy, were receiving Red Cross goodies that no one in Germany had even dared dream about for years. This is hinted at, in the bribery that James Garner is able to conduct. But the dispirited state of mind of the Germans is not shown in any depth. According to multiple accounts, many guards were all too happy to collaborate with the prisoners, based on sheer economic pressure.4. On the other hand, it's not made clear just what the prisoners were up against. It's easy to get the impression that this was some sort of Hogan's Heroes resort, with the Germans oblivious to obvious conspiracies. Hardly! The 'ferrets' were guards who had the free run of the camp. They could literally pop in on any prisoner activity, at any time, any place. We see this happening once or twice in the film, but the implications aren't fully suggested. These were men with zero privacy; everything they did was subject to continuous scrutiny.5. The most obvious distortion, of course, is inclusion of Americans as major players in the escape. This was mainly a British camp and the Great Escape is fundamentally a British story. In fact, Richard Attenborough's character is the only one readily identifiable as a real person -- the amazing Roger Bushell. There's no point getting hung up on this bit of creative license; Sturges and Clavell have done a brilliant job of streamlining the story and spicing it up with star power. But in appreciating this film, we should realize which is reality and which is clever fiction.6. Finally, a word on the retribution meted out by the Germans. Yes, their treatment of the recaptured escapees was an atrocity. In fact, not mentioned in the film, it's been alleged that the order came directly from Hitler himself. On the other hand, what is not mentioned is that prior to the Great Escape prisoners had been repeatedly warned that breakouts were no longer going to be treated leniently. This is an important point. It makes the prisoners' actions even more heroic -- and also makes the Germans' apparent over-reaction more understandable (if not forgivable).What's more, even within the logic of the film, it has to be understood that these POWs really did cross the line from escapee to spy. Big X specifically says that his purpose is to set up a whole second front. By intent, therefore, this is not a mere escape; it's a calculated attempt to disrupt the German war machine, conducted by men out of uniform. That's more or less the dictionary definition of espionage, for which summary execution has long been the standard remedy. (Steve McQueen flashes his officer's bars at the end, emphasizing the point. It's a moment that I didn't understand at all the first few times I saw the film.)None of this in any way excuses the insane brutality of war -- but it does make the events depicted in this great film somewhat more comprehensible. History is more fascinating than fiction exactly because of its greater depth. The upshot being that anyone who's enjoyed the film really should seek out the book by Paul Brickhill. Not to mention other books covering the same story, such as Alan Burgess' excellent The Longest Tunnel. There's a lot more to this true story than can fit in any one film, even one as beautifully constructed as The Great Escape.

I have not been able to see the original movie and hence I cannot draw any comparisons between the original one and this one. But I guess that it is good in one way since I get to think about the movie without any prejudice at all. This movie is one of the most remarkable movies I have seen and indeed showcases Christopher Nolan as an upcoming director. Robin Williams and Jim Carrey are actors known for their comedy. And another common thing to them is that when they decide to step into roles other comedy, they produce masterpieces indeed. Robin Williams plays the role of an author of crime novels who has also killed a young girl. He has a dark and a negative role and plays a character who is very straightforward and calculative. And boy oh boy, does he manage to convince us in this role. It is one of the best roles of Robin Williams I have seen. I must confess his roles in Bicentennial Man and One Minute Photo and this role are in fact much better than his typical comedy roles. He has showcased some amazing acting skills in this movie. Al Pacino is of course among the finest actors in the whole world. And needless to say, he delivers all that is expected out of him. He plays the role of a cop with a dark secret of false methodology of conviction with Internal Affairs closing in on him. He ends up killing his partner accidentally but it turns out that his partner was going to help Internal Affairs close in on Pacino. And hence nobody is going to believe that he killed his partner accidentally. And to add to all the trouble, there is Robin Williams' character who knows this secret and is using it to get away. Pacino is the one who is suffering from Insomnia. He is in a country where there is no night and there is no peace in his mind. Have you wondered what it is like to carry a heavy mind craving for the peace of the night? Look at Pacino in this movie! Simply masterpiece acting.There is a short but very effective role by Hillary Swank as well and she does her part beautifully. She plays the role of a cop who is helping Pacino on the case. She also holds deep respect for Dormer (Pacino) since she has spent her training days studying his cases. Overall, the cast was really good. Christopher Nolan chose a very silent approach in this movie. In some parts of the movie, the overall silence creates the sort of haunting effect needed to create the impact. But the silence does not seem to work in certain scenes and may lead viewer to become disinterested.There are times in the movie where the pacing tends to get a little slower causing an occasional loss of interest.

Steven Spielberg ambitiously takes it on himself to showcase the idea of dinosaurs walking and running along with us. And my God, what a wonderful job he does! Jurassic Park is simply an amazing movie that makes us drop our jaws and look in amazement and bewilderment at the dinosaurs as they walk on the silver screen. No encyclopedia and no book can be as effective as this movie is when it comes to showing what dinosaurs were and how grand they were when they ruled the earth.The photography in the movie is outstanding. There is a scene at the beginning of the movie where we get to see the helicopter land on the heliport near a waterfall. The very beauty of the nature puts a smile on your face. And to make this shot even more wonderful, there is a wonderful music score that further broadens the smile. It puts you in a different mood altogether. And it does not fail to reproduce the magic even when you are seeing it again and again. Till today, whenever I see this one scene, it still puts a smile on my face.Finally, when you get to that part of the movie where the dinosaurs are seen for the first time, your jaws drop. You look at them in sheer amazement. You are almost convinced that somehow dinosaurs continue to exist and all the filmmakers did was to capture them on their cameras! No, not true. Dinosaurs do not exist and the ones we see in this movie are computer animations. Any man who does not have any idea about how effective computer animation can be, they are surely going to believe that these mammoth creatures exist. There is much realism in them.Prior to Jurassic Park, you always have had movies which were based on the concept of man vs beast. Once the movie has revealed the dinosaurs to us, the movie essentially becomes a struggle of survival. The dinosaurs are no longer secured and humans are in danger. I did not have any problem in this typicality of the plot. Because, it is not always necessary to create new plots. You can try and improvise on existing ones and show them in a more creative and different way. The Jurassic Park does that. So, I would not call it a weakness in the movie since it handles the overall plot beautifully.If there is one complaint I would have for the movie, it is with regard to the villainous computer nerd who tries to sell off the embryos for cold cash. This part of the movie is a little loose and could have been handled in a better way. Also, the man who gets locked up in the toilet and the hunter getting outsmarted by the dinosaur are some things in the movie that are lame especially in comparison to how the overall plot has been so beautifully handled. But I still cannot take anything away from the movie. Sometimes negatives can be ignored if the positives are overwhelmingly strong. And the positives of the movie are way too strong for these things to be taken too seriously.The movie is meant to be exciting and exciting it no doubt is.

","genre":"Adventure, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"8 October 2008","score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Detractors of The Godfather part III have two main gripes the most obvious is Sofia Coppola's acting skills as Mary Corleone, and the second is the character of Michael Corleone, who bears less resemblance to the cold, calculating criminal mastermind of the first two films. Regarding the first point, I have to agree that Sofia Coppola is insufferable in this film. Thankfully, she had little screen time. However, she looked wonderful she was convincing enough as a cute little lovestruck innocent daughter that I could believe she meant a lot to her family and her father in particular.As to the second point, some things need to be born in mind. The Michael Corleone of the first two films had descended into the lowest possible place, yes, murdering his own brother (among others) by the end. He had become everything he did not want to be and worse his reign over his family's criminal empire was Machiavellian on a level his father had never dreamed of nor would ever have allowed.But by the beginning of this film, a decade and a half had passed since he had crossed the terrible trough of fratricide. Michael's parents and brothers were all dead during this time, Tom Hagan passed away (although the loss of the character was a tragedy, it served the story very well to accent Michael's sense of isolation) and Connie was clearly far too unstable and too much of a yes-woman to ever provide true companionship. Michael was not a man easily resigned to being alone and he had a fierce protective instinct--even if it could be overrode by his jealous vengeful nature--for his own. Remember that in Part I, he always hoped to return to the States as soon as possible and when this seemed a tenebrous goal, he sought a marriage and a new life in Sicily. Throughout Part II, he lost two more members of his family and his wife left him. It is not hard to imagine that the murder of Freddo would in fact be his moral trough, that the pent-up guilt could have spilt over into guilt at having deprived his young children of their mother and perhaps even a fear that they would grow up in his shadow, so he gave them up, even though he knew it meant further isolation.But he knew all along that his cold, calculating criminality had taken him to this horrible place, and so he has spent the years since sloughing through the long marsh out while yet keeping his own person intact and out of prison. Obviously, given how much he aged from Part II to Part III, such a task has taken its toll, both physically and psychologically, and this is portrayed brilliantly. And what of Michael's sudden lavishness? I can tell you from personal experience that when you experience extreme isolation from those you love, you often cling as never before to the greatest treasures of your ethnic and religious heritage, cultivating them with the utmost sincerity partly because these are reminders that you are a real human connected with others and that you belong somewhere. The need to belong somewhere and to something and someone more concrete than the global citizenry is universal, and I don't know how either Puzo or Coppola could have known about this, but they did an amazing job.What good is Confession if you don't repent? Good question. Michael longs for redemption and forgiveness, but almost to the end he seeks legitimacy on his own terms, a quiet retirement from the Mafia. The result is a subtle illustration of the observation of the Curé d'Ambricourt in Robert Bresson's Le journal d'un Curé de campagne You can't bargain with God. You must give yourself up to Him, all at once, as you are. Michael's sins live on apart from him, and by the end are visited full circle on the people he loves.But the ending is cryptic enough that we have to ask was Michael redeemed? Did truth and justice ultimately prevail at the Vatican? Will they ever prevail anywhere, even imperfectly, before the next life?When Anthony Corleone asks of Sicily, Why is such a beautiful country so violent? he opens up yet another flood of mysteries. How to resign ourselves to living in a world of so much beautiful treasure and yet so much of it born in great crime (think, for example, of the great Deicide, of Christ redeeming mankind, nailed to the Cross)--and how and in what circumstances can they be ours for the legitimate taking and cherishing? The Godfather part III provokes such difficult questions in all those willing to see and ponder them.If the acting and cinematography are not as polished as in the second installment, a film set anywhere in Italy needs little visual embellishment, and the music sets the mood for each scene perfectly. The Godfather part III reminds us of the world ever-present outside the closed sphere of Cosa Nostra and captures the struggle of one man teetering on the high-current edge. If you are unwilling to expand your mind beyond criminal exploits and into the personal anguish of their effects on real human beings, stay away. If, however, you have even a slight appreciation for psychology and\/or Roman Catholic moral theology, you will welcome this rounding out of one of the greatest sagas ever invented.

Helena Bonham Carter plays her part in an amazing dual fashion; managing to be both grating and unlikeable on the first viewing, yet sympathetic and endearing upon all subsequent watchings.

His first two films as sole director were both excellent ones, Walkabout from 1971 and Don't Look Now from 1973, but I have never cared for his third film, the overlong, confusing and self-consciously arty The Man who Fell to Earth.Bad Timing, made in 1980, was Roeg's fourth film. The narrative is non-linear in the extreme. It opens with a young American woman, Milena Vognic, being rushed to hospital in Vienna after a drug overdose, probably a suicide attempt. In a series of flashbacks we learn about Milena's past- her marriage to her older Czech husband Stefan, from whom she is estranged (it is not made clear whether they are actually divorced), and her stormy relationship with her boyfriend Alex, an American-born lecturer at Vienna University. Intercut with these are scenes showing Milena lying in the hospital and showing Alex being interviewed by a detective who suspects him of foul play.Roeg suffered the misfortune of seeing his film disowned by its distributor, the Rank Organisation, who denounced it as a film about sick people, made by sick people, for sick people. (I say misfortune, but I suspect that actually a lot of art-house directors would regard criticism like that as a badge of honour). What upset them was presumably the explicit sex scenes, although Rank really should have known what to expect from Roeg. He was, after all, the man responsible for Don't Look Now, with its controversial love scene between Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie.In one respect, however, Rank's criticism is accurate; Bad Timing is indeed a film about sick people. Milena and Alex are clearly, psychologically speaking, damaged goods. Their relationship is essentially a sadomasochistic one- not physical sadomasochism but a form of emotional sadomasochism involving both mutual desire and mutual loathing. The film can be seen as a psychological case-study; it is significant that psychology is the subject which Alex teaches, and also that the film is set in Vienna, the city of Freud.I have nothing against non-linear narration in principle; it can often be an effective (sometimes the most effective) way of telling a story. It is, moreover, not necessarily a modernist or avant-garde idea. Those who think of it as an invention of the French Nouvelle Vague of the sixties should watch John Brahm's The Locket from 1946, a film with a particularly intricate flashback within a flashback within a flashback structure. (That film was also a psychological case study). In the case of Bad Timing, however, the film's narrative structure makes it confusing and difficult to follow. Although it aims at a psychological study of the two main characters, we do not learn enough about them to enable us to understand them. I was left wanting to know more about the background to Milena's relationship with Alex (and, even more, about her rather mysterious relationship with Stefan). As the critic of Variety put it, most of the milestones are missing from the characters' tortuous psychological route.Another criticism I would have would be the casting of Art Garfunkel as Alex. Much as I admire Garfunkel for his musical achievements, he was not, on the evidence of this film, much of an actor. Roeg clearly liked using rock stars in his films, because the leading role in The Man who Fell to Earth is taken by David Bowie, an equally unsuccessful piece of casting. (To be fair to Bowie, he was to give better performances in some of his later films).The gorgeous Theresa Russell, who was later to become Roeg's wife, is better as Milena, and, as is often the case with Roeg, there are some striking visual touches.

In fact the only instances that warrant any reactions of a definite kind are ones of freight, as expressed by protagonist Jeffrey Beaumont (MacLachlan) when it looks as if he will become victim to a mad gangster and damsel in distress (but not as you know it) Dorothy Vallens (Rossellini) whose principal reactions are distress and concern, particularly when faced with the closest she can get to loved ones following a kidnap scenario.The film begins in a fashion that immediately places it in the realm of the implacable; odd and perhaps disturbing images in a cacophony of visuals that do not match, but Lynch knows they don't match, thus getting across firstly the setting of the film; in a suburban American world inspired by the decade of the 1950s and secondly, the ambiance of the film. In this sense it is what you might be familiar with and what you might perceive to be 'idyllic' or 'perfect' but is actually far from it. The shots of quaint suburban houses and fire trucks going by in slow-motion are juxtaposed by an old man suffering a stroke and close ups of beetles fighting in the undergrowth, simple but effective in establishment and atmosphere.But for all the complications that arise when certain scenes happen, Blue Velvet begins as routinely and as straight forward as you could imagine. Jeffery, our young and outgoing hero, is out walking and just happens to stumble across a human ear in a grassy field on the way home. For all the supposedly complicated studies of fetishisms and attention to cross-genres that follow, Lynch shoots this scene almost purposely unspectacularly in an attempt to maybe lure the audience into a false sense of spectacle. I think Lynch identifies the passive viewer looking at what's on the surface there in front of them but also identifies the active viewer looking at what's beneath the surface; he shoots the initial incident which acts as the catalyst of the whole film in a mundane manner consisting of mid-shot, close up and then the guy picks the item up.So this deliberately spectacular event (I can't remember too many other instances where someone finds an ear in a film) is shot unspectacularly and what follows is the expected trip to the police station and that intrigue young blood possesses, not helped out by the fact Jeffery is attracted to detective work anyway and the police won't give him a clue. He lets female friend Sandy Williams (Dern) in on the find and they go off inspecting once they get Dorothy's address through one way or another. It's the initial scenes involving Dorothy that perhaps give the film its cult status; scenes that tap into voyeurism and fetishism while definitely delivering on a dramatic level at the same time.Jeffery is initially caught by Dorothy but the voyeurism isn't necessarily there since he is forced to hide from her anyway. I do not think Jeffery gets a sexual thrill out of seeing Dorothy go about her business prior to Frank Booth entering but once he is caught, the study begins to form. Initially, Dorothy panics at someone being in her room but changes her tack quite quickly, quickly becoming the dominant half of a relationship that has lasted a mere ten seconds whilst armed with a knife. Enter Frank Booth (Hopper) and Jeffery is back hiding in the wardrobe; now following the apparent immediacy of a sex act prior to this scene. The manner in which Dorothy changes her mind and tries to get one back up of Jeffery for watching alerts the audience and primes them for the scenes with Frank to come; scenes of a fetishistic nature.As a stand alone character, the film is greatly indebted to him for its cult status. It is the character of Frank as not just another gangster that spouts dialogue and kidnaps people that makes this film; he is a human being in a world whom has fetishes and quirks and if he is a stereotype then he is one with preferences. From here, the activity that follows has Dorothy now know she is being watched and the fetishistic acts cover a range of bizarre needs, throwing in sadomasochism and infantilism (once Frank spouts 'Mommy!') to a mix already containing the want for gags, velvets, gasmasks and scissors to cut clothes. Following on from the previous scene with Jeffery, Dorothy is suddenly relegated to the role of the submissive and Jeffery is dumped back down to the role of the voyeur with Frank as the dominant figure, something he carries with him throughout the film and something Lynch introduces to us in these very scenes.So Blue Velvet is a success, less so for its 'cult' status thanks to scenes the mainstream are perhaps unfamiliar with but more so for its effectiveness in the build up to its interesting plot and fascinating characters. The film borrows from noir in the sense it's a 1950s inspired world that they live and the film follows a detective route. Guns, gangsters and a hapless guy in too deep is just some of the fun to be had out of Blue Velvet, but I use 'fun' in a careful manner.

Given the freedom of a feature film the writers create something which justifies a theatrical release based on its scale and storyline, but which also avoids (until the last ten minutes, at least) the sort of bloat and\/or dumbing-down which is usually the result of a theatrical film version of a TV show, see The X Files or The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse.South Park Bigger Longer & Uncut is a strikingly, uproariously hilarious satirical take on the MPAA rating system, parents' media watchdog groups, Canadian-American relations (okay, so this part isn't so much a satirical take as a bunch of well-written Canada jokes which, as a Canadian, are absolutely hysterical), Les Miserables, the controversial nature of South Park as a television series, and warmongering in general. Like the television show it manages to be political but completely irreverent and uninterested in expressing any form of liking or support for either end of the political spectrum. The musical numbers are the most memorable and inspired sections of the film, particularly Uncle F-cka, Blame Canada, and It's Easy, M'Kay. The only musical numbers that don't work are the two relatively short ones by Satan, although his beau Saddam gets a really good one here in I Can Change. Actually, the film would have been perfect had it not included the really unfunny sub-plot with Satan and Saddam. It fits with how cheerfully offensive the movie in general is, but it's just unfunny. These scenes, and the bloated ending (which goes from tolerable to bad when Saddam and Satan show up) are the only problematic scenes in the whole movie, the rest of which is just perfect. Sure, it's rude, crude, offensive to some, and jam-packed with profanity, but South Park Bigger Longer & Uncut is also, much like the best episodes of South Park, genuinely funny, intelligent, and perceptive, and it has a lot to say.

Actually, the film would have been perfect had it not included the really unfunny sub-plot with Satan and Saddam. It fits with how cheerfully offensive the movie in general is, but it's just unfunny. These scenes, and the bloated ending (which goes from tolerable to bad when Saddam and Satan show up) are the only problematic scenes in the whole movie, the rest of which is just perfect. Sure, it's rude, crude, offensive to some, and jam-packed with profanity, but South Park Bigger Longer & Uncut is also, much like the best episodes of South Park, genuinely funny, intelligent, and perceptive, and it has a lot to say. It's brilliant, brilliant comedy.9\/10 ","genre":"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"},{"date":"8 October 2008","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" A Bug's Life is a very good animated feature. This movie is for younger children, but it is also a great movie for people my age. The story is about an ant named Flik. He brought havoc onto his colony when he destroyed the food that were for the superior grasshoppers. He gets banished and he must find bigger bugs to fix the mess. This movie is a classic because it is a good movie and it is a Pixar movie. The animation is brilliant especially for the late 90's. The story is good, but a little more detail would be suffice. The voice acting is good as with most animation movies. The music is nice to listen to. Nothing special, but it earned an nomination for one of the music categories. Overall, this movie struck me as awestruck. This is a good movie for all families. I rate this movie 10\/10.

The script is embarrassingly risible, the direction is pedestrian but the acting is dire, dire, dire..... how come these people get paid?. The two lead characters look, for most of the film, like the cardboard on the back of a cereal packet. I have never rated Sherilyn Fenn very highly... her performances in both Boxing Helena and Twin Peaks were, to put it mildly, amateurish but in this film she makes even a piece of dead wood look like an Oscar winner.I managed to sit through only 20 minutes of this rubbish before switching off the DVD and throwing it away! Erotic???? There's more eroticism in a wet paper bag floating down a drain in a rainstorm! Zalman King should take up dominoes instead.... he certainly can't direct a film and, as for his script..... my 5 year old grand daughter can string words together to create better, more interesting and cohesive sentences than his.This is an insult to the film industry.Even if someone offers you money to watch it... don't.... avoid it like the plague!
