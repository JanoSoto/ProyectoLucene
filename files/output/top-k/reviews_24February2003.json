I must admit, I had been intrigued by the trailers - looked like a good old fright-from-outer-space picture to me. It isn't, though - more's the pity.Signs does employ a few time-honoured tools of the genre - inexplicable phenomena (corn circles - could have been a good hook), the fact that you don't really see the creatures until quite late, and the classic situation of it all happening to (or at least centring on) a lonesome farmstead, all these are classic devices.But what comes along in this garb is not actually an alien-shocker sort of film, but rather a drama of spiritual rediscovery (potted Cleric loses wife, as a consequence loses faith, but it turns out her last words as well as some of the action in the film preceding the finale can be interpreted as divine predetermination\/intervention, and badabing-badaboom he rediscovers his faith). Quite apart form the fact that I'm personally not likely to be impressed by challenge-to-faith storylines (unless done in manners as excellent as Dead Man Walking), I think this is what spoiled the film for me trying to both spiritually challenging and suspenseful, it fails on both counts.As to the first the alien invasion is not plotted well enough to make the viewer really interested. We don't know why they come (or where they come from), we do not get to know anything about their greater strategies, and most of all, we do not get a satisfying bust-up at the end (someone found a way to repeal them, apparently - that's all we are told. And there's a scene in which an alien is vanquished by the judicious use of a baseball bat and tap-water - effective, maybe, but hardly riveting. independence Day - need I say more? Not a film I find intellectually interesting, but then, so few of the alien take-over genre are). Of course I am aware of the fact that the invasion is incidental to the film's main theme, the vicar's return to the godhead - rather like the murder in Gosford Park - but a) the trailer should have given me an idea of that and b) that storyline is beset with problems of its own.Actually, for me at least, its really only one problem its too pat to be in any way engaging. At the centre of the picture, a dialogue scene is used to introduce a dualist view of humanity those who believe in predetermination, and those who believe in the essential randomness of life. The film then continues to integrate disparate occurrences (from the dead wife's last words to a child's bad habit of leaving half-empty water glasses standing around) into the parson's final revelation that God must exist because why else would it all make sense in the final instance. Unfortunately, it's all too glib for my taste - where's the spiritual challenge? Getting over a loved one's death has been done better before. Not to mention the fact that the central dialogue mentioned is unbelievably trite, theologically about as sophisticated as a penny catechism, and geared towards an audience of the literalist kind with a Manichean world-view (dare I say US American at this point?) - and not towards anyone with a shred of interest in the psychological machinations of fitting a disastrous event into an essentially optimistic religious world view.Failing both as a suspenseful and technically interesting exercise in the alien invasion genre and as an exploration of crise de foi, I cannot recommend this film - watch it when your flatmate\/partner rents it, but don't rent it yourself.

I also understand that the crop circle\/alien aspect of the film was simply a tool to simultaneously get people in the seats and test the faith of the story's characters.  But does that mean that all of the gaping plot holes involving the aliens (which I will not list here because so many other posts already have pointed them out) should be forgiven?  Of course not.  Regardless of the director's motives regarding the aliens, this is still bad movie making.  There are also many plot holes involving the family (which have also been listed ad nauseum).  Plot holes aside, it's still just a flat out lousy movie.  Shyamalan takes himself and his stories way too seriously.  He thinks way too highly of himself.  He wants to be the greatest director of this generation, a hybrid master somewhere between Spielbergian sentimentality and Hitchcockian thrills.  He also seems to be repeating himself already with his past three films in trying to perfect a new genre--the tear-jerk thriller.  I think Shyamalan is capable of making good movies.  The Sixth Sense was a decent, well crafted, well acted film, although not nearly as great as many propose.  He can also make interesting films.  Unbreakable was probably the only film where I was totally enthralled by the first hour or so, and then flat out hated the film by the last half hour.  Signs could have been a decent B-movie (even if it was still about faith and family) but Shyamalan approached the material far too reverently, as did all the actors.  Just because a movie is about faith doesn't mean it is good, or even well intentioned.  Again, with his supposed twist of an ending (and what a wretched ending this movie had), Shyamalan seems to think every movie has to have a twist (and a moral).

Unbreakable had an appalling and ridiculous twist (ewww...it was actually a comic book movie BOOO HISSSSSSS) and Signs has a completely inept and unnecessary twist, that really isn't a twist at all.

The Sixth Sense was a decent, well crafted, well acted film, although not nearly as great as many propose.  He can also make interesting films.  Unbreakable was probably the only film where I was totally enthralled by the first hour or so, and then flat out hated the film by the last half hour.  Signs could have been a decent B-movie (even if it was still about faith and family) but Shyamalan approached the material far too reverently, as did all the actors.  Just because a movie is about faith doesn't mean it is good, or even well intentioned.  Again, with his supposed twist of an ending (and what a wretched ending this movie had), Shyamalan seems to think every movie has to have a twist (and a moral).  Sixth Sense had a good and appropriate twist.  Unbreakable had an appalling and ridiculous twist (ewww...it was actually a comic book movie BOOO HISSSSSSS) and Signs has a completely inept and unnecessary twist, that really isn't a twist at all.  In fact, this really wasn't a movie at all.  This movie was neither scary nor touching, nor well made nor well intentioned.  There isn't a rating low enough to indicate how much I hated this film.

That all said, it was so dramatic and amature that I couldn't help but laughing all the way through it.

Then, in 1997, almost a decade later, another `Vacation' film churned out. The fourth in the series. `Vegas Vacation.' Clark Griswold has finally gotten his break. His food preservatives have been approved, and he has gotten a bonus. Now, what to do with the money? He has an idea. Take the wife and kids to.(big surprise) Vegas! But soon after the ordeal of arriving in Vegas is over, Clark finds himself wasting away his money gambling; especially playing craps! Now, with the help of Uncle> Eddie, he must regain his money, and regain his wife from the grasp of Wayne Newton! Chevy Chase returns to the role of Clark Griswold, he gets these crazy notions and perfect ideas built up in his head, and as we have learned in the other films, they always disintegrate one at a time until he blows his top. Beverly D'Angelo returns to the character of Ellen Griswold, she pulls off the housewife\/mother role quite believably; she is not nearly as bad as anyone would expect. Many people say she was in the first movie just to flash the screen a few times, but that's just from the mouths of people who dislike the movies; I think her role is important, and D'Angelo carries it well. The only other person I can think of that fits the Ellen character is Goldie Hawn, but that's probably because she acts a bit like D'Angelo so it is easier to imagine her as Ellen. The kids in this `Vacation' film are (finally!) older; Rusty is on the verge of manhood, and Audrey has matured as well. The things they get themselves into during the film are quite funny. Audrey becomes a Vegas dancer, and Rusty becomes a rich tycoon with the help from some `friends.' We splice back and forth to their predicaments during the film. One hilarious segment includes a bit where the Griswold family visits Uncle Eddie (a returning Randy Quaid) out in the middle of nowhere; he says that he got his land for free from the government because it used to be a nuclear test site (`I got tomatoes growing this big!'). Uncle Eddie is more disgusting than ever; he lives in a small trailer with about forty-something kids, all of which have strange deformations. In `Vegas Vacation,' Randy Quaid has the longest screen time that Eddie's ever had before, and I think this is a good thing. Perhaps some people thought it went a bit over the top with Eddie, but I say, `The more Eddie, the better!' Wallace Shawn makes a rather long cameo as the craps dealer; Clark has a vengeance built up against Shawn's character. He MUST beat him. However, Clark always loses and that is how he loses all his money. Wayne Newton takes a rather big role as well. He pretends to be in love with Ellen Griswold (`It's a lock of my hair.') in the film; he tries to steal her from Clark, who forgets to pay attention to his wife while he blows his money away like it's just paper and nothing more. John Hughes, writer of `Vacation' and `Christmas Vacation,' did NOT return to the keyboard for this one; someone else wrote it. I think, however, that the writer of `Vegas Vacation' wrote the script well; the jokes are plentiful and enjoyable. It's nowhere near as bad as some comedy sequels get (i.e. `Police Academy' sequels).Many people really hated `Vegas Vacation,' saying that is was just not funny. But no one can tell me they didn't laugh - or even chuckle - at this film. I understand that it is not as good as the first film, but to tell you the truth, I used to have a hard time choosing a favorite - the three films (`Vegas,' `Christmas,' and the original - NOT counting the `European' sequel) are so different and funny that it really is hard to choose. However, `Vegas' is more familiar to the first film than the sequel(s), and it's a bit easier to compare. When I look closely at them, I decide (a) the first film was a first, and no one had ever experienced Clark Griswold before; (b) the jokes are a bit better and (c) the cast was a bit younger back then and could go for more physical gags. In the new film, Clark swings over the Hoover Dam, and it looks like Chevy really strained himself doing some of the physical stuff (even if it means dangling over a green screen). All in all, I feel that `Vegas Vacation' is a very underrated comedy. I really, really enjoyed it, and had a fun time watching it.

That's kind of a lot, I think.  The average number of penises per movie is pretty close to zero, so two is a bunch.  Do the penises have anything to do with the movie?  NO!  Do they add anything to it?  Um...that depends on whether you like seeing them in movies.  As for the movie...I hated it the first time I saw it.  It was just too much.

Although it lacks the social commentary of Clockwork Orange and the philosophy of 2001, I think that this is By Far Kubrick's most beautiful masterpiece. The sets, costumes, and especially cinematography are all utterly amazing. Every single shot is new and wonderful and most of all Memorable. From the opening shot of Barry's father and another man dueling, to the masterful final scene of Lady Lyndon, every aspect of this film is magnificant. In fact, a true connoisseur of cinema can almost sense the overwhelming skill and genius that went into making this film. The acting is very good, not great because the script did not require much acting skill as the narrator of the film gives away practically every event before it happens. I think that this film stands alone as the most beautiful film ever produced, and it alone would qualify Kubrick as one of the greatest directors of all time.

When I have a bad day or have the blues I slap this movie in and enjoy not just the great music but the great interaction between the leading cast members which include Hanks' look-a-like Tom Everett Scott, Steve Zahn, Jonathan Schaech and as notated in the credits The Bass Player Ethan Embry, collectively known as The Oneders, oops! make that The Wonders.        Hanks show us just how multi-talented he is by writing and directing this movie PLUS he re-created the innocence and joy of music from the 60's in minute detail. Hanks is the writer of the title song and of the offbeat instrumental Spartacus and it knocks me out that he has these incredible talents for so many artistic creations Actor, Director, song writer, et.al. He also directs this movie as well as playing Play-Tone Manager, Mr White who leads the The Wonders to success through the Play-Tone label.      Tom Everett Scott looks a lot like Tom Hanks during his Bosom Buddy days on TV, and I suspect that Hanks created this movie to showcase the talent that is Tom Everett Scott.  Scott steals the movie with his humor, his sincere caring of others and if he is really a drummer, his talent! Zahn was great as the comic relief and Schaech was not only very handsome but very believable in portraying the moody Jimmy, lead singer, who has the true artistic temperament but is lacking in certain sensitivities.      The songs are snappy and catchy, capturing the true zenith of rock and roll in 1960's America.  The catchy Play-Tone label, also created by Hanks, the reproductions of TV shows of the 60's, and the ambience of a time when rock and roll was growing up and showing off are all in this great movie.  The title song, That Thing You Do is actually a great tune and I find myself wanting to hear it now and then, and sing along with it.      Liv Tyler as Faye was very sweet as the wronged girlfriend but I don't get how  having a really bad cold during the West coast California showcasing had any revelance to the movie except to show that Guy noticed she was sick and was always there for her and thinking of her when Jimmy wasn't. Look for performances by Charlize Theron and Giovanni Ribisi as well.      This is a light-hearted movie that you can just sit back, enjoy, sing a long with, and laugh.  The biggest plus is that in watching the credits it is incredible to see that Hanks wrote many of the songs, the music, created the 60's TV shows so realistically and is not only a member of the Screen Actors Guild but also the Song Writers Guild - so many feathers in his already much-plummed hat. Does Tom Hanks' talents have no end? I hope not. Check out Road to Perdition for further proof.       Rita Wilson, Hanks' wife, makes an appearance at the Blue Spot where Jazz greats meet to jam and have cock and bull sessions and where Guy meets his idol, Dale Paxton. Their own jam session results in Spartacus, a great jazz instrumental, also written by Tom Hanks.      Before you rewind the movie, wait for the end of the credits to see two of The Wonders music videos, including That Thing You Do!     In summary, I love that thing that Tom Hanks does with this well-made and entertaining comedy! ","genre":null},{"date":"24 February 2003","score":"","review":"   I love this movie!
