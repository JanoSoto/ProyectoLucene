No one had ever heard of the directors, the Wachowski brothers. Their only other movie directorial effort was Bound, which no one ever saw. (Turns out, Bound was simply an audition to prove to the studios that they knew how to direct and could handle the project that was The Matrix). The actors were a mixed bag of good actors (Laurence Fishburne, Joe Pantoliano), bad actors (Keanu Reeves) and then unknown actors (Carrie-Ann Moss and Hugo Weaving). The previews gave nothing away. You were simply left with the question `What Is The Matrix?' and a few images of some very cool action. The only thing I knew at the time was that I HAD to go see the movie the night it was released.Before I go any further, I need to make a confession. I am the target demographic for this movie. As such, my opinion of this movie is biased from the word go. I love video games, I like kung fu, I like science fiction, I like comic books, and I like technology. The one overwhelming mantra of The Matrix is that the Wachowski brothers use everything, pop culture, religion, video games, you name it and blend it all together to make something new. Since they used all the things that I like already, the movie was a wicked cocktail that hooked me from the instant I tasted it. I loved the story, the action, the cinematography, even the acting.Fishburne and Joey Pants are great character actors and I tend to love their work regardless of the film their in. Keanu Reeves is a different story. Other than the Bill & Ted movies, Keanu's acting hasn't been all that good. Johnny Mnemonic was a bomb in no small part thanks to Keanu's lack of skill as an actor. He's stiff, doesn't convey a lot of emotion and his delivery is stilted. His main redeeming quality is that he looks good. All his negatives became positives in the Wachowski's hands. The character of Neo is one where you need someone stiff and emotionless, but looks good as he's kicking butt. Keanu more than fits the bill. This was the role he was meant to play.The story was good, but the storytelling was the hallmark for me. For many people the cinematography was all new to them. Some people had never seen camera angles like they found in the Matrix, but I had in comic books and in Japanese Animation aka anime. In comic books, the method of storytelling is done through still images. Although that may sound somewhat stilted, it can actually give some freedom because each frame and show you more detail, slow things down, or speed things up. If anything it gives you a wide latitude with perspective. Anime takes a similar approach because much of anime is done on such a small budget. For example, one trick that anime uses is to take a still image and have the `camera' move from left to right. This gives the impression of movement, but it's really just a single still image. These tricks created an entire style that anime still uses today even though the budget may be bigger.The Wachowski's came from a comic book background, and one of the things that they were trying to do was bring some of the storytelling style from comic books and anime to the silver screen. Trinity's jump, bullet time, and the fight between Neo and Agent Smith in the subway are all examples of 2d comic book and Japanese anime style that was realized in film. Motion pictures, comic books and animation are all simply mediums to tell a story. The Wachowski brothers blended the styles and blurred the lines between the mediums.The techniques that the director's used in the Matrix changed film as we know it. Hardly any action movie today doesn't use kung fu wire work. Charlie's Angels, The Rundown, and even Le Pacte des Loups all used the fighting style made popular in The Matrix. Star Wars may have been a landmark movie because it changed how science fiction was done, but The Matrix did that and more. The ripple effect of this movie has left it's mark on so many filmakers that it's hard to watch any action or science fiction film and not see touches of The Matrix in them.In 1999 the Wachowski brothers released a landmark film that changed film, and to some extent our culture, forever. It came out of the blue and blew us all away. It would be four years before their story could continue, but it was all worth the wait.

Why?  For the simple reason of watching all its sequels and spin-offs before I determined my final judgment.  Whaddaya know, my rating still hasn't changed, or at least not significantly (I like it a little less than my very first viewing, some three viewings back).  This movie has been, through and through, a *** picture, no more  and sometimes possibly even less.By day, Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) leads a simple and uneventful life as an office worker who dwells in his little cubicle.  By night, he's Neo, a first-rate computer hacker who feels there's something not quite right with his world.  At a nightclub, he meets Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), a dark-haired woman who gives him even more cryptic answers to his questions. Curious, Neo pursues for further answers, leading him to a mysterious man named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne).And it's during a particularly dark and stormy night that Neo discovers the truth; the entire world is a program fabricated by machines of artificial intelligence that have overrun the planet.  These machines feed off sleeping humans as a battery source to continue their own existence. When Neo is awakened, he's in for an even bigger shock; he's the destined hero to free the human race from the machines.  Whoa.There are a lot more intriguing plot elements, including the mention of an underground city called Zion, the last refuge of the human race with a population of approximately 250,000.  The program the humans are in, called the Matrix, operates and keeps the fabricated world in order through individuals called agents, who have the ability to take over anyone connected to the matrix in the similated world.  This is all a tad more complicated than it seems; unless you really hate science fiction with a furious passion, you'll probably find the plot fairly easy to absorb (then again, I'm still surprised by the number of those who find themselves completely confused by this movie's plot).The central storyline, Neo's ascent to near deification, is interesting if not as well-handled as one would like.  I enjoy the fact that most of the film focuses on the individuals aboard a ship called the Nebuchednezzar. Scaling down this epic tale affords more opportunity for character development, which writers\/directors The Wachowski Brothers use to their advantage on several occasions.As a sci-fi tale, The Matrix runs fairly smoothly.  None of the ideas presented are particularly original, but they're fascinating concepts and they're presented in an intriguing fashion.  It's through the visuals that The Matrix succeeds in delivering its plot; by giving us a world in which rules can be bent and even broken, there's ample opportunity to display jaw-dropping visual effects that have rarely, if ever, been used in this manner.Unfortunately, there's still much about the sci-fi aspect that's sorely underused or unexploited.  If the Matrix is, in fact, a world in which the A.I. could manipulate to their advantage, it's disappointing that all they do is put up a few brick walls and throw a few kung-fu skilled agents into the mix.  I expect a lot more than just martial arts in a movie that claims to turn the world upside down as we know it.Unfortunately, the story nearly falls apart at the point the Oracle (Gloria Foster) gives Neo her prophecy, and like the rest of the film, chooses not to give any clear-cut answers and istead merely mentions that Neo has to make a choice that could result in either his or Morpheus' death.  She also mentions he's not the One but has the gift (uh-huh, makes it sound like being the One is an occupation open to application).  Almost as bad is the fact Neo fails to pry further in his questioning.  He just stands there with barely a single expression on his face.If the Oracle can tell the immediate future, she should learn to actually do more than spout a lot of nonsense that proves pretty futile (this would later really mar the sequels).  This scene completely insults me because it's obvious the Wachowskis only wanted to try and obscure the climax for us.  If you actually believe either Neo or Morpheus will die at the end or if Neo isn't really the One, then maybe the Wachowskis know their target audience better than I do.But by far the kneecapper of the whole picture and ultimately the reason why I can never muster more enthusiasm for it is the scene where Neo chooses to rescue Morpheus and risk almost certain death.  What does he do?  He loads himself up with heavy artillery and with Trinity's assistance shoots up a lobby full of security guards without showing the slightest hint of emotion. I understand this is for the Greater Good, but that our hero, who so previously had been in shock at the discovery of the reality of his entire universe, could kill dozens of innocents without even batting an eyelash is absolutely confounding.  I almost didn't care about the rest of the film after this scene.The action sequences afterward are thrilling enough to provide momentary distraction, especially the kickass subway martial arts battle between Neo and Agent Smith.  But somehow the film sidetracks itself yet again with a melodramatic and overdone climax that would be more fitting in a daytime soap opera than an epic motion picture.Still, most everything before that is entertaining and interesting enough that I definitely recommend this picture.  I should also mention Hugo Weaving's performance; the man has carved a name for himself in this memorable role, crafting one of the best pure villains I've ever seen.  He is, in fact, so good I'd almost choose him over the heroes.Undoubtedly, The Matrix trilogy will be endlessly debated for the years to come, but I'm neither one who finds himself in ecstasy over this picture nor do I despise this film with seething hatred.  It's enjoyable enough to stand up to quite a few viewings, which means there's plenty of worthwhile material on hand.  You just have to bear through the subpar stuff to get to it.

I see 'Crouching Tiger' as his method of gaining pop status, not pushing limits.  Compare the content here to prior junk in 'Matrix'.The story is a farce, too simple.  How many Bruce Lee, John Woo, or even Peckinpah films have been loaded with the same filler?  Even the acting is just flat.  Four years later and no performance rings in my mind.  I'm wondering if Lee ever examined Kurosawa's work because so much could have been applied.I guess Lee wanted to be Raimi and Woo but didn't want to prove that he was better.  Raimi's films are always stupid in the basic qualities because they rely on his visual intuitiveness.  Woo has been making the same movie since 'Heroes Shed No Tears', never deviating from formula.It's in that respect where I hold Lee in high regard always trying to do something new.  Woo, Cameron, and Burton all found their niches, but I doubt Lee ever will.  He'll keep experimenting and I will admire him for that.So here is an uncomplicated look at an old genre.  Performed by a master, but clumsily so.  'Hulk' showed Lee really experimenting with the comic book medium, but there isn't any new blood in this project.

In later years, they were just as often buddy movies. Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid is kind of where one became the other. It's lasted because it's so good, and also because it did some things that were unusual at the time but became very customary soon after.It's funny to read the comments from people knocking this film as a form of praising The Wild Bunch. They were both westerns made in 1969, and the main characters in both are outlaws, but there's not much else they have in common other than Strother Martin and Latinos dying in slo-mo. Disparaging Butch Cassidy because it's not Wild Bunch is like attacking Star Wars for not being Gone With The Wind.I think Wild Bunch is great, too, but in a much different way, tough, mean, and brutal. Butch Cassidy is a sunny charmer, aimed squarely at the mainstream but with nice touches throughout that surprise you with their understated brilliance. The opening kinescope sequence; the sepia washing into the blue horizon as Butch and Sundance ride away from the card game; the still photograph section during the trip to New York, and especially the powerful last shot. There's nothing crazy or clever about the film, except when you realize it was designed to attract theater goers and did so despite taking so many chances within its conventional form.The music riles some. You can read them all here. Bacharach and David were totally wrong for this type of movie, what's with all those 'Dating Game' tunes, I fast-forward through the bicycle part, etc. As Sundance would say of these criticisms Bitch, bitch, bitch! Butch Cassidy works because it is anachronistic. It's not cinema verite, it's not trying to seem real for a second. The kinescope bit at the beginning is your clue, this is a western movie that's fully aware of its nature as a movie, and expects the same from the audience.That being said, I'd like to add that the bicycle sequence is my favorite part, because of the great song, the wordless interaction of Paul Newman and Katharine Ross, the way the sunlight dapples the lace curtains and the caramel locks of Etta's hair. It's also something else, too, the one moment of peace Butch gets and an oddly effective grace note in his otherwise miserable life. The look he gives the bull after crashing through the fence is not just cute but summarizes in one priceless instant Butch's approach to life's travails throughout the film.I used to think the chase part went on too long, but now I just sit back and enjoy the banter, and the gorgeous scenery. (I don't know where Conrad Hall shot this picture, but I have a hard time believing it was anywhere on Planet Earth.) Nothing else to complain about with this one, nothing.Obviously the most appealing aspect of this film are the two leads. Its a happy miracle that with all the big names being bandied around, we ended up with Newman and Robert Redford. Warren Beatty and Steve McQueen wouldn't have worked not because of inferior acting skills but inferior chemistry. Newman and Redford work so well with each other because they aren't competing but playing off each other. They are actors, and they have egos, but there's no stench of narcissism connected to this movie. That's why it's so enjoyable even through the slow stretches, and why it's a shame Newman and Redford only did one other movie together after this.George Roy Hill directed that movie, The Sting, as well as this, and it's bewildering how little credit he seems to get for his work. Sure, he won an Oscar for The Sting, and was nominated for one for this, but he's nearly forgotten today. Maybe it's because he was so versatile. Hill made Slap Shot and The World Of Henry Orient; two films as far apart as any in terms of demographic appeal. Butch Cassidy is one of the most inventive, successful mainstream films ever made, and it's inventive and successful because Hill was the man with the plan behind it.One other thing If you like this movie but don't have this on DVD, get it.

It's a generously front-loaded item featuring gorgeous imaging, an informative commentary track, penetrating interviews with all the stars looking back, and most especially a documentary Hill narrated a year after the film came out which details the many challenges he confronted making this movie.

As a document of history, the film falls far short. Using an array of film-making tricks and techniques Stone has created a long but engrossing tale, juggling dozens of remarkable characters and intertwining multiple stories and theories. The regrettable part is that in the end -- like in reality -- you don't know who or what to believe, which would be fine if that was Stone's conclusion. But in mixing reality and fantasy, archival footage and new footage, together to make them indistinguishable, Stone aims at presenting a solution to this great American mystery. Even granting the need for dramatic license, the film has serious issues when it comes to integrity. Just as you can't be just a little bit pregnant, you can't add just a little bit of fiction into fact and claim historical truth.The irony is that the very paranoia that fuels the film and inspired Stone to fully invest his talent is also the element that robs the film of credibility.Though Stone hedges his bets a bit by framing much of the story as supposition and presents reenactments of events that may or may not have really happened, the final conclusion that the audience is left with is that President Kennedy was the victim of a vast conspiracy consisting of the CIA, the Mafia, Fidel Castro, LBJ, an oddball band of communist sympathizers and a few odds and ends homosexuals, whose motives are never made clear. Just about everybody is culpable, except possibly Lee Harvey Oswald. By the time Stone's protagonist, the discredited and otherwise long-forgotten New Orleans prosecutor, Jim Garrison, gets Clay Shaw, a gay New Orleans business man, to trial on charges of conspiracy, the film itself seems to have lost all reason. Only the momentum of Stone's storytelling justifies the otherwise inexplicable trail that leads to Shaw.But, boy what storytelling it is. Cleverly using a cast of name actors -- a move that, no doubt, help get the film financed -- Stone gives identities to a huge collection of characters who might otherwise confuse the audience. This also gives credibility to his illusion of historical authenticity. Using the infamous Zapruder film as a centerpiece to his recreation of the assassination, the film takes on the air of a documentary.But it isn't a documentary. Much of his depiction of facts is discredited theory, crackpot ideas and plain old everyday paranoia. For all of its brilliance, JFK never ties things together into a believable whole. One is apt to leave the film convinced of a conspiracy, but without any real evidence to back up the suspicions.An added irritation provided by Stone's view is that President John Kennedy is ultimately trivialized by the entire enterprise. Despite the title, Kennedy is almost a nonentity in the film. Though Stone suggests that it was Kennedy's supposed intent to pull out of the war in Vietnam that was the motive for his assassination, that all seems like a wild guess on Stone's part rather than an accepted fact. And Kennedy himself, no matter what his worth was as a world leader, a charismatic politician, a pop icon, a family man or a human being, is reduced to being little more than a human target in Stone's little world.

Even though I was confused and perplexed during the movie (particularly the second half), I was still gripped by what I was watching. I especially enjoyed Naomi Watts' performance, especially considering her character(s) goes from one extreme to the next.Unlike most movies I've seen, Mulholland Drive made me think afterwards and made me want to research it out. I found Salon.com's assessment of the movie to be most helpful and interesting. It may not be 100% correct, but it did shed some light on the story.This movie was also the first time I've ever watched anything from the cult director David Lynch. Say whatever you want about Mr. Lynch, but for better or for worse, you definitely know when you're watching one of his movies. Most directors don't really stick out to me. They are talented, yes, but their contribution to a movie doesn't necessarily mean I can obviously notice their personal touch. David Lynch has his own offbeat style that's very recognizable, much like Stanley Kubrick and Quentin Tarantino. You may love David Lynch's style or you may be baffled by it (or both), but you know that a David Lynch movie is not going to be a run-of-the-mill picture.Overall, I'd say that Mulholland Drive is definitely a unique movie, which is probably an understatement. The story, while confusing, has a lot of depth to it if you ever want to research it out. The acting is well done, headed by Naomi Watts' powerful dual performance and Laura Harring's strong, quiet performance. Like the story, the direction is confusing, but it does stick out. As for the visuals, they will stick in your head for quite a while. I think Roger Ebert said it best that after watching Mulholland Drive, you'll tell your friends that you watched the strangest movie, much like you would tell them that you had the strangest dream.My IMDb Rating 9\/10.

Say whatever you want about Mr. Lynch, but for better or for worse, you definitely know when you're watching one of his movies. Most directors don't really stick out to me. They are talented, yes, but their contribution to a movie doesn't necessarily mean I can obviously notice their personal touch. David Lynch has his own offbeat style that's very recognizable, much like Stanley Kubrick and Quentin Tarantino. You may love David Lynch's style or you may be baffled by it (or both), but you know that a David Lynch movie is not going to be a run-of-the-mill picture.Overall, I'd say that Mulholland Drive is definitely a unique movie, which is probably an understatement. The story, while confusing, has a lot of depth to it if you ever want to research it out. The acting is well done, headed by Naomi Watts' powerful dual performance and Laura Harring's strong, quiet performance. Like the story, the direction is confusing, but it does stick out. As for the visuals, they will stick in your head for quite a while. I think Roger Ebert said it best that after watching Mulholland Drive, you'll tell your friends that you watched the strangest movie, much like you would tell them that you had the strangest dream.My IMDb Rating 9\/10.

Of course, had Maximus done the most sensible thing and called his army for help, then Commodus would have been wiped out and the movie would have been over within 15 minutes.

No, but only because the story dictates that we should wait for the climax, not for any logical reason.The coincidence that Maximus, fleeing from Germany to Spain on foot, which would have taken a few months at least, finds his house still smoking is just too much.So maybe the old Hollywood epic historical movies didn't look so realistic (actors were clean and had white teeth), but Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks were so much more fun to look at, because they didn't take it all too seriously.

Since then black-and-white has been used very sparingly; even Polanski's `Chinatown', obviously conceived as homage to the films noirs of the 1940s and 1950s, was shot in colour.`Raging Bull'- a biography of the boxer Jake La Motta who for a time held the world middleweight championship- is one of the few exceptions. The use of black-and-white seems to have been inspired by the fact that the film depicts real-life events that occurred in the forties and fifties. Scorsese has tried to capture the look of both the films and the newsreels of that period. This is remarkably effective for the boxing scenes, which have a raw, brutal power and graphically depict the aggressive nature of the sport. The other remarkable thing about the film is the performance of Robert de Niro, for which he won a well-deserved Best Actor Academy Award. De Niro actually learned to box for the film, and did all the boxing scenes himself without using a stunt double, but his portrayal of La Motta's private life is equally effective.Some boxers- Henry Cooper comes to mind- are hard-hitting inside the ring but gentlemanly and restrained outside. La Motta, as portrayed in this film, did not fall into this category. De Niro portrays him as a man with a very short fuse, seething with anger and violence. Unlike his great rival Sugar Ray Robinson, an elegant practitioner of the art of boxing, La Motta tries to overpower his rivals with brute force rather than relying on skill. His aggression is not something confined to the ring, but rather an inherent part of his personality, and comes out in his dealings with others. He treats his beautiful wife Vicki particularly badly, frequently (and irrationally) suspecting her of infidelity and subjecting her to both verbal and physical abuse. Besides De Niro's dominating performance, there are also very good contributions from Cathy Moriarty as Vicki and from Joe Pesci as La Motta's loyal brother Joey, another frequent target of abuse despite his loyalty.For me, this is a very good film, yet one that falls just short of the classic status that some have claimed for it. At times it is enthralling to watch, but at others, particularly in the first half, it seems to lack structure, as La Motta takes on a series of opponents without the significance of these fights ever becoming clear. More could have been made of the gambling-inspired corruption that infested the sport at this period and which may well have contributed to La Motta's sense of frustration- at one time it is made clear to him that his getting a chance to fight for the world title depends upon his taking a dive in a non-title fight. The main weakness, however, is a sense of emptiness at its centre, resulting from the lack of a character who can engage our sympathies. As I said, it is De Niro's performance that dominates the film, but for all his fine acting, even he cannot make us sympathise with a drunken, self-pitying, paranoid, violent wife-beater. As a character study of an unpleasant character it is excellent, but it can go no further than that. I cannot agree that this is the greatest film of the eighties; indeed, for me it was not even the greatest sporting film of the eighties. (I preferred both `Chariots of Fire' and `Eight Men Out').

This is remarkably effective for the boxing scenes, which have a raw, brutal power and graphically depict the aggressive nature of the sport. The other remarkable thing about the film is the performance of Robert de Niro, for which he won a well-deserved Best Actor Academy Award. De Niro actually learned to box for the film, and did all the boxing scenes himself without using a stunt double, but his portrayal of La Motta's private life is equally effective.Some boxers- Henry Cooper comes to mind- are hard-hitting inside the ring but gentlemanly and restrained outside. La Motta, as portrayed in this film, did not fall into this category. De Niro portrays him as a man with a very short fuse, seething with anger and violence. Unlike his great rival Sugar Ray Robinson, an elegant practitioner of the art of boxing, La Motta tries to overpower his rivals with brute force rather than relying on skill. His aggression is not something confined to the ring, but rather an inherent part of his personality, and comes out in his dealings with others. He treats his beautiful wife Vicki particularly badly, frequently (and irrationally) suspecting her of infidelity and subjecting her to both verbal and physical abuse. Besides De Niro's dominating performance, there are also very good contributions from Cathy Moriarty as Vicki and from Joe Pesci as La Motta's loyal brother Joey, another frequent target of abuse despite his loyalty.For me, this is a very good film, yet one that falls just short of the classic status that some have claimed for it. At times it is enthralling to watch, but at others, particularly in the first half, it seems to lack structure, as La Motta takes on a series of opponents without the significance of these fights ever becoming clear. More could have been made of the gambling-inspired corruption that infested the sport at this period and which may well have contributed to La Motta's sense of frustration- at one time it is made clear to him that his getting a chance to fight for the world title depends upon his taking a dive in a non-title fight. The main weakness, however, is a sense of emptiness at its centre, resulting from the lack of a character who can engage our sympathies. As I said, it is De Niro's performance that dominates the film, but for all his fine acting, even he cannot make us sympathise with a drunken, self-pitying, paranoid, violent wife-beater. As a character study of an unpleasant character it is excellent, but it can go no further than that. I cannot agree that this is the greatest film of the eighties; indeed, for me it was not even the greatest sporting film of the eighties. (I preferred both `Chariots of Fire' and `Eight Men Out'). It is an easy film to admire, but a difficult one to love. 7\/10.

And the soundtrack too is one of the most memorable in Disney's canon. I believe this is the first time they've based its score around the pre-existing songs of a familiar artist - in this case the immortal Elvis Presley. Needless to say, it's great music.(Sadly, we also had to tolerate the likes of Gareth Gates and A Teens doing sugary covers over the end credits, but at this stage you can always switch off or leave the cinema.)Too bad that Disney are now really on the wane, or they could have tried doing these themed soundtracks more often with the Beatles and Pink Floyd...oh well, I can dream.To sum up, Stitch is the best.

Unfortunately, there are a number of inaccuracies in Ike's story, and when Maggie complains about these he is fired by his boss (who also happens to be his ex-wife). In order to vindicate his reputation, Ike travels to the small town where Maggie lives to track her down and find out the facts.What happens next is- well, I won't write a spoiler. In fact, I don't need to write a spoiler. Anyone familiar with the conventions of romantic comedy will be able to work out what happens next. And what happens after that. And after that. After watching about the first half-hour (make that the first quarter of an hour) of this film, I was able to work out virtually the whole of the plot, including the ending. I knew how a chess grandmaster must feel when he realises that he can predict not only the next move but also the next few moves his weaker opponent will make.Predictability is not necessarily a bad thing in a romantic comedy. As another reviewer on this board has pointed out, it is a highly conventional genre and its conventions can almost be summed up by an 'a + b + c = d' mathematical formula. We know in advance that there will be a happy ending; what makes the film interesting or dull is the route that it takes to reach that ending.Unfortunately, the route taken by 'Runaway Bride' is a dull one. The main problem is the character of Maggie. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, to jilt one potential husband at the altar may be a misfortune, to do it twice looks like carelessness and to do it three times or more suggests serious emotional problems. Now the scriptwriters are obviously well aware that emotional disturbance is not generally regarded as a suitable subject for lighthearted comedy, so no real attempt is made to explain her behaviour; it is presented as an eccentric trait of an otherwise normal and likable personality. The result was that Maggie failed to come alive, and even an actress as experienced at romantic comedy as Julia Roberts could do little with her.Richard Gere as Ike did not help matters either. He is a talented actor, but can also be a lazy one who fails to put much of himself into his characters, and Ike came across as amiable but not very interesting. The newspaper he works for, USA Today, is a real one, but I wonder how happy they were with this experiment in product placement. It cannot do much for their reputation to suggest that they would ever have employed a reporter as sloppy as Ike (or an editor as difficult to work for as the former Mrs Graham) in the first place. None of the other characters stood out either. Maggie's disappointed suitors all seemed too nice and their total lack of jealousy or resentment at her behaviour was unrealistic.Unlike some who have reviewed this film, I have nothing against either romantic comedy as such, or Julia Roberts, or even romantic comedies starring Julia Roberts. (I enjoyed 'America's Sweethearts', 'Notting Hill' and - yes!- 'Pretty Woman' much more). I did, however, have a problem with this film- the characters were unconvincing and the script was flat and lacking in wit or humour. 5\/10.

Some might call him a pervert. Others call him a patriot. I believe he is the latter. While I don't know the exact story of Larry Flynt from any other sources than this movie, I don't know if it's completely accurate. The plot is great, for a biographic piece, the acting is superb, by most actors, especially the three main characters. Most of the cinematography fits the movie perfectly. The only thing that bothered me a little, was there was relatively little information about why Larry Flynt did what he did, believed what he believed so strongly. I sympathized with his character in several scenes, but I never fully understood him. The director should have had at least a few more emotional scenes with Larry, to explain his actions better. Overall, a very good drama. Recommendable to most fans of the genre, as long as they can stand what the movie shows them.

His view ratings are dropping dramatically and the bosses have all agreed to cut him loose, all but Max Schumacher, the head of the news broadcasting, who is an old friend of Howard. After hearing of his forced retirement he decides to say goodbye in a different way during his last 'performance' on TV he, instead of reading the news, informs the viewer he's going to commit suicide. The bosses of UBS are furious, but a newcomer and professional b*tch Diana Christensen sees a great commercial hit in this new way of dealing with the news today.This main story forms the base of a magical dark comedy and drama picture directed by Sidney Lumet. A star cast filled with established actors received in 1977 the important prices at the Academy Awards, winning both the Oscar for best leading actor, won by Peter Finch in his role of the exuberant television prophet Howard Beale and the Oscar for best leading actress, won by Faye Dunaway, playing the professional business women, creating a prototype of modern television. Somehow Beatrice Straight even won the award for best female supporting actress, as the aging woman of Max Schumacher. Besides these, you got William Holden (Max Schumacher), Robert Duvall (Frank Hachett) and Ned Beatty as Arthur Jensen, all in good form.Apart from the terrific acting the movie delivers a great, but dramatic story of the evolution of the media system into a real killer machine (signified by Dunaway's character). In the beginning the story is quite funny and entertaining but when Howard has his first strike, you know this is more than a game, it's reality, just like Howard prophecies. Then the channel gets more and more aggravated, the public is aroused and evil has won the war, 'cause that's what the media has become a bloody battle for money. The last shot of the film, when Howard has been shot by the communist revolutionaries (I even recognized Tim Robbins as one of the shooters), is bitter and absolutely horrifying. The prophecy has become reality.This weird mix of comedy and drama is just the way I feel about modern television I can laugh with it because of its stupidity, but on the other hand it is sad that more than a half of the population of my country (Belgium) is watching this crap. The comedy of the movie is sometimes achieved in tiny things. I love the fact that Howard is from the start of the picture on saying he's going to kill self because of the system, but in the end it is the system that kills him. Powerful filming and strong acting create a bitter good film. Just go and rent or even buy this one!
