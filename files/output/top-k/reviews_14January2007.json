Kelley wrote the script for Gillian, it's flaws seem to have made a bit more sense for while I've rarely been privy to such notable TV shows like The Practice, Boston Legal, and Chicago Hope, it became clear that writing dramas that don't pertain to law or medicine isn't his forte and the result is a film in which no elements really work.Of the seven primary characters in Gillian, only three really matter David (Peter Gallagher), a man who, after two years, still isn't over the death of his wife Gillian (Michelle Pfieffer); Rachel (Clare Danes), his daughter, whose relationship with her father isn't too estranged; and Esther (Kathy Baker), David's sister-in-law, who's determined to remove Rachel from David's care for fear it is unhealthy for the girl. The remaining characters bring little substance to the film. Paul (Bruce Altman), Esther's husband, is aware of his wife's intentions and quietly tolerates his them despite objections while simultaneously voicing his sexual frustrations in the presence of young beautiful women such as Cindy (Laurie Fortier), Rachel's friend, who's equally frustrated and so bored that she uses her sex appeal to taunt men for fun. Kevin (Wendy Crewson), is an acquaintance of Esther and Paul's who was brought by them (unbeknownst to her and David) to the family's gathering for no other reason than to take David's mind off Gillian. Upon this realization, Kevin learns that her presence is unneeded despite being amiably tolerated (at best) by everyone else, especially Esther, who spends much of the first half of the film using Kevin as her pawn to convince David to get over Gillian. Fortunately, Kevin's knowledge that she's unneeded dissuades her from doing anything more than just being present throughout the film. Finally, there's Gillian who appears as an apparition just to remind us of how un-over her David really is and that Rachel comes first,.The basic conflict of the story lies in Esther's belief that David's perpetual grief has made him an unsuitable parent for Rachel, which she bases solely on a slip in Rachel's grades. Rachel doesn't think so, which is why she defends her father. But the conflict for viewers revolves around Esther, who cannot sympathize at all with David's grief which pertains entirely to the death of her sister! What is wrong with this woman that she's adamant about about speeding up his grief process by threatening to take his daughter away from him despite proclaiming to care for him and not sparing a moment of heartache for the loss of her sister? We never find out and after a night during which Rachel goes to bed drunk and has a nightmare featuring Gillian, the conflict is resolved when Rachel decides to go live with Esther and Paul and let her mother be dead,. Further (and most predictable) resolution occurs during the final 10 minutes when David decides to get over Gillian, move in the Paul and Esther, and start putting Rachel first. It's far too little too late.Since Gillian does contain a good cast with a notable performance from Danes, I gave it four out of ten stars but the talents of these people are ultimately lost in this poorly written melodrama that might elicit some tears and sighs from the audience, but is mostly a film about a rivalry between in-laws that is devoid of the compassion usually felt after the death of a loved one.P.S. By the way, David E. Kelley, stick to televised legal and medical dramas. Your talents and know-how as a writer and producer are most obvious and bankable in those fields.

In Mario Puzo's GODFATHER, we had the headless horse.In all seriousness, there is only one other movie I have given a perfect 10 to so far, and that's TORA TORA TORA. It took me a while to appreciate this movie. The first time I saw GODFATHER, I saw more blood and gore than I remember ever seeing in any movie before, though it's pretty tame by today's standards. My mind wandered quite a bit during it and I came out of there kind of glad it was over. Then, several months later, I heard the soundtrack and I liked it so much, I thought I would give this movie another chance. It has come to be my all time favorite movie. And the music is still great. The mellow, folklike soundtrack provides a nice balance to the violence that goes on throughout the movie.Francis Ford Coppola is faithful to the book and tells the story very well. Watching the way certain scenes are set up is like watching the workings of a fine Swiss watch, it is that good. It gives depth and insight into the workings of the Mafia that no other movie before or since ever has. The point of view this story is told in is controversial, ie, they give you possible justifications for some of the things they do, and it almost makes you sympathize with the characters. The most telling lines in the story is when Michael comes back after hiding out in Sicily for the murder of a police officer and a bigshot in a rival family. He is talking to Kay, telling her he has decided to go into business with his father, and tells her that his father is no different than anyone else who is responsible for people's welfare, like a Congressman or President. Kay states that is naive because Congressmen and Presidents don't have people killed. Michael then fixes her with that patented stare (Al Pacino was perfect in this role) and says, Who's being naive, Kay? That is a very chilling moment, as is Michael's transformation from wholesome American war hero to the head of one of the most powerful Mafia families in the country. Another telling moment is when Michael meets with his father in the garden and they are discussing business strategies, and the Don says, I don't apologize for my life. I did what I had to to protect my family, and I refused to be a fool for those pezzanovante who were holding the strings.

In this story, Susan had a truly insignificant role in the French Resistance in World War II; and she briefly had a lover. With the war over, she has a solidly good life in England, married to a fine man, a diplomat, a life with advantages many would envy. IF ONLY... if only she could eradicate her past, if only she could erase her dreams, if only she could find fulfillment in her husband's success rather than her own. Of course many people are shallow enough to do exactly that. Or do they? What secret desires lie in the hearts of each of us? It's easy for the audience to dislike Susan; after all, she pretty well can't stand herself, so why should WE like her, or care about her? Maybe we see a real part of ourselves in her; the part we keep quiet about. Hush! It's my secret.

And it doesn't even seem like he's trying (actually, a lot of his method is to let his actors do their thing, while seamlessly being the intricate voyeur and conductor in the editing room), even when he makes what might be his most striking achievement yet, at least in his 'multi-layered' film area of work. It's staggering in part because of how he defies the ideals of having a normal 'balance' with the narrative. In fact, his film could be considered in a sense a masterpiece of contradictions. It celebrates thumb-nosing at the system and the parts of the counter-culture and sexual revolution and the disgust at rhetoric in politics, while still trying to reach for some level of worth and pride in this country. There's moments of nuance and detail and little emotional notes that will probably need a repeat viewing (or more) to totally grasp, while also encapsulating what is an archetypal Altman-esquire film with lots and lots of things going on in scenes, with the spontaneity of life bouncing around the conversations and characters and big crowds. It's grandiose and epic, somber and uproariously funny, and it leaves at the end the feeling that this country should be loved while also criticized to hell.Any other director might collapse at trying to achieve so much as what is done in Nashville, but Altman accomplishes it because of not just his own intuition and grace with his style- and I've rarely seen his style so attuned to an aesthetic that works for the material (in a sense documentary, but with the gravitas of drama)- but with his sprawling cast. We get all kinds of personalities, as opposed to direct 'stories', all in this small city in Tennessee where country music reigns and southern accents aren't hard to come by. There's a mother of two deaf boys, Linnea Reese (Lily Tomlin), who also sings in a gospel choir and may have a mail suitor trying to court her even as she's married to a Mr. Reese (Ned Beatty). He is the sort of assistant to a political consultant (Michael Murphy), or at least how he appears to be, when he's also not trying to look after his interests for his politician in town. There's also the galley of female singers, including Sueleen Gay (Gwen Welles at the peak of her powers), who can't sing well, and Barbara Jean (Ronee Blakley), who sings very well, but is in the hospital for a spell after collapsing, and may or may not have a couple of screw-looses. Still, she is somehow the most cherished country singer around.Meanwhile, a BBC reporter (Geraldine Chaplin, a candidate for consistently funniest oddball of the lot) who roams around, a man who is easy as the song literally goes takes his pick of women (Carradine, in a class-act of a 'hunky' performance), a very successful singer tries to keep the balance of things all musical in Nashville (Henry Gibson, with killer sideburns), and others like a tricycle freak (Jeff Goldbum, hilariously funny with those glasses) and a wanderer (Shelley Duvall) make up the patchwork. There's also a very strong performance, one of my favorites, by the control-freak husband of Barbara Jean (Allan Garfield), who loves her and cant stand to see her crumble- just like the audience, to an extent. All the while these characters are 'woven' together- for lack of a better expression- into what Nashville is, which has no real story to speak of, but really doesn't need one, in all reality because, frankly, Altman's getting down reality minute by minute. It might sometimes be absurd or bleak or crude, but it's a kind of reality nonetheless that bares probably little relation to the script (hence the documentary feel).But most of this would seem trite if the music didn't work either, and it's here that the idea of America's tragic, lovely, fun and oddly uplifting moments all in one package. It also helps that the country music, more often than not, is loaded with classic melodies and singing- and this is coming from someone who usually can't stand country music- particularly the song that's played by Keith Carradine and his two friends up on-stage *before* I'm Easy, Barbara Jean's songs, and at least one of the bits from Henry Gibson. There's always a sense with the 'good-old' American music that it conveys messages and meanings for us that wouldn't be totally recognized otherwise, if only in inflection and voice and lyric and such (not to get too preachy about it). And somehow it connects where a lot of times politics or relationships just cannot, which then adds that extra layer of bittersweet (more for the bitter) with what happens at the end at the show with Barbara Jean, and the final song It Don't Worry Me. Everything combines together, and the detail and various conversations with characters become illuminated more by the persistent, engrossing use of zooms and delicate pans on the characters. All Altman needs is that little note from the camera on the actor, and for the actor to be right there, and it works wonders. Filled with abrasive notes of symbolism, including an opening wink at the audience involving the soundtrack, and pitch-perfect moments, this is one of the great 70s films, and one of the top high-points of the late director's career.

Well, I think his path down the road of controversy begins here, with 1947's Gentleman's Agreement.The term gentleman's agreement means an unwritten rule which basically states that Jews are not permitted to patronize businesses, get jobs, or find a place to live, simply because they're Jewish. Author Laura Z. Hobson tackled the issue with a story she was sure would never sell. To everyone's surprise, it did sell, and it did open eyes, and Darryl F.

They wanted the subject to remain quiet, so no feathers could get ruffled. All that did was press the project forward, with the keeping it quiet topic addressed in an early scene of the film itself.

This is far too intelligent for you.Fans of Kubrick's films, stay away. This is not intelligent enough for you.Fans of TV soap operas, you should give this one a try.This time, Bergman's script is nothing less than exhilarating. The story is absolutely amazing.Ingrid visits her daughter Liv. They talk. Liv's cripple sister, Lena, appears. Ingrid talks to Lena. Ingrid talks to herself. Liv talks to her husband. They talk to Ingrid. Liv plays the piano. Ingrid plays the piano. Liv and Ingrid talk. And they talk. Flashbacks. After a while they talk more. Flashbacks. And guess what? They talk again. And again. Flashbacks. Lena screams. Liv narrates, thinking about suicide. Ingrid on a train, happy to finally leave the movie. Liv narrates more. Guess how the movie ends? Liv talks. To the camera, this time. She has bored Ingrid so much that the cameraman was the only person left to talk to at the end.If your idea of fun is to watch a mother and a daughter confront their inner demons and their troubled past (as some critics would probably put it), then you'll enjoy this piece of crap. A soap opera, nothing more, but with better dialog. Except that this time around the acting is worse than usual. Liv is unconvincing; screaming and tamper-tantrums do not necessarily good acting make. Ingrid is a little better, but she completely destroys the illusion she creates of being a good actress when we hear her speaking English in 3-4 scenes. It is when we hear English spoken here that we get a glimpse into how much worse Bergman films would sound if they were in a language we could understand. As it is, Bergman, quite wisely, hides behind Swedish (he could have easily made more English-speaking movies). When we hear Ingrid in Swedish we don't notice how silly some of the dialog really is. I mean, it's still silly, but not as silly as when you can actually understand it directly.This oppressive, overwrought drama has all the Bergman traits flashbacks, marathon dialogs, marathon monologues, reddish\/brown colours that dominate, unresolved issues between family members, shouting, misery, wretchedness &#x96; and even a crippled person this time. I've always considered it a very cheap dramatic shtick to put a crippled person into the story, sort of under the motto if I can't get 'em to cry with the other stuff, surely a cripple will get the tears rolling. Check out the truly pathetic scene when Lena is crawling on the floor, shouting Mama!. I mean, it's so damn manipulative that it can only work with uncritical or inexperienced viewers.Plot-wise, Bergman really lays on the misery. Not only is Liv scarred for life by her mother's cold behaviour, but she also has a cripple sister. And her health has been worsening steadily for years. And Liv thinks about suicide. And she and her husband couldn't have children for a long time. And if you think that was enough for Bergman, you're wrong you see, Liv eventually gave birth to a son, but alas, he's dead. And he was just a child, of course, when he died. Of course. So basically, the only disaster Bergman didn't include was the sky falling on everyone's collective heads.I found it rather pretentious (you can't have a(n honest) Bergman review without this word) how Bergman keeps throwing in all those names of classical composers, and their works. It's sort of his way of saying, see? I listen to classical music, and these are my favourite pieces of it. As if anyone cares what he listens to. You're an educated, cultured ex-Nazi, we get it.There is an endless scene with Liv and Ingrid that lasts about 20 minutes (if I'm not mistaken).

This is far too intelligent for you.Fans of Kubrick's films, stay away. This is not intelligent enough for you.Fans of TV soap operas, you should give this one a try.This time, Bergman's script is nothing less than exhilarating. The story is absolutely amazing.Ingrid visits her daughter Liv. They talk. Liv's cripple sister, Lena, appears. Ingrid talks to Lena. Ingrid talks to herself. Liv talks to her husband. They talk to Ingrid. Liv plays the piano. Ingrid plays the piano. Liv and Ingrid talk. And they talk. Flashbacks. After a while they talk more. Flashbacks. And guess what? They talk again. And again. Flashbacks. Lena screams. Liv narrates, thinking about suicide. Ingrid on a train, happy to finally leave the movie. Liv narrates more. Guess how the movie ends? Liv talks. To the camera, this time. She has bored Ingrid so much that the cameraman was the only person left to talk to at the end.If your idea of fun is to watch a mother and a daughter confront their inner demons and their troubled past (as some critics would probably put it), then you'll enjoy this piece of crap. A soap opera, nothing more, but with better dialog. Except that this time around the acting is worse than usual. Liv is unconvincing; screaming and tamper-tantrums do not necessarily good acting make. Ingrid is a little better, but she completely destroys the illusion she creates of being a good actress when we hear her speaking English in 3-4 scenes. It is when we hear English spoken here that we get a glimpse into how much worse Bergman films would sound if they were in a language we could understand. As it is, Bergman, quite wisely, hides behind Swedish (he could have easily made more English-speaking movies). When we hear Ingrid in Swedish we don't notice how silly some of the dialog really is. I mean, it's still silly, but not as silly as when you can actually understand it directly.This oppressive, overwrought drama has all the Bergman traits flashbacks, marathon dialogs, marathon monologues, reddish\/brown colours that dominate, unresolved issues between family members, shouting, misery, wretchedness &#x96; and even a crippled person this time. I've always considered it a very cheap dramatic shtick to put a crippled person into the story, sort of under the motto if I can't get 'em to cry with the other stuff, surely a cripple will get the tears rolling. Check out the truly pathetic scene when Lena is crawling on the floor, shouting Mama!. I mean, it's so damn manipulative that it can only work with uncritical or inexperienced viewers.Plot-wise, Bergman really lays on the misery. Not only is Liv scarred for life by her mother's cold behaviour, but she also has a cripple sister. And her health has been worsening steadily for years. And Liv thinks about suicide. And she and her husband couldn't have children for a long time. And if you think that was enough for Bergman, you're wrong you see, Liv eventually gave birth to a son, but alas, he's dead. And he was just a child, of course, when he died. Of course. So basically, the only disaster Bergman didn't include was the sky falling on everyone's collective heads.I found it rather pretentious (you can't have a(n honest) Bergman review without this word) how Bergman keeps throwing in all those names of classical composers, and their works. It's sort of his way of saying, see? I listen to classical music, and these are my favourite pieces of it. As if anyone cares what he listens to. You're an educated, cultured ex-Nazi, we get it.There is an endless scene with Liv and Ingrid that lasts about 20 minutes (if I'm not mistaken).

I went in seeing this film without ever reading (or having any knowledge of) the award-winning novel that the film is apparently very tightly based upon. Even without that, this film was amazing. The movie begins with a woman named Sethe (Oprah Winfrey), a former slave living in 1800s Cincinatti, where an unseen presence is tearing apart her house, throwing things against the walls, and injuring her dog. Her two sons ultimately run away, terrified of the house, and her youngest daughter, Denver is forced to stay. Cut to eight years later, a friend of Sethe's, Paul D. (Danny Glover) reenters her life and moves in with Sethe. We got a ghost here, Denver tells him, and Paul D. mentions feeling an evil presence in her house, but Sethe tells him it's only sadness. Then later on, a mysterious young woman who calls herself Beloved is found standing in the front yard of the house. She can barely speak, can't move, and is almost like an infant in the body of a teenager. But who is she, where did she come from, and why is she there? Sethe's dark past holds the secret to Beloved's identity, which is revealed later on in the film.Beloved isn't a horror film, and I wasn't expecting one either. Granted, there are a few disturbing scenes (and a handful of rather scary moments), but this film is a drama more than anything and really focuses more on it's characters. The story itself is an interesting one at that, and after seeing this I'm tempted to go read the novel (which I hear the film is adapted to very closely). Everything in the film seems to be put together very nicely, and (unlike many people who claim to not be able to follow the story) I followed it very easily. There are some harsh themes that are a consistent part of the plot (mainly Sethe's horrible past as an abused slave) and there are some scenes that are truly hard to watch. While the supernatural element is a main theme in the movie, this isn't your average ghost story. It's not horrific or in-your-face, it's a much lighter and touching. I don't want to go too in-depth into the plot, because there are things that I could easily spoil and wouldn't want to - see the film for yourself. Character development is rampant in the film, and each of the characters mature in a different way throughout the course of the movie, and makes for some very interesting viewing as each of them grow in different ways.Performances are amazing from everyone involved. I'd never seen Oprah Winfrey act, I'd just seen her television talk-show a few times, but she proves in this film that she can (and very well too). Danny Glover also gives a very nice performance but it's overshadowed by the rest of the cast. Thandie Newton plays Beloved, and plays it perfectly - her character is mysterious and obscure, and she does it well. Kimberly Elise plays Sethe's daughter, Denver, and plays the character excellently. I can't say anything bad about the acting in any aspects - to sum it up as a whole, the acting here is just flat-out amazing. Along with the wonderful acting, the directing is great also. Academy Award winner Jonathan Demme (who also directed the award winning crime-suspense masterpiece The Silence of the Lambs) handles the story well and keeps things consistently absorbing and ultimately haunting. Very nice cinematography is present too, and there are tons of symbolic images throughout the film that are placed nicely in the mix, along with a lot of shots of nature and wildlife.Overall, Beloved is an amazing movie, and the people who are rating this as a '1\/10' must have not seen very many movies, because this film is so far from a '1' that it's not even funny. Don't let the average user rating scare you off from this film, because it really deserves much better than that.

Only Copycat and Sisters manage to be more annoying in their absurdity, and only Saw is worse. And it's a pity because the first hour is genuinely eerie, with a fittingly claustrophobic mortuary as the ideal setting. I am a very jaded viewer, but some of those early mortuary scenes really get under your skin. However, after an hour it all goes downhill, and I mean steeply. The relentlessly stupid plot twists rob you of all patience and the movie just keeps sinking to new lows. All logic is thrown into the wind, and the viewer's intelligence is insulted and pounded upon repeatedly with more force than that baseball bat could ever have generated - the one used by Nolte and McGregor. (I'd be the first to sign up if they were looking for volunteers to take that baseball bat and bash the heads of the writers of this nonsense.) Nothing here adds up. Absolutely nothing. Nolte was molesting corpses decades earlier and the writers of this film would have us believe that this man could years later become the city's chief police investigator! Making him the killer is as absurd as giving Thomas Edison credit for inventing the wheel, as laughable as a conspiracy-theory plot from the X-Files, and as stupid as Kim Basinger's book on how to solve all of world's problems (if she'd ever write one). The very notion that a man - so disturbed that he indulges in necrophilia in mortuaries - would have the sanity, interest, patience, and willingness to climb all the way to chief investigator in a police department only to start a savage murder spree is simply a mind-bogglingly dumb, far-fetched concept to me.And how the hell did he even start with the framing of McGregor? This is an essential piece of the puzzle that is badly missing here; McGregor JUST HAPPENS to get a job where he meets Nolte. And McGregor's best friend, Brolin, JUST HAPPENS to know a prostitute who is Nolte's play toy (and later victim). It can sure be a small, small world in a Hollywood stinker! And to add some silliness, Brolin is some kind of a deranged thrill-seeker who acts like a total lunatic all the time. Obviously, he is the decoy for the viewer; we are meant to treat him as the suspect. But how dumb do they think we are? And how the hell did Brolin get into the mortuary when he carried out his practical joke? And how the hell did Nolte manage to drag out a body of one of his victims within seconds of McGregor entering the room, without McGregor noticing it (the fact that he had his walkman on and\/or was singing and\/or talking doesn't make it any more believable)? And what's with this annoying scene where Arquette JUST HAPPENS to walk into the mortuary at exactly the moment when McGregor is hitting Nolte with a baseball bat and predictably starts thinking her boyfriend is the killer??! More annoyances came from the scene in which Brolin's reaction to McGregor's telling him that the latter is been suspected of murder is to laugh! Or the one in which he cuts off his own thumb in order to free himself and save the others. Sure,... why not?? (I am being hand-cuffed to this metal pole, and as a result can neither save my friends nor myself... What do I do...? I know!... I'll cut my thumb off! How come I didn't think of that before!?...) Nolte makes the best out of his role, but due to the bitchingly silly script he appears to be hamming it up too much at the end - but what choice did he have?

There are two scenes in which he gets the crap beaten out of him, which gives frustrated viewers some satisfaction, after enduring over two hours of his nasty, nihilistic attitudinizing.That said, the character Johnny, though basically a total asshole, is not entirely unsympathetic, though he comes close. After a while, you begin to realize that he's a severely damaged human being, whose ugly behavior toward others, especially women, is a reflection of the ugliness around him. He may be mentally ill, though I don't think so. He certainly is physically ill, to the point that many viewers believe that he may very well be dying, which would make sense of some of the more extreme things he says and does.He is capable of unexpected generosity at times, such as when he essentially manages to reunite the young Scottish couple who have gotten separated in an unfamiliar city. In a more conventional movie, he would eventually be revealed to be a nice guy after all, a bad guy with a heart of gold. We get indications of abuse and neglect in his background, which have helped make him the bitter misanthrope he is, but there are occasional hints that he could have turned out a lot better. What's ambiguous is that he seems to have more or less chosen to be the obnoxious person he is, with no real effort at being a better human being. The appalling character of the creepy landlord, who is in many ways a smoother, affluent version of Johnny, is so much more despicable, that Johnny almost looks good by contrast.I think he is in the movie to indicate that even Johnny isn't totally beyond redemption, if such a vile man could exist, who's even worse.The acting by all the cast is excellent. The women are a pretty sad lot, which is a source of many complaints against this movie, but they are all quite believable. The film is full of lonely, emotionally crippled individuals, lost in a bleak modern world that offers little hope for the future.

In my opinion it is Stone's best work along with Wall Street and Natural Born Killers.Every time i hear part of the sound track from the movie i get a cold chill down my spine. It's the music that comes on as they leave that village. Over all it more than deserved to win a best picture Oscar.
