Spielberg's main goal with this film was to create the reality of war, the horror, the fear, the gore, the devastation.  He succeeded on all counts.  The action sequences were nothing short of incredible, very realistic and frightening.  But unfortunately, I think that Speilberg's desire to create the most visually powerful war film of all time was overpowering his ability to tell a good story.The story was not a very good one.  The story is the heart and soul of a film and it cannot be compromised for the sake of expressing the strictly visual component of that story.  Not only was it completely unbelievable that the US army would send out a group of soldiers in search of one man in the middle of war but the whole movie you are just waiting for another battle to take place.  It kind of reminded me a bit of the movie, Twister. Of course, it was much better than Twister as a whole but it had a similar structure, good action interrupted by a bad story.  All of the performances are fantastic (and that makes the story watchable, unlike Twister) and some of the Rodat's writing is good (Like Matt Damon's back home speech) but the film's visual presentation of war is just so enthralling that no story could probably match it.  It is the downfall of any movie which has a much more talented director than screenwriter.That doesn't mean to say that that combination of writer\/director can't work. I believe that Face\/Off had a pretty unbelieveable story but John Woo's ability to intergrate the visuals of the film into the story itself and tell the crazy story so matter-a-factly makes it work.  Spielberg didn't seem to take as much interest in the progression of the narrative as he did into the progression of the battle scene. And ultimately, this makes the film stagnate quite frequently.I still believe the film to be worthy of Best Picture, Cinematography, Editing and a number of technical awards. I don't think that it deserves to win Best Director or Screenplay (but it mostly still will win).  The chemistry that is essential to making a story work was not there and that holds the film back from being a complete masterpiece. If you want to watch WWII film which incorporates both good writing and good direction watch Terrence Malik's The Thin Red Line (it at least has a better balance of the two).  Still watch Saving Private Ryan, just don't expect to start crying  for the characters and their conflict, but expect to cringe in your seats at the horrors of war which Speilberg brings to the screen with incredible authenticity and realism.

Personally, I see that both Forrest Gump (FG) and TSR as the same standard of excellence. Both movies shows contrasting aspects of hope and how to adjust to injustices in the outside world. What made FG a classic and probably gave it the best picture Oscar was not only the special effects throughout the movie, or the brilliant appropriate use of music fitting the era, but the incredible acting and plot device. When I first saw FG I thought it was a good family comedy with immense amounts of surrealism. However after repeat viewing I realised that FG had one of the most thought provoking scripts ever committed to film. There are so many aspects of the storyline that has never left me ever since I saw the movie almost five years ago. Just like Life is Beautiful there is the external and internal images and story in this picture. The external is a family comedy that will make you laugh as many things seem so outrageous. However internally, FG is a movie about drug addiction, child sexual abuse, a true sacrificial love story with one way traffic, how a person can cope with disability without committing suicide, the nature of God when something terrible happens to you, prostitution and so much more besides. Tell me one other movie that can handle these subjects and still make you laugh throughout while telling you important moral lessons?Unlike other so called romance movies like Titanic, FG was not based on lust rather an understanding and fidelity of other persons' characters. If Forrest Gump is a bit dumb he makes up for it with his saint like character. What made this movie tragic is the long time span in which Forrest is in love with his girl and would do almost anything for her and yet she disrespects him because he is mentally disabled, he is not 'normal'. Yet the people Jenny hangs around with are spiritually and morally 'abnormal'. If people can't relate to this maybe it is beyond their understanding and comprehension as they have never been in that position.Forrest may not be able to verbalise the meaning of love, but his actions put 'normal' people to shame and some. Where else in a modern film do you see the hero being rejected by a gril or even genuinely wanting to get married, only in the old classics I suppose!! Forrest always has the hope of a better future, he teaches the audience that you should always have an aim to look forward to and that will help to keep you sane under misfortune, even if it's simply running down the road to owning a business. In addition, the movie shows that no matter what your disability you can still make a contribution to society and other people's lives. If this is not a powerful message I have never seen or heard one. Forrest knows that Jenny is the only girl he has got a chance with to be his wife, which makes the story even sadder as we see Jenny living a life on the edge. Even at the ending we are unsure whether Forrest is really looking after his son, but as long it is Jenny's and she is his,  he does not mind. Maybe this is a blind type of love, but he also loves Jenny like a biblical prodigal sister and he does not realise that he may have AIDS too. However FG gives hope to many millions of people around the world who are disabled and feel socially excluded in society. As the years roll by I still think about this movie which shows aspects of life which are heart wretchingly profound if you look beyond the external window.

If Sebastian can't seduce her as he says, than Kathryn gets his hot little car, but if he wins he gets Kathryn just as he has since he was a child.

She portrays the role of the updated, teen version Kathryn wonderfully. It is definitely the sharpest work she has done, and it is a completely different role than anything she has ever done before. In this film as a bitchy brunette, I really started to hate her which came as a surprise to me since I am a total Buffy fan. But the one scene in which she finally gets what she deserves I felt so bad for her saying, she doesn't deserve this, Sebastian does!I applaud Ryan Phillipe for being able to do his best performance while working with all these lovely ladies. Not once did I see him come out of character and him and fiance Reese Witherspoon worked perfectly together. Ms.Gellar and Ryan team up once more playing completely opposite characters from their roles in I Know....

","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"8 March 1999","score":"","review":"  For the longest time, I have been dying to see this film.  When I saw the trailer on I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, I was instantly hooked. It seemed like this year's Wild Things.  I love both films equally. Cruel Intentions is a very sexy and slick update of Dangerous Liaisons. Now, I haven't seen Dangerous Liaisons or the other versions, so I guess I can't give a full-fledged opinion.  However, this film had a great cast.Sarah Michelle Gellar went back to her All My Children days of playing a malicious character.  She oozes menace and sensuality beautifully.  Her style shined through her wardrobe, which was beautiful as well.  It was quite shocking how vulgar she was, compared to her character on Buffy The Vampire Slayer.  Whenever I think of her most classic line in the movie, (I want to f---!), I burst out in laughter because I could never have imagined those words coming out of her innocent, little mouth.  Her best scene was towards the end when she persuades Ryan Phillippe to do what she wants him to do.  I won't reveal what is he she makes him do, but the scene was all about power, control and sexuality.  She dominated on all three counts.Ryan Phillippe really impressed me in this film.  I'll never forget his innocent performance in White Squall, which was just as wonderful as this one.  I found him quite hilarious trying to act tough in I Know What You Did Last Summer being that I have only seen him in White Squall before. He was so-so in 54, but this role was more tailor-fit for him.  He was cunning, cool and intense in this picture and I hope this makes his career go further.  The best scenes in the film are between Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe.  They have progressed, dramatically, in their acting abilities since their previous outing together, I Know What You Did Last Summer.And Reese Witherspoon, I can never say enough about her.  She is such an amazing actress.  Her character in this film was the most rewarding and honestly portrayed.  I have been a fan ever since The Man In The Moon and an even bigger one with Fear and ESPECIALLY Freeway.  She is one of the best, versatile and most beautiful young actresses around.It's REALLY too bad that Joshua Jackson didn't have a bigger part in this movie because he has the most memorable line The only reason I let him keep up this charade is because the man has a mouth like a Hoover.

When I saw the trailer on I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, I was instantly hooked. It seemed like this year's Wild Things.  I love both films equally. Cruel Intentions is a very sexy and slick update of Dangerous Liaisons. Now, I haven't seen Dangerous Liaisons or the other versions, so I guess I can't give a full-fledged opinion.  However, this film had a great cast.Sarah Michelle Gellar went back to her All My Children days of playing a malicious character.  She oozes menace and sensuality beautifully.  Her style shined through her wardrobe, which was beautiful as well.  It was quite shocking how vulgar she was, compared to her character on Buffy The Vampire Slayer.  Whenever I think of her most classic line in the movie, (I want to f---!), I burst out in laughter because I could never have imagined those words coming out of her innocent, little mouth.  Her best scene was towards the end when she persuades Ryan Phillippe to do what she wants him to do.  I won't reveal what is he she makes him do, but the scene was all about power, control and sexuality.  She dominated on all three counts.Ryan Phillippe really impressed me in this film.  I'll never forget his innocent performance in White Squall, which was just as wonderful as this one.  I found him quite hilarious trying to act tough in I Know What You Did Last Summer being that I have only seen him in White Squall before. He was so-so in 54, but this role was more tailor-fit for him.  He was cunning, cool and intense in this picture and I hope this makes his career go further.  The best scenes in the film are between Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe.  They have progressed, dramatically, in their acting abilities since their previous outing together, I Know What You Did Last Summer.And Reese Witherspoon, I can never say enough about her.  She is such an amazing actress.  Her character in this film was the most rewarding and honestly portrayed.  I have been a fan ever since The Man In The Moon and an even bigger one with Fear and ESPECIALLY Freeway.  She is one of the best, versatile and most beautiful young actresses around.It's REALLY too bad that Joshua Jackson didn't have a bigger part in this movie because he has the most memorable line The only reason I let him keep up this charade is because the man has a mouth like a Hoover.

Taken from Shakespearean musings presented in Hamlet, act III, scene 1; it is not merely a look at what happens after  &#133;we have shuffled off this mortal coil&#133;, it is more of a profound look at his first question-To be or not to be&#133; and the nature of love.The answer to Hamlet's first question is obvious to the vast majority of the people, but for Annie Nielsen (Annabella Sciorra) it may not be so cut and dried.  Though she has found her soul-mate, the tragic death of her children rocks her to her very foundation.  Her husband, Dr. Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams), through exceptional love, understanding, and will, carries her back from the brink of insanity and suicide.  However, one of life's arrows of outrageous fortune strikes again taking Chris from her.Chris's new world is made up of the surreal images in the paintings he and Annie both love.  But her paintings and his heaven are each missing something-each other.  As she clings precariously to reality, Chris tries to reassure her from the beyond, and inadvertently, drives her over the edge to suicide.The heart of the film is here, for her suicide means she must spend eternity in hell.  It is not the hell of burning pitch and forked tailed devils, but the more insidious hell of self doubt, guilt, self-loathing, and the absence of love.  Chris's heaven will never be complete without Annie so he embarks on a journey to save her soul, knowing full well that it may cost his own. He leaves on his quest believing that his love for her now, as in life, will bring her back to his world.This movie could have degenerated down to a bunch of swell special effects that would have overpowered the story.  The effects in this film allow the story to cross worlds, giving insight to both Chris's and Annie's thoughts and providing a beautiful view of the their shared, perfect world.  The visions of hell are equally compelling with their grotesque horrors that on the surface provide a visceral terror to the undedicated that disguises the true nature of eternity as being without hope.Robin Williams performance is Oscar caliber.  His range of emotion, from delight to resolution to anguish and despair make the audience feel all of Chris's hopes and fears.  One can easily believe he is Chris.  Annabella Sciorra is equally believable as the ebullient young Annie as well as the despondent, suicidal, on-the-edge Annie.The movie is complex, has depth, and has a message about transcendent nature of true, unconditional love.  While the message is wholesome, the movie is too graphic in parts, and the subject matter too disturbing for younger viewers.  This movie is best seen in a theater, but its message will survive a trip to the small screen.

Most people see it do not understand it and say it sucks. Or they compare it to gorefest movies. Most people believe a movie shouldn't make you try to understand it. This movie does have a lot of gore, depending which version you get. Most people rent it and most rental places have the censored version. That version cuts out a great deal so when you try to understand it you can't because someone cut those parts out. This movie shows what could really happen. Most people who say it sucked for one did not understand it, didn't really watch it completely, or are people who compare it to what it is not. What I mean by that is someone compared it to Night of the Living Dead. That movie is in a whole other area of horror. Night of the Living Dead is about the dead returning to life by a virus carried in a meteor and eating people to keep the virus alive. TCM is about a crazed cannibalistic family with a chainsaw wielding maniac. People believed there was nothing to leather face. Well they are right. They believed this is not scary. Leather face had no sense of identity so he wore people's faces, he knew nothing else than killing. That is a lot more scary than anyother movie. A living person who shows no pity, only knows how to kill and cook food. What is worst of all there is one reason behind it he wants food. I can't believe people have the nerve to compare this to The newest TCM movie. That one leather face is a perverted transvestite. The original Leather face didn't take crap from anyone who was not his family. In the new one someone told leather face to sit down and shutup what did it (as I refer to that thing) do? It sat down. You got some woman who just sits there, and a guy with a robotic leg controlled by a tv remote, and a idiot with a tazer. Not one person was killed by a chainsaw.

There was no one is this movie named Carrie, therefore there was absolutely no connection between this Carrie and the first one.  This movie should have been independent from the first Carrie, and just be considered a movie, and not a sequel. The main character is instead a girl named Sue (Amy Irving). Though Irving was the best actor in the movie, she was not even comparable to Sissy Spacek, who played Carrie White.  I think that a bunch of rich film-makers sat around a table and talked about how much money movies like Scream and The Faculty were making, and therefore decided to make a few million easy dollars by destroying a classic. It's simple---  If you like movies that are low quality and are filled with appealing young actors who lack talent, then go see this Easy-money flick. If you like quality horror films, or don't believe in mutilating a classic for the sole purpose of film-makers to get rich---- stick to the orginal.
