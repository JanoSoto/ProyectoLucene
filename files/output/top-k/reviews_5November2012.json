A few years later, I watched this again and still loved it as ever. The premise really intrigued me. It was like Indiana Jones meets 20000 Leagues under the Sea and it works really well. There are two flaws that I really hate about this movie. First, there's the villain. James Garner voiced him really well, but Rourke is by far the worst Disney villain I have ever seen. He wants to find the Heart of Atlantis so he could use it to gain fame and fortune. Come on! It's the same villain Governor Ratcliffe from Pocahontas. The same thing happened to Clayton when he wants to find Gorillas in Tarzan and look how well that turned out. Second is the story. It has an original concept, but the story itself is too predictable for my tastes.Flaws aside, everything turned out great. Aside from the main villain, the main character Milo voiced by Michael J. Fox is likable as the brainiac nerd we've seen in most movies and his romance between him and Kida voiced by Cree Summer is romantic and enjoyable to watch. The side characters, although undeveloped, are good comic-relief pals that made me laugh right through the very end especially Mole who almost steals every scene. In fact, the voice acting for the characters is excellent. The action is pretty intense and enjoyable to watch especially the final battle which is my favorite part of the movie. The dialog is also smart and witty at the same time and the script is pretty clever. The music from James Newton Howard is beautiful and epic, but the strongest aspect goes to the animation. The visuals are lovely to look at it gives the movie an epic sweep to it and the character animation is nice to look at.Overall, Atlantis The Lost Empire may not be a masterpiece, but I don't understand the hate it had when it was first released because this is a completely underrated film that should be watched over & over again. Go watch it to those who have not seen it! It's that good!

Even though so many things are happening in parallel (or maybe *because* of it), the movie never, ever gets boring. Also, it is technically surprisingly adequate when it comes to aviation, except for a few glitches which are acceptable.Even though the special effect of the plane rising through the cloud layer is not very convincing, the rest of the movie is -- especially because the shots of the 707 on the runway at the end of the movie are real, which make for some breathtaking scenes.

I have no problem with a film dragging on, as long as the wait is worth it. There's another draggy film, Tarkovsky's Stalker, which I've watched thrice, and am planning on watching again in a few days. If anything, the length could be annoying (at most), but by no means a good reason to give this a 1 star. Another big thing that is said about this movie is its visual effects. I don't mind those either, no matter how good or bad they are, I only care about what is being portrayed. Other mild annoyances like occasional loud noises or 'eye twitching scenes' that to some people seemed like a crime against humanity I also completely ignored.So, now that I peeled off the most superfluous layers of nonsense, let's get to the core of things. Just what, exactly, is wrong about this film? Well everything, really. Everything except for HAL. Plot, dialog, acting, character development, direction, ending, underlying message, all of those contributed to my disappointment, so let's go in order. There is nothing inherently wrong about the plot, except that it felt like it was skimmed beyond recognition. There were plenty of parts that could have been filled with intricacies or explored in a deeper manner, such as the moon city (or whatever that was), the hibernating crew, the meeting scene, and some others I don't want to spoil. Instead, we were given merely the hint that there was something deeper and much more complex that wasn't being depicted because the director was too busy showing off his space ballet and spotless installations. The dialog was one of the most stale and uninteresting in cinema history, not a single memorable line was spoken here, and the soulless actors didn't help matters either. You'd think you'd get to see at least a subtle reaction from Dave in that one scene about the helmet, but you'd be wrong. The character development is also nonexistent; everyone's so shallow that you could switch their places around and it wouldn't make the smallest difference. Could you do that in a movie like Twelve Angry Men? BenHur? Pulp Fiction? Damn right you can't! The way the director tries to get to the audience is also laughable, in a sad way. Instead of recurring to actual talent and paying attention to all the important details, he relies almost entirely on his visual gimmicks and rotatory scenery. I wasn't transported into space with this film, it didn't make me wonder about its vastness and emptiness (not even with that one scene with frank), or -seeing it from our time- feel like I wished that's how things should have been at the turn of the millennium, the course of mankind, etc. All I saw was your typical World's Fair Futurama. Now the ending, I'm not going to spoil it, but I will tell you that if you were expecting something original and mind blowing, then you'd be as disappointed as me. If you know the musical piece that plays when the ape is swinging his bone, and you know the book which it is named after, and you've read that book, then some people may say that you'll see what the ending is all about. But quite frankly, that is by far the most blatant overstatement you're going to hear about this film. After watching it I learned that this is actually based off a book, and that made me realize that the ending I saw was just a shell, the carcass of an actual mind blowing ending that I'm looking forward to read some day. Though the one in this film, it really can't stand on its own (come to think of it, Stalker was also based off a book, and the ending was still supreme). The words that crossed through my head when I saw this movie end were literary these You have GOT to be kidding me because I just couldn't believe how pretentious some people could get, without having anything to actually boast about. Finally, for the underlying message, I'm just glad I'm not going to make this paragraph any longer, since there is none. The obvious message is right there for you to see, underneath it there is nothing (since apparently it's not worth exploring), and anyone who says otherwise I'll direct to the 'Black Square' review.As a final note I'd like to point out why this wasn't a 1 star. If I didn't make it clear earlier, it was HAL. All those 5 stars go to HAL, and it pains me that I couldn't give it 10. Everything bad I just said about this film does not, in any way, apply to HAL, not even the part where I called everyone soulless. The 9000 series is simply the most interesting concept of this movie -it's what made the WHOLE movie. Just think about it, without it, there would be absolutely nothing of worth to watch here. I've never seen a more iconic 'character' in my life, and now I know why HAL is so referenced and emulated throughout many mediums of our culture. The (quick) chess scene caused a great impact on me, being a retired chess player myself. I could just feel HAL's arrogance emanating from the screen at that moment, and he only had to say a few words but they got to me. The news reporter guy was merely echoing my thoughts when he commented on HAL's pride. So why couldn't the director drag on this scene instead of all the other nonsense? It could have been fantastic if done right.

Good thing Huston pulled it off.THE PLOT Doc Riedenschnieder has just been released from prison.

He turns to Emmerich, a rich family man, who runs little things on the side, like having an affair with a beautiful blonde.Unfortunately for Doc, Emmerich plans to double-cross him after the heist, and Doc knows it, but he goes on anyways. He recruits some other men, and at the same time Dix finds himself in a relationship with a woman whom he doesn't love, but who is devoted to him. SPOILERS. The heist doesn't come off the way Doc planned and he is faced with multiple double crosses and the cops on his trail. In other words, it's a typical Noir.THE CRITICISMJohn Huston was born for Noir. He defined the genre with The Maltese Falcon, and his sharp wit and attention to detail was a perfect match to that film's sharp and direct dialog. Here he works in the genre, but not in the tradition of films like The Big Sleep or Falcon, where there is some happiness. No, here no one is happy. They are greedy and selfish, and perhaps only Jean Hagen is the only non-cynical character, yet even she has an unhealthy selfish desire to nurture, to love Dix.There is no hope in The Asphalt Jungle, it is one of the most depressing things I've ever seen. It is also one of the most realistic films ever to come out of Hollywood. The gritty, hopeless city presented here could be any major city in the US. New York, Los Angeles, Miami, it could be set in any of those. These characters have been rotting from the inside out, and their insatiable greed and lust can only lead to their destruction.Yet you feel sorrow, you want them to have some kind of happy ending, and that is one thing that these people will never have. That brings me to the performances, uniformly excellent. Huston had a great knack for getting great performances out of actors, and this is no exception. Hayden has always been a unique actor.

Louis Calhern is slimy and, despite his good-guy act, he is rotting from the inside. His affair with Marilyn Monroe is just a way for him to embrace his true slimy nature. When he is questioned by the police, you can see him desperately trying to get himself out of the situation, lying until he can lie no more.Also good is Sam Jaffe as Doc and James Whitmore. The film barely has a score, which may be due to artistic intent or laziness, but the lack of score reinforces the gritty reality of the film. The cinematography is amazing, delving in the shadows and murky depths that define Noir.And finally the direction.

Nah, it's not something I rate highly.This bizarre sequel only crossed my radar when I saw it on sale rather cheap and I was surprised by how much I liked it. Taking place 13 years after the first movie it opens with a couple of Yuppies being massacred with a chainsaw (sadly, the only chainsaw massacres in the whole movie) and the case promptly investigated by renegade Texas Ranger 'Lefty' Enright (the brilliant Dennis Hopper). The sound of the killing is caught on tape by radio DJ-type lady 'Stretch', who Lefty uses as bait to lure Leatherface out of the shadows. The trail leads to the labyrinthine catacombs beneath an abandoned amusement park for an epic showdown that doesn't really happen.The problem begins with the second half in which Dennis Hopper seems to wander off into a different movie and nothing really becomes of his character while Stretch runs screaming from a horny Leatherface. It's a bit disappointing in this regard, but the wonderful set-design and gore effects keep it interesting. I just wish that there was more fodder for the titular chainsaw.A lot of people consider this to be a spoof, but I don't think so myself. Horror movie-making had changed a lot by this point in the 80s. With slashers and the tools of their trade gaining popularity the genre moved away from gritty, grindhouse darkness and into something more colorful and mainstream (for better or worse). TCM2 is just a reflection of that. It's trash, but it's highly energetic and manic trash that's never boring, despite its shortcomings.

It is also very, very entertaining, just pure comedy gold! I laughed out loud so many times while watching this. There is so much wrong with it! From the medieval lame version of Han Solo as the lead to the black buddy-cop friend and the sheer stupidity of the plot there are so many hilarious moments. But there is one performance that really stood out Jeremy Irons as the evil mage was one of the funniest, over the top performances I have seen! He is doing the whole OOOH look at me, I'm so evil! Seriously I'm evil, here watch me wave my arms and stare at the camera just to show how evil I am routine. He is like the medieval wizard equivalent of Dr Evil from Austin Powers. Sadly, there aren't enough scenes with him, instead we have to endure the stupid hero with his idiotic band of useless sidekicks. The film would have been so much better if it were more Jeremy Irons because he is just so incredibly camp and funny.

It is a heartwarming talke that will make you laugh and then all the sudden tear up.This movie is about a young quiet boy named Elliot. One day Elliot hears a noise in his shed so he decides to go have a look.What he finds is what he least expects...something not from this world. The boy is scared at first but then learns he means no harm.This is such a sweet movie great for little kids or familes or just any fans of goof movies.
