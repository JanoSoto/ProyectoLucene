Westerburg High School is a stereotypical high school filled with cliques, especially the most dominant one including three girls all named Heather (Shannen Doherty, Lisanne Falk, and Kim Walker). Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder) has begun to hang out with the three Heathers which she hates how they are right from the start of the film. She just wants to have her old life and old friends back. The movie is loaded with irony and dark comedy. And when I mean dark, I mean really dark. From crazy aspects like pulling guns out in school, murder in general, amongst other things. Veronica eventually meets J.D. (Christian Slater), a rebel who is an outsider and doesn't like the way the social cliques are and wants it to change. They begin dating and this eventually leads to a bit of murder here and there to the hierarchy of school social cliques. The entire thing rarely takes itself seriously, it's meant to be completely comical but the last 30 minutes are interesting. It gets more serious and to my surprise, it worked. It actually had some decent social commentary towards the end and had much more to say than just being a really hilarious dark comedy which was nice to see. Everyone in the cast performances the comedy with perfection, it seems to be have done with care. From the completely ironic lines, witty sarcasm, and the WTF moments in the movie, it has no boundaries with its performances and writings. This movie decided to do what it wanted and essentially had no rules at all. More movies like this need to exist because they don't care. They don't care what will offend people or not offend them, it does what it wants and it's done oh so tastefully. Overall, if you like your comedy as dark as possible, you'll love this movie, it will shock you with its humor but be hilarious as you question why you are laughing at the same time, and then it will surprise you again with a slightly more serious turn.

They must be considered lost for ever. However, this print was found in the Harvard Film Archives, and thus is acclaimed like that of a lost, and newly found, episode of 'Doctor Who'.Added material takes this version of the film to 94 minutes. It opens in a church, with star Edward Woodward, singing a hymn. However, this reviewer inwardly groaned, as the film quality looked poor, with the colour all washed out. However film quality picked up with the next scene, and quality remained good to OK at least, through the rest of the film, with very little exception. Some later scenes were shot in that very rich vivid colour that is just so emblematic of the seventies.After the short church scene, as we get the opening credits, we see Edward Woodward take off in a plane and fly to a Scottish island called Summerisle. On landing he is not made welcome but rather is told that the island is private property. Woodward declares that he is Sergeant Neil Howie of the West Highland Police Force and that he is here to investigate the case of a missing child.Sgt Howie stays the night in the local inn. He is not impressed with the hospitality, nor the rowdy locals. He realizes the culture of the island is very different from his own. His culture shock deepens as he visits the local school, and finally, when he meets Lord Summerisle, JP, owner of the island, and somewhat of a feudal lord, he finally has revealed to him, the full history of the island.The audience, in these encounters, enjoys the obvious comedy, as the good Christian policeman, becomes increasingly shocked by his encounters, until finally engaging in verbal cut and thrust with a rather louche Lord Summerisle, played by Christopher Lee.Sgt Howie, despite all the obstacles he encounters, is determined to pursue his investigation of the missing child.There is much music in the film. All very appropriate. Mostly a lot of folk music, lots of singing, but also a little piping too. In a recent interview, a musician described how he was required to beat the drum to help Brit Ekland, with the rhythm, in her famous musical number. He went on to say that filming took all day, with the naked Miss Ekland, wrapped in a towel between takes. The musician stated that Miss Ekland demanded, and got, a bottom-double, whilst he himself spend the day with Miss Ekland, handing the said towel to her, and taking it from her, between takes. I have had worse jobs he drolly commented.Principle stars of the film are ably supported by Diane Cilento, Gerry Cowper and Ingrid Pitt. However my own personal favourite is the Gardener\/Gravedigger, played lustily, to the hilt, by Aubrey Morris.A young couple sat next to me as the film started, but left after about half-an-hour. For young lovers, with low-boredom thresholds, it should be stated that this is not an all-action or slasher-type of horror. Rather it is slow-burning character-driven suspense film. If this appeals to you, if you wish to find out if Herodotus is right that custom is king, if you are looking for a raunchy sexy horror with lots and lots of lusty singing, then this classic cult horror is the film for you. 9\/10.

","genre":"Horror, Mystery"},{"date":"10 October 2013","score":"","review":" The Hunt for Red October is a very interesting movie. Based on Tom Clancy's novel of the same name. It was directed by John McTiernan and about a Soviet submarine captain Marko Ramius (Sean Connery) that command Red October (октябрь) a new vessel that features a device call the caterpillar drive. The caterpillar drive rendering it undetectable to sonar. Ramius leaves port on orders to conduct exercises with the captain of submarine V.K. Konovalov, former student Captain Tupolev (Stellan Skarsgård). Instead of doing that, Ramius commands the crew to head toward America's east coast to conduct missile drills. The United States government officials think the Red October pose a threat, and sent the captain of the USS Dallas, Commander Bart Mancuso (Scott Glenn), to meet the enemy. CIA analyst Jack Ryan (Alex Baldwin) thinks other side, thinking that Ramius instead plans to defect with the new weapon. It becomes a race of time to stop all-out war as the clock ticks down in this Cold War drama. The movie unlike all other Tom Clancy's novels turn movies is pretty tame, as action goes along. It's more made out to be a smart strategy action movie than a mindless shoot it up film. The action is limited due to it being a submarine movie, but the film use slow tense motions like what Ramius is going to do, and what the other submariners are thinking of his action to build up suspense. Nobody knows for sure, what is going to happen. The torpedoes scenes were pretty mind blowing. The film is a bit dated, and some of the talking can be a bit boring, but the dialogue works for the film. Still, I can see every actor playing their parts even if the Russian accents is a bit mediocre. It's weird to see a Scotsman (Connery), Australian (Sam Neill), and English (Tim Curry) playing Soviets. It is better that they didn't use the Russian accent when speaking English too much. Couldn't they find any good Eastern actors for these roles, still! They did their part, but it's hard to think of these actors as Russians. The way, the actors go out of Russian to English, to Russian to English is a bit confusing. The film starts out in Russian, then switches to English in an early scene as the political officer reads the passage from the Bible. The switch occurs on the word Armageddon, which is the same in both languages. I like the symbolism of that. Sean Connery and Scott Glenn are both commanding in their roles, as both had some submarining training before this film. I wouldn't change that. In my opinion, I would rather have the Harrison Ford's Jack Ryan than Alec Baldwin's. His Jack Ryan seems too wimpy for me and found him weak. Jack Ryan would go on to be the central characters of many of Clancy's later novels. One thing about the movie that I like is, how the screenwriters (Larry Ferguson & Donald Stewart) did an excellent job making a complex plot simple to follow. Tom Clancy is a great author, but one thing about his novels is how compound it can be. Being the first novel by Clancy adapted to the screen, it also serves as the best Tom Clancy's adaptation. The different between the book and the movie are somewhat wide. The biggest different is that in the book there was also a separate story involving a US spy in the Kremlin which doesn't occur in the film. The film also act more action to the film like the October has to avoid a torpedo and Ryan getting on aboard the USS Dallas that wasn't in the book. Those things work somewhat to me. It made the film interesting during the slow parts. The movie did lost it tensed Cold War feel, when the movie came out. By February 1990, just before the film's theatrical release, the Soviet government announced that the Communist Party was no longer completely in charge, effectively ending the Cold War. To compensate for the change in Russia's political climate, an on-screen crawl appears at the beginning of the film stating that it takes place in 1984 during the Cold War than 1990. The music written by Basil Poledouris was great has a Cold War theme, and bear similarity to Russian Army band songs. So it was a bit epic and scary at the same time. The movie could have better if only if the film had a larger budget. The underwater scenes model of the submarine look too much like models for me. I know they could had done better, because 4 years later, Crimson Tide (1994) came out with better effects. They could had use better use of the technology at the time to make the submarines look real than spending 20,000 dollars on Sean Connery's hairpiece. The movie did get some heat, as it did reveal some classified submarine technology at the time with the use of gravimetry as a method of silent navigation in US submarines. There are a lot of factual errors, and anachronisms to nitpick, but it doesn't bother me from the film too much. Overall the film was pretty good. Still, the main crime committed against this film was the horrendous film-to-DVD transfer it got. Frankly, this film suffer from sheer graininess that hasn't been solve in its newest released. if you like submarine movies you will like this, as this movie has some depth to it.

Nobody knows for sure, what is going to happen. The torpedoes scenes were pretty mind blowing. The film is a bit dated, and some of the talking can be a bit boring, but the dialogue works for the film. Still, I can see every actor playing their parts even if the Russian accents is a bit mediocre. It's weird to see a Scotsman (Connery), Australian (Sam Neill), and English (Tim Curry) playing Soviets. It is better that they didn't use the Russian accent when speaking English too much. Couldn't they find any good Eastern actors for these roles, still! They did their part, but it's hard to think of these actors as Russians. The way, the actors go out of Russian to English, to Russian to English is a bit confusing. The film starts out in Russian, then switches to English in an early scene as the political officer reads the passage from the Bible. The switch occurs on the word Armageddon, which is the same in both languages. I like the symbolism of that. Sean Connery and Scott Glenn are both commanding in their roles, as both had some submarining training before this film. I wouldn't change that. In my opinion, I would rather have the Harrison Ford's Jack Ryan than Alec Baldwin's. His Jack Ryan seems too wimpy for me and found him weak. Jack Ryan would go on to be the central characters of many of Clancy's later novels. One thing about the movie that I like is, how the screenwriters (Larry Ferguson & Donald Stewart) did an excellent job making a complex plot simple to follow. Tom Clancy is a great author, but one thing about his novels is how compound it can be. Being the first novel by Clancy adapted to the screen, it also serves as the best Tom Clancy's adaptation. The different between the book and the movie are somewhat wide. The biggest different is that in the book there was also a separate story involving a US spy in the Kremlin which doesn't occur in the film. The film also act more action to the film like the October has to avoid a torpedo and Ryan getting on aboard the USS Dallas that wasn't in the book. Those things work somewhat to me. It made the film interesting during the slow parts. The movie did lost it tensed Cold War feel, when the movie came out. By February 1990, just before the film's theatrical release, the Soviet government announced that the Communist Party was no longer completely in charge, effectively ending the Cold War. To compensate for the change in Russia's political climate, an on-screen crawl appears at the beginning of the film stating that it takes place in 1984 during the Cold War than 1990. The music written by Basil Poledouris was great has a Cold War theme, and bear similarity to Russian Army band songs. So it was a bit epic and scary at the same time. The movie could have better if only if the film had a larger budget. The underwater scenes model of the submarine look too much like models for me. I know they could had done better, because 4 years later, Crimson Tide (1994) came out with better effects. They could had use better use of the technology at the time to make the submarines look real than spending 20,000 dollars on Sean Connery's hairpiece. The movie did get some heat, as it did reveal some classified submarine technology at the time with the use of gravimetry as a method of silent navigation in US submarines. There are a lot of factual errors, and anachronisms to nitpick, but it doesn't bother me from the film too much. Overall the film was pretty good. Still, the main crime committed against this film was the horrendous film-to-DVD transfer it got. Frankly, this film suffer from sheer graininess that hasn't been solve in its newest released. if you like submarine movies you will like this, as this movie has some depth to it.

Soon, the teasing ensues and campers start winding up dead. Gee, I wonder who it could be? The Good Honestly, it's kind of hard to find a lot of good qualities in this movie. It's not scary. It's not very disturbing. It's not funny. Oh wait, this is supposed to be my list of good qualities! Okay, so how about.... ummm.... yeah, I got nothing. It's not that the film is horrible, it just doesn't do anything new or different. It's just kind of there. I guess some of the make-up effects on the dearly departed weren't too bad. The dead kid in the boat was even a little disturbing, but the problem is that all the killing is done with shadow effect (killing occurs off-screen), so it kind of ruins the gore and after all... this is supposed to be a slasher film. That was a pretty poor list of good things.The Bad This will be easier. So we are at a youth camp of some sort where it looks like the kids are around 10-18 in age range. Pretty hard to tell what the camp is for, because they are always just hanging out and swimming... or playing baseball. Why they have the long, drawn out baseball scenes in this, I'll never know. Maybe to show the good guys from the bad? Either way... kids start dying. And not just dying, but being murdered in diabolical ways. Where are the angry parents? Where are all the police? And the camp is not only remaining open, murder after murder, but all the kids are still goofing around like nothing has happened? They even host a movie night after about the third kid is murdered. The only cop that shows up is a tad suspicious, but doesn't really do much. Musta been that super realistic mustache. The kids are all very unlikeable, foul-mouthed punks in redonkulous short shorts and various other 80's garb (especially the camp counselor that looks like Journey's Steve Perry on steroids). Angela, who is supposed to be the focus of this film, just stares... at everyone. Says nothing. It's like, just do something!.. say something! Finally, after half the movie, she opens up her mouth and then her stilted dialogue becomes worse than the silence. Then you're like, just stop talking! All the kids are just whiny and fighting and it doesn't make much sense for the most part. Angela gets picked on and retaliates... that's about it. And there's other creepy, odd stuff like the pedophile cook and the teen camper asking out the 70 year old owner? Like, what is up with that? And he's excited about it? Get me outta here. I gave it 4 stars simply because it was good enough to view in it's entirety and it somehow made you care to see how it would end. There was enough there to want to find out.The Twist Okay, so since I put the spoiler tag on my review, I am going to spill the beans on the twist. So if you haven't seen it, maybe it's a good time to stop reading. The twist is that Angela is a boy. They reveal this by showing her freaked-out, standing over a freshly killed dude and stark naked. Then the movie ends. Uh, okay. They honestly spent about 5 minutes total on Angela's back-story, which from what I can gather is that her cousin's parents took her in after hers died(?) and they really wanted a girl, not a boy. So apparently, they made her live like a girl or something. Traumatic... sure. Enough to make you a total weirdo and start slaughtering other campers? Hm. I didn't buy it. Maybe if they had spent more time showing what had happened to her, err.. him, we could have seen her\/him endure the torture that made her\/him go crazy. Instead, she\/he just comes off as an oddball the whole movie and killing for what just appears to be mild to moderate hazing and then BOOM, we are just told that all this torturous mind-screwing is really the reason why. Like I said, I didn't buy it and it's probably why I didn't let a lot of the other weaker plot points go, because the main twist didn't work for me... so the movie fell apart.

Amongst the filth and depravity of the night-time New York streets, Travis comes across a twelve-year old prostitute called Iris (Jodie Foster). Feeling like it is his duty to protect his preadolescent, Travis begins to succumb to a previously-suppressed urge for violence within him.'Taxi Driver' easily ranks amongst the greatest films ever made, and is arguably also Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro's best film (though there are other valid contenders too). What makes the film so good is that it's the perfect snapshot of the time &#x96; late seventies, an America that is still reeling from the horrors of Vietnam, with that disillusionment and depravity so beautifully portrayed. But, despite the film being so rooted in time, it manages to remain relevant today almost 40 years later. This could be watched in 2013, and still resonate with the viewer as much as it would have done in the seventies.Obviously, the main draw of the movie is Mr DeNiro. And, yes, he is incredible. From the very first shot, he is sublime. The film has often been described as a horror movie and, if you go with that line of thinking, then DeNiro is easily the monster. His cheeky grins and boyish looks are hiding a sinister side &#x96; as the film goes on, and the façade slips, Bickle becomes frightening. It's amazing to see DeNiro make that transformation.In the deserved praise heaped on DeNiro, I think the power of Jodie Foster's performance is somewhat underrated. At only twelve years, having to play the role she does, Foster is amazing. Not many kids that age would play a prostitute, but she does it, and does it brilliantly. I've never been a massive fan of Foster's work, but she certainly does a stellar job in this movie.Another great aspect of the movie is the score. Again, the horror movie theory is backed up by the downright frightening theme music. More than an actual tune, it is almost a warning drone. Rising brass instruments, loud and brash, it is haunting and creates the perfect ambiance for the film.I could go on and on about all the other good things about the movie (Cybill Shepherd, Scorsese's cameo, the aesthetic violence, the visceral nature of the film, the script), but I'd be here forever. If you haven't seen it already, shame on you. See it now. It's an education in cinema.

Though the story line was rather linear and predictable, the events that transpired along the way, coupled with a lovable set of characters and some great tunes, kept things lively. However, if I was rating this movie for its characters and music alone, I'd have given it more then 7\/10.

The animation was a bit sketchy throughout the movie, especially when it came to moments of action and close ups. I am aware, however, that this was originally created in the 70s, a time when the traditional, hand- drawn methods were prevalent.

But now, onto the good stuff!Maybe it was because of their diverse accents, but I must admit, each and every character, whether they be primary, secondary, or just tagging along for the ride, were portrayed amazingly.

However, I suspect that many of you, at least those of you who are as old as I am (and I am not going to actually tell you how old I am) will already know this. Another, thing that I just thought of, this movie is pretty much an 80's version of Ted, except that Ted is a soppy feel good movie, where as this movie has The Dark Overlords of the Universe.

But&#x85;then it turned dark, disturbing, actually gruesome and I'm shocked it only got slapped with a PG-Rating. Granted, in 1984, the PG-13 was just coming about, and though Rated-R would've been harsh and a box-office kill, PG was really generous.A little Mogwai creature is brought home by a comically horrible inventor father and given to his way-older-looking-than-he-was son (the actor was 20, but looked 30,) but with three simple rules it cannot touch water, it doesn't like bright lights or the deathly sunlight and don't feed it after midnight. Naturally, the (supposedly) teen son breaks all of these rules and after the water multiples the Mogwai, or the better and cuter name for him Gizmo and they're all fed after midnight, with the exception of Gizmo, they metamorphose into what my mother referred to as little Satan demons, and attack the town. It's up to man-boy, his equally older-looking teen girlfriend and Gizmo to stop the madness.Oh, those rules. While simple and a fun addition to this well-written script, the restrictions\/instructions made no sense, with the exception of the bright light. Water is everywhere and in almost every &#x96; if not every, food and liquid. So what would you ever feed it? If they elaborated, like Don't get water on or in it, but you can feed him dehydrated foods&#x85; And about this midnight rule&#x85;Which midnight? (They actually bring this flaw up in the sequel, but for this movie's sake...) Is this a curse and is only good for the time zone the Mogwai's in? And it's never, ever, brought up UNTIL WHEN. Again, elaborate Don't feed it after midnight, to say, six in the morning.I might be looking in too deep in a movie that was supposed to be half light\/half horror, all entertainment, but I seriously couldn't get past those open-ended and vague rules.Okay, fine, I could get past them &#x96; eventually, and I did have a good time in this totally 80s movie. Overall, it's not a bad flick, and the invention of both Gizmo and the eventual Satan's little evil fiends, was worth the watch. Especially, cute little Gizmo.

Overbearing bumbling oaf and his mousy, tolerant wife. When it started I didn't think I would like it as it was so unlike a Hitchcock film. But this picture grows on you and becomes more interesting as the story develops.As other reviewers have mentioned, a shlub couple, he a dreary accountant and she a dreary housewife, come into some money and decide to spend it on the high life topped off by a world cruise. They each fall in love with a third party before realizing they were meant for each other. At least as a default position.Rich And Strange is part romance and part comedy, and both elements are understated in the English manner. Some of the comedy parts are quite humorous and some of the romantic moments are quite touching, and the acting is solid. Henry Kendall plays the oafish husband with traces of a stage background, and Joan Barry is as sensitive and appealing as she is lovely. Percy Marmont is a stalwart Englishman with principles - but will overlook them for Ms. Barry.When it started I thought maybe a five rating, but by the end I gave it a seven. As I mentioned, it gets better, and there are some unmistakable traces of The Master. It is a valuable inclusion in the Hitchcock canon, if for no other reason than being a step stone towards Hitchcock's evolution as one of filmdom's best directors.
