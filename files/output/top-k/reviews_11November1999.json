Were 20-somethings in the 1930's or the 1950's just as upset and had the same at-the-end-of-their-rope kind of attitude towards life and all that makes it go round?  I can't answer those questions because I am both too young to know and I also don't know enough about sociological histories of us as people to make an educated guess.  But I can guesstimate rather intelligently that there is a good chance that people weren't quite as cynical as my generation is because there wasn't as much to be bitter and cynical about.  I am not saying that people from past generations didn't have stresses and pressures but they certainly didn't have the same things to worry about that we do heading into the new millenium.  Credit card abuse and subsequent debt is out of control, banks are bigger and more powerful than they ever have been, the job market is paradoxically increasing and decreasing at a rapid rate, capitalism is still a great thought and concept for those that capitalize on it but it is cumbersome and burdensome for most others, computers are again paradoxically a blessing and then again they may be the anti-Christ.  The point is that there are so many new things to worry about now than there were when my parents were growing up.  And a movie like Fight Club in some subliminal and metaphoric ways address these issues quietly and then in other ways it is not quiet metaphors that grace the screen but loud in-your-face opinions and facts that bombard you and forces you to ask yourself some tough questions.  Movies like Fight Club don't come around too often and that is because not every movie or the people behind it have the intelligence and the audacity to ask such tough questions nor do they the smarts to make an entertaining movie to please the masses that may not want to see a deep film and nothing more.  Fight Club is one of the best films to come so far this year and even if it is perhaps 15 minutes too long, I would rather see a film that has too much to say than a film that has nothing to say at all.  Fight Club has a lot to say.Edward Norton and Brad Pitt play two completely opposite characters that are some how attracted to each other, not in the sexual sense of course, but perhaps because they are such opposites, one lives vicariously through the other.  For those of you that have see this movie, you will know how true that statement really is, for those of you that haven't seen it, you have to view it for yourself to really comprehend how true that statement really is.  Norton is a bit of a repressed, yet seemingly average society guy that just exists.  His world and his life don't really go any further than his office and his apartment and his only form of social engagement is through the television and through self help groups that he begins to attend.  He doesn't suffer through any of the symptoms that the groups suffer with but this is his way of expressing himself, his only way of letting go.  Pitt plays Tyler Durden, a recluse who prides himself on living hard and living fast and having fun with what he has and laughing at what he doesn't.  He is also incredibly charming, ridiculously smart and clever and he is in the best shape that I have seen a guy in that has been in the movies, think of Stallone in Rocky IV but slim him up some and you have Tyler Durden.  He also has sex for what seems to be hours at a time and always pleasures the lady that he is with.  Norton seems in awe of him and they form some sort of friendship, and that is how Fight Club starts.  One night after a few beers they begin to fight after Durden tells Norton to hit him.  So he does and they begin this nightly ritual and soon other people come to their underground hush-hush fisticuff display and they too are there to get their anger and frustrations out.  The rules of Fight Club are very strict, and I'm sure by now we have all heard that the first and second rule of Fight Club is to not talk about it.  I, as a reviewer, and film lover, like that rule so I will not tell you anymore what the film is really about or what it encompasses and what direction that it goes in.  Just know that if you pay attention to what the film is saying, you will get a lot more out of it than a bunch of guys pounding each other to a pulp.  This film is very entertaining but moreso it is intelligence personified.  It has opinions about our life, our lifestyle, our obsessions, our vices and almost everything that defines the times that we live in.  I don't think I have really seen a film like this before and I applaud it for having the guts and the intelligence to challenge it's viewers to think.  Sure, there are a lot of bloody and gory scenes in here but they are not really any more shocking than some of the other films that are out there these days.  Too much has been made of that small part of the film when what should be told is how this film will make you feel as you leave the theater and how it will stay with you in the days and weeks to come.  American Beauty did that to me and even though these are two different films, they have similar things to say but they just took different roads to get to a similar point.  And both are two of my favourite films to come out this year.  I hope this film does get some recognition at Oscar time, it is that good.  Oh yeah, and it has a really neat secret, you thought Sixth Sense was clever in that way, wait until you see this one.  It's even better, I think anyway.In a year that has given us a lot of great films ( Blair Witch, Arlington Road, Instinct, Sixth Sense, American Beauty, Three Kings, American Pie and The Matrix just to name a few ) this is one of the best and it will probably make a lot of critics top ten lists.  It has made mine so far and if the race for Oscar goes as it usually does then this film will get lost in the shuffle as most films that want to be remembered at Oscar time get released later in the year.  But no matter, this is still one of the best this year and if you have avoided this film because of what you have heard about the violence, then my advice is simple.  Ignore all that and go see it for what it has to say.  You will walk out of the theater with a new look on what you see around you.  But then again, do you want to do that or do you enjoy living in the bubble of naivete that this film claims we do?  Think about it.

He conveys much more emotion and presence with his eyes alone than many actors do with all the dialogue in the world.

I dreamt about it.  From the moment it started, I was HOOKED.  The opening scenes as the credits rolled were of Geraldine's character, Clara Marrable planting a tree in her desert garden.  It's quite obvious that she's meticulous when it comes to the care of her garden...  This movie was very intriguing as a result of Clara's sharp wit,and even sharper tongue.  (To tell you the truth, the only reason I stuck with the movie was because this woman had such a bada*s attitude!  She probably should have been a Marine or somethin'...)  I estimated that this movie was filmed during the mid-sixties, based on the clothing which was worn.  Even then, for a woman (especially one of her stature) to be as assertive during that time was rather unusual to me.  Clara's character was very masculine, with all the delicate, matronly, little touches that make her every bit the upstanding societal pillar of a lady she pretended to be. Don't get me wrong, this movie was a little bit weird.  As it starts, it's hard to understand where it's all going, and how long you're going to have to sit there and wait for something to happen...  Luckily, something's always on the brink of happening, so you shan't get too bored.  And really, if you want to learn how to be a shrewd individual, you'd better sit down and watch this movie, and be sure to take a few pertinent notes  Geraldine has the act DOWN. Her portrayal of this cold-hearted Mrs. Marrable is really what makes this movie the sleeper that it is.  I mean, everyone pretty much assumes *Technicolor* productions from the sixties are gonna have fabulous psychedelic qualities to them like, Man, is that tree really GREEN or what?  Lest we forget the half-baked acting (A'la Valley of the Dolls)...  To a degree, this movie is no different.  Clara's demonic attitude, social grace, and charm keep you on your toes as you really don't know what she's going to do next.  Don't be fooled by the packaging, or the era from which it came.  This is a pretty decent flick if you like suspense-thrillers...

I spent my summer buying into the movies (I do not classify them as films) which created these illusions of genuine pleasure, entertainment which does not necessarily attempt to indulge into the true emotions which one can conceivably experience at the cinema. I saw The Phantom Menace, Austin Powers, Big Daddy, The Blair Witch Project, and others I cannot even remember. Yes, I contributed to their $100,000,000.00+ grosses, and for the most, came out satisfied to the extent at which I expected.It might seem rather unorthodox, or even hypocritical, that I am beginning a review of a box-office blockbuster by seemingly distinguishing it from the other summer blockbusters, yet there is a method to my madness. I, in fact, did not pay $8 to see Notting Hill in the theatre; I had no desire to. In mid-November I discovered that it was now available for rent and I had 2 hours to kill and $4 to burn.At present, as I type my perception of the film, I am watching it for the second consecutive time. At this moment, Anna Scott (Julia's character) has just leaned in to give William their first kiss. When I saw this for the first time two hours ago, I was taken by her action.

Yet, in Notting Hill, Julia had the ability to captivate me with her smile; it complimented every feature of her face and displayed a charm which I do not usually affiliate with the silent expression of a perfect smile. Her entire performance as the misunderstood Hollywood dreamgirl, which one would believe to be quite nature for her, was strikely original and unexpected moving.

It is not her character that is original the Hollywood actor wanting to return to a mundane and simplistic lifestyle has, of course, been done before. Although, it was not her identification with the character which appealled to me, it was her ability to express the competing lifestyles within a single individual trapped in the limelight image vs desire, body vs heart, false aura vs true love. Her dialogue did not seem to come from a script. This is also a sign of great writing, creating the natural instead of the contrived. Yet, it was the method by which Julia allowed herself to live through her character, using that experience as a famous Hollywood actress to deliver a truly wonderful, sweet and loving performance.Notting Hill is a romantic comedy but it is not structured around conventions. Its comedy is not designed to created side-splitting humour, its story does not circulate entirely around an unattainable love, although one may perceive that. It is a character-driven film, but not to any exaggerated extent. They are not put into situations which seems completely unlikely and ultimately results in a larger than life scenario which thrives on the audience's desire to experience the escapist's side of a situation, one that they would never be able to contend with. Notting Hill is structured by simple situations, believeable circumstances that would conflict a relationship between a Hollywood megastar and an everyday Romeo. As the events culiminate, my emotions grew and I was in tears by the time the film ended, with my complete emotional expression coming as the last frame faded to black.I loved the premise of the film; the music was choice and perfectly paced and timed; the direction was subtle and very comprehensive.

The context of the film may not create ideal circumstance for me, I may not want to necessarily surrender my heart to a misunderstood Hollywood actress seeking a love which cannot exist within her current lifestyle, but great films work to stretch beyond their structured boundaries, and express desires that are in fact transferable and can exist, to a certain, simplistic extent, outside of the presented narrative. Films, although for the most part are fictional stories, work as both mirrors and windows to our own reality, exaggerating certain themes to provide a greater and clearer examination of the world around us. It is a highly critical art form, and can be a truly wonderful, moving, and enlightening experience. Notting Hill does not attempt to distort reality for the purpose of increasing its entertainment value, but rather presents a story which examines an evolutionary process of love, and the circumstances which may accompany such an endeavor. The characters may be creations of a screenwriter, but the basic experiences and emotions of those two characters are not restricted to them.

I am not a Jane Austen purist - if I were, I could not say that the Root\/Hinds version of Persuasion was my favorite Austen adaptation, which it is.  This is Patricia Rozema's Mansfield Park, NOT Jane Austen's.First, Rozema gives us a feisty, spirited Fanny Price, who tells off Aunt Norris and Sir Thomas, who accepts Henry Crawford's proposal, and then rejects it the next day (a la JA herself with Harris Bigg-Wither). In this MP, Sir Thomas deserves to be told off. He is portrayed as a lecherous dirty old man, who leers at Fanny and Mary Crawford throughout the film.We have all heard about the additions Rozema made to the film. She deals with the slavery issue in a very heavy-handed way, beating us over the head with it whenever possible. Tom Bertram is not the empty-headed fop he is in JA's book; here he is just as much an abolitionist as Fanny, and it is his sketchbook filled with incriminating drawings of Sir Thomas abusing the slaves in Antigua that Fanny finds. In fact, Rozema's take on Tom is rather bizarre; in the book, his arguments with his father center around his irresponsibility and his profligacy. In the film, while Sir Thomas tries to scold his son for these faults, Tom takes him to task for his activities in Antigua. What I found odd was that, if Tom is such an abolitionist, why would he be so free and easy with money tainted by the slave trade?Rozema left out what I consider to be some very important people and scenes. William Price and the Grants are nowhere to be seen; as a result, there is no amber cross bought with prize money, no distress over which chain to wear to the ball, no one to accompany Fanny to Portsmouth. Fanny's dislike and distrust of Henry are never fully explained. We never get to see the outing to Sotherton and, while we do see Maria flirting relentlessly with Henry, we never see him playing one sister off against the other. Fanny's disapproval of the theatricals is never explained either. In Rozema's version, it seemed as if Fanny was simply not invited to be in the play, instead of being unalterably opposed to it. The scene with Fanny playing Anhalt to help Mary Crawford rehearse is also completely wrong. Mary starts caressing Fanny, while Edmund watches with his eyes almost popping out of his head. So, instead of Edmund giving in and joining the play in order to spare his family the embarrassment of publicity, we are left with the impression that he takes on the role of Anhalt just so that he can justify having Mary run her hands all over him.Next, we have the scenes at Portsmouth. Here, we have Henry sending Fanny a display of fireworks and doves, and then we see her accepting his proposal and sealing the bargain with some less-than-chaste kisses - in public, no less! The  (in)famous sex scene between Maria and Henry takes place at Mansfield Park rather than in London and, because Rozema has played with JA's chronology of events, Fanny is already back from Portsmouth, and it is she who catches them in the act. Edmund is present for the aftermath, where Maria tries to defend her actions.Another thing that galled me no end is that Mary Crawford's defense of her brother's actions is done in person, at Mansfield Park. She is patronizing towards all concerned, including Sir Thomas, who has finally stopped leering by this point. The newspaper item announcing Maria and Henry's behavior to the world is read by Fanny, and the culprits' full names are used, which is also not the way it happened in the book.A couple of people walked out about 1\/3 of the way through the screening I attended, and several others walked out just as the credits began.

In moments of romantic ardour, he is wont roguishly to twirl it into perky love-handlebars. Stalinesque in scale and sweep, the whiskers betoken both the Colonel's (oh-so-misplaced) political loyalties and his rootsy Russianness - in contrast to Mitya, the mercurial snake in the grass, rival for the affections of Kotov's young wife and his smooth-faced Nemesis.A glorious summer's day dawns somewhere deep in the bosom of the Motherland. Kotov's dacha, remnant of a pre-Soviet age, is filled with light, billowing curtains and good-natured Chekhovian comings and goings.

It seemed like a minor plot device thrown in at the last minute, but the entire movie centred around it and Spacey's increasing disenchantment with his life.I laughed a few times, but those times were few and far between.  At least I made it through the entire movie, though.  A friend walked out of the theatre half-way through, completely bored and preferring to go for a walk instead.I found myself begging (silently) for at least a nude scene or two once I realized the movie wasn't going to be to my liking, but even those seemed contrived and added as afterthoughts to the screenplay.  Oh, look, breasts. Whee.Utterly forgettable movie in my books, although I definitely appear to be in the minority on this one.  4\/10 (and a very kind 4 at that).

But, scary? No f***ing way!!!!!! The camerawork, the characters and the story were pretty realistic but not all of the time. The film was to short and didn't have, as far as I know, any real scary moments. The ending of the film was one of the worst and most sudden I've ever seen. I think it's unbelievable that this film has made so much money, all the hype made this movie seem one of the best ever made, but in essence it is a pretty big flop. It's amazing that I still give it a 6 out of a 10, but that's only because the style of the film is very original when compared with other movies and it has it's realistic moments. My vote of 6 for this movie can easily be a lot lower.

The animation is top of the line, up to par with adult anime. The movie itself is great, with cool production design (Especially Mewtwo's Psi-Suit, which he uses to harness his powers) and a good plot.  But the worst part is the last 10 minutes, where everything goes full-of-heart-and-warm.  The characters don't suggest Geez, we shouldn't fight. It goes no where. Instead, they SAY it, in just those words. UG. And then Mewtwo, instead of taking his chance to kill Mew, just sees his wrongs and turns good. Yuck. All in all, this movie would be about a 9, but the end and the little short knock it down to a 7.
