Galaxy Quest then, which is more or less a direct parody of the popular cult-phenomenon is an enjoyable romp in that it shows a direct love for the material that it draws its satire and parody from, but nevertheless keeps the throttle on drawing out the laughs. The result is a mildly entertaining piece of throw-away cinema that fans of science-fiction should get a laugh or two out of, but nevertheless fails to stand as a work of its own.Functioning as something of an oddity in the realm of the parody, Galaxy Quest, despite its large focus on farcical slapstick laughs and zaney characters nevertheless too often stoops to extremely broad and caricature forms of humour at the expense of all else. While this sporadically works from time to time, the majority of the comical side present here is tepid at best&#x97;the film certainly strives to draw out the laughs every thirty seconds, but more often than not, it fails. With that being said, it should be noted that this does not necessarily dampen the film's ability to entertain and amuse. A lack of belly laughs makes the adventure a little less memorable than one would hope, but the ride itself remains an enjoyable and light-heartedly engaging one.Perhaps the greatest element of Dean Parsiot's feature therefore lies in its performers who&#x97;although playing characters stemming largely from broad cardboard cutouts of your typical TV sci-fi star&#x97;manage to overcome their overtly flat natures to add a little personality, charm and depth to their roles. Despite there being quite a few more annoyances in this department than would be adequate, Galaxy Quest combines its overall parody of sci-fi TV with characters who feel human in spite of their fluctuating sense of reality relating to those who worship them. It's at the movie's opening sequences that all elements of the proceeding ninety minutes are set up&#x97;the stars are desperate and clinging onto their only real jobs of signing autographs and pandering to people uninterested in them as actors or people, but moreso with the characters they portrayed decades prior.This layering, although underplayed in order to avoid putting too much emotional heft onto the otherwise breezy comedy, works well and sometimes even eclipses the more light-hearted moments of the film. Yet much of the movie takes place&#x97;believe it or not&#x97;on a real spaceship in space where the crew must help a dying race overcome a tyrannical lizard guy intent on wiping them all from existence. How pampered actors and has been extras get to this point has something to do with this (very annoying) race receiving transmissions of their old sci-fi TV show Galaxy Quest (mistaking it as historical documents from Earth), but you're never supposed to be taking such things seriously.

This is before Michael Madsen's Rudy Travis shows up, an injured and pretty ticked off gangster-come-thief, that hijacks both the couple and the couple's car as they head out in search of the money.

Rather than begin like the original with its male lead already in prison, it initially sees its lead characters of Carter 'Doc' McCoy (Baldwin) and Carol McCoy (Basinger) partake in an apprehension of a Mexican criminal, which is badly constructed and executed with too much ease on the characters' behalf. Following this, is the imprisonment of Doc when Rudy seemingly does the only thing possible at the time and leaves him behind for the authorities. It plants a somewhat meek seed in our minds that Rudy is of this nature.When in prison, Doc learns the 'importance of life' and that 'life is very delicate and something to be treasured' through cradling a mouse for part of his duration, in what is another scene in which the film calls on small, defenceless animals to act as a visual representation of either emotions and\/or the realisation of a situation. He is called upon to do the race course job with another guy and his old chum, Rudy. Through the mouse, he decides this will be his last. The fact the leads are in debt to the mentioned Jack Benyon keeps a fair degree of suspense for a while as this figure more powerful than the leads calls the shots.

This was Disney's effort, which is pretty enjoyable and surprisingly adult in theme, although it has several shortcomings. Its best feature is its amazing Cygnus sets\/effects by veteran designer Peter Ellenshaw, who also worked on Disney's 1954 classic adaptation of 20000 Leagues Under The Sea, which in many ways this is an outer space retelling of, with Reinhardt as Captain Nemo. The Cygnus is just colossal, with a vast central corridor, a spherical bridge, a hydroponics plant, transport tunnels - it's just immense. These are also a liability however; towards the finale the ship gets wrecked and the film becomes a disaster movie with endless shots of everything being blown up as our heroes stagger around, though one shot of a huge glowing meteor rolling towards them is simply phenomenal. The scenes are over-egged by an agreeable but way too overblown symphonic sturm-und-drang score by John Barry. The cast are good, but struggle to inject any dramatic dynamic into their characters (only sneaky Borgnine succeeds) because the plot doesn't allow them to. It is refreshing though to see a movie where two thirds of the way through Perkins finds out that someone else is insane. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect is a mystical ten minute finale featuring a Dantean depiction of Hell and an open-ended alternate universe - it's not quite up to 2001 A Space Odyssey but it's at least going for the same depth, and I'm sure would not conclude this way if the film were being made today. Some of the science is hokum - everybody should die as soon as the Cygnus' hull is compromised - but it's fun, interesting (We may encounter an Einstein-Rosen bridge !), has both cute and scary robots, and looks great.

Some of the science is hokum - everybody should die as soon as the Cygnus' hull is compromised - but it's fun, interesting (We may encounter an Einstein-Rosen bridge !), has both cute and scary robots, and looks great. A good movie, but for an interesting alternative version of the Cygnus\/Black Hole story, check out a couple of great songs by Rush from their late seventies back catalogue.

I loved how she played the sultry hostess while getting away with covering up being a pick pocket. This film should be considered a classic because it does bring back the glory days. All the sets and stage areas were crafted so beautifully that it was possible to lose yourself in the movie. The picture itself was not that clear and in my opinion, a little bit fuzzy.

The actors themselves played their characters well, but there could have been better interaction between them. At several points in the movie it seemed that there was no genuine interaction between the characters that were supposed to be working together. Betting and gambling was never any interest of mine so the fact that this movie revolved around that was kind of boring to me. It was fun however, watching foolish men gamble away their money in the hopes of making more on what they bet. The best part was at the beginning when Hooker and Luther pull of a con to get eleven grand from an unsuspecting target.

Here Scorsese shows remakes can be good if the right people are involved.Set in the small town of New Essex in Southern America, private practice lawyer Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) lives happily enough with his wife Leigh (Jessica Leigh) and 15-year-old daughter Danielle (Juliette Lewis), who has to go to summer school for smoking cannabis. Max Cady (Robert De Niro) had just been released from prison after serving 14 years for raping a 16-year-old girl. During his time in prison he ends up reading law books, philosophy and the bible, exercises and tattooed his body. He blames Sam for why he was sent to private and starts to stake his family, following them, killing the family pet, hoovering outside their property, basically making their live hell. He even attacks and rapes a friend of Sam who was a law clerk. Cady is also a cleaver, arrogant and psychopathic. He tries to justify his actions, plays mind games and uses the law against Sam and make him feel powerless. Sam ends up taking desperate messages, hiring a private investigator (Joe Don Baker), and even ends up using violence to try and stop Cady. Cady use mind games and even tries to get at Sam by using his daughter.This is a strong film, with Robert De Niro on form as a psycho, and Martin Scorsese direction is brilliant always. He has such a good style and wonderful shots, as well as good casting choices, especially in the supporting cast. There is a strong script and a powerful score by Elmer Bernstein. Sam is a sympathetic and well-developed character and Cady would be anyone's worst nightmare. Cady is how a stalker would functioned and use the outskirts of the law to avoid getting arrested. As well the law is shown to be hopeless like it did in real life, with the police and court sometimes targeting the wrong person. The film is about how someone could be driven to they dark side to protect their family and how someone else could be so warp in the head to justify what they have done. Cady also shows that he can be charming which proves to be a useful weapon. The film also raises a good point about rape cases, with the idea just because a victim may be promiscuous it doesn't mean someone has a right to rape her.The film is brutal and violence, which is excepted from a Scorsese film, but he never over does it. There are reasons behind it and not over done compared to say someone like the overrated Mel Gibson.However, they is one problem with this film, which is no fault of its own I kept thinking of the Simpsons' parody episode Cape Feare.4 out of 5.

He blames Sam for why he was sent to private and starts to stake his family, following them, killing the family pet, hoovering outside their property, basically making their live hell. He even attacks and rapes a friend of Sam who was a law clerk. Cady is also a cleaver, arrogant and psychopathic. He tries to justify his actions, plays mind games and uses the law against Sam and make him feel powerless. Sam ends up taking desperate messages, hiring a private investigator (Joe Don Baker), and even ends up using violence to try and stop Cady. Cady use mind games and even tries to get at Sam by using his daughter.This is a strong film, with Robert De Niro on form as a psycho, and Martin Scorsese direction is brilliant always. He has such a good style and wonderful shots, as well as good casting choices, especially in the supporting cast. There is a strong script and a powerful score by Elmer Bernstein. Sam is a sympathetic and well-developed character and Cady would be anyone's worst nightmare. Cady is how a stalker would functioned and use the outskirts of the law to avoid getting arrested. As well the law is shown to be hopeless like it did in real life, with the police and court sometimes targeting the wrong person. The film is about how someone could be driven to they dark side to protect their family and how someone else could be so warp in the head to justify what they have done. Cady also shows that he can be charming which proves to be a useful weapon. The film also raises a good point about rape cases, with the idea just because a victim may be promiscuous it doesn't mean someone has a right to rape her.The film is brutal and violence, which is excepted from a Scorsese film, but he never over does it. There are reasons behind it and not over done compared to say someone like the overrated Mel Gibson.However, they is one problem with this film, which is no fault of its own I kept thinking of the Simpsons' parody episode Cape Feare.4 out of 5.

Me, I'm the kind of guy who can appreciate a classic car, and overlook the rust spots.That's kind of where we are on this movie -- a movie that hits on seven out of eight cylinders. The problem is that romantic comedy is the most difficult of genres, and for most folks, it has to hit on all eight to work. Viewers think about their feelings; they don't analyze a romantic movie in an intellectual way, and if something doesn't quite work, they leave the theater feeling dissatisfied without knowing exactly why.This movie has so much going for it -- a good premise, clever banter, believable characters, and a romance that doesn't seem forced. And for me, there's a double appeal -- I've worked in the press\/political world, and all I can say is I can tell the writers must have been there, too.Was it miscast? Was it shallow? Was the dialog unrealistic? Was everyone too cute? Was the strange bedfellows premise beyond belief? Naah. None of that.The problem is the third act. I don't want to give away too much, but we have a scene in a bar in which Michael Keaton is given some interesting information, and he has a choice to make. Now, the movie might have spun in a half-dozen interesting directions from this point -- first time I saw it, I was half-sitting up in my chair, once I recognized where the whole thing was leading. I couldn't tell quite where it was going, but I knew it was going to be mighty interesting. There was plenty of dramatic potential, the sort you always need at the start of the third act in a comedy, to make the ending seem a happy relief.

Up to this point the movie was a clever comedy of words and ideas and romance; suddenly we got slapstick.How on earth could something like this have happened? How could writers who had done such a good job up to this point have failed so miserably at the climax? My guess is that they didn't -- my guess is that someone with a complete lack of understanding of the material took a movie with a complex, adult, and somewhat ambiguous ending, something in which there were no heroes and no villains, and decided to improve it.Or maybe a different ending was shot, and it didn't test well in Pomona, and the studio tried another approach.Or maybe the studio decided to save a little money by cutting 15 minutes out of the script.But I suspect some big-time tinkering here -- something that basically spoiled the movie for most viewers, and turned a potential classic into a bomb.Wouldn't it be cool if another ending was shot -- and if someday a director's cut might be made available?

Thanks to blu-ray technology, I can see it in beautiful high definition followed by some nice surround sound system.The visuals and special effects were very amazing for a 90's movie. And this is 1997, you wouldn't expect much from movies in the 90's in terms of nice special effects, with the exception of T2. But this movie delivered on a massive scale.Gary Oldman is the villain. Not the brightest villain, but he's cool. We have cameo appearances from trip hop artist, Tricky, as Gary Oldman's sidekick I guess? Bruce Willis, one of my favorite actors plays the role of the sarcastic action hero. He pairs up with the hot and sexy Milla Jonovich. That scene where she was created by the machines got me a little excited cause she's just so sexy. Chris Tucker is in it and he's just such a goof. It's kinda hard to tell whether he's straight or gay because of weird fashion the world of the Fifth Element serves its citizens, but nonetheless, it fit the world, because it needed something new.The plot is another save the world from the bad guy scenario, with a twist. You have this deadly planet coming for earth, which looks like an asteroid, but apparently the planet speaks because it's alien, and the main group of hero's must gather all the stones which would be placed in a temple in Egypt to stop the impending attack on earth. You have a gang of mercenary-type aliens who can shape-shift into humans and use any means of violence to accomplish their goals.The main group of hero's are also joined by a priest by British actor, Sir Ian Holm, who does a phenomenal job on his part.

So let's be frank movies like The Silence of the Lambs don't usually win very big awards, let alone Oscars (in all five of the major categories, no less, making it only the third film in history to do so).With gruesome scenes of murder, autopsies and cannibalism, it's hard to imagine The Silence of the Lambs winning Best Picture at the Oscars, not to mention heaps of praise and topping numerous best lists since its release. The Silence of the Lambs has also become a bona-fide cinematic and pop culture icon, introducing two of the most memorable characters in cinema history.The film, an adaptation of the novel by Thomas Harris, concerns the FBI's hunt for a particularly brutal serial killer, Buffalo Bill (the creepy Ted Levine), who skins his victims, mostly plus-sized women, for reasons that are too gruesome to be repeated here. The FBI puts a young trainee on the case, Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), and they have her, in turn, interview the deadly Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a cunning psychopath who remains under tight lock and key at a hospital for the criminally insane. Lecter offers to help Clarice in developing a psychological profile in order to help capture Buffalo Bill, in exchange for her confiding in him, some of her darkest and most troubling childhood memories.The Silence of the Lambs is not a film for the squeamish; I already mentioned why. But even for its scenes of grisly carnage, it's not a horror film, nor an exploitation picture that revels in scenes of outlandish gore. Instead, the real terror is more psychological we rely on the reactions of the characters for the effect. It's a technique that director Jonathan Demme found to be quite satisfactory (it was also put to effective use in the equally disturbing, and commanding serial killer thriller, Seven, four years later in 1995). Another technique that Demme put to great work here was having his actors stare directly into the camera, allowing us to become uncomfortably intimate with the on-screen action.I'm not really a fan of Jodie Foster or Anthony Hopkins, really, but their work here is nothing short of legendary. Foster is stunning as the young FBI trainee Clarice Starling, an attractive but commanding young woman who, it seems, is an adult child still reeling it in from some deeply-seeded childhood traumas, and it is through her work on the Buffalo Bill case and her meetings with Hannibal Lecter that she seems to be able to get a chance to deal with her troubled past and get some closure. Hopkins is equally commanding as the manipulative Hannibal the Cannibal, who is able to probe the mind of his young interviewee with disturbing efficiency and ease, to satisfy his own twisted curiosities that I don't think are ever really explained (that's a good thing - it makes him even scarier). These truly are, two of the most phenomenal performances in a movie that is a phenomenon upon itself.The Silence of the Lambs is purely the greatest and most terrifying thriller I've seen. However, my personal favorite thriller of all time remains Seven. But the contributions that The Silence of the Lambs made to the thriller genre, and motion picture history, are not to be overlooked. If it weren't for this film, I don't think I would've gotten Seven all those years ago.The Silence of the Lambs was recently named the greatest thriller of all time in Britain.I'll be hard-pressed to find a reason to disagree with that assertion.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 June 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I don't think a movie has really been so effective in shocking the hell out of the audience.

So let's be frank movies like The Silence of the Lambs don't usually win very big awards, let alone Oscars (in all five of the major categories, no less, making it only the third film in history to do so).With gruesome scenes of murder, autopsies and cannibalism, it's hard to imagine The Silence of the Lambs winning Best Picture at the Oscars, not to mention heaps of praise and topping numerous best lists since its release. The Silence of the Lambs has also become a bona-fide cinematic and pop culture icon, introducing two of the most memorable characters in cinema history.The film, an adaptation of the novel by Thomas Harris, concerns the FBI's hunt for a particularly brutal serial killer, Buffalo Bill (the creepy Ted Levine), who skins his victims, mostly plus-sized women, for reasons that are too gruesome to be repeated here. The FBI puts a young trainee on the case, Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), and they have her, in turn, interview the deadly Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a cunning psychopath who remains under tight lock and key at a hospital for the criminally insane. Lecter offers to help Clarice in developing a psychological profile in order to help capture Buffalo Bill, in exchange for her confiding in him, some of her darkest and most troubling childhood memories.The Silence of the Lambs is not a film for the squeamish; I already mentioned why. But even for its scenes of grisly carnage, it's not a horror film, nor an exploitation picture that revels in scenes of outlandish gore. Instead, the real terror is more psychological we rely on the reactions of the characters for the effect. It's a technique that director Jonathan Demme found to be quite satisfactory (it was also put to effective use in the equally disturbing, and commanding serial killer thriller, Seven, four years later in 1995). Another technique that Demme put to great work here was having his actors stare directly into the camera, allowing us to become uncomfortably intimate with the on-screen action.I'm not really a fan of Jodie Foster or Anthony Hopkins, really, but their work here is nothing short of legendary.

Finn is then hired as, well, a kind of playmate for ten-year-old Estella in the rotting old mansion of dotty old Mrs. Dinsmoor (Anne Bancroft). The years go by and Estelle (Gwyneth Paltrow) comes on to the now masculine and fully glandular Finn (Ethan Hawke), then turns away and leaves him flat.Out of nowhere, a lawyer shows up with a good deal of money for Finn to go to New York and establish his bona fides as an artist. In New York he encounters the nubile Estella again but after a strenuous turn in the sack she leaves him again for another man.The bitter Finn cuts a social swath through the New York art world, and a financial one too. His first gallery showing sells out. I don't personally begrudge Finn his success, although his sketches look like slightly off-angled portraits that would be thoroughly at home in a New Yorker advertisement for a commercial brokerage firm. When he sketches the scrunchible Paltrow nude, his so-called portrait is all scarlet nipples and black pudendum. (Not that there's any real nudity, alas.) No, I don't begrudge him. Not even though my own work was easily as good as his. It's true. Ask anybody. Ask my mother.Where was I? A little divagation there. Anyway, Finn turns into a snob, finds out who his benefactor is, grows into a Mensch, and goes home to that cozy dump in Floriday where his unpretentious and honest brother-in-law Chris Cooper greets him warmly and invites him in for a croaker dinner. Guess who also returns to the little village, chastened by her experiences in high society.The movie wants to be an erotic and atmospheric romance, and to hell with Charles Dickens. The novel is no more than a peg to hang the story on. Good-bye any pretense of social comment. And farewell to typical British names. All Brits have names like Percy Vetch and Doris Buckle. Yanks have good, strong, forthright names like Hiram Y. Bomboost and Choo Choo La Fevre. Come to think of it, British sandwiches are too thin. You can NOT get a decent pizza at four in the morning in John o' Groats. And they whisper over dinner instead of screaming and throwing the canolli at one another like civilized people. I have no idea why Miss Haversham of the novel became Ms. Dinsmoor in this movie or why her character has been changed from that of a bitter old maid to a colorful, gay eccentric. The closest we get to Dickens is a scene in the New York gallery that is invaded by the loud, hearty, gauche Chris Cooper, newly flown in from Florida to witness Finn's success. The scene is one of the best in the movie, even if overdrawn -- Chris Cooper as earthy life force versus the effete aesthetes. Another fine scene involves a visit Finn's benefactor makes in New York. Very nicely done by the actors and a good shot by the director -- during a tense moment on the subway an empty booze bottle rolls across the floor towards the camera. That the same shot is repeated a moment later is evidence of excess.I should mention the photography, production design, and set dressing too. They're all magnificent. Miss Dinsmoor's mansion is one of those high-ceilinged monstrosities, the interiors of which are festooned with Spanish moss and vines that look as old as the mansion itself. Even Finn's home, which he describes as poor, is colorful, spacious, and decorous. There are shots -- about four in succession -- of Finn and Estella walking across the bridges of Central Park on a fine autumn day, just as pretty as picture postcards though not suggestive of any reality you or I are likely to experience.I couldn't get with the score. Dramatic moments in Florida -- including a neat one of Estella silently inviting Finn to slip his hand up her thigh -- are backed by loud electronic guitars and a singer going OOOO OOOO. Not authentic Smithkicker music but obviously something composed for the film. Dramatic moments in New York offer operatic singers and fulsome orchestration. Under the closing credits, I was certain the theme had been lifted from Emanuelle. Gwyneth Paltrow illustrates her range as an actress. The snooty femme fatale is a little over her head. She was very impressive as the winsome, uncertain victim in Seven. Two old pros -- Robert DeNiro and the late Anne Bancroft -- turn in the best performances. Happily they were able to overcome or slough off the corny dialog We are what we are. And It's as if the past had never been. And I saw the light in her eyes. I'll tell it to you not as it was, but as I remember it. One scene towards the end is emblematic of the whole. Finn, crowned with success, is trying to find his brother-in-law on the streets of the city. He runs through a drenching downpour erratically, aiming nowhere. It's a scene that means to be full of impact but it means nothing. Just a guy running through a heavy rain. If somebody has to do it, give me Gene Kelly. I don't mean that there's anything offensive about the movie. It doesn't carry enough weight to be offensive. Everything is so pretty.

So much for the image of Victorian London as a dirty place where the population is more interested in drinking, prostitutes and other vices than in good housekeeping! There are a large number of identical characters - stunning looking prostitutes in bright dresses often giving an articulate discourse on how hard done by they are, and evil men in sober suits slashing them in dark alleyways. The film is shot from a 21st century liberal perspective, not with the values of the time.It is a few weeks since I watched this movie and I cannot say that I recollect the plot. But I can remember that I didn't find the movie worthwhile to watch at the time. ","genre":"Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"7 June 2009","score":"","review":" After being sexually molested by her gynecologist (who later commits suicide when others accuse him of the same thing), Claire Barton seems to have it all a few months later-a beautiful house, loving husband and two lovely children (including the new born baby). All she needs is a nanny to help around the house. And she finds the perfect person in the form of Peyton Flanders. But her perfect life soon begins to fall apart...is it the nanny's fault? I first saw The Hand That Rocks the Cradle on its initial theatrical release and loved it at that time. With several viewings since, my enjoyment of this film has not decreased. It is an excellent and disturbing thriller that holds my attention throughout its run time without ever becoming dull and that still leaves me with a deep sense of unease.The story is quite simple and there are not a lot of twists and turns, yet it is interesting. And the settings are nice and effective in helping set the mood of the picture.But it is the acting that really makes this movie stand out. Rebecca De Mornay is perfect as the psychotic nanny who tries to make the baby and the rest of the family (except Claire) her own. She is absolutely convincing in this role. There is a scene when Claire (Annabella Sciorra) is returning home from the hospital and Peyton (De Mornay) believes she has won and the family is here-De Mornay's acting is just completely convincing in her change of role from the nanny to the lady of the house. Just fantastic. Annabella Sciorra is also excellent as the desperate mother whose life is falling apart. And of course, I'm always a great Julianne Moore fan, who is great as Claire's best friend Marlene. Ernie Hudson is charming and likable, if not completely believable, as the mentally challenged handyman.Overall, this is a great movie that never gets dull and just improves with each viewing.

A New Hope was pretty good and The Empire Strikes Back was good but not great. For my money, Return of the Jedi is the one to beat.The plot ties up all the stories and loose ends that we've seen develop and also provides the best ending in any of these six films. The others either ended on an overblown note or a bittersweet one. Jedi has a nice, subtle happy ending. The story this time is that the Death Star II is nearing completion which leads to a final showdown between the Empire and the Rebels. While all this is going on, Luke becomes determined to redeem the soul of his father-Darth Vader.The performers are simply terrific. Mark Hamill does a great job (probably his best on-camera performance) Carrie Fisher turns in another great job as the beautiful yet spunky Princess Leia and Harrison Ford, although somewhat superfluous to the main story, turns in another first rate job.The veteran actors- Alec Guinness, Sebastian Shaw and Ian McDiarmid- are all perfect although I consider Shaw to be the stand-out. Last but not least, Frank Oz as Yoda who goes out with one of the best death scenes ever.With a few exceptions (the Ewoks, the slave girl outfit) this is a fantastic film with great characters, slick special effects and a touching story. Plus some good old fashioned puppet effects bringing our favorite space slug, Jabba the Hutt, to life.In short, Jedi rules.

It is already well in the top 100 films on IMDb, so it's obviously a very good film.Instead of the usual view of the film, I'll talk about it from a psychological perspective. Amélie is a nice lady who is severely hindered by an Avoidant Personality. This means that she's so worried about being rejected by others that she always keeps her distance from them--particularly anyone who could become intimate. In other words, instead of being actively involved with others, she lives a life of quiet desperation--hoping that somehow things will work themselves out but completely terrified to act. So, she sublimates her energy into doing things to help others--but always at a distance and anonymously. Most of the things she does for others are very quirky and strange--but ultimately very helpful and kind. In one of the cases, however, she attempts to gain retribution for an emotionally abused young man through passive-aggressive actions. Fortunately for her, she meets a man who is also Avoidant (his hobby is very detached yet shows an interest in others)...but how can two such obvious misfits who are afraid of commitment find a way to connect?! Aside from the psychological aspects of the film, I really appreciated the look of the film. The odd 1930s style of Amélie's clothing and the homes in the film, the choice of colors (with lots of sepia tones), the cinematic tricks and the quirky little gimmicks (such as the pictures and lamp in her room coming to life) all help to make this a magical picture that you cannot forget.Overall, a delight. Oddly, however, despite the very high rating, I think that Audrey Tautou mas made better films, such as HE LOVES ME...HE LOVES ME NOT and A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT.

This one however only took me half way to the finish line. Maybe it had to do with the involvement of space aliens and giant pods, but more so I think with the virtually one sided opinion expressed by most of the central characters that giving up everything they have to live forever was the 'right thing to do' (sorry, that's just the way it came out, I wasn't thinking of Wilford Brimley's commercials).The set-up with Brimley's character you see, seemed to be pointing entirely in the other direction. The relationship with his grandson begged for a thorough soul searching moment in which Ben (Brimley) would decide in favor of staying put to share in the the joys of watching his fishing partner grow up and become a man. Sure, there was that one moment of doubt that was discussed with wife Mary (Maureen Stapleton), but it was dismissed rather quickly. Ultimately, I came away feeling that Ben's decision was somewhat selfish. Additionally, the way the picture ended, with the young boy gazing happily heavenward, didn't ring true for me. After all, he would grow old and die someday, while his grandparents were tooling around the universe in immortality.Without the whole alien pod subtext, I think the picture would have shown greater promise. There's nothing wrong with experiencing the sublime and magical, and if it makes you feel young again, so much the better. There may be 'better' things to do than running around the backyard with my own grandson as he tries to squirt me with his water gun, and falling down when he 'gets me'. But I don't think I'd want to give that up for a shot at living forever if I had to miss the experience.I'm reminded of a 1962 Rod Serling 'Twilight Zone' episode titled 'Kick the Can' that also took place in a nursing home. In that one, a senior citizen believes he's found the secret of youth in playing children's games. As in Cocoon, there's another resident like Bernie (Jack Gilford) who remains a hold out, in favor of acting his own age. The story ends when the old man realizes he missed his opportunity to be a kid again, as he watches his friends skip off into the darkness to revive their youth. That mere twenty five minute story holds a lot more poignancy for me than Cocoon, and as support, I've remembered it for forty years since I first saw it.
