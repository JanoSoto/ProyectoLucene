Such a large budget production with major stars in the lead roles as gay men led to a great deal of compromising. I suppose this was a 'necessary evil.'The film and arts community is quite familiar with homosexuality and with the beginning of the AIDS epidemic. This film is, therefore, more about homosexuality than it is about AIDS. We have had many many films devoted to people with AIDS but when dealing with both subjects (homosexuality and AIDS) a different light is cast on both.Whether it is because people think of homosexuals being responsible for AIDS or they just feel uncomfortable with homosexuality is debatable.This movie could have been about a homosexual being fired from a job and it would not have had the same resonance. There is a bit of 'pity the homosexual with AIDS' atmosphere to the film.The two subjects are related (in some people's minds).  But now that AIDS is affecting the general population, the relation can and maybe should be severed.This movie never really tells us if Tom Hanks employer is prejudiced against homosexuals, people with AIDS or both.So, one may watch the movie and separate viewpoints. Is it about a homosexual having problems, an AIDS patient having problems or both?This is the very frustrating part of this film. That the performers in this film felt a 'duty' to make it is a bit too obvious. That the backers of the film are a bit squeamish is also very obvious. There are no real 'love scenes ' or anything to offend sensitive Tom Hanks or Antonio Banderas fans watching the film. I'm sure that the backers were afraid of driving away their audience with too much realism on the subject.Aside from these obvious faults, the film's production values and acting are faultless.  The casting of Mary Steenburgen as the attorney for the opposition was inspired.  At one point, she says 'I hate this case.'  One wonders why she took it then.  But her courtroom demeanor as a gentle yet insidious advocate for the bigots should have won her an oscar. Tom Hanks description of opera to Denzel Washington was a true pice of virtuoso acting. And the writers were (or were not) smart enough not to have given Joanne Woodward more scenes.  Every time she appears on screen, it's as if a spotlight is on her alone.  This is not done intentionally by Woodward or the director.  She is a natural phenomenon and one of America's most underrated actresses. The film is worth seeing for her two (relatively small) scenes alone.

The only chance a studio has is to compare it to other bad films that somehow became popular with a less discriminating audience, namely the teen audience.  Jawbreakers is a film (and I use that term loosely) that appears to have been made by a group of kids attempting to make their own version of teen hits.  Not a better version mind you, or a different version; it seems their attempt was to just make the same version (or combination therof) that they have already seen on the video shelves.  Even such a low goal was not met.  The film is bad. This film is not in the so bad it's funny range (if only it were), it's in the so bad it's embarrassing range.  The acting is bad.  The script is bad.  Or is the film completely improvised?  It's tough to tell.  The direction is non-existent.  The production design, though very unoriginal would be the highlight just because it's not as bad.  The concept is copied from Heathers, endless Friday the 13th parodies of the 1980's and an old Saturday Night Live sketch (one of those that end up AFTER the news update and are cut from the syndicated re-runs and featuring someone who is currently dead) all performed by your local high-school theatrical class--you know one of those performances only a parent would buy a ticket to but worth getting out of Algebra class for.)  Walking out of the theater after watching this film makes you feel like a dope for being there and embarrassed if anyone sees you.  Imagine getting caught going into a Barney, the Purple Dinosaur flick WITHOUT escorting a young child and you begin to get the idea.  If you do go, wear dark sunglasses, a raincoat, and a big hat.  You don't want your reputation ruined.  Better yet, just put a sign on your back that reads I'm an Idiot!, it's less embarrassing.  Of course, you could stay home and watch that Barney film on video, at least no one will see you.

It's a credulous incredible storytelling of a young brother and sister in Tehran, and the adventurous saga around one very important pair of sneakers.The two young actors are amazing -- they play their guileless naïve sensitivity with such earnestness! Central character, Ali, the 9 year old brother, is Mir Farrokh Hashemian, who really carried the film with his legwork, and the younger sister Zahra is Bahareh Seddiqui, who contributed her restrained share of screen presence. The pair is so natural those furrowed faces, anxious knitted brows -- the range of sad faces the two came up with! The bond between the brother and sister is so warm and joyful - in spite of misfortunes.The storyline is seemingly simple. Such story-weaving knack writer-director Majid Majidi has -- he can make chasing along a streaming gutter into an intense dramatic episode! The story has the texture likened to a Thomas Hardy novel (poverty setting, episode after episode, turn of events), yet such a relishingly simple delivery. He doesn't have to tell it all on the screen -- little nuances and observations suffice.It's heartening to see young children who are polite and respectful to their elders, responsible and caring in dealing with their everyday problems, and not give up -- such quiet fortitude in spite of disappointments, such tolerance of their circumstance yet still able to find joy in little things. We catch a smile here and there, e.g., when they enjoy the impromptu soap bubbles, or when he encouraged his sister by giving her small tokens.This is an absolute gem of a family (value) film. Children's emotions untapped, yet adults are not left out -- touches of  grown-up connections the parents, the elderly couple next door, the shop-owners, all made this world very real.The camerawork, and the well-designed use of sound mixed with accompanying music (different tonal quality instruments were applied) complemented this cinematic experience. A poetic ending -- there's a serenity about it all.I hope Children of Heaven will win this year's 71st Academy Award Best Foreign Film Oscar -- it will receive its due exposure and more people will experience this gem.Along the lines of poverty and shoes, I thought of  the Italian 1978's The Tree of the Wooden Clogs by writer-director Ermanno Olmi. And, on a story with substance and good acting by an Iranian young boy, there's 1989's Bashu, The Little Stranger, by writer-director Bahram Beizai. Both are movies to be appreciated.

This is not a matter of squeamishness  most of the film is seen through the eyes of a 14-year-old boy, a reluctant 'witness' (well, he's usually on the other side of the door) to the various plots, sub-plots and counter-plots. On second thoughts, the gangster boss here is NASTIER than anything in the Godfather. That point doesn't immediately sink in, because the film is so BEAUTIFUL, a real feast for the eyes, and because the final twist in the story - in my case, anyway - has a delayed impact. It's one of those films you need to see again, armed with the knowledge of how it is going to turn out - like The Usual Suspects.

Of course, the STAR WARS references are funny, but I also liked the I love you speech Holden made to Alyssa.  And that relationship was really well drawn out as well, showing Smith to be an expert on writing guys who can't handle women who are sexually experienced, yet are not bad guys. Affleck is good as Holden, but the real surprise here is Adams as Alyssa. She brings the right amount of humor, spunk, and vulnerability to the role, and she should have received an Oscar nomination.

This film noir is another example of that.  This may be a familiar tale about, as the tagline says, no honor among thieves, but Rafelson and the writers make this more character driven than you'd expect, except for the nanny played by Jennifer Lopez, who seems like just a plot device.  So when events in the plot happen, they don't happen because of plot manipulation, but because that's how we believe the characters would react in that situation.Nicholson and Caine are good as men who feel trapped, Nicholson by an unhappy family life and a business going down the tubes, and Caine by his dying body.  So their viciousness (and Caine in particular acts vicious) comes from desperation more than just sadism.  Judy Davis is good in almost everything I see her, and she's good here, playing a surprisingly complex character.  I wasn't a big fan of Stephen Dorff until his turn in I SHOT ANDY WARHOL, but he continues his good work from that film with his performance here.
