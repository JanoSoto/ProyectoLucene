I sort of wonder also why the character in The Clone Wars series actually seems to be more noble than the rash and hot headed youth that we see in this film.A final point that I wish to make is that I find it interesting that certain groups protested heavily against Harry Potter, mainly for its use of magic and its appeal to children, but remained almost silent on these films. The reason I raise that is because of Anakin's origins, namely that he did not have a father.

I don't see all the fuss about him or why he is so revered and loved by the IMDb crowd. He makes quality entertainment and makes you think from time to time but that hardly qualifies him as a great director. He has yet to make something that will stick into my mind or affect me in a certain way. His style of directing isn't very interesting and he mostly relies on narrative gimmicks which rarely work for me. Because of that his films nearly always feel dry, mechanical and bore me. But Insomnia was different.I really liked Insomnia quite a bit. I have not seen the original film on which it was based off, so I'm not going to compare them. Many people consider Insomnia Christopher Nolan's weakest film, mostly because it's a basic crime thriller with no gimmicks or other tricks Mr. Nolan likes to use. I like crime thrillers and Insomnia is one of the better ones from the last decade. It mostly comes down to two stellar performances from veteran actors Al Pacino and Robin Williams. I'm a big fan of Al Pacino and he gives a very subtle performance which is kind of rare from him in last two decades. I love the scenery chewing Scarface and Heat Pacino as much as the Godfather, Serpico or Dog Day Afternoon one. The guy can do no wrong in my eyes even if he stars in Jack and Jill. And because of him, Insomnia works so well. Robin Williams was a real discovery for me. Who knew a talented comedian could play a very creepy killer? I always knew that he was a good actor, if given the right material and here he just rocks. The scenes between Pacino and Williams are so good, that it elevates the somewhat predictable plot and the Hollywood ending.As I mentioned before Insomnia is pretty basic crime thriller without big twists or shocking endings. This isn't Infernal Affairs or Se7en or any other complex crime thriller. You will not be caught off guard by the ending or anything at all. Actually, this plot will remind you of infinite numbers of crime stories told in literature, film and TV. Another problem for the film is Hillary Swank. I'm not a big fan of her and I thought she was miscast as the rookie cop. In every film she has been in she has this same grin and acts like herself. It also might be that Mr. Nolan didn't direct her well. His movies usually are plagued with flat and boring performances like Christian Bale, Katie Holmes, Leonardo DiCaprio or some really good ones like Michael Caine, Heath Ledger and Guy Pearce. It's hard to decipher whether Hillary Swank can't act or Nolan isn't good actor's director.Insomnia looks good, I liked the setting it took place; the supporting cast aside from Hillary Swank were fine. It's well made, has a good pacing and a great atmosphere. However I have a feeling that this script would have suited better David Fincher rather than Christopher Nolan. The dark tone and these characters would have suited Fincher's hand much better.Overall Insomnia is enjoyable film with excellent performances from Al Pacino and Robin Williams. If you enjoy good crime thrillers with so good psychological element to them and an interesting setting, it's must see. But don't expect anything groundbreaking or that impressive from it.

For those reasons, I hadn't seen it since I was a kid. Watching it again years later, not only did I realize just how good a movie it is, but I also found that I took a lot more out of it. While being widely considered as one of the best mafia movies of all time, A Bronx Tale actually has a deeper meaning, which is not to waste the talent you have in the time you are given. I was also surprised to learn that this story is in fact the true story of Chazz Palminteri's childhood, with Chazz being a nickname for Calogero. For those of you who don't know the story, it's about the son of a bus driver, who grows up in the Bronx, right down the block from a mafia hangout. While this boy learns different things from his real family and his mafia family, who are always at odds, they actually both want the same things for this kid. A Bronx Tale isn't just another gangster movie, there is some of that, but it's really an inspirational coming of age tale that I found to be very eye opening. The cast is of course fantastic, featuring Robert De Niro, who directs and stars in the film, along with Palminteri, who wrote the film. The true irony of A Bronx Tale is surrounded by the true story of Lillo Brancato, the boy who plays Calogero. As I said the story is about discovering right from wrong and not wasting your talent, something Brancato did when he was convicted of an armed robbery, which led to the death of an off-duty police officer. There are many sides to that, but I felt it necessary to mention how ironic it is that the message of the film is actually lost on one it's stars. In closing, A Bronx Tale really is a lost gem, that lives up to all the hype, and I hope that now that's streaming on Netflix, a whole new generation will be exposed to the message it puts out there for them to hear.

The main character - Henry - is surely a modern day version of Buster Keaton. You really do feel that there is a nod to the silent films era, not only with the visuals but with the humour, most of which is unerringly black. There are many set pieces in the film which serve to both unnerve and amuse you in equal measure, which in itself makes for quite an unsettling experience. The supporting cast are nothing short of excellent. There are several other reviews out there which label this film as groundbreaking and I would say that that label is certainly justified. It will be obvious to those viewing this that certain directors of certain movies now regarded as classics will have had the seeds of an idea from this movie. For those die-hard Lynch fans out there, you will LOVE this film. For those who have never entered the bizarre world of the director, you will certainly take something from this.

They go on a huge quest to find their master, along which they meet overly curious squirrels and evil, misleading, top-of-the-line appliances, travel through dark woods, and of course the all-too-well-known scrapheap.There are very dark scenes in this movie, yes.

And concerning the supposed strong language (i.e. idiot and stupid) it's not like they will never learn those words. Anyway,the scrapheap scene (and the Worthless song) is something that really stuck with me for my whole life ever since I saw it. It's fairly gruesome.

After I first watched it, I found it a very confusing film that, to me, wasn't that good. But then, after thinking about it for a while, it all makes sense, and comes together. This is a film you having to watch twice - and films you have to watch twice are always good.What Ridley Scott has created here is a believable, stunning and dark portrayal of the future. Keep in mind that the buildings in most of the film were not done with CGI, but were real models. For something that doesn't use CGI this is truly an achievement - and this was done in 1982.The characters are, after a second viewing, easy to empathise with and develop incredibly well as the story goes on. While for some there isn't much character development, I would say that actually for the experience of the film it's not necessary. Most of these characters are replicants, by the way - they don't have much of a life anyway.as for the story, this is where many give up. It's slow, basic, yet it works so well in the setting created. It gives the viewer time to think and work out everything, and for many (including me) you'll need that! Most Sci-Fi films of today's age are way to quick. They're certainly good, but few really have the power and emotion that this film delivers.Talking of power and emotion, there is one big reason why this film is so good - it leaves you questioning. Films that literally have an affect on you (The Matrix or Inception are other good examples) are hard to pull off, but here it is done seemingly. You are blasted with subliminal messages throughout the film - don't worry, not bad ones. They are far, far more realistic, such us where the most common person is from (China, hint hint), who is advertising and how, who is living on the streets and who is booming, class gaps, wealth and so on. Ridley doesn't doesn't just produce an amazing film, he produces a stunning, realistic world that, in some parts of this world, doesn't actually seem hat far off. This film is more than just a story. It's incredible because in the space of 2 hours, we see a dark, grimy future and a retired cop, doing one last job, being put through a tough job in a huge city, that actually has a mental affect on you. What those affects are, is up to you - and that is another reason why this film is so good. It doesn't give opinions on itself, it generates individual ones. Compare the opinions of die-hard fans and they'll all come up with something different. In conclusion then, this is an incredible film that has really redefined it's genre, and redefined a whole sci-fi community with just how clever, realistic and powerful this film is. if you love sci-fi you have to watch this.

For something that doesn't use CGI this is truly an achievement - and this was done in 1982.The characters are, after a second viewing, easy to empathise with and develop incredibly well as the story goes on. While for some there isn't much character development, I would say that actually for the experience of the film it's not necessary. Most of these characters are replicants, by the way - they don't have much of a life anyway.as for the story, this is where many give up. It's slow, basic, yet it works so well in the setting created. It gives the viewer time to think and work out everything, and for many (including me) you'll need that! Most Sci-Fi films of today's age are way to quick. They're certainly good, but few really have the power and emotion that this film delivers.Talking of power and emotion, there is one big reason why this film is so good - it leaves you questioning. Films that literally have an affect on you (The Matrix or Inception are other good examples) are hard to pull off, but here it is done seemingly. You are blasted with subliminal messages throughout the film - don't worry, not bad ones. They are far, far more realistic, such us where the most common person is from (China, hint hint), who is advertising and how, who is living on the streets and who is booming, class gaps, wealth and so on. Ridley doesn't doesn't just produce an amazing film, he produces a stunning, realistic world that, in some parts of this world, doesn't actually seem hat far off. This film is more than just a story. It's incredible because in the space of 2 hours, we see a dark, grimy future and a retired cop, doing one last job, being put through a tough job in a huge city, that actually has a mental affect on you. What those affects are, is up to you - and that is another reason why this film is so good. It doesn't give opinions on itself, it generates individual ones. Compare the opinions of die-hard fans and they'll all come up with something different. In conclusion then, this is an incredible film that has really redefined it's genre, and redefined a whole sci-fi community with just how clever, realistic and powerful this film is. if you love sci-fi you have to watch this. Probably twice though.10\/10 ","genre":"Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"2 January 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" No pun intended but this film is a blast. I only recently became aware of it and promptly decided to order it up via my local library. For someone like myself who lived through most of the era represented in these archival clips, it's a wistful, melancholy trip down memory lane. Like so many others growing up in the Fifties I remember quite vividly how we'd practice those duck and cover drills and stockpile canned goods in a secure room at school in case we found ourselves under attack by those pesky Russkies. The film instructively takes us on a chronological journey from the end of World War II through the Cold War paranoia of the Fifties and Sixties showing how the threat of nuclear war was to be taken seriously, or at least as seriously as the government would have us believe. You know, even as a kid I had a pretty good idea that kneeling next to a wall and covering my head with my hands would make me a goner if the real thing ever happened.One of the more surreal moments offered here was that near rabid clergyman exhorting families with a fallout shelter to deny access to outsiders lest they imperil their own safety. It brought to mind that 1961 Twilight Zone episode 'The Shelter' which pretty much laid out the same scenario with some modification. In the story, a family man who built and supplied his own fallout shelter was besieged by his neighbors to allow them entry when the dreaded siren heralded a nuclear attack. The story demonstrated just how ugly people can become when faced with their own mortality; it was one of Rod Serling's better scripts.In terms of sheer absurdity (and there were numerous examples), the suggestion that doubled me over had to do with providing a bottle of tranquilizers for an extended period in a bomb shelter. How else to contend with the paranoia and boredom of being cooped up while waiting for an emergency to be over. Which would be good advice if you had the foresight to locate your shelter at least twelve miles away from ground zero because otherwise you'd be toast. By the way, a bottle of a hundred would be about right.For those of you interested in this type of stuff, the copy of The Atomic Cafe I watched came in a two DVD set from Docurama Films. The bonus disc features yet another eight government propaganda shorts from the era including 1951's 'Duck and Cover' with Bert the Turtle, and what looks like a must see - 'Self Preservation in an Atomic Attack'. For a more in depth treatment of the Bikini Atoll nuclear test, I'd recommend the 1988 documentary Radio Bikini.

Every time you've heard of people sleeping with da fishies or making an offer you can't refuse, it'll all boil back to this classic, highly-tutted film.On first glance, I dismissed the film as being rather dull, despite a few standout moments. On repeat viewings, I have found it more compelling. The film is most memorable for the scenes everybody knows and loves the scene with the horse's head, the street fighting scene, Marlon Brando's mumbling, the restaurant shooting, sporadic bursts of gunfights and violence...it's all there. Dialogue dominates most of the film, but when given due attention, the story can be rather gripping and mesmerizing. At this point, the only drag I've felt is in the last thirty minutes or so; the film just kinda winds down after nearly 150 minutes of epic-scale gangster mayhem.The story is long, dense, and chock full of quality characterizations. The film does a fine job of keeping its events in order so that the politics of each situation makes some kind of sense. What matters the most will be the characters, who are endearing, and the underlying themes of family, honor, and loyalty. Family and generations are probably the most blatant themes, especially since most scenes show some strong contrast (or perhaps comparisons) between adults and children.As a film, it looks really classy. Photography never was a huge standout for these films, but the sepia tones and framing lends the movie a type of classic family-portrait appeal. Editing is decent. Acting is probably the biggest virtue here. Marlon Brando chews the scenery, despite his mumbling and constant fiddling with things, he does show endless nuance and expressions that brings Vito Corleone to life really well. Al Pacino must be at his most nuanced as Michael, and the rest of the magnificent cast fulfills their parts well. Writing is decent. This production has good-looking sets, props, and costumes, and is especially noteworthy for its period reproduction. Music is nice too.Everybody should see this at least once in their lifetime.4\/5 (Entertainment Pretty Good | Story Good | Film Perfect) ","genre":null},{"date":"2 January 2013","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This film has spawned so many gangster clichés and parodies that it's not even funny.

When they get there, they discover a weird book and some tapes. The tapes belonged to an archaeologist who was studying the book and came to the cabin to not get distracted by anything at home, he explains how he believes this to be the book of the dead, or Necronomicon, itself. He managed to translate some of the writings and speaks them out loud of the tapes. The words summon demons to the cabin that slowly possess each of the friends one by one until the lone survivor, Ash, has to fight off the rest of the demons and somehow escape from woods alive.Now, as soon as you see the phrase 'group of buddies' in the context of a horror movie, you want to roll your eyes. Yeah, it's a horror movie cliché to have a bunch of boring and unlikable teens just there for the sake of getting killed. But wait! We actually care for their characters. Okay, they're not exactly three-dimensional Shakespeare characters but at least they are decent characters. Especially the relationship between Ash and his girlfriend, Linda. They're an adorable couple that you want to see live but it all ends in tragedy as the demons use Linda to torment Ash.The rest of the film? Really unique. There are very few films out there that can take place in one small space and hold my attention the entire running time. The cinematography is fantastic, with some shots really making you wonder how the hell they managed to do them. The atmosphere is fantastic, with very little music and more emphasis on sound effects. The wind blowing outside, the floorboards creaking, the squelchy noises the blood makes as the characters walk through them. Great stuff. The cabin itself is very creepy. If I saw anything like it in real life, I would just stay far away. It's widely known that the movie was on a really tight budget and the crew found the cabin abandoned in the forest. Knowing that makes it a whole more creepier.The effects are jaw-dropping and a true testament that practical effects will always beat CGI. The way the demons look, the white stuff they spray out of their mouth when they are stabbed or shot, the ridiculous amount of blood almost literally coming out the woodwork and the stop-motion finale.It's also pretty inspiring when you watch or read a lot of stuff that went on behind-the-scenes. How some of the effects where done, the hell the crew persevered through, the ridiculous controversy it caused especially in the UK but is now considered a horror classic. I highly recommend watching documentaries on the film if you have an interest in film making.Is there anything bad about the movie? Of course there is. While I did mention the characters were decent, the acting is a bit bland. Even Bruce Campbell as Ash who has become one of the biggest cult movie stars is nothing to write home about in this movie but when the characters become possessed, then they turn up the ham dial all the way up to 100 and it becomes far more entertaining. I also don't think I need to say anything about the infamous tree rape scene. It's just out of place even in a movie as crazy as 'Evil Dead.' Well, that's my take on it. If you haven't seen it, do me a favour and do it soon. It's one of the most creative, original, entertaining and greatest movies of all time.
