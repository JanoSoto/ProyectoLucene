The beginning of the movie wasn't really good and most of all very predictable, but in the end it all got a bit better and more interesting to watch.A few Eastern European guys try to rob a museum and get in by copying the idea of the Trojan Horse (I guess everybody knows the ancient Greek legend, but for those who don't they are smuggled inside the museum in the belly of a gigantic statue of a horse). They do some special burglar stuff, cut some wires, get to the paintings,... but than something goes wrong and they are caught by the police. But even though they were caught, one painting is missing. Of course the police immediately starts an investigation and a mysterious lady, Catherine Olds Banning, suddenly appears. She works for some Swiss insurers and she will monitor the case closely and try to find the thief, because her employers aren't very eager to pay. She soon finds a suspect, Thomas Crown. Thomas Crown is a multi-millionaire and successful playboy with a rare hobby stealing expensive works of art. He finds himself much too clever for the police, but he is eager to participate in the cat-and-mouse game that Banning, in which he sees a worthy adversary, wants to play with him...My main problem with the movie was the predictability, especially in the beginning. Of course she will do anything to catch him and ignore the rules made up by the police. Of course he'll show off with all his richness and seduce her. Of course she will fall in love with him. I can't really say that such a script is very original or even very clever. It has been done so many times before and will be done even more in the future. However, that doesn't mean that the movie didn't have any clever parts. For instance the part where he wants to return the painting and uses a painting by René Magritte, a Belgian surrealist painter, as a source of inspiration is absolutely brilliant.What I also liked was the fact that Pierce Brosnan was casted as the classy, elegant and sophisticated millionaire \/ playboy. He really played that role very well. The other characters however weren't all that excellent. I wasn't really blown away by the performances of Denis Leary, Rene Russo or Frankie Faison. They stood in Brosnan's shadow from the beginning and never were able to get out of it. In the end this was a quite good, entertaining and fast-paced movie, but far from a masterpiece. It had too many plot holes (for example where does Catherine Olds Banning, immediately after the robbery come from when nobody told her what happened or asked her to come to the museum? She just shows up.) and the acting wasn't always excellent. I give it a 6.5\/10, but certainly nothing more than that.

So this early Sixties sci-fi actioner would give me a chance to evaluate an actor who has been something of an enigma for me.

When they re-emerge after a few days under the ice, you'll never guess what happened? The Van Allen radiation belt surrounding the earth somehow caught fire (the what?) and it's up to the Admiral and his crew to save the world by launching a nuke into the ring of fire surrounding the Earth. Naturally, not everyone agrees (especially the Lenin-lookalike scientist who basically proposes to look at it and wish for itself to burn out) and when the crew of the Seaview begin to question the Admiral, led by upstart Captain Crane (Robert Sterling), the vessel has trouble inside and outside the sub to content with.There's no disguising that the fact that the story is a load of old cobblers. Not only is Admiral Nelson a top scientist as well, he plans to launch the nuke in the face of other scientific evidence that would suggest the annihilation of mankind would result from his actions. Reminded me of the current President but anyway... the film's real strengths are the performances wrought out of the actors and the amazing set-design.

Sure, it's easily the least of the five movies, but it's still entertaining and has something to say, which is a quality that's usually missing with most fifth entries of a long franchise, and definitely in science fiction films in general these days.It's now some years after the events of CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES, and we learn that much has happened in the interim; most importantly, man must have pushed a panic button during the subsequent ape wars, as much of the Earth (or at least the North American section of it) has become radioactive wasteland, thanks to the detonation of some kind of bomb. BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES centers on one small community of survivors - who are not necessarily supposed to be considered the entire world population, as so many detractors mistake when they like to condemn its small budget - but just a relatively modest group of apes and humans in one specific area who try to re-build their lives in peace. Can it ever be done?Roddy McDowall returns as Caesar, who is more benevolent than he was in CONQUEST, but still has trouble completely trusting humans at this point in time - and even, as he grows to learn, some apes! Probably due to that plague that befell the world decades ago, the simians are still increasing in speech and intelligence at an incredible rate. While apes are the dominant species in this particular neighborhood, humans are treated with at least a moderate amount of respect, except by self-appointed gorilla general Aldo (Claude Akins), who would prefer to exterminate all of mankind instead of tolerating them.There's still a point to the series, although by now it has reached the level of repetition -- will man and ape ever be able to survive together as equals? Not only do Aldo and his gorillas despise the humans of their own village, but a group of mutated human survivors from the old city are still alive and vow to wage war on Caesar's tranquil little town. It should also be noted that there was a very poignant subplot originally filmed which involved the mutants and their devotion to an Alpha\/Omega bomb (making these beings the likely ancestors of the ones we'd later see in BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES). Without these scenes, the film isn't as intelligent as it might have otherwise been, and as of this writing the footage has only been made available on a Japanese laserdisc.I think the casting was wonderful this time around. I mean, was Claude Akins perfect for a gorilla general or what? And Paul Williams was a natural for his part as Virgil, the wise little orangutan. John Huston as the Lawgiver and Lew Ayres as Mandemus were also interesting choices.Yes, again the money was still tight for this chapter, so those expecting a huge blown-out, full scale war should be advised that it's more along the lines of ... well, a battle. The movie is supposed to take place in a barren, scantily populated wasteland; why so much more money was thought to be needed under those circumstances is beyond me.As a big fan of the APES films, I waited almost 30 years for Twentieth Century-Fox to revisit this series. There were still plenty of possibilities that could have been explored what other forms of life and civilizations still existed in other locations throughout America? Whatever happened to apes and people over in the other countries? Apparently, none of that mattered to Fox. Like many, I guess they just don't get  this saga. Instead, when they finally got around to making another film it was yet another needless re-imagining that was rushed out with no idea as to what made these films so engaging to those who liked them in the first place.

I don't like this kind of movies to be too sweet (a problem that you'll encounter too often in this genre). I only want a lot of sugar in my coffee, not in the movies that I watch. Serendipity isn't too sweet. It has the perfect mix of humor and romance, which keeps it all interesting from the beginning until the end.A man and a woman, who don't know each other, meet for the first time during their Christmas shopping, when they both want to buy the same pair of gloves. Because only one of them can have the gloves, they decide that the 'winner' will pay the other one a coffee in a coffee house nearby, which is called Serendipity. They have a great time together, but at the end she refuses to give him her phone number. As a great believer in fate, she believes that if they are meant for each other, fate will bring them back together anyway. She writes down her number and name in a book that she'll sell the next day. He'll have to write his number on a 5-dollar note. If he finds the book or if she gets the banknote, they will see each other again, if not, this will be their only encounter. Many years go by and they have never seen each other again.

Perhaps it is just the dubbing, but the acting is quite lousy. Jessica Harper, and some of the older actresses, suit their roles very well yet for the most part the acting verges on being laughable. As well, the pace should be somewhat faulted as there are a great deal of moments that could have been cut out to make it a better movie.When I truly think for myself about this film these are the only problems that I can think of. Certainly these are problems that must be mentioned, yet there is so much that I love in this film. For one, I actually quite enjoy the plot of it. It is simple, yet built up in a way that is exciting and sensible (to some degree). The score is terrifying, though quite repetitive. It is quite an intense piece of music that that band Goblin wrapped together, I must say.As for why this is perhaps my favorite horror movie of all time, save maybe Dawn of the Dead or The Shining, let me rave for a while. This film is like an extremely violent acid trip. The color is completely out of this world, making you feel as though you are part of something truly supernatural or alien. As well, the 'story behind the story' is really really cool and I found it to be somewhat creepy. There are certain scenes, even non violent ones, that just freak me out. Like the scene where Suzy is in the dancing room amidst some horrible sickness. It honestly seems as though she is being literally forced to dance by some strange power in the school.I don't even need to say that this film is atmospheric because that is something that is just known by all horror fans. What I need to say is that it really is quite terrifying. Despite the lack of emotional depth the film remains an emotional experience for me. Maybe I'm just a wacko, but I really really get into this film when I watch it. It is the most violent and elegant piece of horror that I have ever seen in my entire life. There are certain images in this movie that completely haunt me. And yes, the last 12 minutes of Suspiria are completely horrifying.I think perhaps the reason that I love this film so much was that it is the film that made me fall head over heals for horror. I had always been a fan of horror to some degree, but when I saw this it turned into more of a full on fascination. It sometimes leaves me with sleeping troubles to see this movie.

In truth, when considering depth of character or social commentary or whatnot, the film does not seem to have so much substance. But when you get beyond this and see it as some sort of a weird nightmarish supernatural world then the style in a way becomes the substance and you just have to let yourself get taken away by it. Sure the plot can be slow and certain moments perhaps would have been better left out, but it is actually something of an engaging story as well. The ending is pure genius, not only because it has the power to scare the living dead out of me, but because it comes together so well. It is perhaps the most powerful ending that I have ever seen in a horror movie, save perhaps the ending of The Exorcist (which is powerful in a different way).So, if Suspiria is not your kind of thing but you still want to give horror a chance I would recommend something like The Exorcist or maybe some of those old Roger Gorman Poe adaptations.

He crash-lands in the same vicinity as his friend, and goes through a similar nightmare when he comes to discover that the planet he's stranded on is dominated by intelligent, talking apes with a decidedly low opinion of mankind.

Luckily, Brent runs into Taylor's mate, Nova (Linda Harrison looking prettier than she did in PLANET) and she is able to lead him to kindly chimpanzee couple, Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (David Watson this time; Roddy McDowall was busy directing a film). The pacifistic simians try to help their human friends along their journey to find Taylor, but Brent and Nova only succeed in getting themselves captured by gorillas anyway.Up to this midway point in the film, all we're really seeing is a rehash of the first APES movie, which feels obligatory to set up the scenario. Where this chapter starts to develop its own identity and really take off is in its second half, as Brent and Nova escape and find themselves going underground (literally) in the Forbidden Zone and discovering the ruins of a ravaged city, along with a community of radiation-scarred mutations who have mastered mental telepathy and worship an atomic bomb as their god who has created them. And they know it won't be long before the Ape Army will invade their sanctuary.Charlton Heston felt that sequels were not very challenging for an actor in those days, so at first he resisted appearing in this movie.

For, unlike the lessor men who make up most of Wayne's critics, Wayne was fair. This is clear even in The Alamo, in his depiction of Santana's army. Wayne believed in the basic nobility of men, much like those heroes depicted in Rio Bravo. That his life and memory is treated more like that of Marshal Sam Kane's in the Wayne-despised High Noon, or even in Wayne's own The Shootist is testimony that Wayne HOPED men were better than they are.I'd never seen the full-length version of The Alamo until it was released on VHS in the early 90s. I realized then the greatest scene in the movie is The Birthday Party, which was cut from the general release version of the film. NOTE For those that don't remember, during the 50s and 60s, Hollywood would release long, big budget movies as reserved seat attractions. The film would show at a roadshow theater for several months before general release. Since roadshow theaters showed the movies only twice a day, running time was restricted pretty much to the patience of audiences. However, when the same film was shown general release, time restrictions became important, so films were cut to maximize theater owner profits. It still happens today, except now the director's cut reaches the home audience via DVD. In any event, the short version of The Alamo, while impressive, is still a pale shadow of the Wayne's original cut. Most importantly, to see The Alamo is to understand John Wayne as a man, not an idol or actor. Wayne generously gave virtually all the big scenes to his costars. Certainly, Lawrence Harvey, Richard Widmark, Ken Curtis, Joan O'Brian and Richard Boone get better scenes. Also certainly, Chill Wills, Jester Hairston (Jethro) Hank Worden (Parson) and Veda Ann Borg (Blind Nell Robertson) have showier ones than Wayne. The scenes between Wayne and Linda Crystal in the first hour seem out of a different movie, though neither Wayne's nor Cristals are as big or showy as the ones I've mentioned. One thing I hope to suffer again was the reunion video attached to the VHS. The same old garbage about Wayne not being able to direct actors (by his SON, no less), that he really wasn't a very good director (Wayne's action scenes will match or beat anybody's in Hollywood). Especially rude was Richard Widmark's idea of impressing Wayne by insisting Wayne call him Richard and not Dick during their first meeting. Widmark came across as a pompous ass. However, the rudest cut was from Ken Festis Curtis. Curtis never had a better, more respectful part in ANY movie, but he didn't miss an opportunity to try to soil Wayne's memory.Forget that The Alamo is a topnotch, if not entirely historically accurate historical western. Forget that Wayne directs action better than his mentor, John Ford, or that Chill Wills got an Oscar nomination, the only of his career, thanks to this lousy director\/actor. Remember this, Wayne risked EVERYTHING on The Alamo and lost. He was broke for years afterward. Wayne's continued success on the A list was by no means assured. He was 54 years old and raising a second family. Wayne had recently been swindled by a business manager and recently lost a best friend to suicide (Grant Withers). Wayne had to take a role in The Alamo to secure financing, and The Alamo is probably STILL the biggest movie ever directed by one of its stars. During filming, Wayne had to contend with interference from mentor John Ford and a murder investigation of one of his actresses. That same year Wayne's house was severely damaged by fire. Yet Wayne took continued carping by lessor men, those artists in Hollywood who ridiculed his acting and his directing. I'm sure they sneered in satisfaction when The Alamo failed to break even. However, it's reported the movie eventually made a small profit, probably part of it through sale of Alamo Village in Bracketville, Texas.Wayne continued to make fine movies for sixteen more years after The Alamo. In 1969 he was finally awarded by his peers an Oscar for Rooster Cogburn. However, by then, Wayne had P.O.d them again with The Green Berets. War service or not, NOBODY can say the man ever ran from a fight. I'm not sure I would have liked John Wayne had I known him. I'm not a drinker and I'm not obsessively patriotic about this country, particularly since we started picking fights in the Middle East. However, as Wayne proved with Lawrence Harvey and Rock Hudson, Wayne didn't have to agree with someone's lifestyle or even their personal views to treat them with respect. I most certainly would respect him better than the friends he gave jobs in The Alamo; at least, those who slandered him.Oh, and by the way, RICHARD Widmark never won an Oscar.I give The Alamo a solid 8.

Much of it forms one of the cornerstones of film history, and it has one of the most famous scenes ever. But many people disregard it as a great movie. Even now I am utterly insulted that it is not even in IMDb's top 250. That's just an outrage. Rocky is a true classic in its field.It is also one of the most influential movies ever, perhaps not in cinematic techniques but in story techniques. Rocky is nothing else but the original underdog story. Nowadays it seems like every sports movie- no, it's really like this- employs an unthinkable underdog story. Every single one of those films takes their main focus off of Rocky.This movie never gets complicated, never enters thought, doesn't have any big plot twists or jaw-droppers, much less any philosophy or thought-provoking considerations, but it stabs at what you feel most your heart. It is simply impossible for any good person to feel nothing in their first viewing. You root for Rocky like you have never rooted for anyone else before. That is the essence of this movie.However, Rocky does have some splendid moments of direction. The steps scene, something that has been imitated so many times, something that is just as deep into our culture as the Vader battle in Empire Strikes Back, actually has some fantastic cinematography. The best part of Avildsen and Stallone's work are the intercutting shots of Rocky training coupled with the classic Rocky theme song.I have just hit at one of the major reasons for Rocky's emotional effect the soundtrack. Bar none, Rocky has the best and most inspirational soundtrack ever put forth into a movie. The theme song and the battle theme will flat out pump you up. It may sound silly to someone who hasn't watched Rocky, but it's the truth.The plot of Rocky is basically this he is just another bum living in the streets of Philadelphia and the first half of the movie do a great job of creating a depressing environment and a feeling of hopelessness. He is also a boxer at clubs, very clumsy, unskilled, but with a lot of heart. Then he gets the chance of a lifetime Apollo Creed, the world heavyweight champion, is looking for a local underdog to fight and he has chosen Rocky. From a million-to-one shot Rocky has a shot at the title. Little does he know that this is just a novelty. He trains hard with his trainer Mickey, who is one of the most lovable characters conceivable, and the movie eventually leads up to the climactic showdown with Creed.That fight pushes this movie over the top. It still stands as one of the greatest boxing scenes in the history of the cinema, maybe not as realistic or atmospheric as those found in Raging Bull but just as entertaining. And the fact that the ending isn't your typical jolly olly underdog tale. Although the most inspiring movie tale ever told this movie is not a very light one.In the end this stands as one of the greatest sports movies of all-time, in the Holy Trinity along with Raging Bull and Hoosiers. It is basically perfect in what it does and nothing more. Do not expect this movie to alter your life or your thinking, just get ready for an inspiring piece of film. 8.9.Did you get the license plate number? Of the truck that ran over your face.

The actor now assumes the challenging role of his own son, Caesar; or rather, the now-grown, angry but clever offspring of Zira and Cornelius, who survived his own assassination attempt at the climax of the previous movie.It's now the year 1991 (no, not the same '91 that we all experienced, but actually an altered version for the next time it comes 'round, having been changed by the arrival of Zira and Cornelius and their events of ESCAPE). The world has become different due to a mysterious virus brought back to Earth from the astronauts (maybe Zira & Cornelius themselves from their future?); as a result, dogs and cats have become extinct while apes increase in stature and rate of intelligence and ability to learn. To replace their lost pets, a business called APE MANAGEMENT (which I presume to be a franchise throughout the world) has been established to train gorillas, chimpanzees and orangutans to serve humans in their homes, as waiters, sweepers, bed-makers, and general servants.Ricardo Montalban is good as a kindly circus owner who brings Caesar into this new environment, but the young chimp must be careful not to reveal that he is actually the notorious talking ape who threatened humanity two decades earlier. Yet, as Caesar becomes increasingly angrier by the acts of bondage he witnesses among his fellow primates, he launches a full-scale riot to overthrow the community and bring humans to their knees. He is motivated by an all-consuming hatred and wages bloody war as the first step, possibly, to world domination on other continents. And that's just the point - some viewers say that the battle in CONQUEST is on such a relatively small scale that they can't see how the apes would, or could, take over the world. But if you pay close attention, the vengeful Caesar only considers this encounter a beginning, not an all-out apocalyptic defeat of all of mankind in one night! It's easy to gradually come down on this series as it goes along, pointing to the obvious lower budgets and so forth, but director J. Lee Thompson does a great job utilizing the futuristic look of the real-life Century City Complex to pull off a feeling of a city out of tomorrow.I won't deny that more money could have made this film even better (God knows the pull-over ape masks for the extras are certainly obvious), but I feel it's McDowall's energetic and intense performance that elevates this to a higher level than its budget alone would allow. Don Murray as the evil governor is perhaps a little too theatrical, but Severn Darden is quietly contemptible as his more reserved assistant, Kolp (who would return in the next and final chapter of the saga). Reportedly, preview audiences found the original ending too violent, so McDowall was called in to loop more humane lines of dialogue over some non-matching closeups for the movie's official release. It would be great to see a restored version with the actual ending one day**.

It features several gruesome, bloody, and violent moments which were cut out of the Theatrical Version. Also restored was the more downbeat ending.

Watching the film now, years after the arrival of that other spy master, James Bond, comparisons can be made between the two. Many of the elements that made this film a success and enjoyable to watch become staples in the later Bond movie series. A beautiful yet mysterious femme fatal, exciting chase sequences, masterful escapism, and ruthless villains. All are here and several years before the first Bond film, Dr. No was released in 1962.Of all that is said for how great this film is, and it is GREAT. I think that the suspenseful nature of the film is overlooked. I think that may be because it has much more humor than most Hitchcock films do. But this film is a real nail-biter, especially the famous finale that takes place on top of Mt. Rushmore! But all throughout the film is very suspenseful and full of Bond-like escapist action. Grant plays Roger Thornhill, a New York advertising agent, who is mistaken for super spy George Kaplan. He is suddenly thrust into the world of danger and espionage. After Thornhill successfully survives an assassination attempt(a rather ludicrous way to murder someone, but this is the movies, suspend disbelief.) he then attempts to find out who his attempted killers are and who it was they mistook him for. Along the way he meets a beautiful agent Eva Kendall, played convincingly by Eva Marie Saint. She tries to help Thornhill, but he is not sure which side she is on. Thornhill finds out that Kaplan, the man he was mistaken for is actually a decoy created by western intelligence in order to confuse and shift suspicion away from their real agent Kendall, who is working under the nose of the eastern agents. Thornhill does something that could potential out Kendall to the eastern agents, and then he feels obligated to save Kendall. It is actually a healthy mix of love and obligation and perhaps a desire for a little excitement that leads Thornhill to assume the fictitious role of Kaplan and help rescue Kendall and assist the western agents in capturing the eastern agents.With the great locations, chase scenes, and great story, North by Northwest is another triumph for Hitchcock, and an all around entertaining film.

Decisions and plot lines are not even a little plausible but there is a great chemistry between John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale that really makes up for that. So let's not talk about the story, which in a way is always predictable with romantic comedies. I mean, the two stars will end up together, right? Besides the chemistry there are funny moments too, most of them with John Cusack. I always like him and especially in films where he has to look sad and disappointed for quite some time he is terrific.

experience.The very mis-leading assumption someone can make about a time ago is to suggest that it is dated in the purport of its message.We can learn something about why if movies provide any value it is probably best at allowing the public to know just what kind of a guy that drunken barber really is.This is to suggest that this is a film that provides a political underpinning that is designed to perhaps entertain but as well to make aware what kind of a world we live in.The idea of some fifth column activity is chock full of propaganda and as well the placing of that abuse in the hands of a media conglomerate is very real now isn't it.Here we have a veiled attempt to over-ride a democratically elected public domain issue with the heavy hand of a power not derived through due process but by the coercive as well as deceitful abilities had by vested power brokers in both the press and unions of the 1940s.How dangerous is this challenge?The trouble with this as well as other satirical presentations is that where this is just a movie,what was occurring in the world at that point in time could not be ignored.It is also worth noting that though the reader may believe naively something or other, more times than not these films represent a desire for importance that is often why there are films that have such a underpinning as to suggest that we are not so stable a practice now are we?The token gesture here is had when John Doe gets pelted with tomatoes and garbage and is carried from the stage as if there was represented in the event the Crucifixion of Christ.I mention this because I had the pleasure of watching a documentary in which film Directors like Raoul Walsh,Vincent Manelli,Frank Capra were all talked of in light of there work as directors.There is very much in that scene exactly that an attempt to portray John Doe as a scapegoat for the shameful purpose had by these blow hard characters which by the way are lead by Ann Mitchell,played by Barbara Stanwyck.There is certainly the allure of power that is present but it isn't simply the allure that is difficult it is the inability that it ultimately provides for to such an extent that there is the concept of the little fish being devoured by bigger fish and the bigger fish being devoured by even bigger fish until it is believed that one will ultimately devour all of reality and conquer the world,such is the conceit of this politically motivated satire.That does not happen in this film because they chose to end it that way and that is John Doe with some help from Ann Mitchell comes in from the cold.However,it would be more interesting to here Frank Capra talk about this film because there are many instances where there are unmistakable references to Nazi as well Fascist undertones and the juxtaposition of Hitlers rise to power and the attempt being subverted by this media conglomerate.Though it is not outwardly as dangerous,it is perhaps very naive because it did happen now didn't it.When I refer to references I mean that DB Nortons nephew is involved in a motor cycle corp of a quasi police state and it is DB Norton who ultimately wishes to be the biggest one of them all,veiled as it is.It is DB Norton played by Edward Arnold who owns the newspapers and the radio stations and so on.The time in history is worth noting that though there was in the European community a grave danger through the rise of Nazism and Fascism,there was equally as unsettling here as we were still in the midst of a recovery out of the Dust Bowl years and the Great Depression.The underpinning of the John Doe club provided a Christian precept to our understanding of our neighbor that is to love your neighbor as thyself and indeed there is both of that in the poverty of the John Doe club members and as well the encouragement to love your neighbor as thyself which made for the political undertow that these worthy attributes exemplified.However as is stated in the picture just prior to the convention Connell,newspaper editor employed by DB Norton played by James Gleason says to DB Norton Im a sucker if I can put two and two together but where do you come inthis was in reference to the fact that it was DB Nortons Money and influence that created the John Doe clubs and now he was going to try and make them into a political party.There some excellent scenes which you will not forget and there are excellent all around performances from Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck and on in this portrayal of a time ago.Is this all there is,it would be better to not know anything than to know so much as to have established a prejudice before even having seen this film.I enjoyed this film very much when I initially viewed it on channel 13 in the year 1971.It was seen very near the same time that the aforementioned documentary was and was an intelligent look see at the problems and abuses of this world that we live in.It seemed not to be so long ago and even with a glance as to the very time and place of this review.It is not entirely unfamiliar and all the more remarkable in light of the fact that this film was made in 1941.What does that say or mean,Thats up
