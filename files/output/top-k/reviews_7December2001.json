This movie had never appealed to me, but I got free tickets to a sneak preview of it, and since I had nothing to do on the night of preview, I decided to go to it. How I wish I hadn't. One of the main problems with the film is the type of animation they decided to use. It reminded me of animation that's in several computer games, especially SimTheme Park. Sure, it would have suited a half-an-hour cartoon show, but not a full length movie! The characters are dull and unfunny. Jimmy Neutron, the title character, is cute at first, but then becomes annoying. Very annoying. The story itself is unoriginal and, well, lame. A boy genius who gets himself into many little adventures. Half the shows on The Cartoon Network are already about that! Young children may find it entertaining, but it's going to be an absolute pain for their parents to sit through. I wanted to walk out of the theater in the first 20 minutes of the film, but since my 5-year-old niece (who I took to the screening with me) seemed to be enjoying herself, I decided not to. But it turns out that she didn't enjoy it that much at all! When I asked her how she liked it she responded It was OK. In a year of many great animated films (such as Shrek, Atlantis, and Monsters, Inc.), this one is at the bottom of the cartoon barrel.
