However, thanks to a perceptive screenplay by William Broyles, Jr., this film practically made me disappointed with myself for making those assumptions. Even worse, it wasn't until I saw Hanks on the THE TONIGHT SHOW a few months later and explaining that his inspiration for CAST AWAY came when he viewed a documentary on the life and disappearance of Amelia Earhart, as well as the startling theory that she may have lived another 50 years on a deserted island after being discovered missing.  On that note, there will most likely not be another time I will misjudge Hollywood for what I hear before I actually buy my ticket and popcorn and watch the movie and not putting my opinions down on paper before I actually watch the final frame. Director Robert Zemeckis (who helmed the much-loved favorites BACK TO THE FUTURE, CONTACT and WHAT LIES BENEATH) teams with Hanks for the very first time to tell the story of a FEDEX employee who finds himself washed ashore on a Pacific island after a frightening plane crash.  It's now Man vs. Nature as Hanks collects small amounts of water from coconuts and rain, builds a fire to cook crab, make attempts let people know he is there and be rescued, and even creating a companion to talk to---a Wilson volleyball!  I will not divulge what happens to Hanks eventually, for the purpose that this film develops an emotional intensity during the final half four.Just as it sounds this is Tom Hanks' show all the way; the two-time Academy Award winner has been giving outstanding trademark performances all throughout his career, from playing a 12-year-old trapped inside the body of a 30-year-old (BIG), to a homosexual battling AIDS (PHILADELPHIA), and finally to a sweet simpleton who only is only barely aware of his surroundings and the people in this life (FORREST GUMP).  In CAST AWAY, Hanks makes his character someone to actually care about, which is one of the most important elements in any good performance;  he makes his lost FEDEX worker convincingly go through different emotional phases which results in a strong development in the character.  Academy-Award winner Helen Hunt (AS GOOD AS IT GETS) plays the woman he loves with earnestness and compassion.  Still, the one character that practically steals the film is Wilson, the volleyball who Hanks creates as a friend in order escape insanity, and as a lesser reason to have something---if not someone---to talk to; Wilson's final sequence is truly moving and unforgettable. In more ways than one, CAST AWAY surprised me and I loved it from beginning to end; if anything, I truly believe that with any other actor besides Hanks the character would be dull and the viewer wouldn't get involved.  The film also boasts a fine score by Alan Silvestri (a regular on many Zemeckis films), as well as gorgeous photography and, finally, William Broyles, Jr's wonderful script, which managed to dodge cliches and make the film overall seem new and fresh.    For that reason, I know that next time I go see a film a famliar story, that I will not print a word until the theater's lights illuminate once again.

Kevin Smith is a very talented writer\/director who has a knack for offbeat plots and refreshingly original dialogue.  He displays his talent greatly in this offbeat comedy.  One impressive element of Chasing Amy is it contains very little of the standard, soapy, Hollywood-ish romance.  It's very unpredictable, and doesn't contain the ending many would probably suspect.  Of course, we know that Joey Lauren is going to end up in bed with Ben, but there wouldn't be any intrigue or conflict if that didn't happen.  It's what happens afterwards that counts.  The only cliche I spotted was the scene where Ben reveals his love for Joey.  It takes place on a rainy night.  And Joey gets outraged and runs out of the car--IN THE RAIN!!  Hello?  Pneumonia?  You ever thought of that?  I think if it was real life, she would've waited for Ben to drive her back--THEN shout out her feelings and leave.  Other than that, the film approaches the romance genre and lesbianism with sheer originality and (sometimes brutal) honesty.  In the scene where Jason Lee catches Ben in bed with Joey, all we see is his mouth opened wide and his coffee cup dropping to the floor.  None of that melodramatic, confrontational crap we usually see when a character is surprised to catch their friend in bed with someone they don't expect.  Though I often appraise Smith's witty dialogue, his love for dialogue is also a minor flaw.  In some scenes, the characters use so many adjectives and metaphors that it just sounds more written than acted out.  It just doesn't have that flow.  And it's a little unconvincing to have a character use the term f**king c**ksucker over and over again in one scene, and delivering an intelligent monologue full of college-level SAT words in the next.Despite its minor flaws, Chasing Amy is a film like no other.  One that honestly stands alone.  We've seen other films about lesbianism, but this is one to use the subject in a mature (though profane) and non-preachy manner. It doesn't take advantage of any of the stereotypes.  And I like the surprise at the end where the character, who you least expect, delivers a thoughtful monologue that is the defining moment of the movie.

One impressive element of Chasing Amy is it contains very little of the standard, soapy, Hollywood-ish romance.  It's very unpredictable, and doesn't contain the ending many would probably suspect.  Of course, we know that Joey Lauren is going to end up in bed with Ben, but there wouldn't be any intrigue or conflict if that didn't happen.  It's what happens afterwards that counts.  The only cliche I spotted was the scene where Ben reveals his love for Joey.  It takes place on a rainy night.  And Joey gets outraged and runs out of the car--IN THE RAIN!!  Hello?  Pneumonia?  You ever thought of that?  I think if it was real life, she would've waited for Ben to drive her back--THEN shout out her feelings and leave.  Other than that, the film approaches the romance genre and lesbianism with sheer originality and (sometimes brutal) honesty.  In the scene where Jason Lee catches Ben in bed with Joey, all we see is his mouth opened wide and his coffee cup dropping to the floor.  None of that melodramatic, confrontational crap we usually see when a character is surprised to catch their friend in bed with someone they don't expect.  Though I often appraise Smith's witty dialogue, his love for dialogue is also a minor flaw.  In some scenes, the characters use so many adjectives and metaphors that it just sounds more written than acted out.  It just doesn't have that flow.  And it's a little unconvincing to have a character use the term f**king c**ksucker over and over again in one scene, and delivering an intelligent monologue full of college-level SAT words in the next.Despite its minor flaws, Chasing Amy is a film like no other.  One that honestly stands alone.  We've seen other films about lesbianism, but this is one to use the subject in a mature (though profane) and non-preachy manner. It doesn't take advantage of any of the stereotypes.  And I like the surprise at the end where the character, who you least expect, delivers a thoughtful monologue that is the defining moment of the movie.

However, if you look past the movie stereotypes for love stories,(i.e. boy meets girl, girl likes boy, boy likes girl, girl and boy live happily ever after) you are in for a real cinematic treat.The film focuses on two men and their failures with love, officer 223 (He Zhiwu), and officer 663 (Tony Leung Chiu Wai). Officer 223 has recently been dumped by his lover and while at first taking it as a joke, soon realizes that his May will not be returning. Dejected, officer 223 attempts to find redemption by swooning another woman. His attempts are comical as you see him call through his entire list of possible dates, only to hear more humorous lines of rejection. However, a call on his birthday from a special lady friend gives hope to officer 223 and renews his faith in the expiration of true love. Officer 663's luck is no better as he also is dumped, but he rebounds as well in his own unique way with a California star-struck voyeur. While these two love stories may seem unrelated and confusing, a second view sheds new light and restores the sanity lost in the first viewing.The camera techniques used in `Chungking Express' distort time and motion, giving the viewer the notion that at certain times the characters move at a different tempo from the rest of the world.

This is probably the biggest flaw of the second movie. A character appears seemingly out of nowhere for a fight scene and although MK fans know who they are, the general audience has no clue. Most of the characters that appear like this are either killed off in the single fight scene or disappear and are never heard from again. In a couple of instances, the names of the characters weren't even mentioned. It was a bad attempt to try and squeeze every single character from the video game into the movie. (And it's still missing some character - Kintaro and Kung Lao come to mind.)Another huge problem with the movie is that a sequel should not require that you have watched the original in order to enjoy it and understand everything that's going on. This movie picks up the second that the original one left off and spends only about 30 seconds explaining what happened the the first movie, but someone who hasn't seen the original has no way of identifying with the characters at all, who are never really introduced because the very first scene starts with Shao kahn invading the earth.Probably the next biggest fault of the movie is that it's missing Christopher Lambert as Rayden. Though the new guy that played Rayden tried hard, it just wasn't a good casting decision. And the other actors were pretty bad as well. The original MK certainly didn't win any awards for its acting, but the acting in this one is just plain bad for the most part.Another problem with the movie is continuity and other such issues. A good deal of the movie revolves around Liu Kang searching through the desert trying to find a character named Nightwolf in order to 'find his animality', which is supposed to prepare him for a final battle with Shao Kahn. However, all of this was totally unnecessary, since learning his animality had no impact whatsoever on the outcome of the final fight scene. Also, we have Shao Kahn's father who is trying to destroy the earth .. we are told nothing about him, except that he is an elder god. Heck, we don't even learn his name. He says that breaking the 'sacred rules' of the elder gods to invade the earth could have dire consequences if they ever found out, but we learn later in the movie that they already know about it in the first place. WTF?People say there's no plot in this movie, but I disagree. It's about an evil emperor of a place called 'Outworld' who tries to merge his world with ours, therefore destroying the earth in 6 days. A group of humans have to keep this from happeneing. Even though this movie is bad, I think saying it has no plot is a little unfair. (If you really want to see a movie that has no plot, watch Forrest Gump.)

This movie picks up the second that the original one left off and spends only about 30 seconds explaining what happened the the first movie, but someone who hasn't seen the original has no way of identifying with the characters at all, who are never really introduced because the very first scene starts with Shao kahn invading the earth.Probably the next biggest fault of the movie is that it's missing Christopher Lambert as Rayden. Though the new guy that played Rayden tried hard, it just wasn't a good casting decision. And the other actors were pretty bad as well. The original MK certainly didn't win any awards for its acting, but the acting in this one is just plain bad for the most part.Another problem with the movie is continuity and other such issues. A good deal of the movie revolves around Liu Kang searching through the desert trying to find a character named Nightwolf in order to 'find his animality', which is supposed to prepare him for a final battle with Shao Kahn. However, all of this was totally unnecessary, since learning his animality had no impact whatsoever on the outcome of the final fight scene. Also, we have Shao Kahn's father who is trying to destroy the earth .. we are told nothing about him, except that he is an elder god. Heck, we don't even learn his name. He says that breaking the 'sacred rules' of the elder gods to invade the earth could have dire consequences if they ever found out, but we learn later in the movie that they already know about it in the first place. WTF?People say there's no plot in this movie, but I disagree. It's about an evil emperor of a place called 'Outworld' who tries to merge his world with ours, therefore destroying the earth in 6 days. A group of humans have to keep this from happeneing. Even though this movie is bad, I think saying it has no plot is a little unfair.

Whether you will like, or dislike this film is dependent on whether you feel the need for tidy endings, or appreciate a step away from the norm.  This tale of the love lives of two Hong Kong lawmen - Cop 223 played by He Zhiwu, and Cop 663 played by Tony Leung Chiu Wai - may leave you utterly confused after your first viewing, but is worth a second look.  While I was disappointed in the film the first time I saw it, a repeat viewing cleared up much of this confusion.  The film explores two seemingly separate tales of romance in the lives of 223 and 663.  We are introduced to these men at a time when they are each forced to deal with the end of their relationships with their respective girlfriends.  The film contains some humorous moments as each man has a unique way of dealing with their loss. The images and actions in the film tell the story well enough that the subtitles are seemingly unnecessary.  Wong's choice to use a handheld camera had a way of pulling me into the action, making each of the scenes in which it was used all the more intense.  This intensity was enough to keep me enthralled in a film that at times was difficult to understand.  While the characters make many things clear, for me the one that was not was the direction the plot was taking.  `Chungking Express' moves along at a rapid pace in its early stages, which both draws us in and makes it easy to lose track of the many connections between characters that are not emphasized - but are shown to us nonetheless.  In the latter part of the film things slow down, but not at the risk of losing the viewer's attention.  This is the positive side of the hard-to-follow plot - it intrigues one to the point that it is impossible to take your eyes off of the screen.  While it is a difficult movie to follow - and subtitles can be bothersome - `Chungking Express' is a film that is worth viewing.

The plot is much easier to piece together a second time through, which will allow you to fully appreciate this film.GO BIG RED!!!!!!!  ","genre":null},{"date":"12 April 2001","score":"","review":"  Kar-wai Wong's film `Chungking Express' is sure to leave you feeling differently than most films you have seen.  Whether you will like, or dislike this film is dependent on whether you feel the need for tidy endings, or appreciate a step away from the norm.  This tale of the love lives of two Hong Kong lawmen - Cop 223 played by He Zhiwu, and Cop 663 played by Tony Leung Chiu Wai - may leave you utterly confused after your first viewing, but is worth a second look.  While I was disappointed in the film the first time I saw it, a repeat viewing cleared up much of this confusion.  The film explores two seemingly separate tales of romance in the lives of 223 and 663.  We are introduced to these men at a time when they are each forced to deal with the end of their relationships with their respective girlfriends.  The film contains some humorous moments as each man has a unique way of dealing with their loss. The images and actions in the film tell the story well enough that the subtitles are seemingly unnecessary.  Wong's choice to use a handheld camera had a way of pulling me into the action, making each of the scenes in which it was used all the more intense.  This intensity was enough to keep me enthralled in a film that at times was difficult to understand.  While the characters make many things clear, for me the one that was not was the direction the plot was taking.  `Chungking Express' moves along at a rapid pace in its early stages, which both draws us in and makes it easy to lose track of the many connections between characters that are not emphasized - but are shown to us nonetheless.  In the latter part of the film things slow down, but not at the risk of losing the viewer's attention.  This is the positive side of the hard-to-follow plot - it intrigues one to the point that it is impossible to take your eyes off of the screen.  While it is a difficult movie to follow - and subtitles can be bothersome - `Chungking Express' is a film that is worth viewing.

That's like going to see a heavy metal band and saying the band was loud.  The camera work is very non-traditional, but only someone with no artistic vision could term it bad.  Clearly the film was a big hit because of its completely non-traditional approach- and that approach works well.  The cinematography and shot composition work VERY WELL, even if we're seeing half the actor's face or just their shoes or just twigs on the ground.  Watching the film, you recognize why the directors would use those kinds of shots instead of some agent making sure the actress has her grand entrance.  It shows that the big hollywood special affects and computer animation crowd has nothing over good-old-fashion low-budget storytelling.there's a reason why people flocked to the original Night of the Living Dead over other late 60s horror movies.I saw Blair witch for the first time on video a few weeks ago and I can't get it out of my head.Rent it with an open mind that you are watching a film that was made in the style of a home video.  I found it engrossing- I thought the improv lines and writing were terrific, completely natural.  The film sneaks up on you and it reminds me of any strenuous and un-ending task (like writing a class project that takes you so long that you're pulling all-nighters and basically freaking out trying to finish that paper for an important class).  you know that feeling of being on-the-edge?  The cast experiences that in spades.The only really frightening movie that I have seen in the last 5 years, bar none.  no hollywood horror movie of the last 5 years has anything on Blair Witch.
