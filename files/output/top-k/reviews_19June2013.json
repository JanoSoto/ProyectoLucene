Taking his inspiration from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960), John Carpenter creates a work that is quite honestly, one the most unsettling horror pictures any horror fan should see. And for the budget that it was made on, should amaze viewers even more. This is one of those rare gems that are hard to come by. There is one thing to pick on but it's not the most relevant of things.The story starts out about a small boy who is convicted of murder in 1963. Skip 15 years later, he breaks out of the asylum and returns to his hometown on Halloween night to seek more victims. Coming straight into this madman's path is a high school girl who has no rhyme or reason to meet him. It just so happens that fate was behind it. Playing the high school girl, Laurie Strode is now famous actress, Jaime Lee Curtis. Boy does Curtis have some hair in this movie. I'm so used to her having short hair.But besides that, Curtis does a great job displaying her fear on screen. I think many can agree that anyone would react in the same way if they ran into this killer. Along with her is veteran actor Donald Pleasence who plays the killer's doctor, Dr. Loomis. Pleasence also puts in a good performance because he portrays how serious the situation is. And although he is not credited as Michael Myers and is instead called The Shape, Nick Castle as the killer is also great at his role. A towering 6-foot giant is not a happy sight if he's carrying a kitchen knife with him and is wearing a white expressionless mask.However, one of the more surprising things about this movie is that for gore, it's rather tame. There's only a body count of 5, total, and even the killing scenes are not that gruesome. That's nothing to knock at though. The way John Carpenter really makes this character effective is by making the killer elusive and creepy. When the killer is on screen, he doesn't talk and just stands around like a scarecrow, watching menacingly. Even creepier is how a character will see him one minute and the next he's gone. It's almost like he wasn't there to begin with. That's what's difficult to stomach. Imagine if there was someone like that in your neighborhood? Yeeesh.However here's where I have to knock the film though. I wanted a little back-story about this killer. Why did he kill at such a young age? Was it intended? Was it out of curiosity? Or is there really a demon inhabiting the boy's body? Why? And the audience will never have it answered. I wish that at least was explained. But that's it. Finally what topped off this work was John Carpenter's self composed score. There may have not been too many diverse tracks, but he did have a main theme for the franchise and the characters themselves, which made every scene memorable. In most tracks, a piano will play at either a quick or slow pace. But either way, it will get the chills going.Thanks to John Carpenter's ingenuity, October 31rst will never quite feel the same again. The actors put in great performances, the music is tantalizingly cringe worthy and the killer himself is not to be reckoned with.

Very cheesy and in-your-face music.. Something that greatly lowers the quality for me is the fairly weak calibre of the first two stories. I've always felt that there should have been at least one more. The other main problem is the unbearably corny and irritating animated wraparound story. The hideously poor animation feels completely out of place and just plain deters from the fun and brings the whole concept down. Things generally come off as being on the cheap side compared to before. Like it's Creepshow lite. I got the strong impression that there weren't nearly as many resources available. The first story comes off more as a melancholy drama with tinges of horror. It's a bit of a depressing lacklustre start with the dusty dead town, and the prolonged demise of the kindly old couple is unpleasant, but I suppose the slow build-up and seeing what they're going through does serve the purpose of making you feel worse when they're done in, and in turn enjoy it all the more when justice is served. Frank Salsedo gives a sweet old performance as Chief Whitemoon. I liked his use of the Native American dialect. It gave me such a chill as a kid, the barely perceptible nod Chief Woodenhead gives him as he leaves the store. And his reaction is interesting, like he may have his suspicions about the statue's secret. I love the poignant end scene with him, but is it the right kind of ending for what's supposed to be a terror tale? People complain there's not enough action from the Chief, but he's supposed to be made of ancient wood! How much could he be moving without spoiling the illusion? Holt Mccallany as the psycho narcissist was great and is the most memorable thing about the story. Nice bit of poetic horror irony how he pays for his evil deed with the hair that was his crowning glory. They skimped on his death scene - if anybody's end deserved to be relished it was that guy's!  The second tale is good because you can imagine the horror of the predicament of the icy lake-hell in which the hapless young souls are entrapped. You get the idea that the thing can wait forever if it has to. I like the monster, reminds me of The Blob, which I love. (eighties one only!) Yeah it looks a little crummy, but then again it doesn't exactly look like anything, just good old-fashioned mysterious killer sea-squirm... To me Stephen King's short story isn't his best, although he's generally a genius when it comes to that. Anyone reading it hoping to learn more will likely be disappointed. A novella called Slime, by Joseph Payne Brennan is much better. The most gruesomely effective scene is when Randy's feeling up the sleeping Laverne and it gives the impression that she's moaning in pleasure, but it's soon revealed that it's because the sneaky ooze is eating into her face as the gentle scene switches to full-blown horror and things get really nasty as she tries to get it off, but only smears it around like some kind of nightmare mascara! It goes to show that no matter the situation libido will always win out over all reason and fear! The ending is such a bummer... Poor dumb-ass Randy would have gotten away if he hadn't stopped to rub it in! I don't need to know exactly what it is. The No Swimming sign pretty much sums it up. Was it contained, or placed there on purpose to guard something? It must have been there a very long time for all the plant life to cover the sign. I do love that sign, it's very E.C. Too late...  To me they saved the best till last in what I think is at the end of the day a fun but rather lame sequel to the masterful original. It's a classic, with great suspense all the way through. The open road is such a prime setting for all kinds of horror. The idea of being alone in the dead of night on an unknown deserted highway is already pretty surreal and eerie without the supernatural thrown in. Lois Chiles is brilliant as a cheater\/hit-and-run perpetrator who eventually gets her comeuppance. She stars out looking fairly attractive, but ends up a bit of a monster herself as she gets all banged up. I love her cool classy voice when she's trying to rationalise everything to herself. I also dig the rocking music that sounds like it came straight out of some old 70s exploitation movie! Tom Wright's performance and progressively gross makeup effects are fantastic. No matter how mangled he becomes, he keeps coming back. He's both funny and frightening. Not a solemn kind of ghost with any special powers, more just a terminally f****d-up guy who slowly grinds her down with his relentless pursuit. And the car is no protection or escape at all, he is everywhere... A damn chilling moments to me is when she spots him comically hobbling towards her in the rear-view mirror - still creeps me out to this day! It has its problems, but it's a faithful enough sequel that entertains. Give it a go and have yourself some creeptacular twisted fun!

Whole other, milder, happier lives seem implicit in these characters' sad glances and careful movements, and Gregory Peck and Anthony Quayle in particular convey with great subtlety that their characters would rather be comfortably behind desks&#x97;not to preserve their own safety, which they put unhesitatingly at risk, but to prevent them from having to make difficult decisions about the lives of other members of their top-secret team. The casting of well-known, likable actors such as David Niven, Gregory Peck, and Anthony Quinn is essential for the impact of the story's cloak-and-dagger twists, in which agonizing personal decisions and private anxieties are brought to the fore. The Nazis are of course fearful villains, especially in a tense interrogation scene, and their heavy gun emplacement targeted for sabotage makes for a great set piece backdrop, but in a departure from other war films of the period these elements are almost a sideshow here. At the heart of the film instead are the dynamics within the Allied infiltration team itself, and the team's efforts to navigate, in good faith, the situations that require them to regard as expendable anyone who threatens the success of the mission&#x97;including injured or untrustworthy members of their own team. These personalized stakes make Navarone among the most tense and uncompromising war movies I've seen.

The Nazis are of course fearful villains, especially in a tense interrogation scene, and their heavy gun emplacement targeted for sabotage makes for a great set piece backdrop, but in a departure from other war films of the period these elements are almost a sideshow here. At the heart of the film instead are the dynamics within the Allied infiltration team itself, and the team's efforts to navigate, in good faith, the situations that require them to regard as expendable anyone who threatens the success of the mission&#x97;including injured or untrustworthy members of their own team. These personalized stakes make Navarone among the most tense and uncompromising war movies I've seen.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"19 June 2013","score":"","review":" One can not help but be overwhelmed by the power, the stunning brilliance, and incredibly amazing performance by Ms. Emily Watson that assuredly deserved an Academy Award and which shames the Oscars forever because a Paltrow, Berry, or other flunky has received a statue and Watson has been brutally robbed. This is acting at its absolute finest and a role so perfectly realized by Watson that it can never be forgotten by anyone who has seen it. Never in the history of cinema has any actress so completely captured the very soul of a character and transferred it so expertly to film. It is indeed a film for the ages because of what Watson brings to it, the fire and passion she ignites the screen with, and the unbridled superbness of craft she puts forth. One is almost blinded by such brilliance and I was not the only member of the audience to stagger from the theatre upon first viewing of this film, breathless with astonishment and trembling with emotion as I tried to find words to express the depth of my feelings to my evening's companion. I could barely speak the word Emily and could see from my companion's eyes she was equally affected by what she had just witnessed and we shared the awe in silence as the dazed audience around us wandered as if numbed into the night. Rarely has a performance touched me in this way and yet with Emily Watson it is par for the course due to an unequaled talent that few if any other actor can begin to approach. I felt pummeled by her work, bruised by her electric might, and singed by her passion. That night was one I will never forget. I have never seen an audience literally struck dumb by a performance in a cinema. Since seeing this film I have found Watson routinely splendid and spectacularly superb in role after role. There is no doubt she is the single greatest living actor working in the English language today and this film serves as a perfect showcase for her magnificent genius.
