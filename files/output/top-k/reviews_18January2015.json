Bean is the first movie made about the character, which I have seen countless times and never gets old. While this one was awesome, Rowan Atkinson made a sequel to this in 2007 where he tried to make it more like the show. That was a disaster. This was a success.Bean received a lot of flack for not transitioning well to the big screen because of actual dialogue spoken throughout. I will agree that the show was better, but this movie isn't far behind it! While there is dialogue, Mr. Bean stays silent and mumbling. The movie is about him living with a family in LA so of course people will talk! But since Mr. Bean himself stays the same, there's really nothing to worry about. What made the show so timeless was there was virtually no talking by anybody. This is a movie, so of course there would be changes. Mostly to differentiate from the show.Bean shows what he does for a living, which is not explained in the show. He works at an art museum as a caretaker who mostly sleeps on the job. That's just like him to do. They show him sleeping, which mirrors the church episode he falls asleep in. Bean features some of the same gags taken from the show. The rest of the staff wants him gone, for he is the worst employee the gallery has ever had, but is defended by the chairman of the board. Instead, they send him to America to unveil and give lectures on Whistler's Mother, recently bought by an art museum in Los Angeles. His host, David Langley (MacNicol), thinks he is a scholar and allows him to move in with his family for the time being. During his time there, Mr. Bean destroys everything in his path, including everything important in David's life. Can Mr. Bean fix his mistakes?All of the recycled gags found here are almost as funny as when they were first seen in the show. In the show, they were unexpected which made them more funny. All of the new gags make for this to be just as funny as the show. Another funny thing in this is we see what Mr. Bean's first name is Mister! In the sequel to this, it says his first name is Rowan. Either way, seeing his first name is awesome. Bean has a better look to it than the show. It takes place in LA, which is a beautiful and more glowing city. Plus there's the acting by Atkinson and the rest of the cast is great. Peter MacNicol is a very underrated and talented actor who shines as brightly as David. Mr. Bean's rampage takes a major toll on him in very funny ways. Their friendship and the chemistry between them is a joy to see, as it helps understand why hasn't gotten fired from his work in England. When Mr. Bean gives his speech during the unveiling, he add-libs the whole thing for about two minutes without stopping the longest he has ever spoken. It is short, sweet, and touching. While he hasn't got a clue about the painting, he does his own interpretation which comes out as a wonderful monologue that sears the heart.

Not just because it's a movie about a couple who gleefully mass-murders people, but because of the relentless style. The movie is such a zany and noisy audiovisual presentation that it can be exhausting and nerve-wracking.Presentation is a large part of what makes this film memorable; from start to finish, it is a rapid-fire onslaught of images upon images that collectively tells the story of murder and mayhem. The editing is often brilliant in the way it juxtaposes related images in an expressionistic manner. It can also be very weird, especially when animation, black-and-white photography, stock footage, overlays, and bizarre background effects are used in such short proximity. If you can stomach the craziness, the film does have plenty of memorable scenes, including a kick-butt opening sequence, and a finale filled with all-out rioting and bloodshed.The story is pretty simple, but the characters take the front stage. You might think it's hard to relate to these brutal, twisted people, but their romance, rebellion, and carefree attitudes make them the most charismatic pair of criminals since Bonnie and Clyde. Thanks to the way the film is shown, and the way it dispenses pop-culture images all over the place, the film delivers an underlying theme of violence, and the way it's constantly exploited in the mass media to be delivered to the whole world as a product. It might be seen as pretentious and hypocritical that it's a violent movie preaching against violent movies. However, I don't see this as glorifying violence, since there's nothing glorious about it. It's a trashy and ugly affair, full of ugly characters and ugly acts. In the end, the film serves as a bold and shocking descent into the pathology of the minds of mass murderers, and perhaps also an exploration of the people who idolize them.This film has some incredibly crazy photography; the camera tends to float around each scene, with a lot of skewed angles. Editing is very fast and relentless, with each scene intercut with a myriad of different images. Acting is intense; Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis inhabit their characters perfectly, while Robert Downey Jr and Tommy Lee Jones are extremely batty in their roles. Writing is good. Half of the sets, props, and costumes used are rather cheesy and fake-looking, but then the other half tends to look gritty and more real. Music is often pretty loud and obnoxious, but it matches up with the film well.The style and violence of this film is incredibly dense and zany, but it is a heck of an experience that provides a stark expression of unbridled psychosis.

Of course for Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), was not the only movie franchise in general to achieve mainstream popularity and have a sequel made right after it. Like many others, whether it be Part 2 or just labeled with the number 2 after it, its successor ended up financially blowing away its competition but lost its critical flare that the original had. The reason behind these flaws was either the lack of the creator's involvement with the further projects or the producers decided otherwise what should be the next step in the franchise. As of right now, there's only one horror sequel that manages to complete its narrative in two successful steps and that's John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) and Halloween II (1981).Here fans are introduced to Jesse Walsh (Mark Patton), the newest tenant living in 1428 Elm Street, the same house that Krueger appeared in 1984. After a few nights of some intense dreams involving Krueger (Robert Englund) wanting Jesse to kill for him, his friends Lisa Webber (Kim Myers) and Ron Grady (Robert Rusler) begin to notice and try to figure out what's going on. The sequel to A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) doesn't make sense in a number of areas. As his first writing job, David Chaskin didn't modify the script in any way to enhance the story that was told prior. His first mistake is the title; Freddy's Revenge? Who is Krueger getting revenge on? He got his revenge at the end of the first entry. This also completely puts into question what are Freddy's motivations. Why does Freddy want Jesse to kill for him? If its to avoid having people think Freddy Krueger is back, the reason seems pointless. Nobody believes what they don't see anyway. Jack Sholder's direction in the plot is interesting but if looked at deeper, it just doesn't add up. The only thing Chaskin does correctly is continuing to maintain connections to the first nightmare by introducing Nancy's diary, which gives the characters a sparknotes edition of the events before. Although even that may come into question because I don't clearly remember Nancy ever writing down anything about her experiences. The main actors do give believable performances for the situations they encounter but unfortunately, they aren't attachable. Mark Patton and his co-stars can portray emotion but they just aren't the same likable cast. The only actor who comes out unscathed is Robert Englund just because he's playing Krueger like he always has. The only difference here is that he no longer has a connection to these specific characters other than one of the individuals living in 1428 Elm Street.Even actor Marshall Bell has a minor role but for those who are familiar with Bell's other roles, they might already know where he's headed. The cinematography provided by Jacques Haitkin (who worked on the first nightmare) and Christopher Tufty manage to keep the look of the first with various lighting and colors. However, the creativity behind the dream sequences isn't as frequent anymore either. And when the scene shifts to a dream, the scenes focus more on the surroundings than what Krueger can do. Instead, the big thing going for when Krueger is around is that everything gets molten hot. That's nice because in some cases it did look good for the practical and special effects used. However more could have been done too. A good example of this is one dream sequence that is skin crawling. For a minute I actually thought it was real.This leads to the horror aspect of the picture. Is it scary? Well, for horror fans no but they should still have fun watching it. As for anyone else who's not used to Krueger already, they will be scared. The makeup on Krueger is still slimy and gross and his method of killing is still grotesque and ugly. Can you imagine being killed by rusty claws? Ewww,...at least clean them. The music produced by horror composer Christopher Young is an unfortunate let down too. Young who would later prove himself with Clive Barker's Hellraiser (1987) score, manages to only make the score to this sequel only creepy and not scare inducing. For some reason, Young also did not include composer Charles Bernstein's original theme from the first movie and its sad because Young probably could have enhanced such a unforgettable cue. Here Young does include drawn out clashing string tunes and one-two mystery notes. That's it and regrettably, this is Young's only score to this franchise. Sigh.The special\/practical effects still look good and the story's direction is new but with little to no clarity, the reasoning barely makes sense. Although every actor is new other than Robert Englund, none of them give showings that are remotely memorable. Grievously, even with Christopher Young composing the musical score, he too cannot help the film be but only mediocre.

","genre":"Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"18 January 2015","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" It's truly sad to see when a promising franchise starter manages to shoot itself in the foot after its first sequel. Of course for Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), was not the only movie franchise in general to achieve mainstream popularity and have a sequel made right after it. Like many others, whether it be Part 2 or just labeled with the number 2 after it, its successor ended up financially blowing away its competition but lost its critical flare that the original had. The reason behind these flaws was either the lack of the creator's involvement with the further projects or the producers decided otherwise what should be the next step in the franchise. As of right now, there's only one horror sequel that manages to complete its narrative in two successful steps and that's John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) and Halloween II (1981).Here fans are introduced to Jesse Walsh (Mark Patton), the newest tenant living in 1428 Elm Street, the same house that Krueger appeared in 1984. After a few nights of some intense dreams involving Krueger (Robert Englund) wanting Jesse to kill for him, his friends Lisa Webber (Kim Myers) and Ron Grady (Robert Rusler) begin to notice and try to figure out what's going on. The sequel to A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) doesn't make sense in a number of areas. As his first writing job, David Chaskin didn't modify the script in any way to enhance the story that was told prior. His first mistake is the title; Freddy's Revenge? Who is Krueger getting revenge on? He got his revenge at the end of the first entry. This also completely puts into question what are Freddy's motivations. Why does Freddy want Jesse to kill for him? If its to avoid having people think Freddy Krueger is back, the reason seems pointless. Nobody believes what they don't see anyway. Jack Sholder's direction in the plot is interesting but if looked at deeper, it just doesn't add up. The only thing Chaskin does correctly is continuing to maintain connections to the first nightmare by introducing Nancy's diary, which gives the characters a sparknotes edition of the events before. Although even that may come into question because I don't clearly remember Nancy ever writing down anything about her experiences. The main actors do give believable performances for the situations they encounter but unfortunately, they aren't attachable. Mark Patton and his co-stars can portray emotion but they just aren't the same likable cast. The only actor who comes out unscathed is Robert Englund just because he's playing Krueger like he always has. The only difference here is that he no longer has a connection to these specific characters other than one of the individuals living in 1428 Elm Street.Even actor Marshall Bell has a minor role but for those who are familiar with Bell's other roles, they might already know where he's headed. The cinematography provided by Jacques Haitkin (who worked on the first nightmare) and Christopher Tufty manage to keep the look of the first with various lighting and colors. However, the creativity behind the dream sequences isn't as frequent anymore either. And when the scene shifts to a dream, the scenes focus more on the surroundings than what Krueger can do. Instead, the big thing going for when Krueger is around is that everything gets molten hot. That's nice because in some cases it did look good for the practical and special effects used. However more could have been done too. A good example of this is one dream sequence that is skin crawling. For a minute I actually thought it was real.This leads to the horror aspect of the picture. Is it scary? Well, for horror fans no but they should still have fun watching it. As for anyone else who's not used to Krueger already, they will be scared. The makeup on Krueger is still slimy and gross and his method of killing is still grotesque and ugly. Can you imagine being killed by rusty claws? Ewww,...at least clean them. The music produced by horror composer Christopher Young is an unfortunate let down too. Young who would later prove himself with Clive Barker's Hellraiser (1987) score, manages to only make the score to this sequel only creepy and not scare inducing. For some reason, Young also did not include composer Charles Bernstein's original theme from the first movie and its sad because Young probably could have enhanced such a unforgettable cue.

The 3 main characters the Narrator (Edward Norton), Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), and Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) all completely astonished me, and changed my notions on the ability and importance of acting. Norton does a brilliant job at portraying the typical American man, in your typical American society, while gradually losing his sanity until he hits rock bottom. Carter was quite a surprise too, beforehand I was only familiar with her work in the Harry Potter series, so I had never imagined her as that good of an actress until watching FC. But the focal point of interest here in acting was none other than Brad Pitt. Prior to FC, I was a bit disappointed with this man's work. I thought he was rather bland in comparison to the praise he received. Boy, was I wrong. In his character as Tyler Durden, we seem him develop into this incredibly intriguing, complex, nihilistic, cynical, humorous, and likable character. Hell, there aren't enough adjectives and lectures to describe his character. The way Pitt portrays this character is the definition of shock value..... he looks as if he is literally losing his mental state in some scenes to the point whether you question Brad's mental stability rather than Tyler's. So, combining a character with so much depth, with the perfect actor to play him, in my book rules him as the most memorable character of all time (for now). Nearly every line is quotable, there are multiple stunning scenes and fascinating subjects and themes less explored (consumerism, nihilsm, etc...) the concept is something rare but beautiful, and to top it all off, all of this is executed perfectly. FC is very dark, disturbing, harsh, cruel, but also exacting, blunt, truthful, mindful, and ingenious. The dialogue is also flawless, I already praised the quotes but a lot of the conversations and narration all around is just excellent.Anybody trying to disown the film of its merits is either biased against Fincher (it's not exactly cool to like his work), a conformist to those biased, a simplistic individual, someone who thinks in black and white, or a pretentious, contrarian critic who believes the whole movie is exaggerated, when1.

At the start of the movie he's been recruited by a guy named Tilghman (Kevin Tighe) to clean up his little rat hole of a club called the Double Deuce in this equally crappy little town of Jasper, MO (supposedly outside of Kansas City..just how far outside they don't say).Not long after he arrives, Dalton sets out to rid the DD of all kinds of criminal riff raff, and in the process steps on the toes of Brad Wesley, the town kingpin (Ben Gazzara) who's been extorting every business in town and wants to keep things just as they are.Now you would think that Dalton, upon realizing that Tilghman didn't tell him the whole story about the criminal element of Jasper, would have taken his advance and high-tailed it out of that little dump of a town, right? Wrong! He's befriended some of the locals there, so he sticks around, and has confrontation after confrontation with Wesley's various goons, including his psychotic enforcer named Jimmy. It makes for some great fight scenes, with Dalton and the rest of the bouncers in his charge beating up the punks and sending them on their way (this is a guy movie to its very core).

John Henry Patterson (Kilmer) has been assigned to build a bridge in Tsavo, Africa, but an already difficult task has been made even worse when lion attacks start happening within the main camp grounds not long after his arrival. Patterson kills a lion they think is responsible for the attacks and so work recommences. Unfortunately, the attacks continue but it soon comes to light that it's not just one lion who's attacking the workers, but two.

Ignoring the fact that he was a baddie in the Mummy Returns, he's now our hero. And for good reason &#x96; he's so damn lovable! It's hard not to root for him, even in a film that really isn't that good. Not that that applies to The Scorpion King. It's great fun. Hardly a classic, but just good fun. And, I'll wager that the demographic most likely to appreciate it would be young boys (or men like me who are still into sword and sorcery etc &#x96; I think that qualifies me as a 'geek'). I can see gangs of young lads crowding round the telly on a Saturday afternoon to watch the Rock beat countless faceless baddies to a pulp.You certainly don't need to have seen any of the Mummy movies to enjoy this. Although both films are definitely in the 'action\/adventure' genre, they don't really feel alike. It's basically a 'stand-alone' movie which is only related to its predecessor by the one central character and it's more at home among the 'sword and sandals' films than with the Mummy trilogy.It has a very basic plot. Every scene is a set-up for the next and everything everyone says is an important plot point that will have some significance later on. The goodies are good and the baddies are very easy to spot. Sometimes a film uses the tool of having the hero and the villain constantly squaring off against each other, playing off each other. However, here we have possibly the most stereotypical villain ever. He shouts. He bawls. He wants to marry women who he knows hate him. He wants to conquer the world and has a habit of killing any of his men who displease him. He's not that great to be honest, but, seeing as it's The Rock's movie and not his, it doesn't really matter.

Where was the action? Where was the incident? Where was the dialogue?Now, at the age of 30, I've had the privilege of seeing it on the big screen at the BFI Southbank and you can consider me a convert. I'm not going to call it easy going, but it's an exquisitely beautiful film with a sense of real weight to it.The plot concerns mankind's progress as it's guided by unseen aliens, whose only interaction with the human race is to leave ominous- looking black monoliths in various locations for it to find, each of which has an obscure yet undeniable effect on those who find it. A plot like this could lend itself to heavy-handed moralising - the monoliths, after all, are teaching tools - but the film's brilliance is in the way it keeps its plot in the background. There is no overt message for the audience to absorb; the aliens' motives, such as they are, are never revealed and the audience is invited to speculate on the role the monoliths really have and what the final outcome is to be.In the meantime, the human race is required to prove itself worthy of the monoliths. The first one is given free to the hominid species, but subsequent monoliths are more carefully hidden and require some effort to locate; the second, for example, is placed on the moon and must therefore wait there for four million years before humanity's technology progresses to the point of being able to uncover it. The second monolith seems more accessible in relative terms, but the spacecraft crew sent to find it are beset by a murderous, malfunctioning computer. While the link between the HAL 9000 and monolith plot line is never made clear, I like to think they have something to do with each other; HAL effectively represents the next obstacle for humanity to overcome, and Dave Bowman, through his resourcefulness and bravery, outwits a superior intelligence and proves himself worthy of the film's extraordinary ending sequence.Throughout, a link is drawn between technology and weaponry, and it seems as if technology is a phase that mankind has to go through on its journey to something more pure. The apes' reaction to the first monolith is to learn to create weapons out of bones, therefore coming to dominate their environment and leading - via a startling piece of editing - to the evolution of the human race as an assertive and spacefaring species. It's never made clear whether the second monolith on the moon leads in any direct way to the creation of HAL, but I will suggest that these supercomputers are conspicuous by their absence in the scenes prior to its uncovering in the Tycho crater. The final image of the star-child, on the other hand, is technology-free, bookending the film - mankind has in some respects regressed to a natural state, but in a form that has passed technology by and no longer has any use for it. In these terms, the difference between HAL and the apes' bone-weapons becomes slight.The film is the embodiment of Clarke's own law, that any sufficiently-advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. It is not meant that Bowman should understand the experience of the ending, and nor is it meant for us to walk away from the film with more answers than questions. It's a film that's simultaneously optimistic in its faith in humanity to overcome the trials of the universe, but also terrifying in its Lovecraftian subtext that mankind is a tiny part of something huge, and its purpose within a greater plan is not for it to know. Perhaps the film encourages us to believe that there's a plan at all, or perhaps it presents mankind as incidental - are we just an idle fancy for the aliens?

Now we start to examine the backbone of the movie more and it's a little hard for me to swallow sometimes. I'm also not a big fan of BAD TASTE, another Jackson indie flick that I find has an over- hyped reputation. To me, the humor is just stupid. Maybe it's a cultural divide, maybe it's just me. Every time the movie goes for a laugh I find myself rolling my eyes. Then, there's the bad Raimi playdough style effects that also cheapen the movie. Some horror fans find an affinity for those low budget effects, but they just look bad to me.What is my final opinion of the movie, then? I guess I'm not entirely sure. I think it's a fun movie that's an absolute essential for the gorehound in search of a bloody movie and it holds a lot of appeal there, but just be prepared for a cheesy romance story with some bad effects and some even worse Kiwi humor.

It is an average, mildly enjoyable movie with some impressive elements to it. However, with so many shark movies out there, there needs to be something that sets a flick apart from the rest. For as many good points that Deep Blue Sea achieves, its mediocrities end up sinking a lot of good will. First, the good Director Renny Harlin knew enough that audiences going into a shark movie wanted several things 1) good-looking sharks 2) creative shark attacks 3) good-looking actorsIn descending importance. Luckily, the first point was hit spot on with some very good-looking animatronic sharks (when they are used). These giant metal monsters looked very nice (especially when one is used to an ocean of Italian rubber-shark ripoffs) and you as a viewer could easily get lost in the world of the movie - in the sense that yes, these must be real sharks.The second point was helped out by the film's setting, the abandoned sea lab Aquatica. It has a great cold industrial look to it. By flooding and destroying the area thanks to plot contrivances, Harlin had sharks in creative locales swimming around in corridors, hiding in bedrooms, and attacking in elevator shafts. These are new and fun ways to spice up the fact that as a movie-going threat, sharks often do little else other than pop up to chomp on someone in a jump-scare Gotcha! moment. The setting does help though, like a shark forcing the station's cook into an oven and inadvertently turning it on with the cook inside, or an entertaining helicopter kill (clever sharks!).Finally, the cast put in a somewhat serviceable (for this genre) movie. Samuel Jackson stole the show, acting as we are accustomed to see him act; though the moments where he was not yelling are compelling as well. Saffron Burrows did well as the attractive woman with a British accent (always a plus), and Thomas Jane sort of did the tough action guy who don't play by the rules thing. The rest of the crew (with a notable exception) was just sort of there, but at least we had attractive and likable leads.Despite the money and care that went into the film though, its negative points started to sink its more laudable aspects1) CGI sharks with bad CGI people 2) Good characters killed off; bad characters surviving 3) Stupid plot decisions that bring down the movieIn the special features of the DVD, Harlin went on at length about how needed something more than mechanical sharks to do all the scenes he had in mind. He turned to digital sharks here, and boasted that the audience would never be able to tell the difference.Well, this is hazarding a guess, but if you notice a character suddenly replaced with a stiff, lifeless, textureless, plastic-looking computerized Barbie doll, bank your money on the shark being CG as well. Also, if you notice that the sharks are suddenly 100x more agile they were in other scenes, those probably are also not really there. I can understand the desire to one-up other shark movies (because of the sort of limited nature of filming practical-effects sharks I mentioned above). However, the solution Harlin opted for doesn't exactly thrill. Awful looking digital chunks of your favorite nondescript actors filled the screen with strangely-smooth and plastic-looking sharks. It's groan-inducing each time I saw it happen. Contrasting that to the underwater scenes filmed with the animatronic models, and we realize that nothing can substitute for a cleverly-staged model. Most people already know one of the big twists in Deep Blue Sea, but suffice to say, the more likable characters do not all survive. In their place we have LL Cool J,. Some reviews pegged him as the audience favorite, and I don't know why. He didn't act very well, his script is pretty lousy outside of one throwaway joke about an omelet, and the movie spent far too much time on him. While exciting things were happening elsewhere, we had to listen to the comedy stylings of LL Cool J and his foul-mouthed parrot. As for the plot, I didn't talk about it much because I don't really care about plots in a movie with sharks. All these movies need is a premise that is not so outside of reality that it works. And big brain sharks hunt humans was inoffensive enough to work. However, certain decisions made by the characters added up. For example, characters watching a window crack for nearly 40 seconds before they decide that being in front of a breaking-glass-window under the sea is a bad idea. One character pointlessly baiting the shark in a way that is needlessly life-endangering. Situations seemed to be set up in order to kill off characters (usually when we haven't seen a shark attack in a while). Such situational character stupidity was a lame way of killing people off, especially when the treat we got was bad CGI. Even Italian shark knockoffs have the decency to give us gore effects.After all of this negativity, was Deep Blue Sea a bad film? Not necessarily. The action scenes with the sharks had some creativity and were handled competently by Harlin. There were explosions and gushes of water (and shark deaths) to keep the audience's attention. The movie provided some of the bare-bones minimums a shark movie needs, and by having multiple mechanical sharks, it went a few steps beyond most shark movies.However, it was definitely a film I have no desire to see again. The final gut reaction I felt was well, it was OK. The movie certainly did not offend me, and I enjoyed several scenes and situations within.But was that really the reaction I should have to a movie about super killer sharks?

Although his acting was excellent in this film, I don't believe that he should have been Oscar nominated. Likewise, Foxx and several of the supporting characters were also excellent. The film was also well-shot and generally well-made and from a technical aspect it was a fairly polished product. Unfortunately, that's where the praise for this film ends....For me there was far too much time spent on dull aspects of Ali's life such as Ali's various relationships - this aspect of his life got way too much focus and it did, at times, make the film feel like an over-long combination of melodrama and soap opera. At the same time, other potentially more interesting or important areas seemed to either have been ignored or glossed over - there's very little focus on Ali's training, no real mention of his family. Considering the film is over 2 and a half hours long I expected there to be a reasonable amount of boxing and\/or training, but we're probably treated to about 30 minutes of boxing (if that) and then 2 hours of melodrama and soap opera. I'm sure a lot of what I describe as 'melodrama' and 'soap opera' type events did occur in Ali's life, but these elements don't make for an entertaining film and should have been kept to a minimum.All of the above isn't helped by the fact that the screenplay felt like it was put together in a haphazard way - the writers would shift from one aspect of Ali's life to another in quick succession barely giving you chance to digest what you've just seen.Although from a technical perspective this film was generally well put together and polished I did feel that the camera work during the boxing matches was pretty poor and as a result I didn't feel quite as involved in the action as I did when I've watched other boxing films. This came as a really big disappointment when you consider how poor many other elements of the film were.Aside from the great performances, there really isn't much else going for this film. My feeling are that it was an over-long soap opera with a bit of boxing thrown in here and there. If you want to see a good boxing biopic then I would recommend Cinderella Man. Muhammad Ali may be the Greatest, but this film certainly isn't.

With the legalization of the pot in Washington, Oregon, and soon to be Alaska in 2015, drugs can be political and are often talked around my high school; for example If weed should be legal or not. I will also say high school is where sadly I am most exposed to drugs. You know who the drug dealers are, who's been arrested over it and I can't tell you how times in my study hour I have overheard a story about a local party involving the drugs and alcohol.Yes, there are stoner films but films that have a plot of a person dealing with a drug addiction are not that common. It is hard to an find audience for these films which have a depressing atmosphere. The one film that should always to mind with drug addiction though is Less then ZeroBlair (Jami Gertz), Clay Eaton (Andrew McCarthy) and Julian Wells (Rober Downey Jr.) are all college age kids during Christmas time in affluent Los Angeles. Blair and Clay are a former couple who's relationship faltered after Blair cheated on him with Julian leaving all three friends in a awkward stance. During this Christmas break, we learn that Julian now has a severe drug problem and sometimes sleeps on a cliff on a beach due to the fact that's his parents kicked him out of the house. Julian also can't pay off his drug debt to drug dealer Rip (James Spader). It is part drug film, part relationship film.Truthfully, these are somewhat simple lead characters. These are characters who are trying their best to get away from high school problems and are trying to get a foot in the real world. It is the Downey character who is the most interesting. Director Marek Kanievska does a good job of making you feel like you have already known Julian. With some great acting by Downey, you are truly frustrated with his antics and you have no confidence that he is going to stop buying drugs like says he will. You do want him to get better because you miss that cocky, smart-ass character that briefly appears before he becomes stoned and strung out. It is hard to like Blair because of the cheating and she could possibly go down the same road as Julian but she eventually does find herself. The McCarthy character doesn't have much substance compared to the others and he is truly the only character with a clean record and you do have respect for how he tries to save his friend. Released in 1987, we do see the 80's fashion\/style, and 1980's Los Angeles culture is a major theme in the film. These are all kids who parents never had money troubles, who think it is normal to wear suits and dresses every day and drive flashy cars. This rich culture is presented to us in a way that fits very nicely into the drug plot.Less Than Zero won't seem to be a stand-out film. It is mostly remembered for being an 80's film and some of it's cast and an ironically Downey had severe drugs problems afterwards in the 90's but we should remember Less Than Zero more for how well it is made. It is a close to flawless movie with to the heartfelt message that never gives up on what it is trying to say.
