There are many majestic shots filmed from high in cathedrals and castles that show the beauty of Gothic and Norman craftsmanship. Colorful costumes and set dressing make ELIZABETH a feast for the eye from start to finish.Also to note are the bookending shots of long red hair being cut off first of the female martyr, and finally of Elizabeth herself. A nice touch.Besides, I'll always support a queen who can defeat Dr. Who (Eccleston) and James Bond (Craig) in the same film.

Clint Eastwood acts and directs in such a Western where the heroic iconography of the gunslinger is put directly into question.Eastwood plays Munny, the type of infamous anti-hero the West learned to love who rowdied it up, held his own, and is responsible for the death of many tall men. Except at the point at which the story starts, he's mostly a burned out and unsuccessful pig farmer whose only memory of his own iconographic anti-heroic deeds is, I was drunk most of the time and, as revealed later, always real lucky. Munny is, however, brought back into the life of high-falutin' gun-slingin' action excellence when a young, wet-behind-the-ears aspiring criminal comes along and engages Munny to partner with him to hunt down some cowboys that cut up a woman a particularly violent and vicious opening scene that is one of many reasons why this movie continually sticks out in people's minds.The problem, however, is that that woman is a prostitute in a town run by bad-guy sheriff Little Bill (Gene Hackman), who as well as being unfair to the prostitutes who demand fair treatment is also a pretty sadistic authoritarian, though he has his own charms when it comes to telling a pulp writer from the East all about the end of the era of Western heroes (reflecting once again the primary theme of the movie). Eventually Little Bill's aggression and Munny's slow spiral back into his old ways are, of course, going to result in that classic showdown at the end of the movie that the audience is waiting for (and only slightly goes against the whole theme of the movie).However, in the meantime there's some great storytelling to be done by Eastwood, who has proved time and time again to be a master director. Characters are given a lot of space to be fully fleshed out, and the acting is good on many levels, leaving for a very realized image of the community. Landscape photography shows the beauty of the West (ironic because Unforgiven wasn't even shot in the West) while dialog alludes to the trains and barbed-wire fences that will soon end it. And book-shelving intertitles help present a focus on what it is that redeems Munny, if anything at all (besides the fact that he's the hero of the story, of course).--PolarisDiB ","genre":null},{"date":"12 February 2008","score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Arguably the best Westerns were the last ones created, and the last Westerns created were quite often about the end of the West.
