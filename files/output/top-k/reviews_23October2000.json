I don't think there's much questioning the fact that Batman is the best movie of the franchise.  The next three wouldn't even come close to achieving the same grandeur of classic good versus evil comic book heroism as the first.But to truly do Batman justice, one must look into the atmosphere created by the incredibly talented Tim Burton and his amazing cast & crew. Most notably, there is the acting of Jack Nicholson.  He makes the Joker a true bad guy...a psychotic but nevertheless effective crime boss.  Then there's Michael Keaton, who's somber and morose demeanor perfectly demonstrates Bruce Wayne's life, a life torn by childhood tragedy (unlike good ol' Mr. Clooney, who wants us to believe that the character of Batman is hot stuff).  Kim Basinger...Grrrrrr.  Top it off with Jack Palance, Billy Dee Williams, Robert Wuhl, Pat Hingle, and Michael Gogh,  and you've got a set of professionals, not a slew of show-offs (can anyone say Tommy Lee Jones? What about Arnold?).Anton Furst designs the greatest (and ironically the most conservative) Batmobile ever, as well as a breath-taking, academy award-winning Gotham City.  Danny Elfman's score is amazing. In fact, I place the theme to Batman as one of the greatest classical pieces ever.So how does this all fit together to make one of the best movies ever? Critics said the action scenes were lax, and the movie was just too dark. WHAT DO YOU WANT, EBERT? MALTIN? The action was downright realistic.  And what, do you think the war on crime takes place in sunny fields of lavender? The point is that the movie is a realistic depiction of a fantastic comic book series.  When you look at it, every element of this movie is perfectly accurate to what would actually happen.  Batman is dark and refined because his parents were killed when he was a child.  The action scenes are limited because normal people can't leap, bound, and travel at mach 1 like some people wish. Etc., etc.Okay, I'm on the threshold of digression.  Just do yourself a favor and watch this movie again.  Hell, it was the 14th highest grossing movie of all time for a REASON. If, after taking all of the aforementioned factors into consideration, you do not find this movie to be truly magnificent, at least try to understand how it can be the favorite of a young, conservative, adult male like myself.Long live Burton and the first and finest installment of the Batman franchise.

He is then threatened to be killed by the man who gave him the &#145;order'. The objective now is to get 50 cars stolen in 3 days, with the help of Randall (Nicolas Cage), a &#145;retired' booster and also Kip's brother and a couple of old friends of Randall's. As you can see this is the same old, big bro' needs to get lil' bro' out of trouble routine and of course Randall is the best thief there ever was. Of course as in all other movies there are also a few setbacks and surprises you never would have thought of, but at times it is predictable too, so there is nothing fancy about the story. You are by now probably wondering why this is about 51 times the HOT STUFF, since there are only 50 beautiful, fast, cool and expensive cars to be stolen. Well the other hot item in this film is Sway (Angelina Jolie (who will be a big STAR (trust me))). She is not only very convincing in the role as a car theft, but she is pretty hot too. OK not hot as in pretty, but hot as in damn cool and sexy. She was very believable in this role, probably because she is some kind of a wild woman in real life too (don't believe me, read her biography) and for the sexy part well just see for yourself man. I only know, that she plays the kind of girl I like in this film, because she is not too mainstream, a bit alternative look and she even comes with a tattoo.OK the only downsides I felt while watching this movie was, that there is not very much action, there is one totally unrealistic scene, the story is only OK and that there are not much jokes. Hey but after seeing the whole film I must say WHO CARES. Why must I say that, well because it was still entertaining; had a couple of cool car chases; good music; some Bruckheimer scenes (where the combination of music and the lines of actors make your eyes go wet); good actors who all did their jobs; pretty cars; one cool, wild, sexy lady (yes, I mean Mrs. Jolie) and last but not least very nice and cool tools to boost the cars with. So some downsides here but still a pretty good and entertaining movie. All in all the best way to describe this film is that it is an overall OK movie with a cool &#150; feelgood ending.As for Nicolas Cage, well&#133; He is actually one of my most favourite actors in the action genre nowadays after such good films as The Rock, Con Air, Face \/ Off, Snake Eyes and finally this one. Plus what actor has had so many good action \/ thriller's in the last years and such successful ones ? Well no one!!! Maybe Jackie Chan, but he is one of my favourites too. One thing that is true though about Mr. Cages Bruckheimer films is that they keep getting worse. The Rock, was a clear 9, Con air was a nice 8 and this well this clearly is a 7. Not that that mark is bad. Does it not show that his films under Bruckheimer keep getting worse and that maybe Cage has to think longer before he accepts a role in a movie and probably he should make a few less movies ? No it doesn't show us that, because almost all of Cage's films were successful in the last few years, except for 8mm and Bringing out the Dead. 8mm was not great, I admit that, but that was never Cage's fault and the story seemed good to me. About the latter film I can not say anything, &#145;cause I have not seen it yet. One thing though I know for sure, if Bruckheimer would have asked me for those three films, I would have said YES to all of them. I would have said yes to The Rock, because the story was great and because you would get to play with Sean Connery and Ed Harris. I would have said yes to Con Air, because there would be a lot of action in it, because the story was good and because you got to act with John Malkovich and Ving Rhames. In this one I would have starred because I would have gotten a big paycheque, I would have been able to ride some cool and fast cars and because I would have been able to kiss Angelina Jolie (can't wait to see her in that Lara Croft outfit). This one was a good choice of Mr. Cage and it certainly was worth a look at in the theatre.7 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 October 2000","score":"25 out of 50 people found the following review useful","review":"  To make it short and not to spoil everything this film is about Kip (Giovanni Ribsi), a car thief, who messes up a big delivery of stolen cars (50 in total).

OK not hot as in pretty, but hot as in damn cool and sexy. She was very believable in this role, probably because she is some kind of a wild woman in real life too (don't believe me, read her biography) and for the sexy part well just see for yourself man. I only know, that she plays the kind of girl I like in this film, because she is not too mainstream, a bit alternative look and she even comes with a tattoo.OK the only downsides I felt while watching this movie was, that there is not very much action, there is one totally unrealistic scene, the story is only OK and that there are not much jokes. Hey but after seeing the whole film I must say WHO CARES. Why must I say that, well because it was still entertaining; had a couple of cool car chases; good music; some Bruckheimer scenes (where the combination of music and the lines of actors make your eyes go wet); good actors who all did their jobs; pretty cars; one cool, wild, sexy lady (yes, I mean Mrs. Jolie) and last but not least very nice and cool tools to boost the cars with. So some downsides here but still a pretty good and entertaining movie. All in all the best way to describe this film is that it is an overall OK movie with a cool &#150; feelgood ending.As for Nicolas Cage, well&#133; He is actually one of my most favourite actors in the action genre nowadays after such good films as The Rock, Con Air, Face \/ Off, Snake Eyes and finally this one. Plus what actor has had so many good action \/ thriller's in the last years and such successful ones ? Well no one!!! Maybe Jackie Chan, but he is one of my favourites too. One thing that is true though about Mr. Cages Bruckheimer films is that they keep getting worse. The Rock, was a clear 9, Con air was a nice 8 and this well this clearly is a 7. Not that that mark is bad. Does it not show that his films under Bruckheimer keep getting worse and that maybe Cage has to think longer before he accepts a role in a movie and probably he should make a few less movies ? No it doesn't show us that, because almost all of Cage's films were successful in the last few years, except for 8mm and Bringing out the Dead. 8mm was not great, I admit that, but that was never Cage's fault and the story seemed good to me. About the latter film I can not say anything, &#145;cause I have not seen it yet. One thing though I know for sure, if Bruckheimer would have asked me for those three films, I would have said YES to all of them. I would have said yes to The Rock, because the story was great and because you would get to play with Sean Connery and Ed Harris. I would have said yes to Con Air, because there would be a lot of action in it, because the story was good and because you got to act with John Malkovich and Ving Rhames. In this one I would have starred because I would have gotten a big paycheque, I would have been able to ride some cool and fast cars and because I would have been able to kiss Angelina Jolie (can't wait to see her in that Lara Croft outfit). This one was a good choice of Mr. Cage and it certainly was worth a look at in the theatre.7 out of 10 ","genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller"},{"date":"23 October 2000","score":"25 out of 50 people found the following review useful","review":"  To make it short and not to spoil everything this film is about Kip (Giovanni Ribsi), a car thief, who messes up a big delivery of stolen cars (50 in total). He is then threatened to be killed by the man who gave him the &#145;order'. The objective now is to get 50 cars stolen in 3 days, with the help of Randall (Nicolas Cage), a &#145;retired' booster and also Kip's brother and a couple of old friends of Randall's. As you can see this is the same old, big bro' needs to get lil' bro' out of trouble routine and of course Randall is the best thief there ever was. Of course as in all other movies there are also a few setbacks and surprises you never would have thought of, but at times it is predictable too, so there is nothing fancy about the story.

The samurai don't even reach the village in danger until more than 30 minutes into the film, all that time being spent getting to know each of the characters and the motivation and history behind them. We get to truly learn what it takes to be a samurai, and what truly sets them apart. By the time we arrive at the village we have become attached to some of the samurai in a very personal way, respecting each of them in their own way.

Unfortunately, Pay it Forward was no different and I didn't like the ending.  It had a formulaic ending in which the main character dies to make the point of the story. However, the scene in which this happens is totally unbelievable.  From the point that Trevor is stabbed I felt totally taken out of the movie.  I no longer felt any emotion from the what was happening on the screen.  The ending was contrived to rip tears out of the audience.With all of the violence that happens in the world today it would be nice to see Hollywood put out a feel good happy ending drama that I could take my kids to see.  If I wanted to see a sad story that ends in the violent taking of a child's life I would watch the news more often.  I think the screenwriter should have taken a chance and ended the movie on a positive note, while that may have not been the popular thing to do, it would have made the movie much better.

Both learned their lesson the hard way and entrusted their empire to someone who'll most likely destroy it in the long run.

It does so because of the flimsy screenplay. I have always said the characters should drive the plot, not the other way around. Here, however, characters seem to be doing things simply for the sake of the plot. The prime example is the relationship between Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt. First he doesn't want to get involved, then she dumps him- it's a roller coaster of emotions that I didn't buy for a second. Then we have Kevin Spacey's tearful confession on how he got burned- oh so sad, also so obvious if you didn't see it coming, you're brain dead. As well, who couldn't see the ending coming from the first five minutes when we see the kid with the knife? The only reason to introduce the kid with the knife is to have him stab somebody- and of course it will be poor Haley Joel- dying like a Jesus for our sins. Please!!!

The reputation of Star Wars made this film. I  will not excuse it of it's horrid production however. You can serve a beautiful cuisine with elaborate colors and garnishes, but if it tastes like cardboard, what's it matter?First of all, I can understand that Star Wars as a genre is a silly sci-fi film. Was it meant to be serious? Probably in Lucas' mind but even Mr. Harrison Ford states that maybe someone other than Lucas should be penning the story. Of course the best  interpretation of an idea is the one who thinks of it first. However, George Lucas excels in bringing eye candy to us all. The aliens, the scenery. NOT the story. The dialogue is the prime killer of this film. When I hear Qui-Gon praise Obi-wan that he will one day become a great Jedi Knight, and a much more wiser man one day might I add, after being scolded and led around like a clueless student, I shudder. What has Obi-Wan done in the film that deserves that remark besides an absurd attempt to foreshadow? Maybe that one sword fight in the end? Qui-Gon is the MAIN Jedi of the film. Obi-Wan, well he was there because he had to be there. The Queen, maybe its her character but shes reading lines from cardboard. Padme? I like her, but what's so unique about her? She can shoot guns and dodge guns like her bodyguard? Who needs the bodyguard then if she could do all that. See the end of the film when they try to retake Naboo and you'll see what I'm talking about. Speaking of, I found this absurd as well. If the Queen is the decoy, the bodyguard. She seems to be fit to rule as well. Why would they refer to her, talk to her, in the beginning of the film when NO one but her trusted Council is there. Does Padme not trust her own people? Or is she unfit to rule so they consult with the bodyguard instead.Alot of people loathe Jar-Jar Binks. I don't abhor his character, he's an alien. So, some act peculiar to us standards. However, I do have someone I totally detest in the film. Anakin Skywalker. Why did they envisioned Jake Lloyd as Anakin? So he could play this cute little kid who makes light of every situation and cracks out the lame lines that they give him? I feel so much pity for the dead pilots of the assault on the Trade Federation Controlship. These are, I assume, trained pilots risking their lives to save their planet. Obviously I was terribly mistaken as they were actually saved by this little kid who somehow maneuvers better than any of them shouting out, Now this is pod racing! or the classic Let's try spinning, thats a good trick!. Or how about firing those torpedoes and that disabled the entire controlship. How fragile and flimsy of the aliens that an internal implosion would destroy it. Granted that MIGHT have been its power source or whatever, WHY was it exposed near a docking bay full of ships that can shoot torpedoes? Was that the force guiding young Anakin? Give me a break. Last but not least, the android army. Giving them ranks was, um, for lack of better term retarded. I don't feel like going into why. I will say they are plainly cannon fodder. The Jedi are good, but not the way Qui and Obi displayed that they could disable 20 androids at once. How slow are they? Heaven forbid even in one scene during a heavy fight, an android had its back on Obi-Wan looking like a lost idiot. Any guesses what happens?Star Wars doesn't deserve all the hype, and it shouldn't. The Box-Office says otherwise, but that's what hype gets you, refer to Mission Impossible II please. The accolades will show you what the film is made of. Sure it's full of neat scenery, great special effects, and an impressive score with one extremely annoying Parade song, but what is all that without good dialogue? Phantom Menace may as well be one of the greatest silence films of all time if you hit the Mute button.

The reputation of Star Wars made this film. I  will not excuse it of it's horrid production however. You can serve a beautiful cuisine with elaborate colors and garnishes, but if it tastes like cardboard, what's it matter?First of all, I can understand that Star Wars as a genre is a silly sci-fi film. Was it meant to be serious? Probably in Lucas' mind but even Mr. Harrison Ford states that maybe someone other than Lucas should be penning the story. Of course the best  interpretation of an idea is the one who thinks of it first. However, George Lucas excels in bringing eye candy to us all. The aliens, the scenery. NOT the story.
