Its really fun to watch, and i say that as an intelligent person having scored a really high IQ, speaking 8 languages, having a PhD in medicine.Critics hate this movie for some reason. Sure i understand that some part are truly badly executed, like the scene where group is taken out for mining tests, where some cavemen attack, and like in 20 seconds after a short speech, the pledge their life to a man, a leader that the just met and they will obey everything he wants. Also its really fun when they find a nuclear bomb and open it up after 1000 years and its operational and they fiddle with the trigger and the bomb is making all kinds of warning noises. Really nukes do that didn't you know. Also amazing that they had electricity after 1000 years in that building, and of course the Harriers, a marvel of human engeneering, lasting a 1000years with filled tanks.Yes some loopholes in the plot but the acting from Mr Travolta is amazing, and of course his co-partner in crime Mr Whitaker, one of my absolutely favorite black actors does an superamazing job in this movie.The aliens are surely somewhat Klingon-looking but i think there are quite drastic differences. They are much smarter than Klingons and highly profitminded, and much funnier walking. I truly enjoy their hunt for profit since it very much resembles human hunt for profit. My own observations of todays world is that profit nowadays conquers altruism and true philanthrophy.One really fun plothole that i think everyone else has missed it that leader is taught maths from a completely different extraterrestial life form but the math is having earth symbols and number format from 1 to 10. Fun. And B. But i have watched this movie several times and loving it every time.
