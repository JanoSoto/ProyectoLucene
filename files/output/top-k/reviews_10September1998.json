Or, conversely, it might be cool to *hate* everything popular without thinking about it.  This seems to be the basis of most amateur reviews of Titanic I 've read.  The truth is that this is a terrific film which emotionally chronicles the death of 1500 people on a doomed luxury liner.  Every movie needs a plot, though, or the fantastic last third of the film would have no meaning.  I am not a particular fan or detractor of either Leo, Kate, or James, but all three work their professions to perfection.  Jim writes and directs the film with real feeling and intelligence, and only in the movies is dialogue also perfect.  There is never any confusion as to what is going on at any moment, and Leo and Kate both give outstanding performances as the doomed lovers.  The historical characters are cast with uncanny resemblance (especially E. J. Smith), and the effects are so perfect that you hardly realize that what you're looking at is not real, and probably wouldn't know if you hadn't been told.  Horner's soundtrack is at first wondrous, and becomes haunting as Titanic's fate is sealed.  My only bone is that Cameron doesn't know port from starboard.  The bottom line is that this is one of few films I've seen where the fate of the characters is of utmost importance to the viewer.  You know Kate survives the wreck, and Kathy Bates as well, but what about the rest.  These characters have the feeling of being real, breathing, men and women, and for good reason  many of them *were*.  This is not a tragedy that belongs in a pop culture tug of war.  I've seen the film only twice, and have been moved both times.  And perhaps the best thing about historical dramas like this is best summed up in Hitchcock's own view on suspense.  When the viewer knows the potential outcome, but the characters don't (Hitchcock explained it as two men at a table discussing baseball, while only the viewer is privy to the fact of a bomb ticking beneath the table). Titanic is a marvelous film, and the budget, politics, etc, involved in the Hollywood aspect of this memorable masterpiece are moot.  If the film had not won an Oscar, it would still be among the five best films in the 100 year history of cinema.

The movie works well on a number of levels and proves to be a highly entertaining action film with just a hint of something higher at work.  As an action film it is highly successful, it provides witty one liners and makes for excellent bang for your buck.  But as a social satire it also functions, it makes a healthy stab at the values we are adopting in out lives. As Science Fiction it is one of the more enjoyable outings of the late eighties.   It is interesting to note the characters in this a clever little film.  Most of the human characters seem shallow, yet logically the most shallow character (Robocop) seems to be the only human element in the film.  The movie follows a pretty predictable story line, boy makes good, boy goes out for revenge, boy is framed, boy comes back as a hero despite all odds.  Despite the lack of a surprising story, it is still is a highly entertaining film, providing as many gasps as laughs and leaves you at the end of it thinking `Hell I wanna be a Robot!'  It is however interesting to note that yes old Robo is cased in Titanium, practically invincible to the oncoming onslaught of bullets and other things nasty that no one thinks to shoot him in the mouth. Its not like he's moving too fast for them to do this. I wonder perhaps if he also has Titanium teeth.

Most of the human characters seem shallow, yet logically the most shallow character (Robocop) seems to be the only human element in the film.  The movie follows a pretty predictable story line, boy makes good, boy goes out for revenge, boy is framed, boy comes back as a hero despite all odds.  Despite the lack of a surprising story, it is still is a highly entertaining film, providing as many gasps as laughs and leaves you at the end of it thinking `Hell I wanna be a Robot!'  It is however interesting to note that yes old Robo is cased in Titanium, practically invincible to the oncoming onslaught of bullets and other things nasty that no one thinks to shoot him in the mouth.

Only to be reborn as a high tech tool of justice.  This is the first of what have become the more memorable Paul Verhoeven films and definitely the best of the Robocop series.  His almost trade mark use of blood and excessive violence is evident here and often leaves you wincing in sympathetic pain for the characters on screen, you honestly start felling sorry for some of them.  The movie works well on a number of levels and proves to be a highly entertaining action film with just a hint of something higher at work.  As an action film it is highly successful, it provides witty one liners and makes for excellent bang for your buck.  But as a social satire it also functions, it makes a healthy stab at the values we are adopting in out lives. As Science Fiction it is one of the more enjoyable outings of the late eighties.   It is interesting to note the characters in this a clever little film.

They are probably the two best war scenes ever recorded on film. The images from the beach landing will haunt me for a long time; the soldiers praying, crying, vomiting, and then dying, dying so fast and furious you don't even have time to breathe before the next one goes down. And yet they are all very human, which is what breaks your heart. The same can be said of the final battle scene. The way the momentary peace of listening to Edith Piaf singing in French while the educated young soldier interprets for the others is shattered by the rumbling of the treads of the German tanks. Your brain starts going, why is this happening? For this reason, the reality and ridiculousness of war is made clear. There are other good scenes in this poignant and terrifying film; most of the deaths are treated with the shock of cold reality and at the same time with dignity. However, I was totally disgusted by the director's 'good guy vs. bad guy' depiction of the Nazi soldiers. I'm sure that the Germans loved their mothers, too, that they were afraid to die, that they were also following orders from above, and not deranged Hitlers. The lone German character in the film is portrayed as a sick, evil clown, and that is all we're allowed to see him as. How sad that we have to do that to appreciate what our soldiers did for us. Woudldn't it have made it an even better statement if the movie had shown us how crazy war is from BOTH sides of the fence? It was an opportunity lost.Beyond that, I agree with the other viewer that I also would have appreciated seeing the daily hardships that the soldiers must have gone through; the cold, the wet, the hunger, etc. I think this would have made it a more complete and realistic film.Still, congratulations to Spielberg.
