The movie held my ADD attention span for the entire length, with me begging for more by the end.I was pleasantly surprised as I watched a possessed character stab a pencil into another's ankle and TWIST (which makes me quiver every time I see it), another character dragged mercilessly through the woods by possessed vines to ultimately be raped by a TREE (you heard right), and another possessed character pounding and screaming while trapped underneath a cellar door, antagonizing the poor Joe Schmo character of Ash.This film, needless to say, is not a happy tale and not for the family (other than the Manson family, of course). It's so shocking that I find it refreshing to watch every time I do so that I can get a break from the high budget ridiculous world of A movies.Sam Raimi makes an outstanding directorial (feature length) debut with this very original movie. Shots and angles are set up beautifully, most of which are skewed on purpose for the reason of showing the characters in a world that is unreal, which, I thought, was proper training for his future Spider-Man movies.The average movie goer though may not appreciate this film. Do you see films once every 6 months or so? Films like The Notebook, Little Miss Sunshine or Lady in the Water? Movies that you take your mom or girlfriend to? Yes? Then this movie isn't for you. The only people who can really appreciate this movie for what it is are the kind of people who have seen, and love movies such as Bubba Hotep and Man With The Screaming Brain. The B movie fans.This film is loved for all reasons. Most of all because of Bruce Campbell who portrays (beautifully) the Wimp to Leader of Men roll in this movie and it's sequels, Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness.What I like about this film is that it stands alone from it's sequels in that it was low budget and straight horror - no slapstick here, folks. Just pure gore, gore, gore. Story? Ha! Not here, sir. Too much grueling horror to take in all at once for there to be an Oscar worthy story here (Oscars are for snobby A list Hollywood types anyway). Again - that's what I love about this movie - it's simplicity, which, I think, was caused by the more than modest budget.This film, along as entertaining, is also educational in the sense of film-making. This film is easily one of the most influential for filmmakers who just want to make a good movie. Someone could easily be influenced to make a movie if they were to watch three movies - Robert Rodriguez' El Mariachi, Kevin Smith's Clerks. and this movie, Evil Dead.In a world that's over saturated with $50-$250 Million epics, it's good to see a GREAT movie made for *only* $350,000. The lower the budget, the greater the movie, in my opinion as there's no option for money to save the day should a problem on set arise. As a filmmaker I know that no money means more creativity - you have to THINK your way out of problems, rather than buy those problems away (as most movie production crews seem to do) and, believe me - this movie is creative - you'll never look at milk, creamed corn and applesauce the same way again.With talks of an Evil Dead 4 (possibly a remake) I cannot wait to see what Raimi, Tapert and Campbell have in store for us.

Although she isn't living a bad life in a bad neighbourhood. But how the teenagers are, they are rebellious, but she isn't stupid. She isn't after boys and she can see things much more clearly. Her mother is dead, so she has a reason to be how she is, she hasn't got over it. And her father is very concerned about her.She want's to escape from everything by drinking and smoking weed (like 50% of teenagers)and fooling around and playing with people. She isn't concerned about what others are thinking about her, some are thinking that she is cold and doesn't care about anything, but that's a facade.It is the kind of movie, where you don't expect a happy end, but hope for it, and you will be positively surprised.My favourite scenes are the ones, where she is photographing. She was making so beautiful photos. It seemed like those photos where having so much heart, they seemed warm and cosy. I could feel the love between Nicole and Carlos.It is also the movie, where I fell in love with Kirsten Dunst. I can't say I'm a fan of hers.

And the soundtracks were brilliant. I still like to hear them sometimes when I'm home. This movie is so romantic but also dramatic. The young girls in this movie is fighting with herself for her future. She is having problems with life. I think she is too good, so she can barely take what's happening around her. Although she isn't living a bad life in a bad neighbourhood. But how the teenagers are, they are rebellious, but she isn't stupid. She isn't after boys and she can see things much more clearly. Her mother is dead, so she has a reason to be how she is, she hasn't got over it. And her father is very concerned about her.She want's to escape from everything by drinking and smoking weed (like 50% of teenagers)and fooling around and playing with people. She isn't concerned about what others are thinking about her, some are thinking that she is cold and doesn't care about anything, but that's a facade.It is the kind of movie, where you don't expect a happy end, but hope for it, and you will be positively surprised.My favourite scenes are the ones, where she is photographing. She was making so beautiful photos. It seemed like those photos where having so much heart, they seemed warm and cosy. I could feel the love between Nicole and Carlos.It is also the movie, where I fell in love with Kirsten Dunst. I can't say I'm a fan of hers. I don't run to see a movie of hers just because...I pick out movies, that have spirit. And she is a talent in picking out movies. You should only see the list of her movies. Well, not all of them are my type of movies, but the most are. Little Women was my favourite cartoon, when I was a child. I watched the movie actually because of Claire Danes. She is also an original and has been one of my favourite actresses many years. Now Kirsten is in that category too. She is so talented and beautiful. I would say she is a deep person. And she really touched my heart. She is exactly the type of people I like personally. She brings joy to life. Not many people can be so positive.

The story telling of this film and it's relevance toward legendary accuracy is not what I am questioning for this movie. The methods of telling a tale of love, chivalry, and war used in this film are terrible.First of all, casting is an important role for any film to be a success or a failure. The actors in the movie not only have to look good in front of a camera and studio lights, which it appears is the only aspect that was taken in for First Knight, but the actors have to be able to play the part they are given convincingly. Richard Gere has the noble look, but never once in all of his movie career history has he looked the war torn, experienced fighter type. He looks no more like a real knight than the sun could be disguised as the moon, the role doesn't fit him at all. Sean Connery however could have been a good choice for King Arthur had his script been better. In this movie, he comes off as a peaceful man who'd never lift his sword for fear of straining is back. As he is a former James Bond, he also falls under the category of looking nice in front of lights and cameras despite not fulfilling a key character's role.Aside from role selection, the acting overall is weak. None of the characters are convincing of their roles. When fighting, the knights have very little to no armor and the choreography is so poorly executed that it looks as though the actors could fall over from the wind blowing as easily as they do when they hit each other. I've seen better high school film fight scenes than this movie puts forth. On that note, King Arthur, King of the Britains, never raises Excalibur, the most renowned sword in history, in battle. The only time he makes a motion to fight for himself; he slightly raises the sword and then gets shot by four arrows. These arrows and weapons are also ill convincing; I'm almost positive that crossbows the size of a small handgun, as all of Malagant's soldiers carry, were not readily available at the time that these Arthurian legends were supposedly taking place. On that note, the end of Arthur's life is not even a valiant one. How is it that the legendary King Arthur is taken down by a lowly villain's group of henchmen and a man who's betrayed all of the country by deceiving the King defeats the evil villain and takes all the spoils? I just don't understand the logic behind this kind of screenplay. Lancelot's always the one saving the queen, a woman who doesn't even want to love him, while Arthur, the man who single handedly united the kingdoms, sits back and plans matters for far too long. There isn't even a redeeming battle between Arthur and Lancelot to save this poorly written love triangle. This movie is just about making a pretty chick-flick out of a classic legend where everything ends up happy and the pretty boy takes it all. I don't recommend this for personal viewing.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Romance"},{"date":"5 February 2007","score":"4 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" The movie, First Knight by Jerry Zucker is in my opinion a terrible rendition of any Arthurian legend; granted I have yet to read the tale of Lancelot and Guinevere. The story telling of this film and it's relevance toward legendary accuracy is not what I am questioning for this movie. The methods of telling a tale of love, chivalry, and war used in this film are terrible.First of all, casting is an important role for any film to be a success or a failure. The actors in the movie not only have to look good in front of a camera and studio lights, which it appears is the only aspect that was taken in for First Knight, but the actors have to be able to play the part they are given convincingly. Richard Gere has the noble look, but never once in all of his movie career history has he looked the war torn, experienced fighter type. He looks no more like a real knight than the sun could be disguised as the moon, the role doesn't fit him at all. Sean Connery however could have been a good choice for King Arthur had his script been better. In this movie, he comes off as a peaceful man who'd never lift his sword for fear of straining is back. As he is a former James Bond, he also falls under the category of looking nice in front of lights and cameras despite not fulfilling a key character's role.Aside from role selection, the acting overall is weak. None of the characters are convincing of their roles. When fighting, the knights have very little to no armor and the choreography is so poorly executed that it looks as though the actors could fall over from the wind blowing as easily as they do when they hit each other. I've seen better high school film fight scenes than this movie puts forth. On that note, King Arthur, King of the Britains, never raises Excalibur, the most renowned sword in history, in battle. The only time he makes a motion to fight for himself; he slightly raises the sword and then gets shot by four arrows. These arrows and weapons are also ill convincing; I'm almost positive that crossbows the size of a small handgun, as all of Malagant's soldiers carry, were not readily available at the time that these Arthurian legends were supposedly taking place. On that note, the end of Arthur's life is not even a valiant one.

The Joker really has a hard time and cannot match up against Batman's skill and strength.

The slap stick style humor mixed with Stone and Parker just works flawlessly. The kind of humor present in Basketball was not popular upon the time of it's release and had it come out today it would be a hit.
