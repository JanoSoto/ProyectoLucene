Yes it is not historically accurate. Yes it is Americans and British actors playing foreign roles with no accents. Yes it is a stuffy period piece. You know what? It is also an absolute masterpiece of a movie! The story manages to work on multiple levels. Yes the surface message deals with the price of revenge, but it is so much more personal than that. We see that Sallieri has become his own worst enemy purely because he cannot let go of his jealousy. He cannot just accept the skills of others and move on with his own already successful career. This is also paralleled in the life of Mozart, shown here as a childish genius who is trapped in his own prison of inflated ego in no small part because of his father. The film covers topics of faith, the fear of failure, the dark side of entertainment, the way class and talents are not in stone and more. It works organically and manages to be incredibly captivating.Forman manages to keep the story entertaining by running his characters through plenty of emotional gamuts. At times the movie is very dramatic. Then there will be incredibly funny moments. Then there will be incredibly thoughtful moments. There is never one monotonous tone and it keeps you on your toes to see how a scene will play out. He also manages to keep an optimistic tone in spite of the darker elements. This is not just a tragic and depressing look at the decline of Mozart's career. It is a celebration of the man and the time period, with all of their faults. We know Mozart's memory still thrives through his music so why just be sad about it.A lot of credit must be given to Tom Hulce as Mozart for that. Portraying Mozart as a boorish delinquent with a brilliant talent is not only pretty accurate (We know these people in real life), but the right counterbalance to the drama. Even as he drifts into insanity and ill health, Mozart is shown as a sympathetic character who has a consistent love for creating great music if not much else.We cannot forget F. Murray Abraham as Antonio Sallieri though. The heart of the movie, Abraham brings emotional weight and human traits to a character who could simply be a typical envious character. his character also has pure intentions for making music, but he never learned how to accept humility for other talented people. Sallieri is a controlled and calculating force of envy and self-loathing and we see it all on Abraham's face and through his line delivery. Also the fact he can effortlessly pull off playing both the young and old Sallieri is an admirable feat.The rest of the supporting cast works excellently in the film, but it is Jeffrey Jones playing Emperor Joseph II that steals the show. Though not nearly in the film enough, he carries a presence both as a royal figure and being a general music illiterate. He also works as a great foil for Hulce's more comedic scenes.There is so much more that can be said about this film. The cinematography is eye popping, the sets are lavishly ornate, the costumes are all precise designed, the editing moves at a comfortable clip, the make-up work is spot-on and the performances of Mozart's classics are first rate.I just could go on, but needless to say I wholeheartedly recommend this film. It is a stunning piece of work and well worth the time of any film buff or Mozart fan!

Upon receiving a distress signal from a cargo freighter, Lieutenant Saavik orders their craft into an area known as the Neutral Zone, whereupon they are attacked and nearly destroyed by a group of Clingon Vessels. It is revealed however that this is all a Training Simulator overseen by Admiral Kirk. Kirk is starting to feel blue as his age is now starting to dictate whether or not he can still command a starship, and this is starting to show on the crew. Meanwhile, the Starship Reliant is on a mission to locate a barren planet upon which they can test 'Genisis', a device that plans to create life on dead worlds by reorganising matter on a molecular level. Commander Chekov and Captain Terral beam down to a barren desert planet with violent storms known as Seti Alpha VI. After coming across a group of Cargo Bays, Chekov is distressed by the sight of the ship's name 'Botany Bay', but before the pair can escape they are captured by a group of men led by the sinister Khan. Khan reveals to them that the planet they are on is Seti Alpha V and that due to the explosion of it's sister planet, the orbit has been knocked irreparably off balance and all that was once luscious has been obliterated. Khan, now feeling betrayed by Kirk for the events that took place 15 years earlier during the original series, plans revenge for the death of his wife. To do this, he places mind controlling bugs into the ears of Chekov and Terral so that they will become his loyal servants. Meanwhile, Kirk and the Crew of the Enterprise prepare to head out on a training mission. However the mission is called off when Kirk's estranged wife, Dr. Marcus, sends him a message saying that the Genisis project is being taken from their test satellite, Regula 1, by the Reliant with no authorisation. The group then make their way to the Satellite but come across the Reliant en route. Unaware that it has been hijacked by the evil Khan and his band of genetically engineered soldiers, Kirk keeps his shields down believing it to be a friendly ship. Now in range, Khan blasts the Enterprise mercilessly with fasers, leaving the vessel short on power. Moments later he reveals himself to Kirk over the Comm Screen, and demands the surrender of the Enterprise and the surrender of all data regarding project Genisis. Kirk uses the time given to gather the data to instead hack into the Reliant's computer and lower their shields so that the Enterprise can retaliate. After receiving several hits from the Enterprise, the Reliant retreats back into space. Repairing what damage they can, Kirk and the Enterprise proceed to Regula 1. What will they find at Regula 1?

My wife and I also have a special affection for this film because it was our dear friend Jake Eberts's first film as Executive Producer. He is not credited on screen because he wanted the Executive Producer credit to go to Dodi Fayed, who put up much of the budget. (He is the same Dodi Fayed who died in the car crash with Princess Diana.) Jake started as a banker and got involved in film finance, leading him to be Executive Producer of 38 important films, only one of those I saw being one which I disliked, namely JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH (1996), which I absolutely hated. Jake's career has been marked by a high moral tone, and a strong streak of idealism. We 'remember him when', i.e. when he was 'just a young banker'. We feel very proud of him. When this film opened, it was unexpected and it burst upon the British public with a wave of enthusiasm and national pride strongly reminiscent of the Olympics which have just ended. The film was brilliantly directed by Hugh Hudson. The modern DVD has unfortunately got extremely faded colour, with browns, reds, and greens predominating. The original print at the time was much more glorious. The DVD also has a big problem with wonky sound balancing, so that music blares and voices fade up and down. You have to watch the DVD with your hand always on the remote, to adjust the sound levels so that you aren't deafened one minute and perplexed by inaudibility the next. The music was composed by Vangelis, and made him famous. That theme was played to exhaustion throughout the recent Olympics, as a recurrent motif. I once knew a beautiful harpist who was taken out by Vangelis in the 1980s, and I asked her how did it go and what was he like. She said he was a strange fellow, that his idea of a date was to drive her round and round London in his elegant Rolls Royce listening to tapes of his music, which she was expected to admire with fervour. This film is an inspiring story of a group of young British runners who want to compete at the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris. In the end, two of them win gold medals, and one wins a silver. But the human dramas of the characters are intense and passionate. The film has that high moral tone which Jake himself has always had, and is a paean to personal achievement and the pursuit of excellence. (This was the basis of ancient Greek civilization, which was based upon 'excellence', which they called aretē. All that is best in Western civilisation comes from this source, though as I am always saying, the traitors within have severed the taproot of our culture to escape their own sense of mediocrity by never having to view anything superior to their own little selves.) Considering the current collapse of the British educational system, which has rotted from within because of the demented educational establishment's hatred of excellence and determination that 'nobody must lose or fail because it will make them feel bad', it is ironical that this film which glorifies the opposite, as the recent Olympics Games also did, carries such resonance for a betrayed public today. The film has not dated at all, except for its faded colour. It is as exciting and vital as it ever was, and indeed it is even more relevant than before, since it reminds us of what we have lost since 1981. If only this film could be shown in every school in Britain, but then, when will pigs fly? All the performances, except perhaps that by Lindsay Anderson as Master of Caius College, Cambridge, in the film are excellent, and the one that shines the most with idealism and vitality is that of Ian Charleson as the Scot, Eric Liddell. It is a great tragedy that such a talented actor died at the young age of 40, in 1990. He is the one everyone always remembers from this film. Possibly the next best job of acting was by Ian Holm as the coach Sam Mussabini. My favourite scene from this film has always been where the young Lord Andrew Lindsay, played by Nigel Havers, is practising his hurdling on the lawn in front of his gigantic country mansion. He has had a row of hurdles set up, and a butler sets a glass full of bubbling champagne on each hurdle. Lindsay then jumps them all without spilling a glass, except that one slightly wobbles. Such a stylish touch! This is a story which exalts heroic struggle for excellence so greatly that any parent should show it to every child on the planet. What a tonic in a declining and decadent world! None of these fine fellows would have dreamt of manipulating the LIBOR rate. What has happened to everybody? Why is everybody now so selfish, greedy, and heedless, when only the other day nobility of character was still admired, and there were still young men like these who strove for it? The film is not only about men and boys, there are women too, and I think Cheryl Campbell deserves a special mention for her convincing performance as a tedious, narrow-minded, but deeply loving sister of Eric Liddell, the Scot who forfeited a medal because he wouldn't run on Sunday. Those were the days when the cinemas were still shut all over Scotland every Sunday because it was the holy day. But today nothing is holy.

A tough-as-nails action epic, this little flick from 1987 added to Schwarzenegger's repertoire as the go-to guy for action flicks at the time and kicked open the door for McTiernan who would go on to direct other classics such as Die Hard, The Hunt for Red October and Last Action Hero (?).A group of mercenaries led by Dutch (Schwarzenegger) are dumped in the Central American jungle on what they believe to be a rescue mission. Almost immediately upon their arrival, it appears something is wrong. Dead bodies -- apparently skinned alive -- are dangling from the trees and all the while, Jesse Ventura won't shut up. It seems there is a much more dangerous enemy lurking in the foliage, one which can mimic its enemies and blend into the scenery much like a chameleon. This enemy is not of this planet, means serious business and is absolutely famished. This, of course, means it's Game on! for Arnold and the Predator.Predator is essentially the perfect action flick. While latter day efforts like Rollerball may indicate otherwise, McTiernan is (or was) a genuine master of his craft. The film is perfectly paced, the effects are solid (if admittedly bit dated by now) and not overpowering and the characters are brought to life by larger than life personalities. Schwarzenegger and Ventura are joined by the likes of Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Sonny Landham and Shane Black. Black, who wrote the script (as well as another action classic from the same year, Lethal Weapon) brings the characters to life with so much testosterone it oozes out of the screen. Not in a gross way, but in the sort of way that makes you feel like you are hanging out with a group of good ol' boys, shooting the breeze and laughing at one inane joke after the other (See, 'cause of the echo...). That is, until carnage ensues and the gang drops off one by one. You'll be laughing one minute and be perched on the edge of your seat the next. Brilliant.While not quite in the same league as, say, Ridley Scott's Alien, Predator delivers the goods in spades. It has a fresh and original concept, a great cast and enough thrills to make it worth watching again and again. McTiernan's Hollywood debut boasts a significant amount of replay value, something which the dreadful Alien Vs. Predator flicks lacked and which most modern films of its ilk lack as well. So grab the DVD\/Blu-Ray\/VHS\/Laserdisc\/Hologram\/Brain-implant, get to da choppah! and get ready for a good time.

James Caan stars as author Paul Sheldon who, while leaving his secluded lodge in Silver Creek gets into a terrible car crash amidst a blizzard. He is saved by Annie Wilkes, a woman who keeps to herself on her quiet farm. There isn't much to Annie other than her eccentric love for Sheldon's Misery book series. She claims to be his number one fan, but as she nurses him back to health she reveals her love of Sheldon's books to be more of an obsession than a liking. Sheldon quickly finds himself in a lot of trouble as his own life is threatened by this deranged fan of his.Misery is an all around wildly entertaining film that incorporates horror, suspense, and even a little bit of dark comedy. These elements work together perfectly and make for an incredibly exciting film full of suspense and lacks any predictability. You never know what is going to happen next while watching Misery, and it makes it incredibly fun to watch. Kathy Bates is astounding as Annie Wilkes, a performance she won an Academy Award for it was so good. The performance is frighteningly believable, absolutely deranged, and makes you so incredibly afraid of what this character is capable of. We don't feel safe at any turn during the film, and it leaves us in constant suspenseful worry about what will happen to Sheldon. James Caan also does an excellent job in his role, but his and all the other roles in the film are heavily overshadowed by Bates.This film has a very natural flow and cadence to it that makes it a wonderfully enthralling experience from start to finish. There's never any dead air, the film always stays interesting, and something new and exciting is always happening. The majority of the film takes place in Annie's house, so there was a lot of opportunity for the film to become redundant and repetitive, but it always maintained a heightened level of excitement. There's never a dull moment in Misery.I personally loved every moment of Misery. I constantly was interested in what would happen next and I couldn't wait to see how the events of the film would all pay off in the end. This is such a well made film and Bates is so terrifyingly good as Annie Wilkes that, if nothing else, her performance will be forever engraved in your brain.

On the surface it seems like a typical superhero story, but underneath there are layers that elevate this film to be something even more.The production value, special effects and makeup work by my favorite makeup artist Rob Bottin are all great and they still look great today because their all practical. There was a huge budget backing this film and they used every cent wisely because a truck load of effort and heart was behind it. Music is great from one of my favorite movie composers the late great Basil Polebouris, that Robo theme is one of my favorite theme songs ever. The action is great it is well choreographed and extremely violent with the gore effects involved, one of my favorite shoot out scenes is the infamous drug warehouse battle it was awesome not just on how many baddies Robo can kill but just seeing Robo use tai chi like movements with his gun against them.The villains are great from Dick Jones played well by Ronny Cox whom is a ruthless CEO that is interested in both making money and becoming the head of OCP not caring how many lives he destroys.However the one villain that really stands out for me is Clarance Bodyger play well by Kurtwood Smith. He is a right hand man for Jones whom also wants to make the big bucks, however he's also a borderline psychopath that just loves to kill cops and innocent people for fun. I also like how he has sort of this dark charisma and sometimes seems to exhibit some sort of anger management issues.And of course the other villain is the ED-209 robot, which is a great design that has been homaged in many other works. But I find the robot both menacing but funny because despite it's capabilities and how big it is, it never works correctly. Let alone like a video game boss is easy to beat once you know it's weaknesses.We see a parallel with Clarance and his criminal organization and OCP, both are businesses and their goal is simply to make money. Like in one scene we hear what Clarance's organization was going to do with the stolen money from the armored truck which was to us it as capital investment just to make more money. Dick Jones in a scene mentions when Delta City is being built illegal gambling, drugs, and prostitution will be on the rise and that would mean more money for both Dick and Clarance.The OCP company alone is interesting, it seems like a company that does great things and could of done even more but the problem is it's their greed, selfishness, and even slightly unrealistic ambitions are what keep them from making a difference.The film deviantly acknowledged the Regan era when capitalism and technology were both on the rise. The future portrayed in this film is very much prolific to what is happening today. This film has mean spirited fun with it's use of humor\/black humor and satire that hits close to home, as it tackles the issues of privatization of services, monopolization, consumerism, and our common addiction to technological progress. To me the funnest moment was in those commercials we saw like that board game Nuke Em I'm still wondering what the rules of that game are. But also the film dealt with a philosophical concepts of identity, humanity and transition.Alex Murphy\/Robocop is played flawless by one of my favorite actors Peter Weller, this is my favorite role from him. He hit the right notes in both emotion and physicality. I really loved how he moved which were sort of miming and tai chi like movements, he was believable as a robot moving at a strange yet natural sort of speed where he was swift but slow at the same time. The capabilities and abilities of Robo are great from his trademark gun twirl I always love, I do that every time I play a light gun video game. Though to me the most impressive was the data probe which gives you the ability to download and upload info on the computer from your brain, almost reminiscent of the sci-fi stories of William Gibson which always had to do with technology and humans trying to integrate together.But most of all I really love the amount of emotion he was able to display making Alex\/Robo and superhero you feel a heavy sense of pathos for. Alex\/Robo is having an identity crisis as memories of his former life download and he is just struggling to make sense as to who he is. Is he a man that was turned into a machine and is just remembering he was once a man; or is he a machine dreaming he was once a man and desires to be one.One scene I always found heartbreaking was when Alex\/Robocop visits his home only to find it empty and the memories of his past flood in, that scene always made me tear up because it really showed two things a life that Alex\/Robo can never go back to and also how being a superhero is never without a price to pay.

If the word overrated was assigned a picture reference in a dictionary, a portrait of AK would probably be the best choice. If the word lemming was assigned a synonym in a thesaurus, the term AK follower would fit the bill nicely. It's no understatement to say that the sheer level of brainless veneration that's repeatedly thrown at this guy hasn't been seen since the advent of organized religion &#x96; especially when one considers the fact that most of his movies suck, yet are somehow able to earn IMDb average ratings over 8.0. These people need to stop beating around the bush and simply construct cathedrals in his honor for daily worship.Well, I knew this day would come. I'm running out of Japanese movies to watch on Netflix, so I have decided to watch more Akira Kurosawa films - despite the fact that much of what I have already seen has been torture to sit through. However, I do typically enjoy films more after a second viewing, so I decided to give Rashomon a second chance. Ironically, I'm going to end up downgrading my original rating from a 4\/10 to a 3\/10. All it did was remind me of why I don't like this director. I truly dread this little project I've started on.Kurosawa directs yet another dud that tells multiple perspectives of a murder. As is the case with many of this director's films, the acting is wretched. Toshiro Mifune (a good actor) gives what is likely the worst performance of his career as he cackles and stumbles around like Jar Jar Binks. Meanwhile, Takashi Shimura (a terrible actor) basically just stares off into space with those bug eyes of his, mugging for the camera with that smug frown that Kurosawa loves so much (go watch Ikiru if you want 2+ hours of Shimura's sad puppy dog glances).

Whereas Raiders seems to have an appeal to a much wider audience, Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom aims squarely at the minds and eyes of those that smile during a massacre.

All credit to the brilliant Spielberg for admitting as much. More than 20 years on we can see Trey Parker and Matt Stone's Team America.

I know Oliver Stone can be a controversial figure but I just think this film ran like a well-oiled machine. It was super-long and yet I didn't feel bored or tired. It sucked me right in. From Robert Richardson's cinematography (which won an Oscar) to the brilliant editing (also won an Oscar) it ran like clockwork. I love the documentary style of filming that Stone employed here. You have clear cinematography interspersed with grainy cinematography, you've got real live footage mixed in with the actors, you've got flashbacks and present day, you've got newspaper clippings and slow-motion shots. Heck, you've got every single film technique employed here and it all works! Plus you've got multiple stories running simultaneously. Love this stuff! You feel like you're right there in the thick of things.Plus this film points out what many people suspected for years and still do - that the JFK assassination was indeed a conspiracy and not the work of some lone gunman. Heck, my parents always maintained it was Krushchev. Others say it was Castro or the mob. Stone (or at least the Jim Garrison character that Costner plays) says it was our own government and the war-profiteering big shots in Washington (perhaps even LBJ himself). JFK was going to end the Vietnam War. So he had to be killed. Same with RFK.

Alexander was crap! But JFK is the first Stone film that I'd say was really very good. I am now looking forward to NIXON with Anthony Hopkins.

Two areas in which I am an absolute expert. Anyone would immediately guess from which director is capable of such a hilarious self-deriding line. Indeed, Woody Allen is a comedic landmark, the best American cinematic exportation to the European market. And this is only justice since the roots of his comedic geniality, besides the Eastern-Jewish humor, two filmmakers complete the European connection Federico Fellini, the visionary and Ingmar Bergman, the introspective. Both Fellini and Bergman drove Allen's own contemplation of the world while Fellini explores the depths of one's inner demons, lusts, and repressed impulses, Bergman elevates them to their world, questioning the place of men within their own condition. Allen never denied these two influences but it was not until the pinnacle of his slapstick career that he made them more obvious.Allen's tendency for homages could be foreseen in Love and Death, a hilarious historical film parodying some iconic shots of Bergman's Persona. Annie Hall and Manhattan intellectualized the relationships between men and women, but it was Interiors that provided the most proper cinematic expression to Allen's torments. The film was a clear homage to Bergman style-wise, but it was saying more about the conflict in Allen's own creative process, as if he was facing a sort of existential block, trivializing the achievements of the past, and questioning the reason-to-be of his work. If not mocking, Allen was questioning his own status as an intellectual clown. He made people laugh, so what? This nothingness might even echo the dichotomy between art and masturbation, as if his oeuvre had no other purpose than satisfying an immediate, egoistical impulse, but leave nothing substantial for posterity.Through Stardust Memories, released in 1980, Woody Allen is still stuck in his middle- career crisis, incapable to consider with objectivity the value of his work. Yet this time, it's not Bergman, it's not the Ego vs. Rest of the World perspective that is underlined, but Ego vs. Subconscious. For such a diagnosis, the themes developed in Stardust Memories mirror Federico Fellini's 8½, the masterpiece chronicling the process of a film-maker's own actions and their incessant interferences with the impulses, grieves, childhood memories and personal fantasies. Both movies are in black and white and the references are obvious, just like Interiors that started with immobile contemplative shots of 'dead' nature; the very opening of Stardust Memories is an immediate reference to Fellini. Woody Allen, playing a fictional alter-ego director, Sandy Bates, stuck in a train full of sad-looking people, can't stand the suffocating atmosphere, forcing him to leave it immediately.However, the comparison with Fellini shouldn't undermine the review but only guide it to a better comprehension of Allen's motives behind the unusual format of Stardust Memories. If one thing, the episodes are not disjointed and the movie is quite easy to follow; in fact, it even suffers from being too explicit at times. In one hilarious scene, Bates implodes all his anger toward an Alien presence, revealing his frustration not to be able to provide something more transcending than humor. I had to watch the Alien scene again, and I was quite satisfied with my previous review of Interiors, which was expressing through a Family crisis, Allen's own fears and dilemmas, and in Stardust Memories, they're just thrown away with words, speeches, rants leaving no room for symbolism and creativity.Fellini created a deliberate confusion from which something genuinely creative graced the silver screen, and left the viewer with an optimistic feeling, a hope in Art, as something that one can only control if he gets himself carried by his emotions and personal sensitivity. In Stardust Memories, Woody Allen doesn't paint a fantasy but take a photograph of his existential crisis. He's a successful comedic director, loved and admired, but the way he depicts his fans and groupies as a bunch of variously pathetic, needy, weird losers says a lot about the vision he has of his own success, something shallow and meaningless. Bates is just a man who pleases the crowd because he incarnates the inner sexiness of an ugly or nerdy man with humor. Allen is known to be a master of self-derision, in Stardust Memories, he sins by being harsher than usual toward himself. Yet Stardust Memories never gets too dark or pessimistic; not only it maintains the comedic tone but keeps us hoping about Allen. If he doesn't admire himself, probably putting himself lower than Fellini or Bergman, he doesn't omit the role of women in his life. Stardust Memories' romantic undertones are essential because they demonstrate that Allen, like every great man, has a woman behind him. He's attracted by the intellectual Jessica Harper, the sweet and maternal Marie-Christine Barrault but can't get off the beautiful and sophisticated Charlotte Rampling, so brilliant she can't find the path of her life in a world full of interrogations. Allen can be a mentor, a baby, or stands on an equal cerebral footing. The harmony he finds in his inspiration relies on his capacity to be that three-dimensional love- wise and therefore incapable to be satisfied. In the same vein than Interiors, Stardust Memories is a pivotal moment in Allen's career, maybe the film didn't meet the success because people expected something exuberant and flamboyant a la Fellini. Ebert thought the film was frustrating because it was a depressing movie about a lack of inspiration. Well, Allen is never as funny as when he's pushing himself down. He's a man of contradictions, wishing he could make people take his humor seriously, but his vision of life is so full of fatalism, of absurdity, of an incapacity to find the right woman, that comedy remains the only proper medium to express his own disillusions. So, paraphrasing a line from Interiors, not only Woody Allen has the anxiety of a true artist, but he also has the talent, and both show in Stardust Memories.

I had to watch the Alien scene again, and I was quite satisfied with my previous review of Interiors, which was expressing through a Family crisis, Allen's own fears and dilemmas, and in Stardust Memories, they're just thrown away with words, speeches, rants leaving no room for symbolism and creativity.Fellini created a deliberate confusion from which something genuinely creative graced the silver screen, and left the viewer with an optimistic feeling, a hope in Art, as something that one can only control if he gets himself carried by his emotions and personal sensitivity. In Stardust Memories, Woody Allen doesn't paint a fantasy but take a photograph of his existential crisis. He's a successful comedic director, loved and admired, but the way he depicts his fans and groupies as a bunch of variously pathetic, needy, weird losers says a lot about the vision he has of his own success, something shallow and meaningless. Bates is just a man who pleases the crowd because he incarnates the inner sexiness of an ugly or nerdy man with humor. Allen is known to be a master of self-derision, in Stardust Memories, he sins by being harsher than usual toward himself. Yet Stardust Memories never gets too dark or pessimistic; not only it maintains the comedic tone but keeps us hoping about Allen. If he doesn't admire himself, probably putting himself lower than Fellini or Bergman, he doesn't omit the role of women in his life. Stardust Memories' romantic undertones are essential because they demonstrate that Allen, like every great man, has a woman behind him. He's attracted by the intellectual Jessica Harper, the sweet and maternal Marie-Christine Barrault but can't get off the beautiful and sophisticated Charlotte Rampling, so brilliant she can't find the path of her life in a world full of interrogations. Allen can be a mentor, a baby, or stands on an equal cerebral footing. The harmony he finds in his inspiration relies on his capacity to be that three-dimensional love- wise and therefore incapable to be satisfied. In the same vein than Interiors, Stardust Memories is a pivotal moment in Allen's career, maybe the film didn't meet the success because people expected something exuberant and flamboyant a la Fellini. Ebert thought the film was frustrating because it was a depressing movie about a lack of inspiration. Well, Allen is never as funny as when he's pushing himself down. He's a man of contradictions, wishing he could make people take his humor seriously, but his vision of life is so full of fatalism, of absurdity, of an incapacity to find the right woman, that comedy remains the only proper medium to express his own disillusions. So, paraphrasing a line from Interiors, not only Woody Allen has the anxiety of a true artist, but he also has the talent, and both show in Stardust Memories.

Two areas in which I am an absolute expert. Anyone would immediately guess from which director is capable of such a hilarious self-deriding line. Indeed, Woody Allen is a comedic landmark, the best American cinematic exportation to the European market. And this is only justice since the roots of his comedic geniality, besides the Eastern-Jewish humor, two filmmakers complete the European connection Federico Fellini, the visionary and Ingmar Bergman, the introspective. Both Fellini and Bergman drove Allen's own contemplation of the world while Fellini explores the depths of one's inner demons, lusts, and repressed impulses, Bergman elevates them to their world, questioning the place of men within their own condition. Allen never denied these two influences but it was not until the pinnacle of his slapstick career that he made them more obvious.Allen's tendency for homages could be foreseen in Love and Death, a hilarious historical film parodying some iconic shots of Bergman's Persona. Annie Hall and Manhattan intellectualized the relationships between men and women, but it was Interiors that provided the most proper cinematic expression to Allen's torments. The film was a clear homage to Bergman style-wise, but it was saying more about the conflict in Allen's own creative process, as if he was facing a sort of existential block, trivializing the achievements of the past, and questioning the reason-to-be of his work. If not mocking, Allen was questioning his own status as an intellectual clown. He made people laugh, so what? This nothingness might even echo the dichotomy between art and masturbation, as if his oeuvre had no other purpose than satisfying an immediate, egoistical impulse, but leave nothing substantial for posterity.Through Stardust Memories, released in 1980, Woody Allen is still stuck in his middle- career crisis, incapable to consider with objectivity the value of his work. Yet this time, it's not Bergman, it's not the Ego vs. Rest of the World perspective that is underlined, but Ego vs. Subconscious. For such a diagnosis, the themes developed in Stardust Memories mirror Federico Fellini's 8½, the masterpiece chronicling the process of a film-maker's own actions and their incessant interferences with the impulses, grieves, childhood memories and personal fantasies. Both movies are in black and white and the references are obvious, just like Interiors that started with immobile contemplative shots of 'dead' nature; the very opening of Stardust Memories is an immediate reference to Fellini. Woody Allen, playing a fictional alter-ego director, Sandy Bates, stuck in a train full of sad-looking people, can't stand the suffocating atmosphere, forcing him to leave it immediately.However, the comparison with Fellini shouldn't undermine the review but only guide it to a better comprehension of Allen's motives behind the unusual format of Stardust Memories. If one thing, the episodes are not disjointed and the movie is quite easy to follow; in fact, it even suffers from being too explicit at times.

It's a really clever and quite quirky story which attempts to bring characters of a different space and time back to the present day, almost like a dream come true for most die hard fans. It also attempts to bring across an environmental message, and they certainly do better than most environmental films as a concept such as this could be quite plausible.The film begins with a strange probe trundling through space, the probe has no distinguishing features apart from the fact that it makes a strange noise. Starfleet notices it's appearance and find's it's course is set for Earth. We then move to Earth where a trial is being held against Admiral Kirk for his actions in the previous film, including the robbery and destruction of the Enterprise. Kirk and his crew have in fact been in exile on Vulcan whilst Spock finishes the final stages of his training and teaching. With the crew now ready, they use the Clingon vessel from before to return to Earth in order for Kirk to stand trial. However, the probe arrives and settles itself above the Earth. Due to an Electromagnetic field being created by the probe, all electrical power is interrupted and violent storms start to rip the world apart. A distress signal is sent to all ships, including Kirk's, stating that they must stay away from Earth. Spock attempts to decipher what language the probe is speaking in and determines it to be the song of the Hump Back Whale, a species which became extinct at the beginning of the 21st Century. Using a special 'Sling Shot' manoeuvre, the crew fires themselves at Warp Speed round the sun in a certain direction and they travel back in time to the year 1985. They then travel to San Francisco where they believe a pair of Hump Back's have been kept in an Aquarium. After attempting to fit-in with the 1985 style (including the use of money), the group travels to find several vital items- Nuclear Coils in order to re-power the ship - A special transparent Aluminium to help contain the Whales and water - A helicopter to carry the Aluminium tank - The Whales themselves!All of these tasks seem to go to plan apart from 2, the acquisition of the Whales, and the collection of the Nuclear Coils. The Whale's Owner, Dr Gillian Taylor, however is reluctant to do so, and Kirk must use his charm on her in order to acquire the vital pieces of equipment necessary to save Earth's future. Can Gillian be swayed to releasing the Whales? Will the others be successful in finding the missing items? Will the Earth of the future be saved? Only within the movie will you find that answer...I can understand that this film is an obvious Enivronmental Film, and a majority of these don't work as they continually cram their messages in your face. But this on the other hand is able to mold it into the Star Trek Universe in a sensible and plausible way. There's a lot more humour in this film compared to the previous two and the acting is a bit more flamboyant. But other than that, this film is really an enjoyable laugh that I'd recommend to anyone!
