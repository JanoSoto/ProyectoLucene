And I can already tell that this is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. It's a well-known film that was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscar Academy-awards, and won the Grand Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1989. But it's not a very long time since I heard about it for the first time, and when I read that Ennio Morricone made the music for the film...that's when it really attracted me.We follow a man by the name of Salvatore through his life, and it begins with his childhood, when he used to spend his time at the local cinema, admiring the projectionist Alfredo. Salvatore's dream was to become a projectionist of his own some day. Later in his teens, we meet his first and biggest love...Elena. This girl was going to change his life...Cinema Paradiso is truly a film to be appreciated by film-lovers like me, and a film that I feel I should have seen a long time ago. It is full of beautiful scenes and moments that I almost can't wait to see again. It never bored me, and the characters went straight into my heart. All of the actors in this film did a very good job, but the ones who caught the most of my attention were Phillipe Noiret in his role as Alfredo and the charming Salvatore Cascio who played Salvatore as a little kid. Giuseppe Tornatore's script and directing were also well done, and it is always a joy to watch pictures from the beautiful country of Italy.Ennio Morricone's score never let me down either, and hit me right from the beginning of. I haven't got the chance to fully see any of Sergio Leone's Spaghetti-Westerns yet, but I have seen Leone's Gangster-Epic Once Upon A Time In America (1984), which is one of my favorite movies. The music Ennio Morricone made for that film is probably the best film-score I've ever heard. In Cinema... he once again makes some beautiful, seductive and unforgettable music, and it really helps to set the mood through out the whole film.What lets me down in this movie, is the last part of it. ***Spoilers Following*** After watching the childhood and teens of Salvatore, the part when he's a grown man comes. He returns to his native village as a successful film-director to take part in Alfredo's funeral, and he is also reunited with Elena. ***End Of Spoilers*** Even though it contains some scenes of good directing and is very interesting to watch, I didn't feel like this part was THAT necessary. And except for a few details, that's the only reason why the film didn't give me the Top Rated Masterpiece feeling. I've read that this part has been cut out in the regular shorter version of the film, so maybe the Director's Cut version wasn't the right one for me. But I'm definitely going to purchase this movie and add it to my DVD-collection, and maybe I'll go for the regular and not the director's version.But no matter which version, Giuseppe Tornatore's Cinema Paradiso is a highly enjoyable film that I know I will be watching many times for the rest of my life. It has numerous of memorable scenes and lines, and the film's theme is to remind us about the appreciation of cinema and film-watching. You'll laugh and you'll cry while watching it, and in the end you'll be thankful that films like this has been made.9.0 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 May 2004","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" A few days ago, I watched the Director's Cut version of the film that the critics have called a gift to the the admirers of movie and cinema for the first time.

While this is going on Graham Hess is continues to struggle with the death of his wife and her last words Tell Merril to swing and Tell Graham to see.I am a keen admirer of Shyamalan's amazing talent to build up an intense atmosphere in his movies, especially The Sixth Sense gives a fantastic view into his perfectionistic feeling for movies. And while this movie is still an admirable effort, it has more flaws than the other Shyamalan movies i have viewed, it's not nearly as thrilling and the awaited twist is a bit sloopy, but the movie is still very intense most of the way. And it does have a lot of Shyamalan's trademarks, i just think that the story itself is not nearly as engaging and interesting as the others, i think Shyamalans twist is also more predictable and expected than in his other movies, there are simply revealed too much for it to really shock. You see some of it coming most of the way, but there are still some things in the end that does indeed make other things in the movie make more sense, but it's nowhere near as powerful and outstanding done as in his earlier movies, but this is still a highly original movie that brings what one expects.I am sure that this is also one of the movies that will divide the general public opinion, the movie can really be understood two ways. Are they all living in some sort of dream? Or is the movie about faith in god and the fact that everything one way or the other, does indeed happen for a reason. I believe in the 2nd. My primary reason for this is that the movie just doesn't make sense if you understand it as a dream, too many things are revealed and too many things wouldn't make sense. If there were only 4 characters in the movie it would make sense, but there are many more, and it would all be too realistic for it all to be a dream. However the 2nd thing is what seems more real, and also what makes most sense, and i have a strong confidence that it is what Shyamalan wanted to say with this movie. Never lose faith, everything does happen for a reason.The directing is definitely strong here, i think Shyamalan have once again proven that he is one of the most talented and interesting new directors, and i do look forward to seeing his new project as i find his style very engaging and interesting. Also i think he has his own style which is good, you can feel that its Shyamalan that have made the movie, and the original feeling he brings adds up for a good experience in watching his movies, he is really good at creating an intense atmosphere in the movie itself, even if it doesn't work out as well here as it have done in his other movies. But who can blame him, Sixth Sense was almost a definition of a perfect thriller.Another thing i have admired Shyamalan for earlier is his apparent skill to make child actors seem so reliable and realistic in their way, a place where many fails because children naturally aren't very experienced and generally also more immature and nervous, but this is the 3rd movie in a row where Shyamalan makes all of his cast play some very convincing roles and there is hardly ever a flaw here. Especially Joaquin Phoneis is fantastic, and i will always have the image of him with the helmet on burnt inside my eyes.To sum it all up a bit, i am as said a big admirer and fan of Shyamalans special style, for me he is one of the best directors i have seen since Carpenters early days in building up an intense atmosphere, and even though this movie doesn't come close to the perfection of The Sixth Sense, it's still a solid and thrilling movie that will surprise you, even if you think you have the ending predicted. 7\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"14 May 2004","score":"","review":"  SignsGraham Hess is a former priest, who has lost all his faith in god when his wife died.

I think he liked this film for Julia, and his eyes jumped right out of his head.  Julia did herself up for the male auidence; I wanted to go see Krate dude out for revenge 3 or some other mind numbing action film and old Dave or I guess back then new Dave wanted to see Julia.   I wish he ment her instead of well lets not go there; the acting is fine.  Richard and Roberts I never seen them act bad even with a bad story.  The story need something more to it like the Pizza movie Roberts was in before.  Acted well, just something missing in the story's execution.  The theme where people have hope, and can change is great, but the execution for the conclusion need's some juice. 5 out of 10.  Richard and Roberts should do more movie together there is a chemistry between them.  One can not help but see this in this film. Something tells me these actors are all right people.  I bet Julia, Richards and myself would argue on many issues, but their on screen warmth seem to be real.  I give credit for Julia's donation of money for 9\/11 her tears where real.

While I admit he has produced both classics (in artistic terms) and blockbusters (in commercial terms) is he really that good? Is he really able to rise above the budget, acting, technology or script? Does he believe in anything? Have a grand message for the world other than it is good to be rich and famous? A nice guy, sure, but so is my milkman.Call me a hard man to please, but I don't believe that Spielberg has put anything really new in the cinema pot and he has dipped in and borrowed plenty Hitchcock, Scorsese, Kubrick and Kazan have all produced mini-masterpieces from nowhere with no stars or budget to speak of. Spielberg hasn't (although Juggernaut was above average for a TV movie).As has been said a thousand times before, the opening takes a first hand look at D-day and is quite brilliant, but when it ends the movie droops. It is then a bog-standard war-is-hell product with a lot of extra emoting and men-can-cry to show that we have turned the page. (Actually we haven't - many European films and B's have explored war from a first hand and more down-and-gritty viewpoint, but the mass audience haven't actually seen those products so they just think they are getting something new.)Tom Hanks is a great actor. He is the first and only modern star to play weak (or even stupid) and improve his box office standing. I praise him for it. No one could be better than him here, really bang on the money. But no one else needs to do much other than mouth words and Ryan (despite being the title role) is a star walk-on. I am glad I saw this film and I recommend it to you. But I wouldn't want to see it again no matter own it. Money has been well spent and its heart is in the right place, but at the end it wants to get you in a headlock and push emotions down your throat.

Dave's eyes popped out at Julia, I guess they dressed her up for the male audience; Myself wanted to see Karate Dude revenge or some other mind numbing movie.  I found the acting done well, Gere and Roberts have never acted bad in a film I have seen.  They have a chemistry together and should do more films.  Gere ages well like a wine.  Roberts sometimes, she is a real love her or hate  type of actress. She surprises me by doing some great movies.  I probably disagree with Gere and Roberts on many issues, but the warmth they show on screen I do believe is real.  Not many people would cry and donate the money Julia did for 9\/11.

After the Dollar trilogy director Sergio Leone wanted to move on to other things, but the studios urged him to make one more of his excellent spahgetti westerns.  This film is the result of that.The plot circles on the four main characters Jill (Claudia Cardinale), a beautiful woman who's new family was just shot down; Frank (Henry Fonda), the evil gunslinger who shot them; Cheyenne (Jason Robards), the bandit accused of the slaughter and Harmonica (Charles Bronson), a mysterious gunslinger tracking Frank for unknown reasons.  The four characters start off by themselves, but as the story progresses they meet each other - under circumstances bad and good - and confront each other, all in Leone's excellent Spahgetti Western style.Though I did like For a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly just a little more than this, Once Upon a Time in the West has an equal amount of style and substance.  Jill is, in nature, a tramp, and we get to see her develop throughout the film.  Harmonica doesn't have much developement, but he still leaves us with a lasting impression (and it is Bronson's best performance).  Fonda does evil very well, he is scary and intimidating here.  Robards delivers the film's best performance, as his characters takes an unexpected, dramatic turn near the end.  Jason Robards was a terrific actor, may he rest in peace.And then there is the style too, of course.  The opening credits last ten minutes into the movie, ten quiet minutes of three guys quietly waiting at a train station, with sounds like a fly and a drip of water the only noise (brilliant beginning).  This is not Morricone's best score, but it's not bad either, and it captures the moments just like his scores in the other Spahgetti Westerns.One of the greatest Westerns of all time, and a lot of fun, 8.5\/10.
