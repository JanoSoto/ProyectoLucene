Like Orwell's book we live in a world where our movements are continually being monitored, where a minority of people control the flow of information and where people worship, suffer and die for the benefit of imaginary figures and callous tyrants. Just take North Korea, or religious fundamentalists, or Guantanamo Bay. They're all Orwellian examples.Therefore Orwell's book is timeless. It might have Nineteen Eighty-Four on the cover, but there are always going to people who want to destroy civil liberties, eliminate freedom of thought and enforce crackpot ideologies. But although the book will always be relevant, it does very much have a post-Second World War feel to it &#150; it's both timeless and of it's time. So it was an excellent idea on part of the filmmakers to envisage the landscape of the film as one that was already dated. Now that may sound stupid, but nothing dates quicker than a science-fiction landscape that has gone out of fashion, so to film Orwell's book as if it's happening just after the Second World War grounds it in a stark reality that you can believe in. It's a Britain that could have been.One of the best ways in which this bleak world is visualised is through the photography. It's dirty, it's grimy and it's washed out. It lends the film a depressing drabness that communicates how crippling and soul-destroying such a world would be. I also like the way the propaganda films are shot &#150; they're sepia in colour and again they look like something out of the Second World War. Then you have the costumes &#150; everyone wears boiler suits. It's a world where everyone looks the same.They're also forced to think the same. The scenes where large groups of people shout at enemies and then praise the almighty Big Brother make me think of religious fanatics. After all, Big Brother is really god. He may have a human face and the Party in the book and the film might be non-religious, but all repressive ideologies are the same. They require blind devotion, loyal servitude and the willing relinquishment of personal freedom. The only difference with religion is that instead of worshipping a man you're worshipping a man sitting on a cloud.Therefore, Winston's actions are heroic. All the time he's fighting the system. At the beginning it's just through not shouting as vigorously at the propaganda drivel as the sheep that surround him, but then it's through the journal he keeps and the love affair that he has. And although they're really small acts of dissent, because of the restrictions placed upon him they add up to a lot.But it's the affair with Julia that is most important. All through the film there are scenes where people denounce the family &#150; it prevents people from being loyal to the Party &#150; and where people say that Party scientists are working at a way to eliminate the orgasm &#150; pregnancies will be the result of artificial insemination. So that two people would connect and take pleasure in something that is entirely personal, is the biggest 'screw you' that you could give the Party. It's an expression of freedom, and one that, in the context, is remarkably heroic.But of course, it's inevitable that the two get caught &#150; they actually know themselves that they'll get caught one day, which makes their actions even more courageous. And it's the scenes with O'Brien, brilliantly played by Richard Burton, that I like the most. They're chilling in how unreasonably reasonable he is. He's kind of like a kindly uncle that is absolutely crazy but who can express himself much better than you and who is going to torture you until you come around to his own twisted logic. You know that Winston is right (John Hurt, too, is magnificent; perfect casting) but O'Brien is just more convincing. He speaks like he has the answers to everything, which indeed he does (even though they're wrong). And so the crushing of Winston's spirit and his resolve is unspeakably brutal. If indeed Winston is the last man, then there's no hope for sanity and freedom.I should also mention the Room 101 scene. It actually improves slightly on the book. O'Brien's dialogue is changed a little bit to make the rats seem like more of a threat &#150; Sometimes they go straight for the eyes, other times they burrow through the cheeks and devour the tongue. It helps just in case you think they're cute and cuddly.But, of course, the scene is also important because it's the scene where Winston's spirit is finally crushed. Up until that point, despite the torture and his submission to O'Brien, he hadn't betrayed Julia (emotionally at least) and accepted Big Brother. But confronted by his greatest fear, he's finally turned against her and comes to love Big Brother. Again it makes me think of religion. A lot of religious people don't love god because they see him as wise and benevolent, they love him because they fear what he'll do to them if he doubts their faith or if they worship him in the wrong way. The love is governed by fear.The final scenes are well filmed but they're not quite as powerful as those in the book. In the book, after the torture, Winston and Julia meet in a park and then after a banal conversation she leaves to join the crowd. In the film it's transposed to a caf√©. It's still an excellent scene, but it's not quite as powerful symbolically.But regardless, the film is an excellent adaptation of Orwell's book. I honestly can't imagine it being done any better.

Not since The Running Man have I seen a book butchered so far beyond recognition. The difference, however, is that The Running Man film was still enjoyable as an amusing action film laden down a million catch phrases. This film&#133; Nope, nothing remotely amusing. In fact, if you love the book, as I do, you'll hate this bastardization even more.**WARNING**CONTAINS SPOILERS** Rightio, I'm basically going to tell you the story here, almost in it's entirety. Why? Because you, dear reader, do not also need to suffer through this abomination&#151;it's okay for me, because I enjoy watching crap. Because I like complaining about sh*tty things. Now, on to the nasty This film revolves around a boy and his mother running away from the government and a mutant-monkey-creature-soldier which escaped from a destroyed Government genetics lab with a super-smart golden retriever which the hero calls Furface. Groan&#133; Trust me, in the novel, this story rocked. I'll get to that later. Anyway, the hero is none other that dreamy boy-child Corey Haim. Oh, I'm not kidding. Our hero runs around, crackly voice and all, trying to convince his Mom to help save this dog from the evil government which birthed him and made him genetically ultra-smart. The monkey-creature, retardedly referred to as an Oxcom (God help us) is also a genetic-stew of a creature built to be the ultimate fighter on battlefields of the future. Michael Ironside (Total Recall, Starship Troopers&#151;always plays a badass) is also in this film, and no, I couldn't figure out how anyone convinced him this would be a good idea. He plays a government agent with the NSO hunting the dog and creature. Oh yeah, here's some spoilerama He's also a creation from the government, and the same lab, and lo and behold spends most of the movie being a prick and killing people&#151;and all that killing is supposed to be done by the monkey-soldier. Instead of a rockin' kick-ass, creepy horror film, we have a rectal hemorrhage of a teenybopper horror flick. The dog's intelligence is discovered all-too-conveniently, and believed easier than we believe we can see clouds by looking outside. Breakdown!!Change from Book to Film--Lead character (Travis) turned from man to boy-child.--Man's love interest in book (Nora), is now his mother&#151;and all her depth and character growth is completely gone.--Lem Johnson, black man, is now white Mr. Ironside. This matters as the character's strength was built on his heritage in the book.--Relationship between two authority figures completely ignored, Lem now kills the guy who was originally his best friend.--One principle character in the book is now totally absent, the immortal that hunted the heroes--maybe this is supposed to be Ironside, but then why is he someone else?--Dog never receives deserving name of Einstein in the movie.--No part of the book took place in a High School&#151;at least nothing that had strong bearing on the plot.--Takes place over a matter of days, rather months like the book&#151;unrealistic pacing.--Corey Haim's girlfriend in the movie appeared in no more than two chapters in the book--and they never met in the book.--Character of Lem Johnson is no longer cool-headed; instead, he's a total asshole that bullies his way through people.--Hero Travis was part of Delta Force (military segment specializing in hunting terrorists), instead, his Dad, who is never seen in the film, was part of that group.--Perceived intelligence in the monster now totally absent.--Subplots involving Soviets and The Mob completely gutted out of the story.--These are just the most obnoxious changes, and the one's I could remember off hand (and a day later).The Good--Eventually, after 90-odd minutes of pain and mental anguish, the movie ended.Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help It--Michael Ironside&#151;usually, I like him.--The dog is still fairly likable.--Wacky totally 80's title screen.The Bad--Okay, the writing for one is extremely awful.--The direction is so half-assed that anyone watching the film will feel superior to everyone involved in it.--The acting is crappy and weak, especially from Corey Haim.--Loose, weak, watered down story.--The monster looks just pathetic, that is, when we are actually allowed to see the bloody thing.

Geez. If you want to survive a horror film, it doesn't pay to be black or British&#133;or even worse, a black Brit). Also stolen from Aliens is the evil corporate guy. This bloke's another half-wit.

The CGI is of the same standard as Anaconda and the badly designed tentacles (twenty sets of teeth and overlapping mouths equal overkill, not terror) inspire about as much fear as a mute shouting 'Boo!'Anaconda, though. There's another film where parallels can be drawn. In both films there's a scene where a half-digested person is released from the belly of a beast. But while both scenes in both films are stupid, Anaconda wins because Jon Voight winks. (There's a fine line between amusingly stupid and just stupid.) Other stupid stuff include an Asian woman who can't act, an Australian who gets killed after going off on his own, a big monster that is a blatant rip-off of the Queen in Aliens, a jet ski escape that coincides with a huge explosion, massive guns that look like they've been designed by a visually impaired five-year old and scene after scene of people arguing with one another for no logical purpose other than to build up some half-assed idea of tension.

I agree with much of what has been written. The movie is gripping, brilliantly conceived and nearly flawlessly executed. It is a movie which I can watch a couple of times a year and get inspiration from.As a lifetime track & field competitor, and currently a 'masters' decathlon competitor, I was fascinated by the historical accuracy of the movie. The movie industry virtually always makes changes for dramatic effect. The Buddy Holly Story - another one of my favorites - is filled with them, though they don't really spoil the positive effect of paying a tribute to his music.In this case, as another reviewer has mentioned, the inaccuracies don't detract too much. However they are worth recounting. These are the ones I am aware of.First, the characters of Lindsay and Montague - two compelling figures in the movie - appear to be entirely fictitious. The movie shows Lindsay getting a silver medal in the 400M intermediate hurdles, then gallantly stepping aside to let Eric Liddell run the 400M. No British runner won a medal in the 400 meter hurdles. In addition, the 100 meters is traditionally one of the first track & field finals in the Olympics. am not sure about this, but my guess is that this was true in 1924 as well, meaning that the 400 meter hurdles would have been later in the meet. My suspicion is that the reason for Montague and Lindsay appearing live in the opening scene at the church is so they don't have to account for their life stories in the closing tableau, which mentions the fate of both Abraham and Liddell.Second, as others noted, Liddell knew months in advance of the Sunday 100M heats. He did forgo the race for the reasons mentioned and it did cause a furor in England. But the whole aspect of the pressured meeting in Paris was totally fictitious. Something NOT noted in the movie - and in my mind an amazing aspect of Liddell's accomplishment - is that he not only won the 400M by 5 yards - a race not his specialty - but also set a world record of 47.4 in the process. I don't know why this wasn't somehow worked into the movie - it would have made it more powerful than it already is, inmy opinion. Third, the entire Abraham v. Liddell rivalry is likely exaggerated, at the least. There is NO record of their ever competing against each other before the Olympics - as was portrayed in the movie - with the scene of Harold being comforted by his girlfriend-someday-to-be-wife in the stands afterwards.Fourth, the movie gives the impression that Liddell and Abrahams never squared off in the Olympics, leaving unsettled who was the better runner. In fact they both entered the 200 meters, with Liddell finishing 6th and Abrahams not making the final. Takes a little of the gloss off the accomplishments, which is why it was probably not mentioned.Fifth, no mention is made of the fact that Abrahams had actually competed in the 1920 Olympics - in multiple events - not placing in any of them. The scene where Sam Mussabini is schooling Abraham about the 1920 Olympics makes no sense - Abraham was at that Olympics - he just didn't place. Sixth, the movie shows Abraham losing out to Jackson Schultz in the semi-final of the 100 meters, by looking to the side. Abrahams actually dominated the 100 meter event - in the heats, quarterfinals and semifinals before winning the final. In fact, it was theorized that he might have expended himself unnecessarily out of anxiety and insecurity, risking losing the finals. But he also won the final, though not by a large margin. Seventh, and I am not sure about this - the 200 meters is usually AFTEr the 100 meters, so Abrahams comment to Sam Mussabini about losing in the 200 meters would have been fictitious.Eighth, Jackson Schultz has said he never gave Liddell a note about honoring God. In fact, it is hard for me to imagine that an athlete not in an event would have access to runners before an event final like that. This also applies to the scene where the British High Command are meeting the 100 meter finalists right before their race - no way that would have ever happened. That having been said, the movie was still phenomenal - and I love it and always will. The soundtrack alone qualifies it for a special place in movie history.Some other points of interest. Sam Mussabini was a very real character, and he was hired by Abraham as a professional. The race in which Liddell fell and got up and won is also based on a true event.I hope my breakdown of these points is not mis-interpreted.

I agree with much of what has been written. The movie is gripping, brilliantly conceived and nearly flawlessly executed. It is a movie which I can watch a couple of times a year and get inspiration from.As a lifetime track & field competitor, and currently a 'masters' decathlon competitor, I was fascinated by the historical accuracy of the movie. The movie industry virtually always makes changes for dramatic effect. The Buddy Holly Story - another one of my favorites - is filled with them, though they don't really spoil the positive effect of paying a tribute to his music.In this case, as another reviewer has mentioned, the inaccuracies don't detract too much. However they are worth recounting. These are the ones I am aware of.First, the characters of Lindsay and Montague - two compelling figures in the movie - appear to be entirely fictitious. The movie shows Lindsay getting a silver medal in the 400M intermediate hurdles, then gallantly stepping aside to let Eric Liddell run the 400M. No British runner won a medal in the 400 meter hurdles. In addition, the 100 meters is traditionally one of the first track & field finals in the Olympics. am not sure about this, but my guess is that this was true in 1924 as well, meaning that the 400 meter hurdles would have been later in the meet. My suspicion is that the reason for Montague and Lindsay appearing live in the opening scene at the church is so they don't have to account for their life stories in the closing tableau, which mentions the fate of both Abraham and Liddell.Second, as others noted, Liddell knew months in advance of the Sunday 100M heats. He did forgo the race for the reasons mentioned and it did cause a furor in England. But the whole aspect of the pressured meeting in Paris was totally fictitious. Something NOT noted in the movie - and in my mind an amazing aspect of Liddell's accomplishment - is that he not only won the 400M by 5 yards - a race not his specialty - but also set a world record of 47.4 in the process. I don't know why this wasn't somehow worked into the movie - it would have made it more powerful than it already is, inmy opinion. Third, the entire Abraham v. Liddell rivalry is likely exaggerated, at the least. There is NO record of their ever competing against each other before the Olympics - as was portrayed in the movie - with the scene of Harold being comforted by his girlfriend-someday-to-be-wife in the stands afterwards.Fourth, the movie gives the impression that Liddell and Abrahams never squared off in the Olympics, leaving unsettled who was the better runner. In fact they both entered the 200 meters, with Liddell finishing 6th and Abrahams not making the final. Takes a little of the gloss off the accomplishments, which is why it was probably not mentioned.Fifth, no mention is made of the fact that Abrahams had actually competed in the 1920 Olympics - in multiple events - not placing in any of them. The scene where Sam Mussabini is schooling Abraham about the 1920 Olympics makes no sense - Abraham was at that Olympics - he just didn't place.

Third-billed, and even with added Garbo scenes to keep Crawford from walking off with Grand Hotel, she still does.Crawford and Lionel Barrymore not only make their clich√©d lines and characters wholly believable, they literally walk off into the sunrise together at the end, as clich√©s often do.Wallace Beery is wonderful and dimensional and even heart-breaking as Preysing.

John Barrymore, next, does the best he can playing a Baron who wears more eye shadow than Garbo. Oh, wait Barrymore ALWAYS wore more eye shadow than his leading ladies. Whether a carryover from his theatrical makeups during his stage career, or a misguided attempt to give his puffy alcoholic's face some screen definition, it's hard to say. What's easy to say is that he's occasionally effective here, and affecting; but mostly self-conscious. Why is that man wearing all that eye-shadow? leads to an awareness that one can almost count, beat by beat, his stagy timing of even so simple a gesture as gently chucking Crawford's chin, or his vain attempt to make a mediocre script sound like iambic pentameter.

But please, out of courtesy to her talent and legend, don't compare her performance here with any of her others (Camille, say, or Ninotchka or Anna Karenina). Director Goulding allowed her favorite mannerisms to get the best of her the constantly dancing eyebrows in closeups, the tilt-back of the head to gaze soulfully at ceilings (were cue-cards pasted up there?).Lewis Stone gets nothing to do but embody a one-man Greek Chorus, over and over, about (to paraphrase) People come and go.

Do you ever feel like that? Do you ever feel bored with life? Frustrated with your job and the people around you? Do you ever feel like you've wasted your precious time on this Earth? Do you ever feel like you can't feel at all? Well, Fight Club is the movie for you.Many (who haven't seen the film) seem to be under the impression that Fight Club is a big, dumb, brutish, excessively violent guy movie about some kind of brutal kick-boxing club. This couldn't be further from the truth.Here's the real plot Our unnamed protagonist and narrator (Norton) is a man who hates his job and everything around him (Sound familiar?). He has a crippling case of insomnia which he can't seem to cure. He is a zero in a vast sea of electronic digits. Then he meets the enigmatic Tyler Durden (Pitt), a hip, confident funk song of a man; in other words everything our narrator isn't. After a rather unfortunate event, he comes to live with Durden, and the two inadvertently become the founders of a club for disaffected men to take out their frustrations on each other. But eventually, Durden injects his own twisted ideals into fight club and it becomes something much larger and important. It also becomes a nightmare for our protagonist. By the way, wondering why the narrator goes unnamed through the entire film? My guess would be to stress the impersonality of the modern age.At first glance, it may seem like these men hurt each other because they are nothing but raging piles testosterone with nothing better to do. While this may play a minor role in their actions, the main reason they fight is because they are victims. Victims of the age of computers, credit cards, and Starbucks. They fight because they feel nothing and they want, long, and need to feel something, anything. They relish inflicting pain. They relish receiving pain. They relish the fact that they can feel. But don't be fooled and think that this is a depressing, unrelentingly serious film about deprived individuals; Fight Club is as much a comedy as a drama or a thriller. I actually found myself raucously guffawing on more than several occasions throughout the 2+ hour running time.The film is beautifully photographed and masterfully directed by David Fincher, who drenches the film in his wonderfully original and fantastically stylish approach, but the style is not a gimmick to cover up a shoddy film; it works. It works perfectly. Fincher has always had a strong visual flair, and Fight Club may be his most aesthetically interesting film yet. The film also features some fantastic acting, principally from Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. Norton gives a dead-on performance as the frustrated every-man, and Pitt gives a very spirited performance as Durden, who may just be the biggest celluloid badass since Clint Eastwood's The Man With No Name. Helena Bonham Carter is also notable as the only prominent female character in the film.Another strong contributing element of the movie is the fun soundtrack. The film's instrumental hip-hop\/techno score, courtesy of The Dust Brothers, really enhances the experience; I can't imagine the movie without it. And as a personal plus, the film uses two of my favorite songs of all time Goin' Out West by Tom Waits and Where Is My Mind? by Pixies (which are both utilized perfectly).But what is probably the most fascinating aspect of Fight Club is the way it dissects the psyche of a mentally unsound individual. But you will know what I'm talking about when you see the movie, I won't spoil it for you.Also, don't be fooled by the critics who condemn the film for being overly violent and graphic. I quite simply do not understand this claim. There are a few brutal fight scenes and maybe two gun-wounds. It is not excessive or graphic. It is necessary to the plot.Fight Club is not about action. Fight Club is not about convention. Fight Club is not about brutality. Fight Club is about the adverse effects of our modern dystopia. Fight Club is about enlightenment.

It works perfectly. Fincher has always had a strong visual flair, and Fight Club may be his most aesthetically interesting film yet. The film also features some fantastic acting, principally from Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. Norton gives a dead-on performance as the frustrated every-man, and Pitt gives a very spirited performance as Durden, who may just be the biggest celluloid badass since Clint Eastwood's The Man With No Name. Helena Bonham Carter is also notable as the only prominent female character in the film.Another strong contributing element of the movie is the fun soundtrack. The film's instrumental hip-hop\/techno score, courtesy of The Dust Brothers, really enhances the experience; I can't imagine the movie without it. And as a personal plus, the film uses two of my favorite songs of all time Goin' Out West by Tom Waits and Where Is My Mind? by Pixies (which are both utilized perfectly).But what is probably the most fascinating aspect of Fight Club is the way it dissects the psyche of a mentally unsound individual. But you will know what I'm talking about when you see the movie, I won't spoil it for you.Also, don't be fooled by the critics who condemn the film for being overly violent and graphic. I quite simply do not understand this claim. There are a few brutal fight scenes and maybe two gun-wounds. It is not excessive or graphic. It is necessary to the plot.Fight Club is not about action. Fight Club is not about convention. Fight Club is not about brutality. Fight Club is about the adverse effects of our modern dystopia. Fight Club is about enlightenment. But most importantly, Fight Club is about rebellious, impeccable, and thoroughly entertaining film-making. Fight Club is a modern masterpiece.9.5\/10 ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"27 September 2005","score":"6 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" After having heard and read about this movie for years, I finally got the chance to see it on TCM this weekend, during the month-long Michael Powell tribute. I was really looking forward to seeing it, but I have to say that I was a little disappointed. Compared to Black Narcissus and The Red Shoes - both amazing films - Peeping Tom seemed a big step down. I was left with the impression that the critics were probably right, in that it was not a very good movie. Had it been better paced and better written, it might have made a much better impression on critics at the time, but as it is, it just sort of came across as a rather dull and poorly done version of the sort of thing that British television specialized in at the time (The Saint, The Avengers, Thriller, etc.), only more lurid. Carl Boehm was miscast, and the scene with Moira Shearer seemed to go on for far too long, and its only purpose seemed to be to show off her dancing. I would have preferred having her play a larger role. The detective element of the film was weak at best. The notion of Mark Lewis moonlighting as a porn photographer was interesting, and I would have liked to have seen that explored a little more. It just seemed like the film was made up of a whole bunch of loose ends that were never tied up. The brightest spot was the casting of Anna Massey as Lewis' girlfriend. She brought an honesty to the role, and her plain looks brought a certain beauty to the part that a more traditionally glamorous actress might have spoiled.Overall, not a bad movie but not a great one either, and Michael Powell didn't deserve to have his career ruined over it.

And, as many of us undergrounders know, one doesn't get much more bizarre than David Cronenberg or David Lynch. So, after viewing Lynch's Lost Highway and Blue Velvet it became a goal of sorts for me to locate and view Eraserhead, generally considered his first feature-length motion picture. Firstly, you really have to like this kind of off-the-wall strange kind of sh*t to appreciate a film like this. The story revolves around Henry (Eraserhead, we can assume), his girlfriend\/wife, their baby and his life in what would appear to be some sort of ghetto apartment building. Really, what we have here is a lunatic montage of images and scenes that do a wonderful job of twisting viewers' faces into various shocked grimaces and exasperations. It's a beautiful cinematic piece just to watch, even without trying to figure out what the hell is happening. The imagery is eye-catching, shocking, and insane&#151;and despite the relatively slow pace of the film, it does a fantastic job of holding attention through the unusual visuals. Here's my standard breakdownThe Good--The cinematography is outstanding, as is the atmosphere and sound.--It has a feeling of a film from the 40's or 50's because of the extremely dark style of black and white photography, and the film grain (keep in mind that some of this grain could be related to the old video on which I viewed this psychotic montage).--Excellent lighting.--Lynch's direction, of course, perfectly holds the insanity together.--The special effects and shock value of the film still holds up extremely well, even after nearly 30 years.Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help It--The acting is pretty good.The Bad--The style of the film and its lunatic-artsy style will be a turn-off for a lot of people, as will the extremely dark atmosphere and slow pace. But those are also the qualities that would be appreciated by fans of this kind of film, so there's kind of a catch-22 here.The Ugly--Seeing the baby all sick and covered with sores.Memorable Scene--Too many to mention, but I'm going to go with a scene near the beginning when Henry has dinner with his girlfriend's family and he is asked to carve up the chickens.Acting 8\/10 Story 9\/10 Atmosphere 10\/10 Cinematography 10\/10 Character Development 7\/10 Special Effects\/Make-up 7\/10 Nudity\/Sexuality 2\/10 Violence\/Gore 6\/10 (there wasn't much, but it was good) Music 9\/10 Direction 9\/10Cheesiness 1\/10 Crappiness 0\/10Overall 9\/10Definitely not for everyone, mostly for genre-fans and cultist movie-goers.

I disliked his two films centered around THE MUMMY and there's no way I'll be paying money to watch VAN HELSING or any other future Sommers project . As it stands DEEP RISING is the zenith of Sommers career and is probably the only film by this director that's worth going out of your way to see To give some credit to Sommers a story featuring desperate modern day pirates and other dodgy characters as protagonists should be something of a turn off and while they're not exactly contenders for a UN humanitarian award the audience do feel some empathy for these dubious people . The story itself featuring men with guns getting stalked by unseen assailiants is very old fashioned but I have to confess I've always enjoyed these sort of sci-fi horror action adventures . Sommers rightly leaves the audience in the dark as to what these monsters are and they're not revealed until quite late into the story Unfortunately when the monsters are revealed it's obvious that they were created via a CGI process . This is what I have always disliked about Sommers work - The CGI is relatively poor because it looks like computer generated animation , the monsters never look like they exist in reality , only as a special effect added in post production . But again since the monsters have been kept back until relatively late in the narrative this doesn't undermine the film unlike THE MUMMY RETURNS which is one poor CGI effect after another DEEP RISING is very much a traditional horror movie . It's not ambitious or original and shows signs of what's wrong with this director's latter work but it is very entertaining in parts .
