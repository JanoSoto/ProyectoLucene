I had seen it years before but I rediscovered it recently one boring day after class. After scanning my family's DVD collection, I picked this out because I has seen all my other movies too many times. And I was blown away the second time.Vanilla Sky features Tom Cruise, makes you think, but leaves no questions unanswered, which is why it is hated so much. But I say that not every movie has to be mindless action or else utterly confusing from start to finish (although I do appreciate those from time to time). Of the all people I've met who have hated it, the most valid criticism I've heard is It's weird. The fact remains that there is nothing wrong with this movie. Some movies with the most boring plots win awards thanks to superb direction, great dialogue and good acting. Vanilla Sky has all these thing and a great story line. Vanilla Sky will draw you in. And the soundtrack is amazing.A word of advice though Do not watch this movie in a giddy mood with friends. Watch it by yourself, or with someone who has similar movie taste as you. Or watch under the same circumstance as me boredom. Just be ready to appreciate it's greatness. I promise you won't be disappointed.

Personally, pretty much anything he does makes me laugh so it came as no surprise that I enjoyed UHF. What was surprising was just how much I enjoyed it and how much I immediately wished that more people knew about it. It holds up as a hilarious comedy.The thin story sees Al playing George Newman, a daydreamer never in any one job for too long who's about to lose his girl. It looks like this could all change when an uncle gives him a small public TV station he won in a bet and, after a rocky start, the ratings start climbing higher and higher, thanks in no small part to a janitor named Stanley Spadowski (Michael Richards) who becomes a hit with audiences when he gets a chance to host his own TV show. There's a big, nasty, rival TV station (with the great Kevin McCarthy in charge) and a rush to make money during the last half hour but it's all really just an excuse for a load of great gags and fun parodies.This is not a movie to watch if you love nothing but classics of cinema. It's a movie to watch if you like 'Weird Al', enjoy seeing Michael Richards do his jittery, manchild act and can have fun with Indiana Jones parodies and adverts for Spatula City. There's also a gag here that may very well be the funniest dumb gag I have ever seen on screen, it had me crying with laughter for a good few minutes afterwards.Nobody in the cast is all that great (with the exception of Richards and McCarthy) but they all do what has to be done to move things along in between the moments of hilarity. Director Jay Levey does enough to keep things looking decent but, again, this is all really just about the gags and everything is done to serve the material, making it all work brilliantly.

Port Moresby? The writer of the novel, Paul Bowles, surely meant it as a joke but although I get the joke I didn't get the point.In fact, the point of the entire film was pretty much lost on me. Winger and Malkovitch arrive to do some touring in North Africa. Come wiz me to zah Casbar. And tell us where Rick's Cafe is located. Right. There is a hanger-on whom they've met on their journey, Scott Campbell. The trio do their best to make themselves at home in the strange city full of strange streets. They stay in a crummy hotel. They wander about and drink tea. No booze in Islamic countries, though my informants asseverate that there is usually some dynamite hash to be had.But if the point of the story is that Kit and Port feel their marriage dissolving, and that they're searching for something that will restore meaning to their bond, there's not much evidence of it. Yes, Port sleeps with a seductive and treacherous hooker. And Winger and Scott spend the night together after a debauch. But there's nothing to indicate that these were more than errant acts based on impulse, nothing resembling a recurring pattern. Kit and Port don't fight; they hardly argue. They may not be especially bright but they're not soulless either.They leave the city and travel to a smaller and shabbier tourist town. They manage to dump Scott somewhere. Then they board an overcrowded third-world bus and wind up with Port dying of some unidentified disease, a victim of the epidemic that has caused the closing of the only respectable hotel in town.She leaves his body on the floor mattress and wanders off into the desert's fringe, where she is offered a ride by some spooky looking nomads, who turn out to be reasonably human after all. They take her to a village compound made up of some unworldly looking multi-story adobe structures. Winger stays with the young head honcho for a while, getting to know him in a Biblical sense, until the other ladies begin to resent her presence and throw her out. She winds up at a Western outpost, tattooed but saved.Bowles, the author, makes small appearances at the beginning and the end of Winger's journey, voicing some pieces of narrative from the novel, which I didn't find enlightening. Somerset Maugham used to do it better.Bonus points for the photography. Bernardo Bertolucci may have let the story get away from him but he's got the desert and its denizens down pat. Some of the shots are extremely impressive, the ones that don't look like Bakersfield or Deming. Timbuktu, I was surprised to learn, is a small but flourishing city rather than a caravansary, no longer just Timbuk One. Another joke the point of which eludes me. If Terence Malick had been behind the camera there would have been inserts of the fauna, little lizards skittering around or a sawscale viper or something. Decent performances too.The first time I saw this I was swept up in the tale because I was curious about seeing where it would go, and then found myself engaged with the characters.

When Alien presented this story line, it was new, made sense, the movie had a great pace and was genuinely disturbing. The same storyline, about 18 years after the original was out, is a farce. Event Horizon simply does not even remotely create the dense atmosphere of horror that was created in Alien. The turning-evil of the scientist is very predictable. None of the characters (they all resemble the cool marines from Aliens by the way, including a couple of the typical weak women) is described well, and one hardly cares for them. And when you don't care for the characters, you are not afraid that something might happen to them. A great defect for a horror movie, because if you don't care, the movie is not scary. The movie is full of pathetic clichés. When the rescuers hear from the ghost-ship, they get an audio-message with the usual distorted screaming on it. They filter it, and voilà, one of the cool marines finds out that it actually is *Latin* and translates it immediately. Latin sounds spooky to some people, and that's probably why someone in deep space has nothing better to do then sending messages in Latin while he is being massacred. Incredible.

Not that I particularly think it would deserve a Best Picture nomination or anything, but I think the Academy might have. Still, an entire year after it first played in American theaters, Linda Hunt was so memorable in her role that she won the Best Supporting Actress award. She plays a very small Asian man. It's stunt casting, pure and simple, but, man, if it doesn't work. I knew about her work going in (and she is why I was interested in the film in the first place), so she couldn't quite disappear into the role for me, but she is quite convincing. A lot of the reason it works is because the role is so well written. In fact, Billy Kwan is the character with whom the audience most identifies, despite being kind of on the edge of the main action. It is his story you walk away remembering. Not to say that the rest of the film isn't good because it is. Mel Gibson plays an Australian reporter who hopes to get his big break during a revolutionary period in Indonesia. As the title implies, it is very dangerous there, even before President Sukarno is overthrown. Gibson is fine, if far from great. Sigourney Weaver plays his British love interest. She's fine, but doesn't have a lot to do. My second favorite performance in the film comes from Altman veteran Michael Murphy as an obnoxious American reporter who likes to go whoring. The story is good and very gripping. I think The Killing Fields told a very similar story even better a couple of years later (for which an actual Asian man won an Academy Award, though I don't say that to diminish Hunt's work here).

A light rom-com beginning where uptight yuppie Jeff Daniels meets punky free-spirit Melanie Griffitih, who does incredibly cliché things like throwing his pager out of the window, so he can stop living by the man's rules. The crazy wish-fulfilment scenario of the impish, erotic, impulsive woman only increases, with stealing, skipping out on checks, binge drinking, and lots of sex (left mostly off camera), all in the first few hours of meeting. Halfway through Ray Liotta enters and the movie switched into a kind of brutal thriller, and still works almost flawlessly. Instead of just making a movie that happens to be set in the 80's Demme fully embraces the period, music, dress, and small sub cultures at the peripheral, punks, bikers, early hip hop, reggae, indie rock bands, etc, and films them with a sincere fascination and not just an interest in trendy exploitation. He crafts a great soundtrack here and puts it to perfect use especially in the Reunion sequence when The Feelies do a bunch of fantastic cover songs. Cameos from John Waters and Sussie Tissue of Suburban Lawns were disappointingly brief, but that's not really a complaint. The unlikely scenario develops and changes, and we lean so much about the characters as the film goes on when it does become full of suspense it's easy to get dragged into their predicament even if you've seen it in a thousand other 80's movies. John Cale of The Velvet Underground is responsible for the score, and David Byrne (of the Talking Heads) does the opening song, both of which seem perfect matches for the material here. Demme's love of music is what makes all of his best films shine. I couldn't imagine Silence Of The Lambs without Buffalo Bill's dance in front of his mirror. It's this understanding of how to appropriate pop music and perhaps pop culture in general into cinematic terms which Something Wild's more than it's romantic odd couple comedy, road movie, and relationship drama origins would suggest. Armond White used the phrase multicultural heaven to describe Rachel Getting Married, and through Beloved, Philedalphia, and his various documentaries we see Demme deal with varying levels of success with cultural clashes and struggles, but in this early film like later in RGM he gives into his more Utopian impulses, and creates a diverse patchwork looking America. Something Wild appears on screen as America would sound from listening to it's catchiest songs (the one's you secretly howl in the shower or when no one is around). For the most part it is reminiscent of Ferris Bueller's Day Off in it's incredible unlikeliness, but more natural, sympathetic, and less juvenile, or like a more emotional less paranoid variation on Martin Scorcesse's After Hours. All of the characters down to the most minor are sympathetic from Melanie Griffith's mild American prototype Mom who is not ignorant of her daughter's wildness but not judgemental either. Similarly Ray Liotta's sociopathtic husband is not a cardboard barbarian, but the kind of guy you could spend a few hours with, always a little uneasy as to whether they are gonna put an arm around your shoulder or a flick a cigarette into your face. Before Liotta appears on screen the camera fades to black for a second, cuing the film's sea change in tone, which I didn't notice at first, but is a clever device. In many ways this is a standard American romantic comedy from it's time, but in the ways that are most important it's fun, unique and endearing. As the Ebert says, The accomplishment of Demme and the writer, E. Max Frye, is to think their characters through before the very first scene. They know all about Charlie and Lulu, and so what happens after the meeting outside that restaurant is almost inevitable, given who they are and how they look at each other. This is one of those rare movies where the plot seems surprised at what the characters do. Lots of movies are entertaining, and a good few are intelligent and emotional griping, but this movie just made me happy, from start to finish, which is even rarer. A friend of mine once told me I seemed like The Violent Femmes type, since we were friends I accepted her slight insult and implication of twee dorkishness. While watching the Something Wild, especially during the Feelies performance, I was flashing to the Violent Femmes music video for American Music, and remembering how charming and delightful it was. Some may find this sensibility annoying or a ploy, to distract from more serious issues or important themes. Such an inability to accept well developed style is not inarguable, I have been a curmudgeon for content over style many times myself. But so much of American popular music is slight, sexual, humorous, and waifash, that I feel it's a significant aspect of our culture worth enjoying on it's own terms. It's better to be a live dog, than a dead lion-Daniels. There is nothing wrong with enjoying popcorn-art from time to time. Every honest person enjoys some candy.

Not just 5, 10, 100 point films, but flawless to the point where numerical systems fail to be valuable. Peter Greenaway's third film is about three women a mother, daughter, and niece all named Cissie Colpitts, who one by one drown their husbands in a bath, in the sea, and in a pool. After the first drowning, the local coroner is asked to help cover up the crime, and he agrees believing this will give him car blanche to have his way with the new widow. He is rebuked in the first of several such attempts. His name is Madgett and he orchestrates for the town a series of seemingly random, perhaps ancient (in fact completely made up) games, consisting of strange rules and regulations, like Hangman's Cricket where half the game is spent learning the rules. Madgett's son is named Smut(our narrator), and Smut is interested in a young girl dressed in a fancy gown who always claims to be on her way to a party, and who jumps rope counting from 1 to 100 in the films opening sequence. Numbers appear in every scene whether spoken aloud or written on a small or large object in the background. One could make the film itself into a game called spot the numbers, which count from the first scene to the last from 1 to 100. The film is full of small details some so obscure they are likely to please no one but Peter Greenaway or those willing to watch his behind the scenes blow-by blow Fear Of Drowning, where for instance, we learn that many lines of dialog consist of the last words of England's kings, sometimes crazed non-sequitters muttered from their death beds. Why include such things, because it makes the game for fun, that's why. As always Greenaway composes every single sequence to achieve a sense of balance, and painterly poise. As usual most scenes, including idle landscape shots are recreations of paintings. Though the images are fantastic, the soundtrack by frequent collaborator Michael Nyman is stunning. I can't think of a director and composer whose works fuse together with such iconoclastic fluid grace since Sergio Leone and Ennio Mariconne. Nyyman's orchestral compositions are energetic, pulsating, lively, and captivating enough to be listened to and enjoyed apart from the film as its own music, and gives a sharp sense of irony and comic timing of its own to Greenaway's visual tableaux. Greenaway is not what you would call a humanist director, he rarely shoots close ups, instead remains in wide screen, and letting his characters take up positions as figures in an image, not actors on a stage, or in a film. This can be difficult to deal with if identification with characters is a pre-requisite for enjoyment, because the film aims for visual awe, wafts of aural pleasure, and snatches of witty literate dialog that only doesn't sound like dialog because of the casual delivery the lead actresses are able to give their macabre melodrama. Drowning By Numbers is a multi-layered film meant to be watched several times.It is a monument to be marveled at, but one where all of the elements of the film medium contribute the structure and design of the piece as whole, where form and content perfectly integrated into each other. The women who drown their husbands, at first do it out of anger, then out of disappointment, and finally out of solidarity, or in other words for no real reason at all. The pattern of threes needs to be complete, three murders, three autopsies, and three funerals. We know the husbands will die, they are as inexorably fated to their turns in the plot as all people are fated for death, as films are fated to end after a certain number of scenes. We are made hyper-aware of these numbers because they are flashed in a countdown on screen. Does anyone remember the death clock, http\/\/www.deathclock.com\/, how it works is after a few personal details are typed in a clock appears counting down to the exact moment you will die. You can watch your life flicker away by measurements. We are all drowning in numbers. Yet it's not all doom and gloom, because the coroner while being an eternal bachelor as fated to be rejected by the widows he assists as their husbands were to watery graves, he is also the master of games. Like his first film the Draughtsman's' Contract the battle of the sexes consumes the characters, where in Draughtsman, an artist who believes he is having his way with a mother and daughter discovers all to late, he is in fact being used and disposed of, so does Madgett find himself helpless in the face of female solidarity, leaving him to his only recourse of playing more games. Sure death is just around the corner at all times, but there are so many marvelous, silly, frivolous distractions to amuse ourselves with in the meantime; life and all of its contents. No Country For Old Men and Blow-Up have both made this same point about death's inevitability and life as a game of chance, but where both those films suffered a self-serious somberness Drowning By Numbers remembers to be a tragic-comedy and not just a tragedy. Life is absurd, of course of course, but the absurd can be very funny, and humor after all is happiness' cheeky cousin, sometimes inappropriate, but nearly always welcome. Smut The full flavor of the game Hangman's Cricket is best appreciated after the game has been played for several hours, by then every player has an understanding of the many rules and knows which character they want to play permanently, finally an outright loser is found and is obliged to present himself to the Hangman who is always merciless.

Nyyman's orchestral compositions are energetic, pulsating, lively, and captivating enough to be listened to and enjoyed apart from the film as its own music, and gives a sharp sense of irony and comic timing of its own to Greenaway's visual tableaux. Greenaway is not what you would call a humanist director, he rarely shoots close ups, instead remains in wide screen, and letting his characters take up positions as figures in an image, not actors on a stage, or in a film. This can be difficult to deal with if identification with characters is a pre-requisite for enjoyment, because the film aims for visual awe, wafts of aural pleasure, and snatches of witty literate dialog that only doesn't sound like dialog because of the casual delivery the lead actresses are able to give their macabre melodrama. Drowning By Numbers is a multi-layered film meant to be watched several times.It is a monument to be marveled at, but one where all of the elements of the film medium contribute the structure and design of the piece as whole, where form and content perfectly integrated into each other. The women who drown their husbands, at first do it out of anger, then out of disappointment, and finally out of solidarity, or in other words for no real reason at all. The pattern of threes needs to be complete, three murders, three autopsies, and three funerals. We know the husbands will die, they are as inexorably fated to their turns in the plot as all people are fated for death, as films are fated to end after a certain number of scenes. We are made hyper-aware of these numbers because they are flashed in a countdown on screen. Does anyone remember the death clock, http\/\/www.deathclock.com\/, how it works is after a few personal details are typed in a clock appears counting down to the exact moment you will die. You can watch your life flicker away by measurements. We are all drowning in numbers. Yet it's not all doom and gloom, because the coroner while being an eternal bachelor as fated to be rejected by the widows he assists as their husbands were to watery graves, he is also the master of games. Like his first film the Draughtsman's' Contract the battle of the sexes consumes the characters, where in Draughtsman, an artist who believes he is having his way with a mother and daughter discovers all to late, he is in fact being used and disposed of, so does Madgett find himself helpless in the face of female solidarity, leaving him to his only recourse of playing more games. Sure death is just around the corner at all times, but there are so many marvelous, silly, frivolous distractions to amuse ourselves with in the meantime; life and all of its contents. No Country For Old Men and Blow-Up have both made this same point about death's inevitability and life as a game of chance, but where both those films suffered a self-serious somberness Drowning By Numbers remembers to be a tragic-comedy and not just a tragedy. Life is absurd, of course of course, but the absurd can be very funny, and humor after all is happiness' cheeky cousin, sometimes inappropriate, but nearly always welcome. Smut The full flavor of the game Hangman's Cricket is best appreciated after the game has been played for several hours, by then every player has an understanding of the many rules and knows which character they want to play permanently, finally an outright loser is found and is obliged to present himself to the Hangman who is always merciless.

The truth is that the marketing campaign for the film is a far more interesting topic than anything that appears in the film itself (more on that later). A relatively simple tale of three amateur documentary filmmakers who vanish into the Maryland woods while investigating the title phenomena is the center of this film. The amateur nature of the film-making in that everything we see is fairly badly shot through a jittery hand-held camcorder is supposed to add authenticity and accentuate the you are there atmosphere of the unknown a la Romero's Night of the Living Dead. Unfortunately, a glaring discrepancy is that Romero's film actually had a solid premise to hang its low-budget authenticity on and the Blair Witch Project has nothing of the kind. The opening moments which introduce us to three characters, played by Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams, are dreadfully uninteresting and fail to do much to ingratiate the leads, other than to emphasize that Donahue is a type-A control freak who micromanages the entire foray into the woods badly. If anyone can figure out what the legend is that is supposed to be so fascinating to inspire a documentary and propel this story forward, they are doing better than I. The mishmash of background provided by snippets of interviews with locals indicate that the legend may or may not have something to do with a witch, a ghost and\/or an old male psycho who kidnaps people - the entire explanation is murky at best, which is a fatal flaw since we have no idea what exactly these people are searching for. While there would be some suspense to be mined from easily losing one's way in the wilderness, that quickly dissipates thanks to the ill-tempered characters basically shouting and cursing at other with dialog that is rather painfully made up on the fly. The supernatural elements are total misfires due to two issues 1) for much of the time, when the characters claim to hear something ominous in the nighttime forest, the audio is so bad that we often cannot hear the same things, and 2) the reactions to the most minor of events are so hysterical as to induce unintentional laughter (ie., someone sees a pile of sticks in the forest, which results in screaming and running). Of the actors, Leonard makes little impact in his limited screen time, Donahue is shrill and annoying, and Williams hints that he might have been able to do something worthwhile within a better structured film. By the end, few if anyone will know what, why, where, how or who The Blair Witch is. It is truly a shame that some of the savvy poured into the marketing did not wend its way into the film. Over-hyped as the little film that came out of no where, such a claim was near laughable since the internet had been abuzz for months before its release laying the ground work for the film and deliberately confusing easily credulous viewers that it was true and what they were seeing was actually a video found abandoned in the woods rather than actors playing a badly written plot. Coupled with a front page Time Magazine article, ready-to-be-duped patrons flocked in droves to see the true story of the poor young victims obliterated by the supernatural, only to subsequently be disappointed in that they were conned and the production they were conned into seeing was a badly filmed, motion sickness inducing, amateurishly acted mess. Don't believe me? Seriously, try to find anyone in the physical world (not in the anonymity of the internet) who will actually admit to having been terrified or even marginally entertained by this film. It takes a really long search. And in the age of similarly filmed efforts like Cloverfield or Paranormal Activity, Blair Witch's fading star gets less notable with each passing year.

Where I see it get constantly attack is how the digital effects are lousily executed and the cheap sets look plain. Sure the quality of the visuals does come up cheesy, but it remains a colourful, if bleak wasteland backdrop. The pulpy story might not be its strong point along with a silly script, however Carpenter's up-beat tempo moves along through its stagy, but excitingly expansive set-pieces with enough insanely cartoonish action, a jaded rock soundtrack and disposable wisecracks backing it up.

In the beginning, they are all happy friends with distinct traits. Nick is the outgoing, friendly, charismatic person. Steve is a shyer, but friendly, person who likes to act tough.

He talks Mike and Steve through Russian Roulette and ultimately saves Steve from imminent death. Nick becomes the middle man. He is frightened by war and its miseries, but he tries to remain strong. Nick, though, gets sucked into a worthless living because he chooses to stay in Vietnam and play Russian Roulette for money. Despite Mike's efforts to persuade Nick, Nick has already been too traumatized by war to go back to living a normal life. When Nick finally shoots himself in a game of Russian Roulette after Mike challenges him because he fails to bring him home (as he promised earlier in the film), it is basically putting Nick out of his misery.

He saved the three of them from a torture camp in Vietnam, then went on to save Steve a second time from being left in the jungle to die, and finally travels back to Vietnam to attempt to rescue his friend, Nick, who has fallen into a mental abyss and is trapped in himself and Vietnam.

But they stick together through everything (or at least try to). They all grow in different ways after being in Vietnam because their personalities are so different. Nick, submits himself to death because he cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel. Steve, is lucky enough to have friends who care about him and won't let him rot in a jungle alone.

From his debut film 'Mr. Smith' in 1976 to 'Unfaithful' in 2002, Lyne has only nine titles to his credit. This has been a matter of quality over quantity Lyne is selective with his material to the point of being overtly fussy, but it encourages his painstaking detail and thorough execution.As a prime example of the gaps in Lyne's biography, 'Unfaithful' is still his most recent film after eight years. The film seems an epilogue to his long-time focus on sexual relationships that peaked with 'Nine ½ Weeks' and 'Fatal Attraction,' both major successes in the 1980s. 'Unfaithful,' using similar material, was also a top box office attraction despite mixed reviews from critics; it has pocketed $122 million worldwide and an Oscar nomination for Diane Lane's performance.Lyne had long admired the work of French director Claude Chabrol, particularly in his 1969 drama 'La femme infidèle,' which became the starting point for 'Unfaithful.' For years, Lyne tossed around the idea of building on Chabrol's theme, but left matters alone. This changed, however, when the premise of 'La femme' was expanded by writers Alvin Sargent ('Julia,' 'Ordinary People') and William Broyles Jr. (TV's 'China Beach'). This new screenplay gave the affair considerably more detail and told the story with a frankness that is only nowadays possible.The plot of 'Unfaithful' is painfully simple, yet it touches upon a great many emotions and sentiments. Diane Lane plays Connie Sumner, a suburban New York housewife who has been married for several years to Edward (Richard Gere), the owner of an armored car company. Connie has borne one child, a son named Charlie (Erik Per Sullivan), who attends grammar school. The middle-class family appears stable and free of conflict, but it is painfully ordinary the large house, the Mercedes, and the shaggy dog look far too neat for problems not to exist beneath the surface.Connie is a former city resident who has yearned - at least in fantasy - for the bohemian life that Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez) represents. Martel is an antiquarian book dealer who plies his trade from a Manhattan loft. In striking relief to Connie's loving but dull husband, Martel embodies a raw, unbridled sexuality that draws her interest. Through a chance meeting on the street, Connie and Paul settle into an affair that is far more carnal than affectionate.With a husband and son waiting at home, it is only a matter of time before things start to unravel and hearts are broken. Infidelity is a topic worked to death by cinema, which made 'Unfaithful' a considerable risk to produce. Sargent and Broyles, however, tell the story from both Connie and Edward's viewpoint, leaving empathy for both characters. Tension also reaches high levels through the screenplay's effective plotting and dialogue.Diane Lane's performance was nominated for several acting awards, including the Oscar and Golden Globe. All three adult leads are very good, but Lane is the person who truly shines. Her performance is intense, nuanced, and without a moment's doubt of her character. Gere and Martinez are effective, particularly in a key scene where the two gentlemen meet. Lyne has done superb work in converting Gere from his usual grittiness to a more vulnerable figure.The one substantial flaw of this movie is that Paul Martel does not entirely work as a character. We have seen the French man of mystery a bit too often and Olivier Martinez is forced to climb uphill against the sarcasm that his character draws. Luckily, Martinez takes firm hold of the material and works to dispel the stereotype. It also seems that Erik Per Sullivan deserved more screen time as the couple's son, but he fills the child role excellently.Music duties went to Jan A. P. Kaczmarek, who has since won an Academy Award for 'Finding Neverland' in 2004. Kaczmarek's soundtrack uses regular orchestration, is unobtrusive, and effectively colors the given scenes. 'Unfaithful' is also the first Lyne project edited by Anne Coates ('Lawrence of Arabia,' 'Becket'). Cinematographer Peter Biziou ('Nine ½ Weeks') has returned to Lyne after an extended absence and costume designer Ellen Mirojnick ('Fatal Attraction,' 'Jacob's Ladder') stays on board.'Unfaithful' is frequently aired on television and there are plenty of DVDs to get your hands on. The 2002 release from 20th Century Fox is packed with extras, including a film-length commentary track with Lyne, commentary from Lane and Martinez on specific scenes, 11 deleted scenes with Lyne's remarks, cast interviews, a 15-minute featurette on Unfaithful's production ('An Affair to Remember'), and an editing featurette with Coates.The film is presented in anamorphic widescreen (1.851) with Dolby 5.1 surround sound. Dubbing is offered in Spanish and French, along with subtitles in Spanish and English. Both the video and audio of 'Unfaithful' are solidly treated. Lyne's commentary offers useful background on the production, especially on why scenes were dropped or changed. The deleted scenes include a moralistic ending that was pushed by 20th Century Fox executives but later dropped in favor of Lyne's version. Decades on, adultery is still a popular subject for filmgoers and Lyne's newest project (not to mention Lane's performance) is definitely worth seeing.*** out of 4Roving Reviewer - http\/\/rovingreviewer.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"9 May 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Compared to other directors of his ilk, Adrian Lyne's résumé is extremely short.

This has been a matter of quality over quantity Lyne is selective with his material to the point of being overtly fussy, but it encourages his painstaking detail and thorough execution.As a prime example of the gaps in Lyne's biography, 'Unfaithful' is still his most recent film after eight years. The film seems an epilogue to his long-time focus on sexual relationships that peaked with 'Nine ½ Weeks' and 'Fatal Attraction,' both major successes in the 1980s. 'Unfaithful,' using similar material, was also a top box office attraction despite mixed reviews from critics; it has pocketed $122 million worldwide and an Oscar nomination for Diane Lane's performance.Lyne had long admired the work of French director Claude Chabrol, particularly in his 1969 drama 'La femme infidèle,' which became the starting point for 'Unfaithful.' For years, Lyne tossed around the idea of building on Chabrol's theme, but left matters alone. This changed, however, when the premise of 'La femme' was expanded by writers Alvin Sargent ('Julia,' 'Ordinary People') and William Broyles Jr. (TV's 'China Beach'). This new screenplay gave the affair considerably more detail and told the story with a frankness that is only nowadays possible.The plot of 'Unfaithful' is painfully simple, yet it touches upon a great many emotions and sentiments. Diane Lane plays Connie Sumner, a suburban New York housewife who has been married for several years to Edward (Richard Gere), the owner of an armored car company. Connie has borne one child, a son named Charlie (Erik Per Sullivan), who attends grammar school. The middle-class family appears stable and free of conflict, but it is painfully ordinary the large house, the Mercedes, and the shaggy dog look far too neat for problems not to exist beneath the surface.Connie is a former city resident who has yearned - at least in fantasy - for the bohemian life that Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez) represents. Martel is an antiquarian book dealer who plies his trade from a Manhattan loft. In striking relief to Connie's loving but dull husband, Martel embodies a raw, unbridled sexuality that draws her interest. Through a chance meeting on the street, Connie and Paul settle into an affair that is far more carnal than affectionate.With a husband and son waiting at home, it is only a matter of time before things start to unravel and hearts are broken. Infidelity is a topic worked to death by cinema, which made 'Unfaithful' a considerable risk to produce. Sargent and Broyles, however, tell the story from both Connie and Edward's viewpoint, leaving empathy for both characters. Tension also reaches high levels through the screenplay's effective plotting and dialogue.Diane Lane's performance was nominated for several acting awards, including the Oscar and Golden Globe. All three adult leads are very good, but Lane is the person who truly shines. Her performance is intense, nuanced, and without a moment's doubt of her character. Gere and Martinez are effective, particularly in a key scene where the two gentlemen meet. Lyne has done superb work in converting Gere from his usual grittiness to a more vulnerable figure.The one substantial flaw of this movie is that Paul Martel does not entirely work as a character. We have seen the French man of mystery a bit too often and Olivier Martinez is forced to climb uphill against the sarcasm that his character draws. Luckily, Martinez takes firm hold of the material and works to dispel the stereotype. It also seems that Erik Per Sullivan deserved more screen time as the couple's son, but he fills the child role excellently.Music duties went to Jan A. P. Kaczmarek, who has since won an Academy Award for 'Finding Neverland' in 2004. Kaczmarek's soundtrack uses regular orchestration, is unobtrusive, and effectively colors the given scenes. 'Unfaithful' is also the first Lyne project edited by Anne Coates ('Lawrence of Arabia,' 'Becket'). Cinematographer Peter Biziou ('Nine ½ Weeks') has returned to Lyne after an extended absence and costume designer Ellen Mirojnick ('Fatal Attraction,' 'Jacob's Ladder') stays on board.'Unfaithful' is frequently aired on television and there are plenty of DVDs to get your hands on. The 2002 release from 20th Century Fox is packed with extras, including a film-length commentary track with Lyne, commentary from Lane and Martinez on specific scenes, 11 deleted scenes with Lyne's remarks, cast interviews, a 15-minute featurette on Unfaithful's production ('An Affair to Remember'), and an editing featurette with Coates.The film is presented in anamorphic widescreen (1.851) with Dolby 5.1 surround sound. Dubbing is offered in Spanish and French, along with subtitles in Spanish and English. Both the video and audio of 'Unfaithful' are solidly treated. Lyne's commentary offers useful background on the production, especially on why scenes were dropped or changed. The deleted scenes include a moralistic ending that was pushed by 20th Century Fox executives but later dropped in favor of Lyne's version.
