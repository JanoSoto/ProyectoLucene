The great thing about the old characters is that they had a connection with Earth and people.  It made them transforming into Earth vehicles all that much more fun too because we could relate to playing with cars, jets, etc. or seeing animals.

All women should be allowed to fight and autobots needed girlfriends anyway.

I'm going to spoil some stuff, so don't read if you don't want, but read on if you want to save some time and money.After I sat through this abomination, I knew I'd come on here and see that it got great reviews, because it tried to be so artsy that weak-minded people would say they liked it just to try to convince themselves that they have advanced taste.  Midway through I told myself that if I heard that I am Jake's this and that line again I would get up and leave, but sure enough I kept hearing it and I stayed.  Maybe I'm as dumb as the filmmakers. The fact of the matter is that I haven't seen a plot this full of holes since Slugs.  So if I start a fight club, the participants will just start showing up at my doorstep out of the blue and turn into mind-numbed drones that do my evil bidding???  Not only that, but this movie also taught me that if I stick a gun in my mouth and pull the trigger, not only will I live but I'll be able to talk to people in my normal voice, as long as I put a gauze pad on it.If you still don't know, this movie is about a clinically-depressed guy who's search for therapy leads him to Brad Pitt, who teaches him that beating the bejeezus out of people will brighten his spirits.  More guys find out about this, and they all join the fight club and then naturally go live with Pitt to become his evil minions.  Of course! This must be how the Wicked Witch found all those monkeys.  Their evil deeds get worse and worse, and the supposedly still-sane Norton inexplicably keeps hanging out with this bunch.  This leads to one totally inane scene where the evil monkeys return from a gunfight with one of their members dead, and all Norton can do is whine C'mon guys, cut it out.So after this movie backs itself into a miserable corner, it's only escape is the equally awful It was all a dream ending, where we find out that Brad Pitt was just Norton's evil imaginary friend, and that Norton had been committing all these acts himself.  Please audience, forget the fact that the imaginary Pitt managed to pull Norton from a burning car wreck and pick him up off the ground and hurl him down a flight of stairs.  I don't care how psycho you are, your imaginary friend cannot physically pick you up.Plot hole #9233 asks us to believe that during this short time, Norton had been in EVERY MAJOR CITY in the US forming more armies of mind-numbed robot monkeys, and that every male over the age of 18 in the United States was now a member of his secret evil gang.  So anyhow, Norton finally realizes that he's been crazy all this time, and to kill Pitt he sticks a gun in his own mouth and blows his neck off, a wound which apparently isn't as debilitating as you would think, since he manages to get right up and make up with his girlfriend and watch peacefully as his evil plot comes to fruition.  But wait, you thought he was sane now and would be horrified at what he did? So would I, but that apparently also is not the case.Before you typically think that my movie tastes aren't as cultured as yours, let me tell you that I loved the masterpiece that was A Clockwork Orange, and this movie was NO Clockwork.

Boring, and that's really it. It's so boring that it's boring to write about it. The reason I'm writing is that after reading a number of reviews I'm thinking one of my favorite thoughts  How come the same thing can be extremely funny or deeply moving for some people and totally boring for others? I think it all comes down to a surprise factor. People who study the anatomy of humor, say that things that are absurd, but bear some resemblance to reality, are humorous. Needless to say, the sense of absurd and reality is deeply individual, based not only on our life's experiences, but also on our temperament, philosophy, outlook -  you name it. While first (the experiences) are somewhat correlated by the fact that we live at the same time in the same society (that's why there is such thing as national humor - good luck catching some of my favorite Russian jokes), the other factors differ greatly from individual to individual.Let's come back to What women want. The three (supposedly) funniest moments in the movie, the three hilarious examples of female thinking (all covered in trailers or other reviews already, so I'm not spoiling anything here) are    1) woman taking Advil to fake a headache and avoid sex    2) Hunt being horrified by the fact that she looked (just looked, nothing else) below Gibson's waste (she didn't even stop her eyes there, which would've made her horror understandable - anyone who went through sexual harassment training at work knows what I'm talking about)    3) Gibson's daughter admiring the dress she'll be wearing on the night she's planning to loose her virginity.This is a simple tester.

I think part of the reason I love `Ravenous' so much is that it often seems that no one else does; either due to not having seen it, or just not appreciating it.  I admit, it's the kind of movie you're going to love or hate, either you get it or you don't.  But I can remember seeing it in the theater the first time, and just not being able to believe that I was laughing at what I was laughing at.   That's really the best way I can sum up my reaction to this film; there's a certain absurdity underlying all of its themes. It seems like the biggest confusion with people\/critics and `Ravenous' is over whether or not it's intent is to be comic.  Indeed the comic tone is established from the very beginning, from the opening quotes and first scene.  To be sure, it is certainly dark, very very dark comedy, with an interesting mix of `cannibal\/vampirism' (see Roger Ebert's review, the only one I've read that does Ravenous justice). However, director Antonia Bird does carry some more serious themes throughout Ravenous, but with a biting satirical edge-- she particularly seems to be commenting on American excessive consumption of all kinds, from meat-eating (and human-flesh eating in this case), to manifest destiny.  Most powerful is the truthful notion that we all must kill to live in some way or another, and in our willingness or unwillingness to do so, we must differentiate between cowardice and morality.  I'm just pounding the dark comedy thing into the ground though because I think that watching Ravenous, it is very important to keep in mind that principally it is supposed to be humorous, and yes, you are supposed to laugh at cannibalism believe it or not, because if you don't, you'll probably just find the film gory and disgusting.Ravenous is carried by its bold, wacky, charismatic characters.  Well, okay, the one exception here is Guy Pearce as central character Captain John Boyd, who is rather subdued in contrast to everyone else, quite intentionally so. Pearce does a very fine job making Boyd very quiet, introspective, and uncomfortable as he is sent to the wonderfully creepy and dysfunctional Fort Spencer, due to his discovered cowardice in war. Robert Carlysle is also excellent as the crazy Colqhoun\/Ives. I liked the rest of the people at Fort Spencer, all eccentric in their own ways, although all may not last too long. It's nice to see Jeremy Davies as the adorable, religious Toffler, but Neal McDonough is the real stand out as the tough, super-hero like character of Reicht, `the soldier'; with his icy blue eyes and shocking white-blond hair he is the epitome of bravery and masculinity, and certainly forms a direct contrast to the sensitive, cautious, and all-too-human Boyd. Basically, the plot comes to revolve around an old Native American legend--the Wendigo myth&#150;-which states when a man eats another man he takes on his strength and spirit.  There are quite a few twists and turns and surprises in Ravenous that should be enough to hold any viewer's attention.The soundtrack to this film is also quite striking and omnipresent; with original eerily beautiful orchestral tracks that add much of the atmosphere in every situation. Particularly beautiful is the simple, little &#145;Boyd's theme', which is used throughout the film as Boyd journeys.  The music adds not only to the eerieness of the film, but yes, even the humor.  If there is any point at which I still had any kind of doubt about Ravenous being comical it was shattered in a scene where Boyd and Reicht go after the evil Ives, and I hear classic banjo `chase music' complete with yodelling; you just can't help but laugh and shake your head. And even though everyone else already has, I'll give another nod to the cinematography of the gorgeous yet bleak and dangerous icy mountain range.Ravenous is classic for scenes of such absurd, dark humor in any situation, as when (in the same chase scene) Boyd leaps off a cliff to go tumbling down a hill and crashes into Reicht.  Just when a moment is getting serious, it boldly will hit you with such a cartoonish image. Like i said, either you'll love it, or you just won't. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what it is about Ravenous that grabs me so much, but it is just a combination of everything. It's like no movie I've ever seen. It's smart, satirical, observant and insightful (watch for a nice use of Ben Franklin quotes), and yes, funny. While not for everyone, it surely has cult film potential written all over it.

It seems ironic that Ripley asks Newt to wait up front in the APC, while I waited to go to the bathroom.But as a 24 year-old man, this movie is just amazing.Every part is memorable and it is truly an example of how to make a good movie. Each character is original and there is no dead weight in terms of plot. I still think this is one of the best action film soundtracks I have heard\/watched. However, I think I would've liked to have seen Hudson make it out alive.The Special Edition DVD is really good as well. Love the test footage of the Queen Alien. Love the remote sensory weapons that weren't in the theatrical release. I still think a good miniature is better than CGI. It goes to show that you still need an imagination to create a good film. I wish Cameron had done the next two as well!One last point of interest-- Why isn't Micheal Biehn in more movies? The guy is awesome.P.S. Watch Hicks smart-mouth Vasquez when she says 'Where they are'. ","genre":null},{"date":"11 June 2001","score":"","review":"  As a 10 year-old boy, this movie made me petrified.
