Just how in the hell did they manage to do that? Easy.  By having NO script and a load of talentless 'superstars' (i.e. Ben Affleck).  Ben Affleck was one of the most worthless, stupidest characters I've ever witnessed in a movie.  What was his purpose?.... to just mess everything up and be as inept as possible?  The acting was horrible, which doesn't help the fact that the 'script' is pure nonsense.

I didn't see the last half hour or so and I truly don't care to know\/see what happens.

I have watched it since I was a child and admire this movie for its theatrical scope - as a movie buff, this is a milestone for me and my viewing experience because it is a breakthrough in narrative and for that reason alone I am thankful. I will always remember it and always take it into mind as one of the best examples of a director holding an audience and controlling them in his grip.But (and this is a huge but) it has not aged well over the years. Many of its scenes that depict space travel had audiences sprawled in awe - it was the first feature film to really depict outer space as something realistic (and man hadn't even landed on the moon yet!). But compared to today's films, it is not very good. It is corny, overlong and unrealistic. Back then, it was a reason to see the film. Now, it's not impressive at all. This may seem ignorant, but think about it for a minute - why should we praise a film for being the first of its kind when other films have come along and done the same thing, much better?I understand doing this to a certain extent - but to say 2001 is great solely because of its effects and for being the first is silly, as far as I see it, because much of it now just isn't very good. Cinema elitists enjoy explaining the reason it is still great because of its effects. The point they seem to always bring up is ...at the time of its release.... I understand this but _now_ it is no longer fascinating as it's been done many times since.Kubrick is too fascinated with long empty passages of nothingness. It's like some self-indulgent ego-trip - take the opening for example. Four minutes (!) of absolutely nothing occurring on screen, just eerie music. Finally it opens, like some sort of epic opera and we are shown the planet's eclipse with the famous soundtrack, etc.I find this incredibly poor storytelling, not because I think it's boring or too slow but because it is pointless. I admire long movies (Once Upon a Time in America 4-hour version is wonderful) but 2001 has many scenes that go on endlessly, needlessly. There's a difference between slowness (any Leone film will be) but at least Leone uses this as a canvass for exploring something - Kubrick, many times in this particular film (and maybe only this film), doesn't really show us anything meaningful. It's like we're staring at a moving spacecraft for two minutes. I check my watch at three minutes when the music is starting to tell us it may be over soon and I think, Did that in any way actually improve the story itself, or show us anything useful?No. It's basically bragging to the audience - look how good it looks. Problem is it looks like crap nowadays.The critics tend to love this long nothingness because of its artistic merits. And I somewhat understand this - I can understand praising 2001 for its uniqueness, its powerful narrative. But the fact of the matter is that as a movie it's simply not very good because of this! It has dated very poorly. E.g. the space station segments - they are one of the only moments in the film with extensive dialogue. The futuristic suits are laughably '60s-ish and some of the ideas in the movie about communication via video, etc. are ludicrous.That happens in any movie after a certain amount of time, but 2001 almost entirely depends upon this. I feel the actual story itself is weak. Kubrick is at a loss for anything useful so he delays it by continually showing us exterior shots of spacecraft and planets in tune with classical pieces.It just gets to be too much after a while.This all said, please understand I am not putting down this movie. I still admire it very much for what it is and will watch it for years to come. But as a piece of entertainment, as a movie...I find it poor and self-indulgent on Kubrick's behalf. It lacks the satirical bite of A Clockwork Orange. The end sequence is horribly outdated with drug-trip visuals (it was rumored to have been one of the movies stoners would go see on a regular basis!). Like everything in this movie, it goes on too long - look at Easy Rider and Midnight Cowboy. Both have '60s\/'70s druggie sequences but both end before becoming intolerable - 2001 goes on too long...My review may seem very incomplete, ignorant and contradictory but if I had to explain it all in summary I'd just say this 2001 is a piece of art, but it is not a good movie in any way. I have seen art house films with better plots (Punch-Drunk Love, Magnolia) and more involving stories. 2001 is a showcase for special effects and directorial styles - but now it is very outdated and alienating and this is my biggest problem with it. I can't rate this movie because I would rate it 5\/5 in some ways, but very low in others. As a movie it's simply not very good - as a breakthrough\/unique art-house type picture it's a great example of how a director can control a movie to the fullest.

My philosophy is that all computer adaptations are terrible and to this day i have been right. i shouldv'e listened to my own advise when going to see this movie, in fact i shouldn't have even bought the ticket but i saw it anyway.I think the main reason that alot of my friends liked this film was because it starred Angelina Jolie and it had a scene with her in the shower. Although titilation can be appealing it DOES NOT make a movie.To its credit Simon West (director) does know how keep the addrenaline junkies happy. This film does have some impressive action sequences that keep you on your toes. But like many other plain old action movies this doesn't detract from the fact that this is just a popcorn blockbuster that is there to bring in the cash.And like The Mummy Returns it feels rushed. This is a film that had to meet a short deadline and that is why it looks so messy. By the time the credits role you will think that there was alot more that could have been done to make the movie better if they had the time to do it.In the end i don't want to slag this movie off too much as there are certain bits that i liked. But other than the two time i went to see it i would not subject myself to sitting through it again. For what i enjoyed its faults tip the ballance and what is left is a piss poor adaptaion of and entertaining video game.2\/5 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"19 January 2004","score":"","review":"  Well, this review is probably very very late but I thought to my self why not.

I watched Goodfellas years before I watched The Godfather series but when I watched The Godfather part one, I was amazed by how well this movie was made. I mean for anyone who thinks that Goodfellas is better than The Godfather, if you watch the two movies carefully, you'll find a scene in The Godfather part one when James Cann(Sonny) gets a call from his sister Talia Shire(Connie) and finds out that her husband hit her badly again, so he goes to her but he get whacked in the way over, the same scene repeats itself in Goddfellas when Lorraine Bracco (Karen) calls Ray Liotta(Henry) and the same thing happens again except that this time Ray doesn't get whacked in his way over to beat the sh*t out of Karen's neighbor friend. It is wrong comparing any movie with the Godfather and vice versa but still it is good that Martin Scorsese was able to make a movie that was and still a movie that I like to watch from time to time and keep in mind that no one is able to make movies like this anymore, not even Martin Scorsese himself.

I was babysitting for a friend of my mums, and one of the kids suggested we watch it. Thinking it was the frankly laughable 'Prince of Thieves' they were slipping into the video recorder, I was prepared for a few hours of boredom, What I got came as a shock, a pleasant one I'll admit, but still a shock.Now, you all know the Robin Hood legend don't you? I shall explain a little. Robin Hood was a Saxon criminal, nicking money here and there and giving it to people who needed it, all the while seducing the beautiful Maid Marion, and vexing the Sheriff of Nottingham and prince john. That's the basics! Now, on with the review.This movie was released in 1993, and is a take off of the whole Robin Hood legend and a p--- take of Prince of Thieves in particular.Loosely following the legend, Robin of Loxley is first encountered in an Arabic prison during the third century crusades, and together with a 'Moor' as they were called in those days, he executes a cunning escape with a cellmate, Asneeze.After escaping, Asneeze beseeches Robin to find his son Atchoo, a foreign exchange student in England and look out for him. This Robin vows to do! Robin swims back to England.He returns to his home, Loxley castle to find it being wheeled away on the back of the cart by Bailiffs, and goes through he sorrowful revelation that his father, dog, cat, and even the goldfish are all dead. Desperate for a familiar face, he finds the family's loyal blind servant Blinkin sitting on the toilet with a Jazz mag in Braille. The hilarity continues throughout the movie.As with all Robin Hood stories, Robin must thwart the evil plans of Prince John and the sheriff of Rottingham, who are wreaking havoc and charging exorbitant taxes on King Richards's kingdom while he's away.Those familiar with the movies Mel Brooks has previously directed will have some small idea of what to expect. After all, this is the man responsible for Dracula-dead and loving it and young Frankenstein. All the jokes, which range from visual gags to wonderful witty comments are in exactly the right places throughout the movie, with never more than a minute between laughs.Cary Elwes (incidentally the only English man to play Robin Hood in a movie), who many of you will know from Princess Bride brings his cheeky grinning twinkle eyed presence to this movie, and does a wonderful job. From outlandish heroic posturing, to a wickedly sexy glance, he really is amazingly funny. And the man looks better in tights than I do!Richard Lewis is hilarious as the whiny, arrogant Prince John with the ever-changing mole. He gets the sissy-boy behaviour down to a tee, and his whinging American vocalisations are great. All the way through the movie, a mole on his face constantly changes position it starts on his left cheek, then over to his right cheek, then his chin, then his forehead, before going back to it's original place. This is a subtle joke based on the mole on Alan Rickman when he played the sheriff in Prince Of ThievesRoger Rees as the sleazy sheriff of Rottingham is marvellously slimy and nasty, and has some great lines throughout the film.There are some faces here you'll be familiar with from other Brooks films. For instance Robert Ridgely, playing the hangman in this film also played the hangman in Blazing Saddles, another film directed by Brooks. He likes to add subtle references to his earlier films too; with several in this film that die-hard Brooks fans will easily spot. Those who watched History of the World part 1 will recognise the music to the song 'Men in Tights'. Also, when Patrick Stewart arrives and snogs Marion, Mel himself (playing Rabbi Tuckman) utters the line 'it's good to be a king', one of his lines in History of the world.The whole cast is wonderfully comedic, even those with only a few lines bring a great depth of warmth and humour to themWhat makes this film so wonderfully warm and funny in my own opinion are all the improvised scenes. Although there was a script of sorts, some scenes were completely improvised by the actors themselves, such as the scene where Latrine (Tracey Ullman) prays for Rottingham in her bed, and he falls through the ceiling, landing right where she wanted him, which was totally devised and thought out by the two actors.There are few special effects, and those that are there are small but fun moments of computerised camera trickery.The soundtrack is memorable, with some very funny songs, and a couple of cheesy love songs. You'll be singing 'Men in tights' or at least humming it to yourself, for weeks.The rating is Pg, to which I say BAH HUMBUG. There is no bad language in the film, except in the use of double entendre, and one utterance of sh!t, and violence is minimal. In fact I'd go as far as to say non-existent, apart from a few comedy fight scenes.A great fun film that adults and children alike will enjoy!

The movie, A Beautiful Mind, deals with the difficulty of living with schizophrenia. John Nash is a schizophrenic who attends Princeton University and is able to solve math problems that baffle even the greatest minds. Right from the beginning we noticed that social interaction is extremely tough for John. When John has to make conversation with other people we realize some of the first symptoms with his disorganized speech and disorganized thoughts and behavior. Throughout the movie we continue to notice he has much difficulty talk with others except when with one person. When John is with his `roommate' Charles we notice that all trouble talking and thinking is eliminated. From there we might understand that Charles isn't real and just a figment of the imagination. Later on when schizophrenic images have driven John to the edge Dr. Rosen confronts him at a math speech John is giving. Dr. Rosen gives John shock therapy and we see John having convulsions while strapped down on a medical bed. Besides the shock therapy Rosen also gives John a heavy dose of medicine and asks Alicia Nash, John's wife, to watch out for him. Dr. Rosen also has to face the hardest part of telling John that people he thinks he knows are not real. John has a tough time getting a grip on reality and sometimes can't even turn to his wife. During a schizophrenic episode while attempting to knock away `William Parcher's gun' pointed to his wife but instead hits his wife. This and John's forgetfulness with his baby so how hard it can be to care for someone with schizophrenia. With these two episodes Alicia even has to move out until John can understand what is real and what is not. A moment occurs when John comes to grips with reality with himself and tells Alicia that he knows that the images are not real. He says that Becky never got any older the images are not real. From this point we know John we fight these illusions until he is `better.' During the movie we become attached to his illusions and just as it is for John it is tough for us to let them go. Near the end John tells us when he is asked if the illusions are still there, he says that they are never gone I just don't answer them. Unfortunately at this time that's all that could be done. In the end John has triumphed in the biggest way, he has put the images out of his mind and wins the Nobel Peace prize. He then gives an emotional speech crediting everything that he has done to his wife, and rightfully so. What makes this so much more realistic is that it is.

The climax while spectacular and unforgettable isn't realistic if you think about it too much, and Janet Leigh's character goes through some heavy stuff then suddenly it's all glossed over. But you know what? It just doesn't matter. I can't see anybody watching it thinking these few flaws spoiled it. Welles' direction is astonishing, subtle and yet flamboyant if that makes any sense. His acting is also first rate. He's virtually unrecognizable as Quinlan and gives one of the best performances of his career. Leigh is very good, as is Joseph Calleia who plays Quinlan's loyal sidekick. I also really enjoyed Dennis Weaver's bit as a jumpy motel clerk and Marlene Dietrich as an enigmatic gypsy. I think it takes three or four viewings of 'Touch Of Evil' to really start to appreciate it as it's full of interesting moments that might pass you by at first. 'Citizen Kane' is universally regarded as Welles' masterpiece but 'Touch Of Evil' is the Welles I watch the most. It's an utterly brilliant movie that is still extremely underrated.

Lawrence of Arabia... and so on. it sounds like Bill Murray doing his lounge singer routine in the original SNL. there are very many stale jokes in this semi-cult flick that i think robert wuhl might've stolen from a crackerjack box, that is, they seemed adlibbed by the tubby comic. the music, like this movies daddy, AMERICAN GRAFFITI, is what is playing on all the car radios, is pretty good - but not as classic a selection as Lucas' masterpeice had. also there are shots from the inside of the cars and drag races. what is original is that they dragrace two asian guys - this was borrowed and used in BETTER OFF DEAD a few years later.
