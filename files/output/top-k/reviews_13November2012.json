Tom Hanks has stared in hundreds of movies that were instant hits but Forest Gump was by far his top performance. There are also many aspects that make this movie the top movie of its time. One scene particularly of the movie really describes what kind of man the main character is and, gives a big glimpse of who he is.Tom hanks has stared in many hit movies; like, The Green Mile, Saving Private Ryan, And The Da Vinci Code. This movie is different that other because it really suits the personality of Tom Hanks and, in the making of this movie it is obvious that he had a lot of fun portraying the role of Forest Gump. The character Forest Gump is portrayed as a man who as a child was bullied a lot as a child because of his leg brace and lack of intelligence. He never new the importance of his life. As a child he met Elvis Presley and gave him the inspiration to do his dance moves that were considered atrocious in that day in age. Also had a great talent for running as he discovered as he was running from Bullies who were on bicycles and a truck chasing him through the fields. As he grew up he didn't gain much more brain power but gained the power of care, empathy, and love. This screen play is sure to make you cry but laugh just as much. That is exactly what the directer Winston Groom was trying to achieve with this film.Furthermore, this film is considered by me and thousands of other people across the globe. This movie won 26 awards and nominated for countless others. Critics have made this a easy 8.7 but, I would give it a ten. Sure to make laugh cry and all of the in between. This was the best movie made its century because of the selfless acts that the main character, Forest Gump had done for his country and those around him. His lack of knowledge on curtain subjects he makes up in his empathy for others and the selfless acts for his friends and family.Although, Forest talks funny and some may consider this annoying. This is a long movie that jumps from scene to scene and one has to be deeply involved in the story line to understand it. People may also question the authenticity of all acts that Forest Gump did. People may also get confused with all of the character that are introduced and later plays a important role.Nevertheless, Forest is a small town man who listens to what he is told and always remembered the quote that everyone has hear one time or another,  Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates you open it up and you never know what your going to get. That really meant a lot to Forest because he keeps a open mind to all options and everyone has a place in his heart. For example he just joined the military, and met someone named, Bubu. Bubu and Forest soon became good friends and when Bubu got injured in the battle field, Forest ran back into the dense jungle riddled with gun shots and explosions in search of his friend Bubu with out thinking. This really gave a big inside view on the character of Forest Gump. However, the choice is up to you. Do you think this is a movie that you would thoroughly enjoy? Or just another movie that goes down in your list of movies that you wish to see. It just depends on the kind of movie you enjoy and connect to. If you like comedy, romance, war all in one movie, then I would bump it right up to the top of your list of things to watch.Forest Gump ","genre":null},{"date":"13 November 2012","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The movie Forest Gump Was the best movie that Tom Hanks ever stared in.

Firstly I should say that I loved the book and the book scared me rigid. The movie, while based on the book, ignores several (some might consider important) aspects of Mr King's masterpiece.So having watched the movie I felt a little disappointed at the changes in story line, especially the failure of Jack to be slowly seduced into madness, for me it all happened a bit to quickly and easily. There were none of the scenes of him alone in the boiler room discovering the troubled history of the hotel. In the book stuff starts happening to Jack before the others suspect anything to be wrong and he travels a gradual path towards insanity. The topiary animals in particular was a scene conspicuous by it's absence. Apparently it was left out due to SFX budget restrictions, but how hard would it have been to have some hedge animals appearing closer to him every time he looked round? Some clever camera work and appropriate music and it could have worked well. A chilling scene from the book lost in the film.I also didn't find it particularly scary, however I think this is because having read the book I kind of knew most of what was coming and how things were likely to turn out.A final couple of negatives - Shelly Duval's acting in the early stages of the film was very wooden and unbelievable, and even later in the film you wonder if she's just reading the lines, her reactions at times are pathetic and unrealistic too (I mean the waving of the baseball bat at him on the staircase - was she trying to hit him or swat a fly?) but to be fair her performance in the bathroom as Jack axes his way through was terrific. The other negative for me - the much lauded musical score grated with me and sounded hideously dated. (Yes I know the film is over 30 years old but some music is timeless, this sounds like somebody experimenting with his new synthesiser).So why the high score you may ask? Well I have to be fair. Suppose I hadn't read the book? The story remains classic, Jack Nicholson's performance is superb, the cinematography is amazing and there is genuine tension and suspense. I remember watching the film many years ago (before I read the book) and I remember it affecting me considerably. There is no doubt that it IS a very scary film, I had just been desensitised by knowing the story (nothing is ever as scary the second time around) And it was the psychological stuff that was especially scary too, not the traditional baddie jumping out of a cupboard kind of scary - the scene where Wendy discovers Jack's 'work' by the typewriter for example was utterly chilling.So overall a thumbs up. An excellent film, flawed certainly (especially if you know the original story) but nonetheless a very good watch.Recommended.

A tour de masterpiece of potent scenes, some truly unforgettable, dramatic, shocking, a little thanks to Madonna's hit Live To tell that plays at different instrumental speeds throughout the film.

The dialogue between son and the returning father is bizarre. He even has to consult with his son, if the other son, is the guy flopped out on his couch, which he isn't. Wanting to escape his dead, small town existence, Brad Junior (Penn) and his friends join up with his father's gang. This gang consists of some real scary types from A level actors who each bring something to the table. You even get to see how this professional gang of thieves operate on some jobs, one including Penn on his first job, alone with the guys, before he brings his mates in. Later on, when him and his mates stuff up, and are arrested, jeopardizing his father's operation, Brad Senior has them picked off, one after the other, in consecutive scenes, while Brad Junior remains in lockup. They all die in the same location, which I found haunting. The father's an absolute piece of s**t. A great use of scene atmosphere is at a cockfight, with Walken talking with a shady acquaintance, about arranging the killings. There's also of course, a love interest, Penn's new girlfriend, Terri (Mary Stuart Masterson) one of those impressive young actresses of the eighties. What the hell happened to her? Sadly for Terri, her fate meets with tragic ends in a arranged execution, that Penn remarkably survives.

Through the absorbing realistically-handled journey of the Joad Family, sharecroppers from Oklahoma, the movie is a tacit homage to all the farmers who were kicked out of their own land after half a century, and by an enemy even more redoubtable because he was invisible. Call it corporations, banks, politics, it's impossible to point a finger on a responsible person, let alone a gun, all the 'Okies' are left with is a bitter resignation mixed with the hopes for brighter futures in California, the promised land.Through its documentary value, The Grapes of Wrath works as the perfect contradiction to all the supporters of Capitalism as the core of American ideals. It's a film about the little people, those who had faith and lost it. The central character is Tom Joad, an ex-convict, released after four years. Joad was imprisoned for homicide but doesn't carry any regret, the 'victim' had it coming he pulled a knife. Joad is the kind of more-or-less decent individual victim of unfortunate circumstances but learns to deal with them rather than whining. The second representative character is Casey, an ex-preacher played by John Carradine. The preacher lost the spirit, and it hardly surprises that it's Communism he embraces at the end.An ex-convict, an ex-preacher, ex-farmers, the gallery consists of a bunch of people who 'used to be', and seem incapable to conjugate the life in the future. In a world where farmers are forced to leave the land they walked on and died on, what positive can ever be presaged? The fear ends up killing Grandpa Joad, and the grandmother doesn't outlive him for long. But one person doesn't fear future; it's Ma Joad, and Jane Darnell embodies the pioneer spirit, temerity despite exhaustion, with her droopy but magnificently scintillating eyes. When they live the farm, she doesn't give a last look for they're going to California, and she has no time to mourn the past. She's not braver than the others the night before, she meditated on her own sadness, alone, but as the heart of the Joadses, it's her duty to exude the happiness the Family is looking forward. The power of The Grapes of Wrath is to vehicle its powerful and inspirational message through characters rather than facts. Ma Joad, through her eyes, smiles and spirit, incarnates the ferocious and so womanly attachment to practical stuff like eating, living, being clean, she's the unwounded soul of that crisis-stricken America. On the other hand, men are more inclined to think, to translate the facts into abstract notions, and ultimately to fight. Tom Joad is no more eager to become an agitator than anyone else, but the odyssey of the road 66, opened his eyes on the new face of America. Either facing the disdain or the support of fellow citizens, he understands that the salvation cannot come from the individual but from solidarity. His We all got little pieces of the one big soul that belongs to everybody almost sounds like a spiritual protest slogan.It's even ironic that a right-wing conservative directed The Grapes of Wrath, but the whole socialist and communist undertones were less taboo at that time. The film was adapted from the Pullitzer-prize winning novel of John Steinbeck, released in 1939, at the dawn of a worldwide conflict that put the Red Scare into perspective. Naturally, the farmer's contribution to the war efforts leaded them to a more prosperous state, from which their descendants benefited. But as a slice of the American life during the 30's, the film encapsulates all the desperation, the fears and the hopes of a population that stopped to believe in its own ideals. And now that the world is stricken by another crisis, with the financial system, and the most pervert side of Capitalism as responsible, it's time to look at The Grapes of Wrath with a new eye for the film is still relevant today, maybe more than when it was praised as one of the greatest American films of all-time.And cinematically speaking, it's also a gripping adaptation that conveys the oppressive feeling of this era through a very powerful black-and-cinematography. There's indeed a magnificent contrast between the shadowy photography of the earlier scenes and the sunnier ones when they arrive in the campground in California. At one part, Casey makes a poignant preach implying that he found a new faith, his face hides in the shadow while his eyes are clearly seen, as to suggest a new lucidity, as if the use of lights allowed him to shine within his own words. The same goes for Henry Fonda during his memorable I'll be there speech, although the lines seem less spontaneous or more cinematic. And this is not to blame on the script but rather on Fonda who magnificently played a character full of anger and hopes, always distant but never unnoticeable, that's Fonda's charisma, subtle but irreplaceable, Fonda who should have won the Oscar for Best Actor.The film was nominated for several other Oscars, it lost the Best Picture to Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca but won a Best Supporting Actress for Jane Darnell and Best Director for John Ford. The two awards are much deserved for Darnell is the heart of the film, and fittingly concludes it with her immortal We're the people, you sure are, Ma &#x85; and John Ford who works each shot with an admirable craftsmanship. Many of them show all the Joadses in one frame as to continually sustain the idea of their unshakable unity, which is the kind of values that the film stands for unity and solidarity.Quite odd from an American film to celebrate these ideals, but this is what makes it such an endearing, timeless, and universal classic.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"13 November 2012","score":"","review":" There is a heavy B movie feel to this but it is a damn good B movie. It packs quite a few genuine scares and definitely enough suspense to hold your attention. I am also quite impressed by the visual effects used smartly and only when required. Acting could have been a lot better though. Set in Antarctica, the movie starts with a Norwegian member of a different station chasing a dog on his helicopter and in the act ventures into the American station's territory and injures one of the members while fully absorbed in his mission. They put him down, take the dog and decides to investigate what is going on in their camp. When they realize that a shape shifting Alien is among them consuming and imitating one crew member at a time, they stop trusting each other and more so themselves. The starting sequence is eerie that pans out quite leisurely with simple yet terrific background score. The build-up to the Thing could have been a little more progressive like in 'Alien' than one guy listing down what all it is capable of just by examining it's blood sample. Where the drama triumphs is the tension between the characters to trust each other than the fear of the Thing itself. It does have innumerable logical loop holes but clever enough screenplay that puts them on the background.

When it says Freddy killed every teens that means he killed Alice. But HOWEVER he never killed Alice. She has survived at the end of the movie and saved her unborn child. She survived because of Amanda Kruger who helped her out. Even Nancy survived though she wasn't teen anymore. She died from something else. But anyway I loved this whole series. It just gets better and better every time. My favorite one from this series was this one and the fifth one. I even loved A New Nightmare where Nancy comes back one last time. There were a lot of scary parts, funny parts, even a lot of gross blood and gore parts. I'd watch them over and over again. I'd even buy the whole series on DVD as well.

And his love interest, Graham, seems remarkably unaware of the potential for problems that a priest might face if discovered to be having a gay affair.Given the church's history of burying such problems rather than dealing with them, the reactions of the bishop may or may not have been realistic, although an amazing number of people seem to be borderline drama queens in this film, not least Father Greg who turns the focus of everyone's problems onto himself even before he manages to hit the headlines.Probably the most convincing acting came from the angry parishioners and other priests whose cranky approach to Christianity was underscored by their behavior.I would say that the screenplay didn't play favorites.

Topaz has none of the glamour or excitement of the James Bond pictures nor does it even have much of a happy ending. The master spy Davereaux (Frederick Stafford) uses and gratuitously sacrifices the lives of his underlings to uncover information that merely serves to confirm other spy information that the Americans have already gathered. Davereaux appears to find his job particularly distasteful, but at the same time he goes ahead with his mission with a stoicism that could easily be confused for coldness. If you consider Davereaux's demeanour at the end of the picture and the flashback to all the casualties that he leaves behind, you'll see what I mean.So Topaz is an austere and dark film. The brief torture scene has to be one of the most brutal moments ever depicted in any of Hitchcock's films, which for all their suspense usually spare the audience the horror of having to see uncompromising, graphic violence (Psycho and Frenzy, of course, are important exceptions). Lastly Topaz is also a surprisingly realistic film, in that the spies do not lead happy, glamorous lives, but are forced to perform very distasteful tasks that would drive a normal, decent person to despair.

With police getting suspicious and Bruno on his back, can Guy do the unthinkable? Well there is no doubt the premise is fresh and exhilarating boosted by Robert Walker's character with casual yet mean qualities. But it is quite incomprehensible the way the script turned out to be.

They often lagged forever and I never really listened to the lyrics. I got very bored, very fast. Then in my junior year of high school, my friends pushed me at the last minute to audition for my school's production of Cabaret and I ended up getting a small role. I started to fall in love with the genre and the following year, I landed the male lead (Professor Henry Higgins) in their production of a show that's considered to be one of the greatest musicals of all time, My Fair Lady. The experience changed me and really made me appreciate the process that goes into making one.The first time I watched Singin' in the Rain was for an assignment. I could not believe what I had been missing. Everyone knows the famous title sequence where Gene Kelly, Donald O' Connor and Debbie Reynolds are walking towards the camera in yellow slickers and holding umbrellas as well as singing the title song. This may seem cheesy for many and may be a huge turn off if all you know about the film is this and Gene Kelly's infamous Singin' in the Rain number. It's so iconic that I practically walked into the scene when I went on The Great Movie Ride in Disneyworld. This is the musical that works for people who aren't even a big fans of musicals.What is it that makes this film so great? The level of talent that the three leads possessed back then is more than the biggest stars in Hollywood today. Gene Kelly plays the likable and charming Don Lockwood in a role that was basically made for him. He effortlessly makes song and dance look like anyone can do it, but Kelly has been dancing since childhood. He is not a show off however; the first thing I wanted to do (and I'm sure everyone wants to do but never actually does) after seeing the film is sign up for tap dancing lessons. He and Donald O' Connor make dancing look like it's the greatest job in the world, such as in their Moses Supposes number. O' Connor provides a lot of comic relief and is a likable personality all his own. Many people underestimate his big Make Em' Laugh song which is one of the better numbers in the film.This brings me to my next point there are no bad numbers in Singin' in the Rain. I'll repeat that there are no bad numbers in Singin' in the Rain. Each number with it's fusion of song, dance and innovative creativity is never boring to watch. The same rules apply for the scenes, Kelly and co-director Stanley Donen have created several little witty moments and gags which are associated with the genre of musicals. The big rule with musicals is that you have to accept how unrealistic they are and Singin' in the Rain is no exception but even so, most audiences will embrace this. For example, the unscripted facial expressions of Cosmo Brown. Big kudos also go to actress Jean Hagen who plays the villainess Lina Lamont. Although an unlikable character, Hagen succeeds at making her very humorous.There's a reason this film is considered to be one of the greatest of all time, but to understand the magic of why it is you'll have to see it for yourself.

They often lagged forever and I never really listened to the lyrics. I got very bored, very fast. Then in my junior year of high school, my friends pushed me at the last minute to audition for my school's production of Cabaret and I ended up getting a small role. I started to fall in love with the genre and the following year, I landed the male lead (Professor Henry Higgins) in their production of a show that's considered to be one of the greatest musicals of all time, My Fair Lady. The experience changed me and really made me appreciate the process that goes into making one.The first time I watched Singin' in the Rain was for an assignment. I could not believe what I had been missing. Everyone knows the famous title sequence where Gene Kelly, Donald O' Connor and Debbie Reynolds are walking towards the camera in yellow slickers and holding umbrellas as well as singing the title song. This may seem cheesy for many and may be a huge turn off if all you know about the film is this and Gene Kelly's infamous Singin' in the Rain number. It's so iconic that I practically walked into the scene when I went on The Great Movie Ride in Disneyworld. This is the musical that works for people who aren't even a big fans of musicals.What is it that makes this film so great? The level of talent that the three leads possessed back then is more than the biggest stars in Hollywood today. Gene Kelly plays the likable and charming Don Lockwood in a role that was basically made for him. He effortlessly makes song and dance look like anyone can do it, but Kelly has been dancing since childhood. He is not a show off however; the first thing I wanted to do (and I'm sure everyone wants to do but never actually does) after seeing the film is sign up for tap dancing lessons.

Before I get into details I must say the first half of this film was pretty enjoyable. Lets start off with the acting, why do I even bother for the horror movie reviews. Its what you would expect from a 80's horror film, which is pretty much all the same. I didn't find my self caring for the characters, especially after what they did. The first forty or so minutes were enjoyable, there was some suspense, it was entertaining enough. Once night falls so does the film. The screen got so dark I couldn't even tell what was happening, felt like I was watching Avp-R. The chase scene went on for way too long, it would pick up then fall flat and repeat. No gore? okay I can live with that. The characters were so forgettable I actually didn't notice which character was absent and doing the murders. I thought this film would have been better but it failed in the last half.Recommended to anyone interested in 80's horror, if you don't mind looking at a dark screen.
