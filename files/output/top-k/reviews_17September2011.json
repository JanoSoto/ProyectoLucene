The Matrix has one of the best uses of CGI, visual effects, special effects and slow motion sequences I have ever seen in a movie. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Ann Moss are definitely at the top of their game in this CGI and visual effects spectacle. Hugo Weaving was absolutely brilliant in his role as the lead agent. He has such a great charisma, face, and voice. All of them make his character so vicious and intimidating. He is just an amazing actor. Keanu Reeves role in this movie is by far the best since his role in the movie Speed. The story is told brilliantly. Another thing that makes this movie so brilliant is the martial arts sequences. This movie will blow your mind.

It terrified a whole host of young school children, who couldn't keep themselves from watching it. It thrilled all those teenagers who had never seen anything like this before. And it even entertained all the adults too. And yet, here we are in the 21st century, almost 20 years later, and this movie is still wildly popular. Almost everyone has seen it and most people love it. Why? I'll offer a few reasons.Firstly, the characters. The characters are all interesting and most are unpredictable (except the lawyer). What is so intriguing about them all is that they are depicted as fairly normal people. And yet, O what awaits them! Richard Attenborough is excellent as John Hammond and Sam Neill is the perfect choice for Alan Grant. Jeff Goldblum was also a great choice as the total opposite to Grant and Laura Dern is the attractive - but not provocative - Ellie Sattler. So the cast and characters are perfect. I don't think I've ever seen a movie with such a well selected group of actors for their roles. They clash because they're all so strong; and yet they are forced to unite to save each other from the dinosaurs.Secondly, the plot. The plot is really imaginative (even if it's seriously fictional). The story line is presented in such a way that you are almost led to believe that this is possible. And depending on who you are, the film seems to meet your desires. The kids watch it for the dinosaurs; the adults want a bit of terrifying action. Well, you get what it says on the tin.Thirdly, the music. What memorable music! John Williams wrote the theme tune and it is certainly one of the best theme tunes he's ever done. It's the iconic 90s soundtrack. 'Titanic' cannot hold a candle to it.And finally (for now) the special effects. This film is spell-binding in it's movie effects. Every proper film-lover takes the work of the special effects in 'Jurassic Park' very seriously. They were ground- breaking effects. Certainly when the T-Rex comes onto the scene, you are absolutely blown away with the realism!Overall, it is right up there with the top 10 best films of the 90s. It's certainly one of my favourites. I've seen it about 6 or 7 times and it's always enjoyable. I would go so far as to say that if ever there was a movie made especially for the cinema, this is it. Hence why now in 2011, they want to re-release it in cinemas in the UK for a limited time only. Can't wait. It's going to blow us all away once again.

Is that really true? Yes and no. I appreciate what it had done for the genre, but it suffers greatly from characters that are uninteresting and scenes that aren't interesting either. I have never been able to see the appeal in this movie. It is good, but it isn't as good as they say. Let's get one thing straight. I used to be a HUGE UFO buff. I studied them, read books about them, and have stared into blank space for hours just thinking about them. Of course, most of that is in my past, yet I am still a believer and I can easily tell you that Close Encounters of the Third Kind is supposedly based on a true event of an alien craft landing at an air-force base that has been communicating with the U.S. government for a long time planning out their voyage of bringing humans to their home-world. It may sound like I am insane, but I have studied all of this kind of stuff. And believe it or not, this movie was SO similar to those certain events that Spielberg was almost forced to have the movie not released. Again, I am not joking. If you ever meet the man in real life, just ask him. He has even talked about it.Close Encounters of the Third Kind is a movie about wonder, an obsession, and secrets and just how long things can be kept secret. If someone is so determined to discover the difference between reality and what is fake, is it possible to find the truth with enough determination and team work from you and many people of the same common goal? How long is it okay to keep something secret if it is destroying the lives of others? Are the people obsessed with finding the truth really care about the truth? Once they find the truth, what then? Go home? What can learning the truth gain if it just means a huge risk of causing harm to you and your loved ones? Close Encounters mainly deals with those kind of themes, yet, it doesn't really do a good job of tightly rapping up those themes.I don't want to delve into too much plot, but because of many UFO sightings, many people's lives are changing. Not in one area. Not in one city. But the world. People are gathering to discover the meaning of these sightings. Are they a blessing or a menace? Are our obsessions worth striving for if it destroys you and the people around you? So just what exactly is wrong with Close Encounters? For starters, the characters are intriguing, but don't do enough to pull me in for over 2 hours and they run out of steam a bit fast and so does the plot. It drags on too much. The filler may provide some more atmosphere, but it doesn't help when it is not very interesting.I do not hate Close Encounters at all. I just think it is a good movie that is a bit overrated. That is my review and I give this movie a 7 out of 10.
