[{"date":"27 May 2011","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" 'Bowfinger' pleasantly surprised me. Since the cast included the likes of Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, Christine Baranski and Heather Graham, I was expecting to laugh but I wasn't expecting something satirical. It's much cleverer than the average Hollywood comedy. It exposes a lot of the less-spoken-about truth that happens behind the making of a Hollywood film and does so with a sensible sense of humour. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments and they linger long after the film has ended. I found myself randomly chuckling at the memory of the some of the scenes. Frank Oz has done a brilliant job here. I liked how he stays on track and doesn't go outrageously overboard with his plot devices, like his realistic use of the Kit-look-a-like. Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, Christine Baranski, Jamie Kennedy, Adam Alexi-Malle and Heather Graham form an excellent and hilarious team. They're all spot on in their delivery. Graham's Daisy echoes the stereotype of a small town girl doing anything to influence the cast and crew to climb the ladders of stardom and Baranski's Carol echoes that of a has-been who has managed to remain dignified without resorting to tragedies like alcoholism or drugs. I only thought Robert Downey Jr. was wasted in a tiny role. To sum it up, 'Bowfinger' is a movie that I didn't know I wanted to see. I wouldn't mind a revisit in the future.
