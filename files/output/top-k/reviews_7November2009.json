While schlock directors like Ed Wood, Arch Hall and Al Adamson can make really bad films, their budgets are minuscule. Here, however, with a big budget the producers show that they can produce a film every bit as bad. That's a great great return on your money, folks! This is also one of those films whose concept is so bizarre and dumb you wonder how it ever got made in the first place. First, considering how much of an enormous box office bomb the previous version of KING KONG was, you'd be amazed to see this this is a sequel! Second, the entire idea just makes no sense at all. This sequel begins as you see Kong falling to his death at the end of KING KONG (1976). But, despite falling a bazillion stories AND being machine gunned repeatedly, KING KONG LIVES expects us to accept that the giant ape DID NOT DIE!!! And, here's the weirdest part folks, some evil rich guy has been paying to keep the ape on life support in a warehouse for a decade!!! Why?!? This NEVER is explored in the least. And, after the nasty simian destroys New York, this guy has the idea of trying to revive this beast!?!In contrast to the evil industrialist (and aren't they all in these sort of films?!), you have the dedicated people (the doctor who saved Kong and the man who discovered a female Kong) who want to save the ape and return it to the wild--sort of like that kid from ET. And, when the military comes into the film, you KNOW that they are evil and only want to kill. So, it's the two innocent idiots who have to battle the unfeeling idiots who want to kill Kong and his new lady love (yes, folks, there are now TWO giant apes in this film). So, despite Linda Hamilton (who really seems to have a thing for big hairy guys) and some other jerk armed only with pluck, they are able to sneak past a bazillion idiot soldiers and the forces of the evil idiot rich dude...and save the day. In the process, the cars and trucks of the evil rich dude inexplicably run into each other and instantly explode in flames--thus enabling the apes and the only two who understand and care to escape. One of my favorite awful scenes was right after this when the male and female apes escape. They are now in the wild and are at a place called Honeymoon Ridge--at which place, naturally, the now adorable aminals start cooing and falling in love! Oh, this is stupid and I couldn't help but groan...and laugh. And, when the two ape-lovers happen upon them, guy what happens next?! Yes, they, too, are smitten and inspired by the apes' pure and innocent love! A short time later, the evil military mess up this perfect love and manage to gas the female ape to sleep. This works very, very well. So, when Kong shows up a minute later, they barely even try to put him to sleep as well but throw bombs and stuff at him--and really ticking him off in the process. Why didn't they also just put Kong to sleep as well and transport them to a sanctuary or a zoo or to Disney's Animal Kingdom?! So, given that the two lovers are separated, is what happens next really much of a surprise?! However, I was surprised to see that Kong survived by hiding out and eating alligators--and later, even people. The ape appears to be a giant gorilla--and gorillas are vegetarians. Also, the forest where Kong and Mrs. Kong hied out appears to be some place like Idaho or Colorado. Which begs the question what are giant rubber alligators doing in this part of the United States?!?.Now I noticed that this movie won a Razzie award for its special effects and I actually think this is unfair. The ape suits were not that bad and the special effects are actually the best thing about this terrible film. I do agree with the Razzie book (which I own) that it is a great movie to see because it is so laughably bad, but the award seemed misplaced. To have given an award for writing, directing or even acting would have seemed a lot more appropriate because of the silly lovemaking that occurred between the apes--now THAT was dumb! But the costumes weren't that bad for 1986 (other than Baby Kong's--whose was truly terrible). Also, in the film's defense, while the film was 100% stupid, it looked good--with good camera-work and decent effects. But, at heart, despite this, it was still incredibly dumb. And, speaking of the love of two apes, apparently the two apes can meet, have sex and have a baby all in the space of a day or two. Wow, those giant apes work fast!! And, with no amniotic fluid, placenta or mess whatsoever!! And, oddly, the baby turns out to be about the size of a normal gorilla--making me wonder who the father REALLY was!!! Apparently, Mrs. Kong was quite the slut! By the way, apparently the people inside the Mr. and Mrs. Kong's outfits were both guys. This makes the amazing childbirth scene all the more amazing!!!Oh, and the only good scene in the entire dreadful film involves Kong ripping some dumb redneck in half and then eat another. It's dumb but kinda cool as well. Although, it's pretty sad if this is the BEST thing the film has to offer! It's also interesting because the ape only appears to eat bad people--despite man chances to eat others, it only eats these rednecks who deserved it!

Charlton 'cold, dead hands' Heston plays George Taylor, an astronaut, part of a team placed in cryogenic suspension for exploratory purposes. When they are awoken, the ship is in distress and crash lands on an unknown planet. The survivors struggle from the craft before it sinks beneath the ocean waves and find themselves on a desolate world, barren, apparently lifeless. Lifeless, that is, until they encounter a primitive race, somewhat similar to humans, though without the gift of language. Suddenly, they are attacked by soldiers on horseback. Soldiers that are, quite literally, apes. Heston is taken prisoner and, from there, it is all about his attempts to convince the monkey overlords of the world that he is not merely a beast, but a thinking, sentient creature, deserving of both freedom and respect. Inevitably, those in charge take some convincing, eager as they are to maintain the status quo and reluctant as they are to acknowledge that humans can be thought of as anything but dumb animals.Considering that this movie is now more than forty years old, the visuals have to be seen to be believed. The simian suits and masks are a revelation, being mobile and full of expression, and even the spacecraft in the ocean and THAT final scene is breathtaking. Sumptuously directed, with real flair, this only drops a mark due to the loss of momentum as the dialogue does become slightly repetitive as the message of the movie is slammed home.A genuine sci-fi classic, with one of the most iconic endings going, this is essential viewing.

Steve was only 24 at the time and was in the process of making a comeback in the forthcoming 1976 Montreal Olympics to both face and defeat the Flying Finn Lasse Viren, Pat Porter,in rematch of their sensational race in the Munich Olympics back in the summer of 1972. It was Viren who defeated Steve back in 1972 in the terror filled Munich Olympics where 11 Israeli athletes were murdered by their Arab kidnappers.In the film Without Limits we get to see how Steve pushed himself to the absolute limits in order to win.

Never looking for fame or fortune Steve only wanted to prove to himself and those who watched him preform-as well as participated against him-on the track that he was by far the best there was and ever will be in the field of middle to long distance running. The most fitting tribute for Steve was given at his memorial service by his tearful coach Bill Bowerman who finally, at the Munich Olympics which Steve lost, realized what a unique person as well as athlete Steve really was What Steve thought me is that the real purpose of winning a race isn't winning.

This movie is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to immediate gratification. It works very well. This is perhaps the most absurd movie-related comment I have ever seen, but it very succinctly explains the warped perspective of many who hold the opinion that films such as this (as well as M*A*S*H, A Man Called Horse, and Bullet to Beijing) offer high-quality action set pieces. The illogic goes something like this A blurry set of camera frames that are impossible to follow qualifies as a great action scene. The problem with this perspective is that ANYONE &#x96; even the most inept movie-maker on the planet &#x96; can make such a scene fairly easily. The million dollar question now arises How can one claim the greatness of action that requires virtually no effort whatsoever to create? Why, then, do I give this film a 10 out of 10 instead of a 1 or 2? Simple. There are pieces of action scenes that show promise. In those rare instances when I could follow what was actually happening, the choreography was good. Unfortunately, these bits of promise were interrupted by inept camera-work that is usually invoked when the movie-maker is too lazy to painstakingly map out fight scenes or brainstorm over fresh combinations of moves and maneuvers. In other words, it's a cheap, pathetic method of film-making that covers up the low quality nature of the action at hand. Therefore, Coppola made it easy on himself by lowering the bar to such an extent that fighting sequences will only require a marginal amount of choreography.The camera-work in this film is simply one of the worst I have ever seen. While watching the opening action sequence, for instance, I literally felt like vomiting when exposed to back-and-forth rapid-fire framing that necessitates a warning on the front of the DVD that this film may induce epileptic seizures.Finally, the plot line was horrible and the cinematography sub par for a movie made in the late 90s.

His character is basically just reactionary. He's an unsympathetic creep who treats his girlfriend, cleverly played by Karen Black, with disdain. We understand later that he was a gifted pianist who had been raised in an upper class musically prominent family. His sister, father and brother all have pursued and acquired careers in music as he has left the family tradition with indifference. This movie is indicative of the late 60's and early 70's era in which films were trying to exhume naturalism and raw honesty from characters. But to today's standards they look like parodies of what they thought realism was. A number of scenes come to mind such as the Diner scene where Jack goes into a rage against a starchy waitress. This scene is completely out of sync from the rest of the film. In reality this scene appeared too over the top. Waitresses today would normally just retreat and tell the manager. But this makes it appear as if we are having a showdown that would highly unlikely escalate to such an embarrassment. The women would hardly be as accepting to such aggressive behavior. There are other scenes that just seem to ramble on where we get minimal dialogue and have to guess what the characters are doing or thinking. The hitchhiker woman spewing her disgust with society gets relentless and overplayed to a nuisance. The scene where all those intellectuals corroborating over modern psychology in his father's home is unrealistic as well. It looks too staged. When Jack chastises the woman for acting superior it is just too overdone. Yelling at someone in a fireside setting without any significant reaction from others is too weird and doesn't lead anywhere except to viewer aggravation. My biggest qualm would be to the performance of Ms. Aspach. Her performance really bothered me and I think she lacks depth as an actress. As the 70's came near acting changed and you can see it in Five easy Pieces. All the characters seem to have a purpose except for Bobby (Jack Nicholson). He is an unhappy man with a chief feature of being a tramp. He goes and leaves only to avoid his personal problems, but he cannot capitalize or utilize his musical talents in a prosperous way. His admission to his father that he never felt he was a good musician may be self-denial or the truth. But we never really know.

What or who would give birth to such a thing?This is something that Director Richard Donner and Writer David Seltzer tried to convey in one of horrors most astonishing and shocking movies The Omen, a movie about the child Antichrist and his family, the  prophecies surrounding said child and who if at all can stop him.Robert Thorn(Gegory Peck) and his wife Katherine Thorn(Lee Remick), have a child, on the morning of June 6th at 6 AM, the child is not alive, he only breathes only once, Robert Thorn is told this by the kindly Father Spiletto(Martin Benson), but he is told there is another child whose mother died in child birth at the same time. The child has no family to go to and the hospital is willing to let the Thorns go home with it and the mother need never know. The child's name is Damien (Harvey Stphens, his only role until the 2006 remake in which he makes a small cameo), the thorns adopt him as their ownFast forward five years, strange things have been happening with Damien all his life, he is no normal child, and he is about to celebrate his fifth birthday, the young Nanny(Holly Palance, whom they give no actual name to the role for) is attached to Damien so much so that she will not give him to his mother when she is asked, reluctantly she does, and this sets off events in the movie that are highly disturbingA lot of people complain about the movie not being horror, to me it is horror but not gory, as were many that came out during the seventies and early eighties an era of horror that I think is the Golden age of it or the resurgence of it, because these years gave rise to many franchises that are known today, including The Omen, The Exorcist, and the list goes on. These were the years that horror really shined before a lot of the bad acting gore and sex interrupted it. The Omen is an example of psychological horror at its best, from its cast which includes Grgory Peck, whom is best known for his role in this film and the TV miniseries The Blue and the Grey as President Lincoln which chronicles the US Civil war. The only sad thing about this aside from a lot of the bad things that happened on set is that Harvey Stephens never went on to really shine and I'm sorry but the kid had a career before him.I like this movie because of the fact that it has no blood or gore, all of the scares are in the mind, and yes I will admit I will watch a gory film just look at the Saw series one of my personal favorites! This is the way that horror should be done, and had been done; this movie alone is a shining example of a mind freaking film. I highly recommend the original Omen for anybody who loves good psychological horror.

Both, the novel and the film are set in upper class New York City in the 1870s.The Age of Innocence is the movie that proves once again what a versatile talented, unpredictable, incredibly passionate, and artistically outstanding director Martin Scorsese is. Recently I saw for the first time Scorsese's comedy After Hours and was fascinated how masterful he was in creating a darkly funny surreal comedy. Now, after re-watching The Age of Innocence, I am sure that Scorsese has made one of the most beautiful, tragic, passionate, sensual, sexually charged screen romances ever, which is at the same time perfectly suitable for the whole family watching. It is PG rated, and the characters speak in refined, almost forgotten English. The director himself described The Age of Innocence as the most violent film he's ever made, clearly referring to the inner turmoil, disappointment and resignation the two main characters of this drama go through.The material world Scorsese created and paints with his lenses is of incredible beauty. Michael Ballhaus' camera brings out the perfection of craftsmanship of every object it looks at be it the costumes (Oscar statuette for Gabriella Pescucci who has dressed the heroes of The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988), Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), Der Name der Rose (1986), and Upon a Time in America (1984) to name a few), china, crystal, silver, flower arrangements, jewelry or furniture. The exquisite meals looked delicious and required a special food consultant who was mentioned in the film's credits. Or take for example these elegant leather ladies gloves with small buttons. Who would think that unbuttoning a glove on the hand of a beautiful woman slowly, tenderly, makes one of the most erotic scene ever filmed? The people who inhabited this world of beauty, comfort, and privilege seem the perfect happy creatures but not all is so perfect in the paradise. Two beautiful passionate people found love that could only happen once in a life time but the strict norms or society they live in and the unbending unwritten rules based on convention and hypocrisy they must obey won't permit them to follow their hearts freely, to fulfill their desire, and to be happy in that Age of Innocence. The cast is superb, and includes Daniel Day-Lewis, the film protagonist Newland Archer, Michelle Pfeiffer, as Countess Olenska, a woman with a Past who stole his heart, and very young Winona Ryder, May Welland, the girl whom Archer will marry. 22 years old Ryder very deservingly received the Oscar nomination for her performance. I would like to mention Joanne Woodward's subtle narrating of Edith Wharton's prose which is one of the high points of the film. IMO, the film has only high points and is Martin Scorsese's fine (perhaps, the finest) and stunning achievement.

Before it came to the screen, most dark thrillers and dramas didn't delve into the mind and the details that cause people to think and do the things we usually see them do. Here, Ingrid Bergman plays a young woman moving back into the house where she found her aunt dead and soon starts to hear and see things no one else seems to. Could she be losing her mind? Bergman is one of the greatest actresses of all time and it is well-known that the key to any of her performances was her eyes. Watching her in Casablanca or Notorious or here, her eyes are constantly roaming up and down the person opposite her as well as all over the set. It is especially effective here as it gives a sense of claustrophobia and unsettling nerves. Her wild eyes help offset her beautiful face, making her seem more believable as a woman fearing she is going mad than just some love-struck dumb beauty. And although he didn't win an Oscar for his role as Bergman did, Charles Boyer is very understated as the husband who certainly has an evil bearing in mind and seems to push his wife to the brink. Joseph Cotten is wonderful as well but he is horribly underused as an American-sounding detective from Scotland Yard who has a strange fascination with Bergman's case.One of the best things about Gaslight is the fact that it shows director George Cukor's ability to go outside his usual sophisticated comedies and melodramas and make a bleak, moody thriller focusing more on the psychological aspects of the main character than the physical actions. It also features a very young Angela Landsbury as a housemaid with a Cockney accent and a saucy demeanor. It certainly isn't perfect and the ending is rather unusual, but there are some quietly effective moments thanks to Bergman, and Cukor's wandering camera and harsh lighting provide great mood and setting for a very well-made thriller.

If I LOVE a movie for whatever inherent reason and can see something in it every time I see it that makes me appreciate it even more, essentially, I stand by my rating. And if I'm ever in doubt that I'm doing the right thing, it is a movie like this, HIGHLANDER (1986), that puts all doubts to rest! I first saw HIGHLANDER way back not long after it came out in 1986. I was watching it late on Saturday night on cable and when it was over, I felt like I had just seen something special. Couldn't put my finger on it, exactly, just KNEW I loved what I had just seen. To this day, I stand by my initial instincts! HIGHLANDER is one of the most purely entertaining low budget films ever made! HIGHLANDER has got EVERYTHING in it and going for it...an absurdly convoluted yet confidently executed story and plot...a strong cast that grabs hold an maintains your attention throughout...an ominous, apocalyptic tone...energetic, convincing action scenes...a surprisingly solid script...and last, but not least, a pulse-pounding rock score by 80s iconic music group Queen! HIGHLANDER starts off in modern day New York in Madison Square Garden. Among the spectators is a mysterious man lying in wait for a swordfight with another man.

After all, even the heavily lambasted 1999 remake of The Haunting had an impressive look going for it. William Malone's remake of House on Haunted Hill, however, is filmed in dreary colors and murky darkness, and takes place on some of the grungiest and unpleasant looking set-pieces, that it just might be the ugliest looking horror movie of 1999. It's also lazily written, laughably unscary, and downright boring to boot. The story here is pretty much the same as in the original An amusement park impresario (Geoffry Rush) invites six strangers to the titular house in celebration of his no good wife's (Famke Janssen) birthday. Each guest will win a million dollars if they stay the night and, of course, if you survive the night. The movie opens up with a glaring lapse in logic, as not only do we see a video tape display real footage of graphic violence, nudity, and rape on public television, but a few seconds later, we learn that the tape was supposedly burned in a fire, so how the producers got ahold of the footage is anyone's guess. It gets better. The Janssen character plays a trick on her husband that involves her receiving electroshock therapy until she's dead. The plot is too convoluted to get into here, and is too ridiculous for me to care to explain it all. The images in this movie make no sense, as there are flashes of Hellraiser type demons that don't seem to fit in the movie at all, and the characters are the same batch of horror movie doofuses who are constantly make dumb decisions, like wandering through the house alone. There is one pretty nifty sequence involving a camcorder picking up some ghostly activity, but other than that, House on Haunted Hill is dull, dead in the water, and easily one of the very worst movies of 1999.

Hollywood has strived to put to film, books which depict the future. Some of their efforts are dreary, others are black and still many other are deadly and violent. This movie is called  Rollerball.  Originally a futuristic short-story written by William Harrison entitled 'Roller ball Murder' it morphed into a cinematic story of World domination by Corportate Executives. Accordingly, it became the story of a player named Jonathan E. (James Caan) Over the last decade, since he joined the Huston team, Jonathan has not only become very popular, but has become a national hero, in an era where Individualism and hero worship are not only discouraged, but frowned upon. Nearing the end of the season and his tenth year with the team he is summoned by Bartholomew (John Houseman) the C.E.O of the Corporate World, to discuss his retirement. He is reminded, the game is not designed to produce heroes, but the opposite. Opting to negotiate his retirement, the player states he wants his wife Ella (Maud Adams) back, whom he was forced to divorce. Bartholomew cannot deliver her yet reminds the player the game will be changed to force his retirement.
