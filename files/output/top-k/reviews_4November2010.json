[{"date":"4 November 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" When an alien force attempts to invade Earth, they travel back to the 21st century, pursued by the Enterprise. The plan appears to be to prevent first contact, meaning, the first time creatures from outer space directly revealed themselves to us and it could be proved. If this did not happen, our planet would be easy for them to take. And that's not all. It's no ordinary species we're up against. The Borg have returned(if you don't know what that means, don't jump directly to this, *watch Next Gen to find out*)! This time, they get a Queen(portrayed sensually and impeccably by Krige), and while that is arguably going against the idea of no individuality, it gives them more to work with, and they *deliver*. We get fantastic character moments; the focus remains on Picard(who pulls a Captain Ahab... and is a bit of an action hero) and Data(could this mix of synthetic and organic be the answer to his wish to become human?), but they do very interesting things with them. The acting is spot-on for most concerned, including the delightful cameos(I won't spoil them for you). This can be pretty funny, if also sometimes silly. The writing is marvelous. This is well-paced, it never loses your attention. It is a proper movie, not an episode stretched to feature length; the stakes are high, and this has plenty of tension, cool battles and exciting sequences. All of the FX are great, not only the CGI courtesy of ILM. As when he directed TNG, we can tell that Frakes knows what he's doing. There is a bit of disturbing content and mild violence in this. The DVD comes with a trailer and a teaser. I recommend this to any Star Trek fan. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 November 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" When an alien force attempts to invade Earth, they travel back to the 21st century, pursued by the Enterprise.

Michael comes back (again). OK, this guy has been stabbed a lot, shot numerous times, french fried in fires, crushed by boulders, blown up, run over by cars and trucks, fallen from heights, flushed down toilets, been forced to watch Tom Cruise marathons, and so on. And he's always back for more. Yet dopey cops and vigilantes try to fight him; hello there; he's kind of indestructible you guys. Like a bogey man creature. That makes money for movie producers every time he shows up. You might have trouble killing him, you know? I know, I'm wasting my breath. Horror movie extras are dumb. And suicidal.So he still wants to croak his sister. And anybody that's anywhere near her. Or if they're cops. Or if they're teens who forever laugh about him. Or a couple on a date that say stupid stuff. Any of that sound familiar? He robotically saunters around a town that everybody probably would have moved out of by now if they had any brain power. But nobody does, especially whoever concocted this mess. Mikey still has his trusty knife, and doesn't say much. Sometimes he likes to stand there a while before killing somebody. Sometimes he does a jump scare murder to wake you up. If you just want to see blood spraying around, there's plenty of that. At all times, the acting makes the kills almost seem merciful to the audience. There's a pitiful attempt to showcase Michael's world, and that goes predictably nowhere. Nothing new, just endless horror movie clichés.Michael is currently hunting down the people responsible for this movie.
