However, Formula One wouldn't allow the access that it did for Grand Prix in 1966, so the director defaulted to the North American CART series.  CART allowed unprecedented access to its venues, races, paddock, announcers, drivers, sponsors, etc.  But this movie fails in that it is nothing more than an auto racing cliché.  As a fan, it's hard to rebuff the blood sport aspect of the sport to those who are not fans.  The crashes are incredibly unrealistic, some of the tracks are non-existent and the drivers are paper thin.  The scene near the swimming pool with the blonde vixen doing some sort of goofy water aerobics is pathetic.  The part where Jimmy Bly steals a car (that happens to be filled with fuel indoors and doesn't need an external starter to run) and drives it through the Chicago streets with Stalone in tow is just ridiculous.

A movie about the excitement of the series, the strategy, the action and the pageantry of racing could have boosted the series back to national respectability.

I didn't really know how funny this would be because something the Powers series was becoming known for with the second installment Recycled jokes. Yes, Goldmember has some recycled jokes, plenty of them, but at least the film identifies this in the Osbournes scene. I expected the characters to be more tired than in the previous installment, and indeed they were. Fans of the series will probably still enjoy some of the moments with Scott, Mini-Me, Fat Bastard, etc. The story has it's crazy take over the world idea, but it still could have remembered this series started as a Bond-series spoof. Dr. Evil is more insane and, while a bit tired, is still rather funny, especially the Silence of the Lambs spoof when Mini-Me and Evil go to prison. It has a a friggin funny take on the song 'Hard Noc Life' that will no doubt be dated sooner rather than later. The new character Goldmember wasn't too funny, pretty much falls flat. No matter what, Myers has to be given props for playing 4 different characters, but at the same time 4 is maybe one too many....New female love interest Foxxy Cleopatra was OK at best, certainly nothing great and I found both Vanessa and Felicity to be better. Michael Caine is a different story though, he was funny and brought some freshness with his character. The only thing I didn't like that much was the ending, too tie everything up neat and happy, though I enjoy what happens to the character of Scott. Getting a bit dated and stale, but still an entry into the series a bit behind the second. I'd say Myers needs to fresh up the franchise though if they continue with a fourth one.

There may be movies which just slap together a lot of artsiness for the sake of seeming artsy and don't put any thought into the story whatsoever, but this is not one of those movies.I've been chewing over the movie since I saw it and there are DEFINATELY clues to making sense of it. Not that I claim to understand everything, but I've definately got a handle on it. The thing is, Lynch was forced to pack an entire storyline for a season (or several) of TV into a two-hour movie. Most directors would wrap up plotlines, find some kind of resolutions for the character arcs, drop stuff that was incidental and would have been resolved later, etc. What Lynch chose to do--I think--was instead to develop the entire THEME of the series, and treated the characters and subplots as merely a means to an end. Nobody in this movie gets an ending, except for Diane, but the basic progression of ideas and images seems to fit together quite completely. He's telling a story of emotions that progress the way they have to, instead of having them play out according to the plot. He even throws out linear time and has the movie circle back on itself, because it's in keeping with the theme.It's really just the story of a girl who comes to Hollywood with tons of potential, is passed over, and has her dreams crushed. I mean, that's really it. Everything else is just incidental to that, or a way of making the point in a wierd way. For instance, the girl who has her dreams crushed is not the same girl who came to town (literally). Then you have a girl with amnesia and a director who's fighting to remain true to his ideals by casting the girl he WANTS to cast, at the same time that Betty comes to town, naive and hopeful. Then the other girl gets her memory back and the director caves in, and Betty's dreams are crushed. Thematically, it all ties together. Logically, it's a bunch of random, incomplete plot threads. But that's in keeping with the dreamlike nature of the story.If you want 3-act movies where plots are wrapped up, you should know better than to rent David Lynch films. I mean, there's nothing wrong with loving a movie that tells its story in a more mainstream way, but don't talk about how it's more realistic. Forrest Gump's structure is no more realistic than this movie's. Life doesn't play out in three acts. But we're used to that in movies, so we accept it. This movie has different narrative rules, that's all. I guarantee that if you try to piece together the clues, you will find some measure of satisfaction. It's not just artistic w**king.

Goldmember is better equiped to blow away box office records than Dr. Evil's giant laser!I laughed so much I had to take off my Austin Powers glasses a few times to wipe the tears away.As a long time fan of the James Bond film series, I've always enjoyed the teasers each Bond film begins with.  Goldmember begins with a teaser better than any of the 20 Bond films.I own a copy of Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me, and I've watched it dozens of times.  My 11 year old son can even do impressions of Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard.  Thus, I took my boy and a friend of his along, and my son kept poking me because I was laughing so hard it was embarrassing him in front of his friend.  Look for Goldmember to set a new record for DVD sales.  I know I'll be watching it again and again.I was driving them home from the movie with my boy and his friend, and I said, Hey, that movie that Austin Powers was watching in the theater at the end of the movie was the same one Tom Cruise and Danny DeVito were filming at the beginning....They then both said, in unison, You JUST figured THAT out?!?I really see this movie as a stepping stone for Tom Cruise.  He sold that Yeah, baby line quite well, so be on the lookout for Tom Cruise to be in all-out comedy movies in the future--and not just ones that parody his status as an Action\/Adventure hero.While other critics may view the Goldmember character as disappointing, you have to realize the bind the writers were in.  I'm sure they would have loved to have made the character just like Auric Goldfinger--but if they tried that, the producers of the James Bond film series would have levied an injunction.

If they'd said, William Morris, everyone would have laughed, but when they used ICM, I was probably the only one in the audience who appreciated that one.There was also a moment when an image that looked like a pair of womens breasts appeared on the radar screen.

Austin Powers in Goldmember isn't just the best of that shagadellic franchise; it's Mike Myers best film ever.  Goldmember is better equiped to blow away box office records than Dr. Evil's giant laser!I laughed so much I had to take off my Austin Powers glasses a few times to wipe the tears away.As a long time fan of the James Bond film series, I've always enjoyed the teasers each Bond film begins with.  Goldmember begins with a teaser better than any of the 20 Bond films.I own a copy of Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me, and I've watched it dozens of times.  My 11 year old son can even do impressions of Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard.  Thus, I took my boy and a friend of his along, and my son kept poking me because I was laughing so hard it was embarrassing him in front of his friend.  Look for Goldmember to set a new record for DVD sales.  I know I'll be watching it again and again.I was driving them home from the movie with my boy and his friend, and I said, Hey, that movie that Austin Powers was watching in the theater at the end of the movie was the same one Tom Cruise and Danny DeVito were filming at the beginning....They then both said, in unison, You JUST figured THAT out?!?I really see this movie as a stepping stone for Tom Cruise.  He sold that Yeah, baby line quite well, so be on the lookout for Tom Cruise to be in all-out comedy movies in the future--and not just ones that parody his status as an Action\/Adventure hero.While other critics may view the Goldmember character as disappointing, you have to realize the bind the writers were in.  I'm sure they would have loved to have made the character just like Auric Goldfinger--but if they tried that, the producers of the James Bond film series would have levied an injunction.  The writers did the best they could given the circumstance.When we look at the Bond films, notice thisOf the Sean Connerys, the 4th one, Thunderball was the coolest one.Of the Roger Moores, the 4th one, Moonraker was the coolest one.While they've said that this film concludes the Austin Powers franchise, please bring Austin back for a 4th time for the cool one.As for the soundtrack, featuring Burt Bacharach and the others, I feel an Academy Award is in order.I especially enjoyed the reference that Robert Wagner made that while Doctor Evil was out in space, his resources had been used to create the talent agency ICM, which has A-list stars like Julia Roberts.ICM really is one of the Big 3 talent agencies.  If they'd said, William Morris, everyone would have laughed, but when they used ICM, I was probably the only one in the audience who appreciated that one.There was also a moment when an image that looked like a pair of womens breasts appeared on the radar screen.

There is no better setting for a suspense-filled epic than a submarine.  The claustrophobia, the incessant clanking of tons of water attacking the hull, the fast-paced action with which everyone must utilize in their duties, all of it adds to the mix.  This is even before we are given a story. \tOf course, in terms of this film, that story is based on actual events.  In 1961, as the US and USSR were on the brink of war, the Russians were busy testing their newly designed ballistic-class submarines.  The first of its kind, K-19, was to position itself within American range and fire a test missile giving us the same fears about the Russians that they had about us.  To say the very least, the mission is both a success and a complete failure from the getgo. \tTen people die before the ship even sets to sea.  The champagne bottle used to christen the ship does not break &#150; more of a superstitious discomfort than anything.  The ship's original captain (Liam Neeson) is demoted to executive officer.  Once the new captain arrives (Harrison Ford), the crew becomes even more uncomfortable.  None of this weighs in well when the ship is finally put to sea. \tDirected by Kathryn Bigelow (Point Break, Strange Days), K-19 The Widowmaker knows how to work its audience.  The director operates around the tense setting with ease, swinging the camera around these men running up and down tight hallways.  Of particular notice are the shots where we pan up from inside the submarine to the dark waters only a few feet past the steel walls.  Bigelow incorporates such a shot two or three times throughout the film, and each time it lets us know just how dangerous of a predicament these men are in.  The script by Louis Nowra and Christopher Kyle does a nice job of not dumbing itself down to the audience.  It has impressive character development &#150; we truly care about these men who are at war with us.  The way the film talks about nuclear war is equally striking.  The film makes you truly think about how they saw us during this time seeing as how we were the only country to ever actually drop a nuclear bomb on someone. However, through all of this, the story kind of plods along never revealing much more than we need to know.  Now, I said it does not dumb itself down, but more depth to the story of what the Russians really were trying to accomplish would not have been disregarded.  Instead, we are left to assume the motives that everyone has on and off the submarine.  It is only when the nuclear core onboard springs a leak and begins to heat up that the story kicks it into high gear. Something else that would have helped the film would have been a little bit of humor.  I mean, I know they are possibly out to start World War III, but a bit of wit here and there would not have hurt.  With all of the water trying to get in, it wouldn't have hurt to make the story a little less dry. Ford, playing the hard-edged captain who puts the mission before the men, once again puts in his two-cents worth as the bad-guy who's not so bad.  Digging up the muses he conjured up for The Mosquito Coast and What Lies Beneath, he casually hides behind a hard exterior that seems to only have one, grim expression.  This on top of his `now he has it now he doesn't' Russian accent, and you've got yourself a less than convincing job by one of today's greatest actors.  He didn't feel the part.  He didn't seem to care about the film that he was doing.  He just cashed his check, spoke his lines, and sat in his trailer thinking up ideas for Indiana Jones 4. If there is a worthwhile performance, it is Neeson who compellingly makes us believe the emotion his character has for these men.  They are his family, and, even though he is no longer the father, he can still take care of them.  Well, in terms of acting, Neeson takes care of his part, and, though it is difficult, he almost manages to hold up the rest of the show as well. K-19 The Widowmaker, much like the events that it is based on, is a sink or swim kind of film.  When it works, it works perfectly.  When it's off by little more than a bit, it just does not feel right.  To say the least, it is the kind of film that is hard to talk about.  It is not good enough to be passionate about it.  It is not bad enough to be sarcastic about it.

The material he had to work with was god awfull though and he would have really had to pull something off to make this film funny.  The jokes were poor, and the characters were poorly developed (if developed at all!) so there was little in the way of character centred, situation comedy laughs.  The comedy relied on tired 'I'm a nigger man' style jibes from a fast talking Chris Rock.

For gods sake, at one point the CIA implanted a device under Rock's ear so they could hear everything he could - however, the tracking device they put on Rock's car was larger than a frizby -=huge=- and was so loosely clipped on the underside that it dropped off when they went over a bump in the road! the terrorists on the other hand implanted a Global Positioning system into his phone using a microchip.  Oh god, I could go on, but there were so many stupid errors.This film isn't the worst ever, however it is dull.  It's crammed with ill thought out action scenes, has a very weak plot, and abjectly fails as a comedy.  The comedy fails so badly that they even drop it after about an hour and a half and revert to bad action.

At times Hopkins' performance livens things up but frankly he isn't that well suited to an action style role.  This was very similar in some ways to Enemy of The State, however, Hopkins was asked to do things they did not have Hackman doing.  Essentially particularly towards the end, Hopkins was asked to pull off the incredible role of the over 60's hardman role.  Hopkins at times cut an absurd figure fighting with a fit 20 year old terrorist on the outside of the car during a car chase. It was sad to see such a good actor so badly cast.Chris Rock... don't give up the comedy! His performance wasn't great, though to be fair it was far from awfull.  The material he had to work with was god awfull though and he would have really had to pull something off to make this film funny.  The jokes were poor, and the characters were poorly developed (if developed at all!) so there was little in the way of character centred, situation comedy laughs.  The comedy relied on tired 'I'm a nigger man' style jibes from a fast talking Chris Rock.  Suffice to say it doesn't really work, and particularly not in this setting since all the other characters were so unbelievebly staight laced and humourless.  The other characters bizzarely didn't even react to his jokes.  All in all the humour was a let down and the film was incredulous.The action was simply stupid and formulaic.

It's bad, but not so much that I will bother to remember why. For all its fancy sets and special effects, the final result is something that goes in one of the viewer's ears and out the other. The story revolves around a scientist of the 19th century who is horrified to witness his girlfriend's death in a random mugging. He then become obsessed with building a time machine, one that can take him into the past so he can set things right. It only takes him four years, surprisingly, but when he finally flips the switch and zips back to that exact moment in time, the woman dies in a different situation. Now, I don't know about you, but if I had spent all that time building a mother lovin' time machine, I would stand very still with the girl by my side, not walking off to get flowers but...anyway, science boy goes into the future to find out why the past could not be changed. Oddly enough, when he reaches the year 2020 (or something like that), no one knows about time travel. So what the movie's basically saying is that with his extremely limited technology, our hero built this machine, but hundreds of years and advancements later, not a single person has also found out the secret??? Maybe this would make more sense if we actually saw how he made the thing, but all we get is him writing out these long equations. Sheesh. Anyway, after spending about four minutes in this futuristic city, science boy travels ahead a few more years. Now the moon is breaking into pieces. Got that? Good, because we must move on at an unnecessarily lightning quick pace in this 90 minute blur. Now we are 800,000 years in the future, where the peaceful Eloi are being hunted by very dull puppet creatures. From here on in TTM is too much like the new Planet of the Apes, another movie that bored me. Another thing to note is that, again, 800,000 years from our hero's starting point, English is still around thanks to collected stones. Yeah, sorry, but I doubt those would have lasted for very long. There's about fifty more continuity problems in here, I'm sure, but it would take way too long to list them. Let's just say that The Time Machine is not worth anyone's time. How could it have been better? Let me suggestAct One We get to see the scientist actually MAKE the machine from scratch, with trial and error ensuing. And do we really need the love story to motivate him??? Why not just invent for the sake of invention?Act Two First successful trial of the machine, and we are in the near future. Here time travel could at least be acknowledged as a theory, and the scientist could show off his machine. Something could go wrong, and he goes 800,000 years into the future.Act Three The Eloi and Morlocks escapade. Again, no sappy love story with one of the pretty pretty Eloi. It's just too extraneous.

The scary element of a zombie movie is the way these monsters never relent until they've totally ripped apart their victim.  There is literally no blood or gore in this movie - no horror!  The effects of missing body parts might be nicely completed, but the zombie action is ultimately poor.  Does the audience really want to watch another average gung-ho Aliens rip off??The action itself isn't particularly spectacular either.  It's still amazing that these trained killers can't figure out that since body shots have no effect, a head shot might have more impact.  And it was unsurprising to see the introduction of a superbeast into the movie, to allow for a greater amount of pointless CGI.  Musically, they overdo it on the industrial metal front (an excuse for a tie in CD!!). More atmospherics and sparing using of the industrial metal would have been more effective!This movie is passable entertainment, but it just could have been so much more.  One can only imagine how different this movie would have been if George Romero had remained in charge.  Do yourself a favour, watch the classics (Night Of the Living Dead, Dawn Of the Dead, Day Of the Dead, Zombi 2, Evil Dead) rather than this average action movie!

With a film as popular as the original Men in Black, a sequel of some sort was guaranteed, the only question would be when, and whether it would be any good.  Five years later, it's come, and it's terrible.Men in Black II's biggest problem is its profound lack of originality. With the exception of a new villain, everything else is the same.  There are no new major agent characters, and the explanation for this phenomenon being so is lame.  The majority of the jokes are either directly ripped off from the first film or spin-offs or reversals of those jokes that aren't only incredibly stale, but not even slightly funny.  Since no new aliens other than the villains are added, and there is little of the Men in Black headquarters expanded on, there isn't even the wonder of new dazzling summer blockbuster special effects or fun alien characters provided by the first film.  The film's just so bland and boring, offering nothing that can't be found (for much cheaper) in an episode of Men in Black - the cartoon series.  When a cartoon shown before the feature and the intro to the film, a mock low-budget cheesy film, are more entertaining than the rest of the film, that's usually a bad sign.Even the actors in Men in Black II must have realized this, because they put no effort into their characters.  An opportunity for romance between Will Smith's J and a witness to an alien attack lacks both chemistry and screen time.  A hinted at reversed dynamic between J and Tommy Lee Jones' K, which (unlike the rest of the rehashed plot details) is somewhat interesting, is totally scrapped, leaving us with the exact same relationship as in the first film.  In an unsurprising event, Jackass' Johnny Knoxville shows in a lackluster co-starring villain role that not only are his 15 minutes long up, but that nobody even cares who he is if he's not trying to kill himself.  Were it not for Lara Flynn Boyle's Serleena, there'd be no laughs or interesting moments in the movie at all.Men in Black II is just sad.  The first movie wasn't great, but had parts that were enjoyable.  This is just a disappointing waste of time and money, which in due time will no doubt influence another, equally disappointing and uninspired Men in Black III.

I've read most of the comments on IMDB and don't disagree with any of the positive reviews.  I do, however, disagree with why people seem to think this is such a great film.  I too at one time wandered why I found ALIEN to be so fascinating.  Let me explain.Realism, realism, realism.  This movie takes an extremely unrealistic, over the top, and unbelievable story and makes it seem reasonable.  All the actors, unlike the acting in so many bad films, treat the storyline and movie events with such realism, it's stunning.  Unlike the film 2001, which I truly like, the spaceship in ALIEN is truly realistic.  In 2001 the spaceship is perfectly clean, and made for planetary research.  In ALIEN, the ship is a cargo mining ship; somewhat dirty and with a lived in look.  No matter what happens in ALIEN, whether it be an acid for blood man-eating space bug or a robot programmed to kill all human crewmembers; or a distress call from a planet with no indigenous life; the actors treat the events with perfect reality; the same way you and I are forced to do through every waking moment of our lives.  This is why people say they have watched the film many times, know what is going to happen next, and still jump out of their chairs at certain scenes.  It's the fact that Ridley Scott, as well as all the people involved in creating this masterpiece, have pulled off the most difficult task in quality film making; Realism.  The kind of realism, so intense, you can't move your eyes from the screen.  This movie could have been about anything, and I truly believe that people would find it just as good.  What people are enjoying so much are Directing and Acting coming together to form something never created before; realism so realistic, it's about an alien life, space travel and androids, and yet completely believable.As I mentioned earlier, I have seen this film many times.  Without question, more than any other film excluding TAXI Driver.  Although I find 25 or 30 films to be true masterpieces for probably 8 or 9 different reasons; ALIEN contains some type of aura, I call it realism but I am not 100% sure; I find ALIEN to be the most interesting type of entertainment that I have ever been privileged to experience.  Thank God for DVD's; I'm going to watch this film again; right now.  Too excellent to be rated by someone like me; I just don't contain enough brainpower.
