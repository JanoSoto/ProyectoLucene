It's bubble-gum\/popcorn\/no-brains mass-market and lowest common denominator fare. It's a pile of well marketed (and somewhat executed) drivel. Leave your brains behind for this one.Let's look at the things it did well first - Armageddon looks mostly pretty in terms of the visual effects - watch those cities get destroyed (although the New York one is extremely eerie). That's not surprising - when you have the likes of Jerry Bruckheimer producing it generally means a meaty budget. The movie is swiftly paced - you're launched immediately into the action and given little time to start thinking (because then you'd begin to savage it). The sound editing is also fairly spot on - sharp and crisp and generally well timed. And now for all the rest... I can't let the plot go by. It's completely and utterly ridiculous. The crew have gone on record as admitting that the science of the movie is a load of cobblers and it is - sound and fires in an area with no atmosphere, gravity where it shouldn't be, never ending count-downs, a weakly contrived solution to the asteroid problem... the list goes on and on. Memento it ain't.As the movie is fairly fast we're not meant to consider this (and apparently the movie producers felt we were too stupid to notice them anyway) but we cannot help but consider the sloppy direction that Michael Bey employs at times of fast action - which is shaking the camera all over the place in a manner that's meant to emulate the terror and confusion of the scene but instead merely irritates and detracts from the moment.As for the acting - *shudder*. It's no surprise Liv Tyler got nominated for a Golden Razzie and that Bruce Willis actually won one for this picture. The characters are so thinly drawn and so hammy that I actually laughed when they opened their lines at the drivel they spewed. Talented actors like Steve Buscemi and Billy Bob Thornton are wasted here - you can't lend that much talent when the character you're playing is riddled with more cliches than a millipede has legs. May I make a point about patriotism and family values? This movie features an American Presidential speech so cringe-inducing it makes Bill Pullman's from ID4 seem positively mellow. Let's not forget the schmaltzy family scenes we're forced to witness every now and then as families prepare for the end (good riddance to them) and the scenes of the world anxiously awaiting freedom from America (as if any other country could help out...). Then there's the love-scenes between Tyler and Affleck that make you hope they never get back together to avoid future wincings from the agonized viewer. And many other overly-sentimental poorly-executed moments that will make you understand subtlety is not a word these people are familiar with.Armageddon does everything brash and bold in an attempt to woo us that the shuddering mess underneath is actually a decent picture. Well - it isn't. If you can leave your brain at the door and turn off all critical faculties you may enjoy this other brainless hookum. If, like me, you're a discerning viewer than don't bother yourself the pain. The only thing I'll take from this movie is the eerie sight of the Twin Towers after the meteor strike and their resemblance to the actual attack's aftermath.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"31 January 2002","score":"","review":"  One thing that has always seem to bother about Hollywood is the way that they market some movies.  Okay for instance, the previews for movies like Event Horizon or The Way of the Gun are totally marketed the wrong way.  From the previews of Event Horizon, they led you to expect another Alien rip-off but instead ended up being a genius freak show of a horror film.  The previews for The Way of the Gun led you to expect a no-holds-barred action film (this fact was helped along with Limp Bizkit's Break Stuff playing in the background), but ended being one of the smartest crime thrillers of 2000.  Now we have Ghost Dog The Way of the Samurai.  It's about Ghost Dog(the never-better Forest Whitaker) who is a modern-day samurai and lives by himself on the roof of an old building.  He is also a hit man.  He kills quick and swiftly but does so by adhering to a special code of Samurai.  Ghost Dog is often employed by a dysfunctional crime family.  When a hit on a local mobster goes down the wrong way, a hit is ordered out on Ghost Dog.  When Ghost Dog gets word about this, he decides that he is going to fend off against the mobsters while still honoring the Code of the Samurai.  The previews for this movie are extremely misleading.  They lead you to expect another ghetto movie but this it is not.  It is actually a very intelligent and deeply moving crime drama.  There is some action, but thankfully those scenes are few and far between because this movie doesn't need action to deliver its message.  I must admit that is what I thought this movie was going to be but boy was I wrong.  A simple way to categorize this movie is just Samurai philosophy mixed in with an urban setting.  I really like Ghost Dog's philosophies and theories about the world.  He says that the world is changing.  He is right about that.  Things are getting bad but despite that, he is still able to live in peace with the world around him.  Special praise should go to director Jim Jarmusch. For he has created one of the most intellectual and challenging films ever made. Forest Whitaker is perfect in this movie.  I know that he hasn't been in too many well known movies but with the exceptions Oliver Stone's Platoon(he played Big Harold) and Bill Duke's A Rage in Harlem, you could say that he has been quite over-looked by critics and the movie-going public.  He has charisma in this film.  Ghost Dog's relationship with a Haitian ice cream truck driver are amongst some of the best scenes in the movie.  You see although the truck driver can't speak a word of English and Ghost Dog can't understand a word he says, their relationship still works on many levels.  Besides, they don't need words to play a game of chess. Some people who say that they didn't like this film, say that they understand it.  I admit that it is quite difficult to understand but you must learn to see things as Ghost Dog sees them.  He is not a violent person at all, but chooses to kill because it may very well be the only way he cam truly be at peace with the world.  I'm sure that not even he can really understand why the crime family that has come to trust him would all of a sudden want him dead.  But of course, that is what this movie is primarily about philosophy and the way people see things.I really like the scene where the Haitian ice cream truck driver reads the bear book.  The one passage he reads The bear is a solitary animal, adaptable to all sorts of climatic environments and foods.  In groups, they share food when quantities are abundant despite their limited social interaction.  The bear is formidable adversary with no predatory instincts at all.  But when surprised or wounded a bear may attack and becomes very dangerous.  In many ways this describes Ghost Dog.  He is solitary, can do whatever he wants despite being by himself all the time and is only dangerous when he feels threatened.  ***SPOILER***  The scene where he kills the two bear hunters and Ghost Dog explains what bears meant to ancient cultures I think is meant to exhibit his nature and his beliefs. Ghost Dog The Way of the Samurai certainly is not a film that is to be missed by anyone.  Everyone needs to see this film regardless of whether or not you are a fan of these kinds of movies.  10\/10       ","genre":null},{"date":"31 January 2002","score":"","review":"  One thing that has always seem to bother about Hollywood is the way that they market some movies.

I really like Ghost Dog's philosophies and theories about the world.  He says that the world is changing.  He is right about that.  Things are getting bad but despite that, he is still able to live in peace with the world around him.  Special praise should go to director Jim Jarmusch. For he has created one of the most intellectual and challenging films ever made. Forest Whitaker is perfect in this movie.  I know that he hasn't been in too many well known movies but with the exceptions Oliver Stone's Platoon(he played Big Harold) and Bill Duke's A Rage in Harlem, you could say that he has been quite over-looked by critics and the movie-going public.  He has charisma in this film.  Ghost Dog's relationship with a Haitian ice cream truck driver are amongst some of the best scenes in the movie.  You see although the truck driver can't speak a word of English and Ghost Dog can't understand a word he says, their relationship still works on many levels.  Besides, they don't need words to play a game of chess. Some people who say that they didn't like this film, say that they understand it.  I admit that it is quite difficult to understand but you must learn to see things as Ghost Dog sees them.  He is not a violent person at all, but chooses to kill because it may very well be the only way he cam truly be at peace with the world.  I'm sure that not even he can really understand why the crime family that has come to trust him would all of a sudden want him dead.  But of course, that is what this movie is primarily about philosophy and the way people see things.I really like the scene where the Haitian ice cream truck driver reads the bear book.  The one passage he reads The bear is a solitary animal, adaptable to all sorts of climatic environments and foods.  In groups, they share food when quantities are abundant despite their limited social interaction.  The bear is formidable adversary with no predatory instincts at all.  But when surprised or wounded a bear may attack and becomes very dangerous.  In many ways this describes Ghost Dog.  He is solitary, can do whatever he wants despite being by himself all the time and is only dangerous when he feels threatened.  ***SPOILER***  The scene where he kills the two bear hunters and Ghost Dog explains what bears meant to ancient cultures I think is meant to exhibit his nature and his beliefs. Ghost Dog The Way of the Samurai certainly is not a film that is to be missed by anyone.  Everyone needs to see this film regardless of whether or not you are a fan of these kinds of movies.  10\/10       ","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"31 January 2002","score":"","review":"  One thing that has always seem to bother about Hollywood is the way that they market some movies.  Okay for instance, the previews for movies like Event Horizon or The Way of the Gun are totally marketed the wrong way.  From the previews of Event Horizon, they led you to expect another Alien rip-off but instead ended up being a genius freak show of a horror film.  The previews for The Way of the Gun led you to expect a no-holds-barred action film (this fact was helped along with Limp Bizkit's Break Stuff playing in the background), but ended being one of the smartest crime thrillers of 2000.  Now we have Ghost Dog The Way of the Samurai.  It's about Ghost Dog(the never-better Forest Whitaker) who is a modern-day samurai and lives by himself on the roof of an old building.  He is also a hit man.  He kills quick and swiftly but does so by adhering to a special code of Samurai.  Ghost Dog is often employed by a dysfunctional crime family.  When a hit on a local mobster goes down the wrong way, a hit is ordered out on Ghost Dog.  When Ghost Dog gets word about this, he decides that he is going to fend off against the mobsters while still honoring the Code of the Samurai.  The previews for this movie are extremely misleading.  They lead you to expect another ghetto movie but this it is not.  It is actually a very intelligent and deeply moving crime drama.  There is some action, but thankfully those scenes are few and far between because this movie doesn't need action to deliver its message.  I must admit that is what I thought this movie was going to be but boy was I wrong.  A simple way to categorize this movie is just Samurai philosophy mixed in with an urban setting.

And that's pretty much true. But it's not entirely a problem, because the acting here is all quite good, and for the most part at the subtle end of the spectrum. Actors' movie suggests that the actors will get to scream and shout and cry - but here, rather, it's the many layers and shades of tension at a party that are the focus... ...well, until the second half of the movie, when they all scream and shout and cry. Which was a disappointment. I enjoyed the first half quite a lot - it achieved a sense of this social world really exists, and we all know about it and we're presenting it as faithfully as we can, which is, to me, always an interesting thing to watch onscreen, regardless of what that world is. The second half was more about DRAMA and REVELATIONS, which has its place, sure, but which inevitably pales in comparison to seeing a really convincing game of charades.People who take this movie and its creators to task for rampant self-indulgence are probably on to something - but that didn't really bother me, since I enjoyed it from a purely people-watching standpoint, and didn't feel it necessary to wonder what the filmmakers thought they were SAYING about these people.

And that is I believe an invitation for the viewer to examine what exactly is so damn irrefutably real about OUR own reality? The cryogenics 'lucid dream' explanation when it comes provides a much more satisfying twist than simply explaining Dave's delusions with psychosis.It is a little far-fetched perhaps, the idea that this type of technology would be accessible, but a little application of imagination and it shouldn't bother even the most ardent of cynics. They are the very people complaining that the viewer is spoonfed by the final ten minutes synopsis of what occured. So can't they use that brain of theirs they so love to use and decide for themselves how this could have been possible?I had heard absolutely no feedback or read any reviews before I went to see this film, and as such, didn't expect much based on the current standard of American movies. It blew me away. The best film I've seen in ages. I've also gathered that by the sheer volume of comments on this message board it provoked a lot of thought in others, displayed either willingly or in the mask of cynicism which (along with attempting to assert yourself to others and compensate for your deficits in other areas) was an indication of the thought-provoking majesty of this great film.

The film is truly disgusting to watch, (Spoilers, but I would qualify the following as the offensive material for some viewers) teenagers dressing like prostitutes and having sex with multiple partners, while being high or drinking are always on screen.

This movie will touch you even more if you have a past that makes a certain parallel with the character's lives.  The film criticizes today's youth, showing 8 year old boys drinking beer, teenagers killing someone, boys raping girls, among so much more stuff you wouldn't want your children to be involved in...but still, sincere congratulations to Mr.Clark, who wasn't afraid to show what was needed to give his message.  The realistic aspect of the film makes it so disturbing, and pretty hard as well as easy to watch.  The sexuality is disturbing, so realistic, the drug abuse too, and, of course, the murder too.  It really demonstrates how it should feel like for first-time (and young) murderers.  The directing had something very special, especially at one particular part of the movie, when five or six teens are talking about murdering a friend, and they're all high, and the camera turns around them while they're speaking, and it's important for the story to listen to the dialogue of that scene, but the camera makes you feel high by turning repeatedly around the actors.  The main problem of the film (the biggest, which is, in this film, not so important) is the SOOO short time spent on the idea of killing the bully...their idea seems so stupid, and some of the murderers don't even know him yet in the story, and already hate him, it seems almost like Clark had forgot to introduce the story, because of the long amount of time spent on showing how messed up the characters are, and he just had to rush for the story introduction.  But Bully delivers more than we expect.  It's realistic, but here's an important nuance to make; it's not all the teenagers that are like this, so, parents, don't worry, this is some of the worse cases you could imagine...but the murder idea in the film has nothing very realistic, seriously, for the beer and drugs, okay, for the sexuality, well that's a little forward (at least usually), but for the idea of killing someone...nah, even though the murder sequence is rendered wonderfully, its basis is exaggerated.  I don't know how this movie could be released with only an R rating (it really deserves an NC-17!).  Oh yeah, by the way, the ending is a good conclusion and interesting.  Overall, this movie is a great one, really, it's raw, powerful, but exaggerated a bit...Excellent actors, except for Mrs.Bijou Phillips...Heavy advisory, this contains graphic, realistic sexuality, violence and gore, substance abuse, and pervasive strong language.

Of course, Salieri was jealous of Mozart's talent, but if that were all there was, it would be a poor film indeed.

God, who had given Salieri an inexpressible longing to music, but had not given him the talent to pull it off.

I'll never forget the bedroom transcription scene, when Salieri is helping Mozart with his Requiem.  Brilliant.  We hear each part, one at a time, and think Oh, yes, that's quite good.  But then, hearing it all together, it's a shock... a visceral, stomach clenching shock.  And while hearing this incredibly powerful, yet complex (hmmm) music finally coming together, we see Frau Mozart's carriage returning her to Vienna.  We have no specific reason to dread her return, but the music, so full of dread, prepares us masterfully for the final confrontation. Ahh, a spectacular film which rewards every viewing.

That aside, this is still a pretty good film, a comedy that also takes on some serious issues concerning organized religion, while avoiding, for the most part, being excessively preachy about it. The best parts, as in all Smith films, are the dialog scenes. In this instance, we get conversations between a woman who goes through the motions of attending church but has pretty much lost faith, a pair of fallen angels looking for revenge, another angel who needs to enlist the woman (Bethany) to stop the aforementioned evil duo, Rufus, the 13th Apostle, Serendipidy the Muse (played by the sizzling Salma Hayek) and of course, Jay & Silent Bob, a pair of clueless stoner prophets. Each of the characters is well constructed and acted, and their various interactions shed an unconventional light on many aspects of the Catholic Church in particular, and religion in general. Hardcore fundamentalists would probably find this movie insulting, even blasphemous, but the rest of us will see it for what it is, a humorous look at some of the foibles of organized religion. Kevin Smith clearly can distinguish between poking fun at certain Dogmas while at the same time showing respect for the larger underlying concepts of faith and goodness.What doesn't work, however, are the action scenes, most notably the ending, which gets pretty bloody and gory. Not to mention his choice of God, who is uncredited and thus, I suppose, considered a spoiler, so I'll merely say that the classic Rodney Dangerfield line `Last time I saw a mouth like that, it had a hook in it' aptly describes the actor chosen for this honor. Also, he relies too much on gross out humor, which is a shame, since comic dialog is really his forte. For example, angels apparently have no sex organs. Fine, he can tell us that, he doesn't need to have Alan Rickman pull down his pants and show us. And show us and show us, in a scene that seems to go on forever. And then there's the great poop monster-demon. Perhaps Kevin Smith saw how successful movies like Dumb & Dumber and There's Something About Mary were, and decided to get on the gross bandwagon, but at least for me, it just doesn't work. And, in a film about religion, he probably could have cut back on the gratuitous swearing a bit without losing any of the humor.

And what a tremendous experience.  Everything about this movie just struck me so correctly (except perhaps the affair with the middle-aged guy).  I see Enid and Rebecca as myself and my best friend with vaginas.  Sure, we make ironic pokes at everything, but when does it reach the limit?  When does irony come full circle?  Is a life spent taking in the kitsch make you no better than the supposed drones around you?Some of the best elements of the film, something Daniel Clowes so richly preserved from his own tremendous graphic novel, were the background elements, the banal passerby, the characters we're all familiar with. Fat women lugging their half-dozen kids around.  Rattails.  The pandered-to disabled.  Tubby guys in baseball caps and red jackets sucking down fast-food.  From the opening sponsors of the graduation, to the closing shots of gloomy neon signs, commercialism is both omnipresent and pretty much ignored.  Crap is everywhere, nobody would deny that, but can one escape it just through mockery?I can't commend Zwigoff and Clowes enough for this adaptation.  Though itdoes drift from the source material, and perhaps ignores Rebecca a bit much at the end, elements like Enid and Seymour's romance lend a poignant awkwardness.  No easy solutions are ever reached.  Things just change, not for the better, not any worse, they just do.  I see my own life's attitudes, the struggle to find an identity in a sea of both individuals and hives. I can't be complacent, but the ironic distance can become just as tiresome. I guess I just identify with Enid so much it's either amazing or pathetic. Anyways, I recommend this to anyone who's ever tried to look at the world through skewed eyes.  It's not just for the spazzes, mods, or neo-geeks. It's for all the Enids in the world, male or female, bob-haired or long, thick-lenses or contacts.Oh, and you haven't seen anything til you've seen the mullet nunchaku redneck.  Anything.
