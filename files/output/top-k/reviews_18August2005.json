It's a real shame this film is not more well known as it is well acted, well directed with a superb script and set-up. Every character in the movie has their faults Witherspoons character is self absorbed, Klines is just stupid and Brodericks infidelity but at varying points in the movie we feel different emotions for each of them. As dis-likable as Weatherspoons character is it's difficult not to feel sorry for her at the end of High School Party but in the end scene we again see her as a manipulative self obsessed go-getter willing to stamp on anybody.The film has a very serious subject matter the role of shallow popularity in politics and elsewhere in life but it never lets this dominate. The drama and pitch black comedy are always kept to the fore and it will grip you from beginning to end as to just what will become of them all.This is a movie I would highly recommend to anyone 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 August 2005","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Election is a very sharp satire on politics and popularity set in an American high school.
