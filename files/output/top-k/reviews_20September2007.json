[{"date":"20 September 2007","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The Lady Vanishes was a crucial picture in Alfred Hitchcock's cannon. It represents the pinnacle of his British espionage adventures which he had been perfecting since 1932's Number Seventeen, and arguably the best of all his British pictures. It is also the beginning in a cycle of wartime propaganda films which Hitch would continue into his Hollywood career.One of several things that makes The Lady Vanishes stand out is its opening. It begins with a good twenty minutes or so of introductory scenes at the station hotel &#150; quite a significant amount for a 100 minute film &#150; which are mainly for comedy and characterisation, and are almost superfluous as far as the real plot goes. What's more, these scenes concentrate far more on the supporting characters &#150; particularly the brilliant creations Caldicott and Charters &#150; than the protagonists. For all the audience knows at this point, this might as well be a comedy about Brits on holiday. Normally, an introduction of this length would become boring and be disastrous for the pacing of a thriller, but it's anything but. The comedy in these scenes is brilliant, far funnier than in any other Hitchcock film I know. The characters and set pieces created here are just so purely entertaining, it's actually ironically one of the most engrossing parts of the film.Hitchcock by now had a formula for these adventure thrillers. Margaret Lockwood is not exactly the Wrong Man (or wrong woman) that would generally lead these pictures, but all the devices are the same. Chance has embroiled her in criminal goings on she has nothing to do with, she is desperately trying to prove a secret only she knows, but just like the Wrong Man trying to prove his innocence, all the evidence points against her.This is also one of the earlier examples of a Hitchcock thriller where the bulk of the action takes place in one location. True, the train is not as small as the apartments of Rope (1948) or Rear Window (1954), or the titular vessel of Lifeboat (1944), but Hitchcock clearly recognises that the best suspense comes from the simplest elements, and that there is a greater sense of danger in a confined space. The train setting itself is also a source of plenty of little devices &#150; the screeching whistles and thundering wheels which build the feeling of confusion and mystery, not to mention the most heart-racing moment when Michael Redgrave clambers along the outside of the train.Even though The Lady Vanishes was released a year before the war began there is a fairly clear subtext about an expectation of war in Europe. Hitchcock's espionage pictures were always paradoxically about political intrigue and completely apolitical at the same time. Although there might be talk of foreign spies and nations pitted against one another, there was never any genuine politics or explanation of what either side stood for. Still, the mysterious fictional Eastern European dictatorship in which the action takes place is obviously a nod towards Hitler's Germany &#150; much like the also fictional Borduria in the Tintin story King Ottakar's Sceptre, which appeared at around the same time.The propaganda angle becomes most apparent in the final act, where the dining carriage of all things becomes a metaphor for England &#150; isolated and forced to defend itself. Although he was usually more concerned with suspense, for these purposes Hitchcock proved he was adept at stirring the audiences emotions, and this is surely one of the most rousing get ready films of the era. The point is hammered home most firmly when one of the British passengers refuses to fight. As Caldicott (Naunton Wayne) tells him Pacifist eh? Won't work old boy. Early Christians tried it and got thrown to the lions! Despite being very much a film of its time, The Lady Vanishes still holds up today as a great suspense adventure, not to mention a great comedy. It has so many great elements, the dialogue, the direction, as well as great acting performances all round. It's also the end of an era. Hitchcock's films would rarely be quite so expressionist and flamboyant when he moved to Hollywood the following year.

Next day at school everybody was discussing that movie, our hips were saying Tarantino about a hundred times a minute. I was never hip, so when I asked which of them was Tarantino, they gave me a look that could kill. Tarantino is THE DIRECTOR, and by the way, he played there too. It was very funny &#150; they considered knowing that so valuable, to me it was no more than just a movie then. Who did he play? I asked. When they told me I was shocked What?! That pathetic imbecile in the robe was actually the director?!!! How could I know that that imbecile's IQ is 160 to my 118, but I didn't know it then and I didn't care.Funny, that exact dialogue that made me revere Tarantino years later, that dialogue is cut off the most of the copies of the movie, and the Cannes saw the cut version too. At least, the script is available for free and anyone can enjoy the full version, which contains even the unfilmed scenes.The main dialogue of the movie is cut. It is where Mia is giving Vince a third degree. It is here where Tarantino speaks himself and for himself (even though everyone in his movies is Tarantino, even bacteria in the actors' sweat speak Tarantino F English, still here it is his dream and his dream-girl), it's his fantasy, it's the questions he wanted to answer &#150; he actually dreamed of getting beaten up by a girl, he loves Amazons, and his other works prove it (Jackie Brown, Kill Bill vol.1, Death Proof, etc.) Only strong men like to see strong women by their side.Tarantino and Roger Avary share the Best Original Screenplay Oscar, but actually the full script was written by Cutie only, the stories were developed together. It was Roger Avary who developed the hideous rape scene, he said about that like all writers do &#150; the characters did that on their own to the author's surprise, because he is a nice person, who would never invent something like that.Anyway, it's a movie that arouses a wide variety of interpretation, from seeing the deepest philosophical ditch in it to the calling it the lowest pop chuck, to me it is a classic Tarantino, and that says it all. He loved to see his beautiful child with the people, he would go to the cinema and watch it every time like the first time with them, noticing when they tensed and when they laughed, being tensed and laughing with them, being the happiest guy in the whole wide world then. I really think that he was the happiest guy then, you wouldn't find another like him.Well, there is one thing I hate when some very sophisticated and very spiritual specimen start to zoom around about some irony of the movie, the irony of Cutie, who is against violence on the screen, and in his movie he is saying People, look at what you are doing, and stop!, and they say it in such a pompous voice that it makes me almost physically sick. One of them happened to blabber in that way in my company. She had some good ideas too &#150; she pointed out &#150; it is not the bodies that shock, it is the attitude towards them that does. That is a nice phrase that sums up the reason why his movies seem to be and they are extra-violent. Okay, but then she goes again &#150; people, look blah-blah-blah. I couldn't stand any longer I told her about the first script, where Vince shot Marvin in the throat, and then with Tarantino little talk shot him in the head, Cuite changed that scene into one shot in the head &#150; she was happy and said Because it is softer!, No, - I gloated, - HE actually said himself that he changed that because the straight shot in the head was FUNNIER. She almost freaked out.Look, you may see anything you want in it, even Nostradamus prophecy, but keep in mind, that Tarantino is a brilliant guy who loves action, crime and kung-fu movies just for the fun of it, and we love him for that. You may see anything you want in Marcellus's case (from Marcellus's soul to Da Vinci manuscripts), but keep in mind that Tarantino and Avary concealed its contents only because their initial idea seemed too trivial to them &#150; diamonds. They say It depends on viewer's mind, well, of course, it does, but I want to know what it is on your mind, that's why I watch your movie.So, one may see Da Vinci manuscripts, yet it may be plainly diamonds, but the movie is really epic. (I can't say that it's a must see, I don't like the word a must see, like something forcing you into something) It is more than a fantastically good movie, it is the New Testament of cinema &#150; new way of speaking in the movies, new way of storytelling, new way of being in the movies, new way of seeing the very movie-making idea.

Ironically enough, both characters are played by Liv Tyler and were films at least released in the same year although The Lord of the Rings was filmed much earlier &#150; in a nutshell, One Night at McCool's is the idea that these faceless males do what the character tells them to do only to be on the receiving end of something they didn't want and didn't expect.One Night at McCool's is a film that tires to be smarter than it actually is. Its essence of noir and the way it thinks it cleverly tells the story of three males whose stories interlock and are told through a flashback technique is really just a smokescreen for what's really underneath. The film centres around the extremely aptly named Jewel Valentine since Jewel's her first name and everybody's after her and Valentine was the martyred saint that became associated with love so she's really called 'everyone's after her love'. The film's title could also do with a facelift as it too could be called 'Let's just do everything Jewell tells us to.' One Night at McCool's is not brilliant film-making but more-so, it's a terrible case of women being identified as objects who seduce stupid men through a series of actions easy sex, revealing costumes, feigning romantic interest and just being whatever sexual fantasy they want them to be &#150; these are the actions of a prostitute or a call girl more than anything else and the way in which the dumb males fall into the trap does not make for good, entertaining or even fun viewing.I will not criticise the film for trying something new to get its basic ideas across. The three men who fall foul of her are Randy (Dillon), Detective Dehling (Goodman) and Carl Harding (Reiser); all three of which are very different sorts of men a young and outgoing kid, an experienced police man and a lawyer who's the kind of guy who'd probably tell his wife he's going to mainland Europe for a couple of business conferences over the course of a few days when really he's spending the weekend in Amsterdam making use of the 'facilities'. Each character is well acted by an array of talent and each character is of different background and has seemingly different attitudes and outlooks on life, giving us a choice of one to map onto. Apart from anything else, the characters are put across in such a way that makes us care what happens to them in a way; Randy especially since it is Jewel's actions that cause him to hit rock bottom and I, at least, felt very bad for him when the occurrence happens.The film deserves its criticisms when it comes to little things like having the priest not really interested in the tragic story the detective is giving until the part including the sex pops up; that as well as its tendency to drag at certain times since its revolving around the same thing over and over that being the seduction of one of the three male characters by Jewel &#150; at one point, the film centres around Jewel and Randy living together and just consists of her filling the house up with new furniture which goes on for about fifteen minutes. If the film does have a high point, it's the closing shootout in which a random character shows up armed to the teeth demanding to know who killed his brother from earlier on in the film &#150; I am not ashamed to admit the scene had me laughing rather hard but just because of the absurdity of the soundtrack and action.That may have been One Night at McCool's high point, but it didn't build and build to get there; it just rather shot up to its peak there and then and that made me think &#150; it only happened because of an event from the first twenty minutes that the guy was even there. One Night at McCool's is uneven and bizarre but good fun for one viewing &#150; it's not like you'd want spend two nights at McCool's after this, is it?

Ironically enough, both characters are played by Liv Tyler and were films at least released in the same year although The Lord of the Rings was filmed much earlier &#150; in a nutshell, One Night at McCool's is the idea that these faceless males do what the character tells them to do only to be on the receiving end of something they didn't want and didn't expect.One Night at McCool's is a film that tires to be smarter than it actually is. Its essence of noir and the way it thinks it cleverly tells the story of three males whose stories interlock and are told through a flashback technique is really just a smokescreen for what's really underneath. The film centres around the extremely aptly named Jewel Valentine since Jewel's her first name and everybody's after her and Valentine was the martyred saint that became associated with love so she's really called 'everyone's after her love'.

His 1994 adaptation of Mary Shelley's famous novel met with pure venom on its original release, and is now widely regarded as nothing more than a failure, and yet it is brilliant. Having read and loved Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus just a few weeks ago, I came to realise how James Whale's 1931 film &#150; despite being a cinematic masterpiece &#150; had completely butchered Shelley's original story, and had permanently distorted how the general public viewed the Frankenstein tale. Thus, Kenneth Branagh took it upon himself to craft a worthy adaptation to a remarkable novel, creating a visually-stunning, highly-theatrical, gripping, wildly over-the-top tragedy that is largely faithful to its source material. Basically, it's the version I'd been yearning to see.Branagh portrays the ill-fated Victor Frankenstein, whose heartfelt bid for eternal glory ends in his losing everybody he cares about. Despite what others have voiced, I thought that he was excellent in the role. Robert De Niro lends his mighty talents to the Creature (and the filmmakers make a point of declaring that, in fact, the monster doesn't have a name), an immense, horrific, repulsive abomination of nature, whose hopeless existence nonetheless commands a certain sense of pity. Helena Bonham Carter is very good as Elizabeth, Victor's devoted life-long love (and adopted sister). Competent supporting performances also come from Ian Holm as Baron Frankenstein, Tom Hulce as good friend Henry Clerval and John Cleese completely unrecognisable as Professor Waldman (or, at least, I never noticed that it was him).Kenneth Branagh comes from a background in theatre, and so it's no surprise to see that he plays the story as a sort of theatrical Gothic melodrama, and he overplays Victor just the right amount. For those striving for realism, this might just seem silly and contrived, but, if you consider the fantastic nature of the plot, it is probably the most reliable direction to steer. At times, however, the director seems unsure as to exactly what genre he wishes his film to be, and it occasionally seesaws between straight horror, swashbuckling adventure and high camp. The sequence in which Victor succeeds in resurrecting Elizabeth from the dead (the one major deviance from the original novel) seems like something that might have sprung from the mind of Tim Burton, and, aside from demonstrating the phenomenal make-up work, it is much too cheesy to fit in with the tone of the rest of the film.I'm in two minds about Robert De Niro's performance as the Creature. When I was reading the book, I imagined that his creation would be a terrifying appearance, with the resultant monster a nasty, repulsive indignation towards Mankind. Instead, the Creature was simply pathetic; I can't imagine anything more morbidly wretched than Victor frantically wrestling his creation's lifeless form within a pool of amniotic fluid. Nevertheless, even given a limited vocabulary, De Niro commands attention from the audience, with his character's waverings between sensitivity and malevolence leaving us with conflicting emotions towards him. All in all, Kenneth Branagh's 'Frankenstein' is an excellent adaptation of literature's first great work of science-fiction, which is as respectful to the source material as it is visual stunning. Roger Pratt's cinematography is simply exquisite, particularly his sweeping aerial photography of the Swiss Alps. Visual effects are integrated well, complementing the story but never overshadowing it. For fans of Mary Shelley's novel, I can't help but recommend it.

Rope offers one such instance, with a decided Hitchcockian twist This time, while the characters are free to come and go, you are the one trapped.The sealed place is a swank Manhattan penthouse where prep-school pals Brandon Shaw (John Dall) and Phillip Morgan (Farley Granger) do away with their old friend David for the sake of a thrill kill. Then, to put what Brandon calls the inspired finishing touch to their exhilarating crime, the two throw a party for several carefully chosen guests, including the victims' parents and girlfriend, while David lays inside a chest where dinner is served.The Davids of this world merely occupy space, which is why he was the perfect victim for the perfect murder, Brandon says as he helps himself to a post-homicidal cigarette.They don't even lock the chest because, as Brandon observes, it's much more dangerous that way. Needless to say, the pair play things a little too cute for their own good, especially when they invite their former prep-school teacher Rupert Cadell (James Stewart), who is suspicious.Alfred Hitchcock made a lot of movies about murders, but few rub the viewers' noses in the fact of the crime quite like this one. Shot in ten long single-shot intervals with oft-disguised cuts, Rope is a masterpiece of tension-building, the camera keeping you in the center of action as both witness and accomplice, its cranes, pans, and zooms tweaking and clawing at you as you both wish for and dread the moment of discovery.The acting is stiff, sure, in part because of the unique demands of filming and in part because Dall and Granger were not good screen actors. Yet they work as jaded preppies precisely because they behave so awkwardly, kids with half a clue who think they know it all. It could be a case of subversive casting, like Peter Bogdanovich observed was the case with Robert Cummings in Dial M For Murder. The rest of the cast suggests characters in a J.D. Salinger story, except less literate and more chi-chi. But they help to build an exquisite mood.Stewart is wrong for the part of Cadell. He's supposed to be a cynical nihilist, yet he makes his points unconvincingly and you have no doubt his inherent decency will come to the fore in the end. As many here note, James Mason would have made for a more ambiguous figure that way. Yet Stewart acquits himself admirably, moving from scene to scene with a fluidity that matches the camera, the one non-wooden presence in the film. A total pro, as if it needs saying.Like most Hitchcock movies, Rope is not a deep film. There's unspoken subtext about the homosexuality of Phillip and Brandon (in all of Hitchcock's films, only Bruno Anthony in Strangers On A Train is more obviously gay), and some philosophical prattle about Nietzsche. It's subtle, but not particularly profound, just interesting from multiple angles.One notable problem Theo Robertson points out in his November 2005 review is why Brandon involves the unsteady Phillip in his crime. The way I read it is it's clear there's a sadomasochistic strain at the heart of their relationship, in Brandon's willingness to slyly torture his friend with the possibility of discovery that hints at both their transgressive sexuality and a sickness at the heart of Brandon the perfect murderer. He not only foregoes a lock for the chest, but ties the rope used to strangle David around a stack of books he gives David's father, leering at Phillip all the while. Of course, he is also leering at the audience, furthering our involvement in the foul deed.Many of us find ourselves trapped in parties, wishing we could leave.

They do practice to the track before filming and typically can match the song perfectly, even if they didn't sing the original. But I've noticed as I watch the film today, that the whole sync is out. This would be an artifact of digital technology, in which the picture and sound are processed separately, and when broadcast, don't always arrive to your TV set exactly at the same time, as it appears to be the case as I watch it on TCM. Also, if the sync is out in the original film, that is more the fault of the film editor, than the actor. By the way, this whole film was looped, which means all the dialog was re-recorded afterward in a sound studio, with sound effects added afterward. But this was pretty standard for the day, as well.Personally, I think the strong but restrained performances and wonderful songs make this a film to be watched at least once if you are a fan, lover, or student of classic cine.

The Mummy Returns picks up seven years after the first film. Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evie (Rachel Weisz) are married and have a precocious (and stereotypical) son named Alex (Freddie Boath).Unfortunately, their peace is about to be shattered. Anck Su Namun (the incredibly gorgeous Patricia Velasquez) has been reincarnated. She has teamed up with a museum curator (Alun Armstrong) and his cult, led by Lock-Nah (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, who should get an award just for hanging onto such an difficult name in Hollywood circles). Together, they excavate the ruins of Hamunaptra and unearth Imhotep. Later, they will revive him in London, try to revive the Bracelet of Anubis, kidnap Evie, sic mummies on Rick, Jonathan and Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr), kidnap Alex and lead our heroes on a dangerous search for the Oasis of Ahm Shere, where Imhotep hopes to defeat the fabled Scorpion King (played mostly in CG by The Rock) and take control of the Army of Anubis.Whew, that's a mouthful. The film has great action. A big fight scene in Rick's house, both upstairs and downstairs. A shoot-out in a museum. An exciting bus chase through the streets of London. A race between a tidal wave and a dirigible. An attack by strange-looking (and, ultimately, annoying) pygmy skeletons. A showdown between Imhotep and Rick, Jonathan and Anck Su Namun and then Evie and Anck Su Namun.Definitely worth the price of admission.However, the film had too many errors to warrant more than a five. Let's face it. Most movies had continuity errors (even Raiders of the Lost Ark) but this film goes way beyond normal. It's almost like no research was done for this film and the director just went for what he thought the world of 1933 would look like.For example 1) There's a woman-on-woman fight scene in ancient Egypt before Pharoah Seti I, featuring sai blades. Sai blades were not in Egypt, but were created in China during the Ming Dynasty, which did not come about until 1368.2) Alex's slingshot wasn't made until 1954.3) Jonathan breaks off a key in the ignition of Rick's limousine, yet ignition keys for cars didn't come around until 1949.4) The double-decker bus Jonathan commandeers in London was not designed until 1954.5) Izzy (Shaun Parks), pilot of the dirigible that takes Rick and Evie to Ahm Shere, uses a fire extinguisher that seems old but wasn't made until 1980.6) Alex is supposed to be eight years old. The Three Stooges -- actually three schmucks (Bruce Byron, Joe Dixon, Tom Fisher) written in only to be cannon fodder for Imhotep's assimilation -- comment that the Black Book of the Dead meant death for the Yanks of the original film nine years earlier. Much of the original film was set in 1926, a mere 7(!!!) years earlier. Somehow, the script writers fixated on 1923, the year in which the original movie was begun (remember, after Rick's escape from Hamunaptra, the film advanced three years to 1926).7) There are a few other major hits, but none worse than (possible spoiler) a massive fight between the 12 Tribes of the Medjai and Anubis' warrior army. The 12 tribes seem to have 10,000 men on horseback. After the first round of battle, they're whittled down to several hundred, but we see not one body -- of Medjai or horse nor will we. If the film was trying to capture the magnificence of Lord of the Rings Return of the King or even Spartacus, it failed horribly.But, perhaps the most egregious problem is how the sequel screws up the events of the original film. In The Mummy Returns, Evie is presented as the physical and spiritual reincarnation of Nefertiri, daughter of Seti I. In the first film, however, Imhotep mistakes Evie for a reincarnation of Anck Su Namun. How could he have not recognized Nefertiri? In TMR, he doesn't seem to recognize her as Nefertiri either. In fact, Anck Su Namun doesn't recognize Evie as Nefertiri until almost the end of the film. What gives?Also, at the end of the first film, when Imhotep sinks into the Well of Souls, he loses all the life he ripped from the Americans and the Egyptologist. We see his eyes and tongue go last. In TMR, he reawakens with eyes and a tongue.Oh, well, maybe I'm being too harsh. Brendan Fraser was his usual cool self and Arnold Vosloo almost stole the show again. The Rock was not in the film enough (but was in The Scorpion King way too much). The fight scene between Rick and Imhotep was fantastic with its array of weapons. It was also nice to see Jonathan stop being a cowardly wuss and Alex did tone down the annoying mischievous kid act by the end of the film. Anck Su Namun was particular seductive and evil (see her first meeting with Alex), although I had a hard time believing how her (oops, spoiler potential)...demise was presented. It seemed suddenly out of character and forced. So, just go with the flow on this on. Watch it for the action and try not to be too cerebral. For action flicks, thinking too much can hurt.

The Three Stooges -- actually three schmucks (Bruce Byron, Joe Dixon, Tom Fisher) written in only to be cannon fodder for Imhotep's assimilation -- comment that the Black Book of the Dead meant death for the Yanks of the original film nine years earlier. Much of the original film was set in 1926, a mere 7(!!!) years earlier. Somehow, the script writers fixated on 1923, the year in which the original movie was begun (remember, after Rick's escape from Hamunaptra, the film advanced three years to 1926).7) There are a few other major hits, but none worse than (possible spoiler) a massive fight between the 12 Tribes of the Medjai and Anubis' warrior army. The 12 tribes seem to have 10,000 men on horseback. After the first round of battle, they're whittled down to several hundred, but we see not one body -- of Medjai or horse nor will we. If the film was trying to capture the magnificence of Lord of the Rings Return of the King or even Spartacus, it failed horribly.But, perhaps the most egregious problem is how the sequel screws up the events of the original film. In The Mummy Returns, Evie is presented as the physical and spiritual reincarnation of Nefertiri, daughter of Seti I. In the first film, however, Imhotep mistakes Evie for a reincarnation of Anck Su Namun. How could he have not recognized Nefertiri? In TMR, he doesn't seem to recognize her as Nefertiri either. In fact, Anck Su Namun doesn't recognize Evie as Nefertiri until almost the end of the film. What gives?Also, at the end of the first film, when Imhotep sinks into the Well of Souls, he loses all the life he ripped from the Americans and the Egyptologist. We see his eyes and tongue go last. In TMR, he reawakens with eyes and a tongue.Oh, well, maybe I'm being too harsh. Brendan Fraser was his usual cool self and Arnold Vosloo almost stole the show again. The Rock was not in the film enough (but was in The Scorpion King way too much). The fight scene between Rick and Imhotep was fantastic with its array of weapons. It was also nice to see Jonathan stop being a cowardly wuss and Alex did tone down the annoying mischievous kid act by the end of the film. Anck Su Namun was particular seductive and evil (see her first meeting with Alex), although I had a hard time believing how her (oops, spoiler potential)...demise was presented. It seemed suddenly out of character and forced. So, just go with the flow on this on. Watch it for the action and try not to be too cerebral. For action flicks, thinking too much can hurt.

The Mummy Returns picks up seven years after the first film. Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evie (Rachel Weisz) are married and have a precocious (and stereotypical) son named Alex (Freddie Boath).Unfortunately, their peace is about to be shattered. Anck Su Namun (the incredibly gorgeous Patricia Velasquez) has been reincarnated. She has teamed up with a museum curator (Alun Armstrong) and his cult, led by Lock-Nah (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, who should get an award just for hanging onto such an difficult name in Hollywood circles). Together, they excavate the ruins of Hamunaptra and unearth Imhotep. Later, they will revive him in London, try to revive the Bracelet of Anubis, kidnap Evie, sic mummies on Rick, Jonathan and Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr), kidnap Alex and lead our heroes on a dangerous search for the Oasis of Ahm Shere, where Imhotep hopes to defeat the fabled Scorpion King (played mostly in CG by The Rock) and take control of the Army of Anubis.Whew, that's a mouthful. The film has great action. A big fight scene in Rick's house, both upstairs and downstairs. A shoot-out in a museum. An exciting bus chase through the streets of London. A race between a tidal wave and a dirigible. An attack by strange-looking (and, ultimately, annoying) pygmy skeletons. A showdown between Imhotep and Rick, Jonathan and Anck Su Namun and then Evie and Anck Su Namun.Definitely worth the price of admission.However, the film had too many errors to warrant more than a five. Let's face it. Most movies had continuity errors (even Raiders of the Lost Ark) but this film goes way beyond normal.

What if it's somebody completely unexpected? What if it's us?Stanley Kubrik's incomparable, eye glazing, and sometimes too funny for its subject matter movie entitled Full Metal Jacket (1987) expands on the theme of the enemy in war. Co-written by Michael Herr, author of Dispatches (a memoir of a combat correspondent), the film watches like a war novel. Composed of choppy scenes that pick up like rounds of fire and usually end with a message hidden beneath a seemingly meaningless line such as, You know there's not a single horse in the entire country of Vietnam? There's definitely something wrong with that, the movie connects with even the biggest fanatics of classic war literature, putting you in the action through its cinematography just as a writer would with his voice or style. Like the protagonist, Private Joker (Matthew Modine), who wears a peace button on his flak jacket and a helmet inscribed with the phrase, Born to kill, claiming that it suggest something about the duality of man, the movie is also divided into two parts. The first half takes place in an American boot camp where Private Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio), an overweight and clearly misplaced product of the draft, takes verbal and physical beatings from Gny. Sgt. Hartman (Lee Ermey) and his bunkmates. Although Joker tries to help Pyle, the constant harassment is too much too bear. The movie then shifts to Vietnam where Joker, now a combat correspondent (like Herr) reports on the war with a rifle in one hand and a pen in the other. Sitting on the remains of a concrete building with a squad of marines, Joker is confronted by an action figural GI. This is his party, he says, removing a cover from the face of the person sitting next to him only to reveal a dead seventeen year- old North Vietnamese corporal. He is the guest of honor, he continues. Today is his birthday. It hurts to laugh. The movie examines the way we dehumanize the enemy in war. We call them Dinks or Charlie so that we can convince ourselves that we are fighting anything but a human being. But as depicted in the end of the movie (don't worry, I won't spoil it), the enemy could truly be anybody. And that includes us. We are trained to deface the enemy so that we can kill them without remorse. We strip them of all their humanity while trying to maintain our own. Like Joker we are divided human beings. We are divided between wanting to help Pvt. Pyle load his gun so that he avoids more ridicule and wanting to beat the living s*** out of him with a towel. Full Metal Jacket examines the issue of creating our enemies, doing so in a way that is unprecedented by any other war movie. By putting us, the viewer, through boot camp and then dropping us into combat, we experience dehumanization. But that can only last so long. And indeed, in the movie, it lasts only until the end. What Full Metal Jacket lacks in plot, it makes up for in its script. Its realistic representation of war as long periods of boredom interspersed with moments of horrific excitement is enough to make you fearful of another draft.

John Cusack plays an unsuccessful puppeteer in New York, married to a thoroughly deglamorized Cameron Diaz. He has the hots for his sole employee, his tough and savvy office-mate, Catherine Keener.Then he discovers a kind of crawlspace in his office, at the end of which is the sensorium of the actor John Malkovich. That is, Cusack can be in the mind of the real John Malkovich, but only for 15 minutes at a time, after which he is spit out and flops on the ground next to the New Jersey Turnpike. Cusack decides that if he can't get anyone to pay to see his puppets he can at least charge the public $200 apiece for their 15 minutes in Malkovich's mind. (This doesn't bother Malkovich because he seems completely unaware of anyone else's being inside him.) But Cusack's secretary, Keener, has the hots for Malkovich and through this portal is able to get his private phone number and agree to meet her at a restaurant. They meet, as arranged. However, when they sit across the table from one another and Keener gazes at Malkovich, glowing with admiration and a filthier kind of lust, Malkovich's mind happens to be occupied by Cameron Diaz at that moment. Diaz has previously spent time taking a shower with Malkovich and has found the idea of having a male's plumbing appealing. Now, she melts under the adoring gaze of Keener in the restaurant.Diaz returns from Malkovich and tells her husband, John Cusack the failed puppeteer, that she must be a trans-sexual because she has never had a woman stare at her with such love as Keener showed towards Malkovich in the restaurant. Now she wants an operation and she's going to talk to Dr. Lester. The astounded Cusack shouts, But Dr. Lester is an ALLERGIST! The next evening, Cusack and his wife are having dinner at home with Keener. They explain the situation to her, then they both throw themselves on Keener at the same time. Keener slaps Cusack away and tells Diaz that, yes, she finds Diaz attractive -- but only when Diaz is in Malkovich.Then it gets REALLY complicated. There is a pursuit at one point through the repressed memories of Malkovich's subconscious, with Malkovich seen peeing his pants on the school bus and sniffing panties. (Malkovich -- the real Malkovich -- must have a heck of a sense of humor. His character admits to being stoned, and we see him exercising his libido, being snooty towards cab drivers, and so forth.) The story ends up with Diaz fathering her own child by Keener while occupying Malkovich.If this were a novel, it would be something like Kafka's Metamorphosis or Nicholson Baker's The Fermata, both attempt to follow the logic of an absurd premise. It also packs a lot of humor and pathos into the story, along the lines of Pirandello and Ionescu. Example of what I mean When John Cusack returns from his first trip into Malkovich's brain, he no longer has the piece of wood he took with him. In the face of Keener's skepticism, Cusack demands to know where that piece of wood IS. Did it disappear in the ether? Is it still somehow back there in Malkovich's brain? Good question. Keener, by the way, is very sexy. She has a throaty laugh, nice limbs, and she is strictly utilitarian, only interested in money and sex until she falls for Diaz. She never heard of either John Malkovitch or metaphysics.As a film it most closely resembles something that Woody Allen might have come up with if Allen had been in the habit of ingesting psychedelic substances, or something Monty Python might have dreamed up without any chemical help. (I must say I didn't get much out of Brazil.) If you want a sense of the lengths to which this film is willing to go, imagine a scene from Swan Lake being performed in front of a full audience, involving the entire corps de ballet, with a human-sized wooden puppet in the middle of a circle of ballerinas, and the puppet is unclothed, made of raw wood, with all his hinges and joints showing, and the audience stands up and applauds.

You go to a clinical psychologist, see, and you sit down and take the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), and then you ask the shrink what your profile looks like.

I much prefer a good psychological Western between complex antagonists, Eastwood's own Unforgiven would be an example. This was more a straightforward tale of three desperadoes consumed by greed who attempt to outwit each other on the trail to an unknown grave containing two hundred thousand dollars in gold coin. Each though, earns their respective title credit in the story, even if Eastwood's Blondie might be the 'good' simply based on his classically rugged features.More on the plus side, it was really cool to hear the title theme music expressed in a handful of different ways throughout the story.

He made his first impression as a pudgy teenager who gets killed by Gregory Peck in the excellent Boys From Brazil(1978). The classic Diner(MGM,1982) established him as a fine actor and in Police Academy(1984) he was suddenly a buff leading man in a critically maligned yet audience loved box office blockbuster. He was now a STAR and the smash hits kept coming several Police Academy sequels, Short Circuit(1985) and its sequel, the Oscar-winning classic Ron Howard's Coccoon(Universal, 1985) whose pool scene established him as a minor sex symbol, and finally the massive blockbuster Three Men and a Baby(Disney, 1987). Director\/writer Curtis Hanson then cast him in the excellent Hitchcockian thriller The Bedroom Window(1987) alongside another young star of the time Elizabeth McGovern who had made a major impact in Ragtime(Paramount, 1981). Now he was a full-fledged star of a Top A quality film. This excellent thriller will keep you glued to screen. Hanson's taut direction, the gorgeous cinematography, and the excellent cast will hold your attention. The script has a couple holes but it is still very good. And Guttenberg who had a goofy face and could look geeky if not photographed carefully looks great so this should have been another feather in his cap. However this film tanked. Why I will never know. After this he would have one more big hit with Three Men and a Little Lady(Disney, 1990) and that was it. His career never recovered. Nonetheless his best films are definitely worth a look and The Bedroom Window is certainly among his best.

It was long before this Golden Age of Film Criticism that we are now living through, but, no matter. It what this learned Movie Reviewer had said in passing that was important to this write-up.What he said went something like that the Leads, Star Barbara Streisand(Dolly Levi) and Walter Matthau(Horace Vandergelder) ....were sort of like one of those old May West\/W.C.

A lot of folks hold that Mr. Fields had his true Golden Age during his association with Adolph Zukor, Jesse Lasky & Paramount Pictures. A great argument can be made for the Starring Vehicles of Fields, but for his guest starring during that time. The quality of story, writing, Direction(using some of Fields' favourites) and the sheer magnitude of sets and intricacy of their detailed construction gave a real true to life look to these Paramount gems (and to a picture, they were).A move from Paramount to Universal Studios would certainly be considered a come down in any quarters. For Paramount was, along with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, RKO Radio, Warner Brothers and 20th Century-FOX, called the big 5 of Hollywood, Universal was not so prestigiously endowed, though it didn't qualify as Poverty Row, either.To my way of thinking, it was the four MACK SENNET Productions\/PARAMOUNT Release of the 2 reelers that put W.C. Fields on the right track. The big four being THE DENTIST (1932) THE FATAL GLASS OF BEER,THE PHARMASCIST and THE BARBER SHOP(all 1933). In these he seemed to have the proper genesis of the crotchety guy who was also a victim of his environment.

I strive to find an outlet for the impending rant that bubbles inside me, and I strive to find words to express how strange and terrible and weird and awesome and awful 'Excalibur' is...but nothing comes forth save an incomprehensible rant. I'll start with some formal analysis....The film should have been two hours longer. The temporal pacing is so terrible and confusing that it eventually becomes funny, much like everything else in the film. The Grail quest for instance, could be its own film, but instead gets caught in a terrible twist in the timing of the film, and Boorman uses shots that are almost incomprehensible when compared with others in the rest of the film. Ten years pass in five minutes - and suddenly Lancelot, who I just saw two minutes ago as a dashing young lad - is bearded and reminds me of that one hobo who talked to himself in the Cousins on Oakland Avenue. You can't put your mind around that kind of senseless and terribly thought-out leap.The acting....the acting! How awful. Patrick Stewart and Liam Neeson and Helen Mirren turn in the low points of their professional careers - although Stewart and Neeson have about four lines put together, and you can just *tell* Stewart regards it as a joke - he just has that tone of voice that illustrates he's doing it for fun to have a story for the grandkids - Did I ever tell you about that *awful* Camelot movie I was in? Jesus, you kids should see it. Wait, nevermind, no you shouldn't. And Nicol Williamson's Merlin puts that same kind of inflection into every line - it sounds like he's doing the voice-over for a kid's TV show instead of a serious cinematic effort. And what was with that helmet? Was he a medieval amateur boxer? And when he falls into the river - good god almighty. That much camp should never be taken seriously, and obviously wasn't intended to be.And speaking of acting - someone please explain to me how the absolute WORST actor in the entire film ends up with the lead role? Nigel Terry, whose film acting is so bad he doesn't even have a photo on IMDb, can't deliver one single line right in the entire film - he blabbers through them all, and when he's required to put some bravado into a line he screams it at the top of his lungs like Arthur was on fire.All the scenes are so unintentionally funny - through terrible acting, ridiculous staging, Merlin (Merlin!), and verbal bastardization of what is actually a quality script. The film is devoid of emotion for all but three minutes, sapped of the stuff by the incompetent acting best demonstrated by newborns and hamsters. When Mordred beat Morgana to death - that was *funny*. I know the beating to death of a haggard old woman really shouldn't be, but...Christ, it never occurred to me in that scene that it was anything but a joke; it was carried out and acted so god awfully.As for Mordred, he was the only character who actually convinced me of his role, let alone of his portrayal. The golden armor was actually quite creepy and weird and scary, and the Come father, let us embrace at last line is delivered with such evil and venom that for a second I forgot about the other 99% of the movie - almost. Jesus, did I mention that toothless old lady got smacked around? Oh right, I did. And she vomited SMOKE. Good god, I'm rambling.And then there's the serious misuse of classical music, which could encompass an entire rant on its own - you never, NEVER fade out of a classical piece. Why? Because it was impossible to write them that way. And they fade out of 'O Fortuna' three or four times - god it makes me angry.But on the whole, no matter how awful and terrible and strange (at the risk of repeating myself) 'Excalibur' is, it is an absolute Camp masterpiece - every scene is unintentionally hilarious in some way, the lighting is consistently and rampantly awful, the sound is abbreviated and often poor, the acting (o god the acting), the staging, the pacing - it's all FUNNY. It's a movie that you watch and laugh and are embarrassed like you were seeing an episode of 'I Love Lucy,' but at least on 'ILL' the humor was intentional - here it's just...odd. And the scene where he finds the Holy Grail...well, you'll just have to witness it yourself. But not after you see the Grail scenes from 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' - just to put things in perspective. He was wearing a loin cloth. How the hell did that happen?

Patrick Stewart and Liam Neeson and Helen Mirren turn in the low points of their professional careers - although Stewart and Neeson have about four lines put together, and you can just *tell* Stewart regards it as a joke - he just has that tone of voice that illustrates he's doing it for fun to have a story for the grandkids - Did I ever tell you about that *awful* Camelot movie I was in? Jesus, you kids should see it. Wait, nevermind, no you shouldn't. And Nicol Williamson's Merlin puts that same kind of inflection into every line - it sounds like he's doing the voice-over for a kid's TV show instead of a serious cinematic effort. And what was with that helmet? Was he a medieval amateur boxer? And when he falls into the river - good god almighty. That much camp should never be taken seriously, and obviously wasn't intended to be.And speaking of acting - someone please explain to me how the absolute WORST actor in the entire film ends up with the lead role? Nigel Terry, whose film acting is so bad he doesn't even have a photo on IMDb, can't deliver one single line right in the entire film - he blabbers through them all, and when he's required to put some bravado into a line he screams it at the top of his lungs like Arthur was on fire.All the scenes are so unintentionally funny - through terrible acting, ridiculous staging, Merlin (Merlin!), and verbal bastardization of what is actually a quality script. The film is devoid of emotion for all but three minutes, sapped of the stuff by the incompetent acting best demonstrated by newborns and hamsters. When Mordred beat Morgana to death - that was *funny*. I know the beating to death of a haggard old woman really shouldn't be, but...Christ, it never occurred to me in that scene that it was anything but a joke; it was carried out and acted so god awfully.As for Mordred, he was the only character who actually convinced me of his role, let alone of his portrayal. The golden armor was actually quite creepy and weird and scary, and the Come father, let us embrace at last line is delivered with such evil and venom that for a second I forgot about the other 99% of the movie - almost. Jesus, did I mention that toothless old lady got smacked around? Oh right, I did. And she vomited SMOKE. Good god, I'm rambling.And then there's the serious misuse of classical music, which could encompass an entire rant on its own - you never, NEVER fade out of a classical piece. Why? Because it was impossible to write them that way. And they fade out of 'O Fortuna' three or four times - god it makes me angry.But on the whole, no matter how awful and terrible and strange (at the risk of repeating myself) 'Excalibur' is, it is an absolute Camp masterpiece - every scene is unintentionally hilarious in some way, the lighting is consistently and rampantly awful, the sound is abbreviated and often poor, the acting (o god the acting), the staging, the pacing - it's all FUNNY. It's a movie that you watch and laugh and are embarrassed like you were seeing an episode of 'I Love Lucy,' but at least on 'ILL' the humor was intentional - here it's just...odd. And the scene where he finds the Holy Grail...well, you'll just have to witness it yourself. But not after you see the Grail scenes from 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' - just to put things in perspective. He was wearing a loin cloth. How the hell did that happen?

I strive to find an outlet for the impending rant that bubbles inside me, and I strive to find words to express how strange and terrible and weird and awesome and awful 'Excalibur' is...but nothing comes forth save an incomprehensible rant. I'll start with some formal analysis....The film should have been two hours longer. The temporal pacing is so terrible and confusing that it eventually becomes funny, much like everything else in the film. The Grail quest for instance, could be its own film, but instead gets caught in a terrible twist in the timing of the film, and Boorman uses shots that are almost incomprehensible when compared with others in the rest of the film.

Admittedly, I found it rather underwhelming while I was watching it, and yet, the more I thought about it, the more I recognised the complexities of what had originally seemed a completely straightforward plot. In this brooding character study, Gene Hackman plays Harry Caul, the most respected surveillance expert in the business. In order to succeed at his job, Harry has learned to value a certain level of detachment from his victims, maintaining that his client's troubles are of no concern to him. Accordingly, Harry often distances himself from intimacy in his personal life, his only relationship being with a lonely woman named Meredith (Elizabeth MacRae), to whom he reveals nothing about himself.After Harry successfully records a quiet conversation between two people (Frederic Forrest and Cindy Williams) in a crowded courtyard, he begins to suspect that his surveillance may lead to their assassination. For the first time, he begins to question the ethics of his chosen field, eventually becoming actively involved in his client's issues. 'The Conversation' is probably most remarkable for its brilliant sound editing, mixing together recorded conversations, muffled words, microphone static and ambient sounds (it was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Sound category, but lost out to Mark Robson's 'Earthquake.'). By the end of the film, after his suspicions have proved him to be completely wrong in his assumptions, Caul has become paranoid and insecure. Being reputedly the best bugger in the business, he is finally forced to face that terrifying possibly what if there is somebody better than him?As Harry literally tears apart his apartment in search of the bug (notably, he doesn't look anywhere in his beloved tenor saxophone), the camera slowly and mechanically pans from right to left, just as a surveillance camera might do. This camera movement reinforces one of the Coppola's main themes just as Harry is a voyeur on the private lives of his subjects, we, the audience, are complicit in his deed. Indeed, we are surveilling Harry even in his most intimate moments, and the knowledge of this has permanently unhinged him, forcing him even to destroy his statue of the Virgin Mary, which symbolised the relics of his devout Catholicism. Gene Hackman is brilliantly understated in the main role, his brooding silence saying more than even the most colourful dialogue possibly could. We see him, complete detached from sharing his emotions, and we see and feel his loneliness.Hackman is also supported by a solid cast of talented actors, including John Cazale and Allen Garfield as fellow surveillance experts. Frederic Forrest and Cindy Williams play the young couple whose taped conversation forms the backbone of their story, and, through clever editing, it is remarkable how the meanings behind their words changes depending on the context in which it is heard (notably, one very important piece of dialogue, he'd kill us if he got the chance, was re-recorded for the climax, since preview audiences had difficulty picking up on the change in emphasis).
