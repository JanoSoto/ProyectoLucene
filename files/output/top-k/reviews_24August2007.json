I found myself almost in a state of shock and awe during the whole movie. Everything was perfect. The story was great, so simple yet so intriguing, the filming was pure genius and the originality was almost breathtaking. The film possess a unique erotic power that takes it away from being sleazy, but makes it beautiful and masterful.It is director David Lynch's disturbing, sensual, sickly funny masterwork Blue Velvet &#151; his defining film &#151; fascinated and repelled audiences on its release in 1986, and undoubtedly has left a lasting impact on both audiences and critics. Closer in tone to his freaky first film Eraserhead than to either his mainstream debut The Elephant Man or his follow-up fiasco Dune, audiences were simply unprepared for the experience. Although Lynch's distinctive style has become recognizable and less shocking over the years (and served as inspiration for such diverse directors as Quentin Tarantino, Jim Jarmusch, Todd Haynes, Gus Van Sant, Todd Solondz, Terry Gilliam, and the Coen brothers), at the time of its release it was stupendously shocking because there had never been a mainstream Hollywood film even remotely like it...it was the 'Psycho' if its time.The film centers clean-cut college student Jeffery Beaumount, who has recently found a human ear in a grass field while walking home from visiting his ill father in the hospital and discovers that beneath the Norman Rockwell suburbia lies ugliness and violence that is capable of corruption and destroying the towns innocence, once home to fresh-faced urchins who stay in the crosswalks, firemen merrily wave from their hook-and-ladder truck, red roses line brisk, white picket fences, and neighbors enjoy the blazing sunshine as they hose down their impossibly green lawns. The underworld eventually reveals some bizarre and depraved characters, one of whom, the beautiful Dorothy Vallens, is brutalized sexually by the man the kidnapped her husband, Frank Booth. The lethal adventure leads Jeffery to a violent, disturbing resolution and confrontation between the seemingly unstoppable Frank Booth.Repeated viewings of Blue Velvet will help first-timers, as it will become perhaps even more disturbing as things that were once obscure are better understood. Insane, ultra-violent Frank Booth, sucking God-knows-what from his oxygen mask and screaming Baby wants blue velvet! Baby wants to ^%#@! is a man in love &#151; as he watches Dorothy sing the title song in a run-down nightclub, he gently fondles the square of fabric that he cut from her robe when he sexually assaulted her earlier, tears running down his cheeks. This is amazing, and should be appreciated as a real masterwork in cinema history. Just take a look at its influence.
