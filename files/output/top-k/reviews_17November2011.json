The supporting cast is just perfect. I don't like Lisa Kudrow but she fits perfectly. Yeah it's typical and commercial but it still is funny and definitely highly entertaining.The people who voted this below 8\/10 are ppl who were looking for something closer to the Godfather - because objectively, as a comedy, there's no way this is an average or even slightly average comedy.

And decide to take a cruise, to relax. But an over-zealous & calmly crazy computer hacker, wants the ship for his own reasons, then it just gets crazier from there.There's a lot you can say about Speed 2 Cruise Control, but unless you detach yourself from the overwhelming love, appreciation and die-hard devotion to the original, than your going to hate this beyond belief. Let me say this movie is FAR from horrible, or the worst movie ever made seriously, sequels follow under 2 categories. A. returning characters\/places\/events in another installment. Or B. a movie in a similar vein as previous film. This movie is mostly B. (with a sprinkle of A.) Most sequels somehow come off great being all in the first category, no matter how unrealistic it is (c'mon every main character in a Hollywood movie is always in danger & never catches a break? get real) Just because Keanu isn't in this shouldn't be the first step to shooting this movie down.The decision to make this another speed adventure instead of the next chapter in the same storyline shouldn't be a deal breaker in itself either. They evolved a story (regardless of an actor coming back or not) and made an action flick. Its the same deal as a company working on another year of improving and changing, an executive can look at their product and see the reasons why they might need to change. But suddenly you ask a die hard fan who lets his feelings for the product get in the way, you wont get the same understanding of the change at all.That being said, you cant help but think yeah still though Speed was better no kidding. but before you say not enough shooting, explosions or battle of wits collide you gotta realize one thing about movies, setting & story dictate everything else in a movie (including how the action goes). So you take that away, Speed 2 if anything at all shows the importance of musical score & camera work, that can make or break a movie. The pacing of it all, does get cumbersome at times (the movie has more time for story development so they did it). **But if Speed 2 kept up the same camera work (angels, shots, cuts & editing) along with a more similar musical score to the original (more tension, less tropical) than most people would give this movie a 6.0 easy.At the end of the day Speed 2 is not as good as the original, in its own right its actually a decent escape from a lazy Saturday afternoon's boredum.*If you've actually watched badly made movies before then this is an easy 6.5 not horrible, but not great, just good. *If all you watch are top of the line, Oscar contenders or triple A grade action\/drama's then this should be about a 4.5 to a 5. ***If the first Speed was one of your top (10 or 15) favorite movies of all time, your better off pretending this doesn't exist, this isn't for you, don't watch it. (Now for those who think this is the worst piece of crap on the planet, trust me you haven't watched enough movies. go watch Chinango, Direct Contact, Deadly Prey & pretty much anything Billy Blanks made as a movie back in the 90's, then wish you had Those hours of your life back) ","genre":null},{"date":"17 November 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" So this movie takes place a few years down the road from Speed, And Sandra Bullock has found a man she thinks she can hang onto for a while -and is very excited as such- The guy, is Jason Patric, they want to get away from the hustle & bustle of life around L.A.
