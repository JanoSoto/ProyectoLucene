But at least the film is made by Michael Winterbottom whose movies, some brilliant and some not, at least have the merit that each one is quite unlike the others. Which means that some freshness is virtually guaranteed, and Witnerbottom tells this story in an irreverent, self-knowing fashion that is at least lively, although it does sometimes give the film the feel of low-budget sitcom. This feeling is also enhanced by the casting of comedian Steve Coogan, an actor of little depth, as Factory Records boss Tony Wilson. Like Coogan's famous alter-ego Alan Partridge Wilson was a TV presenter, but it is hard to tell whether he was quite as similar to Partridge as this film suggests, or if Coogan simply isn't up to the job of playing a different character. And the decision to tell the story of Wilson also seems strange he was not a kid whose life was transformed, or a singer whose songs were sung the world over he even kept his day job, and there's little underlying character development in his story. Rationally, this isn't a very good film, although it's actually quite watchable, and all the more so if you have lived through this era, and listened to the music as it was new. But there are lots of potentially interesting stories, like the death of Ian Curtis, or the wave of idealism that briefly flourished with the coming of Ecstasy, which could have been covered with a bit more feeling. This movie is fun, but perhaps also a wasted opportunity; others who revisit this era will surely have more to say.

It is a story of love like you have not seen or heard yet. It is also the film that is more connected to Poland, the mother-country of the director in the cycle.Karol is a Polish hairdresser who just at the beginning of the film is being divorced by his Frech wife on the worst possible reason for a man - not performing in bed. The two seem to be still in love, but they cannot communicate well, and Karol is left in the worst possible situation, without money, being obliged to return home illegally in a suitcase. What follows is very much similar to many East Europen films describing the transition of former Eastern Europe from Communism. In the desolated landscape of Poland everything goes, everything is possible, and Karol becomes fast a rich man. His dream is yet to win back his love. He will do it by simulating his own death, will win physically his love for a night, and then the story becomes something else - a story of revenge, which may or may not fit into the logic of the movie up to that point.The film is much more direct than other films of Kieslowski, maybe because the director wanted to say something about the fate of his country, but this is not in the same register and at the same level as the rest of the story and of the film. We can however enjoy here as well the color symbols of the series, with the white meaning not that much purity but the freezing cool of the Polish winter, with the red taking over in one of the final love scenes, connecting symbolically with the last film in the series. The best thing however in the movie is the amazing acting of Zbigniew Zamachowski in the role of Karol. Zamachowski carries the full intensity of unaccomplished love, desperation, will to win the love back and take revenge maybe not so much on people as on fate for the whole duration of the film.

Basically street-wise teenager Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) convinces his parents, mother Katie (Cindy Pickett) and father Tom (Lyman Ward), that he has a serious illness forcing him to stay home and miss a school test. In reality he is faking to take the day off, and he has plenty of tricks, gizmos and back-ups to make sure he has little chance of getting caught. To make his nice spring day much more enjoyable he needs his best friend Cameron Frye (Speed's Alan Ruck) and girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) to join him. Knowing how often he has been absent from school, overly suspicious Dean Ed Rooney (Beetle Juice's Jeffrey Jones) knows Ferris well, and he wants to catch him in the act this time. Ferris, Cameron and Mia meanwhile have taken the convertible Ferrari 250 GT California, beloved by Cameron's father, to have a city adventure in Chicago. In the day they take the Ferrari to a garage with two untrustworthy attendants, eat at a fancy restaurant stealing someone else's reservation, watch a ball game, visit an art gallery, and take part in an annual parade. The parents have been fooled by Ferris's contraptions and stuff to thinking he is still at home in bed, but Rooney is going to all lengths to prove he isn't. So he goes to one or two places before going to the Bueller residence to find Ferris himself, and suffering all the humiliations of the house, e.g. mud, the dog. After a long day, Ferris, Cameron and Mia take the Ferrari back, but Cameron decides when it gets damaged, oh, and goes speeds backwards down the hill, to stand up to his father. Also seen in the story by the way is Ferris's sister Jeanie (Dirty Dancing's Jennifer Grey) who is resentful and jealous of Ferris, because he gets away with loads and she doesn't. In the end, Ferris races home to be there at the time his father said he would return, and when it looks like Rooney has busted, Jeanie backs him up and he gets away with it all. Also starring Edie McClurg as Grace, young Charlie Sheen as Boy in Police Station, The Mask's Ben Stein as Economics Teacher and Kristy Swanson as Simone Adamley. I love teen movies like American Pie, and this is considered by many as the ultimate skiving film, and with great performances by Broderick, Ruck and Jones, and early appearances by Grey and Sheen, it is good fun comedy.

I love teen movies like American Pie, and this is considered by many as the ultimate skiving film, and with great performances by Broderick, Ruck and Jones, and early appearances by Grey and Sheen, it is good fun comedy.

Basically street-wise teenager Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) convinces his parents, mother Katie (Cindy Pickett) and father Tom (Lyman Ward), that he has a serious illness forcing him to stay home and miss a school test. In reality he is faking to take the day off, and he has plenty of tricks, gizmos and back-ups to make sure he has little chance of getting caught. To make his nice spring day much more enjoyable he needs his best friend Cameron Frye (Speed's Alan Ruck) and girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) to join him. Knowing how often he has been absent from school, overly suspicious Dean Ed Rooney (Beetle Juice's Jeffrey Jones) knows Ferris well, and he wants to catch him in the act this time. Ferris, Cameron and Mia meanwhile have taken the convertible Ferrari 250 GT California, beloved by Cameron's father, to have a city adventure in Chicago. In the day they take the Ferrari to a garage with two untrustworthy attendants, eat at a fancy restaurant stealing someone else's reservation, watch a ball game, visit an art gallery, and take part in an annual parade. The parents have been fooled by Ferris's contraptions and stuff to thinking he is still at home in bed, but Rooney is going to all lengths to prove he isn't. So he goes to one or two places before going to the Bueller residence to find Ferris himself, and suffering all the humiliations of the house, e.g. mud, the dog. After a long day, Ferris, Cameron and Mia take the Ferrari back, but Cameron decides when it gets damaged, oh, and goes speeds backwards down the hill, to stand up to his father.

North.50's cinema saw many science fiction films, at the time a new genre of film, among them War of the Worlds Earth Vs The Flying Saucers, Invasion Of The Body Snatchers and Forbidden Planet. Director Robert Wise's The Day The Earth Stood Still was adapted from a short story by Harry Bates entitled Farewell To The Master. Released in 1951, it is a classic, iconic early science fiction film. The image of the tall, strong and steel-made robot Gort has remained in the minds of science fiction lovers for generations. Versatile, dramatic actor Michael Rennie stars as Klaatu, a human male inhabitant of another planet, seemingly perfect and free of war. A spaceship lands in Washington D.C. and stirs the fears of the entire nation. Klaatu poses as a resident of the capital, Mr. Carpenter and befriends Bobby (Billy Gray), the son of a single working mother Helen Benson (Patricia Neal). But Helen's boyfriend, Tom (Hugh Marlowe) mistrusts the new stranger and believes he is the alien enemy. But Klaatu is far from hostile, he comes from a peaceful planet after all. His message to the human population of earth cease production of nuclear weapons made for destruction and war. At the time of this film, there was a huge scare in America the Communist threat and nuclear war. While Communist threat is no longer an issue, nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction is still very much an issue in our world today. The situation in Korea with the dictator Kim Jong-il for example and President Bush's quest to find weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. This film is not just science fiction. At one level it is composed of the classic, campy, science fiction of 50's comic books that feature giant robots with destructive powers, the threat of an invasion from aliens and so forth. But at another level it's a social commentary on the insecurities and anxities Americans had because of Communism and the fear of nuclear war. In Hollywood, several film makers were blacklisted as Communists during the McArthy Era which was the time of this film. This is exactly why Klaatu is for the most part in the role of Mr. Carpenter a friendly but strange newcomer in America, almost suggestive of an immigrant from a country that is a socialist\/Communist Utopia. Audiences must have been quick to see the message because the film does not follow conventional science fiction movie film plots. There are no heroes or villains, just a message. The ending is a huge disappointment as there is no real resolution to the film nor much action. Klaatu warns the humans of earth to cease the making of nuclear arms and then returns home on his spaceship with Kort the killer robot. This must be seen as a film of its time and not judged by today's science fiction. The acting is also very much in following with the melodramatic, almost radio drama type of material. Patricia Neal as Helen, for example, is a character straight out of radio drama. It's interesting to note how she is not a housefrau, but a single working mother and she even refuses to marry Tom when he decides to report Klaatu to the authorities, this at a time of famous 50's housewives. There are other nice touches. For instance, the musical score by Bernard Hermann. It is a very eerie music and suited to science fiction of this time. This is a short, enjoyable film and a must see for science fiction buffs.

It is, I think, the best costume picture I have ever seen. OK, The Leopard is greater, and Barry Lyndon might also be, but what company! The book is of course wonderful source material, but that doesn't guarantee greatness as a film; and the film has a sensuality, a tactile, flowing quality, that is utterly remarkable. Every vase on the bureau, painting on the wall, teapot on the table seems to have been chosen with meticulous care, and the whole thing feels lived in too; the camera roams the walls or the gallery at the opera the way our eyes might. Sublime. This is what I was hoping for when Scorsese labored for years on Gangs--a lovingly detailed, completely sensual immersion in the past. Didn't happen that time. But why this movie isn't on the shortlist of great literary adaptations I will never understand. It's a master filmmaker at his most fluid, and (as another reviewer on IMDb presciently put it) Visconti-like.I first saw this film at its (world?) premiere at the Venice Film Festival in 1993. As just a normal plebe, I couldn't score a ticket for the daytime screening on the Lido, but as I waited to see something else I saw the European cinejournalists coming out, all looking nonplussed. I talked to a few of them, and all of them said it was boring and offered criticism along the lines of he just filmed the book. Nonetheless, I went later that week to an outdoor nighttime screening for the public at the Campo Santo Stefano (if I'm not mistaken), and from the opening shots of the blooming flowers across that widescreen space, I was truly captivated. But I must admit that I didn't fully trust my feelings about the film--the later American reviews seemed to echo the ones of the Euro journalists, and I wondered if it was seeing this film so far from home in a foreign location that had made it so vivid for me. But I saw it again about 12 years later and it came into focus just how great it really is, critics be damned. This is a film that gets better and better with age, especially since we're not surrounded by Merchant\/Ivory style films like we were then, or rather nowadays they've all been Weinsteined into star vehicles for Gwyneth or Keira. Just as in that wonderful earlier comment on this thread by Jess Fink, I am happy\/sad to see the film get so much love on this board. I had assumed there were so few of us, and we'd have 40 years in the wilderness before the world would catch on.Day-Lewis is terrific, as is most of the supporting cast, but the reason I can't give this a perfect 10--the only flaws I can think of--are the performances of the leading ladies. Pfeiffer has some good moments, but I think she is unable to fully carry off the complexity of the role. On second viewing, Ryder's performance seemed less stiff than I remembered from the initial viewing, but I do think she's also a little overmatched by the incredible actors around her. She makes a good effort though.A terrific film that will help round out your understanding of this great director.

If you enjoy enchanting stories, this film fills that need. If you prefer period pieces, the costumes, scenery and music will whisk you back to the turn of the 20th Century. Finally, if you enjoy a movie that leaves you thinking long after the credits have run, this movie does so. It leaves you questioning everything you've just seen, while appreciating everything you've just heard.The Legend of 1900 is about an orphan boy who is abandoned aboard a luxury ocean liner at the start of the 20th Century. Reared in the underbelly of the ship by one of its workers, he is named Danny Boodmann T.D. Lemon 1900 after his adopted father, the lemon box he was found it and the year he was born. Nicknamed 1900, he soon discovers his natural talent as a pianist and gains notoriety as the ship's piano player. He befriends a traveling saxophone player. The film is told through the sax player's eyes.While 1900 has never left the confines of the ship, he is not a hermit. He is widely visible and much beloved. He gains fame by beating renowned Jazz pianist Jelly Roll Morton in a duel. But no fame can remove him from his home. As such, we see 1900 as a man of limited experiences; not little experience. He has experienced friendship, if fleeting. He has experienced love, if only for a moment. He has experienced celebrity status, if barely outside the boat. It is a contemporary tale of a confined genius whose home is a ship, the sea and his music. The simplicity with which he lives does not mask his talent, it simply binds it.There are two things that make this movie better than it should be. The first is the music. While a movie about a piano prodigy should have a great soundtrack, the beauty is that the entire score is the story of 1900's life. We are told early on that 1900 writes what he sees. He writes music to complement the actions of the travelers. At times the soundtrack seems to follow the same pattern. The music is not just a peripheral element. It is part of his character. The music accompanies the movie just as it has accompanied 1900 through his entire life.The second piece that makes this movie work is the story-telling feel. We truly feel that the only way 1900 will be remembered is if his story continues to be told. We believe that not only will the saxophone player further his story, but so will the countless travelers who have come into contact with him. While 1900 comes across as reserved and timid at times, his talent will make him stand out even more than he would want. Though his only recording may have been destroyed, by word of mouth, his legacy will live on.Tim Roth has a talent for giving emotional performances with a quiet grace that does not overwhelm the scene. He seems to let the character's actions speak for themselves. In Rob Roy, Roth's character is soft spoken, yet his actions are powerful and revolting. As an audience, we would still despise his character even if he never opened him mouth. And his dark eyes seem to project a character that has something to hide. Whether intentional or unintentional, Roth projects a character that is deeper and more complex than he lets on.1900 is that type of character. As a piano player, 1900 has always expressed himself through his music. Apart from the piano, his actions seem slow and deliberate. His words are simple and carefully chosen, even rehearsed at times. We go through much of the film not knowing what makes him tick. At times he seems scarred by a life at sea. At times he seems completely at peace. At times we feel sorry for him. Other times we applaud him. Such is The Legend of 1900.

He gains fame by beating renowned Jazz pianist Jelly Roll Morton in a duel. But no fame can remove him from his home. As such, we see 1900 as a man of limited experiences; not little experience. He has experienced friendship, if fleeting. He has experienced love, if only for a moment. He has experienced celebrity status, if barely outside the boat. It is a contemporary tale of a confined genius whose home is a ship, the sea and his music. The simplicity with which he lives does not mask his talent, it simply binds it.There are two things that make this movie better than it should be. The first is the music. While a movie about a piano prodigy should have a great soundtrack, the beauty is that the entire score is the story of 1900's life. We are told early on that 1900 writes what he sees. He writes music to complement the actions of the travelers. At times the soundtrack seems to follow the same pattern. The music is not just a peripheral element. It is part of his character. The music accompanies the movie just as it has accompanied 1900 through his entire life.The second piece that makes this movie work is the story-telling feel. We truly feel that the only way 1900 will be remembered is if his story continues to be told. We believe that not only will the saxophone player further his story, but so will the countless travelers who have come into contact with him. While 1900 comes across as reserved and timid at times, his talent will make him stand out even more than he would want. Though his only recording may have been destroyed, by word of mouth, his legacy will live on.Tim Roth has a talent for giving emotional performances with a quiet grace that does not overwhelm the scene. He seems to let the character's actions speak for themselves. In Rob Roy, Roth's character is soft spoken, yet his actions are powerful and revolting. As an audience, we would still despise his character even if he never opened him mouth. And his dark eyes seem to project a character that has something to hide. Whether intentional or unintentional, Roth projects a character that is deeper and more complex than he lets on.1900 is that type of character. As a piano player, 1900 has always expressed himself through his music. Apart from the piano, his actions seem slow and deliberate. His words are simple and carefully chosen, even rehearsed at times. We go through much of the film not knowing what makes him tick. At times he seems scarred by a life at sea. At times he seems completely at peace. At times we feel sorry for him. Other times we applaud him. Such is The Legend of 1900.

I was only 9 when it was released and my parents never bought or rented it, so I was just thinking of the movie when I saw it on I love the 90's on VH1 and rented it along with the sequel. I have to say that normally a Keanu Reeves movie is only sometimes enjoyable to watch, but this was a very exciting action movie, in fact one of the best I've seen. I know that it was very over the top and a little silly, but it was just so much fun to watch.Keanu plays Jack, a police officer who has just foiled another crime by EVIL mastermind Dennis Hopper. When Dennis gets very upset, he plants a bomb on a bus, the only way to prevent it from going off is to keep the bus going 50 miles an hour or above. Jack jumps onto the bus and tries to explain, but a criminal thinks he is after him so he pulls out his gun and accidentally shoots the bus driver leaving the driving to a passenger, Annie. They must go on a driving spree to make sure that everyone can stay alive with trying to figure out a way off the bus.Speed is a very great action movie that everyone needs to see, it's just one of those movies that really gets you excited and never lets you go. Keanu and Sandra did a terrific job and had great chemistry, despite their cheesy over the top kiss, it was definitely needed to complete the cliché action genre. I think you'll love this movie if you just like films in general.

It is a ridiculous story approached with deadly seriousness on the part of the main characters, so serious in fact that it becomes amusing.So, yes, 'Batman & Robin' is campy. And that's how I like the Caped Crusader. Taken seriously, I find him a bit of a bore. So many modern movies are 'dark' now that I have to take a flashlight every time I visit the local multiplex. 'B & R' was the third sequel to the 1989 Tim Burton blockbuster, which starred Michael Keaton. Both left the series at the same time. Their replacements were Joel Schumacher and Val Kilmer. Schumacher retained the dark, brooding atmosphere of the Burton films, while bringing in some of the colourful campery of the '60's series. He was ripped to pieces for doing so but I think he was right. Kilmer was an adequate replacement. George Clooney donned the cowl and cape for 'B & R ', and was better than Kilmer, but Keaton was still far and away the best. Warner Bros.' 'Batman' franchise was bound to run out of puff, and did. All franchises run out of puff in the end. James Bond did with 'The Man With The Golden Gun' in 1974. The less said about 'Superman 4 The Quest For Peace' the better. But they both recovered. Ditto 'Batman'. 'Batman Begins' could never have been made were it not for 'B & R '. The plot concerns 'Mr.Freeze' who is trying to save his dying wife by freezing Gotham City...something like that. It is not important. People who go to 'Batman' in search of great plots are fools.Arnold Schwarzenegger was miscast as 'Mr.Freeze' - the man cannot, and never could, act. Patrick Stewart should have gotten the role. Then there's Uma Thurman as 'Poison Ivy', a villain I'm not familiar with, but she was the best thing in the movie. Sexy, sassy and cool. This was how she should have been in 'The Avengers'. Alicia Silverstone as 'Batgirl'? Another mistake. 'Batgirl' is to 'Batman' what 'Scrappy Doo' is to 'Scooby Doo'.

For those of us who fondly remember the '60's version, it works perfectly as a homage. If you ask me, they should have gone further by putting 'Pow!', 'Zap!' and 'Kerpow!' on the fights. Nothing in the movie makes sense, nor is it meant to. Just as reality makes no sense. Don't go to 'B & R' expecting Fellini, and you'll have a great time. The opening chase alone is worth purchasing the D.V.D. for. To all the doom mongers, I say this - lighten up! Watch 'B & R' and enjoy. We can get 'dark' and 'edgy' movies anywhere.

A film that speaks about loneliness, grieving and death, which leaves you with a feeling of premonition, knowing that the director died a few years later leaving so many films undone.This is the story of Julie acted by Juliette Binoche who loses her husband, a famous composer and young daughter in a car accident. After an unsuccessful tentative of suicide she leaves the house where she was living with her family and moves to Paris. In fact she is not sure what to do with her life, she does not know how to cope with the loss, she does not even know if she is capable of feeling anything any longer. While life goes on around her she seems to become kind of a spectator, tries to forget and disconnect from memories in order to alleviate the grieving. Even discovering that her husband had an affair with another woman who is expecting a child from him does not really shake her, although this seems to trigger a process of returning to reality. Will she close the circle?

After an unsuccessful tentative of suicide she leaves the house where she was living with her family and moves to Paris. In fact she is not sure what to do with her life, she does not know how to cope with the loss, she does not even know if she is capable of feeling anything any longer.

His lack of emotion and repetitiveness in his mannerisms, speech and emotions were highly accurate. (A few reviewers criticized him for lacking emotion, but this is exactly how mentally retarded autistic individuals behave.) Incidentally, 75% of people with autism are also mentally retarded.Hoffman's Raymond was not high functioning as the film doctor said. (Another astute reviewer mentioned this also.) He was mentally retarded with a small portion of his brain having savant ability for mathematics.Hoffman's character had substandard intellectual and cognitive skills (couldn't perform simple math questions) and poor adaptive behavior (his interaction with the prostitute and his inability to discuss subjects intelligently or even simplistically). These are the 2 criteria for mental retardation along with the disability occurring before the age of 3.My only complaint with this otherwise outstanding film was the scene where Hoffman and Cruise stopped at the rural house so that Hoffman's character could watch a TV show. The scene should have been cut as it was not realistic.

It does start a little slow with the opening credits and an elevator shaft, but the music is what keeps me interested. It then moves to the scene where the great villain, Howard Payne (a great Dennis Hopper) has planted a bomb on an elevator and held people inside ransom for $3.7m, and the heroes, Officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and Det. Harold 'Harry' Temple (Jeff Daniels, in a serious role, cool) manage to save the hostages, while Payne escapes. But it is not over for Traven, not long later he sees a bus explode, and is told on a near public phone that there is a bus with a bomb on it. If it goes over 50mph it is set, but if it goes below 50mph, it blows, and if anyone besides him gets off, he blows it. It is now a race against time, before 11pm, to figure some way to stop the bomb, or save the passengers, including revoked driver Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock), who returned in the sequel. Oh, and when they do stop it, it concludes with a speeding train chase. There are some fantastic twists in this adrenalin filled high action thriller. Also starring Terminator 2's Joe Morton as Capt. McMahon, Alan Ruck as Stephens, Saw II's Glenn Plummer as Jaguar Owner, Richard Lineback as Norwood, Beth Grant as Helen, Hawthorne James as Sam and Carlos Carrasco as Ortiz. It won the Oscars for Best Sound Effects Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing, and it won the BAFTAs for Best Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Special Effects. Dennis Hopper was number 80 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 49 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 99 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Outstanding!
