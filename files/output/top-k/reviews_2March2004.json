Waters is one of those guys who creates things that 95% of the world will hate.  Not so that he'll sell tickets to the 5% who don't hate it, but so that he can wink and nod to the 1% who love it.  It's all about separating themselves from the flock and standing firm against mediocrity and boring suburban white people and rolling your eyes at anyone who doesn't get it.Yes, it's all very precious saying well if you don't understand it I'm certainly not explaining it to you, but that's just to give Waters and his little clique a tiny thrill at one-upping people in the cultural coolness department.Hey, if you want to set yourself apart from the normals how about creating something brilliant?  I know.  It's hard.  But try integrity and precision over irreverence and cheese sometime.  You might like what you get.Why aren't I talking about the film? its characters? the plot? the directorial decisions? the acting?  Because it does not matter.  This is a weird movie.  It's intended to be weird first, weird second and weird third. Nowhere on anyone's list was the notion of storytelling or communication with the audience written or scribbled hastily as it were a memo to oneself. They only wanted to be bizarre and you know what?  They succeeded.  Way to go.So my recommendation... If you're into watching movies that are off-beat for the sake of being off-beat, then have to.  If you care a whit about story, keep your distance.  Also, if you meet John Waters, set his hair on fire. Tell him it was from me.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"2 March 2004","score":"","review":" First of all, I would like to make a few comments about some of the other comments on the movie First of all, it was actually intentional that Brad Pitt seem somewhat cocky & ne'er-do-well in his role; the point of his character was that he most likely came from a smallish town's precinct where the hardest crime was probably stealing from the collection plate, and his attitude was looked up to. In a small town. He, in their minds, had the attitude of those movie & TV cops. In L.A., an attitude doesn't even get you a latte. So his bravado is supposed to be misplaced. But what does come through is the fact that he honestly does want to do the right thing his own way, and get the bad guys & teach them some manners, usually with a lot of verbal & some physical abuse. Typical small-town, or rent-a-cop, mindset. Secondly, a lot of people claim that the gore was hard to take...WHAT gore? We only see the aftermath of the murders, not what they go through. And what they go through is only speculated upon, not hard-cold fact. The gore is in the mind of the audience. Frankly I am quite please that they took that approach, as it shows that the writers, producers, directors are giving the audience SOME credit for having minds & imaginations. Hollywood thinking their audience has a few brain cells--go figure... To sum up my feelings on the movie, I have to quote the artistic director, Rob Bottin, on this one--This is a script that definitely gave me the butt-willies! From beginning almost to the end, I was impressed by not only the idea, but the approach to such an idea. And a haunting thought occurred to me...why hasn't this ever been done before in real life? Or has it, but was not clued in to? Not that I'm hoping this is so, of course!! I think that given the circumstances, the victims were actually handled with dignity. So many times in movies, the victims are exploited because most of Hollywood thinks that we only want shock and after-death scandals. Here, there was no dirty laundry airing, no contrite bloodletting...just the sad fact that they were everyday people in everyday lives (whether we want to admit it or not), and chosen to fit a specific killer's agenda. Much like most other serial killers. Morgan Freeman, as usual, does no wrong, and brings a quiet grandness to his role (and every role). Brad Pitt, with the aforementioned background character, holds his own and does a pretty impressive job to get most of us to forget that he's known for his looks alone. Gwyneth Paltrow isn't given much to do, but she does it amiably. And R. Lee Ermey, as always, is a comic-relief treat (ring...This is not even my desk! slam!). Plus, how much fun was it for us to see Shaft as the governor?? One minor flaw I feel compelled to say, and this is just my opinion Not the actor portraying him, but the character of John Doe, left me a little dry. When he first arrived in the station, his character seemed to fit with all that was discovered in his apartment. But once he started talking, he fell into the same old Hollywood Killer mode. Giving away all of his motives and intentions and thought processes right before the end. This contriteness is in EVERY killer movie, and was a sore disappointment. For me. Personally, I would have preferred not to have him speak at all, or very minimally. Case in point, at the very end when Mills has the gun on him and Somerset rushes up after receiving the box. Doe goes into saying what his role is in the 7 deadly sins, and what Mills' role will be as well...Hasn't that been implied already?? We KNOW who will be what sin, just by the set-up! And there's only two left--I think we can tell who is which! Sorry, but Hollywood--take note, please - we don't need every killer's life story, motives, and intentions spoon-fed to us. Besides, with everything only being implied in the rest of the film, having John Doe go into such a self-serving diatribe really goes against the grain, and gives the feel of the film a 180 turn...which makes it all the more sad when the first hour & 45 minutes have proved that the writers, et al, have the intelligence to not stoop to that level. However that is my only beef with the film. The rest; above par, superb, magnificent, and a must-see...that you will be seeing in your conscious and subconscious for a long while after the film ends.

It is worthy of its' Oscars and is based on a true story. The music can be haunting and beautiful at the same time. Vangelis is a musical genius. The cast is stellar with some new faces of actors and actresses like Alice Krige and even Ruby Wax if you look closely. The 1924 Olympics is the climax of the film. It's still a beautiful and wonderfully entertaining and educational film to be seen. I loved the cast including Sir Ian Holm, Sir John Gielgud, and the young aspiring Olympic athletes including Brad Davis, Ian Charleson, and Ben Cross. The story is beautifully told in writing and the direction is brilliant to convey the beauty of the story. This is a feel good classic film from 1981.

He wants to go back, most notably to see Debi (Minnie Driver). Debi is a high school flame that Cusack's Martin Blank ditched on prom night for reasons the film never really explains. Everyone in this cast is perfect in the role. Cusack plays his hitman as a straight laced yuppie instead of the psycho you would think. Driver is so wonderful you have no problem believing that Cusack would still carry a torch all these years. Dan Akyrord pops up as a hitman following Blank to attempt to get Blank to join a hitman's union- hilarious stuff. Jeremy Piven plays Cusack's best HS friend. Joan Cusack plays his secreatry. Hank Azaria co-stars as a cop tailing Martin and many other shine in this great comedy.

The humor goes from clever to pure slapstick but always manages to be funny.The most fascinating thing about this movie is that it improves upon each  look. After the first time I saw it, I thought that it was great, the next time, I thought it was even better. I've seen it six times now, and it  just keeps on improving.

The laughs keep coming as Jack and his family spend the summer at the beach with many mishaps occurring throughout the movie.  The movie is about family and new friends pulling together, working side by side, believing in a dream and achieving an impossible goal.  We've watched this movie many times, but we still laugh and feel good when the movie ends.

When Disney is doing PG-rated animated features these days, why do they have to throw in some gross-out humor, that would make the creators of The Garbage Pail Kids blush? Or why are they STILL trying to do some sickening sweet swill films ever since The Little Mermaid? I really love this film and here is why1. NO BROADWAY-ESQUE SONGS!2. Dark, yet lovely animation.3. The hero and heroine are actually IMPERFECT children, unlike most Disney films, where the heroes are usually perfect teenagers or adults.4. Scary evil villains. The villains are not hammy or comical this time around, making a homage to the old films.5. John Hurt does the voice of the evil demon king, enough said there!I just pray that Disney learns to make more films like this and less like Lilo and Stitch and Treasure Planet.
