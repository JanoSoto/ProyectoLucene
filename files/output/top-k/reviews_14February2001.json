I was surprised that the movie makers were allowed to be as candid as they were back in 1962.  For example, Kirstin holding her breasts and telling her husband she can't drink because she is nursing.  But the most astonishing scene was when in a drunken stupor she slips into her father's bed and tries to seduce him!  Nobody talks much about that scene when discussing this movie.  Maybe because it is too painful to fathom, the fact that one could lose that much control on alcohol.  Are there any other movies about alcoholism that feature such a scene? I was in a marriage that had basically the same trajectory as the Clay marriage (no kids fortunately) except that alcohol was not the only partner (ahem).

It´s just a trip into the bizarre and the depth of the human soul - fearful and unpredictable. I personally think for example that Fred Madison, Pete Dayton and the Mystery Man are one and the same person - just on different levels of the mind. The most interesting fact about Lost Highway is, that you can explain Lynch´s work in many ways, but you will always miss the point somehow. Finally this movie can also be watched as a piece of modern art.

After Silence, Anthony Hopkins had become one of THE actors of the 90's (along with Kevin Spacey); with Gladiator, Ridley Scott had finally risen to the heights of Blade Runner again; and the prospect of seeing Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling filled my heart with joy.Therefore the result was all the more shocking - and really not because of the grossness of some scenes. As with so many horror movies, the gorier the scenes the less shocking the effect. Blood feasts like Dawn of the Dead and Man Eater are still hard to top, and Silence had certainly proven that you do not need blood and guts to drive the audience crazy.Therefore, what is really disturbing about Hannibal is the fact, that it is so surprisingly boring. Part of it certainly has to do with the fact that there is almost nothing new to the relationship between Hannibal and Clarice. And although I'm convinced that Julianne Moore is the better actress in comparison to Jodie Foster, she didn't bring anything interesting to her role. She's almost sleepwalking through the movie, sometimes with a gun in her hand, but psychologically there's almost nothing going on. (Compare that to the intensity of her pharmacy-scene in Magnolia, and you know what I was hoping for.) I'm sad to say that Jodie Foster was right in her decision not to come back.Even sadder is the development of Dr. Lecter He's become the hero, but does it make sense to have the audience root for a psychopath? In that respect, Silence was really brilliant, because you were terrified of Lecter, but you were also fascinated by him. It was a bizarre thing You hoped to see him again in order to be terrified of him. You just never knew what to expect from him. In Hannibal, Lecter has been degraded to a conventional horror figure, just short of Freddy Krueger, tossing out oneliners as if he was reborn as the evil brother of James Bond or the hyper-intelligent uncle of Arnold Schwarzenegger, a circus manager in charge of a freak show.Only therefore it's fitting that his counterpart is Mason Verger, the mousy-looking cripple who never becomes a real character. You don't feel his pain or his anguish, just think about the grueling make-up sessions Gary Oldman certainly had to endure. (All the more puzzling is the clearness of his voice - shouldn't we have more trouble understanding him?) Scott & Co. have made the horrible mistake of leaving out Verger's sister - one of the more involving subplots of the novel. This way, the Verger storyline is totally one-dimensional and you can't wait for someone to feed this creature to the pigs.Now any hope that the film might at least be great to look at (like almost every other Ridley-Scott-movie) is destroyed early on, during the first shoot-out, which mutilates the action into bits and pieces, and you don't get a sense of the scenery. Just as every action scene in Gladiator was masterfully choreographed with a sense for visual poetry, the action in Hannibal looks murky and uninspired. (And there's definitely too much music throughout the movie.) About the only good things in this film are the scenes in Florence, but maybe that's because Inspector Pazzi (the touching Giancarlo Giannini) is the only real character of the movie, the only person that conveys hints of thoughts and feelings. The rest is a disaster, including the all too obvious casting choice of Ray Liotta as Starling's simply slimy nemesis Paul Krendler. And last but not least Where the hell was Scott Glenn? His small role in Silence, where he played Starling's superior, was so vital to the balance of the story. And he was even more important in Hannibal, the novel.

Her character is by far the best of the film and this fact only makes you feel even more frustrated that they weren't able to do something better with it.However, there is still something about this film which for me sets it apart from the run-of-the-mill hollywood actioner and places it above average, if only just. It is something very subtle I can't quite put my finger on; it's a disturbing, cold, dark, even sickly edge, a nightmarish and unreal feel, a decadent air, a mean streak, which keeps cropping up in various ways. It's in the dark reddish photography and almost permanent night the characters dwell in, it's in Samantha's dreams in front of the mirror, it's in her vicious eyes and smile whenever she's about to kill a man or when she announces how she will enjoy watching her nemesis die with her daughter listening, it's in Mitch's comeback at the wheel of a car while he is spurting so much blood from his mouth he can hardly speak... I don't know, it's an atmosphere, something I can't define but which gives me the creeps (a bit) and which makes this film still oddly intriguing for me.

The baddies are remarkably unremarkable, and even Jackson's comic sidekick turn seems more like something from his pre-Pulp Fiction days; it looks like Harlin, as in Cutthroat Island, made every effort so that no-one would upstage his then wife.

Sure, this movie isn't an 'instant' WOW, but I can guarantee that over time this movie will surely grow to become a classic. Think about it.  The first time you saw SOTL, did you REALLY feel that it was as great as it was the 2nd, 3rd, 4th...time?  No!!  Give this movie a chance.  It is one of those movies that each time you watch it you will notice new things, new 'hidden' agendas and messages.Julianne Moore did an excellent job as Clarice and you don't even think for a moment that someone else used to play that role.  This movie definitely has potential.  For those of you that are looking to be handed every little detail, forget about it.  This movie leaves a lot to be thought about and as you leave the theatre, you will see what I mean.To me a good movie is one that leaves you thinking about it long after the closing credits.  Hannibal is just that movie.  For those of you that can't look deeper than the surface of a movie, there is always Saving Silverman. For those of you that need more from a movie, Hannibal is a sure bet.
