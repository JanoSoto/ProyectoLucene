When you let Kubrick have his way with a story like this one, you can almost guarantee success. The book is&#151;if possible&#151;even scarier than the movie version because there's a frightening topiary scene and a scarier subplot that Kubrick didn't or couldn't explore. But the movie is still one of the best horror flicks ever made. I think it works so well because the Torrence family is so isolated. They are essentially beyond help once the snows come, and if you've ever traveled on mountain roads on which you may run into a forest service gate blocking the roads in the winter, you know what that isolation feels like. Go past that gate, and they may never find you. So I think that's what is effective in the original book, and Kubrick masterfully employs that theme throughout (isolation of the family from society, isolation of the family members from one another, and isolation of the individual). Between Danny on the tricycle, dead twins, bleeding hallways, a creepy dead bartender, one of the scariest still photographs ever, the decaying chick in the bathtub, Jack hacking through the bathroom door, Dick getting axed in the chest, Wendy seeing Jack's novel, and the final scene with him frozen in the maze, the film has more than its share of scary moments.

Sissy Spacek was amazing, every scene with her in was special, she made Carrie White an emotionally-charged psycho. And what about Piper Laurie, she was just the most irreplacable character there will ever be, and I'm sure Sissy was scared of her just a tiny wee bit. The rest of the cast, Amy Irving, William Katt and Nancy Allen were amazing teens. I didn't like John Travolta's performance, it just lacked what the rest of the cast had going for them. Carrie has a sparkling script with added funny bits to remember it's a teen movie not a blood-sucking horror!! The moment Carrie gets soaked in blood, it's just so weirdly unreal to watch, ha ha.

This has to be the first movie of his I've seen that I actually really learned something from and left me wanting to make the world a better place. Maybe that seems stupid to some people, but knowing what Schindler did makes me believe that maybe one day I can help someone too.As for the black and white film, I think it fit beautifully. In the 30's and 40's there really wasn't a lot of color film used, especially for Journalism and the news. It fit with the time period very well. Also, the little girl in the red coat was a wonderfully sentimental touch. There actually was a little girl wearing a scarlet coat the day of the Karkow Liquidation that caught Schindler's eye and it completely disgusted him that people could commit such atrocities in front of a child. What happens later is symbolic of what was happening to the millions of people (Jewish, Gypsies, Homosexuals, etc.) and the fact that no one was standing up for them. The little girl and seeing her running through the crowd and what happens later helps to open up Schindler's eyes in the movie.Many people here have claimed that the character of Oskar Schindler was completely fabricated so that Sielberg could get some money. Fortunately enough for those 1,200 people, there was a real Schindler and he really did help them. He wasn't the best of men and he certainly had his faults. He drank excessively, he was a renowned womanizer, he supported slave labor, and he was a member of the Nazi party. . . but despite all that, he still did something good for other people. Oh, and contrary to what some people have claimed, while Schindler did in fact make a fortune during the war, he spent practically all of it to save the Jewish workers. He lost everything he had gained during the war to save them.Liam Neeson, I felt, did a great job portraying Schindler and Ralph Fiennes was brilliant as Amon Goeth. Fiennes in particular was rather frightening at how well he portrayed such a feared member of the Nazi party.There is a lot of nudity in the movie. Some people complain about that, but honestly, what do you expect? Do you really think that the Nazis told them that they'd turn away while they got changed? No. The nudity in the film (as portrayed by the Jewish and other victims) was necessary because it helps to demonstrate exactly what these poor people had to endure.In closing, don't listen to all the negative reviewers out there claiming it's bad because of nudity, Spielberg, or any other number of things.

You would also think that at some point of the rest of the film, she would dress up but the character of Jamie stayed true to herself. Also Shane West's character Landon was a pleasure to watch as his character transforms and he falls in love with Jamie. Their chemistry is so amazing.

Its a controversial examination of the exploits, simultaneously humorous and poignant, of a coterie of Scottish drug addicts. Amazingly enough, this is only the second directorial effort from Danny Boyle after his acclaimed debut, Shallow Grave(1994). Shot entirely on location in the capital of Scotland, Edinburgh, it revolves around six key characters--Mark, Francis, Sickboy, Spud, Tommy and Diane. The film is narrated by Ewan McGregor's central character, Mark rent-boy Renton, who decides to change his self-destructive lifestyle. His struggle to quell his heroin addiction subsequently effects his relationship with his family and drug-addled friends. Some will extol the film's unsettling and harsh depiction of a gang of drug junkies whereas others will rebuke the film for glorifying and advocating drug use.'Trainspotting' is like modern-day Clockwork Orange in terms of temperament and setting, as it were. There are a few scenes that are somewhat reminiscent of 'Clockwork Orange' but aren't necessarily identical. In essence, its a film about youth culture as well as drugs. and its incredibly funny. Its not easy to watch, though. Its not for the squeamish, that's for sure. There are really disturbing images that will haunt the viewer days, if not weeks, after seeing the film. I've seen a lot of great drug-themed films(ex 'The Man With The Golden Arm', 'Drugstore Cowboy', 'Down to The Bone' and 'Requiem for A Dream' immediately come to mind), Trainspotting joins the list. I don't know if its the best one out of the bunch, but I like it the most. Its a rather strange film in the sense that there's no concrete story. A great deal happens inside the character's head and some of it is quite disturbing. Only toward the end is there a semblance of a chronological narrative. Boyle deserves credit for eschewing social realism because the film isn't as depressing as a result. Instead of basking in the depravity of the characters, he has chosen to celebrate the prosperity of life, even in the hardships of these junkies.The performances are simply exceptional through and through. As the flawed yet redeemable Mark Renton, Ewan McGregor turns in an outstanding performance, probably the finest of his entire career. He reportedly went to extremes, like Christian Bale did for The Machinist, to make his character look more believable as far as physical appearance was concerned. Bravo!. The great Robert Carlyle, however, owns the film as the alcoholic, violent, mercurial psychotic, Francis Begbie. He exudes a sense of danger and ominousness whenever he appears on screen. Its a shame that this brilliant, chameleon-like actor has never received an Oscar nomination. Its been long overdue after so many great performances in his career. Johnny Lee Miller, despite the brevity of his role, gives an excellent performance as the James Bond-loving heroin addict, Sickboy. There are other performances well worth mentioning as well. Ewen Bremner is quite superb as the funny nitwit, Spud. Kevin McKidd really shines as Tommy, a drug-free but curious athlete. Kelly MacDonald makes a stellar acting debut as the lovable Diane, the voice of reason for Mark Renton. James Cosmo and Eileen Nicholas are effective as Mark Renton's parents.Technically, the film is really top-notch. Besides the uniformly great performances, the film has a great script, solid screenplay by John Hodge(received Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay), clever editing, arresting cinematography, sharp and witty dialogs. The narration by Ewan McGregor is excellent and helps propel the story. The direction by Danny Boyle is truly superb. The soundtrack and innovative techniques really add to the film's drug-soaked atmosphere as well. Trainspotting is a film that will age well. After 11 years, its still as powerful and influential as ever. One of the classic chronicles of addiction. Make seeing this film a priority.

However, the use of the term masterpiece is being thrown around so casually today as to render the word virtually meaningless. If you look at IMDb's user rating, you would find Citizen Kane ranked #23 and The Shawshank Redemption #2. This is a rating by us common folk, not people who have studied film or make their living from movies. Does this give rise to the contention that The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece also? One may argue the point, and if you read through the user comments, many, many people use the term to describe that movie. I'm sure if you read through the user comments for, say, Pulp Fiction, that ol' word masterpiece will be there again and again. Check out Forrest Gump. I haven't, but my money says you see that m word quite a few times there also. After all, it DID win six Academy Awards. If all these movies are considered masterpieces by enough people, does that make it so? I really don't know. I do have my opinion and the privilege to state it, everyone else like it or not. You may disagree with my view, but you shouldn't absorb it and react personally. A masterpiece in film is no different from any other art form.

In fact, in my opinion, Citizen Kane is not even Welles' best movie, so I must think highly of him as a filmmaker. Kubrick, Bunuel, Wilder, Ford, Fellini, Fassbinder, Lang, Ozu, Truffaut, Kurasawa, Hitchcock, Altman, maybe Goddard, maybe Herzog, look out for Tarr, Visconti, the list of great films by great filmmakers is long enough, but not so long that every GOOD film we see is a masterpiece.

The more i watched it, i began to love it even more. Johnny Depp gives one of his best performances here, another one-of-a-kind role for him.

Some may find the boldness of the colors a bit odd, but I love it as it makes it look better than real-life--like a fantasy world.The music is amazing--bold, exciting and grand. Subtle? Nah. For this film it's lots of fanfare and a grandness that perfectly match the film.The cast is amazing...absolutely amazing. They gave Flynn the best and most perfect lady for his love in the form of Olivia DeHavilland. This was a very good choice, as she starred in Flynn's breakout film, CAPTAIN BLOOD just three years earlier and she radiated beauty as well as goodness! Heck, after seeing her, I fell in love with Ms. DeHavilland the first time I saw this! Along with her, practically all the best supporting actors were provided. For the baddies, we had Claude Rains and Basil Rathbone and as for the heroes, we had Eugene Palette (yeah), Patric Knowles, Ian Hunter and many other fine actors. Plus, for once, Una O'Connor was able to give a subtle and restrained performance--not the shrieking idiot she played in films like BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN and THE INVISIBLE MAN! Oh, and of course, lest I forget, Errol Flynn in the lead--a perfect blending of manliness, sex appeal and athleticism! He was born to play this part and no one comes close to him in his interpretation of the character.So with all these ingredients, excellent writing and direction were combined to create a masterpiece. Fun, exciting and timeless. This is one great film.FYI--Historically speaking, Good King Richard was NOT a nice guy, but in fact one of the cruelest and most horrid kings of England. He hated ruling and got his kicks killing people in battle as well as murdering innocents and plundering their cities. Why he was chosen in ROBIN HOOD and IVANHOE to be a hero makes no sense at all if you know your history.

For me, there are two things that make it such a winner the match-up of Crystal and Hines, which was unfortunately not repeated, and the Chicago scenery. Adding in Darlanne Fluegel was just icing on the cake. And speaking of icing, any Chicagoan will laugh frequently during this film at the pitiful imitation snow, which looks more like frosting than precipitation (especially when you see it laying on top of very green tree leaves).Crystal was hot at the time after his year on SNL, and he manages to work in some of his character shtick here without sidetracking the plot. Hines had recently done White Nights and Cotton Club, so he was also on a roll. The two of them work naturally together in the funny AND serious moments of the film, and the dialog is crisp and clever. There are loads of buddy-cop clichés here, but for some reason they work well. Peter Hyams deserves credit for his snappy direction and good camera work, and for making good use of the locations.Speaking of the locations, let me add my own comments about the Chicago scenery. Gregory Hines' apartment is a building at the SW corner of Franklin St. and Institute Place. Lots of HILL STREET location work was also done on Franklin St because of the L tracks above the pavement. That building is also one block from the Chicago Avenue L station, which is a favorite of filmmakers because of the S curve of the tracks (you can see this station in DOZENS of films and TV shows). I used to work a block from there and everything was very familiar! There are some disconnects in the car chase scene. They leave O'Hare and turn off at River Road, and next thing you know, they're on a surface level CTA track, which I'm guessing is somewhere on the Ravenswood line (but nowhere near the airport). Next thing you know, they're entering the subway, which is quite far from where they started. And in the subway scene you can tell (thanks to DVR) that the tracks are merely painted reflective lines on concrete. (I never spotted that in the theater!) They pass through the Chicago avenue station, and what appears to be the curve by the Merchandise Mart station, and the crash takes place at the LaSalle\/Van Buren station, which is at the south end of the Loop. (I'm 99% sure I could read the sign during that scene, as well as a billboard for the Channel 5 news team.) During the chase on the train tracks, you'll notice how cleverly Hyams intercuts low POV shots (not showing cars) with the shots of the cars themselves. Also, in the final ride to the State of Illinois building they head south on Franklin (follow along on Google maps!) then turn left (east) on Grand at the big Zimmerman liquor store. Next time you see them, they're crossing the river on Michigan avenue coming south by the Wrigley building, a shot obviously inserted for scenic value only. Why? Because any Chicagoan with half a brain would have turned down LaSalle Street and gone straight to the goal, rather than driving all the way to Michigan just to cruise the shops on the Magnificent Mile!

After watching it for the first time not long ago, I sure hope it was the last time as well, and I know many others could say the same about the time they watched it.In this movie, the five-year mission on the U.S.S. Enterprise is now over. The ship has since been redesigned, and now has a new captain, Willard Decker. However, when a strange, destructive cloud is discovered as it travels through space, and is reported to be headed for Earth, Admiral James T. Kirk is sent to reclaim command of the Enterprise. With the other original crew members from the five-year mission (such as Mr. Spock, Lt. Cmdr. Uhura, Lt. Cmdr. Hikaru Sulu, Cmdr. Montgomery Scotty Scott, and Dr. Leonard Bones McCoy), along with new crew members, the U.S.S. Enterprise is now on a mission into space to stop this cloud and save the Earth! Star Trek The Motion Picture is very slow-paced, which isn't always a bad thing. However, in addition to the slowness in this film, not much really happens in it at all. Throughout the film, crew members very rarely ever leave the ship, and even when one or more of them does, they don't go anywhere interesting. To make it worse, this first installment in the Star Trek movie franchise is rather long (over two hours in length), so this dullness goes on for a very long time! While watching the film, I had trouble keeping up with what was happening, but didn't care! Basically, the only positive thing I can say about Star Trek The Motion Picture is that one quote from McCoy (Spock, this 'child' is about to wipe out every living thing on Earth. Now, what do you suggest we do? Spank it?) put a very slight and brief smile on my face, but one mildly amusing quote obviously can't save the film. I get the feeling I'm even being too generous giving this movie a 4\/10! Star Trek was a groundbreaking TV series in the sci-fi genre, and got itself many die-hard fans. Fans had to wait a while for the first movie to finally be made, but when it finally happened, they were in for a huge disappointment! Fortunately, a handful of movies followed Star Trek The Motion Picture in the franchise, and there are definitely much better ones than this! No matter how big a Trekkie you may be, there's likely no guarantee that you will enjoy this movie!

However, I was always aware of how good it looked, its atmosphere and general tone and when I realised it was David Fincher that directed it I thought perhaps that maybe I should give this another try.Mellowed with age (!) I decided to give the film a second chance, and knowing of the controversies with the script and editing etc etc I finally gave it another go, but this time the newer extended version. While still not exactly Fincher's Directors Cut (he wasn't allowed to film things he wanted to do I gather) this is for all intents and purposes his version and the one that should have been released. I watched it on a rainy Saturday afternoon and was frankly stunned. It was absolutely superb, not just standing up to the previous two classics but perhaps even having the edge on them in terms of style and content. Once you grasp the main moral theme of the story it really does grab you. Apart from the fact that it is so terribly and genuinely sad, it offers some interesting metaphysical points (sorry...big word, didn't want to sound that pretentious...really) about the Alien being in a way Death and how mankind can defeat it by accepting it (death that is not the monster). Someone else on IMDb described the film as like a fine wine that matures with age. I agree, and I can't recommend this version enough (simply don't bother with the theatrical release...it's OK don't get me wrong but it's not a classic like this one)especially if like me you're one of these people that was so angered by it after seeing Aliens. Actually when you realise that it was one of the original scripts that killed off Hicks and Newt I can even more forgive Mr Fincher. Also, and I'm sure proper film fans won't be, the effects are stilted at times especially with the alien. This is because the original idea had the alien coming out of an ox and therefore was supposed to be fairly large when in the theatrical release it came out of a dog. Link this with the aliens growth, editing and adding effects later in the day partially explains why the alien doesn't seem quite right at times. Either way - you MUST see this version, easily a nine out of ten to the original releases 5.

Actually when you realise that it was one of the original scripts that killed off Hicks and Newt I can even more forgive Mr Fincher. Also, and I'm sure proper film fans won't be, the effects are stilted at times especially with the alien. This is because the original idea had the alien coming out of an ox and therefore was supposed to be fairly large when in the theatrical release it came out of a dog. Link this with the aliens growth, editing and adding effects later in the day partially explains why the alien doesn't seem quite right at times.

Like many, I was so infuriated by the killing off of Newt and Hicks that I refused really to acknowledge what was happening in this film. However, I was always aware of how good it looked, its atmosphere and general tone and when I realised it was David Fincher that directed it I thought perhaps that maybe I should give this another try.Mellowed with age (!) I decided to give the film a second chance, and knowing of the controversies with the script and editing etc etc I finally gave it another go, but this time the newer extended version. While still not exactly Fincher's Directors Cut (he wasn't allowed to film things he wanted to do I gather) this is for all intents and purposes his version and the one that should have been released. I watched it on a rainy Saturday afternoon and was frankly stunned. It was absolutely superb, not just standing up to the previous two classics but perhaps even having the edge on them in terms of style and content.

For example, when the batteries fall out of the box, we can see the wheels start turning in Karen's head and everything starting to fall into place. It's not a bad little scene, but it could have been better. Apparently, the original script called for a period of time in which the audience would be unsure whether Andy or Chuckie were committing the murders, and the battery scene would have been the first real evidence that Chuckie was actually alive and a killer. That would have been a wiser move and made for a better movie. Another example of *Child's Play* as bad-movie-done-well is the car scene in which Chuckie tries to kill Mike; this thing goes from patently ridiculous (he had a chance to stop the car in the time between getting out of Chuckie's choke-hold and when Chuckie pushes the accelerator) to genuinely scary when Chuckie is scrambling around outside the car while Mike is trapped inside. That's good stuff.But it's just sad that all of the human actors--including Chris Sarandon--get upstaged by a foul-mouthed doll. The sardonic and sharp-tongued best friend Maggie is a tired stereotype (even in 1988). By the time the 9 o'clock news rolls around, I didn't really care if she survived or not, which is not a good thing. And Alex Vincent, the kid who plays Andy, is not good at all. His lines are often delivered with what I can only call bewilderment--as if he has no idea what's going on in the scene or in the story. That's not surprising since he was about six years old at the time, so he can't be faulted for it. The movie, however, can (and should be). In the end, there are a lot of horror movies I'd rather watch than this one, but I'd rather watch this than *Jaws 3-D* or *Hellraiser Bloodlines*.

This movie proves that the most terrifying movie experiences are those that happen not on the screen but in the viewer's imagination.This film builds to a shattering crescendo of tension, with the explanation very logical, depending on one's interpretation. The road from unease through fear through genuine horror has seldom been so ably traveled, and if one's complaints that the picture is raw and technically crude are true, when have we ever had an experience like this one?

These performers go so far beyond acting that it's no wonder many people take this film for an actual documentary.The final scenes in the movie are pure horror, and Miss Donehue's startling and moving direct address to the camera not only shows what terror can do to the human spirit but also points out how shoddy and derivative all the low-budget teenage slasher films that came before really are.The highest compliment I can pay to this wildly successful film is that all those involved in its making deserved their success.

This kind of thing almost killed the Indiana Jones series ya know. Cute kids are for Disney movies, not real movies. Neilsen at least took the movie seriously, even though it seems nobody else did. The plot had Schwarzenegger repeatedly pulling Red Sonja's fat out of the fire and that undercut her character considerably. A warrior woman doesn't need a dude to get her out of a mess, thats her job! To not re-use the Conan character in this movie was a crime. Kalidor? Sheesh. The movie never set the proper mood and its pacing was rather disjointed and sloppy, unlike Conan the Barbarian which had multiple story lines that flowed gracefully. When it comes to fantasy movies, its okay to have cheesy costumes, its okay to have harryhausen style animation, its okay to have silly exorbitant sets that make no sense, but to have a horrible script is unforgivable.This movie could have been a classic, but the script felt like it was written by a 12 year old.

He's not in love with Denise either, sure he likes her, but not as much as is displayed in the movie. In the book, Denise has a minor part. Another minus.Also, the movie represents the killer as some sick psycho. OK, in the book you can't really say he's normal either, but the movie really takes his character over the line.Then, the thing I hated most. The last twenty minutes of the movie quite simply do not exist in the book. It ends with Jeff waking up inside a coffin, praying he will die soon and glad he knows what exactly happened to Diane. So, Denise will never know what happened to him, the murderer does not end up getting killed and Jeff most certainly doesn't survive.
