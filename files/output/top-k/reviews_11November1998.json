Watching 2001 A Space Odyssey is like staring at a breathtaking work of art for hours, and seeing things within it that you've never seen before.  I have seen this film several times, and every time I watch it,I notice something else that I didn't before.  Every Kubrick film seems to have this quality.  Although Kubrick denies the storyline of having any significant message, many things can be derived from it, which although abstract, are classic. For instance, the monolith as the symbol of the place where all life is created, and it being the door between death and rebirth.  Also, notice that the music is chaotic when something is unknown, e.g. the gorillas who are afraid of the strange black stone, and later, the humans on the moon after discovering the monolith.  However, when something is discovered, i.e. the use of tools by prehistoric man, or the beautiful satellite scenes from space, the music tends to be classical and pleasing to the ear.  This film, as unique as it is, might frighten some viewers away, but I urgeeveryone to watch it more than once, and I assure you thatyou won't be disappointed.

Remember Luke's parents killed in the original Star Wars? Well, Verhoeven pays homage to that scene and others, but presents the clichés in such an innovative fashion that I found myself worried about the fates of the four primary characters. The high school antics and all the Neal Patrick Harris appearances are clearly played for laughs.The movie is really about two pairs of lovers (shades of Archie comics), but who really belongs with whom?  This is the subplot between all the war campaigns against the bugs. It seems that Dizzy (my favorite) will win over our hero with her loyalty, spunk and dedication.  Verhoeven, however, is having fun when he lets Rico fall instead for the voluptuous Denise Richards. Yes, size matters! The would-be lovers of Rico and Carmen eventually suffer very violent demises.Woven into the structure of the film are small tributes to such films as An Officer and a Gentleman, Braveheart and Aliens. It's a tour de force film from Verhoeven, with satire, sarcasm, philosophy (i.e., fascism), relentless action and eye-popping CGI mixed together. The incredible FX include the hordes of bugs and the realistic gore, especially the decapitations and severed limbs  (perhaps inspired by Braveheart).All in all, a wonderful treat from Verhoeven.  It can be enjoyed as a serious story or as a profoundly ironic film. In either case, it is a journey not to be missed.  I give it 9 out of 10 stars.

Kevin Spacey gave another monumental performance yet received no Oscar nomination.  I guess having back to back to back great performances will do that to you.  You cannot find a better trio to play these three cops.  White(Crowe) is the veteran cop who loves to use violence to get the job done.  Exley(Pearce) is the straight as an arrow rookie who prefers to use his smarts and mind games in place of violence.  He is kniving and has no reservations to stab you in the back to ahead.  These two characters are perfect because they are complete opposites of each other. Vincennes(Spacey) is a medium of the two.  He used to be like White but is what Exley is striving to become.  His transformation throughout the film to amend his wrong actions give his character in this film the most credibility.  The one thing I did not agree with was Kim Basinger's win of Best Supporting Actress.  She seemed quite dull and did not give half the performance as Crowe or Spacey.  Also, if you watch this movie, watch out for the funniest moment on screen this year dealing with Exley insulting the Lana Turner hooker.
