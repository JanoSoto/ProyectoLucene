It has good actors, good suspense and an interesting premise. I don't have to praise the acting job of Edward Norton on here because it has already been done enough. The other actors including Edward Furlong also do a pretty decent job. But like I said, take it for what it is, A GOOD MOVIE. A good movie can consist of two elements that makes it Good. One of these is good entertainment(which this movie is) and very unrealistic(which this movie is).First let me tell you that racism is a very real problem in this country(USA) and in most places all over the world. Myself being a Black man in America knows all too well the reality of blatant and subtle racism. So I give this MOVIE some credit for touching on the subject. But my biggest complaint about this MOVIE is how unrealistic it truly is.Let me begin. First of all, skinheads in America are not seen as much of a threat in American reality as they are portrayed to be in this film. Tell the avarage American Black, White, Brown, whatever that the Skinheads are on the move and they'll just shrug their shoulders and go about their business. This film tries to portray the Skinheads as much as a threat as say, the Klan in the post civil war South up until the Civil Rights Movement. Now that Klan, in that time period, was indeed a very realistic threat to Blacks and anyone who opposed them. This MOVIE tries to portray the skinheads in this same light(or dark) and it just doesn't work for me.*Possible Spoilers*Second of all. The basketball scene(as said by other commenters) has to be one of the most unrealistic scenes in the history of Hollywood. A bunch of skinheads driving a bunch of supposedly hardcore gangbangers off the court would, NEVER, NEVER, EVER, HAPPEN!!! If you have ever been to L.A. you would know that this is a rediculous scene. I mean a lot of the gang infested areas of L.A. have a lot of police wary to go in them. What do you think gangbangers would do to some skinheads? Especially skinheads who are using the N-Word so fluenty. Exactly. I just was hoping for a Don't try this at home warning to flash across the bottom of the screen.Third thing that bothered me was the depiction of prison. Here we see Derek Vinyard and his skinhead buddies skipping through prison like it was an amusement park. Like they are highly represented diplomats, conducting business and going about their merry little ways. Now most of us know that most major prisons of the country are not like this. Whites in most major prisons have very small numbers. The prison system population is dominated by Blacks and Hispanics(unfortunately). The most believable comment was made by Guy Torrey when he said In here, your the n***a. In the real world, in most prison situations, Derek and his merry men wouldn't stand a chance if the sh*t hit the fan. And Guy Torrey's character putting his life on the line for Derek, I'm just not buying that.The last thing I will elaborate on is the skinhead party scene(just shaking my head). Ok, so we have King Derek(with his god like status) just march into the skinhead leader's office(Cameron), kick the living sh*t out of him, and just waltz out. Ok, he had a gun. But do you mean to tell me that none of the other 150 or so skinheads had guns? If these skinheads were truly the great threat to society this movie wants us to believe they are then Derek would have went home in pieces. This scene just has me at a loss for words(almost as much as the basketball scene). I was thinking to myself, who is this guy, Derek Matrix.I have to disagree with some of the commenters that the last scene with Edward Furlong's character being shot, was over the top, uncalled for, and unrealistic. Yeah all he did was blow smoke in the guys face. But look all over this country today and kids are killing kids in schools all the time for less offenses. Bullying and being a part of a different social group come to mind. So that can and does happen. The proof is in the pudding.But for what it is, a MOVIE, it is very good and entertaining. It did it's job, it kept me watching with anticipation.Like I said earlier in my review, racism is very real, and it needs to be delt with. I give this movie thumbs up for trying to deal with the issue. If they just could have done it in a more realistic way this film could have been more than just a film.

I'd only seen him as a &#145;special guest' once or twice on the animated series of Spider-Man I was watching when I was in my early teens and the only things I remembered, were that he was a vampire hunter and that he seemed to be a native American. In the film version dedicated to Blade, he still hunts vampires, but instead of being a native American he is black. I, for one, do not care, but if there would be a film with a black Spidey, an Asian Wolverine, a blue Hulk or a black Kingpin in a Spider-Man film, I don't think I could bare it. Now I'm not judgmental or something, so I would not dismiss different colored characters immediately, but I guess for some characters it would be harder for me to stomach, because I like them more than others.Getting back to this film, I must say that it starts off great, with an original insight into the lifestyle of modern vampires and some good old action. The film just immediately finds it's pace and luckily it stays on it for the bigger part of the picture. The contributors to the films capability to do that the actors. Wesley Snipes is good as vampire hunting Blade as is Kris Kristofferson as his elderly sidekick Whistler. The best performance though, in my opinion, comes from Stephen Dorff, who not only seems to enjoy playing Deacon Frost but seems to actually become Deacon Frost just for the take of each scene he is in. He doesn't just act Frost, he breathes Frost, he IS Frost!The direction of the film, is OK. Nothing great, nothing bad. The choreography of the action sequences is mostly good and there are just some minor things (which are present in almost every film) that could have been improved in those important departments (important for an action film that is!). The things I do not like about this film, I would like to blame on the script. First of all I feel that Blade's personal drama could have gotten a bit more attention, so that he could have more depth as a character and second of all I didn't quite like the ending of the film. Why? Well, first of all, the ending is somewhat predictable. Secondly, I felt that it could have been more original and spectacular. I mean, throughout the film Frost makes such a big fuss about La Morga, that  in the end I couldn't believe what kind of wuss the prophecy foretold. Last and maybe least, the lines in the end aren't too good. Well maybe that is putting it a bit too harsh, but Blade screaming &#145;Frost' over and over again seemed a little lame and unoriginal to me.7 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 September 2003","score":"","review":"  Before watching this film, I had relatively little knowledge of the comic book character Blade.

I thought it was terrible and I'll tell you why.FIRST - this movie is a sequel to a really good movie.  The problem is that 2010 does not stay in the true spirit of 2001.  Yes, they are both sci-fi, but 2001 dealt with issues like Can science and space exploration solve all answers?, What if we find something we aren't prepared to find? where 2010 was just a lame plot sci-fi flick.  They touched on some of those issues, but it was a plot driven movie not really concerned with answering life's deeper questions.  Unless, of course, watching a ghost turn into a fetus really answered some troubling question for you.SECOND - The plot is just sad.  Get there quickly then realize being there is bad so get back quickly.  The added cold-war element was interesting, I guess.  To be honest, it seemed cheap to me.  I was p***ed to find that it turns out that the monoliths were creating a new sun.  A second sun? That's not even physically possible!!!  Can you even call a movie science-fiction if you throw science out the window?THIRD - I always liked the limited dialog in 2001.  It gave space a cold empty feel, like it probably really has.  Think about all that was said in 2001 with such limited dialog.  Then you got 2010 with lines like How do you say 'dumb' in Russian? or Whether we are based on carbon or silicon makes no fundamental difference. We should each be treated with appropriate respect.FOURTH - How do you do so little with such a stellar cast?FIFTH - I really like some of the camera shots in 2001.  That is usually not something I think about.  Just some of the shots were so visually spectacular.  In 2010 I caught myself thinking on more than once how poorly scenes were shot.  If someone NOT IN THE BUSINESS is seeing lighting problems, then they've got to be BIG problems.I just didn't like this movie.  It irritated me.  It didn't even entertain on some basic level.

Then you got 2010 with lines like How do you say 'dumb' in Russian? or Whether we are based on carbon or silicon makes no fundamental difference. We should each be treated with appropriate respect.FOURTH - How do you do so little with such a stellar cast?FIFTH - I really like some of the camera shots in 2001.  That is usually not something I think about.  Just some of the shots were so visually spectacular.  In 2010 I caught myself thinking on more than once how poorly scenes were shot.  If someone NOT IN THE BUSINESS is seeing lighting problems, then they've got to be BIG problems.I just didn't like this movie.  It irritated me.  It didn't even entertain on some basic level.  It's just a bad movie, but worse, it tries to capitalize on a great movie like 2001.

Laurie is taken to the hospital and Dr. Loomis and the local sheriff continue to hunt Michael. That's the story...it's not much but at least you're in the middle of it. They might as well could have made Halloween a 180 minutes feature of terror but I doubt the original would have ever received the status it enjoys now...SMALL SPOILERS !!!  What every ( slightly clever ) viewer already suspected gets confirmed in Halloween II. Jamie Lee aka Laurie Strode isn't just a random target in the eyes of Michael... She's his sister and was adopted two years after Michael killed his other sister. I don't know, I guess he likes to be the only child ? So, he has decided to get rid of Laurie too and hangs around in Haddonfield till he finds her. In the meantime, he'll spend his time by killing some innocent people who work in the hospital or just happen to walk in his way. END SPOILERS!!!!Of course Halloween II isn't the masterpiece or the milestone the original was. A lot of people ( and I do mean A LOT ) call the original the best horror movie ever made because of his trendsetting and atmosphere. I don't think it's THE best but I still agree it's a great movie. No wonder the sequel can't live up to that. The surprise element is gone, the atmosphere is a bit ruined and Michael doesn't look that scary anymore. There is less use of the chilling music ( by Carpenter himself) which increases the bore-aspect as well.  Although the original only had 4 or 5 killings ( while Halloween II has 11 or 12), this episode is a lot less creepy. Donald Pleasence still is great, of course, and Jamie Lee can still scream as loud as before.It certainly isn't a must see, but if you do see it, you won't regret it. It's a nice way to kill 90 minutes.After this one, they tried something completely different with the Halloween concept. Halloween III Season of the Witch became one of the biggest failures in horror history. A bit undeserved, I think. It wasn't THAT bad, it just didn't have Michael.

I suppose in an age where everything on amazon gets at least four stars, good subjective criticism is proving harder and harder to find...but really...is this film better than Chinatown? Better than Casablanca? The Third Man? Mean Streets? Withnail and I? Better than Adam's Rib, Singin' in the Rain, Rear Window, Day for Night, Bande a Part, Taxi Driver, West Side Story, Les Quatre Cent Coups, Some Like it Hot, Seven Samurai?I've seen this film twice, once at the cinema and once on TV as I lie stuffed with Xmas dinner. The first time was mildly enjoyable, the second pretty turgid. Despite the presence of the ever excellent Robbins (though Morgan Freeman phones in the same performance he's given in every film ever since), this film never transcends the humble source of its story - a Stephen King short - and whilst it's a 'nice' tale with a reasonable twist at the end, can anyone else explain to me why such praise has been heaped on this utterly average experience?And it's not just IMDB. A recent UK Channel Four poll found Shawshank right up there. Perhaps it's the combination of pseudo-harsh prison story and a buddy tale along with the lashings of on the nose humanism that appeals across genders and other boundaries. I don't know.

He is a true crusader whose motives are almost certainly altruistic.  He is great in this part.  The script and the production are very good too, unfortunately this movie was not widely released.  John Travolta plays a classy Beacon Hill lawyer in Boston.  His firm comes across a case where a factory appears to be poisoning the local water supply, and in general hurting the environment and certain people are covering it up.Robert Duvall plays the lawyer for the said factory.  The movie is very much a battle of wills as John Travolta matches up with his nemesis who understands Travolta, and even sympathizes with the young idealistic crusader a little bit.  The two are very different.  Travolta is a young upstart still learning how to be a lawyer, while Duvall is a seasoned lawyer who has years of experience behind him.  What is fascinating is watching Travolta's character go from a very ritzy person who seems oblivious to the working class to a crusader that (SPOILER) fights for those that have suffered almost obsessively.  I also liked to see John Travolta taking on the establishment.  He took on a number of high powered lawyers, business leaders and people that in general viewed him in a very negative light.  He took them all on.  He lost, but that was not his point.  It is amazing that the man went bankrupt, and convinced his two partners to almost go bankrupt as well taking on thisThe supporting cast is excellent.  Tony Shalhoub and William H. Macy play his put upon partners, John Lithgow is a judge who comes to conflict many times with Travolta.  The ending was great.  SPOILER  It was not a good ending necessarily, but it was appropriate, the good guys in the movie did not win, but some kind of good guys did win, we think anyways.  I really enjoyed this movie.  Travolta does an excellent job, he is a great lead here.  The script has few flaws and the overall film leaves little to be desired.  This is a fine film, I recommend it highly.

Three Days of the Condor wasn't a major blockbuster in 1975 and didn't win any Academy Awards the next spring, But if it were remade today it would hold up as good as any film about government secret covert policies and behind the scenes action as any movie about the same subject would now. The movie Three Days of the Condor eerily as well as accurately predicts the very situation that the US has got itself into now,in 2003,in the oil-rich Middle and Near East some twenty eight years ago back in in 1975! Robert Redford, Joe Turner, works for the CIA and is doing his job like he's done it for years. He reads and interprets books, without the slightest suspicion of how he, as well as his co-workers, is looked upon when it comes to the real scheme of things to what his bosses think about what's going on in the world.Turner takes his employment in the CIA, which is one that he obviously needed to get a very high government clearance, like most working people would;a 9 to 5 job with a months vacation and a good government pension waiting for him when he retires. One day when it, unknowing at the time to Turner, luckily comes his turn get lunch for his co-workers that he finds out that working for an outfit like the CIA is a lot more dangerous then him getting mugged or having his motor bike stolen on his way to work. From then on until the end of the movie and even beyond Turner is a marked man, not marked by the enemies of the US but by his CIA bosses themselves.Three Days of the Condor is a true Man without a Country movie when Turner as well as those that he worked with, who were loyal to their country and the agency that employed them, were deemed expendable because of a slight case of paranoia from a top administrator in the agency. The CIA outfit that Turner was in were checking out a book, that seemed to be some kind of secret blueprint, written in a number of unlikely and foreign languages about a Western-type country plotting to, and taking over, an or a number of oil-rich Middle-East nations! This is exactly what's happening in Iraq today! I doubt that A movie like Three Days of the Condor would be made today given the climate of the September 11, 2001 attacks and the War on Terrorism in both Afghanistan & Iraq that quickly followed. But back in 1975 when we here in the USA were living in a more peaceful and secure time and with the Frank Church Commission investigating in public the accesses of the US intelligence agencies it could.I especially liked the cast of Cliff Robertson, Higgens, Max Von Saydo, Jobert, and Faye Dunaway, Kathy, besides of course Robert Redford's Joe Turner. I liked the contrast between Higgens and Jobert in the fact that Higgens was a career man working for the government and Jobert was a contract killer only working for whoever paid him. Even though Jobert should have been the heavy in the film he was by far more sympathetic because what he did was only a job, and that all it was, to him and his encounter with Turner towards the end of the movie, who's job it was for him to kill, wasn't that threatening and not at all as personal as Turners scenes with Higgens were. Higgens always came across as a con-man who would shoot you, or have someone shoot you, in the back as soon as you turned around. This contrast goes to show you that a person who hires a killer to kill someone is far more guilty then the one that does the killing himself. Charles Manson didn't kill anyone, he had others do the killing for him, but he's more responsible for those murders back in 1969 then the ones that did the killings themselves.Faye Dunaway as Kathy was great as the innocent bystander who's life was turned upside down, by all these events that she had no knowledge or control of. She showed fear and outrage at first and then later realizing that Turner was telling the truth and that she ,like him, had no choice in the matter because she knew too much but to risk her life, what else could she do.

In fact I think that Three Days of the Condor was the first major motion picture that was filmed there. The WTC was opened to the public in 1974 and the movie was made in late 1974 and early 1975. Even more ironic about the film is that Higgens, who was undoubtedly the villain in it, had his CIA offices located in of all places, you guessed it, the World Trade Center.

Carrie, however, is not like regular teenagers as she has been blessed(?) with telekinetic powers and as the inner rage grows within Carrie so, it seems, do these potentially lethal abilities. Brian De Palma directed this amazingly stylish adaptation of Stephen King's first novel which is arguably the best Stephen King adaptation ever to be made. Sissy Spacek's performance is one of the greatest to ever grace a horror film. Somehow managing to perfectly embody the typical school life of the usual high school outcasts, Spacek was able to bring to everyone the appalling life that so many teenagers are forced to tolerate. From the opening scenes where Carrie is utterly humiliated at the hands of her classmates after Carrie's hysterical reaction to her first menstruation, to the painfully wretched ending it becomes nigh on impossible not to sympathise with Spacek's character. Spacek was quite rightly Oscar-nominated for this performance. Spacek's performance was enhanced by fellow Oscar-nominee Piper Laurie in the role of the religious-nut Margaret White. In some ways the naivety shown towards Carrie and what is happening to her is amusing but at the same time it is terrifying to think that any mother could allow her daughter to go though such a generally horrendous life. Piper Laurie was able to make this all too abhorrent character her own with a thoroughly convincing and unsettling performance. De Palma cleverly directs this movie. Instead of immediately introducing us to Carrie's powers he focuses on the torment (and the tormentors) of Carrie first. This allows the viewer to feel for Carrie and will her towards revenge while ensuring that she is not made into a one-dimensional killer. The movie is very well paced and is presented in a brutally clear fashion. De Palma refrains from using any visual effects with the exception of the infamous `Prom Night' scene which was incredibly well crafted and immersed the viewer in this horrifying display of rage. The final twenty minutes of Carrie are some of the most intense and gripping moments to have been portrayed in horror cinema. These scenes without a doubt helped to build one of the most artistic and and incredible climaxes in all of film.&#145;Carrie' is not for those who just want to see people sliced up or prefer fast-paced horror as it is presented as a heart-breaking drama with a horrifying twist. The magnificent cast (which features John Travolta in an early role) was also graced with fantastic performances from Betty Buckley as the kindly gym teacher and Nancy Allen as Chris, the deplorable ring leader of this atrocious bullying. In my opinion &#145;Carrie' is unquestionably worth a look for horror fans. 'Carrie' is very well directed, with a superb screenplay from Larry Cohen and featuring two of the greatest performances in horror. My rating for &#145;Carrie' &#150; 9\/10.

Spacek was quite rightly Oscar-nominated for this performance. Spacek's performance was enhanced by fellow Oscar-nominee Piper Laurie in the role of the religious-nut Margaret White. In some ways the naivety shown towards Carrie and what is happening to her is amusing but at the same time it is terrifying to think that any mother could allow her daughter to go though such a generally horrendous life. Piper Laurie was able to make this all too abhorrent character her own with a thoroughly convincing and unsettling performance. De Palma cleverly directs this movie. Instead of immediately introducing us to Carrie's powers he focuses on the torment (and the tormentors) of Carrie first. This allows the viewer to feel for Carrie and will her towards revenge while ensuring that she is not made into a one-dimensional killer. The movie is very well paced and is presented in a brutally clear fashion. De Palma refrains from using any visual effects with the exception of the infamous `Prom Night' scene which was incredibly well crafted and immersed the viewer in this horrifying display of rage. The final twenty minutes of Carrie are some of the most intense and gripping moments to have been portrayed in horror cinema. These scenes without a doubt helped to build one of the most artistic and and incredible climaxes in all of film.&#145;Carrie' is not for those who just want to see people sliced up or prefer fast-paced horror as it is presented as a heart-breaking drama with a horrifying twist. The magnificent cast (which features John Travolta in an early role) was also graced with fantastic performances from Betty Buckley as the kindly gym teacher and Nancy Allen as Chris, the deplorable ring leader of this atrocious bullying. In my opinion &#145;Carrie' is unquestionably worth a look for horror fans. 'Carrie' is very well directed, with a superb screenplay from Larry Cohen and featuring two of the greatest performances in horror. My rating for &#145;Carrie' &#150; 9\/10.

Carrie, however, is not like regular teenagers as she has been blessed(?) with telekinetic powers and as the inner rage grows within Carrie so, it seems, do these potentially lethal abilities. Brian De Palma directed this amazingly stylish adaptation of Stephen King's first novel which is arguably the best Stephen King adaptation ever to be made. Sissy Spacek's performance is one of the greatest to ever grace a horror film.

Heather Langenkamp and John Saxon continue their father\/daughter roles very respectably. John Saxon is the man is what I'm trying to say. Nightmare 3 also has a couple of future stars. Patricia Arquette and Laurence Fishburne have both made good names for themselves. Some other people made good from this as well. Wes Craven had a little help on the screenplay from Chuck Russell and Frank Darabont. You might recognize that last name from such films as The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile.

Perhaps because of how much I enjoyed the book, I absolutely hated the movie.  Yes, I mean hated.  Abhorred. Despised.First off, the acting was...oooh how do I put this?  CRAP!  And that's putting it mildly.  Victoria Tennant (Mother) was just purely awful.  Not a single line portrayed any realism whatsoever.  Louise Fletcher (as Grandmother) is normally quite menacing in her roles, but this time, she was absolutely laughable.  Perhaps she simply didn't have much to work with. Kristy Swanson (Kathy)...how on EARTH did they choose her?  Every single line was over the top, overly dramatic, and just so plain ridiculously delivered it made me wonder if I was watching an Ed Wood film.  Umm, yeah, it was that bad.  Jeb Stuart Adams (Chris) was, well, ok I suppose.  He wasn't *as* bad as the others, but still had his moments of Can someone please buy me some acting lessons?    Thankfully, the children playing the twins had few lines as they were already difficult to deal with WITHOUT words.The screenplay was just downright awful.  Now I understand that books cannot always be *perfectly* translated into a movie, but c'mon...FAR TOO MANY changes took place that completely took away from the story itself. Well, at least for those of us that read the book.  The dialogue was excrement, to state it lightly.About the only thing this movie had going for it was the setting.  The huge mansion and grounds would have been fantastic for the movie had not the rest of it been so darn awful.  It's a shame, this really could have been a great one.  Unfortunately, it was nothing but a major dud that left little to enjoy.Flowers in the Attic (the movie) earns 2 out of 10 stars (and that's for the ability to pick a great setting).The book, however, earns 10 out of 10 stars and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who loves reading.
