Instead, it turns out it was wise to skip this for almost a decade.A troop that has just landed at Normandy is diverted to move 100m into France and find a single private whose value has just gone up. And sure... they walk the whole way (never even hitching a ride) They encounter provisioned troops every fifteen minutes along the way (any of which would have been more efficiently tasked with the mission.) and they find Ryan not alone & lost behind enemy-lines (maintaining radio silence, or in imminent danger); but amidst another platoon (also provisioned) and ready to take on a mission against 4 German tanks and about 80 Germans. Really... what a bunch of schlock!Why do people make up stories to tell about WW2 to show their respect for those who fought it? Make up characters? Invent a phony mission that never occurred? What? ...the hundreds of thousands of personal stories that exist didn't have enough dramatic range? This is a brazen slap in the face to all who fought. S.P.R. is just so much retrograde 1950's storytelling, and Spielberg doesn't have it in him to recognize cinematic cheese when he smells it. There's so much time for soldiers pouring out their hearts & having profound discussions that it's a wonder they even had time for a war. Spielberg is only a shade subtler than flashing subtitles every now and then that say, CRY NOW! and WAVE THE FLAG! I'm as susceptible as anyone to patriotism, but come on. The 3 stars I gave it are for the battle sequences. Every time the action slows & Spielberg needs to come up with something dramatic he delivers a pile of corn... and earns a barrel of lemons.

They find private Ryan almost effortlessly.And what's with the all-star cast, Hanks, Giamatti, Diesel, Damon, Danson, Hines, Ribisi...

It is amazing how foresighted and smart Anthony Burgess was in making such a book. Then, who decides to make it a movie? Stanley Kubrick. I had seen some of his other films, and I was eager to see A Clockwork Orange.The film is a very good film, most especially thanks to the talented Malcolm MacDowell, the directing skills of Kubrick, and the story itself.Malcolm gives such an amazing act as the villainous youth Alex de Large, who is a youth in a futuristic England, where hoods and teens rule the night streets with a savage immorality. Rape, violence, and rebellion are the order of the day, and Alex loves it. Then he is apprehended by the police, and his journey leads him to a dreadful new experiment. I would have to say that I could not imagine anyone apart from Ewan Macgregor (TRAINSPOTTING) that could even match to the stunning, Oscar-worthy performance of MacDowell.Kubrick is a very good director, who ranks alongside Oliver Stone and Martin Scorsese as my three favourite directors. His films inspire thought, interest, and entertainment. His methods of direction truly pay off in this adaptation to A Clockwork Orange. It's a pity that he was soon to be despised as a reclusive pervert from this film. He did an amazing job, and I admire him for it.Finally, the last but not least credit must go to the cleverness of the original creator of A Clockwork Orange. Burgess' novel is wonderful, and for the most part, the movie takes the ideas of the novel correctly. One error would have to be the cutting of Burgess' original novel, but that is not Kubrick's fault, as the American version of the novel is made that way. It would have been nice to see the original ending in the novel, but this is a minor complaint.This movie really appeals to youth, and it is a great movie to see. If I had to pick the best films of Kubrick's career, I would hail Eyes Wide Shut, Barry Lyndon, and A Clockwork Orange as the best films he ever made. Thank you Kubrick, thank you MacDowell, and thank you Burgess, for the genius that is A Clockwork Orange.

With the voice-overs you would have thought of Deckard as a detective, who has to look for clues and hunt down the replicants, but without them Deckard is just a man doing his job. Furthermore, in the director's cut there are a number of long scenes, which have no dialogue and that leaves us time to soak in the atmosphere and hope that the future will not be like this.

The plot is highly sophisticated; it centers around the life of George Bailey, a successful business man that is thrown out of control when financial aspects hinder the progress of his Building and Loan enterprise. The business crisis is the focus of the story, but the majority of it is a laid-back reflection of the good parts of Bailey's life. In the end, Bailey is brought to redemption and sees the world in a new light, ultimately leading to one of the most uplifting endings in any movie.The cast was perfect all around; there was not a single actor that jumped out as a poor choice. James Stewart shines with the critical role of Bailey. He starts off as a confident and envisioned man, but is eventually consumed by business problems and sees no way out. He completely misses the positive impact that he has made on the community, but reaches a sort of understanding by the end. Stewart is excellent at conveying this development of ideas. Even Mr. Potter, the antagonist of the film, becomes a sympathetic character. Even though he initially comes off as a selfish pest, it is hard not to respect his business achievements and feel sorry that he does not enjoy other company.The plot is put together so well that it is impossible not to be drawn in, even for modern audiences. The idea of guardian angels watching over us might seem ridiculous, but ends up being an intriguing plot element. The mix of fantasy with reality works out. The camera work, dialog, and way the scenes were set up are surprisingly modern. It does not require the audience to watch the movie from the lens of someone from the 1940's, but rather is a timeless experience that can be enjoyed by families of any generation.Simply put, I recommend this movie to all people, especially as a family.

This film brought him fame and was nominated for 3 academy awards. Before becoming a director John Huston was a screenwriter. Film historians categorize Huston's Maltese Falcon as the first film in the dark film noir genre.The protagonist of this movie is Sam Spade, played by Humphrey Bogart. Bogart portrays Spade as a tough, cold-hearted loner that lacks any compassion for others and is an emotionless bastard that only cares for himself. His cold-heartedness can be seen in the movie in his relationship to Brigid O'Shaughnessy, played by Mary Astor, whom later Spade turns into the police. Here he says probably the coldest line in the entire movie, I hope they don't hang you, precious, by that sweet neck. . . . The chances are you'll get off with life. That means if you're a good girl, you'll be out in 20 years. I'll be waiting for you. If they hang you, I'll always remember you. The movie starts in San Francisco, where a woman named Miss Ruth Wonderly, which later on in the movie you find that her real name is Brigid O'Shaughnessy, comes to the office of private eye detectives Spade and Archer. She tells them a made up story about being threatened by a man named Thursby, and Spade and Archer agree to help her. But what was supposed to be a simple task turned deadly. As Archer follows Thursby, Archer is murdered. The police later discover that Thursby was also killed, and Spade becomes the primary suspect in both murders. Later in the story, it turns out that Miss Wonderly had lied to Spade and Archer. She admits to Spade that she was actually looking for a small jeweled falcon statue, the Maltese Falcon, which is worth millions of dollars. Miss Wonderly is associated with several other dubious characters that are also trying to find the statue and will do anything to get their hands on it. One of these people is Joel Cairo. Cairo tries to hire Spade to find the black statue, but then uses a gun to forcefully search Spade's office thinking that the statue might be there. Spade later finds out that Cairo is connected to a man named Wilmer and his boss Kasper Gutman (the fat man).What makes the black bird so valuable is the history behind it. It was a gift from a group of crusaders to the king of Spain in 1539 for helping them get the island called Malta. The falcon disappeared when on a ship to Spain it was robbed by pirates, and its whereabouts remained a mystery until recently.Later on in the movie, a man from a ship that had just arrived from Asia arrives at Spade's office wounded by a gun shot and dies after delivering the falcon to Spade. He had been shot by Wilmer. Spade finally finds a way to work out a deal with Gutman, Wilmer, Cairo and Miss Wonderly when they meet in his apartment. He will hand over the bird to them if they agree to give him a portion of the money. Before handing over the bird to the group, Spade tells them that someone will have to take the blame for the murders of Archer and Thursby. They decided it will be Wilmer. He then hands over the falcon to Gutman and phones the police. However, while waiting for the police they find out that the bird is a fake. In the confusion, Wilmer mysteriously disappears (but is caught later by the police). Gutman says that he will not give up in his quest for the Maltese Falcon, and he and Cairo leave angrily before the police shows up at Spade's apartment. Moments before the cops show up, Spade interrogates Brigid (Miss Wonderly) and finds out that she was in fact the one who shot his partner because she wanted Archer to kill her partner, Thursby, so that she could have the bird to herself. When Archer refused she used Thursby's gun to kill Archer and tried to frame Thursby for the murder. But Wilmer had already killed Thursby by orders of the fat man because he considered him a threat. Spade has a tough time debating whether to turn Brigid over to the police or not. He knows that he loves her but he also knows that she is a compulsive liar and that he cannot trust her. She could betray him anytime and he cannot take that risk. He chooses to turn her into the police and justifies his decision by saying that when one's partner is killed, you just don't stand around and do nothing, you do something about it. He goes on to say it is bad business to allow a partner in a detective firm to get killed without responding. Sam Spade might not be your ideal movie protagonist because of his lack of compassion and emotions. His cold heartedness almost makes him look just as bad as the real bad guys. But in the end he shows that he still has some values and that he can do the right thing. One wonders, however, what Spade would have done if the bird had turned out to be genuine. Would he have taken his cut and stayed silent, or would he still have turned Brigid into the police after he found that she killed his partner?

While this film was not the critical and artistic success of his first directorial effort HONEY I SHRUNK THE KIDS, I think it still rates as one of the top ten Disney live action films of the last 20 years. It didn't quite bomb at the box office when it was released, but it was unfortunate enough to come out on the same weekend as TERMINATOR 2. T2 was such a juggernaut, it was bound to eat up everything in its path. After such huge successes with the STAR WARS films and first two RAIDERS films as one of a group of talented whiz kids who helped give these films their visual style, some might have thought he moved up to the director's chair too soon, even though HONEY was big enough of a hit to spawn two sequels and the ending to ROCKETEER is tantalizing enough to suggest a sequel also. For whatever reasons Disney shelved any such plans. Johnston moved on to make JUMANJI, JURASSIC PARK 3, and HIDALGO, and it's certain he'll continue to make good films.His films are always entertaining and he knows how to fill the screen with memorable images. THE ROCKETEER is no exception. While not in the same class as his later films mentioned above, it does a fine job of bringing to life the old Saturday morning serials, with dashing heroes rescuing damsels in distress and saving the world from dastardly villains. The flying scenes are first rate, including those with the rocket. Interestingly, the special effects were old school, using models and miniatures, without the computer-generated graphics that its box office rival TERMINATOR 2 used extensively and are now the norm in special effects. Old as it is, this film can still give audiences a good ride. I had the pleasure of watching it last night at Lidgerwood Presbyterian Church, with an audience mostly older than me. We all remembered the Republic serials that inspired ROCKETEER's filmmakers and the Errol Flynn-type swashbucklers that make a brief appearance in the storyline. Some in the audience were old enough to have battled Nazis themselves, as do Cliff, the FBI agents and the patriotic gangsters in the end. In these days after September 11th, when we're still, like the Rocketeer, caught up with fighting people whose values and ambitions for world dominance clash with ours, it was enjoyable to see everyone unite to fight a common enemy.

While not in the same class as his later films mentioned above, it does a fine job of bringing to life the old Saturday morning serials, with dashing heroes rescuing damsels in distress and saving the world from dastardly villains. The flying scenes are first rate, including those with the rocket. Interestingly, the special effects were old school, using models and miniatures, without the computer-generated graphics that its box office rival TERMINATOR 2 used extensively and are now the norm in special effects. Old as it is, this film can still give audiences a good ride. I had the pleasure of watching it last night at Lidgerwood Presbyterian Church, with an audience mostly older than me. We all remembered the Republic serials that inspired ROCKETEER's filmmakers and the Errol Flynn-type swashbucklers that make a brief appearance in the storyline. Some in the audience were old enough to have battled Nazis themselves, as do Cliff, the FBI agents and the patriotic gangsters in the end. In these days after September 11th, when we're still, like the Rocketeer, caught up with fighting people whose values and ambitions for world dominance clash with ours, it was enjoyable to see everyone unite to fight a common enemy. It's sad to think that those battles are still being waged long since those nostalgic Saturday mornings.

Director Robert Rodriguez made this for around $7000, and its easily five times more enjoyable than either of its big budget follow-ups Desperado and Once Upon a Time In Mexico. His frantic direction style (along with some amazingly advanced editing for such a shoestring picture) ensures a lightning fast pace, and the incredibly brief running time of eighty minutes ensures this never becomes remotely dull for one second. In my mind, its far more fun to watch than any of the Die Hard or Lethal Weapon films.There are some flaws in the film, but most of them are derived from the low production values, so they're very easy to forgive. The performances aren't of great depth and complexity, but work very well with the film. As the title mariachi, Carlos Gallardo makes for a very likable and affable hero. Its interesting to notice that in the first film, the mariachi wasn't as much of a pretty boy bad ass as he would subsequently become. Consuelo Gómez is very sexy and Peter Marquardt makes for an appropriately hissable villain. The only major problem I had with the film was the downbeat ending, which seems very out of place with what had up to that point been a fun and light hearted shoot-em-up picture. Still, until that, El Mariachi is wonderfully entertaining and very inspiring to potential filmmakers.

The answer, for me anyway, is yes.Citizen Kane is still easily THE greatest films ever made. Its not 'one of', or 'the second', its the FINEST. I don't think any film will ever over-shadow it, either. Its one of the most famous, as it (successfully) broke every cinematic boundary in the book. It introduced countless innovations that are today a common part of film-making.The movie opens with an unforgettable image of a distant, fog-shrouded castle on a hill. It's a classic Gothic shot, and goes a long way towards establishing Citizen Kane's mood. We quickly learn that this place, called Xanadu, is the dwelling of America's Kubla Khan, Charles Foster Kane (Welles), a one-time newspaper magnate who could have become President if not for an ill-advised extramarital affair. Xanadu, in the words of the faux newsreel that gives a brief history of Kane's life, is the costliest monument of a man to himself. Any resemblance to The Ranch, William Randolph Hearst's real-life San Simeon abode, is not coincidental.In the opening, Kane is dead, and utters the word 'rosebud' as he hunches over. His death, like his life, is a big news event, and the paper he owned, the New York Inquirer, is desperate to unearth the meaning of his cryptic last word. Is it a woman he bedded? A horse he bet on? A beloved pet? Some long-lost, unrequited love? The truth, which isn't revealed until the closing scene, represents one of the all-time greatest motion picture ironies, and leads us to believe that, on some level, Kane regretted not having led a simple, quiet life. A ten minuet newsreel follows this to exhibit his larger-than-life accomplishments.After this, reporters and the public in general, begin to investigate what he actually meant by 'rosebud'. The film dips into flashbacks (in chronology), to search for 'rosebud's significance. It also shows interviews with his loved (and loathed) ones, to see if they have any inkling to what it may mean.The movie is a visual masterpiece, a kaleidoscope of daring angles and breathtaking images that had never been attempted before, and has never been equaled since.

In any case, this is a solidly-crafted, fast-paced and witty spoof of the old Universal monster mashes with Count Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, The Wolf Man, The Mummy and The Gill Man all taking part. Duncan Regehr scores best as a nasty Dracula, but Jack Gwillim is a welcome presence in the prologue and finale as his eternal nemesis Abraham Van Helsing. Though essentially a kiddie film with a group of hardened horror addicts\/misfits as its main protagonists, it doesn't shy away from gruesome and dangerous situations &#150; the partner to the cop (father to the leader of the Squad) is blown up by Dracula; the Werewolf is himself made to explode in mid-air (a short-term demise, since he recomposes himself only to be shot down by the proverbial silver bullet); Dracula kidnaps and vampirizes three female students, etc. Predictably, the Frankenstein Monster is shown to be of a benign nature after all &#150; he eventually befriends the kids and almost dispatches Dracula himself! Amusingly enough, it was also quite refreshing to hear the boys swearing profusely and saying the word virgin a lot &#150; without actually knowing what it means! Though I feel that GREMLINS (1984) is still the touchstone for this sort of kiddie horror comedy, THE MONSTER SQUAD lags not too far behind it was actually nice to learn that this was no childhood fluke, and that the film still holds up well after all these years.
