What Tingle doesn't realize is that her other student Luke was the one who made the copy of the answers and stuck it in there. So Leigh Ann, Luke, and Leigh Ann's best friend Jo Lynn go to Tingle's house to try to talk her into believing that it was not Leigh Ann that was cheating.Tingle thinks it will be scandalous and after a mishap involving an arrow almost killing Tingle, she is tied up and held hostage by the three teens for several days while they try to cover up their tracks and make sure that nobody finds out. Pretty much the next hour or so of the movie is in Tingle's house. She gets Jo Lynn and Leigh Ann to turn on each other by telling them fabricated stories from her past that revolve around both girls' attractions toward Luke.The ending was kind of corny, but most movie endings are anyway so I guess the writer(s) has my forgiveness for that.All in all, it was a pretty good watch. If you have a good hour and a half to kill, I would recommend this movie. It's not a bad movie, and even if you don't like the genre it does what a lot of movies can't do - entertain.

Now I don't really like all of his work but this is one of his best. This movie might not have that absurd and yet snappy dialogue and the level of humor compared Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. But the dialogue is still pretty cool and the other areas just got enhanced. Especially how it's more coherent and comes together in a more nicely wrapped package despite multiple different storyline of different characters. But it comes together much better in the end as a whole. This is one of those movie the more times you watch it the more you will appreciate this film. The way the characters act amongst each other is very entertaining to watch and what adds to the humor is the incompetence of some of the characters. In some movies it might get real annoying real easily, but in this it works. Jason Statham was a jewel hustler in real life before he became an actor and he portrayed a street hustler in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Anyways he was really good as one of the protagonist and fit the role really well as the narrator with his charismatic voice. Vinnie Jones is also back again in this, he plays the intimidating and yet engaging character really well. This time around he is more mean and merciless when he has to get his job done. Brad Pitt is in this and he plays a memorable and iconic character and is one of the character that Pitt would be well known for playing next to Tyler Durden. He is simply a scene stealer in this and not in a negative way either. There isn't really a distinct main character in this movie but instead has multiple characters that are interesting and actually fleshed out for the most part which is a hard task to do. Despite there being a lot of characters in this movie it all fits together quite well, just about every character has it's moment. Overall this is a great movie that is most definitely worth seeing.

While the boiling cauldron of plastic appears to be massive enough to supply the skin for hundreds of Good Guys, and Chucky's vital fluid taints the entire batch, somehow this only results in a single doll being occupied by his soul, which seems like a real missed opportunity. An army of Chuckys would have been a bit silly, sure, but that result would definitely have a lot more potential than the dreck we end up sifting through here.Actually, the prologue has some promise, and the prolonged stalking murder of a Play Pal executive recalls Chucky's suspenseful buildups and playful sadism from the first film. As the introduction rolls on, we get the sense that we're in store for a darker and more purely horror-based film than Child's Play 2, which is a refreshing notion. Unfortunately, this impression is negated when the affair proceeds to phase two.The second concept is by far the dumbest of the lot, and sadly takes up the bulk of the film. The Andy character from the first two installments is reintroduced, but now he's a teenager enrolled in a military academy. Chucky locates him and is able to continue pursuing his nemesis at Andy's new stomping grounds by mailing himself to the military installation (have fun trying to figure out how Chucky is able to wrap the Good Guy box in brown paper, tape it up, get himself to a post office, and pay for the shipping... all while he's physically sealed inside the package). The parcel is intercepted by an annoying kid named Tyler (who is juvenile enough to initially believe there isn't anything strange about a doll that talks to him and moves around on its own, but is also somehow considered mature enough to participate in military training exercises), and when our impish killer realizes that he has a new candidate for his ever-elusive body transfer, Tyler becomes Chucky's target for a game of hide the soul. The locale makes way for the film to pack in a score of boot camp movie clichés, including a verbally abusive commander, hazing of the hapless cadet who can't get his act together, and, most brazenly, a reprise of the this is my rifle, this is my gun... mantra from Full Metal Jacket. Despite this being a military installation, Chucky is somehow able to wander around at will undetected (guard duty apparently isn't part of the rigorous program), and at one point he even sneaks into the armory before a combat training exercise and switches out an entire squad's paint-ball rounds with live ammunition, a gag that goes unnoticed by these astute soldiers-to-be until after they've already fired off dozens of shots and killed one of their commanding officers.Things get dumber and dumber as the plot moves forward, and Chucky eventually wraps an ammo belt around his torso like Rambo for no apparent reason and secures a convenient doll-sized pistol to engage in a gun battle with our protagonists. Chucky also orchestrates a hostage situation, which concludes with him throwing a readily available hand grenade at the responding soldiers (because hand grenades are apparently routinely issued to cadets when they go out into the forest to shoot paint-balls at each other).The climax marks the third section of the film, in which Chucky absconds with Tyler and lures his pursuers to a carnival. This segment is by far the most effective, largely because the final showdown takes place inside an elaborate horror-themed roller coaster ride, which is way cooler than anything else in the movie. Andy and Chucky do battle with Tyler's potentially possessed body hanging in the balance, and while Chucky's eventual demise is gruesome and satisfying, the Tyler character is so off-puttingly idiotic that we end up rooting for him to die instead.Though this entry boasts quite a bit more gore than the previous outing, the extra red sauce isn't enough to transcend the limitations of the brain-dead story and largely rote kill scenes. The Chucky effects are predictably solid, and he has a few good one-liners, but the Freddy Krueger-esque zingers that accompany each murder get old fast.The series would of course go in a much different direction after this misguided dud, which is a very savvy move because I don't think I'd be on board for any more installments if they adhered to this tired formula.

Especially those with positive reviews and mixed reviews and this movie is one of them. Now, before I begin this review, I would like to say that I never saw the original Mighty Joe Young this remake was based on because I guess there weren't any 1940s movies for me to watch, but looking back at this as a child when it was first released at the late 90s, I simply loved it as much as anyone else. Sure, it's not a masterpiece due to it's formulaic storyline and cartoony characters, but I think it's an underrated childhood favorite of mine and I still love it ever since.The story, although formulaic, is actually faithful to the original storyline of the original Mighty Joe Young, but made some changes to the present time while being helped by the extraordinary special effects. The characters, on the whole, are a mixed bag. Charlize Theron did great as Jill Young and Bill Paxton did a good job as Professor Gregg O' Hara (I also liked the relationship between them), but the rest of the actors ranged from decent to so-so. There were some hilarious moments (despite it's dark and intense beginning) and some tear-jerking moments especially the ending scene where Joe, the gorilla, dies and comes back alive after saving a kid from a burning ferris wheel. It also has a lovely music score from James Horner and it's his best solid music score as a composer.The film did become a box office bomb when it first came out in 1998, but that doesn't mean it could not be recommended to others because this is an underrated tear-jerking movie that I loved as a kid and I still love it as a young adult now. My advice If you're looking for a movie that could leave you teary eyed, check this one out.

Now, before I begin this review, I would like to say that I never saw the original Mighty Joe Young this remake was based on because I guess there weren't any 1940s movies for me to watch, but looking back at this as a child when it was first released at the late 90s, I simply loved it as much as anyone else.

So, I decided to watch a few more Stanley Kubrick movies. STORY Taking place in the Cold War, a paranoid general, Jack Ripper (Sterling Hayden) is about to start a nuclear holocaust in the U.S.S.R. However, Ripper's executive officer and group captain Lionel Mandrake, (Peter Sellers) thought that his plan is just a drill, but to Ripper it's not.Meanwhile, in the war room at the Pentagon, U.S. President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers, again) calls upon the premier of the Soviet Union, Dimitri to tell him about this horrible news. So, he and his men, including the Nazi science adviser, Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers, once again), they try to find out how they're going to stop this horrible situation before it's too late.MY THOUGHTS Although this movie isn't one of Kubrick's best, the black and white photography used in it is terrific. The movie is well-paced; it's never rushed. The direction by Stanley Kubrick is fantastic, and I wish he would have made more comedies during his career, but he didn't because he passed away back in 1999, so yeah. But anyway, the quotes said by the characters are very amusing and this is one of those movies where I can quote from it and never get tired of doing it. THE ACTING Peter Sellers, he plays three roles (Mandrake, Muffley, and Dr. Strangelove), and he did excellent. George C.

It's just as well with Miles - he's tired and he would like to get out, but not before giving a kick to the shins of the organization. He announces that he's writing a book that will reveal a lot of behind the scenes stuff and scandals. Naturally everyone, including the Russians, want him terminated.Thus begins, with the help of his girlfriend (Jackson), a game of hopscotch around the world as Kendig leads the powers that be on a merry chase. Aware that just about everything he touches is bugged, he feeds operatives all sorts of information, changes his name more than once, rents planes, flies commercial, steals a police car, and arranges for operatives to break into a hotel room where they think he is. In his greatest coup, he calls his ex-boss from his ex-boss' house, which is then blown to bits when there's an attempt to capture him - of course, he's long gone.Both funny and dramatic, you've really got your fingers crossed for Kendig, and the film keeps you guessing as to whether he can get away from the CIA -- and what his ultimate plan is, as well how various elements fit in.Matthau is his usual, implacable, flippant self, perfect for an operative and with the right temperament to try to escape CIA clutches. Jackson gives a classy, smooth performance as his helpmate. Sam Waterston plays it straight amidst the comic elements as he attempts to bring this spy in from the warm and into the cold.

What if Ali had lost? What if it was a flop? etc. Cynically, I assumed that had Ali lost, the documentary wouldn't have been made, but then I remembered that it waited 22 years to be made, and receive the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1997. In other words, it wasn't supposed to 'make a film'; it was a legend from the very start.And Rumble in the Jungle is the nostalgic celebration of the most legendary episode of Boxing History, through a recollection of images and stories from those who witnessed the event. It's a treasure in terms of archive footage, musical sequences, and extraordinary shots of Ali haranguing his African fans and shining everyone with his unique charisma or Don King discussing the black condition with James Brown. The match is almost secondary while the film is more of a magnificent tribute to the enormous contribution of African American people in sport and entertainment. Some would think that the genius of people is better measured on fields such as science, medicine, physics, literature or politics, but in these times, sport and music was the most likely medium where African American people could express their voice.And sport is probably the noblest expression of Humanity's true spirit self-accomplishment, victory and respect. While science and literature cruelly depend on the level of education one has received, sport is universal; it's no-money learning anyone can develop physical abilities with his own will. In a world full of segregation, sport offers the less segregationist environment. While intelligence can be used to disguise ignorance, strength cannot disguise weakness, the strongest is the strongest. Boxing is probably the most straight-forward incarnation of the true essence of sport, and on that discipline, Muhammad Ali was the greatest, a sort of semi-God like figure who had to prove his physical strength, before it transcended the limits of the ring, even at the risk of becoming an unpopular figure, an outcast &#x85; but sometimes, it's this very status that paves the way to the legend.One has to remember how truly unpopular Ali became when he refused to fight in Vietnam. As recalls Spike Lee, interviewed in the documentary, it's not just the refusal but the way it was stated No Vietcong ever called me a N-word. Ali shouted what every member of his community was secretly thinking, he had the guts to refuse to be a government's puppet, he lost his Heavyweight Champion title and couldn't fight for several years, but what it cost him in sports, elevated him above all the other athletes more than a spokesperson, he became a living icon, a myth and a model. Basically, his refusal taught people one thing that one can't ask for respect if he doesn't respect himself. And the man who 'shook up the world' by defeating Sonny Liston had too much self-esteem to fight against people he's got nothing against just because he's told to do so. Respect starts with self-respect and even school can't teach you to respect yourself.This is why the documentary might be guilty of a certain bias toward Ali, but it doesn't denigrate Foreman either. He is the 'quiet yet invulnerable' force, a Fighting Machine that knocked out and dethroned Joe Frazier after a technical knock-out, but his lack of flamboyance and eccentricity allowed Ali to conquer the hearts of all the Zairian people. Basically, Rumble in the Jungle could have been subtitled the Ali show. The film isn't pro-Ali or anti-Foreman, it even manages to draw a sort of retrospectively sympathetic portrait of 'Big George' who just couldn't outsize Ali, popularity-wise. An unfortunate irony is that even as a darker person, Foreman incarnated the 'White man' for the people, by arriving at the airport with a blonde shepherd, symbol of the previous Belgian colon. Misunderstood, Foreman also misunderstood the public, and the whole fight's symbolism, he showed as an African American man, while Ali was exalting the pride of the difference, this pride that started when he refused to assign.And this is exactly this pride of the difference that the film conveys through Ali's exuberant personality, even the title works like a slogan reminding that there was a time where Africa was the mother of humanity, when there was a pride to be Black, and people like Ali revived that pride. The film powerfully encapsulates the spirit within the black people in America or Africa, this 'Booma ye!' spirit ,where it was not about wanting to be 'assimilated', but to be 'respected'. Difference, not assimilation &#x85; and never had the Black pride been as authentic, as sincere, as expressed by Muhammad Ali, an equal of Nelson Mandela, Malcolm X and ironically to Patrice Lumumba who was ordered to be killed by the very President of Zaire, Mobutu himself. When We Were Kings provides an important slice of African life under dictatorship, proving that the people still had inner demons to exorcise, undermining the path to liberty.Nothing positive can be dictated by terror and beyond the whole show, orchestrated by Don King, Ali and Foreman were not there to express an antagonism, but to play a game, it was a performance. And the film, although trying sometimes to convey a false sense of suspense by depicting Ali as a challenger who had almost no chance to win -a theory contradicted by most boxing experts- the legend preceded the match. How about the victory then? Well, I guess my what if questions were unthinkable in Ali's mind. It's as if, as a Muslim, he believed that some things were like written by God (or Allah) himself wanted to make reality even more appealing as fiction. Indeed, while When We Were Kings is a documentary and a damn good one, I felt it as emotionally gripping as a fiction.

It's as if, as a Muslim, he believed that some things were like written by God (or Allah) himself wanted to make reality even more appealing as fiction. Indeed, while When We Were Kings is a documentary and a damn good one, I felt it as emotionally gripping as a fiction.

What if Ali had lost? What if it was a flop? etc. Cynically, I assumed that had Ali lost, the documentary wouldn't have been made, but then I remembered that it waited 22 years to be made, and receive the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1997. In other words, it wasn't supposed to 'make a film'; it was a legend from the very start.And Rumble in the Jungle is the nostalgic celebration of the most legendary episode of Boxing History, through a recollection of images and stories from those who witnessed the event. It's a treasure in terms of archive footage, musical sequences, and extraordinary shots of Ali haranguing his African fans and shining everyone with his unique charisma or Don King discussing the black condition with James Brown. The match is almost secondary while the film is more of a magnificent tribute to the enormous contribution of African American people in sport and entertainment. Some would think that the genius of people is better measured on fields such as science, medicine, physics, literature or politics, but in these times, sport and music was the most likely medium where African American people could express their voice.And sport is probably the noblest expression of Humanity's true spirit self-accomplishment, victory and respect. While science and literature cruelly depend on the level of education one has received, sport is universal; it's no-money learning anyone can develop physical abilities with his own will. In a world full of segregation, sport offers the less segregationist environment. While intelligence can be used to disguise ignorance, strength cannot disguise weakness, the strongest is the strongest. Boxing is probably the most straight-forward incarnation of the true essence of sport, and on that discipline, Muhammad Ali was the greatest, a sort of semi-God like figure who had to prove his physical strength, before it transcended the limits of the ring, even at the risk of becoming an unpopular figure, an outcast &#x85; but sometimes, it's this very status that paves the way to the legend.One has to remember how truly unpopular Ali became when he refused to fight in Vietnam. As recalls Spike Lee, interviewed in the documentary, it's not just the refusal but the way it was stated No Vietcong ever called me a N-word. Ali shouted what every member of his community was secretly thinking, he had the guts to refuse to be a government's puppet, he lost his Heavyweight Champion title and couldn't fight for several years, but what it cost him in sports, elevated him above all the other athletes more than a spokesperson, he became a living icon, a myth and a model. Basically, his refusal taught people one thing that one can't ask for respect if he doesn't respect himself. And the man who 'shook up the world' by defeating Sonny Liston had too much self-esteem to fight against people he's got nothing against just because he's told to do so. Respect starts with self-respect and even school can't teach you to respect yourself.This is why the documentary might be guilty of a certain bias toward Ali, but it doesn't denigrate Foreman either. He is the 'quiet yet invulnerable' force, a Fighting Machine that knocked out and dethroned Joe Frazier after a technical knock-out, but his lack of flamboyance and eccentricity allowed Ali to conquer the hearts of all the Zairian people. Basically, Rumble in the Jungle could have been subtitled the Ali show. The film isn't pro-Ali or anti-Foreman, it even manages to draw a sort of retrospectively sympathetic portrait of 'Big George' who just couldn't outsize Ali, popularity-wise. An unfortunate irony is that even as a darker person, Foreman incarnated the 'White man' for the people, by arriving at the airport with a blonde shepherd, symbol of the previous Belgian colon. Misunderstood, Foreman also misunderstood the public, and the whole fight's symbolism, he showed as an African American man, while Ali was exalting the pride of the difference, this pride that started when he refused to assign.And this is exactly this pride of the difference that the film conveys through Ali's exuberant personality, even the title works like a slogan reminding that there was a time where Africa was the mother of humanity, when there was a pride to be Black, and people like Ali revived that pride. The film powerfully encapsulates the spirit within the black people in America or Africa, this 'Booma ye!' spirit ,where it was not about wanting to be 'assimilated', but to be 'respected'. Difference, not assimilation &#x85; and never had the Black pride been as authentic, as sincere, as expressed by Muhammad Ali, an equal of Nelson Mandela, Malcolm X and ironically to Patrice Lumumba who was ordered to be killed by the very President of Zaire, Mobutu himself. When We Were Kings provides an important slice of African life under dictatorship, proving that the people still had inner demons to exorcise, undermining the path to liberty.Nothing positive can be dictated by terror and beyond the whole show, orchestrated by Don King, Ali and Foreman were not there to express an antagonism, but to play a game, it was a performance. And the film, although trying sometimes to convey a false sense of suspense by depicting Ali as a challenger who had almost no chance to win -a theory contradicted by most boxing experts- the legend preceded the match.

Despite it being known as, The Infamous Propaganda Film I think there's nothing bad about it. It's only looked at as infamous because of the Holocaust. But people seem to gap the idea of how Germany was before these shocking events happened.It's even more groovie that it is all the real deal footage. No actors, no glitches, no goofs and no errors. Just perfect and exactly how it should be for a film such as this. I love seeing the real life versions (not saying I hate the theatrical versions)of the Nazis. The film connects you into the party and brings you into an idea of what they were. For anyone who is willing to watch anything on Hitler Put this film before any other documentary or film.
