Highlander Endgame was what I have been waiting so long for. I have been an avid follower of the Highlander movies and the Highlander TV series. Even despite the fact that I abhorred the last two movie sequels (Highlander 2 The Quickening and Highlander 3 The Final Dimension), I had a feeling that this one was gonna be the one that was going to redeem the Highlander name. Boy was I right.Highlander Endgame is pure energy. From the sword fights to the hand to hand combat, everything is full of intensity. That's not to say that action was the only thing driving the movie. Highlander Endgame's story is very good as well. I would even say it has all the magic of the first movie, if not more. Things such as revelations of certain characters' past and the relationship between Duncan and Conner are brought out very well and you can't help but be absorbed in their world.On the topic of the first movie, it has to be noted that Highlander Endgame does not tie in with the first movie (nor any of the others for that matter). In fact, Highlander Endgame follows the story of the TV show. So like the TV show (and unlike the end of the first movie), Conner is not the only immortal left, and the prize still has not been won. That's probably the reason the producers decided not to title this one, Highlander 4. I have heard numerous people complain over the fact that this movie should not exist because of the end of the first movie. If you're one of those people, please understand that the TV show and the movie are not of the same universe, so the stories do not coincide.So if you're a big Highlander fan, I highly recommend watching Highlander Endgame. Even if you're not a Highlander fan, you should still check out this movie, even though there  are some things that you'll have to know beforehand to understand some of the elements in the movie. But do not let that detract you from this awesome movie. By the way, yes, there are some scenes from the trailer that did not make it to the final cut of the movie.

Almost all of the comments that apply to Urban Legend can be applied to Scream but very few people criticise the latter but everyone seems to criticise the former. Don't get me wrong.. I was a big fan of Scream because it was simply entertainment - and good entertainment at that. There was no reason to analyse the script to bits or point out numerous things wrong with the plot. If you were to do that, I Know What you Did Last Summer would simply drown before it even had a chance, yet it was successful too simply because in both those movies, you could forget all these things and enjoy slash after slash. Who cares if it was feasible or not - they arn't the type of movies that need to be analysed since they often poke fun at themselves too; its all part of the ride. The plot twists in the film are definitely good but if you are going to watch the flick thinking its going to be a second rate Scream, then you're probably not going to give it much of a chance anyway.At the end of the day one word sums up what Urban Legend does - entertain, and IMHO, does it of course better than Last Summer, but also Scream. People will say that Urban Legend pretends to be horror while Scream was simply humerous but the introduction of Scream was far too horrific to be the start of a comic-horror flick; it also has an identiy crisis and its ending was far more ludicrous that Urban Legend's ending by far.At the end of the day, if Scream hadn't existed, most of these comments wouldn't be here in my opinion since this would have been its replacement. Although it loses marks for originiality since it was basically another 'Scream' movie, it seems to take everything from Scream and make it much better so whats wrong with that?Two thumbs up here  lets hope the second movie doesn't disappoint.

But the one thing that was claimed made it into more than the average comic adaptation was the character development that, in my opinion, doesn't exist. There are simply too many potentially interesting characters here to explore them all in 95 minutes. Hence, except for Hugh Jackman's and Anna Paquin's characters, all others get short shrift. As opposed to many other (made from comic) movies, the characters here leave you stunningly detached. No wonder- with this little time, one might say. But that also seemed to be the case with the actors. None of them seems to take great interest in differentiating their roles through their portrayal. But how could they? The narrative squanders aimlessly, the dialogue is probably as bad as it gets, and a little irony towards the material (as displayed in the Superman features) would have gone a long way towards preventing X-Men from total cheesiness. Well, it's not cheesy throughout, mind you, but at least once too often. Besides, as I expected, the film is nowhere near as clever or important as it has often been claimed the message of tolerance is a good one as a concept, but because of the script (which is less than stellar, I might add. Couldn't Christopher McQuarrie have done it?) and foremost the sheer haste with which Bryan Singer sweeps through the story and past any REAL drama, the film ultimately sabotages its own point. The heroes are heroes. The villains are villains. Good is good. Bad is bad. But please, live together peacefully! Any shades of gray get lost somewhere between the ten or so main characters. Pity. This really could have had a point to make.That said, I must, however, admit, that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. As popcorn entertainment, it's great, and certainly more worthwhile than any of the latest Bruckheimer action flicks. And I'd personally embrace any movie featuring Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen and Anna Paquin altogether. But somehow, it all left me a bit disappointed considering the hype about how different from other comic adaptations this was supposed to be.

This movie was one of the worst of 1999.  After all of the great movies that came out in the  year 1997 and 98, I thought for sure that 1999 would be great, but I should have known since I really didn't see a lot of good action trailers for 1999 movie season.The writing was bad and as far as I'm concerned, if you saw Will Smith in ID4 and MIB and in Bad Boys, you've seen Wild Wild West.  He's practically playing the same characters in every movie he is in and I'm getting sick of it.  That's one of the reasons why I couldn't stand this movie.  And I some how knew Salma Hayek would appear nude in the film the first time I saw her on screen and realized that this movie was going no where.  Sure enough that happened later in the film and I'm like, GROW UP PEOPLE!!!!!!  This exploitation of females in the movies has got to stop!  When Smith did his nude scene in the film, it was done in a way that you wouldn't be able to see much if not anything at all.  Not that I want to see Smith nude because I don't.  And I don't want to see her either because I respect females in the movie and would rather not have to look at them in that form.  It's being down right disrespectful.I didn't like the constant fighting between West and Gordon.  I have seen the original series, and I can tell you that when it came down to who was in charge, West was.  Did West flaunt it?  No.  Why?  Because who was there to bail West out of trouble?  Gordon was.  So we have an equilibrium here.  I liked the casting of Kline in the movie as Gordon, but all in all, I didn't like the chemistry.The plot was bad, the jokes were bad, the egos were being tossed all over the place and wanted my money back.  When I go to a movie I really enjoy, I feel as though it was done so with money well spent.  With this movie, I felt like my money had disappeared and was gone in sixty seconds.

This movie was one of the worst of 1999.  After all of the great movies that came out in the  year 1997 and 98, I thought for sure that 1999 would be great, but I should have known since I really didn't see a lot of good action trailers for 1999 movie season.The writing was bad and as far as I'm concerned, if you saw Will Smith in ID4 and MIB and in Bad Boys, you've seen Wild Wild West.  He's practically playing the same characters in every movie he is in and I'm getting sick of it.  That's one of the reasons why I couldn't stand this movie.

This movie contains characters from the TV series who are not explained in the movie.  Also, this movie conforms to the Highlander universe as shown in the TV series, which is a good thing, considering that the first 3 Highlander movies had so many inconsistencies.  To someone who had not seen the TV series, this movie would be confusing.Adrian Paul shows off his fighting skills very well in the fight with the chinese master.  Since this actor had great skill also, we had a very good view of the fight.  Unfortunately, almost all of Paul's other fight scenes were with much less skilled actors\/stuntmen, so the filming and editing had to make up for this with closeups that make things look more confusing and faster than they really are.That is a pet peeve of mine in movies.  Make up for the lack of skill or special effects by filming too close up, and editing it too look like events are more complicated and confusing than they really are.  Gladiator was one of the worst in this respect.The final fight scene is the only one, really, where we get to see the head villan in action.  The actor is clearly not very good at swordplay, so the best moves are when you can't see his face (thus a stuntman).  Even then, you find it hard to believe that the character (Kell), had the skill to defeat so many Immortals before.  We know that Duncan is a much better swordsman, but it doesn't appear that way in the fight.I know that it was important to show that Connor was more experienced and world-weary than Duncan, but I think that Duncan appeared to be more juvenile, young, and head-strong than he did in the TV series.The editing of this movie left me feeling a bit disoriented.  The flashbacks were important, as they were in the TV series, but in the movie, they seemed to break up the flow of the story too much.

It is almost the very living definition of what is NOT cool, especially mid-90s.

Of course, Jay and Silent Bob are the best things about the whole movie. Ben Affleck was pretty weak, and the set up to bust him at the end of the movie is so absurd it's not funny, it's just dumb.The entire girl's father running his game show with a live feed from the local mall is horrible.

I was one of the people who saw the movie on the first day, 1201AM showing.  Although I will say this much, unlike some people who stayed in line all day, I stood in line for about fifteen minutes, was told that the movie sold out, then told that there was a drawing being held, lost the drawing, then had my Mother go up to the lady passing out winning tickets and had her ask for two tickets in which the lady said okay.  And I am happy this I got in that way because I would have been upset having waited for so long and paid money for that.Don't get me wrong, but I was not to happy with the movie itself.  It seemed rushed and the plot didn't work for me.  They spent too much time focusing on Jar Jar Binks and his dopey running and falling down bit, and not enough on the story and the characters.  I wanted to know more about Darth Maul, let's get more information about why the blockade was surrounding the planet, lets focus more about Darth Sideous and how he it into the grand scheme(as if most of us don't know, but I still think it would be good to have that in the movie) what about the relationship between the Gungan's (did I spell that right?) and the Naboo, why are they enemies, and if they are not enemies, why are they separated like that.  Those are things that could have been focused on, not Jar Jar sticking his tounge out at everyone.  What about Anikin, why not focus on his fears, why is he so angry, we need that for the back story for Darth Vader's birth.  Give us just a little more information on the corruption in the Senate.  What about the head of the Senate, why is he corrupt?  These are things that needed to be focused on.  Sword fights, battles and special effects don't make the movie.  The space battle should have been just a little bit more intense at least focusing in a little on the pilots and seeing a few of them get killed and shoot down some of the enemy fighters and throw out some flight lingo.  That's what made the space fights so cool in the previous movie.We take a look at some of the earlier movies and you got to see the emotional feelings the major characters had.  We got to see Luke Skywalker's life, how he wanted more but was being held back.  He wanted a life of adventure whereas  his uncle wanted  him on the farm.  We see Han Solo as the selfish smuggler who only worries about two things, himself and money.  But you also saw another part in him, the brave side, risking his life by running down the Stormtroopers while Skywalker and the Princess made their escape.  We get the impression that Princess Leia is a very strong person who is also a very high ranking person in the rebellion.  We learn things about the characters along the way.  Solo's debt with Jaba the Hut.  Princess Leia cover as diplomat being blown, her home planet being destroyed.  We find she is a very determined woman who will not betray her friends even under torture.  We really don't learn too much about C-3P0, R2-D2 and Chewbacca untill the next movie and as for Darth Vader, we can see that this is the man.  Don't mess with him, he is very powerful.  You learn about Obi Wan Kinobi and how he trained Luke's Father and fought with him during the wars and get a glimse of what happened to Luke's Father.In the next movie, Lando Calressian appears, and even though he isn't in the movie very long, we learn a little about him.  We know he is a friend of Han Solo, the Millenium Falcon was his, he is an expert con artist and won control of Cloud City through a gambling debt.   We know enough that he has lead an adventurous life and that he is a very brave person.  Lando is one of the few characters to ever confront Vader with a verbal assault and one of the few people who double cross Vader when the deal goes sour to rescue his friends.  Boba Fett arrives.  Not much is given on his character, but the man is good and we can see he is very clever.  Admiral Piett enters into the movie and we see him go from a regular command officer to the commanding officer, a promotion that causes him serious emotional problems due to fear of failing Vader.This was character development.  These characters were well developed from the start even though they did not have much screen time.  The characters in this movie seem to just appear.  We know little of the history of Qui Gon Jin except that he has had problems inside the Jedi Counsil.  Obi Wan is just a pupil, Anikin is upset about being a slave, and as for the Queen, we know that she is strong individual who can take charge.  But nothing above that.  There are other important characters who jump in and that's it.  Captain Panaka is just there as the body guard, Ric Ollie is there as a fighter pilot.  We have Senator Palpatine who gets control of the Senate about the end of the movie.  What about Boss Nass.  What about the Queen's body guard.  What about Anikin's Mother.  There needed to be more development of some of these characters and more storyline around all the cast members and especially more around the real major characters.  Let's pull them out a little and make them characters, not people on screen reading lines.Star Wars The Phantom Menace was okay, but it needed a lot of work.

I was one of the people who saw the movie on the first day, 1201AM showing.  Although I will say this much, unlike some people who stayed in line all day, I stood in line for about fifteen minutes, was told that the movie sold out, then told that there was a drawing being held, lost the drawing, then had my Mother go up to the lady passing out winning tickets and had her ask for two tickets in which the lady said okay.  And I am happy this I got in that way because I would have been upset having waited for so long and paid money for that.Don't get me wrong, but I was not to happy with the movie itself.  It seemed rushed and the plot didn't work for me.  They spent too much time focusing on Jar Jar Binks and his dopey running and falling down bit, and not enough on the story and the characters.  I wanted to know more about Darth Maul, let's get more information about why the blockade was surrounding the planet, lets focus more about Darth Sideous and how he it into the grand scheme(as if most of us don't know, but I still think it would be good to have that in the movie) what about the relationship between the Gungan's (did I spell that right?) and the Naboo, why are they enemies, and if they are not enemies, why are they separated like that.  Those are things that could have been focused on, not Jar Jar sticking his tounge out at everyone.  What about Anikin, why not focus on his fears, why is he so angry, we need that for the back story for Darth Vader's birth.  Give us just a little more information on the corruption in the Senate.  What about the head of the Senate, why is he corrupt?  These are things that needed to be focused on.  Sword fights, battles and special effects don't make the movie.  The space battle should have been just a little bit more intense at least focusing in a little on the pilots and seeing a few of them get killed and shoot down some of the enemy fighters and throw out some flight lingo.  That's what made the space fights so cool in the previous movie.We take a look at some of the earlier movies and you got to see the emotional feelings the major characters had.  We got to see Luke Skywalker's life, how he wanted more but was being held back.  He wanted a life of adventure whereas  his uncle wanted  him on the farm.

Wesley Snipes was only funny when if he was deadpanning a line but the rest of the time he was just stupid which was displayed very well in his conversation about McDonalds.Snipes stars as Neil Shaw, a secret agent for the UN or something, who gets framed for the murder of a famous Chinese guy. That's about all the movie wants you to know. Snipes is only adequate in the lead role. His best scenes are ones where he's shooting people or snapping their necks.

Specifically fans of the series AND the movies, as fans of just the movies will probably be extremely confused (Watchers?  Joe? Methos?) and those new to the whole concept will be totally out of their depth.  That having been said, I still walked away a bit confused and I AM a fan of both the series and the movies.  You can definitely call this film a victim of overzealous editors, though I'm not entirely convinced of the strength of the underlying story in the first place.  Which surprises me, because I expected great things of Gillian Horvath based on past experience from both Highlander and Forever Knight.First off, the good things.  Adrian Paul is to DIE for&#133;and is definitely no slouch either as an actor or a choreographed fighter.  And it's always great to see Peter Wingfield and Jim Byrnes (though more Methos and Joe would definitely have been appreciated, along with a bit of explanation for the non-series-fans about what the heck Watchers were).

Rather appropriately then, this is a male-dominated film, with women having no role (apart from the wooden-as-a-crate twin daughters of Tony the Head) except to bare their breasts. This laddish, sixth-form sexism goes hand-in-hand with the usual sub-racism and homophobia that punctuates a Ritchie endeavour.In many ways this is worse than the comparatively laid-back Barrels, as its clumsy post-modernism is even more apparent a quote from Pulp Fiction is used, the Michael Caine homage is more heart-felt, and Reservoir Dogs is referenced even before the close of the beginning titles.The contrived plot and action-led pace are, however, thrown together with such veracity that, like Lock, Stock..., it is readily watchable, if not actually any good. For a first time viewing, at any rate. What crushes it is Ritchie's need to make every line a funny line, which takes away all sense of reality. Look at the scene where a betting shop assistant is held at gunpoint, refusing to hand over money, and being told I ain't f****** buying that! Well, she replies, a tad unrealistically as she's under threat of death, that's fine, cos I ain't f****** selling it. You suspect that if Ritchie had the guts to make a serious, sincere UK gangster movie then it would be more bearable, rather than one which gorges on the rotting carcasses of superior stablemates.Where the film crucially falls down is in it's casting. How so many bad actors could be in one movie is staggering. What is worse, the few that do give a decent performance are given minimal roles, or roles that make the least of their talents, with a was he actually in the film? appearance from Trainspotting's Ewan Bremner. Alan Ford is okay as Brick Top, though others &#x96; most notably Ade in his movie debut &#x96; are awful, though doubtlessly hindered by the weak script. Mike Read appears as Tony the Head (which sounds less like a gangster, more the male equivalent of Linda Lovelace), though is wasted by being reduced to a cursory cameo role. He doesn't even get to say wot are yer, some kind o' pilchard?The other two decent performances come from Brad Pitt, and, surprisingly, Vinnie Jones. After humiliating himself with a lame turn in Gone In Sixty Seconds, he does better here than most of the professionals with him; even though when he uses big words, you doubt if he knows what they really mean. Brad is, of course, the main appeal, almost unrecognisable as a tattooed, nonsense-Irish speaking bare-knuckle fist fighter. When he's on the screen, it almost lights up, only to darken again when he leaves it. Not a wholly successful addition, the standard of his acting and obvious presence make you think he's in a different film to most of the third-rates walking around pretending to be Bob Hoskins. Yet it is clear Brad loved his role in a low-budget Brit movie, and even appears to ad-lib his obscenity to an over-zealous dog. (Also look out for the hastily cut scene where Vinnie starts to crack up as another dog gets carried away and attacks an actor he wasn't supposed to). There are precisely three laughs in the movie, all of which are unintentional. The first two I've just detailed, the last sees dance artist Goldie indulging in some attempted thesping. Stick to being a gangster, Lee, leave this game to me and Sol, he is told by Robbie Gee.One last moan?

I was literally speechless when i left the cinema.I'm not saying the mummy is the greatest film ever, because after having watched it well over 50 times by now, i know this is not so, but what amazed me was how efficient and how enjoyable the film was. Not many films leave me feeling the way the mummy did.I was already a fan of Stephen Sommers' earlier film Deep Rising (1998), but i didn't expect that he could follow up with such a treat.The acting is great, everyone involved effectively sends up their characters. Brendan Fraser is the perfect goofy hero, putting himself up there with Bruce Campbell and the like. He has made a seamless move into the blockbuster territory. Rachel Weisz is pretty good, but pretty unspectacular as the love interest (I can think of many young actresses who could just have easily played the role), but it is refreshing to see a British actress given a major role in a hollywood film. Which brings me on to another fellow Brit, John Hannah, who can't fail but be excellent in everything he turns his unique talents to (remember the funeral scene in Four Weddings?). Arnold Vosloo came as a surprise, I remember him from Hard Target (1993), but unfortunately very little else. I find this surprising as he is a very striking actor, with great ability. He has very little to say in the film, but dialogue is only half of acting. His screen presence added a lot to the film, and i hope to see him in a lot more. The real star of the show though, is the criminally underated Kevin J 'O'Conner. He plays the main comedy relief, and is just so excellent at it. His performance seems so effortless (Even though he plays a bad guy, that is meant as a compliment) and like Vosloo, he adds a lot to the film.The script, like Deep Rising, spends a lot of time poking fun at itself, and the main thing is, it doesn't take itself too seriously. There is a great deal of intelligent humour, intertwined with belly laughs, which is a winning formula for a blockbuster.The main thing in any film of this type though, is always the special effects, which are near perfect.

Some of the digital makeup on Vosloo, was a little sloppy, and a few easy to spot green screen shots, are the only glitch in the effects.What the film does lack is a sense of atmosphere, which is a great shame, because a lot of effort has been put into the sets, so much so, that at times you do feel like you're in a studio. A very predictable storyline, and ending is another flaw with the film, but these are only minor defaults, because the film is not about story, it's about fun.If you want two hours of pure old fashioned Indiana Jones inspired hijinks, then check this film out.

There is a great deal of intelligent humour, intertwined with belly laughs, which is a winning formula for a blockbuster.The main thing in any film of this type though, is always the special effects, which are near perfect. The scarab beetles are superb, the sandstorm absolutely gobsmacking on the big screen (the shot where the plane flies towards the camera, with the sandstorm appearing over a cliff in the bakground then crashing down mere feet in front of us blew me away), the undead mummies at the end of the film, as well as the warrior mummies were expertley rendered and animated, paying homage to the work of Ray Harryhausen, and the main Mummy itself, before regenerating was quite a lot like the termintator, but still very impressive. Some of the digital makeup on Vosloo, was a little sloppy, and a few easy to spot green screen shots, are the only glitch in the effects.What the film does lack is a sense of atmosphere, which is a great shame, because a lot of effort has been put into the sets, so much so, that at times you do feel like you're in a studio. A very predictable storyline, and ending is another flaw with the film, but these are only minor defaults, because the film is not about story, it's about fun.If you want two hours of pure old fashioned Indiana Jones inspired hijinks, then check this film out. It won't be to everyone's tastes, but what is?4.5 out of 5 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"6 September 2000","score":"","review":"  I saw The Cell on opening day and I must say since I have not read any of the other reviews I was let down. The story is nothing that we have not seen before in the past. The one plus of the film was, as everyone might say, was the visuals. But, there were not much of them. The film kept going back and forth from the inner non-real world to the real world. It should have stayed in the non real world. Let me put it quickly, from one who is really jonesing for something different The Cell would have been much more interesting if the following were implemented. 1)Lopez should have been the bad guy-girl. She should have been in Vincent D's place. Lopez would have been cool in this way if not for her voice alone. Lopez is sweet and her voice would have thrown people because of its sweetness masking an evil person\/demon killer. Dynamics are enhanced. Sweetness going to Evil Demon is much more stressful. Also, the costumes and makeup would have been so much more interesting on her i.e. black makeup in sword scene. 2)The film should have located itself in the non real world for most of the film-that's where all the interesting s**t was happening. 3) By doing #2 the visual imagery that Tarsem was going after would have been increased and a lot more dynamic. The visuals were cool but we did not get to see them enough. I ask all who have seen the movie, was it not the moment we see Ms Olympia Kim Chivesky-whatever move toward Lopez and swoop her up the ooh aah high point of the movie? That's the s**t. People are overwhelmed by those things that they believe just can't be. And seeing Kim w\/the lighting the way it was, handle Lopez in that quick edit was unsettling. That scene was a jar dropper and it is those kinds of scenes that would have made The Cell something that it was selling itself as; a truly visual thriller.
