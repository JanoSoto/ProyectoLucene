The movie tells the story of tommy, a boy that gets a trauma when his father gets killed by his stepfather and mother, followed by them telling TommyYou didn't see it, you didn't hear it, no word of it for anyone in life multiple times. That made him act like he is deaf, blind and dumb for his whole life, suffering and suffering throughout the whole movie. It's a movie that you need to have your mind open to enjoy. Also keep your mind ready to understand the hundreds of messages and symbols in the movie, or else you won't find it that genius. The movie does psychological analysis on the character of tommy, quotes the story of Jesus, with great charismatic characters that are represented by great actors, followed by the sublime The who discography. Without dialog, only music. If you're the kind of person that likes to think, and also likes rock, this may be your favorite movie, although, that's not a movie for everyone, if you're used to movies that are easier to digest that don't require too much reflection to justify what you've just seen, you may find this movie just creepy and bizarre, as most of the scenes in the movie require some thought to make sense, like the scene where Tommy is tossed to the mirror. I simply loved it, each second of it and every thing in it has an utility for the story, be it to symbolize something(Like the recurring metallic sphere in the movie) or to just make something clear for the audience. The movie almost never gives answers to you right away, if you question what you've seen, search through your own mind to find the answer. The only thing i know that gives me the same feeling of watching Tommy, also providing psychological analysis of the character and symbolism is Neon Genesis Evangelion, although Tommy doesn't give you ANYTHING mainstream, it's all different and strange in the movie. For rock and thinking lovers, this movie is a must watch, if you are new to both subjects, you should watch it too, the best rock opera of all time.

All jumbled together the film is fun to watch and with some great jokes physical and verbally, this is one comedy that I see never getting old. Done well by the late Harold Ramis, I felt the film was actually a firmly very good one, and here below is why I felt that way about it.The story is hectic but one of pure humour and a kind of comedy that is hard to really see done well in the present day, but the Griswold family make the film there own and bring laugh out loud jokes along with them. It goes at a nice pace and they seem to never over stay there welcome when they come across a new place, this allows for the diversity of the film to show and has a lot of different and new fast things all the time.Chevy Chase is just brilliant in the main role as the dad of the family, he just brings out everything a comedy actor in this type of role needs to be, if you ever think about making a family comedy, look no further than Chase for inspiration. Beverly D'Angelo and the two kids provide good support to kind of push Chase over the edge, the comedy is flowing out when they are in the car together. There are so many new people seen that they also have different effects on Chase and the family, it is just great to see his reactions.Directed by Harold Ramis, it is done well by him and his touch can be seen in every scene with just a little new direction here and a little there. The screenplay is also one of comedies greats, it has so many great lines in it and John Hughes is of course the man to provide such a thing. It is never done lazily by either also, and it seems that a lot of thought was put into even the most stupid of jokes, just good good fun.The only criticisms I would have of Vacation, it can be kind of crude and maybe at times over does it, not as a whole movie but certain parts anyway. I think it all depends on what type of humour you enjoy the most, the film does lack what it had at the beginning toward the end but still manages to get some massive laughs out of you first. One more thing, the acting is never great from anyone but what do you expect, it is a comedy and Chevy Chase is by far the main character but also the best actor here in the film.I think if you like 80's screwball comedies and the kind of funny film that moves along the USA with a fast pace of jokes, this is for you all over. If you also like a bit of rude or crude humour dabbled in, but not always, then this is also one to watch. I think some may not like it mostly from the fact the jokes can be silly, they are funny though and I guess the film would have to come down to personal preferences.Overall it is truly a Firmly Very Good movie, it has comedy elements we need to see more of these days but also the typical trademarks so many great 80's comedies provided. Sit back and relax, they say this is for the people who saw it in the 80's but I disagree, it is for everyone and even modern audiences alike would enjoy this, thoroughly funny, great jokes all around and just some stupid-ness from all the cast in between, go watch it now if you want to be entertained.

It also happens to feature a pair of excellent performances from Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. But something in the film leaves you cold, cold enough for me to place this far behind the likes of TAXI DRIVER, GOODFELLAS and CASINO.The problem with the film is the script, I think, which fails to make much headway with Jake LaMotta's character. Yes, the film is all about a portrayal of a man who turns out to be a monster, but there's not much of a character arc. LaMotta stays the same from beginning to end, but the film as a whole lacks the grandiose nature of something like SCARFACE, which told a similar story but in a much more dramatic and cinematic way. In contrast, RAGING BULL is cold and a bit depressing.There's still much to like here, though, and inevitably De Niro's performance stands head and shoulders above all else. De Niro undertakes a dramatic physical transformation for the role years before Christian Bale made it trendy to do so, and he's absolutely electric. But, again, he's played characters that are much more interesting in other films. I just didn't think much about LaMotta despite the interest of the warts 'n' all scripting. Trust Scorsese to get another fine performance from Pesci, though, the first of three stunning acting performances from the actor\/director combo.On a final note, RAGING BULL comes recommended thanks to THOSE fight scenes. In contrast to the rough 'n' tough bouts of the ROCKY franchise, these are extremely violent and yet also extremely artistic; probably the best filmed of all sports sequences in a movie. I just wish that Scorsese hadn't gone for black-and-white, though, as I think the movie would have been more effective in colour so you could see every drop of blood. It reminds me of Tarantino's hand being forced into making the huge set-piece massacre in KILL BILL VOL. 1 black-and-white.

DippéStoryline We then see a masked man kick in the door at an airbase and shoot up the people inside it before setting up a rocket launcher to assassinate his target. You see him wearing night-vision goggles that have unrealistic zoom, but also give him eyes similar to that of hellspawn, so it is foreshadowing in way. After 5 minutes or so of opening credits we get to see a news report covering the rocket attack, we're also introduced to a fat guy in the shadows who is talking with the head of some assassin service that is making a biological weapon. Al Simmons and his friend go to visit the head of the service to show his disdain at the fact of him having to kill civilians, he wants out and is sent on a final mission to take out a bio-weapons plant in North Korea. Simmons gets to the main part of the plant but finds out it was a trap and is betrayed by the people he works for and sent to hell. Simmons is then brought back from the dead but is still completely disfigured because of the burning and has to live among the homeless and the same guy from the beginning gives us exposition of what is happening and why Simmons was brought back. He then has to go through training or sorts with Clown\/Violator a short fat demon who ironically hates clowns, this character is what I like to call painful comic relief. The Violator makes him go through flashbacks so we can find out what happened after he died, and it turns out he made a deal with the devil which had strings attached. He is then taken into another flashback of when he rises from the grave and scared a couple goths who were hanging around the graves. This is also the part where we get to see the actual Spawn suit as the memories came and eat away at Spawn. The bad guy and Spawn's old friend Terry have gone to a party full of world officials. This is when Spawn breaks in through the sky light, tries to kill Jason the big bad. Spawn gets to Wanda's house where there is a trap waiting for him, an interesting little twist is there as well, but after Spawn does the right thing, he then kills the clown after battling with him in hell and sends him back to hell. Acting Michael Jai White is a great choice for Spawn, he is able to present the sorrow and aggression that the character would be feeling. He wears the cloak of Spawn and owns it. It would be hard to top his performance, I also think than not even Snipes could have hit the nail on the head as White does. My feels about John Leguizamo as Violator have been mentioned earlier how I have nothing against the actor, it's just the fact I do not like the character, but regardless he comes across as vile, vulgar and vicious. Just how the character should be, so he is a good actor in this. Noticeable Camera work The voyeuristic shots from the birthday party scene are where we first start to see the decent use of camera angles, before this it is the standards of close ups, mid shots and wide shots. This is an interesting thing that the movie does, it has Spawns cloak cover the screen so it can be used as a transition, this is nicely done and is a piece of editing not camera work, but is still creative as all hell. The scene that takes place after the police scene is a great shot, it has Spawn standing on the edge of a church with his cloak blowing in the winds, it works well regardless of which dark caped crusader does it. Be it Spawn, Batman or (Insert other dark brooding caped hero here)Graphics The CGI hasn't dated too well on this movie, but the effects are very nice to look at but not all too realistic for the most part. The world leaders meeting scene has Spawn breaking in through a sky light and his cloak stopping the fall, his cloak does look blatantly CGI, but it looks majestic as all hell, so I don't really care that much. The CGI for the violator's transformation scene is well done similar to that of Spawns transformation and stands up to that of late 2000's CGI. There are also some popping eyeballs that look like they are from the mask. Costume We are first introduced to the suit in the grave scene and apart from the cheesy CGI green lightning the suit is BA to the extreme in the way it looks like suits that are made for today's movies. It looks similar to the venom symbiotic suit in Spiderman 3. It matches the comic suit perfectly as well. My only complaint would be that he spends most of the movie with his mask off and I have a feeling that White asked for this so he could have more screen time, similar to what Stallone wanted in the movie Judge Dredd. That or voices couldn't be heard that well from it. Overall Feel Just a couple interesting facts about Spawn, the first being this was the first superhero movie to feature an African American as the lead character, there is the movie 'Steel' which came out a fortnight after which also had an African American lead superhero. Wesley Snipes was considered for the part of Spawn, but that was handed over to Michael Jai White instead, Snipes would then go to play the BA vampire killer Blade the year after. Also I will warn you now, this movie has a number of god awful puns with some puns which are actually good.

Spawn gets to Wanda's house where there is a trap waiting for him, an interesting little twist is there as well, but after Spawn does the right thing, he then kills the clown after battling with him in hell and sends him back to hell. Acting Michael Jai White is a great choice for Spawn, he is able to present the sorrow and aggression that the character would be feeling. He wears the cloak of Spawn and owns it. It would be hard to top his performance, I also think than not even Snipes could have hit the nail on the head as White does. My feels about John Leguizamo as Violator have been mentioned earlier how I have nothing against the actor, it's just the fact I do not like the character, but regardless he comes across as vile, vulgar and vicious. Just how the character should be, so he is a good actor in this. Noticeable Camera work The voyeuristic shots from the birthday party scene are where we first start to see the decent use of camera angles, before this it is the standards of close ups, mid shots and wide shots. This is an interesting thing that the movie does, it has Spawns cloak cover the screen so it can be used as a transition, this is nicely done and is a piece of editing not camera work, but is still creative as all hell. The scene that takes place after the police scene is a great shot, it has Spawn standing on the edge of a church with his cloak blowing in the winds, it works well regardless of which dark caped crusader does it. Be it Spawn, Batman or (Insert other dark brooding caped hero here)Graphics The CGI hasn't dated too well on this movie, but the effects are very nice to look at but not all too realistic for the most part. The world leaders meeting scene has Spawn breaking in through a sky light and his cloak stopping the fall, his cloak does look blatantly CGI, but it looks majestic as all hell, so I don't really care that much. The CGI for the violator's transformation scene is well done similar to that of Spawns transformation and stands up to that of late 2000's CGI. There are also some popping eyeballs that look like they are from the mask. Costume We are first introduced to the suit in the grave scene and apart from the cheesy CGI green lightning the suit is BA to the extreme in the way it looks like suits that are made for today's movies. It looks similar to the venom symbiotic suit in Spiderman 3. It matches the comic suit perfectly as well. My only complaint would be that he spends most of the movie with his mask off and I have a feeling that White asked for this so he could have more screen time, similar to what Stallone wanted in the movie Judge Dredd. That or voices couldn't be heard that well from it. Overall Feel Just a couple interesting facts about Spawn, the first being this was the first superhero movie to feature an African American as the lead character, there is the movie 'Steel' which came out a fortnight after which also had an African American lead superhero. Wesley Snipes was considered for the part of Spawn, but that was handed over to Michael Jai White instead, Snipes would then go to play the BA vampire killer Blade the year after. Also I will warn you now, this movie has a number of god awful puns with some puns which are actually good.

DippéStoryline We then see a masked man kick in the door at an airbase and shoot up the people inside it before setting up a rocket launcher to assassinate his target. You see him wearing night-vision goggles that have unrealistic zoom, but also give him eyes similar to that of hellspawn, so it is foreshadowing in way. After 5 minutes or so of opening credits we get to see a news report covering the rocket attack, we're also introduced to a fat guy in the shadows who is talking with the head of some assassin service that is making a biological weapon. Al Simmons and his friend go to visit the head of the service to show his disdain at the fact of him having to kill civilians, he wants out and is sent on a final mission to take out a bio-weapons plant in North Korea. Simmons gets to the main part of the plant but finds out it was a trap and is betrayed by the people he works for and sent to hell. Simmons is then brought back from the dead but is still completely disfigured because of the burning and has to live among the homeless and the same guy from the beginning gives us exposition of what is happening and why Simmons was brought back. He then has to go through training or sorts with Clown\/Violator a short fat demon who ironically hates clowns, this character is what I like to call painful comic relief. The Violator makes him go through flashbacks so we can find out what happened after he died, and it turns out he made a deal with the devil which had strings attached. He is then taken into another flashback of when he rises from the grave and scared a couple goths who were hanging around the graves.

This type of scene can go wrong very quickly or even just fall flat if not done correctly, but this movie makes it turn from a comical little chat into something more with the words I want to know who I'm looking at along with the sudden drop in the music. The man on the phone gets more violent with the fact of him knowing what she looks like, with all things adding up to make her more frightened while still adding suspense to the opening scene. You will also see that Scream made the I want to play a game line a lot more sinister for its time before it was used by the Saw franchise. The level of psychological torture that the man puts her through in the first scene is made all the more haunting by his monotone voice. Along with the woman actually sounding scared for her life and the life of her boyfriend and not like she is trying to sound scared for the camera. Which is more than what can be said for the parents. After the first scene we are introduced to two more teens, the main characters of this movie, who seem to have a relationship of sorts. We are then shown the high school that the girl from the first scene goes to as well the main girl. Afterward, we are introduced to the bunch of friends who we will be watching for this movie, one of which is called Stuart who is played by Matthew Lillard. This is a character I cannot take seriously, mainly because he also played and does the voice of Shaggy Rogers from the Scooby Doo movies. Our main character Sidney is left home alone because her father has gone away on a trip, so Sidney goes over to stay at a friends house. In a real world situation, this is actually a very smart thing to do under the logic of safety in numbers. Ghostface finds were she is and starts attacking her when she goes back inside, but runs off when her boyfriend comes, naturally she adds two and two together and suspects he's the killer, he gets arrested and she goes with her friend. But even at her friends house she still gets the man calling her with her boyfriend held in custody. Soon after getting attacked in school, Sidney goes to her friends to watch a movie feeling it would be safe there. There also is a subtle reference in the school with Frank the cleaner being dressed like Freddy Kruger. This is in the same scene where the camera is focusing on the headmaster walking around the school after hours. You can tell he is going to be attack and\/or killed because he is not even a secondary character and is getting screen time. Because of all the murders people are jumping at all sorts of conclusions of who is the killer, this also instigates a town wide curfew. Ghostface appears at the party and his first kill is a creative one, he uses a garage to break someones neck. While Sidney is being romantic with her boyfriend upstairs, the rest of them are watching the horror movies downstairs, this is when we are introduced to the rules of how to survive a horror movie. They also get a call about the headmaster being found dead, this is a smart little plot device to get rid of the excess people in the house, shows how morbid those people are but it is believable. From there on it is just different ways to kill all of the different people. But it then turns out that Billy is the killer, who faked his death, but he's not the only killer, the twist is that there are two killers Billy and Stuart. But as expected they die in the end and Sidney lives on to do sequels. Acting The acting of the main characters is solid, Neve Campbell plays the surviving Sidney, she adds a sense of reality to the main character who seems shy mostly. Skeet Ulrich plays Billy the brains of the murders, apart from mistaking him for Leonardo Dicaprio several times due to the way he looks he was a great actor and adds an unnerving sense of psycho into it. The secondary characters are good and actually feel like typical teenagers for the most part, apart from that there isn't really all too much to say about it, I admire that the movie didn't take itself all that seriously and that they were able to avoid being really cheesy at scenes that could have been cheesy. Noticeable Camera work The panning and tilting shots were used effectively, wasn't to keen on the times where the camera jump zoomed, these were rare but still noticeable. We were treated to voyeuristic shots as well which worked well for the overall feel along with being a plot device. Costume Not much to say about the costume, sort of inventive. Not much else. Length 110 minutes Overall Feel I enjoyed this movie overall, I was bored by the romantic scenes between Sidney and Billy after the first time we were introduced. The rest of the film created a dramatic and tense atmosphere, but when it cut to the romance I felt the suspense drop and was actually wishing them for to hurry up and get stabbed so we could go back to the main group watching movies downstairs.

Wells' War of the Worlds _ and I watch it ever time I can _ I am reminded of its Rosetta Stone, as it were Orson Welles' infamous Halloween Eve 1938 broadcast that panicked America. The film captures the furious pace and nightmarish fears that both Welles and George Pal understood so well. It was that rare transferral of the imagined to the Technicolor reality. To that end, I find it amusing to recall how Welles' original script, produced by his Mercury theatre on the Air, came about. Th following is a piece I wrote about that deceptively simple occurrence. I hope you enjoy it _ and that it enhances your viewing pleasure the next time you watch the movie.\/Gj)WITH WRITER HOWARD KOCH His 'War of the Worlds' Radio Script Panicked America On Oct. 30, 1938, Orson Welles' Mercury Theatre on the Air broadcast an adaptation of H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds -- that presentation has gone down as the most famous (or infamous) radio program of all time. Of the six million who listened, 1.2 million thought they were really listening to news reports of aliens landing in an attempt to take over humankind. Word spread fast, and that night became known as the night that panicked America. Howard Koch -- who wrote the script for that show in only six days -- told me in an interview a half- century later that he had been blissfully ignorant of what was happening. He had gone home to listen to the broadcast, and fallen asleep. He slumbered on even as co-producer John Houseman tried to call him to ask that he preserve his copy of the script because the police had seized all the others. The next morning, an unaware Koch awoke, wondering what to do on his day off. I lived on (New York's) 72nd Street, west side, and I was walking down the street to get a haircut. As I went along I heard people talking about 'invasion' and 'war,' and I thought Hitler had made a move. I rushed into the barbershop and said to the barber, 'Are we at war or something?' He laughed and held up the newspaper headline 'Martian Invasion Panics Nation.' I can tell you it was a strange moment in my life. To tell you the truth, I didn't know how to feel.'

In an interview on Dec. 3, 1987, Jules J. Epstein -- one of the three credited writers on the film -- said even he was uncertain To tell you the truth, it's almost impossible to tell who wrote what now. I read somewhere that (producer) Hal Wallis said he wrote the movie's last line -- when Bogart says to Claude Rains (a Vichy minion who helped Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid's characters escape the Nazis) 'I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.' And that could be. We originally had Rains saying that line, then Bogart finishing with, Yeah, but don't forget you owe me 10,000 francs.' We writers thought that last was more typical of him, but it was changed and it may have been Hal who changed it. At the time there was much confusion because the studio had a deadline -- 52 films were released each year, and this was just one of them. We were like any other film -- we took 30 days to film, maybe a couple of days more, and that was it. Jules Epstein, his brother Philip and Howard Koch won screen writing Oscars for their work on the film, which also earned Academy Awards for best picture and best director (Michael Curtiz). Said Koch in a separate interview Looking back, the picture seemed to have a life of its own. Whatever happened to it seemed to be for the good. I had an almost mystical feel to it. Jules Epstein and Koch said two endings were considered. The first -- and the one that was used -- had Bergman flying to Lisbon with her husband (Henreid), leaving Bogart behind. The second had her staying with Bogart. Contrary to Hollywood legend, only the first ending was actually shot. Bergman was the one who was worried about which ending we would use, Epstein said. It didn't bother Bogart -- nobody looked at it as a classic film, and he made four or five pictures a year anyway. Bergman came up to us on the set and asked, 'How can I play love scenes without knowing which man I end up with? Which one will it be?' And we told her, 'As soon as we know, we'll let you know.' In yet another interview Henreid said he knew all along what no one else knew -- that, under terms of his contract, he had to wind up with Bergman, something which even the writers didn't know. There were no two ways about it, Henreid said. That was written in the contract and signed by Warner Brothers. You musn't forget, they were very unsure of Bogart at that point. The film that brought him 'Casablanca' was 'High Sierra,' and the star of 'High Sierra' was not Bogart -- it was Ida Lupino.

The second had her staying with Bogart. Contrary to Hollywood legend, only the first ending was actually shot. Bergman was the one who was worried about which ending we would use, Epstein said. It didn't bother Bogart -- nobody looked at it as a classic film, and he made four or five pictures a year anyway. Bergman came up to us on the set and asked, 'How can I play love scenes without knowing which man I end up with? Which one will it be?' And we told her, 'As soon as we know, we'll let you know.' In yet another interview Henreid said he knew all along what no one else knew -- that, under terms of his contract, he had to wind up with Bergman, something which even the writers didn't know. There were no two ways about it, Henreid said. That was written in the contract and signed by Warner Brothers. You musn't forget, they were very unsure of Bogart at that point.

The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.YOU MUST REMEMBER THIS CASABLANCA made its debut on Nov. 26, 1942, at New York's Hollywood Theater. Shooting had begun on May 25th of that same year -- with an unfinished script. The myths over who wrote what, and when, have become as much of cinema lore as the film's plot itself. In an interview on Dec. 3, 1987, Jules J. Epstein -- one of the three credited writers on the film -- said even he was uncertain To tell you the truth, it's almost impossible to tell who wrote what now. I read somewhere that (producer) Hal Wallis said he wrote the movie's last line -- when Bogart says to Claude Rains (a Vichy minion who helped Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid's characters escape the Nazis) 'I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.' And that could be. We originally had Rains saying that line, then Bogart finishing with, Yeah, but don't forget you owe me 10,000 francs.' We writers thought that last was more typical of him, but it was changed and it may have been Hal who changed it. At the time there was much confusion because the studio had a deadline -- 52 films were released each year, and this was just one of them. We were like any other film -- we took 30 days to film, maybe a couple of days more, and that was it. Jules Epstein, his brother Philip and Howard Koch won screen writing Oscars for their work on the film, which also earned Academy Awards for best picture and best director (Michael Curtiz). Said Koch in a separate interview Looking back, the picture seemed to have a life of its own. Whatever happened to it seemed to be for the good. I had an almost mystical feel to it.

This is until the sewer erupts with sulfur gas, this can be seen as the bright yellow gas. This scene also shows us a rejected origin for Batman's villain Two Face. Which I suspect was the humorous inside joke as Tommy Lee Jones played Two Face 2 years before in Batman Forever. Mike Roark played by Tommy Lee Jones goes to find out what happened to the workers as part of his job, he wants to close down part of the subway which connects to the sewer to look into it further, but the other don't think that it is that big of a deal. This is a people don't believe the hero cliché. When Mike is with Dr Barnes, you will see him become more stupid, the first example being when she was talking about about geological events, and he didn't know what they were. Dr Barnes is told by Mike that it is too dangerous to go down there, so she goes down there with her friend anyway when it is dawn. The two scientists go down into the sewer to look for themselves, they find sulphur coving the walls along with other elements. The expendable one finds the crack and kneels right over it while collecting the sample from it. You now see why she is the expendable one. In a town 66 miles away from LA an earthquake occurs, this causes a blackout. The crack opens up and eats the expendable scientist. The Smarter scientist then looks down into this crack which just killed her friend... Just as Mike is taking his daughter to a safe place the pressure reaches it's underground limit and blows off all the man hole covers and the tar pits shoot out fire balls. You will also see that there are several helicopters in the air during this movie, this is a fact that Dante's Peak got correct, you don't fly anything near ash as it clogs up the air intake and causes the helicopter to crash. Lava comes up from the tar pits as Mike tries to help the fire fighters. Mike's daughter sees the lava and gets out of the car like a normal person would do, finally a child actor who isn't completely stupid and requires the parent to save them from a situation which they could save themselves from. Oh wait.. Nevermind. So Mike has leave the trapped fire fighter to save his daughter who could have easily saved herself and another fire fighter goes to help the firefighter only to cause both of them to die... But the other firefighter should have broken the front window instead of trying to crawl on top of it and pulling the guy out. Mike has to jump off his car as the magma is surrounding it, that magma is around 700ºC to 1300ºC, he should be dead from hyperthermia. And before you even think of saying its not cold, hyper is heat, hypo is cold. Even with fire proximity suits getting within single digits of feet is risky. Mike finally does the smart thing and sends her off to the hospital with the doctor, with her begging to stay. Dr Barnes arrives at scene and says You would have loved this Rachael I can understand the meaning behind it but.. People are dying and everything is on fire, do you think she would have loved this? They then have the idea to put a bus in front of it, this idea doesn't make any logically sense. They call in concrete blocks to try and stop the lava, it does stop the lava some how. In the real world this would not be the case, the lava would eat through the concrete within seconds, the paint on the fire trucks behind the the concrete would melt off as well being that close to extreme heat. They then find out the lava is traveling through the tunnels and is heading to the area where the hospital is, so then they have to organize a demolition of a building to make sure the lava goes into the ocean instead of the hospital. End of movie.Acting I feel like Tommy Lee Jones was only brought into the movie because he was a big name, he did a good performance. But you could put many other actors in his place and it would still be the same Anne Heche as the same to an extent, she provides good performance throughout the movie, but still feel slightly bland due to the script Emit Reese is Tommy Lee Jones's black friend, that is the only way to describe him Everyone else was decent to say the most in their roles, they didn't stand out to me but they weren't bad actors to its good. Noticeable Camera work Nothing special, there are a few shot which are nice such as looking into the sewer tunnel, where the dolly rolls forward and pans down. The framing of shots was good, but that was it there were barely any impressive camera angles throughout the movie and the ones that were good were so brief you'd miss them if you weren't paying attention. Graphics The CGI lava was decent and that was the only piece of computer graphics there is Overall Feel This movie has so many factual and continuity errors it is unbelievable, the musical score is subtle in most scenes, but in the scenes where it is noticed it is good. The whole movie sadly feels too long, we got the lava 30 minutes in and after a couple of minutes it got boring, Dante's Peak did a better job at keeping the volcano and lava interesting as it only showed it at the end of the movie.
