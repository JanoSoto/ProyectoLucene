And out of all the civil war movies produced, only one truly shows this to it's full extent.This is my review on Gettysberg.The plot goes like this; It's July 1863, halfway though the American civil war. The leader of the Confederates, Robert E Lee, launches a attack on the little town of Gettysberg. Little did both sides know that it was going to be the most ghastly battles ever to be raged on American soil.The American civil war is one of my favourite topics in history. There is just so much political intrigue between the to sides of the war. Both sides had very good reasons to grab a gun a fight for their country. Conferderates wanted Slavery and felt that the union, who wanted to end slavery, was taking away a major part of their economy. The union thought slavery was completely inhuman. In a way, this topic is depressing because they weren't fighting against another country that they could join together and fight. This war pitted friends, brothers and loved ones against each other, sometimes unwillingly. America was on the brink of collapse.Onto the movie. the movie centres around the topic mentioned above but delves deep into it. However, unlike most civil war movies, Gettysberg shows both sides of the story, highlighting every reason for fighting. In my opinion, they couldn't have done it better as you feel for every character in the film. every loss in battle makes you cringe. Wiether your loyal to the union or the confederacy, you are going to feel for each individual character.The acting is top notch for a film like this. Jeff Daniels takes centre stage on the union side, staring as Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain. His performance is definitely memorable as he recites many of the films great speeches and delivers the best performance of his career. Other people that stood out were Martin Sheen, Stephen Lang and Tom Berenger. Each and every performance was heart felt and they all seemed to enjoy every minute of their performances, even when their characters are suffering loss. The tone of the film is fantastic. It's start6s off a bit slow developing the characters back stories but once the battles take place, you really start to get the feeling the director is trying to get across. All the scenes before battles sometimes feel a bit meaningless, but most show the true depressing fact that all the soldiers don't want to fight, they just want what's good for their state and country. One thing this film does brilliantly is the relationship between two of the characters. Both play Generals on both sides of the war. They both long to see each other again before the battle proceeds but fear that they might not make it out alive. This is where the film shines and it portrays one of the best friendships in the history of film. The action scenes are also fantastic. Each scene, including the huge main battle at the end, begin with a huge battle plan which is interesting to see them establish. History\/military fans will enjoy each and every moment. The body count is huge with thousands of human bodies on screen at one time and it works to the film's advantage, making it feel huge.In conclusion, you probably know how I feel about the movie. It is VERY long and it could have been cut down a bit as there seems to be a lot of fill, but I'm not going to mark the film down for that. I say if you like history and the military see this film. Many may find this film boring and I would see where they are coming from but this film is right up my street. Im giving it a solid 10\/10.

Now to begin, I was never expecting solid, performances or an Oscar winning role, but for what it was i just couldn't feel much more than, these people will eventually die (basic horror logic) and to be honest i'm not that bothered about it either,and that to me is down to a poorly written script or down down to bad casting, but none the less, i felt No sympathy for any of them, apart from the only believable character, to which i could believe is the point, and this would be ash; who was a bit more three dimensional and stood out more than the others, rather than using clichéd horror thinking and doing stupid s**t (ignoring the basement scene). Now putting acting aside and looking at it for what it was it was otherwise pretty good; one thing things I especially loved was the score that was pieced to each and every scene, it really gives the film that horror edge and makes you quiver with fear, even if there is nothing particularly haunting happening in that given time; pretty much that I know somethings going to happen but when; and the score builds this up perfectly for say when two arms smash through a door. another thing that I though was absolutely great in this film was the special effects, oh how I miss the simpler films, where things can look better than CGI and at the same time not be spending wad loads of cash on it; going back to the special effects, the make up for the zombified humans was disturbingly frightening, especially Cheryl and creepy ass laugh. the ending scene with the melting corpses clearly made out of plaster scene (or clay for the Americans) was so cool, and because it looked like it had that skin like texture, it made it seem more like it was melting than if it was being done nowadays in CGI, thing is to me, is that realism can ruin things like that and thats why this film is very entertaining for the genre that it is. however another small gripe I have is the way the film is shot, the camera annoys the hell out of me, reminds me of home videos that have been shot by a budding film maker in his teens.

The problem (From the POW point of view) is a lack of discipline. The way that Animial and Blondie conducted themselves would not be tolerated according to any kind of military code you can possibly think of. This goes back to Duke (Neville Brand) who as barracks head, is responsible. The exception to this is of course, Sefton (William Holden), who although out for himself, is always neat, and organized. This kind of lose atmosphere makes it easy for the Germans (Or any other enemy) to slip a mole into the camp. Spoilers The reason I like Sefton is he is smart. He knows that he does not really have a chance of escape, and will wait out the rest of the war (If necessary). In particular he is smart not befriending anyone except Cookie (Gil Stratton), who the film is shown through the eyes of. There is an old NAVY adage, Loose Lips Sink Ships and there are always informants (If not outright moles) in almost every kind of prison environment, so Sefton's strategy is correct. It basically is survival for Sefton, until he is suspected of being a traitor by the camp(Two POWs were killed by the Germans), and he is given a Blanket Party by his fellow POW's and beaten up bad. He realizes his strategy of deal making and having fun with Russian Women will end, and he has to uncover the traitor or he will get killed. His opportunity comes, when Lt. James Dunbar (Don Taylor) is snatched out of the Commandant Von Scherbach's (Otto Preminger) office, and Von Scherbach needs to contact the mole in order to find out where he is. What happens is a phony air raid warning is given and the men are ordered out of the barracks, and Sgt. Schultz (Sig Ruman) meets with the mole who turns out to be Sgt. Price (Peter Graves), who runs security. They set up a system where Price signals Schultz by tying the cord on the light, and the air raid warning comes, and he sends notes to Von Scherbach via a chess piece. This time however, who is hiding in the shadows but Sefton who now knows the truth. But the key is proving it. What happens is the POW's have to hide Dunbar (It turned out to be in the water tower), and Price was going to be involved, but Sefton demanded to be guarded my security, so if something bad happens, they don't have a patsy. Thus Price has no idea where Dunbar is. At the end of the film, the plan is to smuggle Dunbar out of the camp, and Price volunteers to do it. Everyone agreed except Sefton says that Duke already turned over Dunbar to the Germans, and Duke says how he had to keep everyone off of Sefton, but keep his mouth shut. Sefton then starts to interrogate Price and asks him when did the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor, Price says December 7th. Sefton asks What were you doing? Price said Eating Dinner. Sefton Eating Dinner in Berlin. Price said That means nothing, you are not listing to him are you? Duke says I want to hear what he has to say. Sefton then searches Price, and finds the chess piece, and has the proof he needs. Sefton then comes up with a plan about how to get Dunbar out of the tower, and the camp, which is to use Price as a decoy, throw him out in the yard, while Sefton takes Dunbar out. Duke is reluctant but Sefton points out It is Price or Dunbar, its up to you?, and Animal says if we kill him they can retaliate and if he is freed, he can be placed in another POW Camp, but if the Germans do it, nothing can happen to us. They agree to do it, and Price gets shot, and Von Scherbach has an evil smirk on his face, until he sees who got killed, as this occurs, Sefton and Dunbar get away. Much is made of the smile on Sefton's face when he said goodbye to the Camp, showing he is not the total hard ass as he seemed to be, but keep in mind, that he brought Dunbar with him, so he was a hero. What is unsaid but you know will happen is Von Scherbach and Schultz will pay for what happened to Price (The Reich did not tolerate failure) and will end up at the Russian Front or before a Court Martial. Note Both were extremely deserving of this, in particular, Von Scherbach with his abuse of prisoners (In Nazi Germany itself, Field Marshal Hermann Goering would not approve of those actions (The Luftwaffe ran the POW Camps and he respected POW's, unlike the Gestapo, and what they did to Jews and other enemies of the state). Finally, I cannot believe anyone who has seen this film can give it less then 10\/10 stars. It is an absolute classic.

The plot doesn't go anywhere; it sits there and watches as the film's comedy takes the wheel.The film is definitely intended to bring up laughter, but I'm not sure if it's sole purpose of production was to be a comedy.

The humor is very similar to that of the first film, only, like this film's story, never jumps to the point of surpassing anything we've already seen.However, despite these flaws, the film was overall enjoyable. There's not much you'd miss if you skip this one, but if you enjoyed Every Which Way but Loose, you're probably going to like Any Which Way You Can - just probably not as much as you enjoyed the first.

Clint Eastwood's performance may feel a bit weaker or equal to his in Every Which Way but Loose, but it definitely adds to the experience.Overall, a good film to see if you really enjoyed the first. The two films are very similar, so much so that if you stumbled upon one on television, it may take you awhile to figure out which one you're watching.

Even 30 years after its initial release you can still feel its influence in most science fiction films to this day. The story is adapted from Philp Dick's novel Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep and it is a very loose adaptation with events and characters from the novel either changed or omitted but the film takes a creative approach to the novel giving it an art-house feel. Unfortunately most modern audiences who haven't read the book or seen the movie for the first time might be bored by its slow pacing and lack of action since it was advertised as a sci-fi action film.In order to appreciate this film you have to understand the time period in which it was released. Back in the 80s sci-fi was at its peak with releases such as The Empire Strikes Back, Star Trek The Wrath of Khan, and E.T which were all box office hits at the movies with their fantasy and adventure approaches to their stories. Blade Runner on the other hand had a more unique approach with its dark and depressing depiction of the future L.A., pollution, overpopulation and Eastern culture influences with a touch of noir mixed with philosophy, a noir narration spoken by Harrison Ford and an atmospheric soundtrack by Vangelis. Not to mention Ford playing a dark anti-hero role rather than the big screen hero role that most audiences associated him with. All this led to its failure at the box office and it wouldn't be heard from again until its revival in 1993 with the release of a directors cut which the director Ridley Scott was not involved that omitted the narration and changed the ending which led to its popularity with cult audiences. In 2007 Ridley Scott returned to Blade Runner and added some clean up to the movie, added a few extra scenes and minimal CG to create his definitive edition of Blade Runner.The performances in this movie are great with Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer as the standouts. The production and setting design is well done giving it a great and unique noir atmosphere which has been highly influential in most science fiction movies since then. And the action scenes are great and intense even emotional at times. As for story its both hit and miss. Its got a great and thought provoking premise and a great setting to put it in but some of the characters are underdeveloped but maybe they are supposed to be that way because of the ideas that the movie presents to the viewer of the differences between emotional man and unemotional synthetic human and what it means to be human.Its a great movie but not for casual audiences who want fast paced action and adventure. Since there are multiple versions of the movie go for the Final Cut for the better experience. 9 out of 10 stars. Despite this films flaws. I never get bored with this film no matter how many times I watch it. It's that good but thats just me. You have to figure out for yourself if this is a great film or not.

Those from this current generation (1981 and beyond, myself included) will be simply in awe and, if one were to recall this from their childhood (who from this time period hasn't seen this?) they may even shed a few tears.I did and I'm not afraid to admit it. The Lion King is a dashingly fierce achievement from Disney, one with gripping scenes of delight and uncompromising beauty and charm. Its songs seem more than just standard Disney archetypes, but those of true power and importance, especially Hakuna Matata and Circle of Life, the opening ballad.The story concerns Simba, a feisty cub whose parents, Mufasa and Sarabi, carry a very respected reputation throughout the land. Mufasa is the king of the jungle and Simba can't wait to be king, and for that reason, is always getting into some sort of trouble. Mufasa's brother, Scar, is jealous and holds an incredible disdain for his brother and Simba. When Simba gets himself into big trouble, causing a wild stampede of hyenas (which, by the way, is just breathtakingly slick and stylish), Mufasa is killed by Scar, when trying to rescue Simba. Scar makes Simba feel as if he was responsible for the death of his father and implores him to run away.So he does, and Scar takes the throne in no time, running the Pride Lands into the ground and completely ruining the consistency and order Mufasa took so long to build.Upon running away, Simba meets up with Timon, a meerkat, and Pumba, a warthog in the jungle, the mighty jungle. They teach the naive little cub how to thrive in the jungle, and fast-forward a few years, and Simba is older, stronger, even feistier than before, and with a full grown mane.The Lion King collectively merges the classic Shakespearean story of Hamlet with the divine simplicity and the walk on the other side of the road formula of their 1967 hit Jungle Book into a true achievement in every category. There's a beautiful thing about the way the film conceives emotions and builds on locations. From the first frame to the last, it is littered with evocative landscapes, some of which are hard to believe they're only hand-drawn, pre-CGI work. The use of lighting and darkness can be vaguely called animation noir before it became a real standard, with the sunlit landscapes of the Pride Lands and the excellent use of darkness when it came to showcasing the Scar character, is truly masterful and beyond words.It is also interesting to note that The Lion King sort of kicks off Disney's dare to be different phase that it maintained well into the 2000's with films like Atlantis The Lost Empire and Lilo and Stitch truly pushing what the company can really do. The Lion King's story, mainly centered around guilt, power, and redemption, is a lot darker with only occasional touches of humor breaking through the melancholic presence of the story. The youngsters may have a hard time coping. I know if I saw this any younger than six it would've been uncomfortable. Though it seems that with the abundance of re-releases the film is getting, the story appeals to those of all ages.NOTE It's a shame that Disney has stooped to the level of manipulation and tampering with this grandiose animated achievement. To see it get a 3D re-release and multiple re-releases on DVD just to become lucrative for the company, also equipped with a surcharge, is somewhat heartbreaking.Voiced by Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Moira Kelly, Nathan Lane, Ernie Sabella, and Rowan Atkinson.

I first saw this delightful, Jules Verne-inspired little animated film from the co-directing team of Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise (with producer Don Hahn) - who were behind Disney's animated renaissance favorite Beauty and the Beast (1991) - when it came to DVD in early 2002.Having watched the film today for the first time in ages, I was again awe-struck by the lush beauty of its visuals (which seemed to have mimicked the style of Japanese Anime' and American Hellboy comic book artist Mike Mignola), its highly evocative musical score (by James Newton Howard), and its beautiful aquatic imagery; I have a thing for water, the ocean and aquatic imagery\/visuals, so Atlantis The Lost Empire was right up my alley.

As you might expect, the story concerns the search for the lost continent of Atlantis of ancient folklore\/legends (particulary those as described by Plato and the famed clairvoyant Edgar Cayce), which was befallen by a great cataclysmic event that caused it to disappear beneath the surface of the ocean centuries ago. Opening in 1914, Milo Thatch (voiced by Michael J. Fox, one of my all-time favorite and inspirational actors) is a young linguist\/cartographer trying to get funding for an expedition to find the Lost Continent.Shunned by his colleagues but spurned on by the cherished memories of his late adventurer-grandfather, the enthusiastic young explorer finds unexpected financial backing from the mysterious rich benefactor Preston J. Whitmore (John Mahoney) who puts him on an expedition to find Atlantis. The operation is led by Commander Rourke (James Garner) and his second-in-command Helga Sinclair (Claudia Christian), and others include ex-Army physician Dr. Joshua Sweet (Phil Morris), French geologist Gaetan The Mole Moliere (Corey Burton), Italian demolitions expert Vinny Santorini (Don Novello), feisty teenage Latina mechanic Audrey Ramirez (Jacqueline Obradors), chain-smoking radio operator Mrs. Packard (Florence Stanley), and chef Cookie (the late Jim Varney).They eventually find the underwater kingdom, only to discover that there is an entire civilization of people thriving there, led by King Nedakh (Leonard Nimoy) and his beautiful daughter Kida (Cree Summers). The Atlantean people are highly advanced technologically, and have their own thriving native language (developed for the film by linguist Mark Okrand) and thoroughly self-contained mythology.Thinking about the film, I remember that much of the story and imagery in Atlantis The Lost Empire still remains remarkably fresh in my mind; I find that to be one of the strongest hallmarks of any animated feature. That Disney was able to make me care so much about the characters and story says as much about its overall entertainment value. Additionally, the all-star cast of first-rate voice actors make the proceedings even more enjoyable; I'm also glad that there were no songs here, either, and that it was a straight-forward science fiction\/adventure movie, and a rather thrilling and intelligent one, at that.I find Atlantis The Lost Empire to be a beautifully animated Disney feature, oft-over-looked but hopefully never forgotten by the masses of animation fans out there.

Both deal with a similar poor girl loves rich boy storyline which ends tragically, although the nature of the tragedy is different in the two films. As one might expect, the later film is more sexually explicit, although not as explicit as it might have been had it been made later in the decade. In 1961 the Production Code was still in effect, so although there is a lot of talk about sex, there are no actual sex scenes.The film is set in the Kansas of the late 1920s. The main characters are two teenage lovers, Deanie Loomis and Bud Stamper. Bud is the son of the wealthiest family in the area, his father having made a fortune from the oil business, whereas Deanie is from a lower-middle-class background. The story can be seen as a study of the sexual attitudes of the period. The older generation divides women into two types, nice girls and bad girls. The essential characteristic of a nice girl seems to be total asexuality; she has no desire for sex before marriage and even after marriage only gives in to her husband's desires in order to produce children. Young men wishing to engage in pre-marital sex are advised to find a bad girl for the purpose. Men, however, will never marry a bad girl because in their hearts they do not respect sexually active women; only nice girls have any chance of getting married. The scriptwriter William Inge seems to have regarded these attitudes as being those of an unenlightened older generation, but they probably still persisted in some quarters in the early sixties. Indeed, despite the so-called sexual revolution they, in some quarters, persisted during my own teenage years in the seventies and eighties.Deanie is desperately in love with Bud, and wants to have sex with him, but reluctantly follows her mother's advice that the only way to win his heart is to remain a virgin and thereby ensure his continued respect for her. Bud's father, Ace, does not want him to marry Deanie, whose family he regards as insufficiently elevated, but is cunning enough not to say so directly. He consents to Bud becoming engaged to Deanie, but warns him that marriage will have to wait until Bud has completed his studies at Yale University. In the meantime, he can find a bad girl with whom he can satisfy his sexual desires. Bud does not really want to go to university- he has set his heart on a career in farming- but reluctantly accedes to his father's wishes. His relationship with Deanie breaks down, and after further misadventures she is hospitalised with depression. Another theme in the film is the Crash of '29 and the subsequent Great Depression.Inge's title is taken from Wordsworth's Immortality Ode, a poem which plays an important role in the drama. Deanie is asked to explain Wordsworth's lines at school and explains that the poem is about the way in which youthful idealism dies and is replaced by a more mature but harder adult realism, and this is what we see happening to Deanie and Bud; their youthful dreams die and they end the film disillusioned and yet perhaps wiser.The leading characters are played by a sweetly innocent Natalie Wood and the young Warren Beatty in his screen debut. Both acquit themselves well, especially Wood, and although they were in their early twenties rather than their teens they do not, unlike many twenty-something actors called upon to play high school students, appear too old for their roles.And yet this was not a film which I greatly enjoyed. None of the other actors were as impressive; Pat Hingle as Ace, in particular, seemed to be overacting. Inge may have intended his script as an indictment of unenlightened attitudes towards sexuality, but a whiff of fifties moralism still hangs in the air. An example is in the treatment of Bud's sister Ginny (played by Barbara Loden, wife of the director Elia Kazan). Ginny is what in the twenties would have been called a flapper or modern girl; she smokes, drinks, is sexually promiscuous and has even had an abortion. Had this film been made a few years later, Ginny would probably have been a major character, an early example of sexual liberation, but as things are she is treated less as a character in her won right than as a symbol, the ultimate bad girl and an awful warning to Deanie of the dire fate that awaits her should she give in to her sexual desires. Ginny plays a relatively large part in the first half of the film, but then fades out.In its sexual themes Splendor in the Grass has something in common with the cycle of films based on the plays of Tennessee Williams which were so popular with film-makers in the fifties and sixties. (One of the best of these, A Streetcar Named Desire, was also directed by Kazan). Yet Williams' plays, although often overwrought and hysterical, at least have a vigour which is largely lacking from Inge's gloomy rural melodrama. Kazan is never able to bring the story to life in the way he brought Streetcar to life. The film is only just over two hours in length, but seems longer, and the storyline, at first compelling, breaks down and becomes muddled and confusing about halfway through. The second half, especially in the scenes of Deanie in the hospital, becomes dull and lacking in vitality. That Inge won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay ahead of the writers of the masterly Ballad of a Soldier can only be explained by a Cold War reluctance on the part of the Academy to hand out Oscars to Soviet citizens. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 August 2012","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Splendor in the Grass is a romantic drama with certain similarities to A Place in the Sun from ten years earlier.

Bud's father, Ace, does not want him to marry Deanie, whose family he regards as insufficiently elevated, but is cunning enough not to say so directly. He consents to Bud becoming engaged to Deanie, but warns him that marriage will have to wait until Bud has completed his studies at Yale University. In the meantime, he can find a bad girl with whom he can satisfy his sexual desires. Bud does not really want to go to university- he has set his heart on a career in farming- but reluctantly accedes to his father's wishes. His relationship with Deanie breaks down, and after further misadventures she is hospitalised with depression. Another theme in the film is the Crash of '29 and the subsequent Great Depression.Inge's title is taken from Wordsworth's Immortality Ode, a poem which plays an important role in the drama. Deanie is asked to explain Wordsworth's lines at school and explains that the poem is about the way in which youthful idealism dies and is replaced by a more mature but harder adult realism, and this is what we see happening to Deanie and Bud; their youthful dreams die and they end the film disillusioned and yet perhaps wiser.The leading characters are played by a sweetly innocent Natalie Wood and the young Warren Beatty in his screen debut. Both acquit themselves well, especially Wood, and although they were in their early twenties rather than their teens they do not, unlike many twenty-something actors called upon to play high school students, appear too old for their roles.And yet this was not a film which I greatly enjoyed. None of the other actors were as impressive; Pat Hingle as Ace, in particular, seemed to be overacting. Inge may have intended his script as an indictment of unenlightened attitudes towards sexuality, but a whiff of fifties moralism still hangs in the air. An example is in the treatment of Bud's sister Ginny (played by Barbara Loden, wife of the director Elia Kazan). Ginny is what in the twenties would have been called a flapper or modern girl; she smokes, drinks, is sexually promiscuous and has even had an abortion. Had this film been made a few years later, Ginny would probably have been a major character, an early example of sexual liberation, but as things are she is treated less as a character in her won right than as a symbol, the ultimate bad girl and an awful warning to Deanie of the dire fate that awaits her should she give in to her sexual desires. Ginny plays a relatively large part in the first half of the film, but then fades out.In its sexual themes Splendor in the Grass has something in common with the cycle of films based on the plays of Tennessee Williams which were so popular with film-makers in the fifties and sixties. (One of the best of these, A Streetcar Named Desire, was also directed by Kazan). Yet Williams' plays, although often overwrought and hysterical, at least have a vigour which is largely lacking from Inge's gloomy rural melodrama. Kazan is never able to bring the story to life in the way he brought Streetcar to life. The film is only just over two hours in length, but seems longer, and the storyline, at first compelling, breaks down and becomes muddled and confusing about halfway through. The second half, especially in the scenes of Deanie in the hospital, becomes dull and lacking in vitality. That Inge won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay ahead of the writers of the masterly Ballad of a Soldier can only be explained by a Cold War reluctance on the part of the Academy to hand out Oscars to Soviet citizens. 5\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"14 August 2012","score":"","review":" They do not make movies like this anymore. All the technology and special effects have been almost a problem if you ask me. The plot was very well written, the acting was great. The house is spooky. There is nothing cheesy about the movie. There also are no cliché's. No cats jumping out when the music gets intense or any cheesy stuff like that. The music is also pretty chilling.If you turn the lights out, grab your significant other, maybe have a couple friends over, be quiet and just watch the movie, you are in for a treat. The séance is spooky. Just the whole movie is so well done! This movie rates in my top 5 of all time for sure. I wish movies did not get lost in all the special effects now days. I like older movies generally. They did not have the special effects to rely on so they did it the old fashioned way, a good, clever plot.The good thing about this movie is that while it is scary, it is not evil. The séance pushes it, and I choose not to watch that scene, but it is not like an excorcist movie or anything like that.I won't say much about the plot, you can read that on the website, I will just say that this movie is one of the best of all time.

The only addition in the Director's Cut is about 90 seconds of additional on-screen violence.)1997's New Line Cinema release Spawn is based loosely on Todd MacFarlane's groundbreaking, violent comic book of the same name. Following a hero who died and was returned to Earth following a deal with a devil-like being, the film is a fundamental mess with enough style, creativity and cool visuals to make it worth watching once for fans of action and of fantasy.Michael Jai White plays Al Simmons, a military commando and assassin working for Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen), his commander who betrays him on his final mission. Wynn and his associate Jessica (Melinda Clarke) shoot Simmons, crippling him, and set him ablaze, leaving him to perish in a chemical-weapons factory in North Korea. Simmons is sent to hell for his violent past where he meets Malebolgia, the sort-of devil-like figure that rules hell. Simmons will be returned to Earth so he can see his finance Wanda once again (played by Theresa Randle) in exchange for training to lead Malebolgia's growing army of damned souls in a war against the light.Back on Earth, Simmons is discovered and trained by the evil beast Clown (John Leguizamo), an agent of Hell. Simmons' body grows an organic Necro-flesh body of armor and Simmons becomes a Hellspawn, plotting to use his newfound powers to seek revenge on Wynn. However after some dramatic events, Simmons\/Spawn eventually realizes the error of his ways, and decides to use his organic armor and newfound hell-powers to fight evil and try to stop Malebolgia's plans.The acting is halfway decent. White plays Simmons well, although the character is never given much development. He's perpetually angry and in a state of mental imbalance, so he's just sort of in revenge-mode the whole film, speaking low and menacingly. Still, White does a great job. Sheen is actually a lot of fun as the villainous Wynn. Leguizamo is the standout performance here, though. He makes Clown hilarious and threatening, especially once we realize just how powerful he is (with an ability to transform into a monster seemingly inspired by HR Giger called The Violator). Other roles played by actors like Theresa Randale and DB Sweeney are well-played but fleshed out even less than our lead character.The production is a bit lacking, however. Director Mark AZ Dippe never quite is able to find the right balance for the story, with scenes alternatingly too juvenile and humorous before suddenly becoming dark and oppressive. His camera-work and shot compositions are also often compelling, but it feels like he shot the movie on caffeine as they're often very quick and lack deliberation. Combined with some over- editing, the film is a bit wonky. Production design is actually quite cool, especially the alleyways where Simmons calls home, which are Gothic and reminded me of Burton's original Batman. The costume and creature designs, however, are top notch. Spawn's bio-armor is glorious and very cool, and creatures like the Violator are eerie and terrifying. The special effects are a mixed-bag for the 90's. Most of the effects involving Spawn and his armor are fantastic, and Violator is brilliantly realized, but other effects (including sequences in hell) look too much like 90's video games, with block-y creatures and some poor uses of pixel-y, 2D sprites for characters in the background.My major problems with this film fall into several big points.First and foremost, the film is just too quick. At barely more than 95 minutes, there isn't any time to get yourself involved with the story, especially with the break-neck pace. The inconsistent tone and some truly juvenile, unfunny humor also break the pacing a lot. A lot of pointless scenes feel thrown in (like Spawn encountering Satan- worshipping teens at a graveyard) and pointless. And at times, the film does feel a bit too much like a movie. It feels too manufactured and movie-like during key scenes, which was in part due to an inexperienced director and because of limitations of the time.Still, this isn't a terrible movie despite huge flaws. It's merely an OK movie. I give Spawn an average 5 out of 10. It's imaginative and has a lot of cool ideas and visuals, but it never feels complete or fully developed. Give it a rent.
