But then I realised that I was gradually being gripped harder and harder by this movie by Bjork's extraordinary performance, by the simple, inexorable story, by the cinematography in all its outrageous von Trier eccentricity. This film is definitely one of the best I have ever seen.It certainly deserves a Best Film nomination, though I doubt whether it will appeal to enough people for it to do so, but if Bjork doesn't get Best Actress for this performance there is no justice! I felt as if she *was* Selam (and that is NOT to say that Bjork was just 'being herself'; if you have ever seen Bjork perform, her persona as singer is quite, quite different from even the musical segments in this film).The 'realism' of the story shouldn't be your main criterion when watching this film. There are lots of points at which you could say, oh look, in reality that wouldn't happen. I don't think that's the point I think the film is like a *fable*, a simple tale, with a predictable ending. The point is not whether it's realistic or suspenseful, but what we learn from its telling. And the character of Selam has to be one of the most moving and inspirational characters you can find on screen.The cinematography I get a bit of a headache from the swoopy hand-held camera work, and could do with less of it, but I didn't think it was as pronounced as in Breaking The Waves, or the Michael Winterbottom film, Wonderland. What I loved was the contrast between the grey-yellow-beige tones of 'real life' and the glowing colours of the musical numbers. And the way that the images would slowly start to glow into bright colours as a prelude to the singing and dancing... Von Trier uses amazing camera angles to give dozens of different shots within the same scene, a device that's usually distancing, but here intensifies your response to every scene.And the musical numbers? I loved the unconventional music, the dippy lyrics, the eccentric choreography. No, it doesn't look like a normal musical, but that style of song and dance dervues from several decades ago now I think it's great that Von Trier bothered to think up *something different*. As for the filming of the musical segments, watch out especially for the first one, where everyone starts singing and dancing in the factory. There were 100 video cameras placed around the set, all simultaneously filming, and then the scene is constructed from editing those different shots. Brilliant stuff.When you go see this film, just be aware that it is pretty intense. You might hate it (some people walked out when I saw it), but you are more likely to be completely wrapped up in it, and thus find the ending harrowing.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Musical"},{"date":"16 October 2000","score":"","review":"  In this day and age, it's almost pointless to make a decision about what movie you want to see based on the theatrical trailer. Almost every trailer is a masterpiece of editing. A good editor could make Ishtar look like Lawrence of Arabia. The Beach is a good example of a completely misleading trailer -- not only does it make that piece of hackwork look like a great film, but it's also completely misleading about what the film is about.The trailer for Get Carter isn't misleading about the story, but it is misleading about how good the film is. The trailer for this film is brilliant. It's sets a new standard for trailers, it's a fantastic piece of filmmaking. And it's not like Get Carter is as bad as Ishtar or The Beach, but it's nowhere as good as we're led to believe. SPOILER ALERT The story...well, the story is actually a little confusing. Not on the surface on the surface, Carter (Stallone), a Vegas leg-breaker, comes home when his brother turns up dead, suspecting for really no good reason that he's been bumped off. He manages to p**s off about half the town asking questions, and manages to confuse the audience as to why exactly he thinks that his brother's been killed. Which he has, of course. Maybe Carter looked at the script.The script only gets more confusing. This is one of those films where there are a lot of different shady characters, all screwing each other for one reason or the other, and where there are a lot of different layers to peel away. The script does a terrible job keeping all these layers and characters straight, and the direction doesn't do much to help. I hate to evoke the ever-popular music video analogy, but this film is very stylistic just for the purpose of being stylistic. And don't get me wrong -- I love style, I love nifty camera angles, and I love creative editing. But this film takes it way too far, and actually makes it harder to follow the story, which wasn't so easy to follow in the first place.Really, the only thing this film has going for it is the cast, and fortunately, the film's got quite a bit going for it. This isn't Stallone's best performance (you'll have to see the brilliant Cop Land for that), but it's a damn good one. He plays the brooding, moody, dark, yet friendly Jack Carter with style to burn, and this is a case where style is a good thing. Stallone's great here, and brings a lot of personality to a pretty flat character. Mickey Rourke, Michael Caine, and Miranda Richardson are all great in strong supporting roles, but the person who really shines here is Rachel Leigh Cook. Even with the nasty little dreadlocks and the distracting nose ring she sports in this film, that girl is still charming as hell. She's attractive, sure, but there's much more to it than that. She just has this natural charm that shows up very clearly on screen, enchanting both the characters in the film and the members of the audience. Indeed, my attention to this film had been wandering somewhat, until it was revealed that Cook's character had been wronged in a very serious way. I was all of a sudden very involved in the film, wanting Carter to get the guys who had assaulted her. It took Cook's charm to get me emotionally involved in the film, and that's saying a lot, both about the script and about her charm.The action is also often ruined by the stylistic nature of the film. There's one great car chase -- no, car duel -- sequence, but that's about it. Everything else is really flat, or really convoluted.I also get the impression that a lot of stuff might have been cut out. There are a couple loose ends, and some fairly extraneous characters. Carter's in trouble with his boss in Vegas (who we never see completely) because he's poking around in his hometown. It seems to me that Carter's boss was really the mastermind behind the whole thing, especially since one of the characters -- who should have nothing to do with Carter's boss -- mentions him by name. But nothing more is made of that, and the situation with Carter's boss is just kinda sitting there, not doing anything except padding the film's running time. I guess I'm saying that the editing was also pretty bad -- they really needed to include more than they did, because the film as it stands is pretty confusing. They could have cut it down even more, I suppose, and eliminate those extraneous characters I mentioned, but there's still stuff that should have been included that wasn't. I don't know if it was filmed then cut, or written and not filmed, or if it just wasn't written at all. So I don't really know who to blame.If this review seems a little fractured, I suppose it's just my reaction to the film. Great movies bring out the best in my writing. Crappy ones do the opposite.Bottom line Confusing and way too stylistic, but the acting saves it from completely sucking. My grade C - My advice A damn, everything else has been rented kinda film.

Crappy ones do the opposite.Bottom line Confusing and way too stylistic, but the acting saves it from completely sucking. My grade C - My advice A damn, everything else has been rented kinda film.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"16 October 2000","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  **SPOILER ALERT** Two years ago, I was fortunate to see THE EXORCIST on the big screen at the Warner Bros. 75th Anniversary film festival. And watching it on the big screen made me change my opinion of the movie from weird to excellent.  I first saw EXORCIST when I was nine on late night television.  I couldn't make any sense of it, and I though it was very bizarre.  I saw it a few years later on video and thought it was so-so. But watching this on the big screen really makes a impact of the film.  And now, we are lucky to see THE EXORCIST on the big screen, and it is the uncut version. In case you never heard or saw THE EXORCIST, this is based on the popular novel by William Peter Blatty.  Blatty loosely based his story on a factual incident of a real exorcism during the 1940's.  Exorcism became a thing of the past since modern science discovered various mental illnesses including split personalities and insanity.  In the film famous film actress, Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) is noticing that day after day, her twelve year old daughter, Regan (Linda Blair) is acting more bizarre and scary.  From using constant profanities to even hitting her mother and doctors.  After going to several different doctors, Chris seeks the help from Father Karras (Jason Miller).  Father Karras is having problems of his own, he questions his own faith after being guilty over his mother's death in a mental institution.  When Father Karras discovers the horrors of the deamon that has taken over Regan's body he wishes to use a exorcism, a ancient ritual where a priest or rabbi drive the evil spirit out of a person's body.  But since Karras is inexperienced, he gets the help from the distinguished and experienced Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow).  While a police detective, Lieutenant Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb) is investigating the murder of film director Burke Dennings (Jack MacGowran). The original EXORCIST I think is one of the most frightening and scariest movies of all time.  Although it's not about a shark in water (which scares me the most) this is about a evil that lives amongst us.  Some people don't believe this, others strongly do.  This is a film that is different and better than the slasher flicks that are being released by the dozens. I am here to review the new and uncut version of the film, so here is what I enjoyed and didn't enjoy with the new version. LIKED  I enjoyed the new digital transfer, it was excellent!  I kept jumping as I heard the voice of the demon from behind me in the theater. It's rare that I can recognize the new digital transfer with classic being rereleased and digitally transferred. I also enjoyed some of the deleted scenes that were shown.  I found the best to be the first examination of Regan, where later on the doctor reveals to Chris that her daughter was using strong profanity towards him.  Unlike the original version where the terror just jumps out, it creeps up in this version.  I also enjoyed the more visions of the demon and the nice quiet dialogue scene where Father Merrin and Karras are discussing the evil they are up against.  DISLIKED  I did enjoy the visions of the demon, but on the windows?  And the doors?  It looks more comical that scary when I see those. Unless director William Fredkin and writer\/producer William Peter Blatty can come up with a good reason on why they did that, I won't accept it. But the biggest flaw is the end,  I am one who always enjoys a director's cut, THE ABYSS, ALIENS, and even the STAR WARS films redone were fantastic. But the final scene in the film where Lt. Kinderman and Father Dyer (Reverand William O'Malley) are talking about movies, takes away the errie and suspense of the original.  Where the original suddenly ended with the Jack Nitzsche Tublar Bells being played then...BOOM the credits.  It ends in a terrifying and creepy note.  But with this new ending, it's almost like a happy ending a ending that modern movie goers would enjoy.  I am a person that would always say, more is better.  But with this version, it ruins the film. This is a movie that I would find to be very scary.  It would be a great film to watch on Halloween night.  But what upset me while watching this film are the rude people who would laugh and find this movie to be funny.  Why?  What's so funny about a young girl spitting up pea soup?  I would be horrified and disgusted.  But the people who laugh at this film, are the kind that find a stupid teenager wearing a white hollow mask carrying a knife around killing teens, to be scary.  These imbeciles are the ones who find THE SIXTH SENSE to be stupid EVENT HORIZON to be weird but find SCREAM as the bomb and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID... as freaky.

I'll point my finger at the Hollywood director's who do countless rip-offs and spoofs of EXORCIST (Leslie Nielsen's REPOSSESSED and ABBY come to mind).

And watching it on the big screen made me change my opinion of the movie from weird to excellent.  I first saw EXORCIST when I was nine on late night television.  I couldn't make any sense of it, and I though it was very bizarre.  I saw it a few years later on video and thought it was so-so. But watching this on the big screen really makes a impact of the film.  And now, we are lucky to see THE EXORCIST on the big screen, and it is the uncut version. In case you never heard or saw THE EXORCIST, this is based on the popular novel by William Peter Blatty.  Blatty loosely based his story on a factual incident of a real exorcism during the 1940's.  Exorcism became a thing of the past since modern science discovered various mental illnesses including split personalities and insanity.  In the film famous film actress, Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) is noticing that day after day, her twelve year old daughter, Regan (Linda Blair) is acting more bizarre and scary.  From using constant profanities to even hitting her mother and doctors.  After going to several different doctors, Chris seeks the help from Father Karras (Jason Miller).  Father Karras is having problems of his own, he questions his own faith after being guilty over his mother's death in a mental institution.  When Father Karras discovers the horrors of the deamon that has taken over Regan's body he wishes to use a exorcism, a ancient ritual where a priest or rabbi drive the evil spirit out of a person's body.  But since Karras is inexperienced, he gets the help from the distinguished and experienced Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow).  While a police detective, Lieutenant Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb) is investigating the murder of film director Burke Dennings (Jack MacGowran). The original EXORCIST I think is one of the most frightening and scariest movies of all time.  Although it's not about a shark in water (which scares me the most) this is about a evil that lives amongst us.  Some people don't believe this, others strongly do.  This is a film that is different and better than the slasher flicks that are being released by the dozens. I am here to review the new and uncut version of the film, so here is what I enjoyed and didn't enjoy with the new version. LIKED  I enjoyed the new digital transfer, it was excellent!  I kept jumping as I heard the voice of the demon from behind me in the theater. It's rare that I can recognize the new digital transfer with classic being rereleased and digitally transferred. I also enjoyed some of the deleted scenes that were shown.  I found the best to be the first examination of Regan, where later on the doctor reveals to Chris that her daughter was using strong profanity towards him.  Unlike the original version where the terror just jumps out, it creeps up in this version.  I also enjoyed the more visions of the demon and the nice quiet dialogue scene where Father Merrin and Karras are discussing the evil they are up against.  DISLIKED  I did enjoy the visions of the demon, but on the windows?  And the doors?  It looks more comical that scary when I see those. Unless director William Fredkin and writer\/producer William Peter Blatty can come up with a good reason on why they did that, I won't accept it. But the biggest flaw is the end,  I am one who always enjoys a director's cut, THE ABYSS, ALIENS, and even the STAR WARS films redone were fantastic. But the final scene in the film where Lt. Kinderman and Father Dyer (Reverand William O'Malley) are talking about movies, takes away the errie and suspense of the original.  Where the original suddenly ended with the Jack Nitzsche Tublar Bells being played then...BOOM the credits.  It ends in a terrifying and creepy note.  But with this new ending, it's almost like a happy ending a ending that modern movie goers would enjoy.  I am a person that would always say, more is better.  But with this version, it ruins the film. This is a movie that I would find to be very scary.  It would be a great film to watch on Halloween night.  But what upset me while watching this film are the rude people who would laugh and find this movie to be funny.  Why?  What's so funny about a young girl spitting up pea soup?  I would be horrified and disgusted.  But the people who laugh at this film, are the kind that find a stupid teenager wearing a white hollow mask carrying a knife around killing teens, to be scary.  These imbeciles are the ones who find THE SIXTH SENSE to be stupid EVENT HORIZON to be weird but find SCREAM as the bomb and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID... as freaky.

The pacing, the story, the special effects and most of all Hugh Jackman!From its opening in World War II Poland to the climatic final fight on top the Statue of Liberty, this movie had me in its vice-like grip and just wouldn't let go!Far from being an action film, director Bryan Singer has done a great job in recreating the world of the X-Men on the big screen.Best of all, the movie wasn't just about some special effects thrill ride with unbelievable action scenes but rather an intelligent film which we can all relate to.The world of X-Men is not entirely unlike our own. Prejudice towards mutants in the movie echoes the racial problems of our own world.Mutants are made to feel like outcasts in the movie, something most people would be able to relate to since one time or another, we have all had the feeling of not fitting in.The movie also excelled in its realistic portrayal of human relationship. Hugh Jackman, Anna Paquin, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan all gave superb performances as mutants with human feelings, frustrations and convictions.The big brother-small sister relationship between Wolverine and Rogue was perhaps the emotional strongpoint of the movie. Great acting indeed.The on-screen relationship between Magneto and Professor Xavier too was another high-point of the film. Here are two equally brilliant minds who could have had the strongest of friendships had it not been for their opposing views on humanity's prejudice towards mutantkind.Magneto himself was not portrayed as your average I-wanna-rule-the-world villain, but rather a product of Nazi brutality towards Jewish people. Magneto is on a personal war to prevent what he sees is the beginnings of another Holocoust, this time not against Jews, but against mutants everywhere.All in all, this movie is a must see, not for its special effects (though excellent) or action (very good), but rather for the human drama.

I loved Jeff Bridge's president who constantly was ordering exotic meals, trying to stump the staff - that was a lot of fun.As much as the film makers would love to think they put plot twists into this film, they missed the mark - there were no surprises. It was easy to tell that the audience I saw this film with knew what was about to happen as they often chuckled with anticipation before each twist was revealed.On a real petty note, the title sequence for this movie was so Irwin Allen bad, it made a few people (including me) in the audience laugh out loud. Hope they didn't spend too much on it.Bottom line A nice film worth seeing that pulls on some easy heart strings (for me at least) but there isn't enough reason to see this one in the theater, it'll play well on the small screen.spoiler section -------spoiler section---------spoiler section---------spoiler section -------spoiler section---------spoiler section---------spoiler section -------spoiler section---------spoiler section---------spoiler section -------spoiler section---------spoiler section---------spoiler section -------spoiler section---------spoiler section---------spoiler section -------spoiler section---------spoiler sectionThe primary dagger against the female VP candidate is a night of rumored sexual debauchery that happened when she was in college. This issue comes to light AFTER she is selected to be VP.

In the end, she was too squeaky clean to be a politician.  There was a hint that something in her past was worthy of her stepping down (when the cute FBI agent gave Sam Elliot the investigation report) but in the end it was just a red herring used distract us, unsuccessfully.And speaking of which, wasn't that FBI agent just too damn cute? I mean when we first are introduced to her and she's interviewing Gary Oldman, didn't most of us think she was going to try and seduce him to get some dirt? Not the best casting I'm afraid, though her performance was just dandy.FWIW Then the whole Adultery perjury thing was weak and felt like filler (it was nice to see Mariel Hemingway though.)Later in the film's big twist it's divulged that the girl who drowned in the bridge accident was once a member of secret ops (or something like that) and that the accident was staged (uh-doy).  The only problem with that is, why the heck was she so stupid about getting out of the car? Anyone doing such a stunt would know to roll the window down to help equalize the water pressure.  I contend that she would have had the window down already and would had been prepared to get out quickly.The writers decided to killed her to try to disguise that this was a staged event and thus embed a twist in the film, didn't work.  Now, if they had knocked the girl out from the impact, it would have been easier to accept later on but NO they needed the dramatic images of her drowning in the car. (Plus didn't they see Abyss? She could have been revived!!!)

(A political coming of age film?)  It would be nice if some of the concepts in this film would come true, but the cynic in me doesn't see it happening any time soon, regardless I'm sure President Clinton loved some (or most) of the messages here.The film has an agenda that's not even loosely veiled. It addresses many of the issues of the last 8 years with a obvious slant towards the left. Now there is NOTHING wrong with that but 50 percent (+or - 10) of the voting population will no doubt have a problem with one (or more) of the messages being honored here.I should mention that there is also the underlying message of all we are saying, is give girls a chance - I look forward to the day when we don't have to make such pleas, someday this country will grow up...but then I watch COPs or Jerry Springer...and just sigh...sorry I'm drifting.The cast is the best thing about this film, there are some good (but not great) performances, no Oscar nominations here I'm afraid. I loved Jeff Bridge's president who constantly was ordering exotic meals, trying to stump the staff - that was a lot of fun.As much as the film makers would love to think they put plot twists into this film, they missed the mark - there were no surprises. It was easy to tell that the audience I saw this film with knew what was about to happen as they often chuckled with anticipation before each twist was revealed.On a real petty note, the title sequence for this movie was so Irwin Allen bad, it made a few people (including me) in the audience laugh out loud. Hope they didn't spend too much on it.Bottom line A nice film worth seeing that pulls on some easy heart strings (for me at least) but there isn't enough reason to see this one in the theater, it'll play well on the small screen.spoiler section -------spoiler section---------spoiler section---------spoiler section -------spoiler section---------spoiler section---------spoiler section -------spoiler section---------spoiler section---------spoiler section -------spoiler section---------spoiler section---------spoiler section -------spoiler section---------spoiler section---------spoiler section -------spoiler section---------spoiler sectionThe primary dagger against the female VP candidate is a night of rumored sexual debauchery that happened when she was in college.

The film opens on the campus of what appears to be Yale University (it is actually an unnamed Ivy League college, but the giant Y's in various parts of the campus give me that idea) with star crew member Luke McNamara (Joshua Jackson) preparing for a regatta of some sort.  This whole introduction is meant to serve as an introduction to Luke's friends, which include Chloe (Leslie Bibb), Will Beckford (Hill Harper), and Caleb Mandrake (Paul Walker) and to show how amazing of a rower Luke is, therefore making him a major candidate for The Skulls.So, surprise, surprise, Luke gets into the secret society known as The Skulls after going through a cat and mouse game involving telephones and has to join another 10 candidates in a surprisingly stupid act of vandalism that is supposed to show how superior the candidates are.  Oh and I forgot to mention how unbelievably preposterous the sets are for the mansion in which the Skulls conviene...I won't spoil them, you need to see them for yourself.  So Luke pulls off this act of petty vandalism with the help of Caleb, comes back to the center and meets Coach, I'm sorry, Judge Litten Mandrake (Craig T. Nelson), gets a skull embossed on his flesh, and a top of the line watch...pretty cool eh?  Of course, Chloe and Will are p***ed at Luke's involvement in the Skulls, and tempers flare.  Not long after though, Luke finds the perks of being in The Skulls, which include cars, ladies, and parties (none of which I have...heh heh)...but this has to come at a price, right, or there would be no conflict and the movie would just end.Now here is the point of the film that I want to keep in the dark, because whatever intrigue this film might have happens in this part of the film on.  All I think I should tell you is that a little campus dischord erupts..and Will ends up in a noose in the school's newspaper office. This leads to a downfall including paranoia, confusion, and fear.  Oh yeah and the obligatory steamy shower sex scene (how about that for alliteration?)As a film, The Skulls fails on many levels.  Rob Cohen's direction is a mix of formulaic let's set the camera here and swivel it around shots and half-way through, during Luke's breakdown scene, tries to become stylish. Of course it doesn't matter that the script, by John Pogue, while based on something very interesting, is just one big generic thriller that could have been based anywhere.  I must commend Pogue on staying away from the easy cliches in the scipt, not that he stays away from cliches altogheter, not many films do that anymore.  The acting from everyone is supbar to say the most...there were points when I really like Joshua (he at times reminds me of a young Tom Hanks) and there were points when I just hated him.  Leslie and Hill are just blah in their roles.  Paul Walker just gives an overall vague performance...basically every performance he has given in his short (and hopefully shortened even more)career.  The elders in the cast, Craig T. Nelson, and a woefully underused Christopher McDonald, resort to overindulging their bizarre dialogue (the former) and barely talking and just getting the hell beaten out of him (the latter).  One thing good that comes from Nelson's performance is his wonderful moustache!  But with all these small gripes, I still got some moderate enjoyment out of this movie. It was just an unpretentious movie, that sure may have taken itself seriously, but it did keep me interested and did much more for me then I expected a movie with this esteemed crew involved.  So I would say this is a good rent if you have a girlfriend or wife to yourself for a night, or you are just in the mood for something you don't have to think too much about.My Rating 6 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 October 2000","score":"","review":"  Well after a long sabbatical from writing movie reviews...and I am sure you all missed me, I have returned to my former glory by doing a write up on a movie that I am sure you are all eagerly anticipating my review on...The Skulls.But before I get too far into my review, I want to tell you watch out for some minor spoilers that I may include in this review...alright so here we go.

Of course it doesn't matter that the script, by John Pogue, while based on something very interesting, is just one big generic thriller that could have been based anywhere.  I must commend Pogue on staying away from the easy cliches in the scipt, not that he stays away from cliches altogheter, not many films do that anymore.  The acting from everyone is supbar to say the most...there were points when I really like Joshua (he at times reminds me of a young Tom Hanks) and there were points when I just hated him.

The elders in the cast, Craig T. Nelson, and a woefully underused Christopher McDonald, resort to overindulging their bizarre dialogue (the former) and barely talking and just getting the hell beaten out of him (the latter).  One thing good that comes from Nelson's performance is his wonderful moustache!  But with all these small gripes, I still got some moderate enjoyment out of this movie. It was just an unpretentious movie, that sure may have taken itself seriously, but it did keep me interested and did much more for me then I expected a movie with this esteemed crew involved.

The film opens on the campus of what appears to be Yale University (it is actually an unnamed Ivy League college, but the giant Y's in various parts of the campus give me that idea) with star crew member Luke McNamara (Joshua Jackson) preparing for a regatta of some sort.  This whole introduction is meant to serve as an introduction to Luke's friends, which include Chloe (Leslie Bibb), Will Beckford (Hill Harper), and Caleb Mandrake (Paul Walker) and to show how amazing of a rower Luke is, therefore making him a major candidate for The Skulls.So, surprise, surprise, Luke gets into the secret society known as The Skulls after going through a cat and mouse game involving telephones and has to join another 10 candidates in a surprisingly stupid act of vandalism that is supposed to show how superior the candidates are.  Oh and I forgot to mention how unbelievably preposterous the sets are for the mansion in which the Skulls conviene...I won't spoil them, you need to see them for yourself.

The answer to that is, inarguably, yes; just as we must be reminded of the Holocaust lest we forget and allow history to repeat itself, we have to at least keep somewhat abreast of anything which so significantly affects our lives.  And unfortunately (some would say), politics is one of those things, and whether we approach it actively or view it all with passive ambiguity, the fact remains that what happens in government affects us all in one way or another on a daily basis.  `The Contender,' written and directed by Rod Lurie, is a serious and sensitive examination of the political machinations employed to effect power and control within a democracy.  In Lurie's scenario, the position of Vice President of The United States has been open for three weeks and must be filled.  President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges) makes his choice  Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen), who would be the first woman in history to hold the position.  First, however, she must be confirmed.

It becomes not so much a case of good against evil so much as simply a question of what is right and what is wrong, who draws the line and who decides when and where that line  should be crossed.  To his credit, Lurie objectively presents both sides of the story without delving so deep as to mire the proceedings down with any unnecessary baggage merely to introduce any subjective leanings or to manipulate the audience one way or another.  It's like a political campaign; viewers are left to decide for themselves and cast their vote as they may.   \tThe theme of the story itself is not virgin territory, but the way it's handled and delivered, including some exceptionally strong performances (there should be some Oscar nominations here), makes it unique.  Joan Allen adds another exemplary performance to her resume, further demonstrating her great prowess as an actress.

And Gary Oldman (in what is an uncharacteristic role for him) is absolutely dynamic as the ultra-conservative Shelly Runyon, who proves to be a most formidable opponent to Hanson and Evans.

The excellent supporting cast includes Christian Slater (Reginald Webster), Sam Elliott (Kermit), William Petersen (Hathaway), Philip Baker Hall (Oscar), Mike Binder (Lewis), Robin Thomas (William Hanson) and Saul Rubinek (Jerry).  Lurie allows only a single lapse into melodrama (patriotic music begins to swell about half-way through Hanson's final speech), but the closing speech by President Evans is impeccably delivered with force and strength, and his words are exhilarating; how satisfying it is to hear things said that must and should be said, if only in the movies.

I know it's a vain hope, given the weight of popular opinion, but someone should point out how mediocre this film really is, how little it has to say about life in general, and how much less about real life in England in the 1980s.At home in the UK it has been hyped as the new Full Monty, much like every new home-grown film that isn't the new Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  Now, if memory serves, The Full Monty was a comedy, so did I just fall asleep and miss the joke?  This film is a dull, predictable, parochial melodrama about a self-obsessed, untalented child who lays waste to the lives of those around him, set against a background of grim, working class calamity worn to cliche by overuse.  Oh ha ha ha.  Stop, please, I can't breathe.If you've been watching British movies over the last 5 years you'd be forgiven for thinking the only socially, historically significant event here since the end of World War 2 was the 1984 Miner's Strike.  On the bright side, obviously, it meant the plucky if sexually frustrated men of our nation could rise to the challenge of adversity with a host of quirky alternative lifestyles, from stripping, or playing in a brass band, to re-painting the electricity pylons that stride across our rolling countryside.  The British film industry has subjected hundreds of thousands of us to this grim procession of increasingly overwrought and improbable stories, the least and hopefully last of which is this strange fairy-tale of a graceless, limply homo-erotic ballet dancer and his cartoon grotesque family.It's a timeless story, in the worst possible sense.  Even with the home advantage for cultural references, I couldn't tell when it was supposed to be set. The cobbled streets and narrow back-alleys of the Northern town setting have become all-purpose visual shorthand for the deprived English working class from any time since the Victorians.  Billy and his brother listen to mid-70s T. Rex the way kids do only to contemporary pop.  The house is decorated in drab 70s kitsch, and the kids' clothes are straight out of a 70s revival costume grab-bag.  The boys look very fey in their tight T-shirts, which I'm sure is the effect they were looking for, but they're jarringly out of time.You can't blame the writer for the way the set was dressed, but who else takes responsibility for the one-dimensional characters?  It's become an easy refuge for serious British screenwriters to surround a young central character with surly, bitter adult men, physically brutal with no verbal or emotional vocabulary, and sexually frustrated, ironic women.  Every older man here is a grim, taciturn, proud, homophobic drunk.  There's no scope for subtle character playing, all emotion arises out of frustration and  confrontation,  so most family arguments just play at the HIGHEST POSSIBLE VOLUME.  Even Julie Walters takes refuge here when called on to be anything more than ironically brusque.The children are emotionally and sexually liberated, something their parents either don't believe or can't understand.  This is less an analysis of the hot-house maturity of modern children, particularly since this is a historical tale set in the 70s or 80s, than a springboard for some cheap thrills and laughs.  The dance teacher's equally pre-pubescent daughter suggests, I'll show you me fanny - hopefully dubbed to pussy in the U.S. so viewers didn't miss the point - and what were we supposed to make of their sexy pre-teen-on-pre-teen pillow fight and feathery fondling?  Billy's best friend, the 11 year old son of a transvestite, puts on his sister's dress, paints Billy with make-up and tries to kiss him.  I'm sure the writer found these moments edgy and confrontational, rather than either lame or salacious.Finally, at the heart of the film, the dance sequences are laughable.  The young actor has neither style or grace, and the budget apparently didn't run to a choreographer.  What we're presented with might be charming from a dearly loved 8 year old, but you wouldn't expect a major dance institution to take it seriously.  The black kid in Fame who aces the auditions as O.J. Simpson getting into an elevator in Towering Inferno is more convincing.This isn't a great and life-affirming film, it's a tired and dull re-tread of a very old story.  Billy is an unpleasant character, leaving a trail of broken spirits and humiliation in his wake.  He breaks his father's spirit completely, forced to compromise every principle, reduced to tears and humiliated in front of his work-mates, and patronised by the alien life forms at the Royal Ballet School.  Two of his peers fling their budding sexuality at his feet, he teases both and casts one aside without a thought.  The ballet teacher is, ultimately, used and cast aside too.  Her rejection at the first audition is thoughtless, his half-hearted attempt to thank her later pitiful, and the bitter emptiness of her disappointment as they part is clear.  This is echoed and magnified in the final scene, when she is excluded from his success.Oh ha ha ha.  Please, please stop.  I can't stand it.

I'm sure the writer found these moments edgy and confrontational, rather than either lame or salacious.Finally, at the heart of the film, the dance sequences are laughable.  The young actor has neither style or grace, and the budget apparently didn't run to a choreographer.  What we're presented with might be charming from a dearly loved 8 year old, but you wouldn't expect a major dance institution to take it seriously.  The black kid in Fame who aces the auditions as O.J. Simpson getting into an elevator in Towering Inferno is more convincing.This isn't a great and life-affirming film, it's a tired and dull re-tread of a very old story.  Billy is an unpleasant character, leaving a trail of broken spirits and humiliation in his wake.  He breaks his father's spirit completely, forced to compromise every principle, reduced to tears and humiliated in front of his work-mates, and patronised by the alien life forms at the Royal Ballet School.  Two of his peers fling their budding sexuality at his feet, he teases both and casts one aside without a thought.  The ballet teacher is, ultimately, used and cast aside too.  Her rejection at the first audition is thoughtless, his half-hearted attempt to thank her later pitiful, and the bitter emptiness of her disappointment as they part is clear.  This is echoed and magnified in the final scene, when she is excluded from his success.Oh ha ha ha.  Please, please stop.  I can't stand it.

I know it's a vain hope, given the weight of popular opinion, but someone should point out how mediocre this film really is, how little it has to say about life in general, and how much less about real life in England in the 1980s.At home in the UK it has been hyped as the new Full Monty, much like every new home-grown film that isn't the new Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  Now, if memory serves, The Full Monty was a comedy, so did I just fall asleep and miss the joke?  This film is a dull, predictable, parochial melodrama about a self-obsessed, untalented child who lays waste to the lives of those around him, set against a background of grim, working class calamity worn to cliche by overuse.  Oh ha ha ha.  Stop, please, I can't breathe.If you've been watching British movies over the last 5 years you'd be forgiven for thinking the only socially, historically significant event here since the end of World War 2 was the 1984 Miner's Strike.  On the bright side, obviously, it meant the plucky if sexually frustrated men of our nation could rise to the challenge of adversity with a host of quirky alternative lifestyles, from stripping, or playing in a brass band, to re-painting the electricity pylons that stride across our rolling countryside.  The British film industry has subjected hundreds of thousands of us to this grim procession of increasingly overwrought and improbable stories, the least and hopefully last of which is this strange fairy-tale of a graceless, limply homo-erotic ballet dancer and his cartoon grotesque family.It's a timeless story, in the worst possible sense.  Even with the home advantage for cultural references, I couldn't tell when it was supposed to be set. The cobbled streets and narrow back-alleys of the Northern town setting have become all-purpose visual shorthand for the deprived English working class from any time since the Victorians.  Billy and his brother listen to mid-70s T. Rex the way kids do only to contemporary pop.  The house is decorated in drab 70s kitsch, and the kids' clothes are straight out of a 70s revival costume grab-bag.  The boys look very fey in their tight T-shirts, which I'm sure is the effect they were looking for, but they're jarringly out of time.You can't blame the writer for the way the set was dressed, but who else takes responsibility for the one-dimensional characters?  It's become an easy refuge for serious British screenwriters to surround a young central character with surly, bitter adult men, physically brutal with no verbal or emotional vocabulary, and sexually frustrated, ironic women.  Every older man here is a grim, taciturn, proud, homophobic drunk.  There's no scope for subtle character playing, all emotion arises out of frustration and  confrontation,  so most family arguments just play at the HIGHEST POSSIBLE VOLUME.  Even Julie Walters takes refuge here when called on to be anything more than ironically brusque.The children are emotionally and sexually liberated, something their parents either don't believe or can't understand.  This is less an analysis of the hot-house maturity of modern children, particularly since this is a historical tale set in the 70s or 80s, than a springboard for some cheap thrills and laughs.  The dance teacher's equally pre-pubescent daughter suggests, I'll show you me fanny - hopefully dubbed to pussy in the U.S. so viewers didn't miss the point - and what were we supposed to make of their sexy pre-teen-on-pre-teen pillow fight and feathery fondling?

A great theme song by Paul McCartney is mismatched with Roger Moore, the worst Bond ever. On Her Majesty's Secret Service has one of the best themes ever, a powerful instrumental that sums up the film without any vocals being needed at all. GoldenEye has one of the best themes ever recorded, by a woman who was just born to sing a Bond theme. If my voice is anywhere near as powerful as Tina Turner's when I get to be that age, I'll be a happy man. The World Is Not Enough even features a good song by an indie band, which is no small feat considering their usual pseudo-alternative drivel is only a step above (c)rap.Then there's Tomorrow Never Dies. I don't know who the hell decided that Sheryl Crow could sing a Bond theme song, but it is no surprise to me at all that she hasn't recorded a thing since Tomorrow Never Dies opened in 1997. It's as if she listened to her voice during the premiere and came to the shocking realisation that her vocals suck harder than a V-8 Powered Hoover. Adding insult to injury in this film is the closing number by K.D. Lang. Lang knows how to sing a song with class and style, even if her earlier work doesn't indicate this. Crow is clearly trying to give an operatic performance, and is way out of her depth, which isn't hard considering she has about as vocal much talent as my cat... oh, wait, my cat can actually hold a tune...Then there's the plot itself. Media mogul starts a war between China and the UK in order to sell more newspapers. Are they for real? Let's compare this with the plot for GoldenEye and The World Is Not Enough, shall we? GoldenEye features a mob of mad, ethnocentric Russian terrorists who steal an electromagnetic pulse weapon, with the intent of discharging it over England. The World Is Not Enough features an insane terrorist and an oil magnate's daugther who want to irradiate the world's oil supply for their own individual purposes. And then we have the media mogul who wants to start a war between two of the world's largest empires in order to sell more newspapers. Does that sound a bit lame by comparison, or is it just me?However, the worst part of this film is the villains. GoldenEye had a sex-mad helicopter pilot who derived pleasure from killing things, and a traitorous secret agent who is known personally to Bond. The World Is Not Enough featured a terrorist who, as implausible as he is, at least acted well enough to be menacing. Eliot Carver is, by comparison, a light warm-up. I could have walked in and torn his head off within the first five minutes of the film. Without Stamper as a bodyguard, he is quite literally nothing.Adding to these problems is the fact that the Australian release of this film appears to have been cut by the BBFC (at least on the DVD version), and a number of sequences fail to make any sense as a result. Sorry, gang, but this is the biggest dud in the Bond franchise since the entire Moore period. Maybe we could try an OHMSS-style film with Brosnan... heaven knows we need a film where Bond does more than exhibit the Rambo-syndrome. Eighteen films of it is more than enough.By the way, Denise Richards is one hell of an actress. She reminds me of an old girlfriend in every role she's played so far, which is an excellent quality by any standards. She was given one hell of a raw deal in comparison to Teri Hatcher, past Bond women like Carey Lowell, or future Bond women such as Halle Berry. At least Richards got past the overemphasised-voice-to-start-conversation school of acting. Seriously, what were they thinking in the Bond camp when they saw Hatcher's resumé? Let's get the most annoying non-actor to play the Bond girl and one of the most try-hard vocalists to do the theme song? Sorry guys, but lowering Bond to the standards of the pop media just doesn't work. A pity they did not learn this before Advertise Another Day basically killed the series for good.
