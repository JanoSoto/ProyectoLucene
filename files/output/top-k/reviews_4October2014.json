Its a prestigious title for a film that can be found in the Walmart bargain-bin, packaged with its sequel. Yet once again, I found myself quite disappointed.The plot and character is surprisingly stock. The Secret of NIMH's writing does feel like a standard kid's film. There's little development, few deviations from what'd you expect. There's the hero, the villain, the comedic relief. Mrs. Brisby is likable, at least. I just felt more could have been done with the world presented. And let's not forget that deus ex machina at the ending.NIMH's strengths are its animation, and its use of tone. NIMH is aesthetically dark, making the forest and underground look like horrific worlds. The Great Owl and Nicodemus are great highlights of the film. You feel such a powerful, intimidating aura, like these characters possess inhuman knowledge, and they're talking animals! I can see how this movie chills people to their bones.If this aesthetic interests you, then its worth checking out. It didn't impress me too much, but I decided to be more lenient.

Before Sunrise is what you get when you strip away all of the flash, all the flare, and all the cluttering visual elements of a story and instead simply turn on the camera and allow two actors to be together and tell a story completely driven by poignant dialogue. Before Sunrise stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy as Jesse and Celine, respectively. Jesse, an American traveling Europe for his own vague reasons, meets Celine, a French girl, on a train on the way to Vienna. The two immediately strike up conversation and wind up taking a spontaneous trip through Vienna together, where they slowly fall in love, despite their inevitable split the next day when they both must return to their respective home countries. It's a beautifully told tale of blossoming love, while tragedy looms in the background.Richard Linklater loves telling stories in unconventionally unique ways, and Before Sunrise is one of his earliest and most successful attempts at unique storytelling. Of course, the film's uniqueness stems from its simplicity. I feel like if you go into this movie expecting any more than talking you are doomed to hate it. But, if you go into it expecting rich dialogue and textured characters contemplating life, love, and the universe, you are bound to really enjoy this film.There really isn't a whole lot to say about this lovely little film, because all of its charm and beauty stems from its simplicity. There is so little to this movie, and yet so much to enjoy as you fall in love with these characters, subsequently just falling in love with the whole idea of love, because Hawke and Delpy make it look like such a naturally magnificent thing. You have here a film that essentially goes nowhere (it all does take place in one city in one night), yet takes you on such a journey into the psyche and the dynamics of these two fascinating characters who, along the way, meet a whole cast of other interesting and eccentric individuals who move the story along.If anything is wrong with this movie it's that you can see the slight inexperience in Linklater's writing, something he has obviously overcome because he has made a slew of other fantastic films since making what is only his third feature film. The script, albeit very well written, does walk the line between superficial and profound at times. And yet the conceited ideals our protagonists exude coincide with the youthful ignorance this film beautifully portrays in its characters.This film captures the spirit of its characters, and draws you into accepting all of the decisions which, in retrospect, might have been foolish. A girl getting off a train with a stranger she just met to visit a town she's never been to seems like a bad idea if you ask me, but Before Sunrise convinces us so genuinely that love is real and will conquer all.

But honestly, it's just not that good. I mean, considering the low budget, they did a good job with it, but it had a lot left to be desired. Mad Max' story is sort of basic. Max kills a guy named the Nightrider and the bad guys gang comes after him. The issue is, Max doesn't feel developed enough. I couldn't tell you more than the fact that he's a badass and has a wife and kid. I also feel like every other character is under developed. The bad guys are just crazy as hell, and we don't know why other than that they are bad guys. A lot of the plot focuses on Max, and because he's under developed, the plot falls flat. But I will say he is a cool character and I do understand why sequels were made, which I plan to watch.Another thing I noticed is the setting. We know that's its years in the future, but not too far ahead. We kind of get the sense that society is a little more broken down, but not completely. They still have TV and police and restaurants and stuff. But from what I have seen of the sequels, it looks completely like an apocalyptic wasteland. There are two reasons I think that this first film doesn't seem as run down. Either their low budget didn't allow them to show the world as apocalyptic as they wanted it to be, or it's supposed to be early in the apocalypse. I think it's due to budget restraints, but I guess I will talk about that more when I review The Road Warrior. The point is, the whole world feels underdeveloped and left unexplained, confusing the viewer.Also, the music in this film is very... out of place. It sounds VERY 70's, but like some kind of music from an epic fantasy film or Star Wars. It was distracting, cheesy, and took away from a lot of the scenes.Mad Max is a cult classic, and there is some fun to be had. The last like 10 - 15 minutes are pretty cool and show that Max can be a really cool character that warrants sequels, but I have a feeling those sequels are much, much better than this one. It disappointed me overall, but got me excited to check out the next movie in the series.

I have read some excellent reviews on it and don't know as I can much improve on what's already been said, but I do have one or two comments I'd like to add to the mix. First is regarding the confusing beginning. I was lost for that half hour, but thereafter the film righted itself and the rest was captivating.

The summary is really only necessary for the first and last half hours.)I think the thing that must be reemphasized is that this film is a reenactment of an Inuit legend intended for Inuit audiences. The Inuit already know the legend and do not need the beginning (or any other part of it) to be blatantly laid out. It is similar to our recent movies about Hansel and Gretel and Jack and the Beanstalk. Those two films would be confusing if you had no back story, but due to our culture, most of us are very familiar with the tales. Better parallels could be some of the super-hero films coming out today. We have all known about Kryptonite since grade-school. But if you grew up in an isolated state, the Superman movies would also be pretty confusing. Finally, this film was intended for Inuit audiences. We are really just voyeurs allowed to peek in and experience their world. There was never any intention to compete with Hollywood and this film does not measure up to ALL the Hollywood ideals. But it is a timeless story filmed in a beautiful location with wonderful actors (anyone who says otherwise has no familiarity with northern peoples.).

In the decade before television, the major studios had a movie a week to get into theaters and so with that schedule one movie was just as important as another. 'Casablanca' was not expected to do well (or rather not nearly as well as it did) even though the cast was first rate &#x96; Humprey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. It doesn't comfortably fit a genre, its plot is too complicated to put into an ad and, in the maelstrom of World War II, movies about the events overseas were a tough sell unless they had John Wayne or Gary Cooper blasting the Axis powers back to the Stone Age.When it was released late in 1942 it quickly found audiences lined up around the block to see it. Part of its appeal I think was the timeliness of the subject. This was a time when Hitler's armies were spreading across Europe and a time when no one knew what the Nazis were going to do next. That uncertainty is present in the film. There is a desperation that is always present just beneath the surface of 'Casablanca', the pervasive dread of the Nazi death grip on the world.The movie takes place in the tiny village of Casablanca in Northern Morocco, one of the last French occupied countries not in the grip of the Nazis. As the movie opens it has become a human traffic jam of refugees trying to get money and transport to Lisbon where they can catch a plane to America. Few opportunities arise to book such a passage so many find themselves stranded for days weeks and even months. At the center of this chaos is Casablanca's most popular nightspot Rick's Café Americain which is run by Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) a man who remains steadfast at staying out of political affairs ('I stick my neck out for no one' he says).One day he is given an order by police chief Louis Renault (Claude Rains) that a man wanted by the Reich is on his way to Casablanca and that Rick is to make sure that he stays in Casablanca. The man, Victor Lazlo (Paul Henreid), escaped a concentration camp and is now a major figure in the French resistance and his passage to Lisbon would be a bit detrimental to the Reich. Rick isn't interested but in the interest of humoring Renault he agrees. What he doesn't know is that Lazlo is currently married to Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), a woman that left Rick standing alone on a rainy train platform some years earlier with a Dear John letter soaking in his hand (this is part of the reason that he has retreated to Casablanca). He has held a deep resentment for years so naturally this reopens old wounds as Victor and Ilsa enter Rick's club and Rick grieves that 'Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine'.There is a legitimate reason that Ilsa left Rick and when she reveals it to him, he understands but she falls into a quandary. She loves Rick and can't bear to hurt him again but she loves Lazlo and she must she knows that he needs her now more than ever. Bergman's performance as the emotionally confused Ilsa is due in part to the fact that during filming she was never told which man she was going to end up with. She twists and turns with confused emotions and we never see her leaning one way or the other. When Rick tells her in the end that she is getting on the plane with Lazlo her face reveals confusion as she tries to comprehend it. The moment is very real. If she knew how the movie was going to end, I don't think that the subtleties of her performance would be as present.Bogart, known at this point for his cold tough guy roles, showed a sensitive side here and hereafter is where he flourished as a leading man. As Rick, he is cold to those who come looking for a favor but in Ilsa's eyes he simply melts. This was a side of Bogart that was new to audiences and it changed his image for the rest of his career. This was his best performance so naturally he lost the Oscar to an unworthy contender Paul Lukas in 'Watch on the Rhine' (heard of it? Me neither?). Bogart would win the Oscar for 1951's 'The African Queen' continuing the academy's strange habit (after Cagney in 'Yankee Doodle Dandy and Gable in 'It Happened One Night) of giving Oscars to Hollywood tough guys for sensitive pussycat roles.I greatly admire the screenwriters Julius and Philip Epstein and Howard Koch for their restraint. It must have been tempting to present the Nazis dominating the screen but the presence of too many might have lessened the credibility that Lazlo could escape. Also, it must have been so tempting in a movie with this much star power and this much emotion to supply an ending that would find Rick and Ilsa in each other's arms. That would have been a mistake. Rick's change of heart is the most important aspect of the film. He realizes that he must let her go in the interest of the greater good, that Lazlo, off on his mission, needs her now more than ever. The script allows the characters to follow their hearts rather than some kind of crowd pleasing convention. It took nerve to allow the characters to find the courage of their convictions, that the cause of stopping the Nazi's is far more important because they realize that their personal problems just 'don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world'.

Problem is that despite serving her sentence, Elizabeth also known as Libby (Ashley Judd) is under parole for a further 2 years under the watchful eyes of a parole officer called Travis Lehman (Tommy Lee Jones) so Libby (Ashley Judd) has a very tough task in seeking out the truth about her husband despite her release. Like I have mentioned, the film was good which will keep the viewer interested, but plot to me seemed a tad weak and could've been a lot better. One of the major things that makes this film good is that it is emotional, you the viewer will strongly feel for the character that Ashley Judd played - Libby and will instantly support her mission in seeking out truth and justice. From a personal point of view, it is hard to swallow that an innocent and caring woman can be locked behind bars for several years, but the beautiful thing about it is that the character Libby can keep her composure and be so patient to seek the truth.

The driver, instead of helping him tries to get rid of the body. Its then when he begins to be plagued by a strange curse that deformed his body and transforms him into a flesh-metal monster without being able to do something to stop it. This is the most remarkable movie from writer and director Shinya Tsukamoto. It was released in 1989 and it counts with Tomorowo Taguchi, Kei Fujiwara, Nobu Kanaoka and Shinya Tsukamoto himself as the cast. It is the first story of a whole trilogy also created by Tsukamoto. -Tetsuo The Iron Man(1989); Tetsuo II Body Hammer(1992); Tetsuo The Bullet Man(2010). It is based in a piece that he had already directed and interpreted at his University. The movie could be taken as a horror or science fiction film. However, it would be more proper to consider it to be part of the so-called cyberpunk movement, which is more like a sub genre of science fiction. It is actually considered to be the most representative piece of this sub genre. It had a really good reception by the Japanese audience even though the low budget that was actually used to make it. It was so low, that the director Tsukamoto was not just producing, directing and acting but taking care of half of the cinematography as well. The other half was on the hands of cinematographer Kei Fujiwara. This is also Tsukamoto's style, as he always wanted to control every aspect of his films since that was the way he took in all his previous non- professional projects. One change that did happened in this movie was the use of 16mm, being Super 8 what he was using until this film. The movie is entirely shot in black and white and it has an important use of the stop-motion technique, also used so many times by Tsukamoto in other films. Looking at the story, what we see is a lineal plot told in a non-lineal way. The story starts with a confrontation for our protagonist, a situation where his world changes, and asks him to change as well. All of a sudden his body is transforming into a metallic monster and he does not even know the reason. Then, he will have to fight against this terrible curse and all the odds that it implies in order to understand what is going on. The most obvious one the problem that it will bring to his marriage. Finally, he will get the chance to face his actual enemy and decide between fight him or accept his fate and join him in an apocalyptic war against the world. As I said, this is basic lineal storytelling, but the way is told is not that simple. The time structure gets altered several times by jumps in the time or by showing which seems to be a different dimension where this dark figure laughs and reacts to different situations. I would like to think he represents the curse itself, but this idea is never made clear enough to the audience, who gets confuse and lost in this mechanical and full of rusty cables maze. But, of course, this is the plan. That is the feeling the creator wants to put on us. Not just the plot will make us feel this claustrophobic and terrific feeling. It will be helped majestically by a really unique visual style. Constantly dirty shots made of cables, metal, pieces of junk and low-key lighting. Never got a clear shot and close- ups and extreme close-ups are everywhere. Of course the editing does his part as well. Super fast cuts, that barely let you see or understand the action; the use of the stop-motion technique for to help the special effect sometimes but also to give that mechanic felling of robotic movement. The persecution scene at the final battle is a masterpiece of editing storytelling in a lot of senses. The use of this technique to move the characters throughout Tokyo, transforming the city into metal while fighting, gives that scene a unique feeling of action. It is also in this part when we can see some of the influences from manga that this movie has. Because this movie as well as it is inspirational for other pieces or styles, it is also clearly inspired by some other authors. David Cronenberg's Videodrome(1983); The Fly(1986); David Lynch's Eraser-head(1976); Katsuhiro Ôtomo's Akira(1988) released just the year before Tetsuo; or even Ridley Scott's Blade Runner(1982). Another interesting aspect of this movie is the soundtrack and sound design, created by composer Chu Ishikawa. It really goes with the mood of the movie, giving that weird and bizarre feeling. Sometimes it seems like we are just listening to a saw cutting stones or to a metal denture chewing glass. It is really an artwork perfectly chosen for the perfect motive. Tetsuo The Iron Man is, definitely an amazing movie that tells a story in a weird cause-effect logic but that still understandable for the audience who males this travel throughout the mechanic and dirty world that the creator presents. The motivation in the story, even though looks kind of non-sense, still realistic within the world of the film ́s fiction. Therefore, the events are believable since beginning to end. It is also, as I said before, considered the most representative film from the cyberpunk movement, so the audience has to be ready for a non-conventional style where from society within the story, to the visual style keeps reminding you that you are entering a world full of bizarre physics, strange sounds and completely crazy characters who will try to survive this claustrophobic world.

The driver, instead of helping him tries to get rid of the body. Its then when he begins to be plagued by a strange curse that deformed his body and transforms him into a flesh-metal monster without being able to do something to stop it. This is the most remarkable movie from writer and director Shinya Tsukamoto. It was released in 1989 and it counts with Tomorowo Taguchi, Kei Fujiwara, Nobu Kanaoka and Shinya Tsukamoto himself as the cast. It is the first story of a whole trilogy also created by Tsukamoto. -Tetsuo The Iron Man(1989); Tetsuo II Body Hammer(1992); Tetsuo The Bullet Man(2010). It is based in a piece that he had already directed and interpreted at his University. The movie could be taken as a horror or science fiction film. However, it would be more proper to consider it to be part of the so-called cyberpunk movement, which is more like a sub genre of science fiction. It is actually considered to be the most representative piece of this sub genre. It had a really good reception by the Japanese audience even though the low budget that was actually used to make it. It was so low, that the director Tsukamoto was not just producing, directing and acting but taking care of half of the cinematography as well. The other half was on the hands of cinematographer Kei Fujiwara. This is also Tsukamoto's style, as he always wanted to control every aspect of his films since that was the way he took in all his previous non- professional projects. One change that did happened in this movie was the use of 16mm, being Super 8 what he was using until this film. The movie is entirely shot in black and white and it has an important use of the stop-motion technique, also used so many times by Tsukamoto in other films. Looking at the story, what we see is a lineal plot told in a non-lineal way. The story starts with a confrontation for our protagonist, a situation where his world changes, and asks him to change as well. All of a sudden his body is transforming into a metallic monster and he does not even know the reason. Then, he will have to fight against this terrible curse and all the odds that it implies in order to understand what is going on. The most obvious one the problem that it will bring to his marriage. Finally, he will get the chance to face his actual enemy and decide between fight him or accept his fate and join him in an apocalyptic war against the world. As I said, this is basic lineal storytelling, but the way is told is not that simple. The time structure gets altered several times by jumps in the time or by showing which seems to be a different dimension where this dark figure laughs and reacts to different situations. I would like to think he represents the curse itself, but this idea is never made clear enough to the audience, who gets confuse and lost in this mechanical and full of rusty cables maze. But, of course, this is the plan. That is the feeling the creator wants to put on us. Not just the plot will make us feel this claustrophobic and terrific feeling. It will be helped majestically by a really unique visual style. Constantly dirty shots made of cables, metal, pieces of junk and low-key lighting. Never got a clear shot and close- ups and extreme close-ups are everywhere. Of course the editing does his part as well. Super fast cuts, that barely let you see or understand the action; the use of the stop-motion technique for to help the special effect sometimes but also to give that mechanic felling of robotic movement. The persecution scene at the final battle is a masterpiece of editing storytelling in a lot of senses. The use of this technique to move the characters throughout Tokyo, transforming the city into metal while fighting, gives that scene a unique feeling of action. It is also in this part when we can see some of the influences from manga that this movie has. Because this movie as well as it is inspirational for other pieces or styles, it is also clearly inspired by some other authors. David Cronenberg's Videodrome(1983); The Fly(1986); David Lynch's Eraser-head(1976); Katsuhiro Ôtomo's Akira(1988) released just the year before Tetsuo; or even Ridley Scott's Blade Runner(1982). Another interesting aspect of this movie is the soundtrack and sound design, created by composer Chu Ishikawa. It really goes with the mood of the movie, giving that weird and bizarre feeling. Sometimes it seems like we are just listening to a saw cutting stones or to a metal denture chewing glass. It is really an artwork perfectly chosen for the perfect motive.

The movie tells the story about a frustrated ex- journalist named Charles Tatum (played by Kirk Douglas, who gives the finest performance of his career since that of Spartacus (1960)) who ends up working for a newspaper in Albuquerque, New Mexico and is assigned to cover a story about a rattlesnake hunt with a fellow worker named Herbie Cook (played by Robert Arthur. While on the way to a town six hours away form where he works he learns about a man named Leo Minosa (played by Richard Benedict)who is trapped in a 450 year old ancient Indian dwelling. While watching this movie the plot reminded me a lot of Sidney Lumet's 1975 masterpiece Dog Day Afternoon because of the few similarities between the two films. This is one of the best Billy Wilder movies that I have seen in a long time along with Witness for the Prosecution (1957), The Apartment (1960), Sunset Boulevard (1950), Some like It Hot (1959), and The Spirit of St. Louis (1957). The Kirk Douglas performance reminds me of John Wayne's career defining performance that he gave in The Searchers (1956). I do find it hard to believe that this movie was only nominated for one Oscar at the 24th Oscar ceremony when I really do think that it should have been nominated for much more awards but the crappy excuse at the time was that it was a critical and commercial failure at the time this movie was released into theaters which I find to be really unfortunate because of how great this movie actually is.

In One-Hour Photo, he plays the role of Seymour, an incredibly nice guy who wants to be part of a family, but who doesn't understand boundaries and ends up terrorizing the Yorkin family and doing more harm than good. He knows Nina Yorkin and her son because he's a photo lab technician at a wholesale Wal-Mart\/Costco looking store. He often develops photos of the Yorkin family but secretly keeps doubles, which he uses to build a massive collage on his wall. He has no kids, wife, even a roommate, and it's not only disturbing and creepy, but very sad to watch as Seymour's mental stability degrades to the point where he's taking photographs of his boss' daughter as blackmail and revealing to Nina that her husband cheated on her multiple times with some skanky woman.One-Hour Photo is by no means a horror film, but it certainly makes you think. Could the mailman who always brings your letters, your local pharmacist, the pizza delivery guy, want to be more than just a friendly service?

In One-Hour Photo, he plays the role of Seymour, an incredibly nice guy who wants to be part of a family, but who doesn't understand boundaries and ends up terrorizing the Yorkin family and doing more harm than good. He knows Nina Yorkin and her son because he's a photo lab technician at a wholesale Wal-Mart\/Costco looking store. He often develops photos of the Yorkin family but secretly keeps doubles, which he uses to build a massive collage on his wall.

Reputedly the cast and crew actually did play Rollerball (presumably with penalties, substitutions and time limits rather than the ultimate no holds barred version we see at the end?) in between takes and really got into it. I wonder if there's any film of that? In the 70s 2000AD magazine had a comic strip 'inspired' by Rollerball where the players wore jetpacks which is about the only way you could make the game more exciting.What makes it special though is that it's not just a glorification of a brutal futuristic sport but a study of the role of the individual in a civilized society. Thomas Mann would recognise the concept although he probably wouldn't have included motorbikes in it. The future is depicted as a quasi-benign dictatorship as Plato always advocated. We have no wars, no crime, no poverty, corporations run the show and conflicts are confined to the boardroom and stock exchange. People are free within the system as long as they don't question the established order. Some have described it as fascist but actually it strikes me as more communistic, the individual sublimated for the sake of the greater good. However mankind never changes so an outlet is needed for aggression and populist entertainment. Hence we have Rollerball. Problem is in a society which values conformity Jonathan E has become an individualistic superstar and that threatens the whole nature of society. Great performance from James Caan and equally great from John Houseman who isn't exactly the villain, it's very subtle on his part, you can't really be sure who's right or wrong in all this (noticeably Houseman's character doesn't want Jonathan to have an 'accident'). Also like Shame Rimmer as the team manager, the obedient corporate stooge who tells it as it is but still cares about his team, trying to prevent an injured Jonathan E from going back out to probable death during the final game (the New York manager noticeably succeeding in doing the same for one of his players). Fantastic music too, the classical influence contrasting with the sheer brutality of the game. And it is still shocking after all these years, the scene where the injured player slides down the rink leaving a bloody trail behind him still makes you cringe. You're so happy that Jonathan spares the final New York player and then goes on to score the final point, to him it's still all about the game rather than the violence. No offence to Star Wars but it rather killed the more thoughtful sci-fi we had in the 1970s, Silent Running, Dark Star, Logan's Run, THX 1138, Westworld, Solaris, The Omega Man etc. The only bad thing is Jonathan's trip to the the computer bank in Geneva which is utterly baffling.
