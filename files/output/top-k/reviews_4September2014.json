[{"date":"4 September 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" 'Mystery Men' is a half-hearted comedy featuring a lot of good actors put through the motions of a bloated special effects light show. The best dialogue in the movie comes from the personalities of the actors themselves. This is the kind of movie that is best to watch on video with your remote in hand to fast-forward through the boring parts.The story Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear), the hero of Champion City has cleaned up the city of crime and his sponsers are getting restless for something new. He comes up with the idea of paroling his nemesis Dr. Casanova Frankenstein (that it NOT a typo) so that the doctor can cause some crime, the Captain can save the day and have his rep restored.The problem is that Frankenstein kidnaps the Captain. So it's up a band of second rate superheroes to spring into action. They include Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller) who 'gets Pompeii' when there is trouble; The blue raja (Hank Azaria) who hurls forks and spoon (His partners helpfully suggest that he try wearing blue instead lime green) and The Shoveler (William H. Macy) who fights with garden tools.When they see their opportunity to make a name for themselves they assign new team members which include The Bowler (Janaene Garofalo) who hurls mean bowling ball which contains her late father's skull, Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell) who can only turn invisible when no one is looking and The Spleen (Paul Reuben) who . . . um . . . well . . . vents it. My favorite though is The Sphinx (Wes Studi) a Zen Yoda-like trainer who dispenses hilarious saying like 'You must be a wolf pack, not a six pack' and 'You must lash out with every limb like an octopus who plays the drums' There are long stretches of dead screen time with no laughs. The fight scenes have a lot of energy dispensed with little payoff. The major scenes involving the special effects don't work.I wish that the movie had kept it simple. There are a lot of small moments in this movie that are brilliant. I especially liked Macy's line 'We've got a date with destiny and it looks like she's ordered the lobster'. I loved an early recruitment scene, which includes characters like The Waffler (who fights with waffle irons) and The PMS Avenger (who only works once a month).A curious thing happens when people talk about a movie like 'Mystery Men'. They will tell you what was wrong with it but then quickly tell you about a scene that works. This is the kind of middle-of-the-row comedy that people defend but do not endorse.

How it remained 'stand-alone' for so long is a mystery to me. I can't believe so bright Hollywood money-man didn't think of doing a sequel waaay sooner than twenty-three years later. And, as we all know, how many times are sequels even nearly as good as the original? Not many. But Carrie 2 doesn't totally disgrace itself.Carrie 2 felt a bit like a 'part remake\/part sequel.' It was certainly good to see the one of the main actresses come back for the sequel - it helped bridge the gap quite nicely. The 'new' plot basically recycles the old one. If you don't know what happens - basically, bullied girl gets revenge on her tormentors through her uncontrollable telekinetic powers.Anyway, the film is actually pretty good. No, it'll never recapture the 'shock value' of the original as you basically know what's coming, but it's an enjoyable horror-yarn nonetheless. If you liked the original, you shouldn't feel too aggrieved at someone cashing in on the Carrie-name after two decades. And, if you haven't seen the first one, you should get what's going on without feeling you've missed out.http\/\/thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"4 September 2014","score":"","review":" The first film was a classic.
