comedy to scenes of brutality, but these shifts work and don't seem to jarring. Tom Cruise may get top billing, and he is excellent, but this is Brad Pitt's character Louis's story, he gets the most screen time, he's the one we follow throughout the movie, Kirsten Dunst also appears in the movie, she's good as well but her character sometimes comes off as a bit of a brat, there's also some strange, slightly sinister stuff they toy around with, seemingly, despite her child-like appearance she is considerable older, this is of course a well known excuse often seen in anime to play around with some unseemly stuff, the movie skips around it, but thankfully never goes for that. The story is good, granted, not a whole lot of stuff happens, but the actors are so good, they keep you invested in the plot, there are some surprises throughout that are genuinely...well, surprising, shocking even, and I won't spoil them. There are just a few minor unanswered questions after it's all over, but you don't feel annoyed, it's a satisfying movie, if you're one of those who believe Tom Cruise is gay, then you're probably going to pay extra attention to some scenes, to be fair he doesn't only go after boys, but women as well. doesn't matter, he's a good actor, and he is really good here. I liked the movie, when one character seems to be killed off, the movie slips a little, but then you get an awesome revenge scene later on.

Believe it or not, but today Mario Bros. has surpassed some praised blockbusters as of writing this, I found out that the Super Mario Bros. ranks at #3.504 by popularity on the movie meter here at IMDb, which makes it more popular than some 1993 blockbusters (Cliffhanger ranks only #3.813, The Pelican Brief only #3.629), more popular than some classics (Gigi ranks only #6.985, Mrs. Minniver is not even it the top 10.000 list) and even more popular than some recent movies that won the Academy Award for Best Picture, mind you (Ordinary People ranks only at #3.585, Driving Miss Daisy only at #4.833 and not even The Last Emperor managed to score higher than #3.852). If we look at some of the highest grossing movies in 1993, like Cliffhanger or In the Name of the Father, we can find out that their message boards here at IMDb are dead, while the board here at Mario Bros. is still alive and active. Obviously the Mario Bros. authors must have done at least something right when the people are still talking about the movie in 2012.The movie is fun even today, despite the not so favorably viewed step to show the Mario Bros. in an edgier, darker version where the heroes find themselves in some sort of a North Korea kind of world where everything was wasted in mismanagement and plundered just to suit the maniacal demands of king Koopa, whereas the cast in fantastic, from Bob Hoskins, through Dana Kaminski up to Dennis Hopper who seems to almost match his bad guy image from Blue Velvet, and the story has so many clever references to other movies (Koopa's line about loving mud because it is so clean and dirty at the same time is an obvious reference to a similar line about the desert said by the hero in Lawrence of Arabia) or simply spoofs some mainstream clichés, such as the constant bad language in some movies (Egg-sucker!). The de-evolution chamber is still one of the most fascinating bad guy inventions ever put on screen, even more inspiring than the dip from Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and if it was used in some horror movie it would have been probably praised as the scariest thing ever, you really get the idea what kind of a joint they are running.Even the detractors have to admit that the editing was top notch, the story flows smoothly and never drags for a second, that the score was spot on and that the set-design and costumes were perfect (nominated even for the Saturn Award). The long zoom in on Daisy in the castle in the fog still gives me the chills when I see it, while so many jokes seem to be lost on the grumpy viewers who tend to ignore them (Old Lady You know, boys, this is a really rough neighborhood. You really shouldn't be wandering around without a weapon. You got one? - Luigi ...No. - Old Lady ...All right...(brandishes a cattle-prod-like weapon) Get 'em up, suckers!). I really wish someone would publish all the deleted scenes. The only thing I don't really like are the first 3 minutes and the last 3 minutes of the movie, since they seem rushed, and the fact that Mario and Luigi should have worn their overalls from the start. Yet, if you watch the movie with an open mind, you will be surprised at how it can work and how every movie works that way if you give it a chance.

The de-evolution chamber is still one of the most fascinating bad guy inventions ever put on screen, even more inspiring than the dip from Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and if it was used in some horror movie it would have been probably praised as the scariest thing ever, you really get the idea what kind of a joint they are running.Even the detractors have to admit that the editing was top notch, the story flows smoothly and never drags for a second, that the score was spot on and that the set-design and costumes were perfect (nominated even for the Saturn Award). The long zoom in on Daisy in the castle in the fog still gives me the chills when I see it, while so many jokes seem to be lost on the grumpy viewers who tend to ignore them (Old Lady You know, boys, this is a really rough neighborhood. You really shouldn't be wandering around without a weapon. You got one? - Luigi ...No. - Old Lady ...All right...(brandishes a cattle-prod-like weapon) Get 'em up, suckers!). I really wish someone would publish all the deleted scenes. The only thing I don't really like are the first 3 minutes and the last 3 minutes of the movie, since they seem rushed, and the fact that Mario and Luigi should have worn their overalls from the start.

Believe it or not, but today Mario Bros. has surpassed some praised blockbusters as of writing this, I found out that the Super Mario Bros. ranks at #3.504 by popularity on the movie meter here at IMDb, which makes it more popular than some 1993 blockbusters (Cliffhanger ranks only #3.813, The Pelican Brief only #3.629), more popular than some classics (Gigi ranks only #6.985, Mrs. Minniver is not even it the top 10.000 list) and even more popular than some recent movies that won the Academy Award for Best Picture, mind you (Ordinary People ranks only at #3.585, Driving Miss Daisy only at #4.833 and not even The Last Emperor managed to score higher than #3.852).

Calling it some sort of 'ahead of its time GLBT' classic or any sort of 'serious look' at anything is simply finding pearls among the dog doo.

That's because the title alone is interesting poetic, graceful, yet sinister. So you look it up, and the premise is more... dangerous... than the title even An FBI trainee confides in an incarcerated, cannibalistic murderer to catch another serial killer who skins women. Wow. That's heavy stuff- now how does it relate to lambs? And from there you're hooked. Some books don't make good film material. The Silence of the Lambs made a masterpiece.It's no secret- the film is extraordinary. One of only 3 films to win all the 'major' Oscars (and personally it's the best of them), 'Silence' practically started the modern dark-crime sub genre. From Seven to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, it can all be traced back to this, and with good reason. Based on excellent source material, which I finished yesterday and will draw on later, The Silence of the Lambs has been imitated, parodied and drawn from an impossible amount of times, but the original still stands on its own.I've already mentioned the exquisite plot, a great mystery, or thriller, or horror, or however you define it. A huge success of the film is its atmosphere, a very dark, draining world. This is achieved through dark colours, small sets, and a haunting score by Howard Shore that is equally influential, even in his own later work like Seven. It never takes the credit, but constantly accompanies the action.The Academy will tell you how excellent the characters are. At the forefront are the two winners, Clarice and Lecter. I believe Clarice to be arguably the greatest female heroine ever. She is strong and determined, work-oriented in her male dominated world. But at the same time she can show vulnerability and fear. It's amazing. I'm glad the sub-subplot of her mild romance was removed. Hannibal Lecter. There's a name you won't forget, nor a face you'll forget. It's all been said before Anthony Hopkins delivered one of the most legendary performances in cinema history as the charming and terrifying doctor. His facial expressions, his voice, his choice of words, even his posture. A perfect example of quality over quantity. The scenes these two share are very intense, with closeups. Lots of closeups.There's three other characters worth mentioning Crawford, Starling's mentor, is the likable and work focused head of the Buffalo Bill case. While he suffered the most loss in transfer from book to screen, as well as the whole plot of his wife being removed, he is still likable, due to an honest performance. On the other hand, Chilton, the asylum doctor, is an absolute slimeball. He's a great character, but something about the portrayal is off. Lastly, and the most important one, Buffalo Bill, Jame Gumb. He is the single most terrifying, creepiest villain in fiction. He was scary in the book and in the film he'll make your stomach churn. The voice and look, and unbelievably freaky, scary, disturbing dance mark a CRIMINALLY underrated performance by Ted Levine, who I cannot see in any other role now. He IS Buffalo Bill.The first time I saw the film, one key thing I remember is the patience the film exhibits. Coarse language is used only when necessary, but more importantly is how violence and gore is treated. The book wasn't a gorefest, but there were ample opportunities for shock violence, like the picture of the nurse or the autopsy room. For the most part, the visual is held back, until that one sequence, and you'll know what I mean, when everything is gruesomely put on the table, and into your mind is burned several terrible images. Great films have patience, and this is a great film.I usually don't read source material, but I had to read this one. I'm not used to it, so I don't know how much films usually cut out from their books. But 'Silence' is very true to the core of the novel. The screenplay cuts out what you might expect character development and history, as well as Bella, Klaus, the media and Southern angles, and unfortunately (for me) Barney and Bill's story. The film is short, just under 2 hours, but even with these shortcuts maintains the slow pace of the book. However the adaptation is very faithful to the book, and rises above in some places.Some scenes are handled much better with visuals. Lecter's cell is much better with glass instead of bars and nylon mesh (?), and the key sequence in Tennessee is spectacular, with the violence. And the ambulance, let to the imagination in the book, leaves viewers is absolute terror.Bookended by a great opening and closing, The Silence of the Lambs marks a milestone in film.

I thought that the storyline and premise were OK but a bit cliché' even for way bay then. However if you are willing to over look the terrible dialog, the almost comic level of tragedy, and some bad acting this is a good movie to watch if you are bored and having nothing else to do. Or if you are in the mood to play something in the background while your doing week end house work. I am not saying it's a terrible movie but the first 15 minutes of the movie made me laugh. I am guessing it was meant to shock the viewer with it's tragic car accidents but it felt more like I was watching Porky's than a serious movie.

I won't tell you exactly how it works here; but needless to say, it's a pretty cunning way of keeping the boys flying.

I really don't want to say too much, it's one of those you have to see for yourself to get a grasp of. Also, the Spoiler Police will be selling off all my stuff.This is an interesting film that has a lot to say about many things; not least war and capitalism. I won't go into the political questions it raises, but needless to say the point is put across quite forcibly. Decent performances all round, particularly from Alan Arkin as Capt. John Yossarian; he did a first rate job here! Honourable mentions go to; Martin Balsam as Col. Cathcart, Richard Benjamin as Maj. Danby, Art Garfunkel as Capt. Nately, Jack Gilford as Dr. 'Doc' Daneeka, Buck Henry as Lt. Col. Korn, Bob Newhart as Maj. Major Major, Anthony Perkins as Chaplain Capt. A.T.

It's all very well shot, but I'm afraid it suffers from having the feel of some 'Frat-house' comedy which didn't really endear it to me too much. That aside, I did find parts of it were quite compelling although I did struggle to have much empathy with any of the characters&#x85; even the lead. For its day though I thought it was quite groundbreaking and quite an eye-opener (in more ways than one).

Wells novel 'War of the Worlds' and this film, 'AI'. 'AI' is such deeply thoughtful science fiction that you sort of wonder what could have possibly gone wrong with his earlier science fiction works. every thing here is not only conceived with intelligence and true scientific speculation, but he is completely in control as a filmmaker and writer. i guess Speiberg is just sort of unpredictable because he is simply human and flawed. ain't we all.most sci-fi, especially these days on sci-fi channels, can be aggrandized silly fantasy with very little serious speculation about what real science embodies. even a fantasy writer such as Ray Bradbury felt a lot of current sci-fi was more concerned with comic book silliness than actual science. mostly i feel the same. a lot of what you see is about some corny super hero or aliens and monsters. very little seems inspired by any kind of plausible reasoning or speculation. but when it is good, sci-fi, even when currently impossible, can inspire the imagination to develop impossibilities into reality. that is why the nature of sci-fi fantasy is so crucial to development of human thought. when done right, sci-fi , even though speculative and often impossible, can stimulate the imagination to stretch itself to create science possibilities.there is so much to discuss and recommend about Speiberg's brilliant 'AI' that there isn't enough room on IMDb to give it analytical justice. not only is 'AI' probing science theory, it is also a journey of discovery into the very nature of human thought and the very nature and motivation of organic intelligence.this movie is also some of the most complete science fiction cinema ever conceived. not only does it boast some cutting, ahead of it's time CGI FX and spectacular fantasy visions, it also has a well written script and excellent acting and genuinely moving dramatic emotions.the acting is of the highest demand. Haley Joel Osment is brilliant beyond his years and not only establishes himself as one of cinema's most memorable child actors along the merits of Shirley Temple, Jodie Foster and Tatum O'Neal, he might possibly have given cinema one of it's best performances period. i always thought the rugrat was pretty impressive in the excellent 'Sixth Sense', but this film most definitely cements it. Jude Law also gives a beautifully well thought performance as a cybernetic gigolo.this film is not just simple pure gold, it's essential to the development of science thought, ethical reasoning, and to the human race in general. unless you have seen 'AI' and given it serious consideration, you can't possibly progress your human experience. it could be one of the most relevant human experiences outside of religious thought. i just can't believe sometimes that a good majority of people can't see or access the importance of this film.the parallels this film makes with the 'Pinocchio' story are profoundly disturbing and often nightmarish, but keenly insightful connections and appropriately analogous. this is in fact somewhat of a 'Pinocchio' fable but without Collodi's demeaning, moralizing judgments. William Hurt is even on hand as a sort of tortured Geppetto figure desperately wishing his creation life and humanness.in fact, this film tackles the folly of moralizing judgment as witnessed in the bitter displacement of organic, human beings who wage a sort of class warfare at the expense of hapless cybernetics in the horrifying 'Flesh Fair' sequence which indicts human cruelty and the essence of scape goating blame. a very human response and emotion when helpless.look, i'm not saying that actual artificial intelligence is any more possible than hovercraft vehicles, warp speed, time travel, or any other of the impossibilities explored in science fiction films, but as in the case of '2001' and it's intelligent computer system 'HAL', it's speculation that warrants consideration.if anyone reads this review and has not experienced this important and poignant cinema masterwork of analysis of the condition of existence, i suggest you see it for the sake of your very humanity. it's a imperative fictional experience that can prove to be quite rewarding. you may in fact, get a minor glimpse into the mind of God and the explanation of existence. let this film guide you to conscious enlightenment. and yes, i'm completely serious.

Many people dismiss those films, mostly because they consider them to be only for kids. In fact, it is not only Disney films Many good animation films are ignored and labeled as kid's stuff, disregard of the quality of the histories or the visual beauty of them. Even in the recent year, with the success of cartoons such as The Simpsons, South Park, King of the Hill and even Family Guy (Though I hate that show), animation is still considered a minor genre, with the children always being considered as the main target of it.

Basically Jack Walsh (Golden Globe nominated Robert De Niro) used to be a cop in Chicago, before he was framed by a criminal he was after, he now makes a living as a bounty hunter in Los Angeles, i.e. bringing in people for arrest. Bail bondsman Eddie Moscone (Joe Pantoliano) wants him to bring in Jonathan Mardukas aka 'The Duke' (Beethoven's Charles Grodin), an accountant who embezzled $15 million from Las Vegas mobster Jimmy Serrano (Dennis Farina), and if Moscone doesn't get him back within five days he loses the bond he gave to Mardukas and he loses his business. This is obviously the midnight run of the title, but of course it is no easy journey as Jack is forced to take Jonathan by car and train, as the accountant has a fear of flying. As they travel using various land transports they realise they are being pursued, by two sides, the cops and FBI who are after Jack to get to his boss, and the gangsters after Jonathan for his swindling. Jack has demanded $100,000 for this job, but Moscone is getting increasingly irritated that he is not arriving on the deadline they originally planned, and that time is running out, so he has sent rival bounty hunter to Jack, Marvin Dorfler (John Ashton). Dorfler does manage to cancel the card Jack uses to pay and get around, making the journey even more difficult to continue with lack of cash, but they just about get by, thanks to Jonathan's clever conning, and the fact that they have a police badge to use. Jonathan does try a couple of times to escape, but slowly he finds empathy and friendship with Jack, who even though grouchy and uninterested in conversation with him does seem to slowly like him as well. Jack reveals he plans to retire after this last job so that he can open his own coffee shop, and the two men on the run do get to know each other well enough to trust each other in the chase and very close call situations. In the end, after some complications, the gangsters caught, and the FBI and police, led by Alonzo Mosely (Yaphet Kotto), the man Jack has been impersonating constantly, allowing them to go, Jack does get Jonathan to Los Angeles, but he lets him go, and Jonathan leaves Jack with $300,000 from the money he stole. Also starring Richard Foronjy as Tony Darvo, Robert Miranda as Joey, Jack Kehoe as Jerry Geisler and Bruce Almighty's Philip Baker Hall as Sidney. De Niro is good being the moody, swearing bounty hunter, Grodin gets many giggles as the simple but often helpful man he is taking, and the supporting stars do their bits as well, it works as both a bickering eventually liking buddy movie and a road trip movie, and there are plenty of action and funny moments to keep you watching, a fun comedy thriller. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy\/Musical. Very good!
