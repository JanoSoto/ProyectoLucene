I don't regret seeing it, but it is not good. I, for one, wouldn't call it bad. But I can see why others would.Patch Adams is based on the true story of a zany doctor of the same name who broke all the rules and used humour to treat his patients. Aside from loving Robin Williams, this movie has a great premise. When people are terminally ill will little hope for survival, that's depressing. Luckily, Patch Adams comes in and makes the death less painful. Maybe I used poor word choice, but you get the idea.The movie opens up with Williams in a mental institution and it is unclear why he is there because he is seemingly normal. After seeing that he has a knack for making fellow patients happy, he enrols in medical school. Patch just wants to help people, only people in their third year and above can actually do the hands-on practise. So Patch breaks all the rules and becomes a clown for the hospital patients to enjoy. When he is being funny for this sick cancer children, they are enchanted by something glorious entering their lives. I personally didn't find it funny, but the whole concept was great.The hospital likes him, but the school doesn't as he is constantly disobeying procedures. As he uses his comedy more often, the realism tends to slip. Hospitals are full of grouchy and mentally ill people. Sometimes, humour doesn't work with certain people. I know that if Patch were trying to use his goofy comedy on me that I wouldn't like it. That's the problem with this Patch uses too much goofy kiddie humour. He builds a free hospital in the wilderness and it is not shown very well. He eventually sees that his humour is not 100% useful, but people love him anyway. Good thing some sense was knocked into him, but it was too late! As I said, the movie has a good concept but is not executed well. I wasn't underwhelmed, I really do think that this movie was simply an empty bore. Plus, the movie isn't funny which is a shocker. The only thing remotely funny was when Patch entertains the children. He isn't an out of control wild man and that's why he isn't funny, Robin Williams was just given a blah script. And that brings me to the star of the film the late great Robin Williams. He does a great job of acting. He shows a wide range of emotions and the audience gets to know that character well. That is the only thing good in the movie that is well executed.I liked it and I didn't like it. ","genre":null},{"date":"26 October 2015","score":"","review":" I saw Patch Adams long ago.

Between acting, directing, and so much more, he has earned a position as one of the preeminent figures of England. You probably know him best from his role as John Hammond in Jurassic Park. If you are older or a film buff, you also know him from the classic film The Great Escape (an interesting move that I will have to review at some point). I hope he rests in peace. He lived a good long life. I hope he had no real regrets. You know you lived for a long time when you don't die until twenty after you played an old man in a film.But of all his accomplishments, his greatest is directed this classic about one of the most important men in the twentieth century. Gandhi is not a perfect movie. It wastes too much time on unimportant topics and does not go into as harsh realities as it should, considering its wide scope. But it is number forty four in my top one hundred films for a few reasons one, it is the definitive image on how to do a wide-ranging biopic, as well as the definitive image on one of the world's most important men; two, it is one of the grandest movies in history, one with a scale nothing short of extraordinary, a scale that will stick in your mind long after you see it, a scale that evokes the same emotions in the viewer as one imagines were felt by Gandhi; three, it is brilliantly acted on all fronts, particularly by the man who plays Gandhi, the great Ben Kingsley, perhaps proving the adage that Brits make the best actors; and four, it takes the watcher on a journey, churning their emotions up and down like a boat on the stormy open seas, leaving them different and changed and in all venues, satisfied.The film begins with Gandhi getting shot. This is a rather dark way to start what is ultimately an uplifting movie, but it is a good decision if one is to think about it all of Gandhi's work is against the backdrop of racism and violence and crude, ignorant anger, and this depiction of this cold, callous, resentful act establishes the backdrop of the film, against which we see all the positive, progressive events take place. It is a good way to draw the reader into the story and put them firmly in the world of the film, a decision that becomes even sharper when you think about the fact that this movie is a historical epic, the sort of movie that many people could easily tune out of unless you give them a reason to stay awake. This film certainly does.It is the same trick that LoA (one of my ten favorite films of all time) plays at its start. Well... calling it a trick would be a bit of a misnomer. It's a classical framing device, one that has been used for centuries. I don't even know if it's trying to serve the functions I described in the last paragraph. But that doesn't mean it does not serve them well.It must be noted that this film is a British production. Such is obvious if you read what I've above written or even watched the film itself, but it is important to note. If you know anything about world history, you know that the British owned India for most all of the colonial era. This is something I could go into for pages on end. But I don't have the space or the time. So I will simply say that this is the best of a series of 80s films that could be considered almost an apology letter to India.In any case, it is one of the most evocative and emotional and moving epics. When you watch Gandhi talk, you don't feel that you are in the cinema or in the comfort of your bedroom. You feel like you're on the march with one of the world's greatest leaders in some of his greatest moments. It's like someone reaches into where you are and pulls you into the screen. Of course, in some ways, it's even better than that, for you get orchestral swells and fine direction. It charges you up.As a historical film, it succeeds. If you want a detailed, every-moment-laid-out account, go watch some documentaries. Seriously; there are good ones out there. Films are supposed to, above all else, evoke emotion. So, in the case of a historical movie, they are supposed to evoke the emotions of the era and its events. This film does that. You feel the twists and turns of the difficulties and stresses of the time. You don't just feel for Gandhi because he is the 'good' guy going up against the 'evil' that is racism and violence and disunity. You also feel for him because he you see his vision for a brighter and more prosperous India and world and you see it be attacked at every turn.What I like most about this film is that it does not shy away from the waning years of his life and their disappointments. Yes, he succeeded in many things, not least of which in getting India its independence. But the country was broken into two nations that continue to have bad blood to this day. Nothing exemplifies this more than the ending. We see the beginning scene once more, where he gets shot. But then we are treated to a quote of his, one with which I will close out this review When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love has always won. There have been tyrants, and murderers, and for a time they can seem invincible, but in the end they always fall. Think of it. Always.

Which King hates. but Kubrick was a gifted director who knew what he was doing and he was a perfectionist which drove the cast and crew of this movie crazy. but Kubrick never lost sight of the story he wanted to tell. in the novel King explains that the Overlook is a large psychic vampire a large battery feeding off of the people there who had Psychic abilities . Making the Overlook a large battery that stores and contains the most emotional psychic moments of its existence. Happiness ,Death,Love , violence. all of these things go on and on in the Overlook . but in Kubrick's nothing about the Overlook is explained except in the barest of details .but that is more then enough. Here in the movie less is more. And while the Shining is Kubrick's movie it belongs to Jack Nicholson. while in the book the slide into madness is supposed to be subtle for Jack Torrance. In this movie he seems cheese and crackers right from the start which is fun to watch as you realize the cheese has slid off his crackers and he is dangerous . The best bit is the scene that leads to the staircase. Wendy stop swinging the bat Wendy..as he moves in to kill her in a moment of comic timing. Nicholson makes the movie his own.

In the novel Grady kills himself long after his family he kills himself by shotgun because he has broken his leg falling down the stairs . To me the most horror filled moment is when you think about the little girls being killed by a ax. while one little girl looks on and sees her sister being killed by her father and knowing she is next. Does she run ? does she hide ? can you imagine the horror she must have felt knowing her sister was being chopped to pieces by their father and their mother was already dead. and she was next. That's the one point in the movie that gets me every time and with every viewing. That's how you know its a great movie. film making of the finest kind. And after seeing that and letting your imagination run wild with little scenes like the one I described . You can forgive Kubrick for his butchering King's novel because he did what he sets out to do. Telling King's story from a different view point. And scaring the daylights out of us .

The screenplay written by Allan Scott and Chris Bryant is adapted from a short story of the same name written by Daphne du Maurier. Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland respectively play Laura and John Baxter, a couple struggling to get over the grief of losing their daughter Christine when she accidentally drowned to death. They move to Venice when John gets commissioned to restore a church. There they come across two sisters, one of them being blind. The blind sister who claims to be psychic tells Laura that she can see Christine and is in touch with her, their dead daughter.'Don't Look Now' is one of those films that will divide audiences all around the world. Some will absolutely love it, while some will hate it big time. This is because Nicolas Roeg's style is very unconventional and on the first viewing can be a bit unsettling. Although I haven't read the original short story that this film is based on, but I can easily say that the film is an artistic work with an identity of its own. It is very visual. In the film's very first sequence, Roeg pretty much summarises what the film will explore. There are infinite jump-cuts, numerous flashbacks and flash-forwards and other various visual tricks which Roeg uses to make the film extremely rich visually. The colour red is of paramount importance. This film has a creepy cold European vibe borne out of isolation which reminded me of Polanski's 'The Tenant'. There are certain shots in the film which will stay with me always due to their disturbing and unsettling nature like the shot where the blind psychic sister Heather gets introduced to the audience for the first time and we see her reflection on the three mirrors all next to each other or the famous shot of the red hooded figure turning back to reveal her face to John.One of the most important elements of the film is the way in which Roeg shoots Venice. This is a city which is renowned for its simplistic beauty and romantic aura. But quite to the contrary, Roeg makes Venice look desolate, scary and worn out. The narrow lanes are confusing and Jack and Laura constantly lose their way. This is essential to the theme, because I believe the desolate weary Venice represents the state of John and Laura's minds. They just can't get over the grief of losing their daughter. Their minds have become as weary, dark and lifeless as the Venice that they are residing in. But Laura comes into contact with the two sisters and she decides to believe the supposedly psychic blind sister when she says Christine is happy and well. Laura decides to show faith and as a result receives at least some mental satisfaction. But the rational John refuses to give in to the claims of the psychic and refuses to recognise that he himself might be psychic. As a result he goes on wallowing in misery and guilt, as he clearly still blamed himself for Christine's death. This refusal to show faith in the end leads to his sad death. I truly believe 'Don't Look Now' can be seen as a companion piece to 'The Exorcist' as both are films that explore faith. I think both films show that irrespective of whether you believe in God and the afterlife or not, having faith can actually give you closure and give you mental strength to move on from some form of grief and start living again. John refused to believe the psychic sister. So while Laura received some sort of closure, John continued to suffer with guilt all on his own. The red hooded figure who turns out to be the murderer represents the grief mixed with guilt that John just can't get rid of no matter where he goes and in the end this grief gets the better of him and kills him.Another important aspect of the film is the gender divide. The women are far more open to the possibility of the supernatural and the godly, while the men are consumed by their rational thoughts. The bishop of the church that John is supposed to restore is seen in the film to question God's plans and God's priorities. John doesn't pay any heed to his wife's requests to be open to the claims of the sisters. Apart from Nicolas Roeg's creative and inventive style of storytelling, one has to admire the acting. Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie are brilliant. They actually looked like a couple. You can see that they love each other, but you can also grasp the sadness and the distance that has grown between them after the great loss. This duality in their relationship gets underlined by Roeg through brilliant editing in the infamous sex scene which gets inter-cut with shots of both of them getting dressed afterwards on their own without any chitchat. We witness the passion in the sex, but at the same time we witness how both are somewhat distant and how both are still overwhelmed by Christine's memories. Hilary Mason also has to be admired for her disturbing and creepy portrayal of the blind psychic Heather.'Don't Look Now' is a brilliantly crafted psychological horror film. I think like 'The Exorcist', the main theme running through it is faith. Nicolas Roeg does a great job in making a film that is genuinely disturbing as well as endearing as the director clearly loves the two main characters who are clearly troubled and Roeg has respect for both of them.

Terrific performances sadly aren't enough to save a boring movie, and I wouldn't recommend True Crime to anyone. A journalist comes across new evidence that helps a man on death row.

The Russians are carrying out a series of tests out in the Atlantic when their reactor ends up badly damaged which results in several crew members being badly exposed to radiation. As a result Captain Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford) and his crew must put everything they learnt into practice to prevent a catastrophic nuclear incident from occurring.I knew very little about this film when I started watching it, but quickly became interested when I learnt that it was 38 years after the events had taken place that anyone was able to talk about what had happened - the fall of Communism was what allowed this story to be told.The issue I had with this film is that it really only has three components to it; there's all the drills and training that we see (early on with Neeson and his crew) then later out at the sea with Ford in charge of the mission. Then there is the failure of the reactor and then we have the final sequence of events and the ending. Bigelow stages the action well and the various close ups, claustrophobia and obvious pain that we see from some of the men did help to at least keep me involved in what she's put in front of me. The problem I had with this film is that it was a tad repetitive - the drills and training kept me involved for about 30 minutes, but when you're seeing the same thing for about an hour it does start to get a bit boring. The second half focuses on the reactor breaking down and again it adds excitement and intensity, but again only in short bursts. If you have 120 minutes worth of film that only focuses on two things then you really need to make these two things compelling, exciting, intense and\/or entertaining for at least the majority of the time. Sadly, K-19; The Widowmaker doesn't do this consistently enough making it a very much hit and miss affair.There are some positives here and firstly it has to be said that Neeson and Ford were both very good here (even though their Russian accents were a bit dodgy) both men play-off well against each other and the power struggle that they face against each other make their scenes interesting to watch. Bigelow's direction is superb, the cinematography is excellent and the action sequences are framed together very well. The final sequence of events are also very moving.K-19 The Widowmaker isn't a bad film, but it is a little repetitive and drawn out and for those reasons it isn't entirely successful across its 133 minute running time.

It reads mostly as a homage to crazy visionaries, people whom Herzog clearly identifies with. Based on a true story, but taking considerable liberties with the truth, this film tells the story of one Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald (Klaus Kinski, who is terrific), an opera mad Irish entrepreneur living in Iquitos, in the Peruvian Amazon in the late 19th century. Fitzgerald was called Fitzcarraldo by the locals, who found his original name difficult to pronounce. A plan by him to build a railway crossing the Andes had failed, and his next project of making ice wasn't going anywhere. After a talk with a rubber baron, he came up with a new plan to exploit rubber in a very remote part of the Amazon rain forest and with the profits made from the venture build an opera house in Iquitos. For that purpose, he buys a river boat with money from the madam of a brothel (played by Claudia Cardinale) who sympathizes with him. He hires a rowdy crew to accompany him in his boat to his jungle tract, including a nearsighted captain, a drunken cook and a giant Indian called Cholo. Now, the area where he had the concession to exploit rubber trees could only be accessed through a river with impossible rapids to cross. But a navigable river ran nearby, and he came up with the idea of carrying the whole boat between the rivers with the help of nearby Indians. Only problem, those Indians were hostile head hunters, known to kill previous trespassers in the area. And to make things worse, the terrain where the portage of the boat took place was not plain but was rather a steep hill (apparently, the real Fitzcarraldo did carry a boat through a hill, only he disassemble first into pieces, and later assemble it back in the nearby river).In a superb extender scene, Fitzcarraldo manages to get the Indians to carry the boat to the other river, but after wards, things start unraveling badly. But just when the film looks like is going to have a downbeat ending, Herzog pulls out a surprisingly heartwarming finale, which I won't reveal here but in which Fitzcarraldo partly fulfills his dreams - though some reviewers find it anticlimactic compared with the scene of the boat going up the hill.Originally Jason Robards was going to play Fitzcarraldo, with Mick Jagger playing his sidekick. Eventually, Robards got a tropical disease during the filming and had to bow out on medical advice, and Jagger also abandoned the shooting due to his musical commitments with the Rolling Stones (by the way, there is some footage around the Internet showing Robards and Jagger playing their characters and is clear that they would have been dreadful in the movie). Herzog decided to call Kinski, who doesn't look Irish at all, but had the right crazy intensity for the character, while writing off Jagger's role.

Reports say that Robert Redford, who proposed the idea, fell out with director Rob Reiner after Reiner wanted to make Sorkin's script focus on politics instead of romance. Well if that's true, Reiner should have buffed up Sorkin's script a little more. This was the least convincing political movie I've ever seen. It focuses on President Michael Douglas and his romance with lobbyist Annette Bening. These two are thrown together so quickly and Sorkin hopes like mad that you forget that they've only met once or twice. While the idea of a dating President is intriguing enough for a movie, the execution was poor here, mostly because despite Reiner's focus on politics, the romance always wins in the eyes of the characters. In one charming yet excruciating scene, Douglas tells his advisors (who probably have urgent information) to wait while he orders flowers. Throughout the movie, his complete lack of political savvy at realising that his romance is not just his business had me almost screaming for impeachment. Bening is no better &#x96; we are told she is one of the highest paid lobbyists in Washington, but she spends almost all of her screen time flirting with the President and creating an enormous conflict of interest. Just because Sorkin's script acknowledges is does not make it okay. The only evidence we see of her skill are one-sided conversations with Congressmen that end on her terms with her desired outcome. Without any hurdles to her objective, we just have to take Sorkin's word for it that she's good. Its not all bad &#x96; Reiner's direction and Sorkin's script are both passable, creating moments that can be both dramatic and charming. A bantering phone conversation between Douglas and an unsuspecting Bening is irresistible. There are at least two very evocative monologues delivered during the film, as to be expected by Sorkin. The light and soaring musical score is used perfectly to create reverence for Oval Office and White House in general.Douglas is charming but I never bought him as a President, especially when placed next to the irreplaceable Martin Sheen (who would go on to play a far superior President Bartlett in the West Wing) as his Chief of Staff A. J. MacInernay (say that awful name five times fast). Michael J. Fox is excellent and delivers an exceptional performance when having a showdown with the President later in the film. An absolutely charming Bening is probably the film's highlight. My biggest problem with the American President is the completely biased portrayal of Republicans led by Richard Dreyfuss. Sorkin has never pretended to be tolerant of right wing opinion, but this sinks to a new low. The group sits around like a bunch of one-percenters, cigars and scotch in hand and gleefully rub their hands together like they're planning to kidnap Princess Peach. The group run rampant with nothing but negativity (as Sorkin perceives they do in real life) and then slink off defeated as soon as Douglas puts them in their place. It makes for a rather pathetic set of antagonists, and is certainly not a very fair depiction either.Whilst I'm convinced that this version is far better than the Redford version we might have seen, the soppy and rushed romance winning over political story made The American President a far less enjoyable experience than I had hoped.

The teens here are interesting characters rather than the usual cardboard cutouts that are there just to annoy us until Freddy gleefully slaughters them. I actually liked most of these kids!

The Michael Myers Halloween theme has a big impact on this series as well as the camera techniques and special effects which are non-existent in these dumb money grabbing remakes.

I didn't even know they did a remake of #2( and that's what it is, #2) All I can say is the remake sucks. There is nobody in the remake that is a audience draw to begin with although I see some recognized 'filler' characters. Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance add tangible character to this version. I can see certain movies that are geared to a newer generation but there are many movies that anyone can relate to no matter when they were born. Why ruin a good thing when it ain't broke.

Having just slept with a call girl (Julie Delpy), he spends a night on the town with his dangerous friends. They all decide to rob a bank the following day. There is only one problem Zed's call-girl, Zoe, just happens to work at the bank which is to be robbed! I believe this film comes from the same guy who wrote Pulp Fiction, and the similarities are evident. Although the first half is a strange romance-turned-heist, the film gets increasingly violent as it carries on. This is very much the same style as Pulp Fiction. (Both also feature Eric Stoltz.) Julie Delpy is interesting here. Although she is more or less reduced to a secondary character, it is interesting how she was something of the it girl as far as French women in American movies were concerned. She was not the first or the last, but it seems that at any given time there is always one French actress who is the standard for appearing in American films.
