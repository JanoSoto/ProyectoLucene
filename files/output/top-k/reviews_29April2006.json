Lang brings subtle nuances to his characters to help us understand what drives and motivates them. We have a pretty good idea early on that Christopher Cross (Edward G. Robinson) is a meek bank clerk, but one doesn't see how truly desperate his life has become until he puts on that blasted apron to wash the dishes. Or how about the 'three on a match' superstition put to the test at his retirement dinner when Chris's boss lights his cigar, a quick aside shows him crossing his fingers to ward off fate.Art critic David Janeway had the perfect description of Kitty March (Joan Bennett) describing her as a Mona Lisa without the smile, a testament to her two faced nature. With boyfriend Johnny's (Dan Duryea) encouragement, Kitty plays Janeway along as well. How many boyfriends did Johnny think she could string along before the whole thing fell apart? With relatively little screen time, Rosalind Ivan portrays every man's worst nightmare in a wife, an Edith Bunker on steroids relentlessly hounding her husband into submission on a daily basis. One wonders if there could have been an ice pick in her future as well, although the re-appearance of her presumed dead husband was a slick table turn by Chris. However I'm not sure I can buy the presumption that the Cross marriage is automatically over just because Patch-Eye shows up; that matter wasn't satisfactorily resolved in my view, though fair enough for Chris to continue his foray into delusion.Though the movie doesn't start out that way, Chris winds up committing the perfect crime, with the inadvertent help of con man Johnny who winds up taking a death chair rap. It would have held up too, except for Chris's conscience. In a scene reminiscent of the Bogart\/Greenstreet conversation in the film Conflict, the seed of a killer's self destruction is planted by a detective who theorizes on the guilt of the criminal mind. By now, if one doesn't realize how hapless Chris has become, it should be crystal clear. The authorities don't believe his confession, and with the disembodied voices of Kitty and Johnny mocking him from the grave, Chris can't even successfully commit suicide. He has become one of film's biggest losers.Scarlet Street is a compelling journey into noir territory and holds up well after sixty years. Robinson, Bennett and Duryea are each successful in creating characters so pathetic that one can only stand at a distance and marvel at their performances. In that regard, the film, much like Chris's paintings, will give you a peculiar perspective.

Not every movie can be that. This is still good. It's not the kind of movie where everyone who watches it says Oh my gosh that was the best movie EVER I just have to watch it over and over again! But it's not the kind of movie where five minutes in you're wondering Uh, what is this crap? But after reading some other comments I'm going to try to respond to a few.He doesn't have the screen presence of the original!Of course it doesn't have real screen presence! It's a computer generated image. But the original was a guy in a rubber suit in a model city. That's about as fake as they come. At least this movie used real locations and put the monster in. Of course since people have nothing to base a fifty story lizard off of it looks real enough. The original is just a guy dressed as a lizard. He moves and acts like a person in a suit. This one actually acts like a giant lizard. If a lizard was fifty stories or so that's probably how it would act.Does he breathe fire or doesn't he?No! But do real lizards breathe fire? It's hard enough explaining how a fifty story lizard came to be. They don't need to complicate it anymore by having to explain fire breathing.How hard is it really to pronounce Tatopoulos?It's a joke people! A running gag. If you saw that and didn't hear how it's pronounced could you do better?The story is unrealistic.It's a movie about a giant lizard. How realistic is it supposed to be? John McClane gets through all of Die Hard with no shoes. Indiana Jones seems to single handedly defeat every single German that comes at him. Axel Foley can solve any crime in Detroit and Beverly Hills. Movies aren't made to be realistic. They're to be entertaining.He goes down way to easily.They seem to hit him with a lot before he actually goes down. Torpedoes, missiles, machine guns. He takes a lot of damage before he dies. Also I think he kind of gave up after all his kids were dead.All the baby Godzillas look like raptors.Alright I'll give you that one. The whole thing with the babies probably could have waited till a sequel to do. It does seem to drag on the movie a little longer than it really needed to be. It doesn't really have you looking at your watch waiting for it to end. The movie is action-packed enough so you're not thinking about the time too much.It's too much like Jurassic Park.You could say the same thing about Star Wars and Star Trek. But those two seem to get along fine.He only runs, he never fights.He has no weapons. He's an animal. Not a person. He could stomp on them I guess but that would probably make him an easier target. He's not stupid. If you were to start shooting things at your cat or dog and it hurt it would it attack you? Probably not. It would probably run from you.It's just not the original.Neither is The Mummy with Brendan Fraser. But for some reason that one's considered a great remake. Both pretty much do the same thing. They both took the basic idea of the original and applied it to a different situation. They couldn't just do exactly what the original did or you get just another Psycho remake. They took the idea of a lizard, enlarged by radiation, coming to modern day America, and how America tries to deal with it. People have seen all those campy monster flicks. You don't keep eating the same breakfast cereal every morning. You got to give audiences something different than what they expect.He doesn't destroy enough.What do you want him to do? Just walk around destroying everything he sees? He's not there to destroy the city. He's there to live, to make a nest. You don't go around destroying your household. He's trying to make New York his home, not a garbage dump. He could go around destroying everything, but for what reason? It would make no sense to have him mindlessly destroy everything.It's GINO (Godzilla In Name Only).LIGHTEN UP PEOPLE! If you really wanted to see a guy in a rubber suit attacking Tokyo then watch the Japanese movies. This is supposed to be different. It's supposed to not look like the original. If you want to see the Mummy as a well-known member of society then watch the Boris Karloff Mummy. If you want to see the Mummy turn into a wall of sand then watch the Brendan Fraser Mummy. If they did have a guy in a rubber suit you would all be complaining that It's just copying the original, it's not doing anything different.This is a great movie if you just give it the chance. So at least watch it once. It seems that it's just one of those where you either love it or you hate it. Don't go in expecting the original. The original is a classic in it's own right. It's a good action film that you can take your kids to without worrying about blood, gore, violence, language, etc. The worst part (violencewise) is the ending, which only shows Godzilla getting hit with missiles. Other than that it's pretty clean.It seems to me that there are plenty of people who do like this movie. I like this movie. I bought it. I would like to see a sequel.

I had heard that it was a classic horror\/thriller of the 90's so i brought it. I went home and watched it that night to find one of the best movies I have ever seen. you should go out and buy it for a lot more than that,(but don't because you know that the second you do you'll turn around and see it for cheaper and then hate yourself for being impatient.)I had also heard that it was gratuitously gory and violent, upon watching the film i was pleasantly surprised. In my opinion violence can be used to great effect, and also ,in my experience, films that have been certified '18' because of their violence are often over the top and unnecessary. For example 'Kill Bill' although I found it entertaining (to a point) you start to think that no character in the films life is important because they are being disembowelled left, right and centre, and as soon as you take that away, you take away the reality of it, because in real life every life matters and you cannot just chop through 88 people with a samurai sword. So i thought that this may perhaps be the case for Seven. I was, however, wrong. at points David Fincher used extreme violence but it works well and makes the audience root even more for Mills(Pitt) and Somerset(Freeman) because you want them to solve the crime and be done with this disgusting world (Morgan Freeman is retiring after the case, and Brad Pitt's wife wants to go back to the city they recently moved from).Another great thing about Seven is that not only does it thrill and disturb but it also makes you question the world that we live in. The film is set in the modern day, but in no particular place. It is a dark and grim city filled with crime and corruption, and it makes the audience really think about crime, helped along by Morgan Freemen who often talks about whether or not crime will stop, or will it go on for ever and why.The acting is brilliant, the contrast between Mills and Somerset, Somerset being the old, experienced cop on the verge of retirement and Mills, the hot-headed rookie. One of my favourite parts is when Morgan Freeman tells Pitt he should read up on the crimes, and gives him a list of books to get. Later we see a policeman handing the revision notes versions of the books (including 'Dante's Inferno') to Pitt.

For example 'Kill Bill' although I found it entertaining (to a point) you start to think that no character in the films life is important because they are being disembowelled left, right and centre, and as soon as you take that away, you take away the reality of it, because in real life every life matters and you cannot just chop through 88 people with a samurai sword.

I was, however, wrong. at points David Fincher used extreme violence but it works well and makes the audience root even more for Mills(Pitt) and Somerset(Freeman) because you want them to solve the crime and be done with this disgusting world (Morgan Freeman is retiring after the case, and Brad Pitt's wife wants to go back to the city they recently moved from).Another great thing about Seven is that not only does it thrill and disturb but it also makes you question the world that we live in. The film is set in the modern day, but in no particular place. It is a dark and grim city filled with crime and corruption, and it makes the audience really think about crime, helped along by Morgan Freemen who often talks about whether or not crime will stop, or will it go on for ever and why.The acting is brilliant, the contrast between Mills and Somerset, Somerset being the old, experienced cop on the verge of retirement and Mills, the hot-headed rookie.

Many women state that men can't openly watch this film and that men are closed minded to films like this. Others conclude people don't like this film because it's too explicit. Well let me be the first to say that, unlike the film makers, most human beings are intelligent people, specifically those commenting on this board(other than those that even consider this movie worthwhile). If you don't like explicit material, than most people naturally don't watch it. And if you are new to the genre, you're probably not starting with this film. Therefore we can conclude logically that most people seeing this film have experience with films by Lucio Fulci, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Gasper Noe, Alejandro Jodorosky... The difference, however between the above filmmakers and the makers of this film is that they offer intelligent, thought-out pieces that often work as metaphors of particular events. To say that this film is a metaphor of the way women feel towards a male dominated society is just ignorant.Some people say this film does not have a story, unfortunately this is not true. The film does have a story, a very simple revenge story that seemed to be written by aggrevated 8th graders. The directing in the film is insulting and it insults the other great film makers who spend long hours writing brilliant allegories and then translating through the film medium. This film, if anything, resembles that of a Troma film with explicit sex. The movie is almost laughably bad, trying to achieve a high status through publicity. The violence is, however, well done, and that does give the film some merits. But the inclusion of completely unthought sexual scenes ruins this immediately. It's not like people watching this film have not seen the act of sex before.When a movie goer goes to see a film, specifically one calling itself an art film, they expect to see fresh, thought-provoking material. What we have here is a mess. Unfortunately this movie clarifies that not everyone can make movies. Women who like this film and argue it to be revolutionary are missing the fact that there are good writer\/directors out there that touch on women rights much more thoughtfully. Apparently this film is supposed to deliver some sort of message, but in order to voice such a message, you must first demonstrate a level of respectable intelligence that would allow a viewer to value the opinion of the writer\/director. This film never comes close to accomplishing any level of respect and clearly the filmmakers lack any knowledge AT ALL in film-making(Other than the effects).

The message in this film is so ineffectively delivered that I think I have scene porn films that offer more insight into life than this film.Anyways, the only reason I felt compelled to comment on this film is due to the lack of people intelligently commenting on this film as a film. Nobody wants to hear that this film is bad because of the explicit nature and nobody wants to hear it is good on that account either. The moral of the story here is, just because of a film is cutting edge doesn't make it good. Hey look at Island of Death for example, that film was banned all over the place. Or even Cannibal Ferox, which offers nothing but gore. The only problem is, those films are designed to shock and entertain through the shocks, this movie tries to offer a deep message embeded in worthless shocks, just like IOD and CF.

Yes, it had silly and gross jokes at times and the parodies weren't as sharp as they could have been. But it WAS funny and it had parodies. This sequel started out about the same, but soon the parodies were dropped to make way for the Wayans brothers' running gags, the same as in the first movie. These are 1. Gays. Gay guys are all nymphomaniacs, so watch out straight guys! Don't befriend a gay guy, he's sure to fall in love with you and\/or molest you. And the doll rape scene? Not funny, just gross. 2. Handicapped people. In the first movie there was Dewey, the mentally retarded guy, whose only redeeming moment was when he turned out to be the killer who had only been faking retarded the whole time. In this movie there's Dwight, a wheelchair-bound guy who's obsessed with never asking for help. I don't think I get the joke there. We're also introduced to Hanson (played disgustingly by Chris Elliott), who has a withered hand and - well, that's it. He's gross! I mean, a withered hand, no need for a personality or anything. Just like Goldmember on Austin Powers, he's just gross for the sake of gross, and therefore not funny.3. Bodily fluids. We got to see them all in this one, and when there's a pee scene, a fart scene and a vomit scene within the first minutes, you're in trouble. The sperm explosion joke from the first movie was repeated. These are surely funny moments to some viewers, but to others like me it's just cringeworthy and disturbing.4. Sex. This can't be avoided in a teen comedy, but it was supposed to be a parody of scary movies and not all about sex. I agree with the poster who said the Wayans brothers should just make a porn movie. They seem obsessed with sex.5. Drugs. Shorty's back and still not doing anything but smoking pot. It gets really tired after a while. I did laugh when the plant rolls a joint with him inside, but other than that, it wasn't funny at all.The only part that works is the Exorcist spoof in the beginning, but even that is ruined with crap, pee and vomit jokes. Notably, this part is the only one without the main characters present. As for the roles, Anna Faris does her best, but her role is pretty much being a stupid pretty girl.

With so many talent involved, how could this movie turn out to be so disappointing? It probably is due to the messy script that uses too many plot lines that never get fully developed or that work out completely the way as they were suppose to. You can say that the movie feels incomplete. I don't know, were they in a hurry or something to complete this movie? I have a feeling that a month or two more work on the movie- and perhaps its script, would had made this movie a better one.It's still somewhat decent entertainment for the kids. The characters should be enjoyable for them and some of the comical situations are good enough to make them laugh.Robin Williams is always fun to watch in a comedy but however in this case it feels like he's holding back to not completely play a nutty professor. It's perhaps a bit of a disappointing to most. When you know Robin Williams plays the lead role in a comedy you would expect some more fireworks and hilarious situations from him. His talent is wasted, a real missed opportunity for the movie to become a great one. Christopher McDonald plays a typical 'villainoush' Christopher McDonald role and he does it once more really great. Other well known actors in the movie are Marcia Gay Harden, Raymond J. Barry (boy, he's beginning to look really old now), Ted Levine and Clancy Brown. But none of the characters feel really developed well enough in the movie, with the exception of the robotic character Weebo. Of course it's not a very good sign when the best developed- and featured character of the movie is not even an human...Also the use of 'Flubber' is highly below par. From a movie named Flubber I expected something more from the green slimy stuff. It however doesn't play a that significant role in the movie and the things that are done with the Flubber are far from original or interesting. The Flubber itself however looks fantastic through some early computer effects. Remember that this movie was released in 1997 when the special effects were of course not as advanced as present day is the case. The effects from this movie look great and really fully convincing. Too bad that it isn't featured very well in the movie.The story is of course predictable from A to Z and the movie has absolutely no surprises in it. It makes Flubber a very easily forgettable movie that is far from great. The movie had far more potential really. If only that had made some better choices with its story and perhaps picked a different director...The movie is good and professional looking, so from a technical point of view the movie does really not disappoint. Also the fun musical score by Danny Elfman makes the movie a watchable oneThe kids will probably still enjoy it but still the movie feels like a big waste of some far more and greater potential, which the movie really had.5\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"29 April 2006","score":"","review":" This movie really feels like a wasted opportunity.

But none of the characters feel really developed well enough in the movie, with the exception of the robotic character Weebo. Of course it's not a very good sign when the best developed- and featured character of the movie is not even an human...Also the use of 'Flubber' is highly below par. From a movie named Flubber I expected something more from the green slimy stuff. It however doesn't play a that significant role in the movie and the things that are done with the Flubber are far from original or interesting. The Flubber itself however looks fantastic through some early computer effects. Remember that this movie was released in 1997 when the special effects were of course not as advanced as present day is the case. The effects from this movie look great and really fully convincing. Too bad that it isn't featured very well in the movie.The story is of course predictable from A to Z and the movie has absolutely no surprises in it. It makes Flubber a very easily forgettable movie that is far from great. The movie had far more potential really. If only that had made some better choices with its story and perhaps picked a different director...The movie is good and professional looking, so from a technical point of view the movie does really not disappoint. Also the fun musical score by Danny Elfman makes the movie a watchable oneThe kids will probably still enjoy it but still the movie feels like a big waste of some far more and greater potential, which the movie really had.5\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":"Comedy, Family, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"29 April 2006","score":"18 out of 35 people found the following review useful","review":" I know a lot of people liked this movie, but I didn't.

Its very stupid but oh so funny. I laugh a lot when I watch this movie because the lines are hysterical. Farley and Perry steal the show in this uproarious movie but all the actors have funny lines to dish out. Like these for example. Higgins THERE'S AN ANIMAL NOW! everyone except Edwards and Hunt starts firing at the animal Higgins We can't kill it! We're all dead! God save us! Hunt Hold your fire! Hold your fire! everyone stops firing. Hunt looks closely and sees that the animal is just a squirrel nibbling on a acorn. Hunt It's only a squirrel. Pratt He's got something in his hand! Guy Fontenot Something in his hand! then they continue firing at the squirrel Bidwell returns to camp after a bear has bit off his leg. Bidwell Sir, I've been to hell and back. Edwards Yes, I can see that... Bidwell I suspect that you'll want to lead a hunting party to slay that terrible beast. Edwards Well, yes, that thought did cross my mind briefly. But now I have a better idea. Bidwell Yes, sir? Edwards I shall fashion for you the finest wooden leg you've ever seen. Bidwell But what about the bear? Edwards Rest assured, Bidwell, in 20 years or so, the ravages of old age will deal with the bear far more cruelly than we ever could have. Bidwell Revenge is sweet, sir.So if you like movies that are stupid yet funny this is a great one to watch.

I adored it. What an amazing story! The characters were captivating and well developed. It is one of the best books I had ever read. Then, my teacher says we are going to watch the movie. She told us about how great it was and all the Academy Awards it had won, and I was excited. I didn't really expect it to be able to live up to the book, but I knew it would still be a good film. I even got on this website, and low and behold, it is the number 12 movie of ALL TIME! I was surprised and now my expectations were a little higher. Then I watched the movie. I was shocked at how horrible of an adaptation it was. Not only that, but even if you completely forgot about the book, it was not even a good film! Where was the Christ imagery? McMurphy is the embodiment (other than his love of women) of Jesus Christ in the book. He lays down his life for the good of the other men. By the time McMurphy is wheeled back into the ward after the lobotomy in the book, all the men are gone except Chief and two others. Why? Because he gave the men strength enough to realize they did not need this place! He sacrificed himself FOR A REASON! In the movie, all the men are still in the ward! What was the reason for his sacrifice then? Also, why are the men so hateful towards each other in the movie? In the book, they band together as brothers. Again, in the movie the Chief takes a back seat. He does not even come along for the boat ride. Without delving into the Chief, you miss the whole point of the book The Combine. The book was about the sacrifice of one man to rid one small part of the world of evil and totalitarianism. They don't even scratch the surface of an evil reign in the movie. In a word, this movie was abysmal. Not even Jack Nichlosan's (SP) performance can save it.
