It was at times almost too soft for scenes in the movie, and not fitting.     I also felt that they could have made the movie a little shorter by cutting out some of the scenes that were not necessary. I think the plot of the movie should stay focused instead of wondering off into something else entirely, like some scenes in the movie did.

It brings the two famous stars into the then current year of 1961.This is a movie about a woman in Reno, Nevada (where else?) who is there to get a divorce.  On a whim (she makes up her mind fast!) she drives out to the desert on the day of her divorce with a washed out aging cowboy (Clark Gable) and his buddy (Eli Wallach) as well as her friend (Thelma Ritter).  This begins a wistful adventure and sometimes sad relationship for her with the cowboy and his misfit friends (including Montgomery Clift).  They grapple with life's issues from divorce, friendship, greed and even cruelty until finally, everyone's character and philosophy of life is laid bare in a showdown over 6 wild horses.This is an underrated cinematic gem...and I can see why.  The first time I saw this movie a few years ago I thought it was beautiful and well done but sad and too depressing with a vague ending.  Recently, I couldn't pass it by because of it's place in movie history when I saw it on DVD for just $5.88!  What a shock I got watching this one on my big screen TV in the original widescreen format in glorious black and white.  It was so fantastically fascinating from beginning to end that I watched it twice in a row.  Marilyn Monroe is an amazing actress and she brings Rosalyn Tabor to life in this film.  She's riveting and not because of her fantastic looks.  What a thrill!  Clark Gable inhabits his character Gay like he's in his own skin, making him a man you can respect and sympathize with.  Montgomery Clift, Eli Wallach and Thelma Ritter are all incredible in their roles.  I don't know how I missed so much the first time I saw this move.  It has humor, pathos and drama.  The great John Houston directs it brilliantly! The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking and the editing is sheer genius.  It's an overlooked cinematic gem and I recommend it!  Watch it twice if you're don't see the joy and hope in this film the first time.  It's there!  This crew hs created a near mastepiece.  Keep following that same bright star.  I rate this a 91\/100.

But the thing is, it's inspired weirdness, and now that I think about it, a movie where the ending twist involves people being sucked into another dimension through a giant guitar tuner deserves some kind of AFI award just for being so damn creative. I think the movie's genius is that it plays on a somewhat childish fear that many people have, but hate to admit funeral homes. This movie is intended for everyone who feels an uncomfortable, ominous atmosphere in funeral homes and cemeteries, and serves as a terrifying (and hopefully fictional) expose of just what goes on back there after dark. Yes, the movie is full of incoherent nonsense involving flying metal spheres and little demonic creatures, and some of it is unintentionally hilarious (I still think the scene with the giant fly is one of the funniest things I've ever seen), but it is a Phantasm, after all it's not supposed to make sense. It's supposed to confuse you, shock you, and unnerve you, and it sure delivers. The fact that I just can't forget this movie, even after hating it the first time I saw it, is proof of how unique it is.

But when I keep on mentioning For a Few Dollars More (English title), people to not follow me in the same way. These two Leone-movies have many differences, but they still have something in common. Booth has the excitement and the hard core mood that I seldom find in other movies.The story The film might seem thin &#150; but keeps into it's own core. Instead of focus on too much story, Leone's direction, the set design, the costumes, the presence of the actors and Morricone's music gets in focus and creates an unforgettable masterpiece and one of the most entertaining movies ever. A Western like this doesn't need more story than it has.The storytelling The film starts with the presentation of colonel Douglas Mortimer, reading in the bible on a train which he stops by his own hand ... the next scene contains 'The Return' of the man with no name ... wee see Clint Eastwood walking through the rain at the side of his horse, lighting a cigar before he enters a smoke-filled saloon. These first eminent scenes contains superb duels, and in spite of the fact that they are long, they have the highest suspense and tempo with booth silence and Morricone's pumping music combined with typical Leone-exaggerated sound effects which steals your whole attention. The presentation of the three main characters takes almost 30 minutes. Slow and boring? I found these 30 minutes to be the best part of this film and this excellent start of the movie makes it a classic in the Western AND in the Action genre! After this amazing start, the tempo becomes a bit slower but the rest of the movie is still a masterpiece...The heroes The man with no name (Clint Eastwood) is harder than ever &#150; Clint is at his best from start to end. Than we have Lee van Cleef, in his best performance, as Douglas Mortimer. He is VERY cool and mean here. Forget about the sequel The Good, The Bad and the Ugly (English title). This is his best role. Lee is superb as the former colonel, a relaxed and smart hero in black clothes, wearing lots of weapons ...The villains A filthy, evil, rotten, bloodthirsty Gian Maria Volenté is El Indio (not as handsome as in A fistful of Dollars (English title) but just as powerful and even more menacing) and he has a bunch of bandits where Klaus Kinski, Mario Brega and Luigi Pistilli makes great performances as really tough and bad guys. Just watching Luigi Pistilli in his best shape and a truly spectacular Klaus Kinski can make anyone satisfied.The direction When it comes to Leone himself this is one of his most personal and stylish directions. No other movie has succeeded to imitate this perfect film. It is not just an Italian Western. This is a fast-paced action-movie. It is loud, fast and mean. Sergio Leone's camera ... with his close ups, the perfect editing, the never-ending pans ... the loud noise from the pistols and the riffles ... and the screams of dying desperadoes.The music Ennio Morricone has made many good soundtracks, but I think that this is his best together with the one in Once Upon a Time in the West (English title). They are two different kinds of Morricone-soundtracks; this is the tough one, the other more operatic and in classic style.The trilogy The other Dollar-movies misses the pace and speed of this one.

Sergio Leone's camera ... with his close ups, the perfect editing, the never-ending pans ... the loud noise from the pistols and the riffles ... and the screams of dying desperadoes.The music Ennio Morricone has made many good soundtracks, but I think that this is his best together with the one in Once Upon a Time in the West (English title). They are two different kinds of Morricone-soundtracks; this is the tough one, the other more operatic and in classic style.The trilogy The other Dollar-movies misses the pace and speed of this one. This Dollar-movie has the toughest action scenes. From the start to end, the guns keep on shooting...Rating 10 of 10.

It incorporates just as much sleaze n cheese as Friday the 13th, yet it utilizes it better. Its slick just like any Friday the 13th, yet unlike Friday the 13th films it has impressive production values and the acting is appropriate to the material. The Teen Horror genre is supposed to jump start careers much in the same sense as teen comedies. I don't think I have to mention names, or.., this is where John Cusack, Kevin Bacon, Demi Moore, Jim Carrey,  Crispin Glover, Michael J. Fox, Sean Penn and Jamie Lee Curtis just to name a few (or a few dozen) have gotten their start in the teen comedy\/horror genre, many having entries in both. The premise comprises the surviving Elm Street children, whose parents were the criminals who track down a child murderer (Freddy Krueger) and burned him alive. (Think about the neighborhood you live in, ask yourself Does this sound like the neighbors on my block?) I love looking at the demographics of suburbia, which is why I love these movies. One of the things that add character right off the back to this film is the title to this movie, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3 DREAM WARRIORS. In a day and age where everything is MIB II, M-I 2, X2 and everything to that sort it is nice to see a title like this. Now days Hollywood thinks the audience is too stupid to remember anything considered to be more than a syllable, so they dumb it down. Even films like Spider-Man drop `The Amazing' part and same with `The Incredible' for `Hulk' to shorten what the audience has to remember. Now this title is no Dr. Strangelove and How I Learn to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, but it has the same idea. The first scene is great in this film. When Kristin (Patricia Arquette) sees those same kids jump roping and approaches the young little blonde girl, just the way the girl acts simply scares my lunch out of me. The reason, I do not know, we could get psychological, because the little blonde girl represents innocence much in the same style the girl in Poltergeist did, then turns evil resembling Linda Blair in Exorcist, combining elements of two terrifying movies.  However those movies didn't cross my mind till now. The way time has warped the film has made the FX look as cheesy as the acting in a Friday the 13th film, however for its day it was top of the line. Whenever I first watch a film, the first thing I consider is the year\/era it was made. This was during the time movie companies were shoving horror movies out to the local drive inns to make a quick buck. However this movie was released by an independent film company (Media at the time, now a larger company, New Line) and actually had effort and money put into it with the FX and the cast (I will explain later). Overall the FX made for some killer nightmares, especially when one of the kids is seduced by a naked nurse, then strapped to a bed with human tongues and suspended above a fiery pit. Getting back to the title, with all the different characters and stars (Patricia Arquette Bringing Out the Dead, Stigmata and Ed Wood,  the star of the original Heather Langenkamp, The Outsiders, Nickel Mountain and Wes Craven's New Nightmare, Lawrence Fishburne The Matrix, Hoodlum, Matrix 2 & 3 and Higher Learning, Robert Englund NOES Series, Tobe Hooper's Night Terrors, The Mangler and Wish You Were Dead and John Saxon Enter The Dragon, Black Christmas and Joe Kidd ) Dream Warriors is almost the perfect title for the movie. I say `almost' because there is one better that comes from the dialogue in this film. Freddy Krueger, we learn, was conceived after his mother was held captive in a mad house; he is therefore, the bastard son of a hundred maniacs. Nightmare on Elm Street 3 The Bastard Son of a Hundred Maniacs. Now that would make a great title for a movie. Getting back to the cast, I thought the film was cast perfect. What the problem was involved the character development. Though it passed by most 80's movie tests and put in likeable characters, it never did anything with them. Unlike its predecessor, Nightmare on Elm Street, none of the characters were like Nancy, where she was struggling with whether or not she was crazy. In the original Nancy tussles over are the nightmares illusions or real? While dealing with the aftermath of her parents divorce and the notion her mother has a drinking problem. I have often thought that resembled Sigourney Weaver's performance in Alien, adding life to a film with some not so familiar creatures. However, I must say this film fits its purpose perfectly, which I stated at the beginning is high-rent answer to the Friday the 13th saga. This is, after all a great thriller, though not as classy or scary as the original or Wes Craven's New Nightmare, making it the 3rd best in the series.There will be one thing that will always stay with me from this film, the tag line. It is an Edgar Allan Poe quote, reading`Sleep. Those little slices of death. How I loathe them.'

Lets not attribute it to just one thing, its the artsy\/indie movie industry thats evolving and everyone needs to be credited.I think this movie is on the brink of being something great but cannot get there because the editing is horrible. I think everyone agrees there were some really standout scenes with superb, oscar winning acting, but that they were mixed in with a bunch of garbage as well.  What they should have done is get the entire film back on the cutting room floor and re-edit the film so that the films 4-6 great scenes become the *central focus* of the film, instead of being 4-6 great scenes randomly thrown in with alot of so-so scenes.*spoilers* The intro scene with Jessie calling up her uncle was the key to this movie, and the spirit of the movie in my opinion. Imagine if the beginning was the dominatrix scene with Stormy (Jennifer Tilly) and Jessie pleading with her to stay at her apartment, and then set the rest of the movie as a flashback (starting with Jessie calling her uncle). This movie has LOADS of potential but it just missed the bar because of the editing in my opinion. How tragic. Jennifer Tilly stole the show in the movies best scene, where Stormy is in the doctors office waiting to get an abortion and winds up in an argument about lighting up a cigarette next to a pregnant lady. My god, after the realism in that scene sunk in, I cried really hard just because I know that is exactly what goes on in the minds of millions of women and Jennifer Tilly captured that essence *perfectly*. I would get the DVD just to watch that scene over and over. It is tragic, beautiful for its humanity, and sadly a reality for many. True, there is alot of garbage in between scenes, and many things are just not done quite so succintly, such as the scene where the strip club owner plays back a message on his answering machine of a girl who just crys and crys. We get the point that there is someone in utter sadness on the other side after the first 30 seconds or so and we dont need the fact to be beat into our head (insults the audience intelligence) Brevity, preciseness, and more demanding editing are all this film needed to take it over the top.

I think everyone agrees there were some really standout scenes with superb, oscar winning acting, but that they were mixed in with a bunch of garbage as well.  What they should have done is get the entire film back on the cutting room floor and re-edit the film so that the films 4-6 great scenes become the *central focus* of the film, instead of being 4-6 great scenes randomly thrown in with alot of so-so scenes.*spoilers* The intro scene with Jessie calling up her uncle was the key to this movie, and the spirit of the movie in my opinion. Imagine if the beginning was the dominatrix scene with Stormy (Jennifer Tilly) and Jessie pleading with her to stay at her apartment, and then set the rest of the movie as a flashback (starting with Jessie calling her uncle). This movie has LOADS of potential but it just missed the bar because of the editing in my opinion. How tragic. Jennifer Tilly stole the show in the movies best scene, where Stormy is in the doctors office waiting to get an abortion and winds up in an argument about lighting up a cigarette next to a pregnant lady. My god, after the realism in that scene sunk in, I cried really hard just because I know that is exactly what goes on in the minds of millions of women and Jennifer Tilly captured that essence *perfectly*. I would get the DVD just to watch that scene over and over. It is tragic, beautiful for its humanity, and sadly a reality for many. True, there is alot of garbage in between scenes, and many things are just not done quite so succintly, such as the scene where the strip club owner plays back a message on his answering machine of a girl who just crys and crys. We get the point that there is someone in utter sadness on the other side after the first 30 seconds or so and we dont need the fact to be beat into our head (insults the audience intelligence) Brevity, preciseness, and more demanding editing are all this film needed to take it over the top. Still, I  cant wait to get this film on DVD.  ","genre":"Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"21 June 2003","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  I love this movie!

Cameron Crowe did an excellent job writing this piece, and the soundtrack was also excellent.  Nancy Wilson is still brilliant on the guitar, and other songs by the likes of Peter Gabriel, Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney and Michael Stipe created a very relaxing and dreamlike atmosphere for this movie, which is very appropriate for reasons I will not get into for fear of ruining anything.I personally thought the ending was quite the mind-bender!  It was not quite Hitchcock, but close, and I personally left the movie in awe.  Again, without ruining anything, I will say that once the audience realizes what is going on, this movie opens up a very intriguing philosophical discussion about life and death.However, I must agree on one thing, and that is that Jason Lee did a great job in this movie.  I have long been a fan of Lee, particularly in the Kevin Smith movies and another Cameron Crowe masterpiece, Almost Famous.  It is nice to see him play a more serious role than Brodie and Bankie (see Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back).  His character is a great friend to Tom Cruise's character, and Lee did a great job of making this character believable and likeable.Perhaps this review isn't too helpful, but I don't want to give away too much, and I don't know how to describe the true genius of this movie without giving away important plot points.  All I can say is give it a chance, and I don't think you will be disappointed.

It's stylish, it's fast(despite it's running time), the high contrast black and white photography is both haunting and brutal, the acting is sometimes breathtakingly good and the use of a diverse score is inspired.Jake La Motta, the boxing 'bull' of the title, comes vividly to life on the screen in the person of De Niro. He's not a sympathetic character and neither the director nor De Niro pull any punches in telling us as much. This is a hard bitten, gritty movie with so much going for it and so much that works with no apparent effort.If there are flaws,they are few, maybe the sometimes over contrast-laden photography (which evokes the French new-wave style of the 60s)? That does get a little hard to watch on ocassion. Maybe the over-brutal and in fact over-exciting boxing scenes. We all know that middleweights do not throw so many rapid-fire punches round after round after round - they tend to hang to each other rather a lot after a few rounds and duck a lot of what's thrown at them. Here, La Motta, Suger Ray and the like all punch like rivetting guns and never miss, never duck and seldom take a breather. It's fantasy boxing, however well shot and however impressive it looks. It's like auto racing footage that used to be shown speeded up in Hollywood movies of yore. It always looks fake. Other than that, and the fact this is a grim tale with few redeeming moments of levity, it's a masterpiece in movie making. De Niro was surely seldom better and Pesci is like a firework display in full cry. Two scenes stand out above all others. One is the wonderful title sequence of the hooded La Motta warming up in the ring, in slow motion to a most beautiful piece of music (I can never remember it's title but it's heartbreakingly good!) with the background shrouded in smoke and floodlighting.Poetry. The other is a long single shot taking La Motta from the dressing room out through the corridors, into the auditorium and up into the ring with the quiet and reflection of back-stage suddenly errupting into a mad frenzy of cheering and popping flash guns. Terrific.All in all it's a hard film to actually enjoy but it's one that deserves all of it's endless admiration.
