When I was a little kid I watched for the cartoons and the funny jokes. Now I can realize just how great this film is. First off I love classic cartoons. I mean who doesn't. They are entertaining to kids, and adults can't deny that they love them too. Now imagine every and I mean every cartoon character you can think of from the golden age of animation in one film. Don't think it's possible? Think again. This film has everyone, and they even have WB and Disney characters in the same scenes together. It feels like a segregation of cartoon characters stopped and now we see everybody together. There is a hilarious scene with Daffy and Donald, and the two big guys from Disney and WB are in a scene together. It is simply amazing and it is a great feeling that will never truly be recaptured. As for the plot it is much more than just a near 2 hour cartoon short. It is a mystery, a thriller, a romance, as well as a great comedy. You really do get attached to the characters, and you get wrapped up in the mystery. It is a very well written story. Then there is the groundbreaking effects. When I was small I never thought about all the stuff the filmmakers had to do to do some of the stuff that happens in this movie. There is an ocean's worth of creativity involved. If you haven't seen these kinds of things done before you will have your jaw drop. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a work of genius.

They did jump into the whole zombie scenes pretty quick, which was good since the story was going no where in the beginning. The cast was OK. Timothy Balme was decent but the girl played by Diana Penalver was on the verge of annoying to watch. The side cast had some fun gems to watch like Elizabeth the mom and the priest who was Stuart Devenie. This film really does go in a book of fun zombie films to watch.

Mostly you see normal zombies in films which show a person with an eye out or a missing jaw. This film just goes overboard when it comes to characters. For example. One guy gets grabbed by his head and has his head and spine ripped out the backside of his body. Later you get to see this crazy character walking around.

I was still a pro wrestling fan back then, so seeing Big John Studd would have been a treat. Except for being overweight, he looked better and younger here, well after his wrestling career was over. I had to wonder though what happened to his cauliflowered forehead from all those blading jobs he did back then. So now you fast forward to the late 2000's and Mickey Rourke actually becomes The Wrestler and it's like coming full circle.I was reading the other reviews on this site, and was intrigued by the number of comparisons given Rourke and Don Johnson to Redford and Newman. I had the same thought while watching the film, but not because this was such a great buddy film. The story actually ripped off two Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid gimmicks - the 'Who are you guys?' line, and the buddy jump off the cliff to escape the posse. As far as their buddy chemistry went, I'm not convinced they were as tight as Butch and Sundance, and certainly not in the same league.As for action and plot, this one's been done dozens of times, and at best is passable for a couple of hours of light entertainment. I was probably most intrigued by the movie references made by all the memorabilia in the Old Man's bar, especially the poster and statue honoring John Wayne's Hondo. It seems I just saw a film with another Hondo poster in it not too long ago - The Man With Bogart's Face. One of the benefits of being an attentive movie fan.Anyway, I was never a big Don Johnson fan, and as for Rourke, it looked like he was doing Bruce Willis here just a couple of years after Willis got his big movie break with Die Hard.

So in essence this fantasy notion of time travel gives the writers here (in a very unlikely for a Hollywood teen flick profound way) a very inconspicuous way to explore, or to tease rather, the very real forces of taboo, oedipal complexes (though I dislike the term) , our feelings of attachment, lust, love and we also have no worse than too teenagers we can project them on. While that doesn't go anywhere really, nor should it (or could it) necessarily, it keeps a very sensual and exciting aura that spills over the dumb and formulaic scenes that make up the rest of the plot.MJ Foxes to me is a loss to the film, his constant spastic antics might add something to the comedy, but they detract a lot from his scenes with the girl.

If you're looking for a great story or masterful performances then it would be best to stick with FRANKENSTEIN or BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN but if you're looking for B movie entertainment then this here offers up some. The story is pretty basic as the mad scientist (Boris Karloff) and his hunchback assistant (J. Carrol Naish) hire Dracula (John Carradine) to knock off some people but things don't go as planned. In the second half of the film the doctor and hunchback come across Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney, Jr.) and the Frankenstein monster (Glenn Strange) and plan on an operation to cure both. HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN is without question a few steps down from the previous films in the series as you can tell things are rushed and there's really no desire to write deep characters or anything else. You could spend days talking about some of the bad stuff here but in the ends it's still just 69-minutes worth of mindless fun. There's no question that the film plays out like three different short films just thrown together and there's no question that Dracula really doesn't get used very well.

The makers can't get away with it by alleging how their movie is a parody of the 1950's sci-fi movies or a spoof of the sci-fi novels. That poorness managed to deform any dazzling image, lessen the respect for the heroic core of it, making the mix desperately cheesy and unsatisfying (The being-a-flop alert !). So, for me this is unattractive cheese. And maybe the fans of the cheesy comic books themselves waited for more.

Which leads us to different in a bad sense !Originally it wants to be comic book that tries to resemble cheap comic books yet cinematically. But maybe just resembling such a work isn't great thing to do, since it would appeal just for the die-hard, really crazy, fans of it. Further, the lack of money seduced the movie-makers to approach it as a spoof. However what's intentionally bad came off as eventually bad. So, it almost ends up as 2 movies  a sci-fi comic adventure, and the ugly parody of it; in a way that embarrassingly doesn't work.The horrible masks. The terrible special effects. And the glasses that must be wore to watch outer space's messages. They're all bad elements come from destitute production. The makers can't get away with it by alleging how their movie is a parody of the 1950's sci-fi movies or a spoof of the sci-fi novels. That poorness managed to deform any dazzling image, lessen the respect for the heroic core of it, making the mix desperately cheesy and unsatisfying (The being-a-flop alert !). So, for me this is unattractive cheese. And maybe the fans of the cheesy comic books themselves waited for more. And the other fans, who agreed with it anyway, were obviously less than making it a hit, only an exclusive classic over the years.(Peter Weller) looks agreeable, but mostly he just doesn't even try, to the extent of seeming soulless. Some reviewer said that Weller performed from the Zen zone, to be mistaken as stiff ! OK. That's fraud ! And although No matter where you go, there you are is from Confucius, but I still don't get its relation with the lead or the movie ! Singing The Skyliners' 1958 hit Since I Don't Have You is an exceptional moment. You can't find a moment as romantic as this in any sci-fi movie today. With that, singularity is something the movie, so worthwhile, wins.So, what's with the watermelon? is a smart idea as a spoof, not in a spoofing-structured movie though. It could have been so smart spoof as a whole, to be for sci-fi what Matt Helm was for James Bond. But the poor budget transformed it from a sci-fi mixed with comedy to more like a spoof of itself. Simply there is a difference between laughing at a genre and laughing at the viewers; while you sell them a poor movie as a mocking at the poor movies ! It is half wild, half bad. Whether as a sincere to the cheesy comics or a mocker at it; both ways I don't buy it. I can't imagine loving bad work, or loving bad work as homage to another bad work! And yet, the good points here force me to wait (Buckaroo Banzai vs. The World Crime League). I want the Hong Kong cavaliers to ride again, with bigger budget, and not the watermelon's secret; only more funny enigmas like it. Perhaps it'll be different AND wholly interesting this time.

It works pretty well as a travelogue of both the Australian countryside and Elle Macpherson's breasts, but it depends too much on the audience coming into the film with a certain predisposition.Anthony Campion (Hugh Grant) is an English clergyman in the 1930s who's been sent to Australia to deal with a controversial artist. The paintings of Norman Lindsay (Sam Neill) splash nudity and blasphemy across the canvas and Campion is sent to ask him to provide some less provocative work for an exhibition. Campion and his wife Estella (Tara Fitzgerald) travel to Lindsay's home and spend several days there, Campion arguing with Lindsay and Estella getting caught up with the sexually precocious models that live with Lindsay. Essentially, the movie is about Estella overcoming her button down and conventional morality through the Sapphic-tinged attentions of a model named Sheela (Elle Macpherson) and the lovelorn neediness of another model named Giddy (Portia De Rossi). A handyman named Devlin (Mark Gerber), who seems to be straight out of a Harlequin romance novel, also figures into the mix.This definitely isn't a movie you'll enjoy because of its story. It establishes Campion and Lindsay quite well as a devout but cultured man of God and an intellectual version of Hugh Hefner, respectively. Those two characters don't do very much, though. The other characters are either broadly or obviously drawn and are more like props than people. Even Estella, who's clearly becomes the main character in the movie, isn't defined as much more than a typical, middle class Englishwoman of the early 20th century, with all the generic sort of reserve and pluck than implies.Sirens is supposed to be about the sensual awakening of Estella. The problem is it never bothers to explain why she needs to be awoken. Outside of a bout of passionless sex with their pajamas on that happens late in the story, the movie doesn't explore or explain or display what's wrong with the way Campion and Estella are. Indeed, Campion is put forth as a well-adjusted Christian man while the audience is left to merely assume that Estella is repressed and unhappy. By not establishing that something is disordered or unhealthy with Estella, the film takes away any sense of purpose or significance to her journey to sexual fulfillment. It's like the audience is supposed to naturally understand there's something terribly leaden and cold about being a middle class Englishwoman in the early 20th century.I'm not sure Sirens would be much of a film if it weren't for the plentiful nudity on display but there is a lot of it, it's high quality and there's something for both genders and most orientations. The nakedness is of a more artistic than erotic quality, however. It's also interesting to see a young Hugh Grant play the exact same sort of character he's played his entire career, but with an air of more confidence and maturity. It makes you realize that the stock Hugh Grant character has somewhat aged in reverse, becoming more insecure and befuddled as Grant himself got older.The other actors all do a fine job and it's surprising that Elle Macpherson didn't get more roles after this film. In addition to being stunning, she has a real on screen presence and charisma. You always notice her when she's in a scene, and not just because she's beautiful and without clothes.Sirens has a sense of style and is not at all heavy-handed with its theme of sexual liberation. It's more diverting than engrossing, but if you like period pieces about unusual people and their odd lives (with oodles of bare flesh thrown in), you should give this film a try.

The film is not about physics, but about the tragic love story between Feynman (played by Matthew Broderick) and his wife Arline (played by Patricia Arquette). This film, because of its subject matter, was always going to be for a niche audience, but was well worth making. The screenplay was written by Patricia Broderick, Matthew's mother, and they jointly produced the film. It is a pity that Broderick has not had further directorial opportunities in the years since this one, as he has a talent for it. But that is how ruthless the film business can be, as this was clearly no money-maker, because it is too quiet and sensitive and has no super-star to give it the public acceptance. It is a sleeper that did not awaken. Films where one of the leading characters is ill all the time (Feynman's wife), and especially one who has tuberculosis, are not generally successful at the box office. The last time TB made any money was with Greta Garbo as Camille. So by deciding to do this worthy project, the Brodericks were closing the door behind them. Investors hate TB and soft, gentle films in equal measure. (They prefer explosions and healthy killers.) I recently saw Matthew Broderick on the TV series WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? where he traced his ancestors. His grandfather served in the First World War and his great-great-grandfather served in the American Civil War. (The programme resulted in his grave, which had been anonymous till then, having his name put on it. Previously he had been the unknown man killed in action outside Atlanta in Georgia on the Union side.) In the TV programme, it was obvious that Broderick is truly Mr. Nice Guy, all modesty and smiles, and that the 'boyish charm' for which he is renowned is perfectly genuine. Even though it was not his first film, FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (1986, see my review) burst like a comic miracle upon the scene at the time and launched Broderick, through the genius of John Hughes. Broderick is if anything even more delightful and amusing today. But he can be perfectly serious when required, as with this film. There is no use people complaining that Broderick is not as dynamic and mesmerising a presence as Feynman in his maturity in this film, Feynman is never older than 27, so cool it. For much of the film, Feynman is working at Los Alamos developing the atomic bomb. Names like Wigner, Oppenheimer, and Fermi are mentioned, but we don't see them.

Some of the script must have been cut, but it would have been better to leave those things in. There are many intriguing aspects to the story which are suggested in passing. For instance, Feynman raises the issue of the enrichment of Uranium. Someone ought to make a film about how the Uranium 235 was brought from Germany in a submarine (U-234, coincidentally) at the end of the War and used for the bombs over Japan because America did not have enough ready.

It's the last Disney movie until the latter half of the eighties that I would qualify as the least bit good, yet, it also suffers from many of the problems of the seventies films. This may also be the first case of mass celebrity voice casting, which works fine here but would set a horrible precedent for American animation that lasts to this day. Thankfully, while it's not quite the sum of those parts, many of its parts are highly entertaining...masterful even.As Disney himself was now fully committed to other projects, and died before the film could be completed, this is easily the most episodic and scattershot of the Disney projects under his rule. It takes Rudyard Kipling's Mowgli stories, strips them of its issues on human nature, ignores all the later stuff, and instead uses them as a vague suggestion to set up a bunch of characters and fun situations. It particularly hurts the character of Bagheera, whose commitment to getting the child home doesn't make quite as much sense, and Shere Khan's delayed entrance, though well foreshadowed, doesn't have quite the weight or the mythic sort of relationship with Mowgli. Mowgli himself is the cute little scamp Disney requires by this point, which has its value but isn't' as interesting as if they'd made better use of his whole raised by wolves thing like in the book. Not Disney's forte, perhaps, but one reason why this isn't as good as Princess Mononoke to me (strange comparison, I know).Animation wise, thoughts are liable to be mixed on this one. There's more shortcuts here than in any previous Disney movie. Reused animation aplenty, funky relationships with the cels and the backgrounds, lots of the kind of stuff director Wolfgang Reitherman would abuse in the seventies. There's one bit in particular that's a straight lift from Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.What at least mostly makes up for this, however, is the fact that this is a tour-de-force of master animators doing some of the best work of their career. Ollie Johnston and Milt Kahl do a great bit with Bagheera trying to get Mowgli into a tree that has no real plot significance but which is a masterpiece of timing. Bear Necessities is an iconic number, but would it be so memorable without Ollie Johnston's fantastic work on Baloo? Johnston also does a remarkable job with Baloo's more emotional moments, such as the scene where he tells Mowgli that he has to leave the jungle. John Lounsbery gives a wonderful feeling of weight and caricature to the elephants, arguably his masterpiece. King Louie works mostly because of his animation by Frank Thomas and Kahl, which is so intricately composed and full of personality that it looks easy (even though it's a monstrous bitch to pull off something like that, especially with his hyperactive movement). However, my favorite bit is the restrained yet perfectly controlled, Picasso-influenced work on Shere Khan by Milt Kahl. It's not the most bombastic of these pieces, but his graceful movement combined with his sinister presence (George Sanders' voice work helps quite a bit). The exchange between him and Johnston's Kaa is brilliant animated acting between two of the greatest animators who ever lived.Yet, while all these moments are wonderful to watch, there comes a point toward the end where things seem to just fall apart.

It's the last Disney movie until the latter half of the eighties that I would qualify as the least bit good, yet, it also suffers from many of the problems of the seventies films. This may also be the first case of mass celebrity voice casting, which works fine here but would set a horrible precedent for American animation that lasts to this day. Thankfully, while it's not quite the sum of those parts, many of its parts are highly entertaining...masterful even.As Disney himself was now fully committed to other projects, and died before the film could be completed, this is easily the most episodic and scattershot of the Disney projects under his rule. It takes Rudyard Kipling's Mowgli stories, strips them of its issues on human nature, ignores all the later stuff, and instead uses them as a vague suggestion to set up a bunch of characters and fun situations. It particularly hurts the character of Bagheera, whose commitment to getting the child home doesn't make quite as much sense, and Shere Khan's delayed entrance, though well foreshadowed, doesn't have quite the weight or the mythic sort of relationship with Mowgli. Mowgli himself is the cute little scamp Disney requires by this point, which has its value but isn't' as interesting as if they'd made better use of his whole raised by wolves thing like in the book. Not Disney's forte, perhaps, but one reason why this isn't as good as Princess Mononoke to me (strange comparison, I know).Animation wise, thoughts are liable to be mixed on this one. There's more shortcuts here than in any previous Disney movie. Reused animation aplenty, funky relationships with the cels and the backgrounds, lots of the kind of stuff director Wolfgang Reitherman would abuse in the seventies. There's one bit in particular that's a straight lift from Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.What at least mostly makes up for this, however, is the fact that this is a tour-de-force of master animators doing some of the best work of their career. Ollie Johnston and Milt Kahl do a great bit with Bagheera trying to get Mowgli into a tree that has no real plot significance but which is a masterpiece of timing. Bear Necessities is an iconic number, but would it be so memorable without Ollie Johnston's fantastic work on Baloo? Johnston also does a remarkable job with Baloo's more emotional moments, such as the scene where he tells Mowgli that he has to leave the jungle. John Lounsbery gives a wonderful feeling of weight and caricature to the elephants, arguably his masterpiece. King Louie works mostly because of his animation by Frank Thomas and Kahl, which is so intricately composed and full of personality that it looks easy (even though it's a monstrous bitch to pull off something like that, especially with his hyperactive movement). However, my favorite bit is the restrained yet perfectly controlled, Picasso-influenced work on Shere Khan by Milt Kahl. It's not the most bombastic of these pieces, but his graceful movement combined with his sinister presence (George Sanders' voice work helps quite a bit). The exchange between him and Johnston's Kaa is brilliant animated acting between two of the greatest animators who ever lived.Yet, while all these moments are wonderful to watch, there comes a point toward the end where things seem to just fall apart.

The two main characters do fairly good Crosby and Hope impressions with just enough of a twist to make it different.The animation is fantastic. Wonderful fluid lines and bright colors make for a wonderful landscape. Occasionally they have special effects of computer animation. These scenes don't quite work so well, but fortunately, they last mere seconds and are few and far between.It really is a great movie for the whole family. I've read other reviews that complain about nudity, foul language, and sexual scenes in this film. I want assure all parents out there are **no such scenes in this movie**. My family has watched this movie *dozens* of times with small children and nothing offended us *at all*. I can only guess that the other reviewers are vaguely remembering scenes and letting their adult imagination fill in things that never actually happened. If you stretch your imagination, you can see some puns and light double entendre for the adults, but I stress that they are *very* subtle and *way* over the heads of anybody under 12.Their are some scary parts and some tense moments that our toddler jumped at, but nothing too bad.The movie is filled with humor everywhere that will have everybody laughing. The main characters are thieves and con-artists, but they are the funny, kind hearted kind of rogues you've seen in many other movies.Overall, I very much recommend it. There are so few movies that both adults and children of all ages will likely and the Road to El Dorado is one of them.

It was amazingly hilarious and refreshing. Unlike Child's Play 3, we didn't repeat the boring process of Chucky Goes after Andy for revenge and his body. We had a fresh array of characters, a brilliant Cliffhanger and a new Killer Doll. The film really displays well how Chucky, like the rest of us, can have an relationship, and how he is still Human, despite being a Doll. Good examples of his Humanity are when he listens to music in the car, treats Tiffany like a House-Slave and has Sexual Intercourse with Tiff. These display that Chucky is a Human being, and while some fans disliked this, I say the film was pure comic genius, comedic and horrifying. Inventive new murders were used such as the Champange Bottle and Celing Mirror, the Nasils in the Car and the Bus hitting that poor fellow. The film ended amazingly as Glen appeared to burst out of Tiffany's womb, leaving a good idea for a sequel. That is until Seed came along.
