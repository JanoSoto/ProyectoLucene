Personally, I feel that fact should be painfully obvious to anyone who tries watching this piece of crap.Every time I watch a movie, I usually find myself going to the internet to try to learn a little bit more about it. One thing of interest I found was that the screenwriter supposedly tried sending this script to Stanley Kubrick in the hopes he'd be interested in making the film. Seriously?! Give me a friggin' break! Did he honestly believe Kubrick would touch this? If so, he seriously needs to check into a mental health facility.I also learned that apparently Christian Slater sent Jack Nicholson a message asking him to watch the movie and tell him what he thought...Nicholson never responded. Now, I can't say for sure what Nicholson's reasons for not responding were, but I'd assume that he either A.) Thought the movie looked ridiculously stupid and had the good sense to avoid it.or B.) Saw the movie, but was appalled that Christian Slater would so blatantly attempt to copy him that he didn't want to encourage any further contact from Slater by even responding to let him know the movie sucked.I seriously doubt Nicholson even saw the movie, but if he did, I think it's fairly safe to say he didn't like it if he wasn't willing to respond to Slater.Maybe I veered off course on my review, but I think the main point I'm trying to make is that this movie blows and everyone who thinks otherwise is obviously a little off their nut.

Additionally, the overall feel of the film is a gritty one that I am sure was used intentionally to highlight the stories bleak nature. Growing up in the generation I have, I have never been afforded the opportunity to go back and watch films like this that launched the careers of what are now established and respected actors. That being said, I also believe that many of the films of that era, ( late 60's\/ early 70's) were designed to appeal to the widespread drug culture that was taking over America. The trippy dutch angle camera work as well as the montage at the party scene of reds, and blues, and cutting back and forth only further serves to reinforce this idea. The acting in the film is great and it is clear to see why both Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight were nominated for and won so many awards for their performances. But if I can be honest, I did not get the point. I understand the intended meaning of the film, namely the disconnect between the rich and poor during that era. However, all the film really made me was confused and a bit sad. The end of the film is on such a down note that I could not help but to feel bad.

And this they did... and Urban legends for the most part is a great film, full of suspense and clever twists and manages to keep you guessing and as paranoid as the characters in the film. But it is ruined towards the end by an unlikely conclusion and a stupid ending; the end products of a Titanic that just steamed ahead and sunk before it reached it's destination.Like many cynics, I approached this film not expecting a whole lot. Despite being a huge fan of the horror genre, and in particular, slashers, too often a time have I been disappointed, and found myself violated even, by an absolutely atrocious and dumb slasher film - and there are many! The list would exceed the length of my arm. But Urban legend was an exception... the majority of it, anyway. With a superb opening, involving - SOMEONE'S IN THE BACK SEAT - that sent such chills down my spine, this looked on it's way to be a great one. But could it hold up? For an hour at least... and then it began to get predictable I thought... but was it? After messing around with our heads for awhile, Silvio Horta then delivered his final twist - which essentially ruined the whole picture! I don't' know, maybe it was just me, but I just found the identity of the killer to be a complete let down and an insult to the audience. It was pathetic really, and the ending was just oh so typical.

Tara Reid from American Pie also stars, alongside Alicia Witt and best of all - Robert Englund - Freddy Krueger! - in a brilliant performance as Prof. Wexler. Also starring is the very familiar Julian Richings, a creepy, charismatic guy who you'll recognise no problem if you see him in anything else. He plays the 'weird janitor', and when asked how long he's been working on the campus, his abrupt reply is Too damn long!. Maybe it was because they were the first words he spoke in the film, but that had me in stitches. That, and the deans remarks about the whereabouts of a missing student - He is probably shacked up in some motel somewhere with a girl - or a boy... or a farm animal! Weren't you ever eighteen? A decent film for the most part, but I just found the last fifteen minutes to be god-awful, and enough for me to drop it down to a rating of 4.

It is dull.This does show what the blue bloods of that era actually thought was the future and what they thought was progressive, but rest assured, the 90% who you didn't hear from thought it was backwards. And we've seen a progression since then, which does make this a dated piece.

As Ben, he is able to bring a sense of vulnerability to the character that might have otherwise been lost by a different actor. That being said, the entire cast is pretty great, with a solid job done all around. Technically the film is great as well. There are a lot of really interesting camera tricks done to make the film the masterpiece it is. For example, the framing scene in the beginning of the movie, where Ben is only visible through the triangle formed by Mrs. Robinsons leg is a particularly well-done. Another example would include the graphic match cut when Ben is in the pool and then in bed with Mrs. Robinson. This film delivers on all platforms, both technically and in form and content. The plot left a little something to be desired in my opinion, as it seems that there is no real explanation of certain events, i.e. Ben;s decision to marry Elaine. It just kind of happens out of nowhere and the audience has to go along with it. I think in a way that there is a message in there about the disconnect among older and younger generations with the inherent message being that the younger generation is going to live the way it wants and damn anyone who tried to stop them. Conversely, this also says something about the sense of rigidity with which the older generation live their own lives. This all serves to accentuate the generation gap theory that became so much a part of new Hollywood films during that period. The one part of the film that I did enjoy a lot, not to suggest that I did not enjoy the rest of it, is the end. I genuinely liked the fact that both Ben and Elaine have the epiphany or realization that life is not all happy and that rough times await. It is a nice break from the typical happy ending that most would expect. I would definitely recommend this film both because of how visually pleasing it is, but also for the powerful message it delivers.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"2 December 2011","score":"7 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" I have nothing negative to say about A Walk to Remember. Its few cons are totally overpowered by the sheer wonder and sincerity of this remarkable film, perhaps one of the best ever emanating from Hollywood and Warner Brothers &#x96; a monumental feat given its small production budget. The subtle power of this film keeps one thinking about it continuously and wanting to see it multiple times. It's a wonderful story about growing up and how one special person can change you forever. It shows how deeply loving someone can transform you to gain the strength to forgive, to accept, to respect, and to accomplish that which you heretofore would never consider. This movie conveys what true love really is, how it can affect people in life and death, and how absolutely beautiful it can be for those lucky enough to experience its deepest level.The movie is so caring and sincere, it subtly draws you into it. It shows a popular in-crowd teenage boy discovering there is much more to life than reckless, carefree, aimless behavior. When a stupid prank turns harmful, a perpetrator, Landon (one lead character played by Shane West) is sentenced to perform community service activities, and these bring him into close contact with Jamie, a non-cool, non-popular nerdy religious girl (the other lead character played by Mandy Moore), who performs the same activities -- by choice. Landon has heretofore always treated Jamie with ridicule and disdain. Though he's known her all his life, through their interaction he suddenly discovers her passion for life, with interests and a depth he never knew existed. He begins to find a new path for his own life, and the ensuing transformation is wonderfully portrayed.Although the picture's main theme is about Landon and the transformation he undergoes, Jamie is clearly the anchor of this movie. She's exceptionally sweet, genuine, innocent, highly intelligent and passionate. She was so interested in astronomy, that she built her own telescope and would venture into their small town cemetery, in the middle of the night, to pursue her celestial passion. She did this, not to impress, but for its own sake. Her beliefs in herself are solid and she never changes. She wears no makeup and wears the same low-key, non-fashionable baggy clothes from the beginning, throughout and to the end of the picture. She actually likes who she is -- the way she is. Unlike Landon, her self-image is not based on what others think.She has just enough attitude to not take any disingenuousness from anyone &#x96; and when being toyed with would often fire right back. When Dean (a friend of Landon's and leader of the in-crowd pack) mockingly asked her why her Higher Power could not get her a new sweater (she always wore the same one), she responded, He's too busy looking for your brain. When Landon humiliated her in front of his peers, she coolly walked away at the time, but when he later came to her for help she calmly slammed the door in his very surprised face. She's a strong figure that sees through the behavior and demeanor of her peers. Her role demonstrates how one individual of virtue, faith and an up-beat attitude can so positively influence those around her by simply living her life true to her own beliefs, and not succumbing to peer pressure forces, no matter how difficult.Landon's role clearly demonstrates the power of forgiveness and how its redemptive qualities can bring about caring unselfish behavior. Landon's in-crowd peers, treating Jamie cruelly at every opportunity (and eventually ostracizing him when he defended her), were eventually forgiven by Landon, and when tragedy struck they were all there to offer their support for him (and ask for forgiveness, each in their own way). And in what may be the film's most touching scene (though there are many), Landon essentially forgives his estranged father for leaving his family for another woman, and thanks him for his considerable support in making it possible for Jamie to return home.One leaves this movie with a number of messages. The movie teaches to always be open to new experiences and to never judge a book by its cover. The strongest message, however, is that of being a better more passionate person yourself, and to cherish those around you and the time you have with them. You're left with a sense of true love being so deep and pure that just being with the one you love brings such wonderful joy to your life. You would do anything for that person, even putting your own happiness aside for the sake of theirs. Jamie was able to change an arrogant, self-absorbed teenager into a tender, loving person who was willing to do virtually anything for her &#x96; and did!Don't be surprised if you end up falling in love with both Moore's and West's characters. The enduring innocence, sweetness, evolving chemistry and eventual deep love between the movie's leads is genuine, totally heartfelt and compelling &#x96; unequaled in any other movie. In the middle of this film are a series of the most incredibly romantic scenes you will ever see in an American firm. They easily flow from scene to beautiful scene, showing two intelligent, thoughtful and sincere people slowly falling for each other. From Casablanca to Love Story to Titanic, no other on-screen pair conveys such an honestly felt passion for each other.Despite the considerable sadness surrounding their romance, the movie leaves the audience with optimism for life, love, faith and the ability for everyone to change, the possibility to become a better person -- at any age. I watch it repeatedly with both joy and melancholy. Perhaps Pulitzer Prize winner Roger Ebert (renowned longtime Chicago-Sun Times film\/TV critic) said it best when he concluded in his film review, A Walk to Remember is a small treasure.

Sure, he's playing the same character here as he was in Easy Rider, but here it is so effective...it's just indescribable.Coppola entered the 70's with The Godafther, and he exited them with Apocalypse Now. That should tell you all you need to know about Mr. Coppola's skill and determination to making a great movie. The shot where Martin Sheen emerges from the water to kill Col.

Coming out on a risky summer season, where BATMAN FOREVER was the talk of the town, BABE found its audience thanks to word of mouth and some positive critic reviews. Now, it's considered one of the finest family films ever made; an witty, creative and original movie. If only its sequel BABE PIG IN THE CITY received such grace. It more than deserves it. At first, a sequel to BABE seems like trying to sequelize the original WIZARD OF OZ (And no! RETURN TO OZ does not count). Why make a sequel to a surprise hit that was unique and surprising which would only detract from what the first one achieved. But in the hands of the inventive yet sadly under-appreciated Australian filmmaker George Miller (co-writer and producer of BABE), the sequel finds an interesting direction Why not do what the original did; do something that goes against what audiences are expecting. Sadly, audience don't always warm-up to re- inventions of familiar premises. And whereas BABE was a light-hearted charmer sprinkled with moments aimed at grown-ups, PIG IN THE CITY is a little darker and more menacing, but still mixed with some of the same charm and inventiveness of the first. People sadly didn't warm-up with Miller's darker and more eccentric tone (the film is almost outright surrealism) and it remains misunderstood to this day. Luckily, home video has done the proper justice to this little gem and its finally seeing more positive light than during its original release. The storyline is incredible; combining a witty live-action cartoon, a quirky slapstick comedy, a Dickensian modern fairy tale, and some totally oddball surrealism. Immediately, the story begins with Farmer Hoggett (the brilliant James Cromwell, given very little screen time here though) getting caught in an accident that leaves his wife Esme (a hilarious Magda Szubaski) doing all the work in the farm, until a notice for foreclosure forces her to travel to the big city, in hopes of taking Babe to a special appearance and use the appearance fee as payment to their loan. But their city isn't as welcoming as expected. Almost immediately, Mrs. Hoggett finds herself accidentally convicted of drug possession and gets kicked-off almost everywhere (Scram lady! This isn't a farm!), until she finds a small hotel that actually hosts a couple of strange homeless animals. There, Babe meets a number of strange denizens including a group of showbiz chimpanzees, a disabled- to-the-waist dog named Flealick, a couple of other dogs and cats, and then some strays who finds comfort in Babe's hospitality and a ruthless pitbull who finds himself converted when an act of kindness from Babe gives him a wake-up call. Eventually, he also meets up with old pal Ferdinand, who thinks of Babe as his lucky pig, only to realize to this little porker's potential. Though the storyline is rather simple (it's really another fish-out- water tale) and its morals are traditional, the film doesn't offer easy paths. You're just a pig in the big city! says Ferdinand the duck at one point in the film. What could you possibly do? Why even try? Immediately, the merits of morality and kindness in a different world where the rules are very different from the simple life in the country are questioned. Could kindness and humility overcome differences, change lives, inspire others even in a world as hopelessly bleak as an uninviting urban environment? Add to that, the movie even makes possible references to Babe as something of a Christ-figure, who finds himself serving up kindness to a bunch of city animals who finds the very idea oblivious. I'm just a pig on a mission. Babe says at one point. Even if you don't see it at that angle, the movie is still the stuff of classic fairy tale viewed on more mature eyes. Kids will love its cute animals and fun slapstick (the climax is as crazy as it is lively and hilarious), but adults will find the story actually willing to transcend beyond the levels of what kids movies would usually go.

Danny DeVito), and the music is just great. I loved it. You will, too.It is very hard to do justice to this movie in a summary. First, Smoochy gives a dark twist to children's TV programming and especially to children's charities, portraying them more as crime syndicates than do-good organizations. In one scene, Sheldon (Ed Norton), who is Smoochy the Rhino, declines to do an ice show, thus cutting off expected revenues to a well known children's charity. He is severely warned, They are the roughest of all the charities.Ed Norton is superb. You first meet an impossibly sincere, saccharine character who sits at a bar drinking orange juice spiked with liquid alfalfa---and gets buzzed. And you believe him. But, there are a couple of moments when he reveals the potential for insensate rage, and you learn that one time in his life he had to learn anger management, thus giving an entirely different spin to the character.Norton is exquisitely supported by all the others. Catherine Keener is a revelation. Early in the movie, Nora (Keener) is a hard-bitten TV exec who puts Sheldon (Norton)in his place, I didn't discover you. I delivered you. I have a bigger emotional investment in my nail polish.Later, she reveals a vulnerable woman who was used and hurt by the cads all around her in the children's TV business. Rebuffing Rainbow Randolph's (Robin Williams) suggestion they take up where they left off, years ago, Nora ripostes,Nora I was young. And stupid. Randolph And limber.The acting quality runs deep, including the bit players. Michael Rispoli is masterful as Spinner Dunn. And for sheer visual impact, the prize goes to Vincent Schiavelli. What would a lecherous, heroine-addicted clown, hired to assassinate another clown, look like? He would look like Buggy Ding Dong. You have to see him to believe it. You will burst out laughing.That the critics hated this movie brings up what I call the Bulworth effect, which I first noticed around 1998, when that awful movie came out. So, Bulworth is to movies what shoe leather is to filet mignon. But for the young Halle Barry, Bulworth would be unwatchable. However, it is politically correct, and that is the only possible explanation for the raves it got from critics.Death To Smoochy is politically very INcorrect. And that is the only possible explanation for the hammering it got from critics. If you have ever wondered why your own impressions of a movie differ so greatly from that of the critics, politics is the likely explanation.

First, Smoochy gives a dark twist to children's TV programming and especially to children's charities, portraying them more as crime syndicates than do-good organizations. In one scene, Sheldon (Ed Norton), who is Smoochy the Rhino, declines to do an ice show, thus cutting off expected revenues to a well known children's charity. He is severely warned, They are the roughest of all the charities.Ed Norton is superb. You first meet an impossibly sincere, saccharine character who sits at a bar drinking orange juice spiked with liquid alfalfa---and gets buzzed. And you believe him. But, there are a couple of moments when he reveals the potential for insensate rage, and you learn that one time in his life he had to learn anger management, thus giving an entirely different spin to the character.Norton is exquisitely supported by all the others.

So, Bulworth is to movies what shoe leather is to filet mignon. But for the young Halle Barry, Bulworth would be unwatchable. However, it is politically correct, and that is the only possible explanation for the raves it got from critics.Death To Smoochy is politically very INcorrect.

Its sad that the world of Disney has cheapened the animation genre with over the top cheesy adaptations making monstrosities of classic tales and even factual histories into pop up musicals. Then people discovered Manga which was soon ruined by excessive nudity and cheap sex sells titles. I'm glad to say this timeless flight of dragons brings back animation and art to the level deserving of mass viewing.As with all stories, it must be believable and amazing at the same time, without being predictable. You must have guessed I'm a sceptic since decades of disappointing films, movies and cartoons. But Flight of Dragons has lasted 30 years strong, and now my children watch it and everyone I introduced this animation to has passed it on too. And no matter how many times I watch it, I am always captivated by the swooping musical score and the sincerity of the way Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin Jr want to transport you to their love of the books they have an obvious fanaticism to.
