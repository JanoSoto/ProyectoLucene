It had Chase at is best as fast-talking quick witted reporter . It was funny movie with a solid , realistic detective story which was a quite faithful adaptation of the first book in the Fletch series by Gregory McDonald. A hit book series produces an original hit movie and there is enough material to use for new movie so the decision to make sequel seems logical , right ? It can't go wrong , right ? WRONG. There were eight sequels and prequels written by Gregory McDonald that could have been used as the basis for the second Fletch movie at the time and yet Universal decided to write a completely new story. WHY ?! If something works ,don't fix it ! Thanks to this illogical decision Fletch lives sucks badly and in the end result it flopped. The Fletch series ended here, when Chase could easily have made a career starring in his own franchise for few next years. Oh , those stupid, arrogant Hollywood producers .They should have adapted another one of the books&#x85;The mystery here is lame , rather predictable and silly stuff that could easily appear in Scooby Doo cartoon. Fletch moves to South and meets hillbillies, racists, and religious zealots . The movie is really just a string of clichés with a loose plot thrown in. The story is VERY thin and the focus seems to have shifted to Fletch's disguises and gags rather than working on layers of mystery.The another big problem here is that the humor doesn't work at all. The gags come way faster and more frequently in the original. The jokes are stupid and very often of the lowest kind of vulgar humor. Fletch ends as an annoying character not charming one. I also don't know why, but somehow he is terribly egoistic here and doesn't seem to care or like anybody at all (which is completely against the character we came to like in the first movie &#x96; he had big ego, sure , be he liked and helped other people).Chevy Chase is still great with his usual cynical wit , comedic timing and the various disguises , but sadly he can't win against the poor screenplay . Same goes here for good character actors like R. Lee Ermey (Full metal jacket) and Randall Tex Cobb (Raising Arizona). The rest of the cast is just as bland and boring like the characters they play. The music by Harold Faltermeyer is still great with pretty cool new music theme that appears in the opening credits. It's probably the best thing in this movie.Avoid it at all cost , even if you liked the original. One of the crappiest sequels of all time. I give it 1\/10.

I saw this film in The theater after new year in 2001 when it was released by us in Slovenia. It was the first Schwarzenegger movie I ever saw in the theater before. Later in 2003 I went watching Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines in summer August (2003). Those two film were the only Schwarzenegger films I have actually saw! And I love both of them, I even remember how this film was a huge hit in 2001, I kept seeing a VHS cover in the video rent store, I even saw the poster that time. So the film was a hit back than in 2001 when it was released and come to us in the cinema. What can I say it is one of my favorite Schwarzenegger action flicks. This film compared to Terminator Genysys, Maggie, Sabotage and The Expendables 3 it is a much, much better improvement action futuristic flick than all the new movies I just counted Schwarzenegger did. This movie is awesome if you like near future action movies, than this is the movie for you. The 6th Day is good, I liked the action bits and the premise is actually quite interesting. It does follow the same old script tactics and the performances are... lets say uninspired. This was definitely a movie using Arnold's action star status for it's gain, pushing every little Arnold trait to the limit especially cheesy punch lines but this is a very enjoyable and cool action flick but it ain't T2. The movie works well for Arnold's action fans. A story premise that fits where technology was and is today. Cloning humans would represent a real danger but it also has moral issues to go with it. Robert Duvall's acting weight helps boost this movie along with Michael Rooker and Tony Goldwyn as the bad guys and this one is a winner. Arnold Schwarzenegger did a great job and he tried very hard acting in this one with not so much action as most Arnold films. Movie does a great job into deep details of cloning, too bad they wear having those high tech stuff. This film and has a good scenes, great action and the dialogue is funny. The scene when Arnold says when I told you to go screw yourself I didn't mean take it literally. This film is kind of science VS religion because the people who killed Tony Goldwyn's character religious people are against cloning because it is man playing God. I know the bad guys have their reasons for not wanting the business to be shut down if they are found out that they are clones, but in my opinion I think maybe they were afraid of death and want to use cloning as a way to cheat it and not die permanently, but that is just my opinion. I think the rest of the cast did a pretty good job, Michael Rapaport was awesome as Adam's friend, Sarah Wynter did a great job performance of her character Talia Elsworth as the bad guy and she acted very well. I remember Sarah Wynter from 24 (2001) TV series she play Kate Warner in Season 2. The second Season of 24 was always my favorite season of the show. She did made a brief cameo scene in Season 3 episode Day 3 100 p.m.-200 p.m.. Gosh today I don't see her in any famous roles or in movies at all. Where did this world come to? from 2000 - 2011 years for me were awesome. Today movies are really awful made. I am glad I see this movie in theaters it is my favorite film and I love it to death! Director Roger Spottiswoode (Tomorrow Never Dies, Noriega) creates a world of the very near future in which cattle, fish, and even the family pet can be cloned. But cloning humans is illegal - that is until family man Adam Gibson (Arnold Schwarzenegger) comes home from work one day to find a clone has replaced him. Taken from his family and plunged into a sinister world he doesn't understand, Gibson must not only save himself from the assassins who must destroy him to protect their secret, but uncover who and what is behind the horrible things happening to him. The 6th Day is the story of Gibson's struggle to reclaim his life and his family.Director Roger Spottiswoode directed another film that I love 007 flick Tomorrow Never Dies another underrated Bond film and action adventure Shoot to Kill (1988) with Sidney Poitier. I love this underrated action sci-fi Schwarzenegger flick a 7.5\/10 it does not deserve the hate or been bashed for it.

Every time I see it I kept getting excited to see in it again. Red Heat is a buddy routine classic underrated action flick! I grew up with this film and I still love watching it today. Classic 80's action flick with Arnold doing his bad Russian accent and Belushi's hyper kinetics' acting. None the less they have good chemistry together and there's plenty of good one liners and action sequences to make this one very entertaining. Seeing the styles and fashions of the day is pretty funny and brings back lots of good memories from that period. After The Running Man Arnold made Red Heat. At that time it was a quite good film but now the movie looks a little out dated. Between The Terminator and Raw Deal there is Schwarzenegger's Red Heat, the 1988 action peace which also co-stars Jim Belushi who provides the comic relief from the Director who gave us Eddie Murphy in 48 hrs. Red Heat is the typical 80's action cop genre picture Arnold entertained us with during the 80's. This also would mark his last 80's picture he would then be back in 1990's Total Recall and the phenomenal sequel Terminator 2 a year later. But back to this gem. Red Heat is one of Arnie's finest movies. Though not taken seriously by a lot of his fans and fans of the 80's movies. Both Belushi and Arnold deliver really fine performances that match each other well. Of course a very young Gina Gershon makes a little appearance. Still looking exactly the same as she does today. This is one of my favorite Arnold & Belushi movie. Also Gina Gershon and Laurence Fishburne are co staring in this film. Also I think Gina Gershon did terrific job in here she also co started in Steven Seagal's film Out For Justice (1991). This film is very bashed and hated, I grew up with this film. I love that Arnold plays A Russian Cop who fly's in to the States to find and track down a ruthless criminal Viktor Rostavili (Ed O'Ross) to bring him back to Russia. I still think Red Heat is one of Walter Hill's best movies, his first film was 48 Hrs. (1982) with Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy. I love James Belushi as a street wise detective Art Ridzik.

Every time I see it I kept getting excited to see in it again. Red Heat is a buddy routine classic underrated action flick! I grew up with this film and I still love watching it today. Classic 80's action flick with Arnold doing his bad Russian accent and Belushi's hyper kinetics' acting. None the less they have good chemistry together and there's plenty of good one liners and action sequences to make this one very entertaining. Seeing the styles and fashions of the day is pretty funny and brings back lots of good memories from that period. After The Running Man Arnold made Red Heat. At that time it was a quite good film but now the movie looks a little out dated. Between The Terminator and Raw Deal there is Schwarzenegger's Red Heat, the 1988 action peace which also co-stars Jim Belushi who provides the comic relief from the Director who gave us Eddie Murphy in 48 hrs. Red Heat is the typical 80's action cop genre picture Arnold entertained us with during the 80's. This also would mark his last 80's picture he would then be back in 1990's Total Recall and the phenomenal sequel Terminator 2 a year later. But back to this gem. Red Heat is one of Arnie's finest movies. Though not taken seriously by a lot of his fans and fans of the 80's movies. Both Belushi and Arnold deliver really fine performances that match each other well. Of course a very young Gina Gershon makes a little appearance. Still looking exactly the same as she does today. This is one of my favorite Arnold & Belushi movie. Also Gina Gershon and Laurence Fishburne are co staring in this film. Also I think Gina Gershon did terrific job in here she also co started in Steven Seagal's film Out For Justice (1991). This film is very bashed and hated, I grew up with this film. I love that Arnold plays A Russian Cop who fly's in to the States to find and track down a ruthless criminal Viktor Rostavili (Ed O'Ross) to bring him back to Russia. I still think Red Heat is one of Walter Hill's best movies, his first film was 48 Hrs. (1982) with Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy. I love James Belushi as a street wise detective Art Ridzik.

It really does depend on the screenplay and who stars in the film and a few other key details. Pal Joey has its ups and downs and is overall entertaining but mostly thanks to Frank Sinatra and his larger than life persona that is hard to ignore in any capacity. It has elements of romance and music and drama and a few genuinely funny moments. Ideally though this is a vehicle for Sinatra. With anyone else in his role it wouldn't have been even nearly as good. His charisma saves this from being a rather hum drum sort of romantic comedy\/musical. I think the biggest problem I personally had with the film was the lack of chemistry between the leads. I think in order for this to be genuinely great you need a guy and two girls that have great energy opposite of each other. At the heart (pun intended) of the film is a romance and yet you don't really feel that. The main character is such an egotistical ladies man and you expect a full turn around but I'm not sure you ever get that. You are sort of left with he is who he is but she's gonna be with him anyways.I have very little experience watching Frank Sinatra on screen but I love the man for his albums, always have since I was a kid, so the highlight of this movie for me was seeing him perform. He is mesmerizing and it is easily the strong point in the film. Singing Lady is A Tramp to Rita Hayworth was definitely worth the price of admission. Sinatra is very good in this role and suits it to a T. He is perfectly believable as a street-wise ladies man with big dreams and his character actually is a complex guy and I'm not sure we get everything out of one movie. Kim Novak is beautiful of course and her role as Karen English is decent. I just didn't feel like she got a lot of depth nor did her and Sinatra have the right chemistry. They had some good scenes and some okay banter but the door is open here for this terrific love-hate rivalry that never really takes off. Rita Hayworth is also very good if not just a touch obvious as the aristocratic Vera Simpson who lures Frank's Joey into a relationship of necessity. Hayworth's character is not very likable though she has a very good turning point in the end. However, like Novak, her chemistry with Sinatra is okay at best and her and Novak don't share enough screen time.Like many directors of the time, George Sidney has done other musical to screen adaptations. I just think Pal Joey isn't necessarily the right stage play to adapt though I'd love to see a modern take on it (think Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan annnnd Julia Roberts in the 90's) but the chemistry was off, the pacing doesn't feel quite right and the music is a little underwhelming. Still, it is a classic for a reason and it was fun. Some of the dialogue (especially from Sinatra) was legendary. He was a fast talking sarcastic lout and he did it well. I would think for its time, Pal Joey was a touch racy and I actually liked that about it. Watching a classic with a little bit of an adult edge for its time made me feel a little naughty like I'm sure it did for them back in 1957. I can assure you that I will now check out some of Frank Sinatra's more well known roles so the movie is not a total loss. Its worth seeing if you love the classics but certainly far from the best out there. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 November 2015","score":"","review":" I have said before that sometimes stage plays, even great ones, don't translate well to film and sometimes they do.

God taking a photograph Jim thinks he sees that four years and seemingly several lifetimes later, as a starving, exhausted prisoner witnessing the brilliant light of the atomic bomb.What transpires in between, the sweeping story of Jim's wartime exploits after he is separated from his family, is set forth so spectacularly in Steven Spielberg's ''Empire of the Sun'' that the film seems to speak a language all its own. In fact it does, for it's clear Mr. Spielberg works in a purely cinematic idiom that is quite singular. Art and artifice play equal parts in the telling of this tale. And the latter, even though intrusive at times, is part and parcel of the film's overriding style.Yes, when Jim crawls through swampy waters he emerges covered with movie mud, the makeup man's kind; when he hits his head, he bleeds movie blood. It's hard not to be distracted by such things. But it's also hard to be deterred by them, since that same movie-conscious spirit in Mr. Spielberg gives ''Empire of the Sun'' a visual splendor, a heroic adventurousness and an immense scope that make it unforgettable.There are sections of ''Empire of the Sun'' that are so visually expressive they barely require dialogue (although Tom Stoppard's screenplay, which streamlines J. G. Ballard's autobiographical novel, is often crisp and clever). Its first half hour, for example, could exist as a silent film -an extraordinarily sharp evocation of Shanghai's last prewar days, richly detailed and colored by an exquisite foreboding. Jim is first seen singing in a church choir (the Welsh hymn ''Suo Gan'' will echo again hauntingly later in the story), then gliding through crowded streets in his family's chauffeur- driven Packard. At home, he asks his parents off-handed questions about the coming war. When the three of them, elaborately costumed, heedlessly leave home for a party on the other side of the city, it's clear that their days there are numbered just from the way the Chinese servants wave goodbye.That first glimpse of the choirboys will prompt audiences to wonder which of these well-groomed, proper little singers is to be the film's leading man. Mr. Bale, who emerges from the choir by singing a solo, at first seems just a handsome and malleable young performer, another charming child star. But the epic street scene that details the Japanese invasion of the city and separates Jim from his parents reveals this boy to be something more. As Mr. Bale, standing atop a car amid thousands of extras and clasping his hands to his head, registers the fact that Jim is suddenly alone, he conveys the schoolboy's real terror and takes the film to a different dramatic plane. This fine young actor, who appears in virtually every frame of the film and ages convincingly from about 9 to 13 during the course of the story, is eminently able to handle an ambitious and demanding role.But other episodes are less sharply defined. When Jim, who has proudly won his right to live in the American barracks, returns to the British camp in which he formerly lived, it takes a moment to remember why he's back - not because the motive is unclear, but because his departure from the one place and return to the other are separated by intervening scenes.Still, there are many glorious moments here, among them Jim's near- religious experiences with the fighter planes he sees as halfway divine (in one nighttime scene, the sparks literally fly). And there is a full panoply of supporting characters, including Miranda Richardson, who grows more beautiful as her spirits fade, in the role of a married English woman who both mothers Jim and arouses his early amorous stirrings. It is the mothering that seems to matter most, for Jim's small satchel of memorabilia includes a magazine photograph of a happy family, a picture he takes with him everywhere. For a surrogate father, he finds the trickier figure of Basie (John Malkovich), a Yank wheeler-dealer with a sly Dickensian wit. Basie, who by turns befriends Jim and disappoints him, remains an elusive character, but Mr. Malkovich brings a lot of fire to the role. ''American, are you?'' one of his British fellow prisoners asks this consummate operator. ''Definitely,'' Mr. Malkovich says.''Gone With the Wind'' is playing at the biggest movie theater in Shanghai when the Japanese are seen invading that city, and ''Gone With the Wind'' is a useful comparison, at least in terms of subject and style. The makers of that film didn't really burn Atlanta; that wasn't their method. They, too, as Mr. Spielberg does, let the score sometimes trumpet the characters' emotions unnecessarily, and they might well have staged something as crazy as the ''Empire of the Sun'' scene in which the prisoners find an outdoor stadium filled with confiscated art and antiques and automobiles, loot that's apparently been outdoors for a while but doesn't look weatherbeaten in the slightest. Does it matter? Not in the face of this film's grand ambitions and its moments of overwhelming power. Not in the light of its soaring spirits, its larger authenticity, and the great and small triumphs that it steadily delivers.

And the latter, even though intrusive at times, is part and parcel of the film's overriding style.Yes, when Jim crawls through swampy waters he emerges covered with movie mud, the makeup man's kind; when he hits his head, he bleeds movie blood. It's hard not to be distracted by such things. But it's also hard to be deterred by them, since that same movie-conscious spirit in Mr. Spielberg gives ''Empire of the Sun'' a visual splendor, a heroic adventurousness and an immense scope that make it unforgettable.There are sections of ''Empire of the Sun'' that are so visually expressive they barely require dialogue (although Tom Stoppard's screenplay, which streamlines J. G. Ballard's autobiographical novel, is often crisp and clever). Its first half hour, for example, could exist as a silent film -an extraordinarily sharp evocation of Shanghai's last prewar days, richly detailed and colored by an exquisite foreboding. Jim is first seen singing in a church choir (the Welsh hymn ''Suo Gan'' will echo again hauntingly later in the story), then gliding through crowded streets in his family's chauffeur- driven Packard. At home, he asks his parents off-handed questions about the coming war. When the three of them, elaborately costumed, heedlessly leave home for a party on the other side of the city, it's clear that their days there are numbered just from the way the Chinese servants wave goodbye.That first glimpse of the choirboys will prompt audiences to wonder which of these well-groomed, proper little singers is to be the film's leading man. Mr. Bale, who emerges from the choir by singing a solo, at first seems just a handsome and malleable young performer, another charming child star. But the epic street scene that details the Japanese invasion of the city and separates Jim from his parents reveals this boy to be something more. As Mr. Bale, standing atop a car amid thousands of extras and clasping his hands to his head, registers the fact that Jim is suddenly alone, he conveys the schoolboy's real terror and takes the film to a different dramatic plane. This fine young actor, who appears in virtually every frame of the film and ages convincingly from about 9 to 13 during the course of the story, is eminently able to handle an ambitious and demanding role.But other episodes are less sharply defined. When Jim, who has proudly won his right to live in the American barracks, returns to the British camp in which he formerly lived, it takes a moment to remember why he's back - not because the motive is unclear, but because his departure from the one place and return to the other are separated by intervening scenes.Still, there are many glorious moments here, among them Jim's near- religious experiences with the fighter planes he sees as halfway divine (in one nighttime scene, the sparks literally fly). And there is a full panoply of supporting characters, including Miranda Richardson, who grows more beautiful as her spirits fade, in the role of a married English woman who both mothers Jim and arouses his early amorous stirrings. It is the mothering that seems to matter most, for Jim's small satchel of memorabilia includes a magazine photograph of a happy family, a picture he takes with him everywhere. For a surrogate father, he finds the trickier figure of Basie (John Malkovich), a Yank wheeler-dealer with a sly Dickensian wit. Basie, who by turns befriends Jim and disappoints him, remains an elusive character, but Mr. Malkovich brings a lot of fire to the role. ''American, are you?'' one of his British fellow prisoners asks this consummate operator. ''Definitely,'' Mr. Malkovich says.''Gone With the Wind'' is playing at the biggest movie theater in Shanghai when the Japanese are seen invading that city, and ''Gone With the Wind'' is a useful comparison, at least in terms of subject and style. The makers of that film didn't really burn Atlanta; that wasn't their method. They, too, as Mr. Spielberg does, let the score sometimes trumpet the characters' emotions unnecessarily, and they might well have staged something as crazy as the ''Empire of the Sun'' scene in which the prisoners find an outdoor stadium filled with confiscated art and antiques and automobiles, loot that's apparently been outdoors for a while but doesn't look weatherbeaten in the slightest. Does it matter? Not in the face of this film's grand ambitions and its moments of overwhelming power. Not in the light of its soaring spirits, its larger authenticity, and the great and small triumphs that it steadily delivers.

But of course as others have pointed out, it is not just about food, but about two brothers and their pride for Italian cuisine, which has little impact in a empty classical restaurant in Jersey Shore. They painstakingly prepare a pasta and seafood risotto for a rare customer, but she would rather have spaghetti and meatballs - a grotesque combination, according to the master chef and older brother Primo. A little ways down the road, a much more successful 'Italian' restaurant specialises in this sort of dish, and is immensely popular for it, and so the snobbery of Primo is a little sympathetic and endearing because he clearly cares about his art, and could easily concede and go work for Pascal, or start his own line of spaghetti and meatballs. When Secondo visits Pascal's, we get the feeling that it is a regular destination for him, for another plea for assistance or a loan, yet he marvels every time at the success that his own restaurant cannot attain. The camera swivels around the entire joint in amazement, visiting every table (but not presenting the food with nearly as much importance as Paradise does), every satisfied customer in an unbroken shot, bathed in a red luxurious glow, and this is very reminiscent of the famous long take in Goodfellas (I got egg noodles and ketchup!). If this was a comedy it would be quick to establish both restaurants, and it would pit them against each other and clearly define Pascal as an antagonist and they would trade blows and acts of comedic sabotage. But they embrace, and their shared heritage enables not a loan, but a favour. Much of this film has the Italian Americans fumbling for words, for the right expression of meaning, but behind the hand gestures and stutters we see a intimate sense of camaraderie and friendliness. Primo stumbles around smalltalk with the local florist, Ann, whom he is attempting to romance, but the smile of Alison Janey is all that we need to confirm that is is just a matter of time. A lamp protruding into the middle of the frame provides a measuring line for the downtrodden vs the successful, but Pascal settles to Secondo's level and they reminisce of old times. They show their friendship, without ever having to describe it as one of those things...you know...the ships in the storm, with the lights. The camera-work is just perfectly intimate and showcases their love for their craft. To the lively soundtrack of an upbeat Italian guitar tune, we witness a montage from a bird's eye view; close-ups of eggs being cracked, flour being mixed, dough being kneaded, each roll of pasta being lovingly and carefully sculptured. Elmiger cuts on the action, but shows us enough of each sequential step of the recipe, so it becomes a fluid, stop-motion like process from the two brothers. Later as the feast is being devoured, we get reactions shots of each guest's sigh of contentment, each full belly, and each gasp of surprise at an entire garnished pig being wheeled out. And after that, and the timpano, and the soup, and each course loudly announced by the white on black title cards, we get a slow dolly that unveils each dinner guest at the table, completely stuffed, and Gabriella and Cristiano the waiter swiveling on the spot to soft piano. He is a vital member of the restaurant; he dances playfully, he eats silently with them, he even loyally falls asleep on the kitchen tabletop after the big night. In the singular crane shot, he steps out for a smoke, and the entire street is slowly revealed, the lonely red neon sign of Paradise blinking against the cruel blue night. He embodies the small-time Italian establishment with so much character, without speaking a single word. In the climatic scene on the beach we have two arguments, first Secondo frustrated at his brother's unwillingness to compromise, of his head and mind being ever stuck in the kitchens, then Primo, who is clearly unhappy in such a foreign and unappreciative world. And like throughout the film, they struggle to find the words necessary to convey their feelings, and must switch to their natural Italian, to finally release those bubbling emotions. The authenticity of this scene lies in both of their cases having merit, and the little details that emerge that tell us so much about their difficult relationship. Primo has to physically pin his brother down in the sand, as if he has failed to be heard for so many times, and later, after his furious tirade, Secondo vehemently defends and is fiercely protective of his brother, fully aware of his talent; he will not let Pascal steal him and turn him into a spaghetti and meatballs chef. There are no easy answers here, no quick remedy for this conflict. They have spent their savings on the big night, and the kitchen is nearly devoid of any ingredients. The loyal Cristiano stays, and Secondo wordlessly starts whipping up a plain and modest omelette, to be shared. And when Primo enters, he too gets a share. This silent, unbroken long take is tremendous because it is able to sum up the entirety of their journey, of striving to create true cuisine in the uncaring world, of seeking independence, of being able to cook for themselves and share with others their food. A hand is placed on the shoulder of a brother, and that tells us more than any apologies or words of affection could.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"7 November 2015","score":"","review":" If Big Night doesn't make you hungry, then no film will. But of course as others have pointed out, it is not just about food, but about two brothers and their pride for Italian cuisine, which has little impact in a empty classical restaurant in Jersey Shore. They painstakingly prepare a pasta and seafood risotto for a rare customer, but she would rather have spaghetti and meatballs - a grotesque combination, according to the master chef and older brother Primo. A little ways down the road, a much more successful 'Italian' restaurant specialises in this sort of dish, and is immensely popular for it, and so the snobbery of Primo is a little sympathetic and endearing because he clearly cares about his art, and could easily concede and go work for Pascal, or start his own line of spaghetti and meatballs. When Secondo visits Pascal's, we get the feeling that it is a regular destination for him, for another plea for assistance or a loan, yet he marvels every time at the success that his own restaurant cannot attain. The camera swivels around the entire joint in amazement, visiting every table (but not presenting the food with nearly as much importance as Paradise does), every satisfied customer in an unbroken shot, bathed in a red luxurious glow, and this is very reminiscent of the famous long take in Goodfellas (I got egg noodles and ketchup!). If this was a comedy it would be quick to establish both restaurants, and it would pit them against each other and clearly define Pascal as an antagonist and they would trade blows and acts of comedic sabotage. But they embrace, and their shared heritage enables not a loan, but a favour. Much of this film has the Italian Americans fumbling for words, for the right expression of meaning, but behind the hand gestures and stutters we see a intimate sense of camaraderie and friendliness. Primo stumbles around smalltalk with the local florist, Ann, whom he is attempting to romance, but the smile of Alison Janey is all that we need to confirm that is is just a matter of time. A lamp protruding into the middle of the frame provides a measuring line for the downtrodden vs the successful, but Pascal settles to Secondo's level and they reminisce of old times. They show their friendship, without ever having to describe it as one of those things...you know...the ships in the storm, with the lights. The camera-work is just perfectly intimate and showcases their love for their craft. To the lively soundtrack of an upbeat Italian guitar tune, we witness a montage from a bird's eye view; close-ups of eggs being cracked, flour being mixed, dough being kneaded, each roll of pasta being lovingly and carefully sculptured. Elmiger cuts on the action, but shows us enough of each sequential step of the recipe, so it becomes a fluid, stop-motion like process from the two brothers. Later as the feast is being devoured, we get reactions shots of each guest's sigh of contentment, each full belly, and each gasp of surprise at an entire garnished pig being wheeled out. And after that, and the timpano, and the soup, and each course loudly announced by the white on black title cards, we get a slow dolly that unveils each dinner guest at the table, completely stuffed, and Gabriella and Cristiano the waiter swiveling on the spot to soft piano. He is a vital member of the restaurant; he dances playfully, he eats silently with them, he even loyally falls asleep on the kitchen tabletop after the big night. In the singular crane shot, he steps out for a smoke, and the entire street is slowly revealed, the lonely red neon sign of Paradise blinking against the cruel blue night. He embodies the small-time Italian establishment with so much character, without speaking a single word. In the climatic scene on the beach we have two arguments, first Secondo frustrated at his brother's unwillingness to compromise, of his head and mind being ever stuck in the kitchens, then Primo, who is clearly unhappy in such a foreign and unappreciative world. And like throughout the film, they struggle to find the words necessary to convey their feelings, and must switch to their natural Italian, to finally release those bubbling emotions. The authenticity of this scene lies in both of their cases having merit, and the little details that emerge that tell us so much about their difficult relationship. Primo has to physically pin his brother down in the sand, as if he has failed to be heard for so many times, and later, after his furious tirade, Secondo vehemently defends and is fiercely protective of his brother, fully aware of his talent; he will not let Pascal steal him and turn him into a spaghetti and meatballs chef. There are no easy answers here, no quick remedy for this conflict. They have spent their savings on the big night, and the kitchen is nearly devoid of any ingredients. The loyal Cristiano stays, and Secondo wordlessly starts whipping up a plain and modest omelette, to be shared. And when Primo enters, he too gets a share. This silent, unbroken long take is tremendous because it is able to sum up the entirety of their journey, of striving to create true cuisine in the uncaring world, of seeking independence, of being able to cook for themselves and share with others their food.

I mean, the story tells us that there's a star - A STAR! - approaching the earth that's eventually going to collide with our planet and destroy us. A STAR!! Well, stars are pretty darn hot, you know. But as this one gets close to earth, our little blue planet doesn't really seem to heat up. I mean, this star called Bellus is called at one point a giant star - even though it's described as only a dozen times bigger than the earth, which actually makes it a lot smaller than the sun as well as a few of the larger planets in our solar system. But surely it would still be hot - if only because it's a star! Oh well. Go figure.It's 50's sci-fi. You can't take it too seriously. Some call this a sci-fi classic. I wouldn't go that far. In fact, I didn't even think it was especially good. Certainly, I've seen 50's sci-fi stuff that was more enjoyable. The attempts at science really threw me. When Bellus and its planet Zyra are discovered, it was noted that they had moved a million miles in two weeks. Which doesn't really seem that fast to me in interstellar terms. I wondered how this star approaching our solar system could have gone unnoticed until it was only three billion miles away (which would have put it well within the bounds of our own solar system.) A lot just seemed pretty strange. Of course, it might have just been that George Pal and his pals who made this realized that your average movie goer in 1951 probably wasn't all that up on astronomy, so they figured they could get away with it. It just bothered me all the way through, though.So, basically, this is a doomsday movie - and it's even introduced with a reference to the story of Noah and the ark from the Bible. And it's replete with the scepticism that always surrounds doomsday preachers, with good reason since they've all been wrong so far. But Dr. Hendron isn't wrong. He knows. Bellus will crush us unless we figure out a way to - well - get out of the way. So, conveniently, Bellus has this planet Zyra that might be able to support human life, so - what the heck - even though we only have a few months we'll build a giant spaceship and transport a few dozen people (and some puppies to make the little boy who hitched a ride happy) to this new world. OK.

One night, A serial killer named Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif ) is shot to death in a toy store by Officer Mike Norris ( Chris Sarandon ). Before he dies, Charles transfers his soul into a doll using voodoo magic. He is soon bought by Karen Barclay, (Catherine Hicks) a single mother who gives it to her son, Andy (Alex Vincent) who has just turned six. Most people would probably remember Chucky as that wise-cracking, ridiculous slasher villain, but that is not the case in this movie. For the first half of the movie Chucky is not seen walking or talking, but there are killings that are happening. This is quite suspenseful for the first half while Chucky just sits there and only kills by sneak attacks. These killings are blamed on Andy as he happens to be at all the crime scenes.Andy is an alright character. He is likable enough and never becomes too annoying, but he just does not have any personality traits that are interesting. Andy does have this one liner near the end of the film that is just hilarious.Andy's mother (Karen) and the cop Mike Norris are also just okay. They are also not annoying or badly acted, but they also lack any real personality. They play the role of the adults not believing the kid and that's all for the first half. Chucky is the most notable character in the film. The doll special effects are done pretty good, not as good as they were in later films, but not bad. Brad Dourif's Chucky voice is really memorable and really makes the character of Chucky come to life. Now that Chucky is a doll he believes that he is invincible, and so he plans get revenge on the people who have wronged him. With Andy's help getting him there; he goes into his partner's house to kill him because his partner left him for dead. After doing this and Andy is sent to a mental hospital, Chucky goes to see his old voodoo master so that he can find out how to get out of the dolls body. After Chucky voodoo's his teacher into submission, Chucky learns that he will have to transfer himself into Andy's body. That is his goal for the last half of the movie. Although Chucky is a slasher villain, the movie does not follow the slasher formula that was established by Halloween. It is not about a man in a mask stalking people or the body count, but about Chucky's journey as a man, then as a doll, then revenge and finally becoming human again. The body count is not very high, but the kills that they do have are spread out throughout the movie, so it never feels like the film goes to long without a murder or attempted murder. Unfortunately, most of the kills are a little too ridiculous, even for the 80's. A babysitter is killed (familiar?) early on by getting hit by a plastic hammer and she comically reels backwards and JUMPS out a window. Just Silly. These stupid kills are made up for with the scene where Chucky is in the backseat trying to strangle Mike Norris while stabbing though the seat. Mike keeps stepping on the gas and the whole scene just gets intense. The music is a haunting score, especially the opening music. The theme fits the film and makes the still doll seem more sinister then he is. While the score sounds great, it's just not as an iconic or recognizable as the Halloween or Friday The 13th theme. The movie ends with Chucky being set on fire and getting some of his limbs shot off, Chucky is shot in the heart killing him. But what's this? Andy looks back at the served parts of Chucky and sees&#x85;. That he is still there. Ambiguous ending that is not that ambiguous&#x85; Whoa.

It's the kind of film that probably needs to be seen several times to understand, but its enjoyable even the first time thanks to the imagery and atmosphere it can create. Instead of a traditional plot, this movie speaks through symbols, again much like a poem. Rather than following any linear story, the scenes are taken from various places in time featuring a handful of characters, and other scenes taken from documentaries spliced in between.One of the most interesting elements is the camera. It moves like a ghost throughout the movie- gently gliding across extended single shot scenes, and sliding across characters and their reflections. Interestingly it maintains this effect when its shown from the first person, and other characters are addressing the character whose point of view were looking from. This is why I said the camera is like a ghost, because most of the movie is filmed like this it's as if this character behind the camera is always there, which is even made possible because the camera is capable of walking across dream-like sequences as readily as real ones.One of the earliest scenes in the movie is of this time, and summarizes why this movie is so engrossing. After the scene of a house burning down in the rain, there is one of a woman washing her hair, which is ordinary on the surface but a very eerie atmosphere is created because of her very slow movements and the hair covering her face. The tension is brought up dramatically from the surroundings walls scarred by flames but dripping with moisture. A connection is made to the burned down house from earlier, and later scenes in the movie take place in buildings with similar walls. Links such as these between disparate scenes of the movie create this impression of a poem, where all these separate elements where put in place to create a single meaning, but what that is is largely up to the audience to discover.There are many more examples throughout, but that is just a glimpse of the atmosphere that makes this movie so interesting to watch even the first time.

It's the kind of film that probably needs to be seen several times to understand, but its enjoyable even the first time thanks to the imagery and atmosphere it can create. Instead of a traditional plot, this movie speaks through symbols, again much like a poem. Rather than following any linear story, the scenes are taken from various places in time featuring a handful of characters, and other scenes taken from documentaries spliced in between.One of the most interesting elements is the camera. It moves like a ghost throughout the movie- gently gliding across extended single shot scenes, and sliding across characters and their reflections. Interestingly it maintains this effect when its shown from the first person, and other characters are addressing the character whose point of view were looking from. This is why I said the camera is like a ghost, because most of the movie is filmed like this it's as if this character behind the camera is always there, which is even made possible because the camera is capable of walking across dream-like sequences as readily as real ones.One of the earliest scenes in the movie is of this time, and summarizes why this movie is so engrossing. After the scene of a house burning down in the rain, there is one of a woman washing her hair, which is ordinary on the surface but a very eerie atmosphere is created because of her very slow movements and the hair covering her face. The tension is brought up dramatically from the surroundings walls scarred by flames but dripping with moisture. A connection is made to the burned down house from earlier, and later scenes in the movie take place in buildings with similar walls.

Joker, who is also the narrator of the film. What does it take to transform a normal human being into a remorseless assassin? Full Metal Jacket is Kubrick's attempt to answer that question.Full Metal Jacket is a two segments story. The first one concerns a new batch of US Marine Corps recruits who arrive at Parris Island for training under the command of Sgt. Hartman, their strict, disciplined & foul-mouthed senior drill inspector. Hartman employs a rigorous training regimen to turn his recruits into marines ready for combat and is severely harsh on a dim-witted & overweight recruit whom he nicknames Pvt. Pyle. The second part follows Joker, one of the recruits, and covers his harrowing experience in Vietnam.Co-written, produced & directed by Stanley Kubrick, Full Metal Jacket is definitely amongst the finest depictions of dehumanization on film canvas and works perfectly on many levels. Kubrick's direction is absolutely flawless in the first half but it stumbles slightly in the next half only to rise again during its nail-biting climax to finish on a high note. Cinematography has always been influential in Kubrick's films & this one is no exception. And with all things considered, it easily qualifies as one of the most technically sound examples of its genre.Coming to the performances, Full Metal Jacket features many unforgettable characters and Matthew Modine, Vincent D'Onofrio & R. Lee Ermey do terrific job in their given roles which elevates the film to a much better status than it would've been otherwise. Modine plays Pvt. Joker, who joined the US Marine Corps to see combat and the film is, on a superficial level, his story only. D'Onofrio devotes himself completely to his character of Pvt. Pyle and does a remarkable job in illustrating the transition of his character from a naive & clumsy recruit to a pure psychopath.But the real highlight amongst the entire cast is Lee Ermey as drill inspector Sgt. Hartman and thanks to his powerful, intense & show-stealing rendition, his performance easily ranks amongst the most dominating, memorable & extraordinary portrayals in cinema history. He is extremely punishing, mean, sarcastic & clever but when one considers his job of turning random men into heartless killers so that they can survive the horrors of war, the character of Hartman becomes fully justified. And out of all the amazing characters in Kubrick's films, Sgt. Hartman is undoubtedly my favourite.The entire film, on a closer look, is a study of duality. The two segments this film is divided into are completely different in their plot & treatment. The characters, during their arrival in Vietnam, are neither entirely compassionate humans nor cold-hearted assassins and seem to be battling moral dilemmas. Pvt. Joker wears a peace symbol on his jacket while Born to Kill is written on his helmet. And there are many more references of duality such as that. Pointlessness of war, military brainwashing & dehumanization are other themes it deals with and all of these are addressed in an expert manner.On an overall scale, there are very few war films out there which so meticulously depict the gruesome effects war has on human psyche and Full Metal Jacket is unquestionably one of them. The first half of this film clearly outshines the second half in almost every filmmaking department because of which it may disappoint some viewers. But it has all the trademarks of a Kubrick masterpiece and remains one of his most entertaining works. In Joker's words, it tells how important a human life is & how lucky it is to be alive and, on the whole, it's one of Stanley Kubrick's most tightly crafted films that is aesthetic, artistic & influential in every possible manner.
