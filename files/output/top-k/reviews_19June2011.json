The Cider House Rules begins with review of our main characters, Homer Wells played by Toby Maguire, life up to the point of him living in an orphanage as a sort of father figure to the others. The head Doctor and program director for the orphanage is Dr. Wilbur Larch, played by Michael Caine, who provides a consistent and safe environment for the children. As Homer is taught under the care of Dr Larch a young couple, Candy and Wally played by Charlize Theron and Paul Rudd, come in to the orphanage to receive an abortion. Homer, wanting to experience life, asks to ride along with them and so the story takes off as he attempts to experience life and catch up on everything that he feels he has missed.In this film we follow Homer as he attempts to experience all that life has to offer. I believe that we can all relate to Homer's sense of adventure and openness to life. As Homer and Candy begin an intimate relationship we can remember the excitement and youth that they are experiencing. Even while Candy and Homer are forced to part ways due to obligation, we see the heart break in both of their eyes. I see similarities in this film and Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, as a young love is broken apart, not by choice, but by confusion and obligation.I found many significant cinematographically based techniques throughout this film that set the mood and reinforced the story line. With the nurses and doctors in the orphanage we see them in nothing other than white. This white gives a sense of dullness and safety. Homer would live a simple, safe life if he were to stay at the orphanage. On the other side, we see Candy and Wally ride in with a new flashy green car, as Candy is wearing bright red lipstick. Wally and Candy represent life and risk, which Homer grasps on to as it drives him from the orphanage out in to the world. The other technique that the producer and cinematographers use is angles. When the orphanage is shown, we are always looking up the hill at it, almost in a majestic manner. On the other end, when we see images of the train leaving the orphanage or views of the orchard we see a downward camera view, almost demeaning in purpose. Both of these techniques help the producer display their meaning to the audience with small visual underlining. Throughout the film it is fairly evident that Homer will, eventually, return back to the orphanage due to the manner with which we view the origin. We view the orphanage as home and never see Homer settle in anywhere else. That is also why we have a deep feeling that Homer will find heartbreak in the arms of Candy, as he experiences the greatness and misery of life.

After finding his identity Jason Bourne (Damon) and leaving the bank Bourne asks a women for a ride. Refusing his request she is forced to reconsider once Bourne offers a large payment in cash. Finally convincing Marie (Potente) to drive him, the two travel together in search of all the clues to his past, but not without multiple problems and attempts from assassins to end their lives.Lighting throughout the film has a dark effect to it, even throughout the daytime scenes. Based in the winter, the snow slightly brightens the scenes throughout the daytime shots, but the lighting is never bright until the ending scene when Marie and Bourne reunite in Greece. The darkness of the movies follows the darkness of Jason Bourne, from not knowing his identity to learning of his occupation, Darkness follows Bourne. The cinematic point of view throughout most of the film that the director chose to use is indirect-subjective. We are close to the action enough to get an emotional effect from the scenes. In the scene where Bourne and Marie reunite the director uses a subjective point of view, switching between the eyes of Jason Bourne and Marie as the looks at one another.While The Bourne Identity is based mostly on action, drama, and mystery, the writers added in some romance between Jason Bourne and Marie.

It follows Guy (Frank Whaley) who is a clean-shaven enthusiastic new recruit into this unique world landing himself a job as the personal assistant to Buddy Ackerman (Kevin Spacey) an expletive throwing repugnant studio executive whose addition to your CV opens every door imaginable but is counteracted so much by his demeanour that many would find it not worth the trouble.Guy seems to have the determination to see it through helped by script writer and love interest Dawn (Michelle Forbes) but after working for the man for over a year, cracks begin to surface and Guy is finally pushed too far showing up at Buddy's home in the middle of the night intent on revenge. What plays out over the 100 minutes is a mixture between the past year of his life and the present unfolding situation.This was George Huang's first (and it would seem only notable) foray into the world of writing and directing and credit must be given to him. The script is impressive with Whaley engrossing himself into the character topped only by Spacey's exceptional performance where he looks set to star in a similar, albeit toned down, role in Horrible Bosses. He not only excels in many of his 'throwing a tantrum' scenes but somehow brings sympathy and compassion to a character that we should not feel anything for. Even when being held hostage he emits a certain smug arrogance that would be misplaced in any other character apart from this one.I felt conflicted given the knowledge at the beginning that Guy kidnaps his boss. It somewhat limits the sympathy you can show towards him regardless of finding out what Buddy did to drive him to such lengths.I wouldn't class this as a comedy per say as this is not going to have you laughing a great deal but rather an extremely dark satire of life in Hollywood and the means required to keep your head above the water.

The pot is a huge sum of money and the only rule that you follow the rules of the man that set up the contest, Herod.Herod is also the owner, leader, and ruler of the town. Seems he's arranged this little gun-show-off so that the preacher (who use to be an outlaw and rode with Herod) will have to fight again.Cort refuses to ever use a gun to kill again and Herod, acknowledging Cort as one of the best, is determined to alter this line of thinking ... even if it gets someone killed ...This little cult classic was unfairly overlooked when released, probably because Stones name was over the title.

The location of where this film was to take place is off a secluded island in Costa Rica. This isolated island (Jurassic Park) was the home of prehistoric dinosaurs that were brought back into present time by dino blood that was preserved from insects that existed in that time period. The main characters that were visitors of Jurassic Park are the following Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neil), Tim Murphy (Joseph Mazzello), Lex Murphy (Ariana Richards), Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and Robert Muldoon (Bob Peck). These seven characters listed above endure many obstacles and not all of them make it off the island alive. The founder of Jurassic Park is John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) and he explains the process of how these extinct animals are brought back into the modern world. The theme for this film in my opinion is that technological advances may unlock many unanswered questions about our past; however some answers should be left unknown. One of the most powerful and memorable scenes is when Tim and Lex Murphy are sitting in the Jurassic Park jeep when the cup of water starts to shake. The look in these children's eye says it all. When they are left behind by Robert Muldoon, it was clear to the audience that these characters were left in the wilderness with the largest predators known by man-kind. The lighting in this scene was perfect. The dark and wet night really set off the emotional foundation and had the viewer's feeling the fear of the characters. Although there are many scenes in this film that show great use of angles, one of those scenes really jump out at me when watching the film. The scene when Dr. Grant and Tim are stuck in a tree well inside the forest of Jurassic Park. They must abandon the Jeep because it was not going to stay in the tree much longer. The angles in this scene are phenomenal, especially when they find themselves racing to the base of the tree before the Jeep crushes both of them. The angle that is underneath the characters as well as the falling vehicle really grabs the viewers' attention and puts the real life fear right into ones living room. Jurassic Park and Multiplicity are two films that express technological advances that show us future advancements are not always positive. Even though Multiplicity is not full of danger and action, it does show us technological advances in cloning can cause many issues in the near future. This film is based off of the unknown factor of what the world was like in the prehistoric age. Technological advances made some individuals feel they were capable of producing prehistoric elements and re-create them. Although they succeeded at producing the extinct animals, technological advances could not account for the dangers that lied ahead.

Patton is a wonder to behold here. It's rare that an actor can take control of a character to the degree Scott does in this film, so much so that he literally becomes Patton. It was interesting to listen to Francis Ford Coppola's remarks on the 20th Century Fox DVD presentation, talking about his research into the General's life. Coppola utilized Patton's belief in reincarnation to write the scene where he discussed the Roman defeat of the Carthaginians in North Africa. A complex character, Patton was a God fearing man who could curse up a storm, and mete out scorn for a coward and empathy for a battle scarred soldier in equal measure. The film uses those kinds of moments to demonstrate the essence of a man who was literally born to battle because he 'loved it so'.Coming off a recent viewing of Band of Brothers, this picture helped put in perspective part of Patton's grand strategy in Europe during World War II. With the 101st Airborne pinned down in the area of Bastogne, France, Patton's near impossible march of a hundred days with little in the way of food and war supplies was deemed a master stroke. He made the impossible look like a minor inconvenience.With the passage of time, it's apparent that Patton's personal philosophy becomes more and more anachronistic. All real Americans love the sting of battle is not an idea that's championed today, even when conveyed with Patton's passion for achievement in competition from a young age. Can you imagine a general like him testifying before Congress explaining how he'll cut out the enemies' living guts and use them to grease the treads of our tanks? Granted, George Patton was the product of a different era, but it's prudent that we pay respect and honor to men like him, and the men who served under him, for the freedoms we still cherish today.

In my opinion, it's somewhere in between. They are neither victims or demons, and as one other reviewer pointed out here, they choose to be what they are. No one forces it upon them. It's through their own fault. Take films such as Trainspotting and Requiem for a Dream. Both of these films are about heroin addicts, but the characters don't obtain our sympathy because they either choose the life out of boredom and frustration, or because they are greedy and reckless. Those films generate our sympathy for the characters through different ways, but the bottom line is they DO manage to obtain our sympathy. This film starring Sandra Bullock about rehab is one of the first of it's kind that I've seen. I'm no expert, but I've always imagined rehab to be a pretty dreary and depressing place - almost like prison - if your an addict trying to kick something - but this pretentious and unrealistic film doesn't know whether or not it's trying to make a hard-hitting emotionally and honest drama, or a stupid light-hearted comedy. It tries to be both, and ends up been a horrifying and stupid mess that just tells us how it's director and writer didn't have the grapes to make a depressing, honest real-life film.Bullock plays Gwen, an alcoholic who enjoys life with her binge-drinking party animal boyfriend. She doesn't realise she has a problem- she is just enjoying life as far as she is concerned. But when she arrives at her sisters wedding and gets drunk and after she destroys the wedding cake and makes a degrading and embarrassing speech that could ruin the marriage that is only hours old, she steals a limo and drives recklessly before crashing it through the front of someone's house. It's a miracle that she doesn't injure or kill anyone. The judge gives her an ultimatum - go to prison or go to 28 days of rehab. She picks rehab, thinking it will be a picnic. But how wrong she is, because when she gets there, she realises how messed up her life is and she is now determined - after an escape attempt - to set herself straight.Probably the only merit I can see in this film is a brilliant performance from the great Steve Buscemi (Resevoir Dogs, Con Air, Heart). But unfortunately, his screen-time is limited. Bullock is completely out of place here and seems to get so self-absorbed with her role that she subsequently becomes her contemptuous character. The script is awful, and goes all over the place. One minute it's a serious drama, and the next it's a light-hearted housewife comedy. To even have considered making a comedy out of such a serious subject would be suicide. I know of a few people suffering from addictions, and it's definitely not something that can be made a joke of, or even worse, made into a light-hearted affair like this disgrace that Betty Thomas and Susannah Grant have churned out. I'd recommend avoiding this film, especially if you have suffered from addiction through it yourself, or through a close family member or friend. I rate both Trainspotting and Requiem for a Dream 10\/10, because those films portray addiction for what it is, how it destroys lives and ruins relationships......28 Days is immature and never seems to know what it's trying to do. The film tries to pin the root of Gwen's addiction onto her troubled childhood and her drug-addict mother. This is insulting if anything. A lot of people come from broken homes. That has nothing to do with them developing addictions, in fact, you'll find that many addicts come from privileged and comfortable backgrounds. Addiction has nothing to do with where you come from. It's to do with who you are.

This movie is my favorite movie of all time. You had to have seen it back in 89 to understand how brilliant it was. I was only 4 and I could tell it was a masterpiece. Every second of Elfman's score matches what you see on screen brilliantly. Every time you see Keaton's grin under the mask and that awesome batman logo on his suit it is a treat. This movie still has the best bat suit ever. It is so tough and rugged. Batman return suit was OK but 89s is still the most scary. In batman 89 you always have the perfect amount darkness around the suit to male it look perfect. Visually it is the most appealing movie I've ever seen up there with Psycho and Vertigo. Also Keaton has the toughest portrayal of batman. He stands up and boxes his enemies in a street fighting style which makes sense because all conflicts take place in street settings it is so satisfying when u see batman get to beat the crap out of Nicholson at the end and drop have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight. When batman spreads his wings at the beginning and that Elfman music kicks in it gives me chills. And of course Nicholson is amazing. This movie also works in the gangster genre. It angers me how good it is. Finally i would say the visual style is timeless. This movie was made in the late 80s but i see no 80s influences other than the cars. It will always be the 1940s in that world. Warner bros hiring Burton was genius. Great art direction, music, costumes, action, acting, and overall vision of batman there will ever be. I've watched it over 100 times and i never get bored with it. Burton has described the movie as operatic and i think that is really fitting.

John Wayne, Dean Martin, Earl Holliman (The Forbidden Planet), and Michael Anderson Jr. are the Elder sons who return to their mother's funeral, finding a town who wants no part of them. Wayne, as John Elder, is a known gunfighter while Martin's Tom has a warrant out for his arrest after an incident with a bartender in another town. The Elders are set up for the murder of Clearwater, Texas sheriff, Billy Wilson (Paul Fix, veteran of television), by a conniving, sneaky, no-good gun store owner, Morgan Hastings (character actor James Gregory, a veteran of television, particularly Barney Miller). Hastings is the one responsible for the murder of patriarch Bass Elder, resulting in the loss of land which left Katie without her home. The Elder sons attempt to right the wrongs orchestrated by Hastings.I admit that The Sons of Katie Elder isn't one of my favorite John Wayne westerns, certainly, in regards to his pairing with Dean Martin, not a patch to Rio Bravo. That said, I found it entertaining for what it was a story about four men trying to do right by their maw after a life of muddying the name Elder, especially John who is known for the bloodshed as a reputed gunfighter. Katie, a pacifist, loved John, but hated violence, and this provides motivation to try and do something (forcing youngster Bud (Anderson Jr.) to return to school and do Katie's memory justice) that would make her proud.Katie had a plan to raise cattle, so the Elders attempt to ride them to miners in the Rockies, but this plan is interrupted by Billy's replacement, the green deputy Ben (Jeremy Slate) who believes they were behind the sheriff's murder, even though this is hogwash considering the Elders were in Pecos receiving the cattle. George Kennedy has a memorable part as Gregory's hired gun, black hat and rattlesnake grin, who will help Hastings in his plan to snuff out the Elders as they are carried, bound in chains, by stagecoach across a bridge. This film also has an early role for Dennis Hopper as Hastings' nervy, sniveling son, Dave. Curiously, the film is absent a lot of action, except two sequences at the end, including a bridge blown apart by dynamite and a gun store exploded, with more emphasis on the Elders attempting to put aside their criminal pasts to restore their family name and allow Katie to have died with some dignity. The film does have a playful brawl between the brothers which erupts when an angered Bud (mad as hell that John didn't draw in a gunfight with Kennedy's Curly in a bar) provokes John inside Katie's old home. I will say that the gunfight at the end, where the Elders must fend off Hastings' men underneath the bridge, is quite thrilling, although, interesting enough, this normally results in the conclusion of the film, but is instead a precursor to the return to town so that John can have one final showdown with Hastings.

When the trial is over, he can't let her go...There are two big problems with this movie, they should have trimmed the ending by at least ten minutes, and Baldwin should not have got his motivation from the T-1000.There are times when he is so autonomous, you can almost hear the mechanics grinding in the background, which is a shame, because in the first act, he is really convincing, but when we find out he's the Teacher, it's as if he's expecting the audience to want him go that little more Psychotic.Moore is as good as she always is, convincing as the parent who is worried for her son's well being. But when Baldwin and Moore are on screen together, it just doesn't convince. You do think every now and again that they will get together at the end, but thats only because the fear factor that Baldwin had in the first act vanishes.Gandolfini is great in this movie though, and shows what a talent he is. Just a shame he isn't in the movie a lot more.There is some good camera-work and good performances, even from your token mobsters, who look like extras from Goodfellas.It's not a bad film, entirely watchable, just not plausible enough.

The legal requirements for service personnel prior to US entry into WWII are totally misquoted.Examples, the view of the bomb propeller spinning in the galley of the Arizona and then the bomb going off is impossible. This propeller (and one like it in the tail), is a safety. It operates by screwing itself off in the airstream as the bomb falls. If the bomb is stationary, the propeller will not spin and come off. Therefore the bomb will not go off.Additionally Fighter pilots in the US Army Air Corps, would not and could not fly bombers. The criteria for joining Doolittle's squadron was to be very proficient in the B25. No fighter pilot would have made the cut.Prior to WWII, service personnel who wanted to fight for any other country, had to totally resign from the US military. A naturalized citizen had to relinquish their US citizenship. This was due to the Neutrality Act.On top of that the love story is, at best,inane.I guess the writer and producer wanted to cut costs and omitted the Technical Advisers.

Modelling himself on Steve McQueen, Costner id everything you would expect him to be.Brooding at first, but eventually becoming a man with a heart of gold and being friends with everyone. But the real reason to watch this film is Houston, and to be fair on her, she isn't all that bad, but is as what you would expect, all attitude and 'mmmm hmmmm', until you discover that she has a heart of gold too. It's just that the two of them can't swallow their prides to tell each other how they feel, until the very last frame.And somewhere in the film, there is some plot about someone wanting to kill Houston with sarcasm and threatening letters, and it's not who it would seem.It's inoffensive stuff, very easy to watch and as equally enjoyable, just don't expect too many people to admit it.

While it lacks the power of the director's earlier AGUIRRE, WRATH OF GOD, this is nevertheless a compelling film of the type to be savoured It's a superbly judged movie in which every scene has been carefully created to contribute to the eerie atmosphere. It opens with a chilling pan over a number of real-life mummified bodies (actually filmed in Mexico) and from there throws us into a dark and compelling world. Kinski, so frequently Herzog's muse, is as good as Nosferatu as you'd expect, a mixture of the repellent, the pitiful and the disturbing. Isabelle Adjani makes for a suitably ethereal heroine, matching the best of the Hammer scream queens. Bruno Ganz, later to come to some acclaim for his performance as Hitler in DOWNFALL, gives one of the most interesting interpretations of Jonathan Harker that I've seen in an adaptation of the Stoker novel.In the end, though, it's Herzog himself who holds the attention here with a film that could be split into individual frames and sold for its artistic beauty. The highlight is undoubtedly the rat invasion halfway through, in which the streets are seething with vermin and townsfolk hold an impromptu last supper to celebrate.
