This film, although not the greatest work of cinema ever, is none the less much better in every way than the original three. I'll explain I'm not even going to talk about the special effects, because that goes without saying. The interaction of Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon is breath taking and extremely deep. Where we had mindless panic induced banter in the first three between Luke, Lea and Han we have two sober Jedi who move through this film much in the way that Kain moved through the original Kung-Fu series.Jar-Jar, although he is a little much, is nowhere NEAR as irritating as the slew of Muppets in Jaba's palace, to say nothing of the Ewoks which are just a travesty. Darth Maul... I could have used a bit more of him, but he is just too fantastic for words. We haven't had a character as cool as this yet. The plot is very complicated and convoluted. Where in the first three we had, more or less, good guys vs. bad guys, here we have this intricate political thing that is somewhat confusing but much more interesting to try and follow. So what's left to criticize? That we don't have Harrison Ford to be snide and cool? Well, so it goes. I can't imagine missing Luke with his endless whining and I could take or leave Lea any day. This film is magnificent. The story is rich, detailed and interesting. The characters are developed to a MUCH greater extent than the characters in the first three. Before you jump out of your seat arguing this point, think back to the original Star Wars... try, if you can, to forget that you have seen three movies 50 times. Try to imagine that you only saw Star Wars and all you know of these three monkeys is what you saw in this one film. Now tell me, did they develop Han, Lea and Luke better than the people in this film? You see Han in about 2 scenes where you learn ANYTHING about him. The rest of the time he is running around and shooting his blaster (badly) at storm troopers). Luke whines a lot, but that's basically all we get to see of him and Obi-Wan is dead so quickly that all we know is that he's a wise Jedi guy from the old days. The only character that you can say is developed is Darth Vader (which makes sense, cause now we know that the whole set of films is about him). But to say that the original movie developed the characters better is just loony. Watch the movie again, for the first time and you will see how wrong you are.Don't get me wrong.

Brooks, the story written by Mark Andrus brings up not only very interesting characters but also very interesting issues.  I have the video and enjoy watching it. The CD is great with music of Nat King Cole, Shawn Colkin. Outstanding acting by Helen Hunt (Mad About You, Twister) who won an Oscar for this role where she plays Carol Connelly, a single mother, working as waitress in Manhattan, New York. A single parent trying to cope with her work and paying medical bills for son Spencer Connelly, played by  Jesse James (Message in a Bottle, The Gingerbread Men, Gods and Monsters). Jack Nicholson (A Few Good Men, Easy Rider, Witches of Eastwick)  is Melvin Udall who is an obsessive compulsive.  Nicholson also won an Oscar for his part. His obsessive compulsiveness has taken over his life and he is not able to live a normal life.  Melvin Udall  has tons of soap all organized in his medicine cabinet.  He uses a bar of soap once and then throws it out. He will not step on a crack on the side walk but skips to the next block of concrete. When he goes to the restaurant he brings his own plastic fork, knife and spoon in a plastic bag. Udall uses plastic gloves to hold the dog and has all his office supply stacked and all color coordinated in his home\/office. He eats at the same restaurant, sits at the same table, if someone is seating at his table he insults them to make them leave so that he has his table back, wants the same waiter Carol to wait on him, and takes forever to take a shower. He closes his door several times and counts how many times he has done it. As a writer who works at home I do understand Mr. Udall really well. Writers think somewhat like this we like to be alone with ourselves in order to think. We have to go inside ourselves to produce good work. It is a very isolated world. We do not like to be bothered unless we are bored, or tired, in which case we want to communicate with the outside world for a brief period of time, then after one hour or so we want to go back inside ourselves again and be left alone. This is somehow like Melvin thinks. People think that he has nothing to do and they keep knocking at his door and he gets really aggravated about that.  He is my favorite character in this movie, not to diminish the other ones. He is just so full on nuances that make him very entertaining. Helen's role is very, very, good and she did a really good job with it. Greg Kinnear (Sabrina) is Simon Bishop, the artist who is Udall's next door neighbor who finally has Melvin turning into a little more normal human being and he is there to teach him many life lessons.  The supporting actors are great,  you have Oscar winner Cuba Gooding Jr. (Jerry Maguire) playing Frank Sachs, Simon's agent.My favorite scenes elementary school kids all in uniform screaming Wait! Melvin,  wait! Greg Kinnear imitating Melvin. Melvin and Caroll going to eat fresh rolls in the wee hours of the morning. When Melvin realizes that the dog is also skipping cracks on the sidewalk.My favorite quote I am drowning  here and you are describing the water. This is a nice story telling movie. I recommend it!

Outstanding acting by Helen Hunt (Mad About You, Twister) who won an Oscar for this role where she plays Carol Connelly, a single mother, working as waitress in Manhattan, New York. A single parent trying to cope with her work and paying medical bills for son Spencer Connelly, played by  Jesse James (Message in a Bottle, The Gingerbread Men, Gods and Monsters). Jack Nicholson (A Few Good Men, Easy Rider, Witches of Eastwick)  is Melvin Udall who is an obsessive compulsive.  Nicholson also won an Oscar for his part. His obsessive compulsiveness has taken over his life and he is not able to live a normal life.  Melvin Udall  has tons of soap all organized in his medicine cabinet.  He uses a bar of soap once and then throws it out. He will not step on a crack on the side walk but skips to the next block of concrete. When he goes to the restaurant he brings his own plastic fork, knife and spoon in a plastic bag. Udall uses plastic gloves to hold the dog and has all his office supply stacked and all color coordinated in his home\/office. He eats at the same restaurant, sits at the same table, if someone is seating at his table he insults them to make them leave so that he has his table back, wants the same waiter Carol to wait on him, and takes forever to take a shower. He closes his door several times and counts how many times he has done it. As a writer who works at home I do understand Mr. Udall really well. Writers think somewhat like this we like to be alone with ourselves in order to think. We have to go inside ourselves to produce good work. It is a very isolated world. We do not like to be bothered unless we are bored, or tired, in which case we want to communicate with the outside world for a brief period of time, then after one hour or so we want to go back inside ourselves again and be left alone. This is somehow like Melvin thinks. People think that he has nothing to do and they keep knocking at his door and he gets really aggravated about that.  He is my favorite character in this movie, not to diminish the other ones. He is just so full on nuances that make him very entertaining. Helen's role is very, very, good and she did a really good job with it. Greg Kinnear (Sabrina) is Simon Bishop, the artist who is Udall's next door neighbor who finally has Melvin turning into a little more normal human being and he is there to teach him many life lessons.  The supporting actors are great,  you have Oscar winner Cuba Gooding Jr. (Jerry Maguire) playing Frank Sachs, Simon's agent.My favorite scenes elementary school kids all in uniform screaming Wait! Melvin,  wait! Greg Kinnear imitating Melvin. Melvin and Caroll going to eat fresh rolls in the wee hours of the morning. When Melvin realizes that the dog is also skipping cracks on the sidewalk.My favorite quote I am drowning  here and you are describing the water. This is a nice story telling movie. I recommend it!

First off, I have to admit that I am a SW fan but I will try to present an unbiased opinion. I saw the first movie when I was nine so, basically, I grew up with Star Wars. I had to approach this movie with an open mind as I knew getting caught up in the hype would only result in a movie that could not possibly live up to the expectations that I would have had.The biggest feature of this movie is the special effects. There is no doubt that George Lucas is known first and foremost as a special effects wizard and he does not disappoint in this movie. In fact, some of the effects were so well done that I did not even notice them right away. GL's creation of a whole other world\/universe was an incredible success and definitely created the illusion of reality.The biggest drawback was Lucas's decision to have the alien creatures speak in english. A far greater effect would have been made if these creatures spoke in their native tongues with the movie subtitled. This was done in the first set of movies and definitely created the effect of realism. By having the alien creatures speak in english, it tended to take away from the SW feel. In some cases, some of the creatures accents sounded a little bit ethnic or to the opposite extreme, a bit too 'American' (one of the announcers in the pod race scene).This movie catered to both the young and the old and in Lucas's situation, it is a difficult decision to make as leaning too much in either direction would alienate audience groups. The inclusion of Jar Jar created a comic relief that was slightly different from the Ewoks but nonetheless effective. I think that if he had chosen a slightly more grown up voice and personality (while maintaining Jar Jar's innocence) not that many viewers would have found him as annoying. In fact, it probably would have allowed the audience to understand Jar Jar's race and his personal plight. The voice suggestion could have been applied to many of the creatures that GL created. It's amazing what a voice can do to the believability of a character.Neeson did an admirable job of Qui-Gon but it could have been better. He did make his character a believable Jedi Master though. McGregor did about as well as he could considering he was basically a secondary character with very few and short lines. I am sure this will change in the next two movies as it will definately revolve around his character and character development will be essential. Portman was a little stoic as the queen and as a result it was hard for the audience to feel any sympathy for her role as a ruler of a world under attack. On the flip side, her portrayal of the queen's aid (I know, I know, she was actually the queen when she went with Qui-Gon to Anakin's village) was performed a lot better as she was allowed to play a character with a little more feeling. Quite surprisingly, the character that I found the most believable was Watoo, the junk yard dealer. Maul's involvment was effective but it would have added more to the film if he had a bigger role. He was probably one of the few characters that everyone wanted to know and see more of.Overall, the movie was entertaining but it did lack a bit of the Star Wars feel to it. Rest assured the next movie will be even more entertaining. Too bad we have to wait 3 years for it. 7\/10.

What about the treatment in the mental ward?? Why was he given shock treatments? Because he was screaming on a steeple in the middle of the lake??

The maid, Mary had JUST left and she didn't see anyone planting an apple on the swing?? and IF Vivian was there, why didn't the detective see him before he himself ran into Claire in the woods near her home? How about the husband going to look for the dog in that abandoned hotel? (I agree with the other commentator that this part was absolutely ridiculous) Why would he go all that way to look for his dog, when he didn't care about the dog the night that Claire caused an accident in the road while chasing the dog? And who was the woman who knew who the dog belonged to well enough to have Claire's number and call her husband to come get the dog?Now to Vivian.. First, I am disturbed that the reasons behind him being left to die in the lake weren't explained, why his mother was so abusive and what happened to his father? What about the treatment in the mental ward?? Why was he given shock treatments? Because he was screaming on a steeple in the middle of the lake?? HELLO... he had just managed to break free of a chain tying him to his bed before drowning..wouldn't you be screaming if this happened to you? And what about that nursery rhyme? Why was he writing that in his room? where had he heard it? What meaning did it have for him?How about in the hospital when Claire begins tearing up the wallpaper in her room.. do you mean that when the staff comes to get her to talk to the doctor they do not notice the writing on the chalkboard behind the wallpaper enough to let the Doc in on it before he goes to her room to discover it later?I also didn't really like Robert Downey JR's portrayal of the killer. He was too pouty, too sing songy but not where it was spooky or crazy sounding..he just sounded like a spoiled child. Kevin Spacey would have played this part better..had they explained the psychosis a little more.Oh yes and you mean to tell me that for all of his 14 or so years (the age he seemed to be when he escaped from the mental ward) he had never once killed someone in the hospital so that he would have been isolated? I mean, it was so easy for him to kill that nurse..he did it without thought.I love the kind of movies that leave you having to decide for yourself what really happened etc, but not in this manner.. I mean, why not rather just give us a base plot, turn the camera off and leave us to make up the whole movie ourselves?This movie reminded me of Meet Joe Black in the way that someone had a GREAT idea of a story but failed to follow it all the way through.. I think they need to do this before making the final film.. again, it left me hungry.. like going to a dinner party where they give you an appetizer and tastes of the courses but never the full meal..leaving you wanting more..

I have heard critics say that it had a Phantom plot, but I could NOT disagree more.  The film has it's own very good plot, while at the same time showing a lot of other plots that will be developed in II and III, and were already brought up in IV, V, and VI.Another critique I read was that the character Jar-Jar Binks was one of the most obnoxious film creations ever, but I heartily disagree.  Jar-Jar was obviously aimed more at kids, but this movie is intended for kids as much as anyone else.  Besides, Jar-Jar is fairly humorous, even if he does cross the line into being slightly annoying from time to time. Another excellent thing about this film is that it has it's own very good self contained plot, while at the same time alluding to episodes IV-VI, showing how certain things came to be in these episodes.  The film also does a good job of aluding to things to come in episodes II and III, things we don't know for sure but have our theories about. My only real complaint about this film is that Darth Maul should have been developed more--he was a frightening villain, and his appearance alone causes reaction in any crowd.  But I think he could have been even more terrifying had he been developed more. On the whole though, I highly recommend this movie.  It was very fun, and quite enjoyable.  Although I know no film could EVER live up to the hype this one had surrounding it, don't go in expecting the greatest film ever. Go in willing to suspend disbelief and just be entertained by a great story and some great effects.  If you do that, you should certainly be swept up in the film just like I was.

One thing struck me, the flat and one dimensional shape of the chars. Personally I think, Mr. Lucas was 'seduced' by the power the computer offered him, and where he used story-telling and gripping characters in Episodes IV-VI, it all suffered a bit and was overpowered by SFX.

I suppose, this was Mr. Lucas strategy all along; to attract some of the younger viewers the see the movie, along with their parents (who saw Luke battle Darth, first hand), perhaps. So, Episode I is a bit of an animated appetizer, showing us in one way what to expect from the SFX department of ILM and letting us wondering how this 'messiah' is being turned into the 'antichrist'.

If a man's home is his castle, then another cliché would also apply here - ignorance is bliss.  There is the mother, Sal,(Anne Tenney) who throws herself at making strange arts and crafts (fringes on ceiling lamps and oddly shaped pottery mugs) and at cooking nutritious meals just so Dad can joyfully ask, 'what's that?', and she can respond positively, 'it's meatloaf'.

I went into the theatre thinking to myself; If this movie beat 'Saving Private Ryan' then it must be incredible!!. As I watch the movie, I am greeted by some of the best acting I have seen in a movie. A brilliant cast with Judi Dench and Geoffrey Rush as standouts. They really stole the show! (A little more time with them would have been nice.) I liked Gwyneth Paltrow, partly because I am a 16 year-old male, and partly because I have seen her in other movies and I have been a slight fan. The screenplay was incredible! You were really made to think that Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet that way! Directing was great. Not a Spielberg by any means, but still good. The sets, the costumes, the sound everything was there! I had a great time watching it...yet I couldn't help but think afterwards that I had been hoodwinked.I was racking my brains trying to think about the little problem, that minor issue that annoyed me about this movie. I kept thinking to myself; What am I on about? It was a great movie, brilliant in all respects. What on Earth is it???. Then it hit me, and I don't think anybody has picked this up about it. The pace.The movie was almost like a Shakespeare play in itself and Shakespeare plays are meant to be taken at a slow pace so that you can understand what is going on. I felt as if after I watched it I still hadn't seen it. It stopped right at the point it should have started. I suppose I might have to see it another time to satisfy my wants, but I don't think it deserved to win Best Picture at the Oscars over 'Saving Private Ryan'.

Jar Jar Binks should be completely cut out of the movie.  He's a stupid and annoying character.  (For those of you who don't know, he's the fully CG character that follow Qui Jon and Obi-wan around.)2.

(Once again, see the movie.)Now parts that I REALLY enjoyed.1. Darth Maul.  All I can say, without giving anything away, is that he's bar none THE coolest character in Star Wars.  Even though he has like 5 lines, his presence, and sword technique are just WAY TOO COOL. Trust me, you'll be blown away by the fights that he has, especially with the 2 jedi at once.  DAMN cool!2. Senator Palpatine\/Darth Sideous.  He was great as well!  He did a good job conveying a certain duality, while remaining manipulative, good job!3. R2D2 All I can say is that droid rocked out!  I really liked him in the movie.  I've always wanted an astromech droid, and I now want one even more.  C3P0 was cool too, just because you could see these cool spinney things in his head!  *grin*4. The cameos.  All I'll say about this is look for some cool things on Tatoine.  Especially in the pod race, sitting on the mountains, watching the race. ;)I'm going to go and try to see this movie again this coming weekend when I go home.

I thanked him for his warning in a sort of off-hand way, expecting him to smile, but he took my arm and with the most serious face said, I know how much you like Star Wars, Tom, but you really need to be ready for this because I wasn't and it's still bugging me. I wondered what could be so bad about this Jar Jar guy, but nothing could have totally prepared me for him.Jar Jar appears early in the film.  The character is completely CGI, which is fine (though he seems rather cartoonish), and he speaks with a shrill, cartoonish voice in an unintelligible accent.  Unfortunately, about half of what he says is incomprehensible and the most commonly heard statement in the theater was What'd he say?.  It's probably better that you can't decode much of what he says, because what is understandable from Jar Jar is stupid, pointless and most of all annoying.Jar Jar's function appears to be that of comic relief, except nothing he says or does is remotely funny or even mildly amusing.  When Jar Jar does do or say something funny, the moment is milked way too long and the scene quickly becomes awkward (thus very unfunny). Though, presumably, Jar Jar's antics are meant to lighten the mood or cater to children, not once in the packed theater did I hear anyone laugh at him and I don't see how Jar Jar could appeal to anyone over the age of six. Jar Jar seems more like a technology showcase, as in Look here, a completely CGI character, everyone! and you get the sense that his scenes, full of pointless garble, exist only to justify his presence as a character in the film.The bottom line is that the Jar Jar character is a terrible distraction. He's there throughout the film -- we never really get a decent rest from him -- and it's impossible to tune him out because of his shrill voice, which is also louder than everyone else's voice in the film.  In a film that just barely succeeds plot-wise beyond the two-dimensional (which is fine, since Episode 1 is both a starting point and introduction to the saga), Jar Jar is a terrible mistake that only brings the film down.I don't know what Lucas was thinking, both in the creation of and casting for this character, but whatever it was it didn't work.  I have a feeling that during production someone must have realized that a serious blunder had been made -- I doubt, however, that this information was relayed to Lucas. The reason I'm harping on this is simply because Jar Jar almost ruined a film I've waited 22 years to see, and if you're like me you'll appreciate the warning.I say almost ruined because the visual effects, sound and music for TPM are amazing.  Young Anakin is a believable character, and the pod race sequence alone is worth the price of admission.  Darth Maul is a really cool bad guy -- it's just too bad he's not used much until the film's end.  The lightsaber duels are beyond your wildest dreams, but the plot is simplistic and somewhat copied out of elements from eps 4, 5 and 6.  The space battle is a little too much like ep 4, and it relies on silly flukishness to achieve final victory (which evokes memories of the stupid Ewok battle from Return of the Jedi).That said, if you're a Star Wars obsessive like me you'll enjoy the film so long as you really, really prepare yourself for this Jar Jar guy.

There is one and only one reason to see this movie and (correct) it's the special effects. They are amazing. They are beyond anything ever seen before. They are nearly flawless (from a technical point of view) and perfectly integrated. Everything else in this movie was pretty much forgettable and some things really hurt (me at least). Among all things, this movie starts with a taxation dispute. Gone are the days of swashbuckling heroes with a loose tongue and a good sense of humor. Everything is business now, even the storyline. For the loose tongue we get wooden dialoge (which at certain points is just really, really bad and completely unbelievable) and the humor is now provided by fully animated fart jokes and one of the most annoying sidekicks I have ever seen. The force is now the effect of some microbes and can be measured by means of a blood sample and Darth Vader is virgin-born messiah who speaks to his mom as if reciting from ancient scriptures (altough I believe this point may be altered in the coming episodes). In this galaxy, I would not be too surprised to find the planet Zeist somewhere. But all of this would be unimportant if the story would run smoothly. Unfortunately it does not. The movie takes no time to introduce us into its universe, we get thrown right into it. The plot is contrived and most scenes feel packed with necessary references for the sequels and expository dialoge. Those which are not are technically excellent, but really superfluous from a story point of view. The light saber 'duels' for example are top notch action and far better than anything seen in the original trilogy, but Darth Maul is just your typical pop-up-enemy with no background and totally lacks the evil aura of the original Darth Vader.

The only scary thing is our knowledge of his eventual fate. There is a lot that I would still like to comment, but let me just mention the scene cuts.
