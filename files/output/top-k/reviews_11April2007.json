[{"date":"11 April 2007","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Well Im 23, male and have never seen, or even wanted to see a movie staring a pop star. Always found myself changing the radio whenever Mandy Moore, Britney etc began to sing. It was late one night, 2 am and I was just finishing up my studying and about to go to bed when this movie came on super station, so I decided it would be a good choice to fall asleep too, why not? It started off with all the ingredients for another hackneyed teenie movie but as the plot progressed it became so much more than that. Lo and behold I found myself staying up until the wee hours of the morning just to see what happened next.The entire time I found myself becoming more and more intrigued with Jamie. This is the kind of girl you want to marry. Anyways Im not gonna go over the plot as there's hundreds of posts that have already done that, but do not mistake this for a regular teen movie. There's no comedy, sex, and plot which revolves around and culminates in the prom dance. I usually don't like love stories either, movies I watch include Scarface, Boondock Saints, 7 Samurai, Good bad + Ugly, Yojimbo... well you get the point.Anyways Im going out today to buy the movie so I can watch it again and see the scenes that super station always cuts out. I feel almost embarrassed doing it and actually posting about this but this is the kind of movie that leaves you with a lot to think about afterwords.
