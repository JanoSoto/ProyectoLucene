The laughs are gut- bursting, and the hot Nevada desert is the perfect resort to capture just how zany and outrageous the Griswalds can be. Sure it's good to watch one in a blue moon, after seeing the same gags over and over again, it does loses its flavour like a piece of chewing gum and you can easily become bored after a while. The film is truly a follow-up to Christmas Vacation as Clark finally got his big bonus from his marketing business after his newly invented cereal bars are a success and decides to use his money to his advantage and brings his wife and kids with him where they'll go on a frenzy gambling and living the life on Easy Street. During their stay, the Griswalds venture on their own to see what fortune comes their way. Such scenes involves legendary crooner Wayne Newton trying to get it on with Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo). Clark and the kids have their moments as well. Sure the Griswald family follow the same path as the other three installments, but that's because of their inept ways of life, they have managed to make us laugh. We all come to see them struggle, fail and try to move up only to still remain left behind, but we love them for that and that is what keeps their fans from coming into theatres for. We were all shocked to see Clark as he dangles off Hoover Dam and crashing through Wayne Newton's house with the van.The movie is very rich because the film is unpredictable. You think that they slowed the tempo down in Christmas Vacation, but think again, the falls, the slapstick humour is still effective as we await for every gag to takes its shape and every way for the Griswalds to bend it. The laughs continue and never gets bored the first time seeing it at least, but after multiple viewing it loses its flavour like chewing gum. Clark and the gang had their moments of laugh-till-your-stomach- bursts moments, however, the funniest scenes will involve the funniest supporting player to the Griswold clan. I'm talking about Randy Quaid's Cousin Eddie. From the first and third installments (he wasn't in European Vacation), he was always a dynamic character and the reason why is that even though he's dumber than rocks, his heart is in the right place and looks out for Clark even in the the most dire situations. But his redneck ways and caring charm puts a light touch to someone's heart. This film isn't without its weaknesses. For one thing if you seen the other three Griswald adventures you seen them all. The madcap over- the-top slapstick humour has been done many times before and many times better. Even the dialogue and the facial expressions have all been executed in the very same pattern. But hey, what do I expect this film was going to be, a life-changing drama? Hell, no this is National Lampoon baby, so the film should be about overdosing in slapstick comedy so why spoil a good thing.Another fault is why was Wayne Newton playing a pivotal part in the film. Sure he's a respective singer and I would have been okay if he played a cameo role in the film. But as a supporting character, he was just plain awful. He was just playing himself, a sleazy Vegas singer who had the hots for Ellen.Usually in the other three films I laughed with the family, but in Vegas Vacation, I couldn't help but feel sorry for them, especially from the kids (who looked too old to play the parts of Audrey and Rusty). The lack of chemistry is missing in this film because the kids and the parents seem to go their own separate ways. I thought it angered me that Clark kept forgetting his daughter's name most of the time (making her feel like the black sheep of the family a la Meg Griffin from Family Guy). I also felt that there was a lot of parental negligence as the kids Audrey and Rusty found themselves in dangerous predicaments. It was also very angering that Clark spent over $23,000 of his bonus money on gambling when he should have done as he promised in Christmas Vacation was to install a swimming pool. It made me think where's social services when you need them feeling I got. Surely a family could not have been this dysfunctional. But though it all it still succeeds in providing you with non-stop gags and having you laughing the whole way through. Overall this movie is by far a terrible movie. The laughs are plentiful and you'll surely have a good time and Randy Quaid was wonderful as Cousin Eddie. I would recommend it as a comedy and really nothing more than that.

One of the reasons being that any other title would not be as good as this one. The writers name is Guillaume Laurant, for me is the first time i have heard of him and i really doubt that i have seen any other movies written by him. Now as a first impression of him i really enjoyed the way he set up everything because it wasn't like traditional in a sense so it was really enjoyable. I think for the most part the movie was believable except in some scenes where she would like booby trap the whole apartment or maybe when she called the payphone and just the right guy would answer the phone, but for the most part it is very believable. Speaking of the plot it was very intriguing if you will. It wasn't too complicated but not too simple it was just right.Now starting with another topic the Actors. In the movie Amelie we see an excellent choice of actors. Why is this? well it is simple just with Amelie (the main character) you can see that she is basically the perfect actress for this. She just has so many facial expressions which enable us to see what she is trying to portray. Also the supporting actors are also so well chosen that they fit with Amelie so well that they work as a clock. everyone in sync with each-other and also this creates like the perfect mood. Now with this crew working so well together it enables them to to the movie scenes of humor or the serious parts very easily because they can switch roles just like that. The characters were introduced to us in a very interesting way this being because the director decided to introduce every one in like the first few minutes of the movie. We know who they are what they do etc. so this creates like a basis where the movie starts developing from. Some of the emotions of the emotions i think were really well. But as always i believe they over did it in some scenes. In my opinion i think they really over did it when Amelie is watching the TV imagining it is her. That part was just like too over done. I mean the movie is really good at portraying emotions but in this scene for me it was just a little over done but overall the feelings that it shows through out the rest of the movie are really well shown. Also a thing that caught my attention was like how well the actors adapted to the script. They just seemed so fluid and so constant that it was really amazing. They all were really good at knowing their roles and how to show their roles. The photographic view of the film i think that the director chose the camera angles very well, He did great use of the long shot were we could see like the whole city or the whole train station to give us an extraordinary perspective other than just showing us the main character walking around doing the same thing. it creates almost like a different feeling because we can get to like experience like we are there. He also was brilliant at the part of doing close ups. He would normally do them when something intense was happening, or where he really wanted to how some type of emotion. like when Amelie was talking to the guy she first gave his toy box. I personally think this counts as a close up because we can see very well how she is feeling due to her facial expressions we see that she is like very uncomfortable and kind of wanting to leave that place earlier.Talking about the setting the setting i think created a different feeling that it would have created if it was done in for example new york or something. It really creates different feelings and i think for this type of movie Paris was an astounding place to film this complex yet simple movie. Something i noticed was that in many scenes it was like very full like there was too much going on. like in the haunted house, we have a clear vision of her directly but people tend to get distracted very easily and could not put attention to the main plot of the story due to that. This only happened in a couple of scenes and i personally got distracted but many people might not have the same problem. Another thing i was really intrigued by was that some scenes weren't exactly made to be understood right at the second. like for example when she is following the guy with the red book we don't understand why until it shows us later on. This was a very clever idea on behalf of the directors because it keeps you like with the desire to know more of what is happening. Now finally the directing. I believe the directing of this movie was great. The Director Jean- Pierre Jeunet was able to balance the scenes perfectly. He knew how to add the perfect balance of humor, anger, and all of those. by doing this i believe that all the actors were well informed and well balanced in their acting because they always knew what to do and what not to. I think that the scenes were mostly very very well edited. Overall i think this movie was really good despite the fact that i'm not much into these types of movies. it really maintained me entertained and the plot and all the story were really interesting so i do recommend this movie.

Robert De Niro gave a perfect subtle performance as Vito Corleone. His portrayal was powerful and breathtaking. When I think De Niro I definitely do not think subtle and smooth but that is exactly what he was in here. It is definitely one of his top three performances in his career. The depth in his portrayal was able to justify the Vito Corleone that Marlon Brando portrayed in the first. Al Pacino gave a very strong performance playing Michael Corleone. In here we get to see more of the tough decisions that have to be made and the consequences of certain actions. Al Pacino perfectly displayed the amount of thought and struggle that goes into and comes out of every action you make; the way it affects relationships, family, power and influence. Diane Keaton was not really given a lot of room to act in the first but in here she is very good. She did not play the stereotypical wife who always stands behind her husband but rather the woman with a mind of her own who is willing to go after what she feels she deserves. Robert Duvall again to me was the glue to the movie. Just having him in there kind of makes you feel safe. John Cazale also had more of an impact in here than in the first playing the half-witted brother always needing to be bailed out. A lot of these characters sound so familiar and stereotypical but in The Godfather Part II every character is played out with such extraordinary depth. Everyone from Talia Shire who gave a fine performance to Lee Strasberg all the way down to the kid who played young Vito Corleone were perfect. Part II seems to me to be more of a character study than the original.

In here we get to see more of the tough decisions that have to be made and the consequences of certain actions. Al Pacino perfectly displayed the amount of thought and struggle that goes into and comes out of every action you make; the way it affects relationships, family, power and influence. Diane Keaton was not really given a lot of room to act in the first but in here she is very good. She did not play the stereotypical wife who always stands behind her husband but rather the woman with a mind of her own who is willing to go after what she feels she deserves. Robert Duvall again to me was the glue to the movie. Just having him in there kind of makes you feel safe. John Cazale also had more of an impact in here than in the first playing the half-witted brother always needing to be bailed out. A lot of these characters sound so familiar and stereotypical but in The Godfather Part II every character is played out with such extraordinary depth. Everyone from Talia Shire who gave a fine performance to Lee Strasberg all the way down to the kid who played young Vito Corleone were perfect. Part II seems to me to be more of a character study than the original.

I watch this film almost every Christmas, and let's face it -- Bing is the focus of the film -- and he really was never better. For one thing, watch his face carefully during some of the musical numbers...he's visibly having fun. I'd have to say that at least in terms of film, he was at his absolute peak here, doing rather nicely in the dance numbers, and of course in the singing department.But aside from that, this is one of the best musicals...and it didn't come out of MGM. Paramount did this one up big! The Technicolor and Vista Vision (the first of the latter) are stunning.Despite having a fairly large cast, there are really only 6 main character. Bing and Danny Kaye play a song and dance team that headlined after the end of WWII, but it's especially interesting to see how nicely and sentimentally the battleground scene was filmed. Danny feels Bing is lonely, and is intent to match him up with a woman. Along comes the sister-singers -- Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen (although in reality, Vera-Ellen's numbers are dubbed, in part by Clooney herself!) As with many romantic comedies there are a number of misunderstandings, taking the story from Florida to the winter wonderland of Vermont...where there's now snow. Where they bump into the boy's old General -- Dean Jagger -- now a floundering lodge owner. And his nemesis is housekeeper Mary Wickes.Bing was wonderful in movies, and especially so here. I seriously dislike Danny Kaye as a performer, but I do admire this performance, including his wonderful dance number with Vera-Ellen (The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing). Rosemary Clooney was delightful in her somewhat spiteful character, but it all ends in romance, with a few spats in between. Her specialty number Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me is terrific. Jagger is at his most ingratiating here, and it was in this general time period that he did some of his best supporting-actor work. Vera-Ellen's dancing is stupendous, and it's easy to see why some consider her the finest of the female dancers.And then, of course, there are the Irving Berlin songs White Christmas (which opens and closes the film), The Old Man (a sentimentally wonderful tribute to the general by Crosby and Kaye), Sisters (by Clooney & Vera-Ellen, and then hilariously reprised by Bing and Danny), The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing (which includes a wonderful dance routine by Kaye and Vera-Ellen), the imaginative Snow (with Crosby, Kaye, Clooney & Vera-Ellen), I'd Rather See a Minstrel Show\/Mister Bones\/Mandy (Crosby, Kaye, Clooney,& Chorus; although it shows off Vera-Ellen's legs in a way that betray her anorexia); the timeless Count Your Blessings (by Crosby & Clooney; just why did Eddie Fisher's recorded version become the hit?), Choreography (by Kaye, and the one number in the film I despise and fast forward through each year), the sentimental What Can You Do with a General? (Crosby), and the nifty Gee, I Wish I Was Back in the Army (Crosby, Kaye, Clooney & Stevens). I'm not sure there has ever been a better cluster of Irving Berlin songs in any one movie (although, admittedly, some are recycled, including the title song).All in all, a smash film that was the top-moneymaker of 1954, and still wears extremely well.

A herald reads to crowds that King Richard I, the Lion Heart (Coeur de Lion), as he was returning to the West from the Third Crusade, has been captured (1191 in the movie, but actually 1192) by his sworn enemy, Leopold of Austria. He is being held captive for an incredibly large ransom (150,000 marks, or 100,000 English pounds). Taking advantage of the situation, Richard's brother Prince John (Claude Rains) deposes the legal regent (Longchamps) and seizes control of the Kingdom of England. John's chief henchmen are Sir Guy of Gisbourne (Basil Rathbone) and the Sheriff of Nottingham (Melville Cooper). John promptly raises taxes, ostensibly to raise Richard's huge ransom, but in reality to build up the resources to maintain his power structure.When the English (Anglo-Saxons) protest the exorbitant taxes, they are oppressed, beaten, and tortured, and lose their properties. Taking pity on the oppressed Saxons, Sir Robin of Locksley (Errol Flynn) and sidekick Will Scarlett (Patric Knowles) begin to protect them. Eventually known as Robin Hood, he and his Merry Men inhabit Sherwood Forest and become wanted outlaws. King John confiscates Robin's properties. The revolt becomes full-fledged as new men are recruited, like John Little (or Little John, Alan Hale) and Friar Tuck (Eugene Palette). In the meantime, Norman Maid Marian Fitzwalter (Olivia de Havilland) is firmly in John's court and corner in the beginning. But after Sir Guy's treasure guard is defeated, captured, and temporarily held by Robin's forces, she realizes that Robin is caring and is most sincere about real justice for the common people. She eventually falls in love with him. After being foiled many times by Robin, King John, advised by the Sheriff, sets a trap at a national archery contest. He captures the outlaw. At a tavern, Lady Marian tells Robin's men where he is held, and thus just before his scheduled execution he is dramatically freed. Meanwhile King Richard (Ian Hunter) has been released by the Austrians. (It is assumed that the ransom was paid by Robin's men.) The rightful king and his entourage travel incognito in England, gathering information relating to local events. Richard soon meets up with Robin's Merry Men, who, upon recognizing the king, kneel in homage and express their loyalty to the true crown. They are determined to unseat the usurper. Meanwhile Marian is arrested and condemned to death for treason by John and Sir Guy. John, falsely believing that Richard is dead by a (failed) assassination attempt, plans a full-fledged coronation ceremony at his castle. The denouement involves the attack by Robin's forces at John's coronation when the disguised attackers appear and surprise John's knights. There is a spectacular sword-fight between Robin and Sir Guy and Robin that ends the action. Richard is restored to his rightful throne, as John and the Sheriff are banished. Robin becomes Lord, Baron, and Earl, and Lady Marian and he have Richard's permission to marry. Errol Flynn as the dashing Robin Hood (Sir Robin of Locksley) is in his best role. He owns the part. His love interest is perfectly matched with lovely and petite 22-year old Olivia De Havilland (Lady Marian). Basil Rathbone, a superb swordsman in real life, is excellent as the haughty Sir Guy of Gisbourne. So is Claude Rains as the evil Prince John who persecutes the Saxons. The other castings are equally first-rate. In short, there are superior photography by Gaudio and Polito (in California, not England!), excellent Korngold music, colorful Anderson costumes, good direction, nice script by Raine and Miller, and great sword-fights! What an adventure, one of the best of the Middle Ages ever filmed! The American Film Institute twice issued its listings of the top 100 movies of all time. Both times The Adventures of Robin Hood did not make the list. But AFI's listings did include movies like The Apartment (1960), Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?(1967), Network (1976), Tootsie (1982), and Do the Right Thing (1989). I assure you that The Adventures of Robin Hood was superior to those in virtually every method examined. Watch and compare. But one may ask, Does this movie portray the real medieval England? Probably not, and there are historical inaccuracies. But watch it anyway (more than once), as it ranks as one of the all-time great adventure flicks in world cinema!BONUS INFORMATION As written by the Venerable Bede, the Angles and Saxons (and Jutes) from northern Europe invaded Britannia (England) in the fifth century and displaced the Romano-Briton population. The Jutes were soon absorbed by the Saxons. Over time the Angles and Saxons (English) became more civilized, and in the seventh century England was reconverted to the old Christian faith of Roman times. In the ninth century, King Alfred (d. 899) united much of Anglo-Saxon England and fought invading Danes, establishing Europe's first national State in the process. In 1066, the Normans successfully invaded the nation (Battle of Hastings) and consolidated their power. In 1189, Richard I inherited his kingdom from his Norman father, Henry II. Upon his return from the Crusades and Austrian captivity, Richard forgave his brother John and again made him his heir (1194). But Richard spent little time in England. In March 1199, as he was besieging a castle in France without wearing his chain mail, he was struck by a crossbow arrow in his left shoulder and eventually died of gangrene poisoning in the arms of his mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine. John became king, but had his problems with rebellious barons. So it was that they forced him to acknowledge political reform, the Magna Carta (Great Charter), at Runnymede near Windsor Castle (1215). John died of disease a year later while campaigning against the rebels in the First Barons' War.

A herald reads to crowds that King Richard I, the Lion Heart (Coeur de Lion), as he was returning to the West from the Third Crusade, has been captured (1191 in the movie, but actually 1192) by his sworn enemy, Leopold of Austria. He is being held captive for an incredibly large ransom (150,000 marks, or 100,000 English pounds). Taking advantage of the situation, Richard's brother Prince John (Claude Rains) deposes the legal regent (Longchamps) and seizes control of the Kingdom of England. John's chief henchmen are Sir Guy of Gisbourne (Basil Rathbone) and the Sheriff of Nottingham (Melville Cooper). John promptly raises taxes, ostensibly to raise Richard's huge ransom, but in reality to build up the resources to maintain his power structure.When the English (Anglo-Saxons) protest the exorbitant taxes, they are oppressed, beaten, and tortured, and lose their properties. Taking pity on the oppressed Saxons, Sir Robin of Locksley (Errol Flynn) and sidekick Will Scarlett (Patric Knowles) begin to protect them. Eventually known as Robin Hood, he and his Merry Men inhabit Sherwood Forest and become wanted outlaws. King John confiscates Robin's properties. The revolt becomes full-fledged as new men are recruited, like John Little (or Little John, Alan Hale) and Friar Tuck (Eugene Palette). In the meantime, Norman Maid Marian Fitzwalter (Olivia de Havilland) is firmly in John's court and corner in the beginning. But after Sir Guy's treasure guard is defeated, captured, and temporarily held by Robin's forces, she realizes that Robin is caring and is most sincere about real justice for the common people. She eventually falls in love with him. After being foiled many times by Robin, King John, advised by the Sheriff, sets a trap at a national archery contest. He captures the outlaw. At a tavern, Lady Marian tells Robin's men where he is held, and thus just before his scheduled execution he is dramatically freed. Meanwhile King Richard (Ian Hunter) has been released by the Austrians. (It is assumed that the ransom was paid by Robin's men.) The rightful king and his entourage travel incognito in England, gathering information relating to local events. Richard soon meets up with Robin's Merry Men, who, upon recognizing the king, kneel in homage and express their loyalty to the true crown. They are determined to unseat the usurper. Meanwhile Marian is arrested and condemned to death for treason by John and Sir Guy. John, falsely believing that Richard is dead by a (failed) assassination attempt, plans a full-fledged coronation ceremony at his castle. The denouement involves the attack by Robin's forces at John's coronation when the disguised attackers appear and surprise John's knights. There is a spectacular sword-fight between Robin and Sir Guy and Robin that ends the action. Richard is restored to his rightful throne, as John and the Sheriff are banished. Robin becomes Lord, Baron, and Earl, and Lady Marian and he have Richard's permission to marry. Errol Flynn as the dashing Robin Hood (Sir Robin of Locksley) is in his best role. He owns the part. His love interest is perfectly matched with lovely and petite 22-year old Olivia De Havilland (Lady Marian). Basil Rathbone, a superb swordsman in real life, is excellent as the haughty Sir Guy of Gisbourne. So is Claude Rains as the evil Prince John who persecutes the Saxons. The other castings are equally first-rate. In short, there are superior photography by Gaudio and Polito (in California, not England!), excellent Korngold music, colorful Anderson costumes, good direction, nice script by Raine and Miller, and great sword-fights! What an adventure, one of the best of the Middle Ages ever filmed! The American Film Institute twice issued its listings of the top 100 movies of all time. Both times The Adventures of Robin Hood did not make the list. But AFI's listings did include movies like The Apartment (1960), Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?(1967), Network (1976), Tootsie (1982), and Do the Right Thing (1989). I assure you that The Adventures of Robin Hood was superior to those in virtually every method examined. Watch and compare. But one may ask, Does this movie portray the real medieval England? Probably not, and there are historical inaccuracies. But watch it anyway (more than once), as it ranks as one of the all-time great adventure flicks in world cinema!BONUS INFORMATION As written by the Venerable Bede, the Angles and Saxons (and Jutes) from northern Europe invaded Britannia (England) in the fifth century and displaced the Romano-Briton population. The Jutes were soon absorbed by the Saxons.
