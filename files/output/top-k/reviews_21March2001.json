I had been thoroughly impressed by the trailer which usually indicates a film lacking but from the first frame I was drawn in and captivated by Jean-Jacques Annaud's stark grays and cold wintry setting.But the film instantly bursts alive when Jude Law enters the screen in a scene reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan.  Now granted, I think it does a disservice to compare this film to 'Ryan.  Except for a muted-gray palette and the opening assault the films are quite different.  It is the smaller story within the chaos that truly makes this film worthy.A love story between Law and an arresting dark beauty named Rachel Weisz gives the film a heartbeat.  And the jealously of a political officer played by the excellent Joseph Fiennes whose spin has propelled naive farmboy Law to fame allows the viewer access to the characters.  It is the media-savvy Fiennes who turns the boy into a serialized hero, almost out of the dime store novels of the old west.But for me it is the incomparable Ed Harris that seals the deal.  I'll bet that his character, all together, didn't even have ten pages of dialogue but it's the eyes that hold you.  Those steel blue eyes fit perfectly into the cold and patient world of the sniper, marked with violence that is immediate and raw.  The perfectly cut uniform, the stern features and the dignity with which he always carries himself puts this man in an elite category.This is a true actor's movie, accented by a set of flawless performances that in itself is worth the price of admission.  Forget about the fact that you wind up rooting for Communists.  Forget the politics which were wisely paired down.  It is the chess game between the old man and the new blood. No wasted moments.  No posing and overstuffed one-liners.  Just quiet craftsmanship that does the talent of the actors justice.This is one that is worth a look.

On one level, it is a very funny film. Some of the writing is fabulous. On the other level, as a meaningful and philosophical film, it fails by a large margin.When I first saw Fight Club it was on the DVD special edition. I had avoided hearing anything about the film, and thus the inherent spoilers about the narrator's true nature were still there for me to be surprised about. When I first learned that him and Tyler were supposed to be the same person, I was thrown for a loop. I figured that there was no way the movie could pull such a cheap trick on me.When the movie ended, I was left with a very empty feeling. What I had just seen was at once supurbly edited and very humerous, but I felt that there was another side to it. On the second viewing I finally realized that it was nothing more than an amatuerish effort to use buzzwords to evoke responses from people. I watched the film a second time and paid closer attention to the movie's main message. I even tried to imagine what it would be like to follow the film's message, and so I thus placed my mind into a realm so I could just absorb and obey what the film was trying to say.After the second viewing, I realized that at most the film was trying to juxtapose two different films into one. The first sequence, before the establishment of Fight Club (some of the following scenes not directly involving Fight Club or Project Mayhem were also top-notch), was amazingly well-written. The characters interacted very well with each other. Once Fight Club began, the movie took a turn for the worse.The sequences of Fight Club and Project Mayhem were nothing more than an amateurish attempt to create a physical representation of a philosophy that in general makes sense. It tried to say (basically) that once you lost everything, your life began to have true meaning. Your life is not the sum of your possessions or something like that.While this message is powerful and inherently a buzzword, the representation of this philosophy in Fight Club boiled down to chaos. While this was on one level a workmanlike way of handling it, I would have much preferred to see the movie evolve along the lines of discussional based philosophy (perhaps the planning of some of Project Mayhem and a nice bit of why it is ocurring would have been acceptable).I think that Fight Club had the chance to be a very good film. It did not handle itself properly (although this would never have been fixed since it was based on a book). Some sequences were very good and very meaningful, but the handling of the philosophies in a tangible manner came off as very amateur and base. I just wish that maybe the filmmakers would have explored some of the issues in a musing style rather than in a physical representation.

It's action, baby! The supporting characters were good, with a big nod given to Anthony Anderson for his comedic backup.  He was good in Romeo Must Die, but significantly better here.One of the best points about the film was Seagal's willingness to get kicked around for a change.  Usually, he's the opposite of Jackie Chan, escaping battles with multiple opponents totally unscathed.  This time, his character faced adversaries who landed repeatedly on him, and lasted more than one exchange before succumbing to this throw or that joint lock.  Actually having DMX's character hold his own a little against Boyd was, I thought, a very interesting choice, and one I don't disapprove of.I have only two gripes about this film.  First, Jill Hennessy was grossly misused here.  She could have made an excellent contribution to the movie had her part been more substantial.  Also, Mulcahy's death was a little too similar to that of Hennessy's character in Law and Order, but I suppose that's part of the role rather than anything specific to the actress.  The suddenness of her end was actually a refreshing change from the norm.My other complaint was, as another person mentioned, the shortness of the fight scene involving Michael Jai White.  White did very good scenes with Jean Claude Van Damme in Universal Soldier 2, and could have performed spectacularly with Seagal if given the chance.  Unfortunately, this was the only opportunity we had to see Michael in action, which is a pity.Other than some typical action film implausibilities in the shoot outs, etc., and the use of the wires in some of the scenes, which I find greatly overdone since the Matrix brought it to the mainstream, Exit Wounds was well done.

It's a safe bet that if you answer No, I don't to, say, two or more of the above statements, you may well HATE Dancer in the Dark. It won't be a state of ambivalence, rather a passionate distaste. On the other hand, if the pieces work for you, it's possible to get carried away with your praise of the film. And in all honestly, both opinions are valid. And strangely, I find myself on the fence on most of them.Dancer in the Dark is the not-so-warm-and-fuzzy story of Czech immigrant Selma (Bjork), a factory worker who's saving all of her money so that her son get get a eye operation which would prevent the early blindness that she's experiencing. Selma's only pleasure comes from the musicals she loves. She goes to see early Hollywood musicals with her friend Kathy (Catherine Deneuve) and she's also doing an amateur production of The Sound of Music. As an aside, Bjork may make the freakiest Maria in Sound of Music History The film's tragic complications are put into motion by Selma's landlord, a policeman (David Morse) who may be lying about his wealth.It has been much discussed that Dancer in the Dark's plot is always melodramatic and frequently inane. There's no point in saying anything about its plausability, about how Selma finds herself seemingly testifying against herself in a murder trial, or, well, anything in the film's final act. None of it makes much logical sense, but then again, neither does a magical nanny who flies into town on an unbrella, so we clearly cut musicals some slack.Oh yes, I seem to have left that out of my summary. As Selma becomes increasingly overwhelmed by the real world, she begins to fantasize that she's in a Technicolor musical. You know, the kind of musical where prison guards, jury members, and factory workers know all the words to the same songs and know all of the dance steps?Lars Van Trier is too amused by his own deconstruction of the musical and that's one of my major problems with the film. He seems to think he's being so cute with the various characters discoursing on musical conventions before he goes and tinkers with the same conventions. I'm not sure, though, if he's subverting the genre or embracing it. Or if he just doing a mixture, in which case it just isn't as interesting an idea as he thinks it is.Also, it's hard to tell which part of the genre the film is playing with. When Selma and Kathy go to the movies, they watch old black and white Busby Berkeley kinds of movies. But when Selma goes into her fantasies, she's in a bright technicolor musical which contrasts with the handheld digital video look of her normal life. It's unclear to me how compatible these two visions are.The film's songs, written by Bjork (with lyrics by the director), revolve around the idea of the found rhythm of life. Selma makes music out of the clattering of machines at the factory, the footsteps of prison guards, and the sounds of a train. The organic generation of her songs also plays against the grain of musical tradition, in which the sounds tend to be completely extra-diagetic. Again, I'm not sure how to deal this that.I also just dislike Bjork. That said, she's excellent in the film. Or at least perfect for it. I just didn't really enjoy the songs because I don't enjoy Bjork's music. However, one of the pleasures of watching the film on video is that you can go back and watch the musical numbers a second or third time to try to get into the songs. For the most part, this failed for me, but after two viewings I finally began to enjoy the train song, I've Seen It All. Once again, I accept that people who like Bjork more than I will probably find much more to enjoy.On video the drab real life portions of the film perfectly retain their immediacy. And the performances of all of the leads stand out wonderfully. The musical sections, on the other hand, have been very poorly pan-and-scanned and Lars Van Trier's intended effect seems to be partially lost. Either way it's easy to respect cinematographer Robby Muller's superlative work.So in the end, I just don't know about Dancer in the Darker. It's interesting and original. It's also pretentious to an extreme degree and the melodrama is a bit more than my taste. Van Trier's ability to drive his female stars to the brink of insanity is a skill, but I'm not 100% convinced about its artistic greatness. The mixture of elements is frequently compelling, but never completely pulled me in.So I'm giving this one a 6\/10. That's probably more moderate than most reviews this film will get.

For nowhere will you experience such electrifying, jaw-dropping choreography (Jerome Robbins). Nowhere will you thrill to a more exhilarating, passionate, full-throttled score (Leonard Bernstein, with Stephen Sondheim providing the libretto). And nowhere will you find a more dynamic, better-crafted musical that arguably surpasses its Broadway stage predecessor from overture to finale.Maria, a lovely, innocent Puerto-Rican girl (Juliet) and sister of a formidable gang leader, falls for an opposing though reluctant white-skinned gang member Tony (Romeo) with tragic results.  Set in a tough New York neighborhood where the two disparate groups, the Jets (the Montagues) and Sharks (the Capulets), battle for street territory armed with knives, zip guns and rocks, the determined love affair sets off a calamitous chain of events that, in the end, manage to instill hope in diversity.  Topical enough?The strength of West Side Story is that it does not try to hide its stage roots.  It still unfolds like a musical play.  The film is expanded but the talented cast is not dwarfed by on-location surroundings or panoramic camera work (South Pacific fell victim to this).  On the contrary, the cast lights up every single playing space with sure-footed aliveness and plenty of 'tude.  Co-directors Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins stay true to the original, having the sense not to alter or butcher the score (Man of La Mancha) or haul in a slew of new, untried songs (On the Town, which actually worked for that musical).  In a particularly Wise move (sorry), two numbers were repositioned to enhance or intensify the narrative flow. In the film version, the Officer Krupke number sparked by a goofy Three Stooges-like levity, is moved earlier into the proceedings BEFORE the serious rumbles start, serving neatly as a light and humorous anti-establishment statement.  The tightly-coiled, finger-snapping Cool number is pushed way back, giving both song and situation a heightened impact as it goads and ignites the Jet's feelings of pent-up rage and retaliation AFTER their leader is murdered.

Yes, despite the melodramatic leanings, the necessity of vocal dubbing (by the incomparable Marni Nixon), the flawed Puerto-Rican accent and the general overuse of Coppertone, I still feel for this Maria.  What Wood does offer is utmost sincerity and heartfelt poignancy.  So I'm one person who has gotten off the Natalie Wood-bashing wagon.  Richard Beymer is another matter.  An extremely weak, uncool choice for Tony, his toothy, freshly-scrubbed, chipmunk-like mug and awkward gait reads more like library assistant than gang member.  Who would have thought Beymer would be the one to dazzle us much later in the totally cool and offbeat Twin Peaks? Still, Wood and Beymer commit themselves 100% and manage to create a credible, if not charismatic, love duet that doesn't get in harm's way.Since the film's emphasis is really on dance, it's the flashy second leads who provide the real firepower.

That, my friends, is faith.  I had read about the premise and thought it was brilliant; truly innovative.  Finally, I thought, a movie that might wash the bitter taste of Lost in Space The Motion Picture out of my mouth!  I believed that it might even move me to forget the mistake I made in seeing Hollow Man, though in my defense I was dragged to the theater by two very well-meaning friends.  I must say I was also influenced by the wonderful cast. I mean, there was not one actor in that movie whom I despised, a rarity in my case.  So what, you may be thinking, was my problem?Let me tell you.As far as a wonderful idea goes Being John Malkovich didn't let me down. The film holds an idea born of sheer brilliance, and, let's face it, probably more than a little cannabis.  It is an idea rife with promise and potential.  With it this work could've gone so many wonderful places and could've expanded minds like no movie since Spaceballs has even attempted. The makers of this film could have done all of these things and more with such a fresh idea, such an imaginative idea, but did they?  No.  That is why I am so bitter.  I wasted $16.50.  The makers of this film instead took an idea that was so original, so untouched, so imaginative and turned it into the most trite sex farce I have ever seen.  They turned it into a movie all about sex.  I felt insulted.  Sex is the least thought-provoking theme that a movie could ever have, and it is almost blasphemous when applied to a film with such artistic potential.  I mean, who doesn't think about sex at least once every minute?  Yeah, real unique.  To be honest, the latter part of the movie seemed like a cop out.  It seemed to me that the script writer wasn't sure of what to do with such a gem of an idea.  Here in his usually capable hands was something that no one had done before, so he panicked and ruined it with an almost narcoleptic ignorance of what he was doing.  Like Dorothy, he had no idea what a pair of ruby slippers could do, so he let them go to waste.

The production is a masterpiece of visual style, moving performances, and penetrating dialogue. The story is captivating, even at 157 minutes. There is more than enough unexpected plot twists to keep our attention throughout-and at a consistent pace. Many movies will have moments of inspiration and intrigue, but not The Insider. This movie is one long intriguing moment, a moment that is never boring or lacking. It is also believable and entirely convincing. There is a realistic look into the behavior of journalists and their desire for information. It is so intelligent about revealing the most important information little at a time, always at the perfect second.Russell Crowe's character is the heart of the film, one of the most active protagonists seen in a movie all year. He plays Jeffrey Wigand, an ex-employee at Brown & Williamson, one of the nations largest cigarette manufacturers. Its chairman (Michael Gambon) has fired Wigand for questioning some of their potentially harmful research tactics and business routines-but not before blackmailing him into signing a strict confidentiality agreement that threatens his much needed severance package currently providing for his wife and their two young girls. When the company even further jeopardizes his existence, he blows his fuse and prepares to release information on the indecisive industry of B&W.He gets his opportunity when Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), an ambitious and experienced reporter from the CBS news program 60 Minutes, receives a package regarding product safety studies at another tobacco company. Bergman contacts Wigand, aspiring towards hiring him as a transitory consultant for a potential 60 Minutes show. Bergman senses some vital information withheld in the knowledge of Wigand, therefore further investigates what he is making the executives at B&W so concerned.The film makes many unexpected turns; in the second half, it smartly switches focus from Wigand to Bergman. After losing his privacy, secrets, reputation, and family, Wigand revealing startling facts and starts a new career teaching chemistry. But Bergman faces further complications. His TV Network refuses to air the segment because they could be sued big time for helping break Wigand's confidentiality agreement.You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own f*****g confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets, explains Bergman.The dialogue is one of the brightest, most thought-provoking material in the film. All of the little quirks in typical conversation are captured, the stuttering, the spontaneous explicit declaratives, and the sharp remarks that add a scathing zest to the character's personalities (Agent Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand? Wigand Yes. Yes, I do. I get extremely emotional when *******s put bullets in my mailbox!).The movie's dramatic premise is so clear, so precise, so uncommonly absorbing. It expresses the true stress and nature of the traumatic emotions of the characters. There is also an excellent introduction of both Wigand and Bergman, giving them depth and human dimension. Despite a few members of my cinema discussion group disagree, I extensively enjoyed the piercing middle-eastern soundtrack consisting of awkward beats and fitting tones.Al Pacino is cautious not to steal scenes from co-star Russell Crowe, but when his time comes he lets out a stark and involving performance. Crowe is worthy of his Oscar nomination for best actor; he delivers a performance of great subbtlness, but with an intense underlying tone of innovative depth and power. He captures all of the little tensions and stresses of his character, making his scenes involving, subversive, and taut.Michael Mann is the film's director, who also directed the 1995 thriller Heat starring Val Kilmer, Robert De Niro, and Al Pacino. Here, he pays close attention to details; when a character pushes numbers on a pay phone, the camera captures the feeling-also hitting golf ball against a backdrop, dropping glasses on a table, and notably in an intense scene where two people fax each other important statements and questions. Mann also injects effective camera angles complete with slow motion photography, taking the view of the character, and close up shots.The Insider inhabits a strong social message dealing with the influence of television, reputation, honesty, and so forth. The biggest ethic I think Mann is trying to get across is of modern morality always do the right thing, follow you conscience, no matter what the cost. Then there's the film's most provoking issue Fame has a fifteen-minute half-life. Infamy lasts a little longer.

The sniping duels were repetitious.  How long do you want to watch motionless snipers buried in dirt and newspapers?  The constant darkness of the scenes  turned me off.  The characters (except Harris) weren't particularly engaging or endearing (blame the script).  I kept looking at my watch. ¶ ***SLIGHT SPOILER*** I didn't mind the nighttime public love scene, but it would have been nice if some romantic buildup was given to it.  The shy girl  practically suddenly raped the guy.  She seemed to spend more time panting there than the total time in all their previous exchanges.

It's about the developing friendship between Al (Nick Cage) and Birdy (Matthew Modine), but it's also about a descent into madness, and the lengths to which Al goes for his friend.The film starts in the late 60's, in a US military mental hospital. Cage has been seriously wounded, and has had reconstructive surgery on his face, but he's been brought in because Birdy is here. He's uncommunicative and appears to recognise no one, spending all day squatting on the floor of his cell squinting up at the window.The story is mostly told in flashbacks, either Al recounting incidents in their growing friendship as neighbourhood kids or, later, Birdy remembering other incidents. From the start the two are pretty dissimilar - Al is athletic, outgoing and popular while Birdy is quiet and introverted - a typical nerd. The two are, paradoxically, brought together by Birdy's love of birds, and the stupid things they do - making suits out of pigeon feathers to befriend more pigeons, climbing on (and falling off) factories trying to capture more birds.Al tries to set Birdy on a 'normal' track; they buy a wrecked car and fix it up, and head off to the beach. But Birdy is just too wrapped up in himself for this to work, and it's a wonder he doesn't alienate Al with his strange behaviour.In the 'present', the doctor is putting more pressure on Al to get Birdy to respond; if he doesn't, then Birdy will be written off and sent to a permanent mental institution. The flashbacks continue, and it becomes clear that Birdy's love of birds has turned into an obsession, and then into the darker realms beyond that.The final few minutes of the film cover a lot of ground; Al finally realises that Birdy is pretty well off the deep end; they both go off to fight in the war; Al gets his injury, while we see the incident that left Birdy in his present state. Meanwhile the doctor finally decides that time has run out, but Al decides he's not leaving.The ending of the film is incredibly powerful, and it should be a criminal offence to give it away. Is it 'appropriate' to the rest of the film? I dunno - but I thought it was pretty damn good.The film stands or falls on the performances of Cage and Modine - and, for me, it stands tall. Cage is excellent in his role, capturing the bravado of his character perfectly; but Modine is simply brilliant. During the flashbacks he portrays his nerdy character completely believably, but it's the way he handles the scenes in the asylum that amazed me. As soon as you know his obsession, it is crystal clear that he's not squatting in his cell, but perching, wishing to fly.Alan Parker has made some great films; this might just be his best.
