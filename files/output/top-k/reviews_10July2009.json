I figured I knew who James Dean was (having seen East of Eden a long time ago). I knew how he died. Yet another quasi- mythical actor persona. So I figured, OK a teenage coming-of-age movie with a dreamy-eyed actor version of Elvis. Ho hum.Wow, was I wrong. This is a really excellent movie, one of the top twenty or so I have ever seen. It is enormously more than just a teenage coming-of-age movie.It's understandable that all the reviews I have read of it here focus on the teenage aspect. After all, with three striking young stars, Dean, Wood, and Mineo, and a plot centered on teenagers and their parents, what else would you expect? And certainly there are many excellent pieces of dialog, plot, acting, and direction about teenagers, their angst, their self-serious self-involvement, their sexual awakenings, their striving to fit in, their parental difficulties. All of these things are really good. But there is more.The movie transcends that with its existential aspects. Who lives? asks Judy upon first meeting Jim. The planetarium show evokes the age old human questions, does anybody out there care? Is this all? The show at the planetarium emphasizes the death of the sun and the end of life on earth -- and who will care? Plato (love that name) is really scared, and Jim reaches out to him. When they are about to start the chicken race, Buzz and Jim have a conversation and Buzz says, we have to do something. On one level, that's an evocation of teenage life, but on a deeper level it's an existential statement about all human beings. Teenagers are taken as a symbol for everyone.There is the wonderful symbol of putting a coat around someone. You are cold, I will warm you. This is a recurrent theme, and a human answer to the existential dilemma.There are other symbols I love in this movie, like the recurring use of the color red, and the mismatched socks.I loved the secondary characters, especially the policeman, Jim's parents, his grandmother, and Judy's father (loved seeing William Hopper in a role away from Perry Mason). The opening ten minutes are really good. I loved the layout in the police station, and the sometimes understated interviews with the three main characters. The movie is full of wonderful little details, like Judy's compact in that opening sequence. A bit later we see that inside Plato's locker is a picture of Alan Ladd (so I've been told; I really didn't notice it that carefully). This movie was filmed right after the success of Shane, in which Ladd starred as a powerful mentor or father figure. Plato desperately wanted such a person in his life.James Dean is really impressive. I've read Dean actually improvised several great little touches in the movie. Improvising was encouraged by the director, Ray. In the opening scene in the police station, he imitates a police siren. Later on when the three of them are exploring the abandoned mansion, as they approach the swimming pool they are discussing children. I forget exactly what he says, but Dean imitates Mr. Magoo (the cartoon character) and says something about kids. That's especially ironic, as Jim Backus was the voice of Mr. Magoo! Also, in the opening scene while the credits are rolling, he is playing with a mechanical monkey toy (and wrapping it in a blanket - there's that symbol again); this was improvisation. I've read that at first the plan was for that opening sequence to be much more violent, a sort of teenage gang war. I'm glad they dropped that.Also impressive was Sal Mineo. Wow. Only Natalie Wood as Judy disappointed me a bit. I think the character she plays is realistic, but somehow I wanted something more. On the whole though, the three leads are superb. Apparently the studio was first considering - get this - the two main roles to be filled by Tab Hunter and Jane Mansfield (!!)If you have any qualms about this movie because it's just another teenage juvenile delinquent movie, put that aside.
