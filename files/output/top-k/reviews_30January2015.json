[{"date":"30 January 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" While Ebenezer Scrooge is the unquestionable main character of A Christmas Carol, without the other characters there wouldn't be much of a story. It is his role in contrast with the others that gives the spice to the story that Charles Dickens wrote. Scrooge's conversion happens after the spirits of Christmas past, present and future show him the life around him and his place in it for each period. So, the roles of those other characters are very important as well. This 1938 film is one of the best, and my favorite, of all the movie versions. I don't know why MGM made it so short &#x96; it's only 69 minutes, compared to 78 minutes for the 1935 Scrooge, and 86 minutes for the 1951 A Christmas Carol. It leaves out some parts of the story, especially some of Scrooge's past. Most important of that was his romance and his fiancé. Five to 10 more minutes showing some of that important past would have added significantly to this film version. But for that shortcoming, I think more people would see this film as the best. The counter to that shortcoming is the attention this version gives to the main supporting roles. We see more of the characters of Bob Cratchit, Tiny Tim, Marley's ghost, and Scrooge's nephew, Fred. And, the characters who play those roles give much more life and meaning to them. Gene Lockhart and wife Kathleen Lockhart play Bob and Mrs. Cratchit. Lockhart plays Bob as a man truly concerned about caring for his family. But, he's not about to let his ill-tempered miserly employer ruin Christmas for his family. He is a man of good spirits and hope, played better than in any other version. Terry Kilburn as Tiny Tim immediately steals one's heart. Not out of sympathy, but of empathy and joy at seeing this happy, innocent joyous character. Barry MacKay plays Fred with more ebullience and, I think, earnest concern and hope for his uncle's conversion of heart. And Leo G. Carroll gives the best rendition of Jacob Marley's ghost of any that I've seen. One particularly moving scene in this film that others don't have is Bob and Tiny Tim in church singing Oh Come All Ye Faithful. The camera close-ups of father and son exchanging glances depict deep love. The special effects in this film are quite exceptional for the time, and remain so today. In the midst of this story, Reginald Owens plays a perfect Scrooge. He is not the wide-eyed wonder that we see in Alastair Sim's Scrooge of 1951. But he seems genuine with an authentic conversion from the mean-spirited and cranky miser that we see in him at first. Two other pluses for this film are its musical background and realistic setting. This 1938 film and the 1951 version with Sims are a notch above a couple other versions. A 1970 musical version also is excellent. It stars Albert Finney and other leading British actors in wonderful roles. But this one remains my favorite for its deeper look at all the characters that Dickens created in A Christmas Carol.

I made it a point to go, as this is one of those movies that I know that I'd seen a time or two when I was a kid, but I also somehow managed not to ever see it in a theater when it came out. That may have been due to the slight bit of language in the film, which my mother probably deemed inappropriate for a seven year old. But what I know is that this is the kind of film that I either had watched at a friend's house during a sleepover or on TV with alterations, and as such was a movie that I had seen in bits and pieces, but perhaps not all the way straight through. At the very least I hadn't watched it in a very long time.Having now viewed the movie in a theater as an adult, I can say that it's an 80's masterpiece. The film follows a group of boys all of whom appear to be about 12 years old, along with their older, high school aged brother and a couple of girls from his school, all of whom set out (some unwittingly) on a scavenger hunt to find a buried treasure. The hunt finds them encountering a group of thieves who had robbed a bank in the movie's opening scenes, and the basic gist of the film is the hunt for the treasure while trying to evade these antagonists.What makes this movie special is that it's such a wonderfully told story, with fun characters and childish humor that is at both one and the same time juvenile and yet endearing. The film is perfect for youth who are coming of age, with a style that encompasses both child fantasy and adult themes. It's a great film for 11-15 year olds, but also for adults who just like fun movies. As I mentioned above, there is a very slight bit of language in the film, so perhaps my mother was right for not letting me see it as a seven year old. But, again, older kids should love it.The real genius of this movie, though, is that it's a perfect example of an iconic 80's teen movie. It's wonderfully hokey but still a real pleasure to watch. I give it 9\/10 stars!

It is also credited for renewing worldwide interest in World War II and also renewed popularity with old and new movies, TV shows, and video games. Saving Private Ryan set the bar very high for all war movies since its release. Steven Spielberg is a great director and Saving Private Ryan is easily one of his best movies of all time. The all star cast is fantastic.Saving Private Ryan starts with a World War II veteran bringing his family to the American cemetery at Normandy when he is overcome with emotion when visiting the graves of fellow soldiers who he served with. The film then flashes back to the Allied invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944. Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks in one of his best roles) leads the 2nd Ranger Battalion onto Omaha Beach to secure the beach and overcome the German defense amidst heavy casualties. While the opening 25 minute scene is unforgettable and excellently choreographed, this scene is a perfect depiction of the brutality of the horrors of war. It is realistically graphic and in no way glamorizes nor glorifies war unlike other movies.Meanwhile in Washington D.C. at the U.S. War Department, correspondence is being prepared to send to the various families notifying them of the loss of their loved ones during the war. In one of the saddest scenes of the movie in which you can't help but shed a tear, Mrs Ryan receives three letters on the same day notifying her that three of her sons were killed in action. A decision is made for the fourth son, Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), to be located and sent home immediately.The mission to find Private Ryan is handed to Captain Miller and his squad which includes his second in command Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore), the cynical machine gunner Private Rieben (Edward Burns), Jewish soldier Private Mellish (Adam Goldberg), the deeply religious sniper Private Jackson (Barry Pepper), medic Private Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), Italian-American soldier Private Carparzo (Vin Diesel in an early role), and a skilled translator Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies) who has not seen combat and finds himself bumbling throughout the mission and also resented by most of the squad members. The squad members find themselves questioning their mission to find one soldier and bring him home, but continue in their quest to locate Private Ryan as well as battling through numerous encounters with the German Army and confusion reigns as to whether Private Ryan is missing or presumably killed in action.The screenplay by Robert Rodat is excellent and cinematography by Janusz Kaminski perfectly captures the desaturated colour imagery of World War II. Steven Spielberg's eye for detail as well as the ability to bring out the emotional side of viewers is highly admirable. The cast, particularly Tom Hanks as Captain Miller as an everyman thrust into action as the leader of men is excellent and he makes this role his own. Matt Damon as the young Private James Ryan must also be highly commended. The rest of the cast such as Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel and Jeremy Davies shine in their respective outstanding roles.Also in the all star cast, Dennis Farina (a well known character actor who sadly passed away in 2013), Paul Giamatti (another character actor known for comedic roles), Bryan Cranston (before his famous role as Walter White in Breaking Bad), and Ted Danson (best known for TV shows Cheers and Becker) pop up in small roles in Saving Private Ryan.Saving Private Ryan is one of the few emotionally powerful movies that is capable of making grown men shed a tear, despite many unwilling to openly admit it. There are a few scenes, particularly the ending that evoke the emotional side of many viewers. Saving Private Ryan deserved its widespread critical acclaim and success at the box office. It also garnered numerous awards and Steven Spielberg was a well deserved winner, but in a complete travesty was unfairly robbed of the 1998 Best Picture Academy Award. Why Saving Private Ryan missed out on the Best Picture Academy Award I'll never know.Saving Private Ryan exhibits Steven Spielberg's finest movie to date, and this is certainly a very memorable movie for Tom Hanks.

Just another performance where Segal had to put in no effort other than flail around like a martial artist and Wayans was not funny (even though he is supposedly a comedian). This movie sounded like The Last Boy Scout (TLBS) when the character Maynard was mentioned (even more so when Wayans said it while sounding like his brother who was in TLBS). Except in TLBS the Wayan brother was a comic sidekick and the lead actor was sympathetic and funny unlike Segal's character in this who just seems to be fighting against everyone (even himself) for illogical reasons.Why does Segal's character always have to come from some eastern roots or be linked with some eastern philosophy (e.g. Buddhism in this case)? Doesn't make me believe he is the invincible fighter when seeing him un-co-ordinated and floundering around like someone in a sumo costume would move. His character always has their badge taken away by a yelling police officer and you know it's going to happen before it happens. NB. Steven Segal also had so much fake tan that he looked like a Halloween pumpkin. Watch at Halloween and you might enjoy seeing a pumpkin partially come to life.

More than anything else, it's all about the fun, and I just find it as great and entertaining a watch as it's always been. That's the true test of a classic horror flick, if you can see it over so many times and still it seems fresh, still it offers new insights, still it lends itself to bold and exciting new interpretations! And, you can still go to the bathroom in the middle of it without missing a thing! It's very straightforward and dead easy to get into. I mean, what an angle A teenage boy who's a big horror fan, he's seen all the movies, read all the stories, and he suddenly finds himself faced with a real monster who's moved in right next door and who soon knows that the boy knows about his true nature - what does he do? It's such a novel concept and one that plays out in such a satisfying way. The atmosphere is amazing, it doesn't ever drag and it doesn't take itself too seriously, not to say there are no scary moments or anything. It's helped a lot by a good cast. William Ragsdale as Charlie was fine, but he was kind of neurotic and boring for me, I thought he was overshadowed even by most of the smaller characters. He played the lead well, I just thought that the role could've been done a lot better and memorable by someone like Zach Galligan, say.. I loved his ditzy mother, she was a hoot! She kept coming out with such funny lines. I absolutely bloody adore Roddy McDowall in this, what a class act. He's simply priceless in his role as Peter Vincent, a meek and unlikely cowardly aged actor who becomes the hero he has played in a string of classic B-movie vampire pictures in his glory days after a graceful character arc in which he gains the courage and faith! to face his fear. And Chris Sarandon, he just played his vampiric character to perfection. I love the way he's got the whole charm and seduction thing down, but at the same time he has a certain little odd quirkiness to some of his lines and actions. And he was also perfectly intimidating and wrathful when he had to be. And although you understand how he's gotta go, you never really hate the guy, he's a very likable villain that I could 'dig', and that's half the battle right there at winning the audience of a horror movie over, if the bad guy's interesting and charismatic. I love all of the nifty and gruesome special effects, like the awesomely foreboding mist that swirls around Dandridge's humble abode and sets such a fabulous tone. There's the prosthetics and models of the prolonged sequence where poor strange Evil Ed slowly transforms back into a regular human following an impaling while in wolf form and dies.(Or does he?) I also love the brief but superb animation of the bat, and the little but effective gag of when Amy's dancing and sees a reflection that shows her dancing with thin air. I love that sequence, it's so vibrant and so of its time, it's like someone felt like indulging themselves by incorporating a glitzy music video into their movie and it's really 80s, really corny, and really epic!!! There is also the impressively gooey disintegration of the sexy and mysterious(Demon? Zombie?) Billy Cole, and the spectacular demise of Jerry Dandridge in which he kind of explodes to death. Some of the effects hold up a little better than others, but so what? There's such a charm there sometimes when you know that they had to put it all together themselves, and they clearly had a lot of love for the old vampire movies and the horror genre here, and you just very rarely get that anymore.

The funniest subplot is the sudden infatuation between Greg and Marcia (when it dawns on them that they're not REALLY brother and sister and&#x85;) while one of the best sequences is the public pool scene, embellished by black versions of Jan and Marcia, lol.The film runs 90 minutes and was shot in Santa Monica & Los Angeles, CA, and Hawaii.GRADE A- ","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"30 January 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I have been into movies since, well I was 5.

Well it took me a few minutes to get into it but well once i got engulfed it was just sheer pleasure and goosebumps.The film revolves around the inmates of a prison and a NEW FISH accused of homicide joining the faculty.The film depicts How he changed their lives and helped them to realize and bring back the greatest gift of life taken away from them . The friendship, the hardship, the simplest joy, the tragedies , the yearning for freedom in each breath has been brilliantly acted and directed.The movie makes you feel good.After watching it it makes you smile and strengthens your faith in humanity.I am no critic but this movie made me happy, ecstatic and I would love to re-watch it again and again. so i would say go on watch it at once if you have not. You will love it no matter what your taste in films are. Because this film expresses humanity in each way possible. And as a fellow human being you will love the emotions. If you don't then well I will be a bit surprised.P.S 1994 was the year of Forrest Gump. It took home all the awards. Though it is a great film but in my opinion it remains only great while shawshank is one of the greatest if not the greatest movie of all times. Thank You...

There's like a three minute scene of Malcolm McDowall just shooting darts out of a gun.

The second half is this absurd fantasy of violence begetting more senseless violence. The change in tone is jarring. If...we don't change our disciplinary structures this could happen.

However once I began watching it I was hooked. It starts off with catching you up to when the ship disappeared, which draws you in. And then mentions the reappearance, which captures you attention. I am fans of both Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neil when the movie began but you can bet after watching it I searched out more of their work. And it was the first time I had seen Joely Richardson but I was certainly impressed. The rest of the cast supported them all very well. I certainly believe that this movie was sorely under appreciated. The discovery of the recording, the flight log, and the first frozen body were all big moments I couldn't look away from. Laurence's character Captain Miller was brilliantly portrayed as strong and loyal, more so now after what had happened prior to the movie. Yet perhaps the best performance in my opinion was Neil's Dr. Weir's slow decent into madness. This movie was unnerving chilling and scary, but not in the usual horror movie way. So I leave you with the best quote of the movie (in my opinion) Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
