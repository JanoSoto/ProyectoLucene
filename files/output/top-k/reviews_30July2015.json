I typically start with the good things about a movie, but there are no good things in this movie. I have a very high tolerance for bad movies, and can enjoy lots of terrible movies just for how bad they are, but this movie...man, sometimes this thing is hard to sit through. So what's wrong with this movie? Well everything, but aside from that... 1) The characters and lore are completely butchered. I haven't read all that many Batman comics, but I am quite a big fan, and am well-versed in the character (reasonably so, anyway), or I thought I was, because in no Batman comics I've read or heard about, has Batman appeared at a public party. That happens in this movie, Batman and Robin are up there on stage, at a party. I mean, yeah they're waiting there to take down Mr. Freeze, but seriously, does that sound like Batman? How about Batgirl? Y'know, Barbara Gordon? Sorry, I forgot, in this movie Barbara isn't Gordon's daughter, she's Alfred's niece! Wait, what? Remember Knightfall? And Bane, one of the best Batman villains ever? Well, in this movie he will be reduced to nothing more than a hulking, mindless brute capable of only grunting a few words here and there. Why? WHY? 2) the cast. George Clooney as Batman. Who thought that would work? He's stiff, he seems bored, and I didn't buy him at all as a physical presence. Though, I'm not dis-crediting Clooney, for what he had to work with, I can't imagine anyone would care about trying to give a good performance. Arnold Schwarzenneger plays a Mr. Freeze who only speaks in one-liners. Chill! You're not sending me to the cooler! Allow me to break the Ice! I've always thought Uma Thurman's acting skills are suspect (though I haven't seen her in much), but I could've bought her as Poison Ivy in a movie like Batman Forever, but here? She's terrible! She's so over the top, and Ivy (who cares about plants and wants them to rule) tries to get Freeze to freeze Gotham! And that brings me to the biggest problem in this movie.

Schumacher did the opposite. He made the whole thing a live action cartoon, which could never be taken seriously (even as a Saturday morning cartoon) and takes the series back to where it was before Burton helped Batman become a serious icon. Now, it was just back to being a joke. That being said, I do still enjoy this movie. Because, c'mon, where else can you get so much ridiculousness? It's a terrible movie, and if you view it as an actual movie to be taken seriously, you'll probably be appalled. If you view it as an adaptation of Batman, you will also be appalled. if you view it as a terrible movie to be laughed at, you'll probably have good time, at least for a little while.
