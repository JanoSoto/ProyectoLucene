This movie in my opinion is pure genius and anyone who thinks otherwise is missing the bigger meaning of the film.Nay-sayers see the film as quote one big gay\/lesbian joke, which is far from the true. The movie is Kevin Smith's perception on relationships and the mishaps that always ensue. But instead of using the typical plot line the usually goes something like boy meets girl, boy likes girl - girl likes boy,girl and\/or boy have some deep dark cliché skeleton in their closet that isn't leaked out till the last 45 minutes of the film so then boy and girl break up , boy and girl whine and pout till the last 10 minutes where boy and girl reunite ,resolve conflict and live happily ever after(cue sappy love song).He used sexual confusion which lets face it is a highly touchy issue with most people so when viewers realized Holden was chasing after a lesbian thats all the film became known as.These viewers will watch every single love-lorn drama where it's the same story different characters and call it poetic genius ,but the minute some real live and in your face relationship issues are discussed and also are poked fun at they can't hack it.So to these people my advice is to watch the movie again and instead of dwelling on the gay\/lesbian innuendos , try to view it as a romantic comedy with dramatic undertones of self-doubt and people's perceptions and how they alter relationships and people's lives.

Now that I've seen it, I'm not sure what to think... I don't know for sure if I agree with the common opinion that this is his least impressive film(even less impressive than The Shining). Don't get me wrong, it is a good film, but it just seems... I don't know, unfinished, rushed... like Kubrick didn't spend as much time filming as he should have. Maybe it's the actors, I don't know. It just seems... uneven, somehow. The plot is very good, and has a pretty good pace... but there are places where you're bored, and the film seemed to end too suddenly, I think(despite the film being quite long). The acting is, not unlike The Shining, less impressive than most of Kubrick's other films. Cruise is not an actor with a lot of range, that's for sure. Kidman is mostly believable, but, like Cruise, she seems more like an actor playing a part than the actual character, which distances us from their characters and thereby from the film itself. Not good. The characters are well-written, credible and interesting. The story is interesting, evolves at a very good pace and provides food for thought. I liked how the film presented infidelity and sex in general as acts lust and desire rather than affiliating them with love or emotion. I've heard many complain that the film was lacking sex scenes. This is a Kubrick film; just because the subject matter is directly intertwined with sex, doesn't mean that he's going to do the typical, simple Hollywood thing and just pack the movie with sex scenes. A talentless director could(and probably would) have done that. Anyone can make sex look appealing to the general public. It's much, much harder to make it seem unappealing and in fact almost disgusting... but Kubrick succeeds. He reminds us that sex is just a bodily function, something between two people that doesn't actually require emotions. It's physical by nature. The soundtrack is quite good too... there is a classical piece that can bring you to the edge of your seat just listening to it, and Kubrick pairs it up with great visuals. Maybe I should let you know that, while this I think this is one of his lesser films, it is still definitely a Kubrick piece. No doubt about it. Perfectly framed shots, slow pans and zooms, great music... and the ending, albeit being a bit sudden and leaving the viewer somewhat unsatisfied, still has the Kubrick touch and, whilst appearing to resolve the film, it also hints at something more sinister and unsettling. A good, maybe even great, film by the master of innovative storytelling, Stanley Kubrick. I recommend it to any fan of Kubrick. Anyone who isn't a fan, or at the very least isn't used to his style of film, should consider watching some of his other films first, as this is one of his heavier and less impressive ones(at least in my opinion). 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"30 December 2004","score":"0 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" After having seen just about every single of Kubrick's films(The only films that are left are Spartacus, Lolita and his short films) and a documentary about him(Stanley Kubrick A Life in Pictures), I was looking forward to seeing his last film, despite it's reputation.

But for some reason the movie didn't really capture me until the end. I think there were a lot of moments of boredom and I liked the realistic subject matter, where two friends promise to marry, better then the actual movie, or how it was played out, itself.

The situation-two friends promising they'll marry at a certain age-is something I dug and certain aspects were very true to life but other situations seemed hopelessly contrived and very sitcomish.

He gave up movies after seeing this flick...they were just getting too weird and disturbing for an old rancher like him. It's still pretty terrifying, even if you've seen it again and again. You know what bad, brutal scenes are coming and don't want to see the carnage again, but can't help yourself. It's ominous as the crows flock tighter and tighter, always more and more, on the schoolyard Monkey-Bars and it's also exciting to see the school kids chased down by the crows a few minutes later. Subplots like the pitiful neurosis of Lydia Brenner, Mitch & Annie's lost-love-affair, Mitch's indifference to the needs of others, and the poor-little-rich-girl Melanie, who still just wants her mommie, are all well-written and acted. Loved best by me is Hitchcock's humorous characters who are CHARACTERS! The old drunk at the bar quoting Holy Scripture, the nosy neighbor done wonderfully by Richard Deacon, the dowdily-dressed old intellectual in the cafe buying her cigarettes and evidently a scientific expert for any field. Sir Alfred's macabre touches of comedy are unmatched, even in today's thrillers. I'm repulsed and attracted by such scenes as the one in the farmhouse, where Jessica Tandy discovers an old friend pecked to death, with his eye sockets bloody and empty. I find myself still searching for gory details on the farmer's body because Hitch didn't let the camera dwell on the horrible face too long. But he DID give us two rapid jump-cuts with closer and closer close-ups, and we end up seeing just as much detail as Jessica just did - enough to know that We gotta git outta there! Overall, a fine time. 119 minutes of revolting fun!

So I revisited the film again last night. Even though it has been over 15 years since I first saw this film, I still really enjoyed it. I was very surprised to see so many negative comments here on IMDb. All in all, the film is a little dated, but it still contains some very striking visuals and original ideas. The sets used for this film were extremely well detailed and thought out, as were the costumes and props. Hector is perhaps one of the coolest looking cyborg\/robot characters ever conceived. The scene where he is first booted up and filled with cyber-blood is just vivid and stunning. After watching this film, it was also *quite* obvious that this movie influenced some of the more modern science fiction masterpieces like Robocop, the (1st) Matrix and James Cameron's Aliens. Several of the reviews harshly criticized the acting and the story, but I however found no problems in this department. Nowadays we seldom see good films with a small cast and a simple story. Not every movie has to be as advanced and as complex as films like Minority Report. And I am sorry, but Mark Hamill and Keanu Reeves can't hold a candle to Kirk Douglas and Harvey Keitel when it comes to acting. I think people are trying to compare this film to all the super budget modern sci-fi movies. Or perhaps this movie is regarded as crap by many because they think Star Wars is the end all, be all sci-fi movie of all time, which in my opinion, Star Wars is MUCH more cheesy and way too light-hearted to take seriously. If you like serious, dark sci-fi flicks, be sure to check this one out. Don't listen to all those Star Wars nerds who crap on this film.

A trilogy ends when a character grows too old to adventure (Free Willy 3); his personality is off; an actor looks\/sounds too different (Batman & Robin); or an important person is cut (Free Willy 3). This had all, & it wasn't SUPPOSED to end! Bastian's dad remarries, so he moves to a new school, where he's attacked by the Nasties. He escapes into the Neverending Story but leaves it lying around so the Nasties find it & plan to bombard the Nastiness on Fantasia (& thus Bastian) & Earth. (The reason isn't given; they just use nastiness like a theme.) He returns to Earth to escape Fantasia, but some characters travel too (don't know why; I thought the Story never went wrong). Now he has to get the book, & the Auryn which his jerky stepsister swipes. Richter doesn't look or sound like Bastian, who's bitter & demanding; Falkor looks like a dog & has less advice to give; the Emperess was cold. Even the Auryn didn't glimmer like the 1st, or whir and shine like the 2nd; just glowed & hummed! The Nasties look like they've been held back 15 years & aren't scary; they're more like poltergeists than bullies. The crustacean was a better villain; too bad it wasn't 1st.

I realized that I had been cheated of quality. In my opinion there are a few things\/elements that make a film good.First of all the actors have to be good and Ewan McGregor is a very fine actor and does his part but Hayden Christensen is such a terrible actor it actually made me long for Jake Lloyd (who played Anakin in the first movie). There was no depth in his portrayal of Anakin Skywalker and he didn't act very well with all the CG elements that are in the film so you don't believe that he is facing a big kind of bull monster. All you see when you look at his acting is a blue screen. Natalie Portman is equally pointless and is at no point believable. Especially at the of the film she falls out of a speeding airplane and then proceeds to get up and go of bright as a daisy. Furthermore her love for Anakin just doesn't seem real. Samuel L. Jackson who is usually a fine actor plays very badly in this film. This great actor is being reduced to swinging a light saber saying crappy lines and attempting to look cool. Temuera Morrison who plays Jango Fett is for lack of a better word boring. All his attempts to seem devious and cunning is ruined first of all by terrible facial expressions and secondly terrible accent. Christopher Lee provides an adequate villain but ultimately has too little time on screen to seem believable.The second thing that needs to work is the story and I'm afraid to say that it doesn't. The characters don't seem to grow they are just there and the whole love story between Padme and Anakin seems out of place and often becomes way to boring and overly emotional. Nothing like what the relationship between Han and Leia was in the first films.

This is largely because the situations, characters, settings and even fashions are so slice of life. It's a lot more convincing than a lot of the Sean Penn stuff at the moment, and even hyper-real stuff like Gummo or Julian Donkey Boy. I think this is because there's no exaggeration in Get Carter. It's not shot in some weird hicky town in the middle of nowhere, it's shot in Newcastle, one of the UK's major cities. And Get Carter tells it like it is. It is this no-nonsense style that still makes it look one of the coolest films around. Also, there aren't any heroes, which is a good thing. Well, how many 'heroes' have you met? Carter, though no hero, is a great character, make no mistake about that, and he shows just enough emotion for the audience to identify with him like when he stumbles across his dead brother's daughter in some seedy porn film, and the whole motivation for his revenge mission in the first place. But he is a cold blooded killer too, hardened by London's gangland, and violence is his main emotional outlet in everything else - sex etc - he's pretty cool. It's not just the killers he's after, it's anyone even associated with it. And he dispatches them with a passion. I know you didn't kill him!! I know!! and Goodbye ----!! being two memorable sign offs. I really do believe this is a better film than Godfather. Godfather exists in a world most of us will never experience and is one of the best Hollywood films. Get Carter though, exists in our world, and the superb characters, acting and writing make it totally believable - even when Michael Caine walks naked out of the door of his seedy B & B with his shotgun to escort out some local hoods, the most memorable thing you remember about the scene is the previously belligerent moaning old lady neighbour scurrying into her house, terrified. Oh, and Budd's soundtrack is pure sleazy brilliance, well up to the standard of virtually everything else about the film.

A mighty directional debut for Sidney Lumet, who was also associated with such memorable films as; Murder On The Orient Express, Dog Day Afternoon and Network. It's a story about 12 jury members deliberating on the fate of an 18 year old boy (on trial for the murder of his father). One man stands alone (Henry Fonda) trying to convince the other 11 not to be so hasty with a guilty verdict. It's quite amazing how the story unfolds by only verbal context, there's no flash backs on what went on in the courtroom or the presumed scenario of the murder. All is done by script alone and to this basis the viewer has to pay particular attention. The cast is superb, not big stars at the time, but in later years very well known.

I could sum it up in a lovely gagging noise. Not only was the acting intolerable, but it was like they didn't even bother with reading the book. The book itself was never structurally made to be brought to the screen. The concept of a vampire rising from his 'sleep' to join a rock band, simply works better in writing then in moving pictures. Even if Tom Cruise himself hadn't passed over the role, it still would not even have risen near acceptable. Tom Cruise was Lestat without a doubt. Townsend pretty much destroyed the character! He raped Lestat of his personality, his cunning, his wit, and every other trait we've come to adore him for. Townsend turned Lestat into nothing more than a jerk with an ego problem and a lust for groupie blood. Other characters were also maimed in the making of this film. Marius's portrayal especially made me cringe. In the books, Marius is a LONG BLONDE haired, BLUE eyed roman man. NOT, and I repeat NOT a short dark haired, brown eyed Spanish man!! I love Vincent Perez, he did wonderfully in The City of Angels...but failed miserably in Queen of the Damned. Now another blaring moment, is that fact that a good share of main characters are MISSING. Louis and Armand do not make a reappearance. Gabrielle is gone. Maharet's sister is missing. Or in some cases characters were diminished. I believe I saw Mael at some point, but he was never given a name. Same with Pandora. I only knew she was in the movie because the credits told me so. Well there is so much more I could detail, but there is a word limit. Strictly speaking Queen of the Damned fell so far behind its predecessor that I don't blame Stuart Townsend for basically disappearing off the face of the earth.

Donald Woods is Cyrus Zorba, a paleontologist down on his luck. His furniture has just been removed from his flat and his wife and two children, Medea and Buck, seem used to being in continual dire financial straits. While sitting on the floor for Buck's birthday party, a creepy message comes telling Cyrus to see a lawyer in the morning. Cyrus and wife Rosemary Decamp go and discover that Cyrus has inherited a huge mansion from his Uncle Plato as well as a package containing some weird type of glasses. It seems that Uncle Plato collected ghosts. The rest of the story details what life is like in this house that has these ghosts. I did not have the pair of glasses so cannot tell you what it looked like in Illusion-O, but I bet it was even more fun. Castle always seems to do a good job at creating entertaining, fun films, though none of them ever seem to be much more than that either. The mystery is not hard to figure out at all. The acting is good all around with youngster Charles Herbert giving a nice performance as Buck. Woods is good as the family patriarch and Jo Morrow is just beautiful as daughter Medea. Martin Milner plays Ben the lawyer. And as a retainer in the house is Elaine, played by none other than Margaret Hamilton(always a joy to see her). When Ben first arrives at the house to see how the Zorbas are doing, Buck says ring the bell and you'll see a witch. Of course the witch reference goes throughout the whole film as Hamilton looks witch-like and this is one marvelous inside gag about her Wizard of Oz performance. The effects for the film are pretty tame and very hokey, but this film is just good, old-fashioned fun. I liked it from beginning to end. If you loved the new one and decide to go back and see the old one - you will be very disappointed. Just as I was disappointed having seen the old one and moving to the new one.

The previous comment said she was too distant and cold. Well, she was an insurance investigator, not a daycare provider. This was 1968 when women really had to be businesslike to make their way in the world and this also is the image of the writer of her character. What I loved was the minimalist dialog, the incredible lighting and composition in every frame (Haskell Wexler's genius at work), especially during the best scene ever of a chess match. This was totally film as film--it was a scene that could only come to life in film. It was such a pleasure to see a filmmaker rely on the photography, music and facial expressions of the actors to build a scene instead of another bang up car crash. The camera loved both actors' faces, but especially Steve McQueen's cragginess and leanness. I love witty dialog, but this minimalist approach worked because it fit the characters. And the end was perfect because it totally fit the characters. She was an investigator and just because she fell in love she wasn't prepared or able to abandon the way she had lived her life--within the law. He couldn't abandon his life choices either, because he'd only end up in jail without her anyway. A happy ending would have meant she was an entirely different person than we were led to believe.

I can see how young Gen-Xers must have thought this was coolest movie ever, but I think the humor just doesn't apply today. The Reagan administration is long gone, televangelism is dead, Zen has gotten old, and basically everything else the movie flips off has changed or disappeared. It is a great satire of the decade, but you have to understand every facet of the 80's to get it. Dr. Strangelove, which this has been compared to, was a good satire of another decade that still remains understandable and relevant. Repo Man, however, is severely lacking in timelessness... a key ingredient for a movie like this.6\/10 stars.

I think it runs pretty cheap on Amazon or wherever else you do your DVD shopping. Anyway, the movie sums up pretty simply as a bunch of ghost pirates slicing and dicing up the locals of a coastal town. Because they're understandably upset about some business with the town's ancestors from a hundred years back. Either way, the movie is really creepy at times. There's a great scene near the beginning where the passengers on a fishing boat get righteously hacked up. It's nice to see a film where people get savagely executed by way of sickle and sword. I love stuff like this, don't you? I think this is one of Carpenter's better films and it has a great cast with Tom Atkins, John Houseman, Hal Holbrook, Adrienne Barbeau, and Jamie Lee Curtis with mom Janet Leigh! The ghost pirates are much scarier than the ones from Pirates of the Caribbean. What else can I say about this movie other than it's always funny when you have butchering murderers polite enough to knock on your door before running you through with a dull blade? Yar, mateys! This ship runs its course well it does! Yar! RATING ***1\/2 out of *****.

I have seen it numerous times since I was ten and my brother and I are always cracking up. There are a few scenes that should be classics. Movie is about three silent movie actors who take themselves way to seriously. This results in getting them fired. There's the child star, the 'goodlooking\/charming' one and the one who considers himself the leader. Once they get a letter from a Mexican girl who asked them to save her village after seeing one of their movies and believing it's real, it's the three amigo's to the rescue!!!I love the part at the Singing Bush and the part where they are trying to break into the film studio, with Steve Martin making all the bird noises. It's probably not the best collaboration of SNL-actors but still...This is good entertainment!
