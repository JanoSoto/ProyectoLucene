Any serious film fan knows of the French New Wave, the movement in the 1950s and 1960s that sparked the American film movement in the 1960s and inspired our own New Wave in the 1970s. Of that period, perhaps the most well-known director is Jean-Luc Godard, and his best known work is Breathless.A rather interesting title, because that is exactly what this movie is. Of course there is a twenty-some minute scene in a hotel room that brings the narrative to a screeching halt, but that as well was revolutionary and daring for any film in that day. The new and exciting techniques and attitude of Breathless are what create its reputation and why it is considered so important in the history of film. However, it can also be approached simply as the story of a wanna-be gangster who wants the girl he longs for to run away with him but has the law on his tail as well.Of course, could Breathless be as it is without the fascinating performances of its leads, in particular Jean Seberg as Patricia? Jean-Paul Belmondo plays it straight and we need that to take us through the story, but Seberg always detracts from the audience and that is part of the intrigue. What does she really think of Michel, and what will she do with him? Their scene in the hotel room is absorbing not only because of how Godard shot it with available light, overhead angles and those famous jump cuts, but also the dialogue. What are these people talking about and why? The subject in discussion changes hands frequently, but they both have the same goal in mind the whole time Michel to sleep with Patricia and Patricia to find out about Michel.The opening is unique in that we get no back story; just plunge right into this world and the surroundings that come with it. Speaking of which, is there a better backdrop then Paris? Perhaps not, and that is only part of what makes this an unforgettable experience. Certainly, it needs to be seen multiple times, but I get the feeling that many will get its message the first time. The true message Godard was trying to relate was the world is changing, and that includes the cinema.

How does he do it? He takes away his greatest pain. Many think this to be a stupid idea, but if you asked me, it is highly intellectual and a stroke of genius. Perhaps it is just handled the wrong way, from a directorial point of view. What I will attempt in this comment is not only to see things the way they are, but also how Shatner had originally envisioned them to be, but failed to do right, either by the lack of money or the lack of his own directorial skills. This brings me back to the point I started from. Why has the first guy we see on screen to be a drooling, speech impeded, nobody. Hell, even Abe Lincoln had a brighter future when he picked up his ticket at the box office. This guy would have done everything to get off this rock, even follow a mad man. But I think the idea itself is brilliant. How many movies do we know, where we pause for a moment and the hero tells somebody what is eating him, what his drive is, why he does what he does. By now, this has become a bit of a cliché. But Star Trek V makes it a plot point, a way to literally show us the feelings of our beloved characters. The sad thing is, it is not done very well, or at least not consequently. Although I like the Spock and McCoy scenes, we are not shown anything from the rest. Why waste screen time for the three emissaries on Nimbus III since they are nothing more than a McGuffin in the first half of the movie and almost completely disappear in the latter one. This time could have easily been used for the Enterprise crew, given them a more dignified role in the events depicted. It was a good thing of Shatner to give everyone something to do, but almost everything shown is done in a fun way and contradicts the character. We see the navigator and the helmsman get lost; the engineer bumps his head in engineering, and a lady pushing sixty performing a strip dance as if she were 20. Granted, those horny hicks in the desert probably did not care, but we as viewers are put out of the movie, another failure of the movie. While in Star Trek II it was made a point that Kirk is aging and the crew is aging, is this one, everybody is shown more agile than back in the original show. If we compare the appearance of Kirk in this movie and the next, he has aged almost ten years, despite the making of the two is only two years apart. Kirk is free-climbing in this and we are supposed to believe it. Then again, he falls right. Nevertheless the climbing scenes are a beautiful montage for the title credits and give the movie scale. The title credits as originally conceived by Shatner would have been one consecutive shot, beginning with a zoom out (following the first Sybock scene) of Nimbus three, then we go into space, travel to earth and then a zoom in on earth ending in an aerial shot of Yosemite, ala the Powers of Ten. (http\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AUUkjWsNC9k&feature=fvst) Great idea, would have been awesome, but alas, not enough money. The filmed special effects by Associates and Ferren are bad. Someone said that their limited facilities, which resulted in a lack of time, had prevented them from doing multiple passes on the starships and models, thus not giving the shots depth and credibility. The in camera effects on the other hand look very good for the most part. We have the back projected star field whenever we look out of a window and that is very convincing, also giving the director the freedom to move the camera, a luxury that a blue screen background would have prevented back then. Another plus point are the transitions we get during the flashbacks of McCoy and Spock. Also done practically and very good. The only time the back projection did not work that good are the main viewer scenes. Since the bridge is lit very brightly, the contrast on the viewer is a bit low, but nothing to complain really. The bridge is very good in this one, as are most of the sets, beautifully lit and filmed. The camera-work is a highpoint of this film. One of my favorite scenes is the camera push in on the bridge, passing the actors ending on a monitor which shows us the approaching bird of prey. Someone called this an almost Hitchcockian moment, perhaps referring to the crane shot in Notorious. It is a very good moment that introduces us to the more than disappointing ending of this flick. Again, time, money and unconvincing special effects prevented this one from being what Shatner wanted it to be. I wonder if it had worked. Surely, he is not the best director, but the good stuff in his movie works very well and the major flaw is perhaps him directing himself. His whole performance screams leading man and hero, something that director Nick Meyer tried to reduce in his movies, with success. No wonder Shatner got the Razzie for acting.The dialog by David Loughery is over the top, out of character and silly. Harve Bennett euphemised it as his delightful almost whimsical sense of humor in the DVD featurette The Jouurney Begins, but I don't know. I could go on and on making this movie bad, despite liking it, dreaming of how it could have been. I think they should give him the money to fix this. On the other hand, I wonder, why Shatner does not put up the money himself.

How does he do it? He takes away his greatest pain. Many think this to be a stupid idea, but if you asked me, it is highly intellectual and a stroke of genius. Perhaps it is just handled the wrong way, from a directorial point of view. What I will attempt in this comment is not only to see things the way they are, but also how Shatner had originally envisioned them to be, but failed to do right, either by the lack of money or the lack of his own directorial skills. This brings me back to the point I started from. Why has the first guy we see on screen to be a drooling, speech impeded, nobody. Hell, even Abe Lincoln had a brighter future when he picked up his ticket at the box office. This guy would have done everything to get off this rock, even follow a mad man. But I think the idea itself is brilliant. How many movies do we know, where we pause for a moment and the hero tells somebody what is eating him, what his drive is, why he does what he does. By now, this has become a bit of a cliché. But Star Trek V makes it a plot point, a way to literally show us the feelings of our beloved characters. The sad thing is, it is not done very well, or at least not consequently. Although I like the Spock and McCoy scenes, we are not shown anything from the rest. Why waste screen time for the three emissaries on Nimbus III since they are nothing more than a McGuffin in the first half of the movie and almost completely disappear in the latter one. This time could have easily been used for the Enterprise crew, given them a more dignified role in the events depicted. It was a good thing of Shatner to give everyone something to do, but almost everything shown is done in a fun way and contradicts the character. We see the navigator and the helmsman get lost; the engineer bumps his head in engineering, and a lady pushing sixty performing a strip dance as if she were 20. Granted, those horny hicks in the desert probably did not care, but we as viewers are put out of the movie, another failure of the movie. While in Star Trek II it was made a point that Kirk is aging and the crew is aging, is this one, everybody is shown more agile than back in the original show. If we compare the appearance of Kirk in this movie and the next, he has aged almost ten years, despite the making of the two is only two years apart. Kirk is free-climbing in this and we are supposed to believe it. Then again, he falls right. Nevertheless the climbing scenes are a beautiful montage for the title credits and give the movie scale. The title credits as originally conceived by Shatner would have been one consecutive shot, beginning with a zoom out (following the first Sybock scene) of Nimbus three, then we go into space, travel to earth and then a zoom in on earth ending in an aerial shot of Yosemite, ala the Powers of Ten. (http\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AUUkjWsNC9k&feature=fvst) Great idea, would have been awesome, but alas, not enough money. The filmed special effects by Associates and Ferren are bad. Someone said that their limited facilities, which resulted in a lack of time, had prevented them from doing multiple passes on the starships and models, thus not giving the shots depth and credibility. The in camera effects on the other hand look very good for the most part. We have the back projected star field whenever we look out of a window and that is very convincing, also giving the director the freedom to move the camera, a luxury that a blue screen background would have prevented back then. Another plus point are the transitions we get during the flashbacks of McCoy and Spock. Also done practically and very good. The only time the back projection did not work that good are the main viewer scenes. Since the bridge is lit very brightly, the contrast on the viewer is a bit low, but nothing to complain really. The bridge is very good in this one, as are most of the sets, beautifully lit and filmed. The camera-work is a highpoint of this film. One of my favorite scenes is the camera push in on the bridge, passing the actors ending on a monitor which shows us the approaching bird of prey.

This foursome was so hot after this movie that some of them couldn't demean themselves by starring in the sequel. Poor them as, just a short eight years later, they all jumped at the opportunity to reunite with fast cars in the fourth installment. Oh how the mighty fall, especially when they weren't too mighty in the first place. I had my own preconceptions about this popcorn flick, virtually making me never want to take a chance on it at all. I thought the acting would be amateurish and campy, the story ludicrously absurd, and the cheese factor too high to overcome. Well, after finally sitting down to check it out I realized that I was clairvoyant. I wanted to at least have fun, and for a couple moments I did, but overall this Rob Cohen disaster is a throwaway that only shows how influential teenage boys are in the Hollywood spectrum. How else could we have three theatrically released sequels to what could be a made-for-TV movie at best? I see the similarities to Point Break, as my friend told me existed. It even goes to the point where if I closed my eyes I could have believed Paul Walker was Keanu Reeves. Where this film goes wrong, though, is by having Brewster's character involved, taking Walker's love away from Diesel. What works so well in the before-mentioned Kathryn Bigelow film is that there is more than just allusions to a man-crush between Reeves and Patrick Swayze. That dynamic doesn't quite exist here. Walker's Spilner\/O'Connor may respect Diesel's Toretto, but he never idolizes the man. He sees a misguided soul that watched as his father burned to death on the racetrack, he sees a man who is nothing without his sister and racing team&#x97;his own makeshift family. Whether it is Toretto who is behind the truck-jacking or not, Walker is only staying close to find out, and get with Brewster's Mia of course.Speaking of the truck-jacking, is it just me or is that opening scene completely out-of-place? The film begins with four Hondas harassing a trucker, taking the driver out and, I guess, stealing the shipment. The cut is so abrupt that you never do find out what they do with the cargo, if anything. In fact, having the next scene in daylight with Walker, I thought maybe he was involved already, waiting for the criminals to meet up with him. Instead, he just floors his car, swears, and is all of a sudden at Mia's diner. It is so discombobulating that I seriously wanted to just turn it off. Only when Walker goes back to work at Harry's do we find out why he swore driving, and it's even longer until we find out where the trucks come into play. But this isn't trying to win awards for storytelling, it's just doing its best to entertain and titillate. Unfortunately, it did very little of either.The acting is pretty horrid across the board with Rodriguez probably the best of the four in a limited role. I didn't mind Diesel too much, the guy has charisma, but Walker's Keanu-speak was distracting because I don't remember him ever talking like that in other films. And when the cast is rounded off by stilted delivery from Rick Yune, Ja Rule, and Matt Schulze&#x97;the moment when Brewster asks Walker out and Schulze elbows the wall in anger made me laugh&#x97;you know you shouldn't be expecting very much else. Although, Chad Lindberg, as the whiz-kid engine technician, showed a lot of promise.

Oh how the mighty fall, especially when they weren't too mighty in the first place. I had my own preconceptions about this popcorn flick, virtually making me never want to take a chance on it at all.

I wanted to at least have fun, and for a couple moments I did, but overall this Rob Cohen disaster is a throwaway that only shows how influential teenage boys are in the Hollywood spectrum. How else could we have three theatrically released sequels to what could be a made-for-TV movie at best? I see the similarities to Point Break, as my friend told me existed. It even goes to the point where if I closed my eyes I could have believed Paul Walker was Keanu Reeves. Where this film goes wrong, though, is by having Brewster's character involved, taking Walker's love away from Diesel. What works so well in the before-mentioned Kathryn Bigelow film is that there is more than just allusions to a man-crush between Reeves and Patrick Swayze. That dynamic doesn't quite exist here. Walker's Spilner\/O'Connor may respect Diesel's Toretto, but he never idolizes the man. He sees a misguided soul that watched as his father burned to death on the racetrack, he sees a man who is nothing without his sister and racing team&#x97;his own makeshift family. Whether it is Toretto who is behind the truck-jacking or not, Walker is only staying close to find out, and get with Brewster's Mia of course.Speaking of the truck-jacking, is it just me or is that opening scene completely out-of-place? The film begins with four Hondas harassing a trucker, taking the driver out and, I guess, stealing the shipment. The cut is so abrupt that you never do find out what they do with the cargo, if anything. In fact, having the next scene in daylight with Walker, I thought maybe he was involved already, waiting for the criminals to meet up with him. Instead, he just floors his car, swears, and is all of a sudden at Mia's diner. It is so discombobulating that I seriously wanted to just turn it off. Only when Walker goes back to work at Harry's do we find out why he swore driving, and it's even longer until we find out where the trucks come into play. But this isn't trying to win awards for storytelling, it's just doing its best to entertain and titillate. Unfortunately, it did very little of either.The acting is pretty horrid across the board with Rodriguez probably the best of the four in a limited role. I didn't mind Diesel too much, the guy has charisma, but Walker's Keanu-speak was distracting because I don't remember him ever talking like that in other films. And when the cast is rounded off by stilted delivery from Rick Yune, Ja Rule, and Matt Schulze&#x97;the moment when Brewster asks Walker out and Schulze elbows the wall in anger made me laugh&#x97;you know you shouldn't be expecting very much else.

There's not a solid plot to speak of, more-so a character study of two cops, one older one younger, who are partnered up and have to tackle the ghettos and slums, loaded with Blue (Crips) and Red) (Bloods), and also the various Hispanic gangs that are not as notorious but still as powerful and dangerous.It's a series of pieces that soon take shape into a story, but it's not even about that. It's just about following these gangs and being true to their nature of their rites of passage (beating up the new kids and setting them off to prove themselves), their bond and codes, their can-do attitude even when they're behind bars or in hand-cuffs, and the collective wisdom that you can either talk to a cop or just run... or, another alternative, shoot. It's also about a value system and class differences; the former relating, of course, to Hodges (Duvall) and Penn, who don't see eye to eye on how to apprehend suspects or treat them. Penn's younger guy isn't a crooked cop or corrupted, but he's a hot-head, a junkie for adrenaline, while Duvall's been around the block way too many times (and even admits that he had a higher post before and is still on the streets for reasons not totally made clear) to put up with being like a gangster as he says.And the class part relates to the difference between McGavin (Penn) and his supposed girlfriend, who comes from the Latino parts of the hood and has family that Hodges has come in contact with as a cop, putting them up against the wall.

La Grande Illusion, or Grand Illusion in English, is one of those.It's a French movie about a group of French officers taken captive by Germans during WWI, and their plight to escape. Although, on a deeper level, it's about the proletariat taking over Europe from the upper class, the nobles and all the other various bourgeois. It's not a Marxist piece, but it's more about the dying of the bourgeois because they aren't needed anymore. It's a celebration of the common man, but somehow still placing the nobles above them. The projected theory is like a nobleman's view of communism, if that makes sense.There are lots of flaws in it. For example, I watched the first ten minutes twice, and never did understand what was going on. After that, it's coherent, but the first bit is horrible. It's badly edited as well, although that's a result of it being created in 1937, and probably being lost several times. And the actors are a product of their acting generation, being trained in the theatrical style, very evidently not the same caliber as actors of today's generation.But the story is nothing short of genius. It has been ripped off by many other movie classics, from The Great Escape to Casablanca. It's not a terribly serious movie, even though it's about prisoners of war. They're all captains, so they are treated like guests in a palace, and yet they still try to escape. That is the most striking message to me, about everyone's search for freedom. At first, it's unclear who are the main characters. But then it focuses on three men. All are high- ranking officials, but one is from a noble name, a long lineage of the bourgeois, somehow above the others. It is about the indomitable nature of man, his yearning for freedom, and his obligation to honor, and his love, and the beauty of it all.Jean Renoir is the director, and he is a genius, despite the sloppy beginning. For any movie to be truly great, the director has to be great, because he or she is the one creating everything the audience sees. They craft the actors and the dialogue, interpret the story, even shape the audience's view of characters and their expectations. Renoir is great at that. His panning and focus on what is most important in the story is amazing. So often great directors are too focused on the vision, when in reality, the vision is secondary to storytelling. Vision is most important when the story is particularly challenging or deficient. Otherwise, it's a distraction.

It has its problems (what movies don't) but still, it's enjoyable.When I stumble across someone who asks me why I like Titanic, I suppose my first reaction is wait a minute, you don't? I know so many people who don't like this movie, and I'm not saying I don't see why. The love story is too cheesy well, yes but isn't it enjoyable and moving? All right, the love story between Jack and Rose is very unrealistic, everyone knows that love like this doesn't actually exist. But this is a movie, doesn't everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while? The next complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet are terrible actors. Well, OK, in this movie, I agree that they do not perform to their full potentials. However I think it's unfair to say that they are terrible actors. I personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in. But the roles they are given are simple, and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit, but I agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected.And finally, if one is going to complain that they don't like this movie because they hate romance, or because they hate history, or tragic movies, then I'm sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things.

The Exorcist lacks the thrilling subtlety and possible coincidence of Omen, which is both a key strength and a notable shortcoming. It is a strength because it allows for a more visceral reaction to the violent images as they unfold, but it can also detract from the plausibility of the film if, as I do, the viewer subscribes to a non-Judeo-Christian faith. We know very clearly what really goes on in the film-- this is no psychological torment, it is all real, and too brutal to be convincingly faked.Except, that is, by a team of Hollywood experts like the one assembled to make the film. It may be a supreme irony that the film was released in a year that also saw the G-rated Biblical musicals Godspell and Jesus Christ Superstar, allowing some members of the audience to experience in the same year both the benevolence of Christ and the uninhibited evil of Satan. But one thing is for sure as Godspell and Superstar were classics of re-imagined spirituality, so is Exorcist, but in a totally different way.The main conflict of the film is the demonic possession of a 12-year-old (I'm guessing) girl. Her mother (the excellent Ellen Burstyn) and everyone around loves her, and sees a wonderful purity and goodness in her soul. But when she starts cursing out everything that moves, engaging in violent spasms on her bed, and saying weird, chilling things, something goes terribly wrong.Paying lip service to Occam's razor, mama Burstyn goes looking for the simplest explanation first-- physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, etc.-- but when one suggests exorcism (not out of belief in possession, but as a force of suggestion cure), motherly love convinces her to try the bizarre ritual. Despite the title, there are two exorcists-- the jaded young Father Karras (played perfectly by Jason Miller) and Father Merrin (Max von Sydow-- remember when he played Jesus?), a seasoned veteran in the war against demonic spirits.The actual ritual doesn't occur until at least the last half hour of the movie, but it is one of the most compelling 30-minute sections of film ever captured. With equal twists of the psychological and the supernatural, director William Friedkin turns loose one of the most chilling spectacles of terror ever captured. Even with my beliefs, I still find it hard to go to sleep when scenes from the film creep into my late-night thoughts. That, I think, is a testament to its power as a movie.For those who insist that the film glorifies Satanism, I suggest you watch it and actually pay attention. Does anybody who sees this movie actually *want* to become possessed, or serve the devil?

He is a charlatan who seeks out weak-minded, unstable, gullible minds and exploits them for all they're worth (in dollar value). All of his movies (without exception) are like a con-trick, but such a poorly conceived and unconvincing trick that I cannot for the life of me understand how an adult person with an average intelligence can possible fall for it.If you take this movie seriously you might just be even dumber than Bjork\/Selma. And she is a legend in this category.Watching this train-wreck of a movie made me realize how easily mental illness and directorial incompetence gets mistaken for genius these days, especially in Continental Europe, and particularly among film students (who weren't bright enough to study finance, physics, or anything else that requires functioning thought processes).I can certainly see why a director would want to cast someone with so many face-lifts and such obviously fake lips, Catherine Deneuve, for the part of a FACTORY WORKER. Besides, she is the worst French actress of all time, with a range of emotions going all the way from stone-faced to very stone-faced to apathetic to I'm-so-damn-beautiful-so-why-should-I-even-try. As for Bjork, her miscasting overshadows even Deneuve's. Bad actress or not, Deveuve at least does that for a living, Bjork, however, must have thought she was in a cicrcus; all that her clownish acting needed was a couple of trained seals to catch volleyballs with their noses. Watching this hysterical, infantile pop star play this nonsensical character evoked many hysterically funny moments from Plan 9 and Battlefield Earth.God only knows why Trier has such a fascination with pointless martyrdom, because he utilised the same theme in Breaking The Waves. Selma behaves and reacts like a cross between a dyslexic child, Jesus Christ, a manic-depressive and a psychopath. In other words, the sort of absurd individual that has only ever existed in Trier's rather confused mind. I naively thought that dramas were supposed to have at least a faint connection with the real world...Naturally, in order to justify Bjork's pointless martyrdom, Trier was forced to come up with mindless\/insane characters. He also had to use a plethora of schmaltzy and over-the-top plot-devices that make this movie almost as idiotic as the one I just mentioned - the one in which Emily Watson eked out so many laughs from me. The result is that we end up not with a monumental tragedy but an unintentional comedy. And as if all the preposterous characters and illogical decisions they make weren't enough, Trier felt compelled to add an ingredient that seals this movie's fate as one of the most idiotic ever made musical numbers. They suit this story and setting like a Nobel Peace Price award suits Hitler. Like a baby's socks fit the head of an elephantitis-suffering elephant.The only worthwhile aspects of this mega-t*rd are the soundtrack and Bjork making a total fool of herself. The fact that Cannes's smug, semi-literate jet-set jury gave her an acting award should be a warning to anyone familiar with how all European festivals function Wobbly camera, idiotic characters, moronic plot, America-bashing, forced tragedy, bizarre casting, boring dialogue and just all-out stupid in every other way this must be art.Trier had admitted that he'd never even visited the States, so obviously he's the ideal man to share his expert opinions on that vast and complex land and its people.

Bad actress or not, Deveuve at least does that for a living, Bjork, however, must have thought she was in a cicrcus; all that her clownish acting needed was a couple of trained seals to catch volleyballs with their noses. Watching this hysterical, infantile pop star play this nonsensical character evoked many hysterically funny moments from Plan 9 and Battlefield Earth.God only knows why Trier has such a fascination with pointless martyrdom, because he utilised the same theme in Breaking The Waves. Selma behaves and reacts like a cross between a dyslexic child, Jesus Christ, a manic-depressive and a psychopath. In other words, the sort of absurd individual that has only ever existed in Trier's rather confused mind. I naively thought that dramas were supposed to have at least a faint connection with the real world...Naturally, in order to justify Bjork's pointless martyrdom, Trier was forced to come up with mindless\/insane characters. He also had to use a plethora of schmaltzy and over-the-top plot-devices that make this movie almost as idiotic as the one I just mentioned - the one in which Emily Watson eked out so many laughs from me. The result is that we end up not with a monumental tragedy but an unintentional comedy. And as if all the preposterous characters and illogical decisions they make weren't enough, Trier felt compelled to add an ingredient that seals this movie's fate as one of the most idiotic ever made musical numbers. They suit this story and setting like a Nobel Peace Price award suits Hitler. Like a baby's socks fit the head of an elephantitis-suffering elephant.The only worthwhile aspects of this mega-t*rd are the soundtrack and Bjork making a total fool of herself. The fact that Cannes's smug, semi-literate jet-set jury gave her an acting award should be a warning to anyone familiar with how all European festivals function Wobbly camera, idiotic characters, moronic plot, America-bashing, forced tragedy, bizarre casting, boring dialogue and just all-out stupid in every other way this must be art.Trier had admitted that he'd never even visited the States, so obviously he's the ideal man to share his expert opinions on that vast and complex land and its people.

He is a charlatan who seeks out weak-minded, unstable, gullible minds and exploits them for all they're worth (in dollar value). All of his movies (without exception) are like a con-trick, but such a poorly conceived and unconvincing trick that I cannot for the life of me understand how an adult person with an average intelligence can possible fall for it.If you take this movie seriously you might just be even dumber than Bjork\/Selma. And she is a legend in this category.Watching this train-wreck of a movie made me realize how easily mental illness and directorial incompetence gets mistaken for genius these days, especially in Continental Europe, and particularly among film students (who weren't bright enough to study finance, physics, or anything else that requires functioning thought processes).I can certainly see why a director would want to cast someone with so many face-lifts and such obviously fake lips, Catherine Deneuve, for the part of a FACTORY WORKER. Besides, she is the worst French actress of all time, with a range of emotions going all the way from stone-faced to very stone-faced to apathetic to I'm-so-damn-beautiful-so-why-should-I-even-try.

You can see that kind of thing on a daily basis in any lunatic asylum in any country in the world. Or on MTV's Jackass.The only difference between Divine and countless thousands of nuthouse inmates who ate poo or smeared urine into their ears is that Divine had someone film him do it.If you're into people eating kaka, I suggest you try it yourself. Perhaps there is a latent desire for it, you never know. You might discover a hobby you never knew you wanted.As for me, I feel as though I'd eaten a turd myself, just by having watched this mostly dull garbage. I had to wash my mouth and face, just to be on the safe side. I also had to slap myself on the cheeks a few times, so I wouldn't doze off - but that was during the movie.I have mixed feelings about people who enjoyed this movie. I am torn between pitying them for their cluelessness on one hand, and envying them for their lunacy on the other. I often entertained the thought of becoming a happy loon; they seem to have so much fun, seems like such a blissful happy-go-lucky existence... Alas, becoming a loon is extremely difficult if one isn't genetically programmed for it. You can't force these things.PF isn't a bad movie because it's perverse or disgusting. It's bad simply because it was made by rank amateurs. I've seen plays in schools for the mentally challenged with more emotion, dedication, and preparation. Ask yourself just one thing is it difficult to make something that is base, with the sole purpose to be disgusting and shocking? Making a piece of crap like PF is the easiest kind of movie-making there is. The only easier thing than filming PF would be to not make a movie at all a road John Waters unfortunately never took.And that's why Waters made this kind of film. He had no choice, the poor sap, that's all he CAN do...
