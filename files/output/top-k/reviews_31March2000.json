Because the film has gathered so much appraisal, I'd like to comment on it's drawbacks.First of all, American Beauty's way of treating it's themes is somewhat over-emphasizing and clichéed. I agree with James Berardinelli that the voiceover is completely unnecessary. This is not a children's tale, so we don't need to hear the moral when the story ends. It's far better if we figure it out ourselves. Also, the character played by Wes Bentley (the teenage boy next door) is used in a way which is very typical of American films. He's the wise outsider who sees through everyone and knows everything (see Magnolia for better use of this cliché), and when he says things like there's so much beauty in the world I can't take it or you're not really beautiful, you're ugly he very much serves the same purpose as the voiceover to tell the less intelligent viewer what's going on in this film.Secondly, although the actors do excellent work most of time, they do tend overact; this most evident in the scenes between Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening. This exaggeration is clearly deliberate and though it works most of the time, some scenes just seem to be fishing for cheap laughs.I might have liked American Beauty more, had I not seen two recent films with similar concepts Todd Solondz' Happiness (1998) and Ang Lee's The Ice Storm (1997). Happiness deals with the same themes as American Beauty (the pursuit of happiness amongst middle-aged, middle-class people), but is more insightful and far more daring. The Ice Storm, on the other hand, has a surprisingly similar structure to American Beauty(the two neighboring suburban families, and the relationships between the adults and the teenagers), but it's approach to the subject matter is more subtle and less preachy. For these reasons, both Happiness and The Ice Storm deserve four stars (out of four) and American Beauty only three.

Lester may be a pathetic figure but he is not tragic. After all, he can (he tells us) do whatever he wants. Where is the tragedy in that? His death, of which we are informed just seconds into the film, is not tragic because he tells us at the beginning that he feels dead already. So where's the tragedy when his death finally arrives? Furthermore, where's the comedy? Are we supposed to laugh when he quits his job and starts doing drugs? Stupid maybe, but definitely not funny.And what is the function of the plastic bag swirling in the wind? This scene is supposed to represent beauty. Maybe it is beautiful - who am I to say? - but how does it relate to who the characters are and where they are trying to go? I think the plastic bag is intended to divert viewers' attention away from the shortcomings of the film. We are supposed to think what beauty, how exquisite, not how this image has no relationship with any of the characters. Presumably the roses are used for the same reason. The roses are beautiful, therefore the film must be beautiful. Wrong. The film is beautiful only if the roses are integral to the plot, not just a stylistic device.

It shows on why is it when a man loves a woman, then only to have a woman show up with another man, making the previous man heart-broken.  I know how he feels, there are times when I find that one girl that I find special, then the girl tells me that there's another man in her life, and I always wondered what the girl was doing when I wasn't around her. In the new Stephen Frears, the character of Rob Gordon (John Cusack) is pondering and asking himself on what is wrong with him, where did things go wrong?  Rob just broke up with Laura (Iben Hjejle) and Rob tells Laura that he isn't even hurt, that her break-up didn't even make his top five of his most painful break-ups.  Then Rob tells the viewers his most painful break-ups in the past.  One is the striking beautiful Charlie (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who left Rob for a handsome model.  The other is Sarah (Lili Taylor) who leaves Rob for another friend that she had.  Rob wacks his brain and is searching for the reason on where did he go wrong in life to have these women break up with him. Rob doesn't really get any help from his co-workers at the used record store that he owns.  There's Dick (Todd Louiso) a shy and timid man who is the sensitive man in the story.  Then there is Barry (Jack Black) the wild and arrogant man who only likes to help customers who listen to good music. While at the store, Rob is wondering on why the girls keep leaving him, Barry keeps picking his top five different categories of music.  From top five side 'A' songs to top five death songs. So Rob goes on his own personal trek to find the big mystery on what went wrong with his past relationships. The trouble is that time is running out for Rob, since Laura has just moved in with her neighbor Ian (Tim Robbins), a spirtual yuppie who believes in inner-peace. Well, like every other reviewer, I'm going to give you my top five reasons on why to see HIGH FIDELITY 1.) JOHN CUSACK- he is one of the best actors working in Hollywood today.  He is so energentic and convincing at times that you can understand his frustration.  This is one of Cusack's best films, I would say his top five films are 1.)GRIFTERS  2.)SAY ANYTHING 3.)BEING JOHN MALKOVICH 4.)BETTER OFF DEAD 5.)HIGH FIDELITY  And just like Cusack's character in BETTER OFF DEAD, Lane Myer, he goes through the entire movie thinking about what went wrong. 2.) REALITY OF CHARACTERS- the people portrayed in this film are pretty much the people that you would see on the street.  There is the wild and roudy person like Barry, the quiet and timid Dick, the goddess like person who stands above everyone Charlie, the spritual and inner-seeking self help yuppie Ian, and the sensitive and gentle Laura. 3.) REALITY OF SITUATIONS- the way you see the events happen in this movie seem like it can happen in real life.  Like a man seeking his problems in life, and how many albums can the store sell if they play the music through the store. 4.) SUPPORTING CAST- the supporting cast in the film is great!  Jack Black is funny and wild as Barry, Todd Louiso is also good as the sensitive Dick, Joan Cusack is also enjoyable as Liz, who tries to help Rob, and Iben Hjejle is impressive in her American debut as the girl the Rob wants back. 5.) THE FOCUS ON MUSIC- being the younger brother of a serious music lover, this film does talk about music!  The music topics range from the soul and blues hits from the 60's. The classic hits in the early 70's, the techno pop hits of the 80's like Echo and the Bunnymen and Jesus and Marychain. And the English hit bands of the 90's such as The Beta Band and Stereolab.  I was very pleased to hear and discussion about serious music, instead of music that is only played on hit radio stations, and music that is by a popular artist from the past who is still making new music. I did enjoy HIGH FIDELITY a lot, it's not a laugh a minute comedy like the ads make it out to be.  Word of advice never believe what the ads show you for a movie, you'll either be disappointed or surprised on the movie.  FIDELITY is a good romantic drama with some nice comic bits thrown in.  Like Cusack's other great romantic\/drama SAY ANYTHING, this is a film that will be talked about and mention in years to come. What also surprises me is how did Stephen Frears direct a movie that is so similar to my older brother's life, fascinating. ****1\/2 (out of five)  ","genre":null},{"date":"31 March 2000","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  HIGH FIDELITY is a film that asks the question why? when a relationship breaks up.

This is one of Cusack's best films, I would say his top five films are 1.)GRIFTERS  2.)SAY ANYTHING 3.)BEING JOHN MALKOVICH 4.)BETTER OFF DEAD 5.)HIGH FIDELITY  And just like Cusack's character in BETTER OFF DEAD, Lane Myer, he goes through the entire movie thinking about what went wrong. 2.) REALITY OF CHARACTERS- the people portrayed in this film are pretty much the people that you would see on the street.  There is the wild and roudy person like Barry, the quiet and timid Dick, the goddess like person who stands above everyone Charlie, the spritual and inner-seeking self help yuppie Ian, and the sensitive and gentle Laura. 3.) REALITY OF SITUATIONS- the way you see the events happen in this movie seem like it can happen in real life.  Like a man seeking his problems in life, and how many albums can the store sell if they play the music through the store. 4.) SUPPORTING CAST- the supporting cast in the film is great!  Jack Black is funny and wild as Barry, Todd Louiso is also good as the sensitive Dick, Joan Cusack is also enjoyable as Liz, who tries to help Rob, and Iben Hjejle is impressive in her American debut as the girl the Rob wants back. 5.) THE FOCUS ON MUSIC- being the younger brother of a serious music lover, this film does talk about music!  The music topics range from the soul and blues hits from the 60's. The classic hits in the early 70's, the techno pop hits of the 80's like Echo and the Bunnymen and Jesus and Marychain. And the English hit bands of the 90's such as The Beta Band and Stereolab.  I was very pleased to hear and discussion about serious music, instead of music that is only played on hit radio stations, and music that is by a popular artist from the past who is still making new music. I did enjoy HIGH FIDELITY a lot, it's not a laugh a minute comedy like the ads make it out to be.  Word of advice never believe what the ads show you for a movie, you'll either be disappointed or surprised on the movie.  FIDELITY is a good romantic drama with some nice comic bits thrown in.  Like Cusack's other great romantic\/drama SAY ANYTHING, this is a film that will be talked about and mention in years to come. What also surprises me is how did Stephen Frears direct a movie that is so similar to my older brother's life, fascinating. ****1\/2 (out of five)  ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music"},{"date":"31 March 2000","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  This film was quite good. The acting was top-notched. Terence Stamp was excellent. Apparently, the real-life limeys thought that his Cockney accent wasn't good, but it wasn't grating. I thought that he perfectly expressed emotion. He played an extremely complex character. I felt a genuine sense of pathos for him. Even better was Peter Fonda. I think this role of his was the best I've ever seen, better than Ulee's Gold or Easy Rider (which wasn't really an actor's movie, so don't crucify me for that comment). He was certainly not the standard Hollywood scumbag producer whom we see in a lot of movies which take place in that place. He was actually kind of likeable. Though he had done plenty of bad things, he seemed to have been trying make amends with his past. Notice how he acts around his girlfriend. When I saw her, I thought, Oh boy, another Hollywood fantasy where an aging man sleeps with an extremely young girl. But it was never like that. Fonda seemed to really care about her, as if he were trying to right the wrong that he did to Jennifer. And his girlfriend did not seem empty-headed. She was kind. She was genuinely interested in her lover's past. It was not as if she was just there for the money. But the crazy jump shots and weird editing really took away from the film. In fact, it was so annoying that I gave this film an 8 instead of the 10 it should have been. I liked the way the director narrated some of the background information over Wilson's journey to the place of illegal business to which Eddie drove Jennifer. There is this sort of editing, and it leads into a quick burst of  carefully directed violence. Very effective. What I disliked was the way there would be a shot of a character standing there with his mouth shut while the same person would be speaking in a voice-over. Now that was grating! The flashbacks were sort of hackneyed, also. Many, many movies show flashbacks in a blurry or grainy film stock.This editing was so distracting, that I bet a lot of people will hate it just for that. It takes away from the great story and acting. Without that editing, it would have been better than Out of Sight.

Costello always gets taken advantage of because he is often too naive and trusting to know better, and for that I cannot help but adore him. Bud Abbott is also hilarious against Lou Costello, and is always hilariously angry at him.As of now, I have seen only three of their films and will very shortly watch a fourth, and I DO NOT think that comedies are funny for a certain period of time and then get unfunnier. Some of the films I saw (particularly In the Navy but not this one) would sink if it weren't for Abbott and Costello starring in them. Abbott and Costello are much more talented than most actors, and tend to have more screen presence. My advice If you cannot always enjoy Abbott and Costello consistently, you're a hopeless case.

Others such as the poor woman who Kevin makes friends with and the hotel clerk played by Tim Curry(who also plays Rooster in the musical, Annie) are first introduced in the series.  This movie had tons of humor and suspense.  One part I liked was where Kevin played a gangster video in his room and some of the staff came over.  They were standing out of Kevin's hotel room and thought there really was a man in there.  The gangster says I'll forgive you if you bend down on your knees and say you love me!  The staff bent down and said I love you! The gangster in the movie shot at a woman and the staff thought he was really shooting at someone in the hotel room.  I haven't forgotten about Marv and Harry.  Seeing those two get into all sorts of new (and more violent) booby traps was okay, but it got to be quite painful-looking.  For example, when Marv falls through a hole and lands on the hard cement floor, he turns out to just have minor pains.  In reality of course, that would've killed him.

Mr. Sinise is one of my favorite actors, and I was quite saddened to see him looking like he hadn't gotten enough sleep and robotically reciting his lines.

True, a powerful performance was given by all characters in the film, some roles more than others, but after sitting through 2 of the 3 hours of the movie, I was growing listless and wanting to leave. The movie just had too many things going on at once, too many small to medium size sub-plots all moving at the same time in different directions. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie as a whole, from the fresh new characters and their struggle to the comic relief of Wild Bill Wharton. Darabont successfully re-creates the dark and brooding atmosphere that was the standard in prisons of that time, although I feel that this movie was a letdown compared to Shawshank.In wanting to get more from the movie, I took the liberty of buying the six book set of The Green Mile, by Stephen King. Of all the movies I have seen and owned in my 20 years, this one follows the book series almost to the letter. After reading the books, I went and saw the movie again, and got a lot more from it this time.

This is where Shawshank edged this movie. We could all relate to Andy Dufresqne, his struggles, because he was a realistic person, in a very real (but re-created) environment. We could hear and appreciate the playing of the opera over the loudspeaker because Darabont did a super job of putting us there.

Instead, this is an intellectual film about the relationship between the viewer and the filmmaker. Anyone who knows Polanski, and for that matter many of our best filmmakers, knows he wonders about what it means to make a real movie, one that works as art. Which is to say it does more than amaze and entertain.This movie is to Polanski as &#147;The Name of the Rose&#148; was to Umberto Eco. That was a book about what books aren&#146;t. This is a movie about what movies aren&#146;t.Caution, spoilers ahead!The story is frail -- that&#146;s the point, in fact a little too obvious for my taste. The book in question has been poured over for over 300 years, with everyone focused on the text. And that text is completely irrelevant, disposable, just as the story of the film is. The whole point of the film is in its images, the story is deliberately degraded to make the point. (The images are great Polanksi working in partnership with LCR?)It&#146;s all about abstraction. How could viewers not catch the layers of the inferno\/hosts of angels references?--at the bottom level, you have the Frenchman who owns the book but isn't interested except for the beauty of the binding--then you have the Baroness who has spent her life writing about the devil and never even considering the pictures, even though she had the best clue--she SAW him.--at a higher level, you have Liana Tefler, who knows there&#146;s some power in the artifact but is still focused on the text (and incidentally sex)--higher still you have Balkan who knows the text is worthless, and the pictures the real value but thinks the magic is in the pictures--then you have the two brothers who have the power to tinker with the power of the pictures--finally Corso who we see moving from the bottom of the list to this layer where he knows the power is not in the pictures themselves, but in the quest. (At the beginning, the value of the book to him is neither in its text, nor pictures, but in its binding and rarity.)--then we have &#147;the girl&#148; who IS the pictures--and we have the viewer.This is a cross, four people stacked, the two brothers and then three more people stacked -- A layering actually used in early 17th century tracts on the nature of abstraction, which in retrospect are called occult. In fact it is the same layering of semiotics outlined by Eco, and much earlier used in the apprentice novels of Goethe (including Faust, which this story quotes).That&#146;s nine players, eight levels of consciousness created by the filmmaker, each layer tossing aside something.
