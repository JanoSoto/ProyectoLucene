That's it, other than that I have mostly criticism if you're interested*Spoilers*1. The story was dragging along in an awfully slow pace.2. There was not actually much happening in the movie.3. There was a lot going on that didn't really give this movie any more substance4. The constant talk about There is no coincidence started to really get irritating, and the sentences Swing away and His lungs were closed really drove this to the edge of utter irritation. Because if that was to be the movies main point, then it was a really boring one!5. Whenever there was action to be expected you saw it from an angle from which you actually saw the least! In the cellar you saw 20 seconds of flashlight on dirty ground whilst the guys struggled to free the boy, -22345 points for that. Mostly in the fighting scene in the living room, you saw the bat, not the beaten one, -362344 points for that.6. In general did this movie have about the worst shots I've ever seen! I think the film makers didn't wanna waste time on cutting up scenes into smaller 2 second bits like it usually would be done in many places, so when Mel Gibson talked to the woman who was playing his wife, you end up seeing him first for about 10 seconds and THEN FINALLY when you think you're never going to see her face, the camera switches angles and shows her face too. There were very many shots like that where not only the camera angles were extremely irritating but also what was filmed did not always seem to be the best choice. Whoever made the screenplay for this movie or decided what to shoot should really go back to film school! I could really and honestly have done that better myself!7. Did you too notice that it seems as if we viewers were supposed to see as little of the aliens as possible? The first one is locked in a room and all you see is his fingers. The next bunch is again not in the same room as the camera and the rest of the people and when finally that single alien was in the middle of the room, the room had somehow become very dark - at least where the alien was standing - eventho it had actually been quite bright a minute before when the boy was on the couch next to where the alien now stood. It really seemed to me as if we were only to know that there were aliens, but we were not supposed to see them! CHEAP!8. I found the story one of the most boring they could have made out of that topic. I would have rather seen this movie take some kind of direction a bit like Contact did. Maybe that Gibson was a scientist investigating crop circles who had started to kind of figure out some meaning and then maybe would have made one of his own that made sense to the aliens and that way gotten in contact with them... or anything else, but not a priest who doesn't wanna be a priest who has children which run around with aluminium foil hats all day and a brother who cant play baseball and a wife who died and said some delirious things when she passed away... TIRESOME AND DISAPPOINTING!9. Of course this wasn't really illogical, but common... people in the Middle East being the ones to discover that the aliens don't like water? I mean... is that the first thing people in the Middle East would do? Spray water on aliens? As I said, it's not unlikely and I know that there too is water in the Middle East, but I would have found it a bit more likely for somebody else to come up with that, maybe people from South America or anything like that. Well well... this was just another of those more odd things that don't make you wanna watch this movie again.Move along folks! Nothing to see here!!

While Donnie puts his life at risk, his real life crumbles as he never sees his wife or children.  As he moves upwards, his friend Lefty is bypassed time and time again.  As Donnie gets deeper, the FBI start to worry and want to extract him - something that cannot be done without exposing himself and condemning Lefty to death.Now that Pirates of the Caribean has made him a bankable star as well as a good actor I decided to dig out some of my old Depp videos and watch them. I have been a Depp fan since the mid-90's when I saw Arizona Dream, Ed Wood and Don Juan all in a period of 6 months -I realised then that this was not only a very talented guy but also one who seemed happy to do whatever interested him rather than whatever was going to make money.  This film is in a well known and fairly reliable genre - the Italian American gangster movie but has the strength that it is an engaging true story.  The plot follows Joe as he gets in deeper, is suspected, gets involved in battles between bosses and eventually starts to lose himself and forget what side he is actually on.  Even though this is a true story, it still basically goes where we expect mob films to go, but it manages to rise above the clichés by having some very good characters and emotional themes.The whole gangster thing works and is gripping, but it is the relationship dynamics between Joe and Lefty that made it more interesting.  The element of going `native' when undercover has been done plenty of times, but it is the combination of this being fact and Depp's great performance that makes it work well here; we feel for Joe a great deal.  On the flipside the film also allows us to feel for the mob, or at least one of them.  The majority of the mobsters are the usual stereotypes but Lefty is written with a great deal of sympathy - he is a middleman, taking the risks, doing the dirt but always passed over and having to beg money to keep his bosses happy. These are tragic characters and the film is not the slightly glamorous gangster lifestyle that Pacino has experienced in his Godfather roles.  These two characters are well written and it is their subplots that makes the film better than the central plot (which itself is also very good).Depp is good and his performance is solid even if it doesn't really rank up their with his best - he lacks his usual flair but he gives the material it's dues.  Pacino is of course, wonderful.  His character is a far cry from his Godfather work and he manages to bring such pathos to Lefty that it is impossible not to feel for him.  The support cast may not have as much in the way of character but they all do well in their roles.  Madsen, Kirby, Ivanek, Heche, Miano and others all give good support, but it is Pacino and Depp's film - which is a good thing.Overall, the fact that this is a true story makes it more interesting but, while I was watching it I wasn't really thinking about it and was just enjoying the gangster film itself.  The basic story is a well worn one but is still delivery well by Newell (who was a very unusual choice for director), but it is the emotion threads involving Joe and Lefty that make the film much more than just another gangster film.

Sonny, Sal and another man walk into the bank and hold it up.  Seconds into the job, the third man changes his mind and leaves. The job starts to go wrong when Sonny discovers that the truck he was told was dropping off money, was actually picking it up, meaning the vault is nearly empty.  Things get worse when the police arrive outside and trap the two inside with a handful of hostages.  As Sonny and Sal try to keep control, a circus breaks out on the street with the police, the public and the media all involved.I have seen this film several times but it has been a few years since I last had the chance to see it.  I watched it again today with the memory of it being good but not really as truly great as many seem to think it is.  The plot is all the more fascinated for it being true but it is not an easy subject to bring to the screen.  While morally most people can accept robbers in films as characters to support, it is a bigger step to accept the sexualities and complexities of these characters and to get behind them. However the film actually manages to make this quite moving and difficult - not only do we feel for Sonny but the film is fair to him and, more impressively, Leon. It would have been easy to turn this relationship into a joke but the script allows it to be done with sensitivity.  The rest of the film captures the sense of circus and media feeding frenzy well as well as being quite tense and enjoyable to watch.The film's strength is it's performances and, in particular, Pacino in a performance that is both showy and understated at different times.  He is a real person and it is to his credit that, no matter the revelations about Sonny, he never loses the audience.  Cazale is good here too but in a different way - a simple, sympathetic character.  His hit rate is amazing when you think that he was only ever in a handful of films and they were all pretty amazing, but it's hard to tell how good an actor he was really. Durning is good in support and the rest of the cast are pretty good but it is Pacino's film and he manages well with the shouting, the silence and the complexities of his characters.Overall this is not one of the best films ever made but it is certainly a very good telling of this true story.  The film deals very well with both the tension of the situation but also the underlying stories and characters - even more surprising for the period it was made in, it makes a very balanced presentation of the homosexual characters.

De Niro plays Lorenzo, a bus driver from the Bronx who works hard for a living and is perfectly content with his low amount of income, if only because it is clean. When he is offered a small Mafia job, he turns it down. The local Mafia kingpin is Sonny (Chazz Palminteri). As I grew in age, he grew in power, says young Calogero, a.k.a. C, a.k.a. Lorenzo's son. In the beginning of the film, nine-year-old C witnesses a murder at the hands of Sonny, but doesn't rat on the man. Soon he is taken under the wing of the gangster, being thrust into the middle of gambling rackets and running errands of sorts. Lorenzo despises the Mafia and pleads with Sonny to leave his son alone. They didn't speak ever again, says C, now seventeen years old (played by Lillo Brancato) and narrating the story. In a way, C suddenly has two fathers -- Lorenzo, who gives him good advice; and Sonny, whose advice is often times witty but not always the right thing. C is a confused kid, unsure of what to do with his life, hanging out with the wrong crowds. De Niro's performance as Lorenzo is the most touching in the film, because it is so true, and he displays the same caring side of all parents who want to give their kids good advice.One of the movie's only flaws is the stereotypical love interest subplot, this time between C and a sixteen-year-old black girl who goes to his school. C is the only kid on his block who doesn't want to take part in racist beatings and he is apparently the only one, at the time, who isn't bothered with the blacks' presence on the street. What is so disappointing about this rather unnecessary addition to the plot is that it feels tacky, one of the only unrealistic moments in an otherwise grandiose motion picture. C steps over the boundaries of being a respectable character, brought up by a very wise father, to a downright stereotypical Good Guy, who appreciates the minority figures and is the lone voice in a large crowd of haters. I'm not saying that C shouldn't fall in love with a black girl, but the entire subplot is entirely out of place, unnecessary, unbelievable (there is absolutely no chemistry between the two actors) and, to be blunt, silly. Silly, and a major error on De Niro's part, because it tries to manipulate its audience and turn C into an unrealistic, open-minded guy -- the sort of character who would have never existed back then, especially under the influence he grew up in.Oh well. The movie is still brilliant, almost perfect, aside from that superfluous subplot.The film was written by Palminteri, based on his own one-man play from 1989. As Sonny, Palminteri proves that he can exhibit the same sort of oozing confidence that De Niro displayed as Jimmy in Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas, the best mob movie ever made, which bears a few resemblances to A Bronx Tale. De Niro claims that in order to separate his film from others that have already dealt with the same sort of backdrop, he studied his own movies -- particularly those directed by Scorsese -- and tried to stray away from many techniques and ideas used in those movies. What De Niro delivers is an occasionally funny, occasionally painful, coming-of-age drama with guts. De Niro is right these sorts of films have been made before, but in his directorial debut, De Niro proves that he isn't just one of the greatest actors of all time, but a gifted director with a stunning vision. De Niro's love and respect for New York City shines through in A Bronx Tale, just about as much as his very obvious attention to detail and characters.

It is true there is a murder, and that is where similarities to usual murder mysteries ends.  However, Hollywood chose to market this as some sort of P.G.

It is not just an attack on the British class system, or even on class systems in general, but it is also about the hierarchies and judgments all of us constantly make, everyday.  The servants in the movie maintain every bit of the level of gossiping and social hierarchy of the folks upstairs.  True, the class system and terrible treatment of single mothers at the time ultimately leads to the murder, yet the servants are not free of prejudice, either.This is by far one of Altman's most subtle and powerful films.

But that is Altman's point, too; our own lives are certainly not neatly folded into plots and subplots that are resolved neatly after two hours, but rather half-remembered conversations, small yet telling gestures or glances, and powerful, truthful moments, such as when one the maids abruptly says that all she really seeks is true love. (Okay, sounds hokey here, but, really, it's a remarkable scene.)  The murdered person in Gosford Park stirs up even more emotions and life-changing moments after he is dead.

When Archer is murdered and Thursby gunned down, the police and Spade are keen to get answers. When the woman reveals she was lying about her motivations and her identity (she is really Bridget O'Shaughnessy), Sam finds out that she and Thursby were hiding a valuable statute of a falcon. The situation gets more complex when Bridget and Sam come under pressure form other sources that also want the falcon for themselves - namely the pompous Kasper Gutman and the weasely Joel Cairo.The fact that this film is considered a classic almost makes it difficult to come to this with an objective view, but I did the best I could when I came to see it again for the first time in quite a few years. The film is pretty much a classic that deserves it reputation and stands out as a great bit of hardboiled detective stories from the period. The plot is a little complex at the start as the characters are introduced, but it quickly settles down to be a film with a solid plot that is enjoyable despite the fact that it falls down occasionally. The plot details are too often blurred or just forgotten about - giving the impression of a plot that is more complex than it actually is. However this isn't a problem as the film has enough pace and tough energy to cover these weaknesses and never let you linger for very long on them. The direction from Huston is very good, using almost totally interior shots to increase the tension and the feeling - amazingly this was his first film as director, but you wouldn't know it to watch it. Of course, needless to say, the writing (both source and screenplay) is top notch and is one of the big selling points of the film.The dialogue is really tough and full of memorable lines, 'When you're slapped you'll take it and like it' probably being the one that everybody remembers. A big reason that the dialogue works as well as it does is down to the fantastic performances from all the cast, although having said that it is dominated by the lead. Bogart summed up his most famous roles for future generations in this one film. He is a complex guy who we're never sure is straight of crooked, he is tough and violent - sleeping with his partner's wife and unafraid of anything. The dialogue fits him like a glove and this is one of my favourite of his performances as it is the one of the ones where he seems to have got everything bang on. Astor is good because, for me, she doesn't fit into the usual role of femme fatale - she is quite needy and demur and that is even more dangerous than the women who are overtly sexual and manipulative, as they were frequently in the later noirs. Lorre is the wonderful, weedy, snivelling character than he does so well and is remembered for. Likewise Greenstreet is a great actor and manages to be overblown without being silly. Cook has a small role but shows his talents in little ways - his reaction when he realises how expendable he is to Gutman is great.Overall this is a classic film that will please all fans of detective stories and the noir genre. It has a flawed plot but it's dialogue and tough energy cover those up enough to keep things moving all the time. The characters are complex, none more so than Spade himself who is as smart as he is gullible and as cold as he is loving , and they are brought to life by a series of great performances. On top of all this, the film is dominated by a Bogart performance that acts as a perfect example of his most famous work.

This is a complaint that is a consistent reminder of the fickle movie-going public. This is the first of this review's ironic findings. That when a sequel is considered a rehash of the last film then it is unworthy. And yet when a sequel, such as Alien3, is different we simply turn our noses upwards at it. Basically, it seems the major complaint here is that Alien3 is NOT Aliens. In particular many Aliens fan whine at Fincher's apparent responsibility in killing off Hick's and Newt before the film has even begun. To which I can find no more an appropriate word than 'Boo-hoo'.These people call themselves fans of the Alien Saga and yet do not seem to recognize the basic fact that they all play on our emotional investments as an Audience. From Scott to Jeunet, all of the directors register the 'Freudian Nightmare' aspect of both the alien lifecycle and saga, and Fincher is no exception. All the previous films both begin with awakening and end with returning to hypersleep, coincidence? It is this careful underpinning in the series as a whole that Alien3 and Fincher so successfully shifts to the audience's horror. Ripley, having previously and successfully faced the entire swarm of alien brethren is still unable to escape her fate, being ultimately and irrevocably entangled with that of the aliens. These simple-minded action lovers complain at the film's relentless downbeat tone and sizeable lack of weaponry and action, yet it is something Fincher should be appraised for having such courage to do. These people dare to refer to the previous two as simple.Ask yourself what could be worse than having had the comfort and hope of friendship and love restored, having already once lost everything you knew, and then so harshly torn away from you again? Ripley is absolutely alone, and what is worse is she is doomed from the start, an alien queen is now inside her. She is the harbinger of all the convicts' death (except Morse). This is what I find so thought provoking and, in the end, moving about Alien3. This is a wonderfully original spin on the format of the first; the alien is now more willing to protect Ripley then guzzle her up for lunch. And so does she sacrifice herself in an attempt to right the wrongs. Why do you people complain at so beautiful and righteous a send off for the now legendary anti-corporate symbol that Lt. Ripley has become?The second irony is also the most aggravating to think about, the 'company' themselves. Fox. Brandywine, the small production company that made its debut with Alien had, by the post-production (or the editing phase) of the filmmaking process on Alien3, effectively relinquished controls to 20th Century Fox Film Corporation. The executives there disallowed our valiant director, David Fincher, the rights every director needs to complete their feature. It has even been said that Fincher was locked out completely from the editing process after his initial 'three-hour' assembly cut was dubbed by the ignorant test-screenee's to have too many bald English people in it.I find it no wonder that Fincher has since disowned the film. Now what I really should say here is project; despite being a fan of both the original and 'special edition', what I find is that the so-called special edition is exactly what the DVD claims it to be an Assembly Cut (or a rough projection of the film). And it seems to me that original is simply a shortened assembly cut, neither is well and truly what Fincher had envisioned, one has simply creeped closer.No matter how brilliant a director Fincher was on set during production, all he does could amount to Barbarella if it isn't edited with the care and attention that expert Terry Rawlings (Alien) tried to allow it. But he also was stomped on his way by the self-defeating fat cats at Fox.Alien3, from the standpoint of the keener brained filmgoer, is a brilliantly textured film from Elliot Goldenthal's deep and wonderful score to the astounding cinematography of Alex Thomson and Norman Reynolds's immaculate production design. Alien3 looks and sounds fantastic, it fits right in the series. With the Weyland-Yutani logo, the rusted, used and abused look and fabulous compound of design styles. But, honestly, what good is a beautiful tapestry in a narrative medium? Fox greenlighted the project with a script for an almost entirely different project that only has echoes in the film as it stands today.As Fincher was pulled onto the project there was no script and no shooting schedule - even the sets were built before there was a completed script. Fox believed that, as a debut director, they could simply push him around, what they found was quite the opposite. And so alot of the films seems rather like a push and pull game with what he could and could not do. This being said, there are certain aspects of the story (or plot holes) that are fundamentally flawed that were there before Fincher was. We are expected to believe without explanation that in her brief spell on the Sulaco the Queen planted two eggs which were then unnoticed, and then that a single spider alien caused a fire so devastating that it created the need for the evacuation of the entire crew. This simply is unavoidable. It is one of the major flaws of the finished film.Another point I might make is, I believe, again due to the suffering of the editing process. The Alien has now become somewhat mindless - killing and feeding randomly and almost constantly where before it was a terrible and on a freudian level a disturbingly erotic menace. It is now an awful puppet too. All the on set effects are fantastic, but there are unfortunately so many shots of this awful blob of a dog\/ox type alien running rather spastically. It's out of proportion and the lighting doesn't match - it's just generally awful. I accept however that it was basically impossible at the time to have the alien convincingly run on all fours on set and that as a fan of science fiction, film and drama I should be able to suspend my disbelief. However it does rather ruin the atmosphere.And so as Fox had finished shooting their own feet, I am brought to my final irony Alien3 was received badly upon release in one country alone, the USA. Everywhere else it sold very well and generally made Fox alot of money. I believe this speaks for itself.And so in conclusion, I find it very hard to evaluate Alien3 as it is a film I adore and yet take with a pinch of salt in equal measure. It is such a contradiction. So beautiful and thought provoking; the performances are exceptional as is the characterisation and most of the dialogue, it features a heart-wrenchingly beautiful score, it looks fantastic and is courageously pitiless in its assault of the audience's emotional baggage. And yet it is not scary, despite being atmospheric and eerie, the plot holes can be hard to look past and is generally rough around the edges. However it sits rather perfectly at the end of what would have been a trilogy. It has a host of interesting philosophical themes; isolation, redemption and sacrifice. As well as resurfacing old ones like dissatisfaction at the brave new universe and certain aspects of the xenomorph lifestyle. However it has none of the freudian eroticism (beyond Giger's alien-penis-head) that really makes the first one for me. So in the end, all I can say is I recommend this yet-to-be-completed project but always with a caution. Ultimately I am unable to rate it due to the large inconsistencies between the good and the bad.Still this film haunts my mind's eye - the furnace goes out - this represents Ripley's death (a reference to Citizen Kane) - the sweeping score.

To which I can find no more an appropriate word than 'Boo-hoo'.These people call themselves fans of the Alien Saga and yet do not seem to recognize the basic fact that they all play on our emotional investments as an Audience. From Scott to Jeunet, all of the directors register the 'Freudian Nightmare' aspect of both the alien lifecycle and saga, and Fincher is no exception. All the previous films both begin with awakening and end with returning to hypersleep, coincidence? It is this careful underpinning in the series as a whole that Alien3 and Fincher so successfully shifts to the audience's horror. Ripley, having previously and successfully faced the entire swarm of alien brethren is still unable to escape her fate, being ultimately and irrevocably entangled with that of the aliens. These simple-minded action lovers complain at the film's relentless downbeat tone and sizeable lack of weaponry and action, yet it is something Fincher should be appraised for having such courage to do. These people dare to refer to the previous two as simple.Ask yourself what could be worse than having had the comfort and hope of friendship and love restored, having already once lost everything you knew, and then so harshly torn away from you again? Ripley is absolutely alone, and what is worse is she is doomed from the start, an alien queen is now inside her. She is the harbinger of all the convicts' death (except Morse). This is what I find so thought provoking and, in the end, moving about Alien3. This is a wonderfully original spin on the format of the first; the alien is now more willing to protect Ripley then guzzle her up for lunch. And so does she sacrifice herself in an attempt to right the wrongs. Why do you people complain at so beautiful and righteous a send off for the now legendary anti-corporate symbol that Lt. Ripley has become?The second irony is also the most aggravating to think about, the 'company' themselves. Fox. Brandywine, the small production company that made its debut with Alien had, by the post-production (or the editing phase) of the filmmaking process on Alien3, effectively relinquished controls to 20th Century Fox Film Corporation. The executives there disallowed our valiant director, David Fincher, the rights every director needs to complete their feature. It has even been said that Fincher was locked out completely from the editing process after his initial 'three-hour' assembly cut was dubbed by the ignorant test-screenee's to have too many bald English people in it.I find it no wonder that Fincher has since disowned the film. Now what I really should say here is project; despite being a fan of both the original and 'special edition', what I find is that the so-called special edition is exactly what the DVD claims it to be an Assembly Cut (or a rough projection of the film). And it seems to me that original is simply a shortened assembly cut, neither is well and truly what Fincher had envisioned, one has simply creeped closer.No matter how brilliant a director Fincher was on set during production, all he does could amount to Barbarella if it isn't edited with the care and attention that expert Terry Rawlings (Alien) tried to allow it. But he also was stomped on his way by the self-defeating fat cats at Fox.Alien3, from the standpoint of the keener brained filmgoer, is a brilliantly textured film from Elliot Goldenthal's deep and wonderful score to the astounding cinematography of Alex Thomson and Norman Reynolds's immaculate production design. Alien3 looks and sounds fantastic, it fits right in the series. With the Weyland-Yutani logo, the rusted, used and abused look and fabulous compound of design styles. But, honestly, what good is a beautiful tapestry in a narrative medium? Fox greenlighted the project with a script for an almost entirely different project that only has echoes in the film as it stands today.As Fincher was pulled onto the project there was no script and no shooting schedule - even the sets were built before there was a completed script. Fox believed that, as a debut director, they could simply push him around, what they found was quite the opposite. And so alot of the films seems rather like a push and pull game with what he could and could not do. This being said, there are certain aspects of the story (or plot holes) that are fundamentally flawed that were there before Fincher was. We are expected to believe without explanation that in her brief spell on the Sulaco the Queen planted two eggs which were then unnoticed, and then that a single spider alien caused a fire so devastating that it created the need for the evacuation of the entire crew. This simply is unavoidable. It is one of the major flaws of the finished film.Another point I might make is, I believe, again due to the suffering of the editing process. The Alien has now become somewhat mindless - killing and feeding randomly and almost constantly where before it was a terrible and on a freudian level a disturbingly erotic menace. It is now an awful puppet too. All the on set effects are fantastic, but there are unfortunately so many shots of this awful blob of a dog\/ox type alien running rather spastically. It's out of proportion and the lighting doesn't match - it's just generally awful. I accept however that it was basically impossible at the time to have the alien convincingly run on all fours on set and that as a fan of science fiction, film and drama I should be able to suspend my disbelief. However it does rather ruin the atmosphere.And so as Fox had finished shooting their own feet, I am brought to my final irony Alien3 was received badly upon release in one country alone, the USA. Everywhere else it sold very well and generally made Fox alot of money. I believe this speaks for itself.And so in conclusion, I find it very hard to evaluate Alien3 as it is a film I adore and yet take with a pinch of salt in equal measure. It is such a contradiction. So beautiful and thought provoking; the performances are exceptional as is the characterisation and most of the dialogue, it features a heart-wrenchingly beautiful score, it looks fantastic and is courageously pitiless in its assault of the audience's emotional baggage. And yet it is not scary, despite being atmospheric and eerie, the plot holes can be hard to look past and is generally rough around the edges. However it sits rather perfectly at the end of what would have been a trilogy. It has a host of interesting philosophical themes; isolation, redemption and sacrifice. As well as resurfacing old ones like dissatisfaction at the brave new universe and certain aspects of the xenomorph lifestyle. However it has none of the freudian eroticism (beyond Giger's alien-penis-head) that really makes the first one for me. So in the end, all I can say is I recommend this yet-to-be-completed project but always with a caution. Ultimately I am unable to rate it due to the large inconsistencies between the good and the bad.Still this film haunts my mind's eye - the furnace goes out - this represents Ripley's death (a reference to Citizen Kane) - the sweeping score. I will shut up now.

Upon arriving in England it is discovered that all of the ship's crew have been murdered and only a raving lunatic of a Renfield remain alive.

The rather bizarre decision was taken to ignore all the other Godzilla films before except the very first one,and have this one as a direct sequel to that film. More commendably,it was decided to return to a more serious style and have Godzilla as a menace again. Therefore there is no wrestling with other monsters or such like,this is as much a remake of the original as well as a sequel.Sadly,the film is still somewhat disappointing. The pace is extremely slow,and while this was fine in the original due to the dark,brooding atmosphere of that film and the fact the fact that it's human characters were interesting,here,there is little atmosphere and the humans are boring. This is one Godzilla film that could actually be called dull at times. Scenes of people sitting down and talking sometimes go on forever,although the political dimension does give the film a little depth. Effects are generally good,the new suit is impressive except for the ping-pong eyes,and there are a few great action scenes,such as a battle between Godzilla and the 'Super X'machine with both of them on either side of a skysraper. However we are sadly denied a big destruction sequence like in the original,and Godzilla is vanquished in the most pathetic way imaginable,although there is a touch of poignance in the last scene.The US version is a mixed bag. Having Raymond Burr return was a good idea,but he has nothing to do. The pace was quickened,but the political aspect was crudely simplified such as having the Russians fire a missile on purpose rather than by mistake,some scenes were oddly edited,and the less said about the Dr Pepper plugs the better. It's certainly not a great Godzilla film,but it deserved better treatment.

Therefore there is no wrestling with other monsters or such like,this is as much a remake of the original as well as a sequel.Sadly,the film is still somewhat disappointing.

It's so unbelievable that it still makes me laugh with delight...  like I did when I first saw it at the age of 13.The fact that such a high-class movie kept a hyper 13-year-old happy is in itself pretty impressive.  Even more so is that, ten years later, it still entertains and delights me.All in all, I must note that this film rates the highest, and as soon as I can, I'm picking it up in wide-screen DVD.
