No expectations of compelling storytelling, no expectations of plausible plot development, no expectations of oscar-winning voice-overs.Accordingly, I was very pleased with what this movie delivered. The Squaresoft animators from Hawai'i did a terrific job assembling this animation marvel.Firstly, this movie is absolutely BEAUTIFUL looking!  The animation is groundbreaking, and the attention to detail goes down to the degree of pores in the characters' skin.  Outside of some rigidity in the characters' mouth motions, the motion and texture of Final Fantasy is better even than the formidable Reboot and Beast Wars animation.Secondly, the epic shoot-em-up action is on the scale of a James Cameron science fiction film... plenty of gunfire and creepy-crawlies to please all the action fans out there. Plenty of high-tech gadgets and ships to please the SF fans, too.Thirdly, I was delighted to have a female protagonist do some a**-kicking as a bright and educated character.  We could certainly use more powerful female role models in modern moviemaking.I was disappointed with the hoakey science of this movie, however.  It had a flaky Akira nonsense about it.  Scientists and educated viewers might shake their heads and tune out at the pseudo-science explanation of the ethereal phantom antagonists.BUT, if you can get past the implausible part of the plot, then this is truly an eye-candy experience for action and animation fans.I highly recommend Final Fantasy as a rental.Now... if we could only get Spielberg to partner with the F.F.

I still think it's a masterpiece, however now it fills the second place in my preferences and the first one belongs to Lord Laurence Olivier. To begin with, I was astonished to find out that scenery, costumes and make-up in Kozintsev's film clearly resemble those from Olivier's version. No doubts, our producer knew and appreciated earlier English movie and deliberately copied the settings. Well, I don't blame him he used it successfully, but the lack of originality is somehow disappointing.  The scenery is really wonderful cold, gloomy, dark, gothic, haunting and even more impressive for being black-and-white. And then&#133; LORD LAURENCE OLIVIER IS THE BEST SHAKESPEAREAN ACTOR EVER. No one else can make the 16th century Bard's text sound modern, natural, alive, expressive, exciting, clear and full of hidden before meaning. Indeed, soviet actors pronounce the text fantastically well, but in Russian I mean in translation by talented Russian poet Pasternak. And recently I've become interested in reading and watching Shakespeare in original. And here Olivier is an unparalleled performer. He portraits his hero wonderfully. His Hamlet is dignified and noble, reserved and mistrustful, emotional and ruthless (when he knows it is justified), and deeply frustrated (for he is disappointed in everyone except the foreigner Horatio). He is willing to act and yet waits to understand what's happening better. However events take an unexpected course and lead to the final tragedy. At the beginning Hamlet is called `a man who couldn't make up his mind'. Well, I would choose other words `a man who changed his mind too often', but it wasn't his fault &#150; so were circumstances. And Olivier presents these changes very vividly and truthfully. He makes `To be or not to be' an unusually powerful scene showing Hamlet just a man who sees so much evil all around that he nearly commits suicide. He is stopped only by sudden understanding that death is unremediable and too frightening &#150; natural thought for any sensible man, brave as he is. Such simple variant pleases me better than more sophisticated ones. Somebody may disagree with Olivier's conception of the character but everyone has to admit that while Larry acts he creates complete, convincing, living image of his hero (and very sympathetic, by the way).  I also would like to mention Jean Simmons. She seems to be severely misjudged by most reviewers.  Simmons is an excellent Ophelia &#150; a simple, naive young girl, merely a child, affectionate, light-hearted, playful, flirting and exceptionally sensitive. An absolutely charming scene is that of Laertes' departure. Polonius makes his solemn speech and Ophelia all the time mischievously distracts attention of her brother. I like all Olivier's films for such amusing trifles. Gertrude is well chosen too, quite believable. Eileen Herlie clear shows that at the end Gertrude understands her husband's wicked game and takes the poison consciously. However, Claudius is not impressive enough, to my mind.  To see a perfect thrilling Shakespearean villain you have to watch Kozintsev's film. Of course the play is noticeably cut. I confess I miss Hamlet's passionate soliloquy `Is not this monstrous that this player here&#133;', and also Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (they are important, for Hamlet faces the treachery of friends in their part). On the other hand more complete versions are rather overlong. I am not sure that Branagh's four hours movie gains anything from using the full text. This film is dynamic and worth seeing not only for the sake of Lord Laurence's outstanding performance, but because it is extraordinary interesting version of the familiar play.

Even after almost 80 years, Nosferatu is still scary, disgusting, mysterious and fascinating all at the same time, all thanks to the perfect performance by Schreck.F.W. Murnau does an excellent job as director of this film. The atmosphere and artistry he created in this film is what helped make it the classic it is today. I believe this is the first film in which two events happening at once are intercut. This is a common routine among movies now, but it's Murnau that helped pioneer it using this film.The only flaw I noticed watched this movie was the acting of Gustav von Wangenheim. I understand that for silent films like this one, a little overacting might be necessary, but I found Gustav to be annoying and distracting, and not very convincing at all in his role. He overacted WAY too much, and the fact that it's a silent film can't be used as an excuse for it. Max Schreck gave a brilliant performance, and Greta Schröder did a good job too, so there is no reason Gustav couldn't have.This tiny flaw hardly dampers the experience of this movie, however. It is definitely one of the best I've ever seen, and although it probably would not make my Top 10 list, it certainly makes my Top 20. This movie is highly recommended, not just horror movie fans, but for fans of movies in general.

The plot developed about as fast as drying paint, and had as much enthusiasm as well.  The premise of the movie revolves around a mother and son relationship, and how far she will go to keep him from harm. I kept thinking the movie would go to a commercial and I would see thirty-second spots for feminine hygiene and hair removal.  Alas, I was unlucky. Tilda Swinton (The Beach) plays the part of Margaret, the mother. Goran Visnjic (Practical Magic, Rounders) is the movie's antagonist Alek.  I found that Swinton's portrayal, as a calm collected mother, was at times farfetched.  No matter how bad things would get for her, she was able to maintain a sense of composure and continue a type of reform-school etiquette. Alek, at first, seems to be a complex character often brooding over what he needs to do get the money from Margaret.  Should he be more aggressive in his tactics?  He feels sorry for Margaret, and decides at some point that he should try to help her.   Complex?  I think not.  As I got further into the movie, it seemed that Goran, who may be best known as Dr. Luka Kovac from ER, was just looking for a little action from a sexually repressed middle-aged-station wagon-team mom. Margaret, being a typical nosey mom, follows a hunch that her son, Beau, might be cruising with the wrong crowd.  She asks the boy's gay lover to stop hanging around her son.  That night, the boy's thirty-something lover, Darby, shows up to the house. The Darby and Beaus argue and, unbeknownst to Beau, Darby falls victim to a cleverly placed anchor.  The church lady says it best, `How convenient!'  The next morning, Margaret discovers the body and immediately assumes that her son killed Darby.  What's a mother to do? I know! Hide the body in the shallowest part of Lake Tahoe.  Now that she has cleaned up Beau's `mess,' she decides to try to confront Beau by asking what happened, as if she didn't already know. Margaret is then approached by Alek and told that she must acquire $50,000 or a tape of her son with Darby, inflagrante, would be released to the police connecting him to the murder.  Again, some simple communication would prove useful here.  Margaret, on the other hand, decides to mortgage the house, pawn jewelry, and is only able to get about $12,000.  I was surprised that she didn't sell herself and\/or her daughter into prostitution.  That seemed fairly logical for a MENSA reject.  Lucky for her, Alek is willing to reduce his take on the deal, and she only needs to get $25,000.  `Thanks. You shouldn't have! No really, you shouldn't have.' Through all the trials and tribulation that I faced as I watched this film, I would like to applaud Siegel and McGehee's cinematographer Giles Nuttgens.  He was able to capture some of the best shots I have ever seen in a movie. `The Deep End', a.k.a. Water World 2, was saturated with scenes de l'eau. There were shots through aquariums, car washes, and, my favorite, a single droplet of water clinging to a drippy faucet.  It was a good thing I didn't have to go to the bathroom.  Characters were associated with water. Margaret's husband is on an aircraft carrier in the North Atlantic, and the youngest child is in a school production of Swan Lake.  Margaret's father-in-law has a heart attack as he transports jugs of water.  `Is there a doctor in the house?'  No, but Alek plays one on TV- it's a good thing he learned CPR while on ER. If you liked `Suture' or are a big believer in 75% of the earth's mass, then see the movie.

A struggling Mariachi guitarist walks into town looking for work, while at the same time a mob boss has sent his goons to hunt down a killer who carries his guns in a guitar case. They mistake the Mariachi for the killer, and the unsuspecting guitarist's world is turned upside-down. What ensues is a lot of action, gunplay, and a really great movie. The fact that the film is made on a nothing budget of $7,000 shows just how brilliant Robert Rodriguez is (watch the commentaries, they're actually fun and interesting). The actors did a commendable job in this film (considering none of them were professionals), especially the lead Carlos Gallardo. The cinematography is excellent, considering the lack of a film crew. The editing is very stylish and an excellent example of what can be done with a little ingenuity and even less money. This is the way independent films should be done. Blair Witch Project NOTHING! This is a film that should be shown in university film-making 101 classes.

With the exception of the remarkable height difference between the two leads (and we are talking about at least a foot!) this has to be perfect casting.Unfortunately dream casting can't help a fatally flawed movie. It is a sad fact that it is very difficult to make zombie characters interesting; without any common reference the audience has no emotional involvement with the story. Zombies have largely been restricted to shambling around the woods chewing on teenagers; perhaps wisely no one has seriously considered them starring in a period piece opposite Kate Winslet or a romantic comedy with Meg Ryan ('When Harry Ate Sally' anyone?).There are two ways to make such characters interesting. One is to give them a tiny facet of humanity - the scene in Frankenstein where he meets the blind man, or the relationship between the Terminator and the child John Conner show how this can be pulled off successfully. The second is to play them as ruthless machines, bent on destruction (Terminator first time round).There is none of that in this movie, and it manages to miss both solutions. The attempted relationship between the newly human van Damme and Ally Walker is undermined by having him suddenly regain all his memories and playing the part of a normal human being with a Pinnochio complex. The man-child role is a challenging one for skilled actors, in the hands of someone less talented it is embarrassing. Want to guess what it is here?The second part is undermined by not keeping the bad guy as an unthinking machine. Lundgren's character suddenly regains his psychotic personality. This is clearly someone suffering from a medical problem, not the usual two-dimensional movie killer. A clever plot (think Frankenstein (the book)) might want to try and resolve the problem by playing on the human part of the character; a bad plot would have him kicked to death and chopped to pieces. Want to guess again?The second problem is the casting. Obviously Carolco couldn't afford the salaries demanded by Schwarzenegger and Stallone, so they had to pick from the B-squad, and it shows. van Damme rolls through this movie on the twin charms of having puppy dog eyes and showing his backside. Lundgren emotes his role with all the charm of a run-down Speak and Spell machine. (Which is odd, because when I've seen Dolph Lundgren interviewed he's witty and charming; but put him in front of the movie camera and you're wondering if someone has forgotten to flick the 'ON' switch).Individually they are painful to watch; together - excruciating.It's not a complete loss on the performance front; if you watch very carefully you'll see that Ally Walker is in fact acting (and stands out a mile for doing so). Her lines are ludicrous, her character is painfully underdeveloped but Walker does a reasonable job of trying to play a halfway-realistic character. Sadly what starts off as an independent, successful woman is quickly reduced to bimbette status screaming on the sidelines. So much for feminism.Is there anything else to recommend this movie. No, not really, there is a neat abseiling stunt near the beginning and lots of stuff blows up, but for the first time in my life I would have to admit that not nearly enough stuff blows up.Universal Soldier's greatest contribution to movie history has to be that it helped sink Carolco. Cinema audiences stayed away in droves from this charmless production and it is perhaps best remembered for the desperate publicity 'fight' between Lundgren and van Damme at Cannes.

On the one hand, the first half of the film is stylish, sinister, thought-provoking - Kubrickian cinema at its awe-inspiring best. Spielberg managed to avoid his usual trick of laying sentimentality on with a trowel, and I was genuinely believing I was witnessing a masterpiece.

What on earth possessed the man to morph an eerie psychological drama into an ultimately boring and far-fetched yarn? The film is painfully long. The storyline meanders from mildly unbelievable to utterly incoherent.

Haley John Osment's performance brings guile, empathy and intelligence beyond his thirteen years, to a film which (apart from Teddy) is devoid of characters with any depth. His portrayal his character, David, ranks as one of the finest and most haunting performances I have seen. It is such a shame that the ridiculous storyline had me rooting for the conclusion of the film, not for the main character. Aesthetically, A.I is impressive, but with such a large budget, that is only to be expected. David's companion on his ludicrous quest, Teddy, also brought out the child in me and I found myself genuinely concerned for his wellbeing. As unbelievable as his recovery was, the introduction of David's 'brother' was a welcome addition to the film. The relationship between the two is something that was not handled badly, but could have definitely been handled better.Thus, A.I. left me wanting more. Why couldn't the film have reached a logical conclusion? Why was such a nonsensical and bastardised version of such a stimulating subject matter allowed to have been made? Has Spielberg finally lost the plot? If I were Kubrick, I would be turning in my grave, cursing the time I ever told my 'chum' Steve about a continuation of the HAL concept. I resent the fact that A.I. was made, as this is surely not the conclusion that Kubrick would have reached. If you have not seen A.I., then please go and see it, just to see how good it could have been. But brace yourself for an overtly long, frustrating film of epic proportions that tries to say too much, but ends saying little.

I had read several reviews on this site and was disappointed that some spoilers were revealed without warnings. So, even though I knew about some things, I can still say that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  Billy Bob Thornton was phenomenal!  His performance alone was worth watching the movie for.  I'm a new fan!  He was incredible. He could have easily ruined the character, but instead he made him my favorite!  Fantastic acting on Thornton's part.  Bruce Willis disappointingly played his character, but it's bearable.  Kate Blanchett was also very good.  It would have been very easy for her to over-act her character (she was borderline) but kept her performance very believable.  I admit, the movie did lull a bit about a third of the way into it, but I soon found myself enjoying it more and more, and by the end I was totally into it and loving every minute.  It does incorporate several genres of film comedy\/action\/romance.  And, I think it does an excellent job of putting them all together in the same movie.  Don't miss this one because of bad reviews, I loved it!   ","genre":null},{"date":"1 November 2001","score":"","review":"  I almost didn't go see this movie.
