The effects are exceptionally done all the way. The acting varies, but it's never distractingly poor. Dialog... about the same, with some real high points here and there. The humor is absolutely great. It's never forced nor does it ever try too hard, and genuine comedy is the result, and it doesn't reach a level where the seriousness of the whole is lost, either. The cinematography and editing, the technical side of this in general, in marvelous. While there is some violence herein, this operates more through building tension. Suspense.

This couldn't matter less to Richard Blaney (Jon Finch), a bitter, washed-up veteran who loses his job at a pub and is generally mad at the world. But Blaney soon becomes the prime suspect after his ex-wife (Barbara Leigh-Hunt) becomes a victim of the killer - and the circumstantial evidence implicating him becomes overwhelming. With the help of co-worker\/lover Babs (Anna Massey) and the reluctant help of an old RAF buddy and his wife (Clive Swift and Billie Whitelaw), he goes on the lam, further implicating him. After Babs is found strangled, Blaney is arrested - but Chief Inspector Oxford (Alec McCowan) of Scotland Yard begins to doubt his guilt. Soon, he realizes that the wrong man is in jail - and that the murderer is actually Blaney's buddy Bob Rusk (Barry Foster), a seemingly cheerful Covent Garden grocer. However, Blaney has escaped from jail, and Oxford must get to Rusk before Blaney does in order to sure that the right man is caught.On the surface, Frenzy is a rather typical Alfred Hitchcock film, exploring the familiar ground of a man implicated in a crime he didn't commit, but against whom the evidence is overwhelming. But Hitchcock is able to add some new twists, and a great deal of darkness which make the film stand out in his canon. While not held in terribly high regard by most Hitch enthusiasts, I would name Frenzy as being one of his two or three best films.After years of self-imposed exile from his homeland, Hitchcock makes a triumphant return to London, and the early sections of the movie show a director sending a big coming-home Valentine to his native land. But the movie is more than that; the attitude quickly becomes dark, sour and sardonic. A British official (John Boxer) giving a speech on pollution is interrupted by the discovery of a body in the river beneath him. Two Englishmen have a rather dark discussion about serial killers and their appropriateness in London; indeed, London is the home of Jack the Ripper, so a serial killer on the prowl is business as usual for most. Unlike Americans, the British are rather blasé about the prospect of a murderer in their midst. This essentially British attitude pervades the film, as Hitchcock employs his trademark dark humor to accentuate the violence going on around him.The movie has several striking images and scenes which make it stand out. The most obvious is the murder of Barbara Leigh-Hunt, an uncomfortably long and graphic scene of rape and violence, where Hitchcock takes full advantage of the increasingly lax censorship. The shot of Leigh-Hunt's corpse with its tongue dangling out is extremely chilling. Even more effective is the murder of Babs, as Hitchcock sets us up, then pans back through the apartment and out into the bustling street - a bravura piece of film making that says more than another, equally graphic strangulation could have. The scene where Rusk rides a potato truck to recover a bit of evidence from one of his victims (another typical Hitchcock device - making us sympathize with the killer) is effectively suspenseful. The scenes of comedy, particularly the Inspector's gourmet dinners with his wife (Vivien Merchant), go along with rather than provide relief from the violent goings-on in the main plot. And the denouement is classic Hitch.Another ingenious twist is the character of Dick Blaney. Blaney is another Hitchcockian wrong man who, seemingly trapped by circumstantial evidence and afraid of the police, goes on the run, seemingly implicating himself. But unlike previous such characters - Henry Fonda in The Wrong Man, Grace Kelly in Dial M For Murder, Cary Grant in To Catch a Thief and North By Northwest - Blaney is a completely surly, unlikeable character who nags his ex-wife, carries on in public, and is a complete an utter jerk (as evidenced by a surprisingly affective shot where he tramples a box of grapes on the street). Bob Rusk, by contrast, is cheerful, friendly and helpful - when he's not strangling women, of course. It's very hard to work up much sympathy for Blaney; while some consider this a drawback, I'd actually consider it a benefit, and it's an intriguing twist on a hoary old idea that Hitchcock pulls of brilliantly.The cast is uniformly excellent. Hitchcock probably benefits from the lack of established stars; the B- and C-list actors here are probably better for not having the baggage of a screen persona with them. Jon Finch pulls off his rather difficult character well, avoiding the temptation to make Blaney likable. Barry Foster turns in a chillingly effective performance as Rusk, making him one of Hitchcock's greatest villains. Anna Massey and Barbara Leigh-Hunt are both charming, while Jean Marsh is effective as the cold-hearted, man-hating secretary who is key in convicting Blaney. Alex McCowan and Vivien Merchant provide several scenes of hysterical black humor as the Investigator and his wife. Clive Swift, Billie Whitelaw, Elsie Randolph and Michael Bates round out the cast nicely.Frenzy is arguably the best of Hitchcock's later efforts, and it stands up very well even next to his best work. By adding a few neat twists and a welcome edge of darkness, the Master of Suspense creates another masterful thriller.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 May 2008","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" A serial killer is on the loose in London - a sex maniac who rapes his victims and then strangles them with his tie.

I had only seen Ernest Borgnine in later films or TV shows where he played lovable but goofy characters. I had never seen him in a serious role like this. I LOVED it! The man can ACT! I'm a big fan of classic films, and this one was right on the money. Borgnine plays the part of Marty Piletti, a lonely Italian butcher in his mid-thirties, who's tired of being burned in the game of love. He's henpecked by his friends, family, and acquaintances about when he's ever going to get married. He'd like to, but he's convinced that at this point that he's going to be a bachelor for the rest of his life.But then through a strange twist of fate, he meets Clara, an equally lonely school teacher who's considered a dog by most men, but not by Marty. Similar life experiences draw them together, and sparks fly! But can Marty overcome the prejudice of his friends, and the meddling of his family, to finally attain love? Well, you'll have to watch the movie.The only problem I have with this film is that I wish it had run longer, and expanded on Marty's struggle to overcome the prejudice of his friends, and his own self-doubt about his feelings for Clara.

Spielberg directs and writes this story that Kubrick tried to make for years but died just as he was going to start it. It's not that I don't think Spielberg could handle it; I just think Kubrick is the better director and could do it better. His amazing attention to little details and situations make nearly all of his films classics and this one might have been no different. Lamenting aside, this is still a pretty decent film with incredible visual effects. There is no arguing Spielberg is a great visual director and he certainly handles the material here very well. Every scene is filled with awe and wonder as we are overwhelmed with stunning pictures and images. The biggest problem here is the script which runs along fine for about ninety minutes, then turns into a very different kind of a film. What starts out as a heartwarming journey about a young robot trying to become a boy turns into a horror story of bizarre experiences. In my opinion, Spielberg got bogged down in the sentimental material an d didn't focus on the dehumanization of a futuristic society; something Kubrick certainly would have done. There is a point where it should have ended to save face and it could have been one of Spielberg's best. Nevertheless, he presses on and goes for the tearjerker, which doesn't work and only makes us scratch our heads.

Spielberg directs and writes this story that Kubrick tried to make for years but died just as he was going to start it. It's not that I don't think Spielberg could handle it; I just think Kubrick is the better director and could do it better. His amazing attention to little details and situations make nearly all of his films classics and this one might have been no different. Lamenting aside, this is still a pretty decent film with incredible visual effects. There is no arguing Spielberg is a great visual director and he certainly handles the material here very well. Every scene is filled with awe and wonder as we are overwhelmed with stunning pictures and images. The biggest problem here is the script which runs along fine for about ninety minutes, then turns into a very different kind of a film. What starts out as a heartwarming journey about a young robot trying to become a boy turns into a horror story of bizarre experiences. In my opinion, Spielberg got bogged down in the sentimental material an d didn't focus on the dehumanization of a futuristic society; something Kubrick certainly would have done. There is a point where it should have ended to save face and it could have been one of Spielberg's best. Nevertheless, he presses on and goes for the tearjerker, which doesn't work and only makes us scratch our heads. In the end, here is a story which we simply cannot connect with the main characters since they are all artificial robots. Of course it was a risk to do this, and at times it does succeed, but more often it does not.

Most scoffed. 'Superman' was considered baby stuff, fodder for poorly animated Saturday morning shows.The idea to do the film came from Pierre Spengler, who suggested the D.C. comics character to producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind as a follow-up to their hit 'Three Musketeers' movies.

The tension in the precinct building develops very well as the anonymous phantoms converge, and keeps you guessing what will come next.

Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the finest films ever made and do I dare say Spielberg's masterpiece? Yes I'm aware that Schindler's List is the better film but quality can be measured in so many different ways. Harrison Ford first dons the fedora here and at first glance we can tell that this is his prized role and the one he will forever be loved for. Indiana Jones is a superhero but he is a superhero who can captures the movie goer's imaginations and hearts in a way that Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man could only do in his wildest dreams. The audience admires Indiana Jones because is brave, he's intelligent, he is the personification of the ideal romantic hero and most of all he is human in ways we can identify with. There's just something that all fits together about this picture. It is one of the few films that has truly grasped onto my inner child and imagination. Never has an adventure been as grand as it is Raiders. Karen Allen is as important to this film's success as Ford's. She is the perfect love interest for Indiana Jones because she brings out the best qualities in him. She like Jones is spunky and full of the adventurous ambition. She isn't baggage and she quite often gives our hero a run for his money. She like Indy is also very human and likable. The romance here is real. It's hard to imagine real love and romance in an adventure film but it is real. We liked Marion Ravenwood as Indy's love interest because the scenes between her and Indiana Jones showed love in all the deepness and emotional conviction it has, and it didn't show us James Bond's make love and throw away love. The love in Raiders is as close to the real emotion as your going to get to in these types of films..I really think the plot here is the best of the series of Jones films, all though it really isn't fair comparing the sequels to this simply because This IS history. Hitler wanting the most sacred of Jewish artifacts to conquer the world is one of the most inspired premises of well, any film. We have the romantic hero in Indiana Jones but we also have evil in the form of the Nazis. The cult of personality surrounding Hitler stays with you. I consider myself to be smart and sensible and I don't get afraid much but the stock footage of Nazi rallies really scare the hell out of me. The Nazis were one of the must vile cults to ever exist and if any thing could embody modern day evil it would be them. Like Indy the villains are to be taken very seriously. By no means are the Nazis in Raiders cut out villains. Even our chief antagonist Rene Belloq is hesitant to ally himself to them, he says it is a necessary evil.Execution is key to Raider's success. The script is intelligent but it also shows that it's roots where planted by the serials of the 30's. Spielberg and company take the material as serious as the grave. Nothing is played for laughs or shock value for the sake of laughs or shock value. In creating a homage to the classic serials, Spielberg actually outdid them and set a new unreachable high standard for the adventure\/action flick.I love the story of Indiana Jones' humble origins. Say what you will about George Lucas but steering Spielberg away from doing a James Bond film and pointing him toward this direction is one of the defining moments of cinematic history. Before you take the kids to see fun popcorn film Crystal Skull show them the cinematic master piece Raiders of the Lost Ark.

She isn't baggage and she quite often gives our hero a run for his money. She like Indy is also very human and likable. The romance here is real. It's hard to imagine real love and romance in an adventure film but it is real. We liked Marion Ravenwood as Indy's love interest because the scenes between her and Indiana Jones showed love in all the deepness and emotional conviction it has, and it didn't show us James Bond's make love and throw away love. The love in Raiders is as close to the real emotion as your going to get to in these types of films..I really think the plot here is the best of the series of Jones films, all though it really isn't fair comparing the sequels to this simply because This IS history. Hitler wanting the most sacred of Jewish artifacts to conquer the world is one of the most inspired premises of well, any film. We have the romantic hero in Indiana Jones but we also have evil in the form of the Nazis. The cult of personality surrounding Hitler stays with you. I consider myself to be smart and sensible and I don't get afraid much but the stock footage of Nazi rallies really scare the hell out of me. The Nazis were one of the must vile cults to ever exist and if any thing could embody modern day evil it would be them. Like Indy the villains are to be taken very seriously. By no means are the Nazis in Raiders cut out villains. Even our chief antagonist Rene Belloq is hesitant to ally himself to them, he says it is a necessary evil.Execution is key to Raider's success. The script is intelligent but it also shows that it's roots where planted by the serials of the 30's. Spielberg and company take the material as serious as the grave. Nothing is played for laughs or shock value for the sake of laughs or shock value. In creating a homage to the classic serials, Spielberg actually outdid them and set a new unreachable high standard for the adventure\/action flick.I love the story of Indiana Jones' humble origins.

Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the finest films ever made and do I dare say Spielberg's masterpiece? Yes I'm aware that Schindler's List is the better film but quality can be measured in so many different ways. Harrison Ford first dons the fedora here and at first glance we can tell that this is his prized role and the one he will forever be loved for. Indiana Jones is a superhero but he is a superhero who can captures the movie goer's imaginations and hearts in a way that Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man could only do in his wildest dreams. The audience admires Indiana Jones because is brave, he's intelligent, he is the personification of the ideal romantic hero and most of all he is human in ways we can identify with. There's just something that all fits together about this picture. It is one of the few films that has truly grasped onto my inner child and imagination.

No such complaints were needed for the third installment whatever angle one looks at it from, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is perfect from start to finish.As in the previous films, there's a mandatory opening scene that features great action and shows just how cool Indy is. However, there's a twist this time around the prologue concerns the young Indiana (River Phoenix), and so the first fifteen minutes of the movie are spent revealing where he learned to master a whip and why he is so afraid of snakes. More crucially, though, the extended beginning shows a not-so-good relationship between the boy and his father, Henry Jones Sr., a theme that is brought up again with the more familiar Indy (Harrison Ford) he is asked to by an American millionaire (Julian Glover) to participate in an expedition whose aim is to retrieve the legendary Holy Grail. You've got the wrong Jones Indy quips, only to discover his old man (Sean Connery) is the leader of the expedition and has mysteriously disappeared. Enter a globe-trotting adventure that will involve rats, Venice, the desert, Nazis, the return of Brody (Denholm Elliott) and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) and lots more, all told in the classic B-adventure style we're used to.Last Crusade is considerably lighter in tone than its predecessor, and therefore much more fun, with one set-piece after another, state-of-the-art visual effects and brilliant characters (Temple of Doom basically had only Short Round to brag about). In particular, Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), while no match for Marion Ravenwood, is a more intriguing presence than the quite one-dimensional Willie Scott from the second flick, being at the center of one of the terrific script's greatest inventions (and given the film was released in 1989, it's some achievement they actually got away with it - you know what I mean if you've seen the movie).Ford is, of course, as excellent as he was in the other two Indies, but Crusade's real treat is Connery. His casting started as an in-joke (Spielberg said Indiana Jones was his version of James Bond, therefore Bond should be his father), but he lives up to expectations engaging in one hell of an acting duet with Junior, their conversations being packed with wit and warmth. Given the director's recurring use of father\/son themes, there was a slight risk those scenes could come off as too schmaltzy for an Indiana Jones picture, but thankfully the Henry-Indy relationship feels completely natural and unforced, never once overshadowing the massive sense of fun that derives from the movie.Perhaps the best way to describe the spirit of these films is a wonderful scene where Jones Sr. and Jr. react to being hunted by Nazis. These men are trying to kill us! the elder Jones remarks. I know, Dad! comes the answer. It's a whole new experience for me! Henry adds.

The acting is superb and the plot thought provoking. What really stands out is the dialog which is several notches above the usual drivel that comes out of Hollywood. Very quickly you come to like and care about the characters in this film and by the end of this film it is very hard not to get weepy eyed. I have never really noticed that this movie is long and I don't think it is possible to cut any parts out without losing something important.

And the special edition with the added bells and whistles already gives it a more shiner coat of paint made even more delicious on digital widescreen.

How does Steven Spielberg do it? He creates one motion picture blockbuster after another, each one one of the best ones there are. Either it's a JURASSIC PARK or an E.T., or it's a next Best Picture Oscar contender as SHINDLER'S LIST, Spielberg is one hit-maker that doesn't seem to run out of gas. MINORITY REPORT is 2002's latest model, it's also one of Spielberg's finest. Not only is it an expensive summer attraction, MINORITY REPORT is also a clever, inventive ideal sci-fi movie with neat plot twists, intelligent plotting and some very inventive imaginations-come-to-life. This is more than just another special effects extravaganza that let your eyes feast upon. This time, your brain can enjoy it too.Spielberg's view of the future isn't just a video game-inspired metropolis with nothing much happening but a lot of running and chasing. This one actually grows a plot and a brain. Taking place in 2054, the futuristic Washington D.C. lessens from crime and injustice thanks to an advanced system called Pre-crime, an advanced computer system which makes use of Pre-cogs, three genetically altered humans who identify criminals before they commit their crimes. Futuristic cop John Anderton (Tom Cruise, out for another mission impossible) is one of the Pre-crime cops, but when he himself is framed for committing a murder (using his long grudge for the loss of his son), the tables have been turned, making Anderton the latest target of the perfect system he helped put up.Visually, MINORITY REPORT is a blast of visual achievements. Special effects created by Industrial Light & Magic matched with Alex McDowell's imaginative production design provide a terrific amount of imaginative craftsmanship. The special effects here show how far we have come when it comes to effects craftsmanship, as well as how far our imaginations have advanced. But the movie isn't all special effects and flash, MINORITY REPORT is also a brilliantly plotted mystery thriller which delivers both the mystery and the thrills. The plot, based on Phillip K. Dick's story, is impressively put on screen without showing the little sense of stupidity. Spielberg doesn't dumb it down for the sake of special effects. He values the plot, characters and suspense as much, if not more, than the expensive effects and sets. This is sheer proof that Spielberg still knows the Hollywood film-making enterprise, and MINORITY REPORT is still one of his best contributions to the genre.Rating ***** out of 5.

This movie is, without a doubt, positive proof that Jack Nicholson is most often an appalling actor, one-note and overrated, whose talent is almost as lacking as his taste in role choices. His only ability seems to be playing sociopaths, crazies, loons...characters of that nature. Even in his romantic comedies, his characters are practically always certifiable and badly portrayed! Sure, there are rare exceptions (i.e. The Shining,) but for the most part, he is a poor excuse for an actor. Not only does he have no range, but he, along with nearly everyone else in the movie-watching crowd of the world, seems to think that he's a great actor, one of the best! It's a hideous case of a persona being massively over-hyped! Not only that, but his portrayal of the Joker has got to be the single worst performance of his entire career! I can't believe people actually watch this drivel! In fact, the only three things worse than Jack's bland, cookie-cutter act are Kim Basinger's overdone and, yet, emotionally unconvincing performance, Michael Keaton's effort, which makes Basinger's role look like a slice of heaven, and the movie itself. This is, without a doubt, the most overrated and least deserving comic book movie ever made! Even the later Batman movies were better; at least they were entertaining in their stupidity! At least they had style, and didn't pretend to be something they could never be in a million years! At least Jim Carrey, Danny DeVito, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Uma Thurman and their cohorts were fun to watch! I'm just so disappointed that the masses are convinced by this film!
