Unsurprisingly, viewing it with fresh eyes that had never been laid upon Alfred Hitchcock's original, I enjoyed it greatly (had this not been a remake, it would've been an easy *** 1\/2), but certainly not without the realization that all the credit on a visual and auditory level-the camerawork, the atmosphere and mood, the score-belongs to the original.For those who are somehow still unfamiliar with the plot, a brief summary is in order.  Marion Crane (Anne Heche) is a young secretary who makes an impulsive decision to steal $400,000 in cash from one of her boss' rich clients.  Hoping to use this money to get her lover, Sam Loomis (Viggo Mortensen), out of debt, she makes a quick getaway out of town, trading in her car to avoid the authorities.On the second night of her drive, it's particularly rainy and she's almost about to fall asleep behind the wheel so she stops at a quaint little place off the main highway called the Bates motel.  The proprietor, Norman Bates (Vince Vaughn), is a quirky fellow, but seems nice enough.  So Marion stays the night, but finds herself somewhat concerned when she hears Norman arguing with his mother up in that big house of his.  And she sure as hell isn't going to like his mother when she's upset.I'm not exactly sure how to review the film.  Considering I saw this before the original, I want to approach this as I would any other review, to talk about what I liked and didn't like, but because it's a scene-for-scene remake it's practically begging for comparison and criticism.In certain cases, remakes are far superior to the original (Gore Verbinski's The Ring was even scarier than the Japanese Ringu), but that's typically because the films they're based on had some major flaws to begin with that could be corrected on.  Is Hitchcock's Psycho flawed?  Actually, it is, but they're only minor quibbles.  There really is no reason to remake a movie as superbly directed as Psycho so I'm not sure what Gus Van Sant was trying to prove.  He's always been known as a fairly gutsy filmmaker, perhaps he just wanted to test the limits of his `boldness' and see how far he could go in remaking a classic without getting literally butchered.There are two major aspects in which this new rendition stands apart from its predecessor.  The acting is the most obvious and I'd even argue that Van Sant's version is slightly superior to Hitchcock's in this regard.  The performances are overall excellent, most every major performer adding some new touches.  Viggo Mortensen and Julianne Moore, in particular, are better than the previous actors in their respective roles (Vera Miles had Moore's part, but I can't remember who played Loomis in the original).  Mortensen gives Loomis an appropriate laid-back attitude and Moore, in true 90's fashion, is a take-charge chick who won't take b.s. from anybody. William H. Macy feels perfectly natural as private detective Arbogast and Anne Heche is actually about on par with Janet Leigh as Marion Crane.  Her role requires little more than to make us feel sympathetic toward her situation and Heche accomplishes the task with little trouble.  In a small but vital part, Robert Forster proves much, much better than the original actor with the same role; Forster is more relaxed and confident.But the most important role is Norman Bates and the casting choice here is a bit of a backfire here.  Anybody who's seen the Hitchcock version knows the marvelous acting job of Anthony Perkins.  It's hard to live up to these expectations, and while I wouldn't say Vince Vaughn was vomit-inducingly awful, it's not a very good performance.  Vaughn is constantly obsessed with playing the part as inanely quirky as possible, to make Bates as unsubtle a weirdo as possible, just shy of telling everyone `I'm a complete freak!' as opposed to Perkins' natural and disquieting performance.  Just as debilitating ist he fact that Vaughn's performance feels like obvious acting.  The little tics apparent in Norman's behavior appear more as if Vaughn is simply pretending to have such little quirks rather than genuine eccentric acts.  When Vaughn states, mother isn't feeling well, it sounds more like a parody of Perkins' performance than an oddball man with no social skills.  Even if I hadn't seen Perkins' take, I'd still be dissatisfied with Vaughn's portrayal.The film is obviously visually different from its predecessor, but it's also pretty fantastic in this regard; the addition of color accentuates a familiar, yet  slightly different atmosphere than the original, and some of the retro costumes and sets are fairly amusing, if not also a bit distracting.  It's also nice to hear Bernard Hermann's wonderful score left intact.The question on hand is whether this movie is really worth recommending. Unlike most viewers, my `untainted' eyes had a great time watching this suspenseful and wonderfully creepy thriller, but the same goes for the original.  Give this one a shot if you've never seen the original, but watch Hitchcock's version just to see where the filmmaking brilliance originated.

This has both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, I am free from the need to consider whether it was better or worse than the original films. On the other, there was much about it that I found confusing, but which might have been clearer had I seen those films.The film tries to combine two genres, science fiction and sword-and-sorcery fantasy. These might be thought to be mutually exclusive, as the first is normally set in a high-tech future and the second in an imaginary low-tech past, but here they are brought together by having the action set in a far-away galaxy `a long time ago' and by using scientific technology in much the same way as sorcery is used in more conventional fantasy films. Some low-tech elements, however, survive; in a society that has developed long-distance space travel it seems illogical that some characters' weapon of choice is the `light sabre,' a device that enables them to kill an enemy standing within about two yards of them (an ability that the human race has possessed ever since the first caveman made a spear by tying a sharpened flint to a stick). The light sabre, of course, has nothing to do with logic; it was simply invented to enable the characters to have hand-to-hand duels in the best swashbuckling tradition.The plot of The Phantom Menace concerns an invasion by the Trade Federation (which sounds like a businessmen's club but is actually an evil empire planning to take over large parts of the galaxy) invades the peaceful planet of Naboo. Queen Amidala, the young ruler of Naboo, escapes, and continues the fight against the Federation with the help of two Jedi Knights (members of an ancient and mystical brotherhood of warriors), Jar Jar Binks (a member of an underwater race who share Naboo with its human inhabitants), and Anakin Skywalker (a young boy rescued from slavery on a desert planet).The characters in the film are divided into humans and aliens, and the alien ones (Jar Jar Binks in particular) seem to have caused a good deal of adverse comment. Well yes, I did find Jar Jar with his broken English extremely irritating, and wondered why subtitles weren't provided for his scenes. On the other hand, I was almost equally irritated by Yoda (a bat-eared garden gnome who leads the Jedi) and his peculiar inverted sentences. One have thought would that a character who so wise is supposed to be by now of English syntax the rules would have learnt. In fact, none of the alien characters seemed particularly credible; I have seen more convincing aliens in old television programmes such as Doctor Who or Star Trek, which were made on a tiny fraction of the Star Wars budget. The aliens were all supposed to be either kindly or malevolent, but all of them merely seemed risible.If the alien characters, however, were unconvincing, the human ones were worse. The acting was of a uniformly poor standard, even from actors such as Liam Neeson whom I have admired in other productions. A special mention has to go to Natalie Portman, whose portrayal of Queen Amidala was distinguished by its woodenness and lifelessness. It is hard to believe that she was the girl who was so impressive in Beautiful Girls and Leon. I am not impressed by the explanation that George Lucas deliberately required wooden acting as `homage' to old science-fiction B-movies. That might shift the blame from the actors to the director, but it does not make the film any better. And why pay homage to something that was rubbish in the first place?There were many things about this movie that I found difficult to understand. It was never convincingly explained what the Trade Federation was, or why it wanted to invade Naboo, or what its relationship was to the other villains in the film, or the role of another, more benevolent, political institution called `The Republic.' The biggest mystery surrounded the semi-religious philosophy of the Jedi, which centred on a mysterious entity called the Force, something else that was never satisfactorily explained. At times the Force seemed to be regarded as a form of psychic energy that could be used for either good or evil purposes; at others, when the Jedi talked about `the will of the Force', it seemed merely to be another name for God. Eventually, the explanation was given that the Force is connected to the presence in the human bloodstream of micro-organisms called `mitichlorians', although the exact nature of the connection remained elusive. If these matters had been explained, this would have been a better film. (And no, it is not good enough to say that I might have understood the film more if I had seen three other films made more than twenty years ago).Incidentally, I found it difficult to believe in a boy called `Annie'. In addition, greater familiarity with vulgar British slang might have persuaded the scriptwriter that `Obi-Wan Kenobi' was not a very good name for a character. (Say it quickly and you'll know what I mean).So what is good about this film? Well, the computer-generated special effects are, of course, impressive, but without believable characters or plot that is not enough to make a good film. The result is merely a high-tech version of those old space invader arcade games, full of sound and fury but signifying nothing. 4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 January 2004","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  Unlike most of those who have reviewed this film, I have never seen the original Star Wars trilogy from the late 1970s and early 1980s.

On the other, there was much about it that I found confusing, but which might have been clearer had I seen those films.The film tries to combine two genres, science fiction and sword-and-sorcery fantasy. These might be thought to be mutually exclusive, as the first is normally set in a high-tech future and the second in an imaginary low-tech past, but here they are brought together by having the action set in a far-away galaxy `a long time ago' and by using scientific technology in much the same way as sorcery is used in more conventional fantasy films. Some low-tech elements, however, survive; in a society that has developed long-distance space travel it seems illogical that some characters' weapon of choice is the `light sabre,' a device that enables them to kill an enemy standing within about two yards of them (an ability that the human race has possessed ever since the first caveman made a spear by tying a sharpened flint to a stick). The light sabre, of course, has nothing to do with logic; it was simply invented to enable the characters to have hand-to-hand duels in the best swashbuckling tradition.The plot of The Phantom Menace concerns an invasion by the Trade Federation (which sounds like a businessmen's club but is actually an evil empire planning to take over large parts of the galaxy) invades the peaceful planet of Naboo. Queen Amidala, the young ruler of Naboo, escapes, and continues the fight against the Federation with the help of two Jedi Knights (members of an ancient and mystical brotherhood of warriors), Jar Jar Binks (a member of an underwater race who share Naboo with its human inhabitants), and Anakin Skywalker (a young boy rescued from slavery on a desert planet).The characters in the film are divided into humans and aliens, and the alien ones (Jar Jar Binks in particular) seem to have caused a good deal of adverse comment. Well yes, I did find Jar Jar with his broken English extremely irritating, and wondered why subtitles weren't provided for his scenes. On the other hand, I was almost equally irritated by Yoda (a bat-eared garden gnome who leads the Jedi) and his peculiar inverted sentences. One have thought would that a character who so wise is supposed to be by now of English syntax the rules would have learnt.

The aliens were all supposed to be either kindly or malevolent, but all of them merely seemed risible.If the alien characters, however, were unconvincing, the human ones were worse. The acting was of a uniformly poor standard, even from actors such as Liam Neeson whom I have admired in other productions. A special mention has to go to Natalie Portman, whose portrayal of Queen Amidala was distinguished by its woodenness and lifelessness. It is hard to believe that she was the girl who was so impressive in Beautiful Girls and Leon. I am not impressed by the explanation that George Lucas deliberately required wooden acting as `homage' to old science-fiction B-movies. That might shift the blame from the actors to the director, but it does not make the film any better.

He claims that The Lawnmower Man's film adaptation is absolutely nothing like his story. Yet this is the man who allowed his name to be used for The Running Man with Arnold Schwarzenegger (a great mindless action flick), even though it's absolutely nothing like the book (which I have read, and which loses focus towards the middle). King wrote under the pseudonym of Richard Bachman for The Running Man (and several other books), but he still allowed his name to be used as part of the advertising run for Arnie's film version of his novel.

I had heard a lot of good things about this film--err, I thought I did. Turns out that the film has generally low ratings anyway The Internet Movie Database has the film clocked in at exactly 5.0 (out of a possible 10) stars as of January 14th, 2004, and Rotten Tomatoes has a Rotten reading of the film with 50% good (and bad) reviews.Jeff Fahey (who?) plays Jobe, a mentally retarded lawn mower (not the machine, I mean a real lawn mower man) who gets picked on by friends, rents a small room at a church run by a crazy priest (why are the priests always crazy?), and allows himself to be beaten by the crazy old man. Oh, and he hangs out with a small kid named Peter (Austin O'Brien) every day. Yep, he's got a nice life. He's certainly not a loser.This changes when Larry (Pierce Brosnan in a pre-Bond role) experiments on Jobe using his state-of-the-art virtual reality simulator, which engages areas of Jobe's brain, making him become smarter (and apparently stronger?) in very little time. Soon he's experiencing new sensations with the town *flirt* and boasting a bunch of strong muscles.But Jobe starts to lose control when his mind becomes too strong, and he learns how to take apart human beings' bodies with special effects--which pretty much means he turns everyone into hundreds of small digital bits. (There is one thing, however, that doesn't fit--how in the world does someone turn human beings into electronic form when they're in the real world?! Oh, wait, maybe he's in The Matrix and he's an Agent--that would work. They should try a tie-in Neo vs. The Lawnmower Man. Actually, on second thought...no.)I didn't buy Jeff Fahey as a retard for one single moment. He more or less looked like Jeff Daniels' character Harry Dunne, from Dumb and Dumber, for the first hour--prancing about with shaggy blond hair and muttering words like an idiot. I can honestly say that Fahey is not representing most mentally challenged people in his role for this film. And if he is, someone should sue him.Fahey (I'll ask again who?) is not a great actor, and either is Pierce Brosnan, who more or less keeps this film alive throughout. His is the best performance in the film. Admit it, that's pretty sad. (For the record, I like Brosnan as James Bond--I think he's the best since THE best Connery--but sometimes he gets in over his head in films. This is one of them.)I really did look forward to The Lawnmower Man, but I had no idea what to expect. I didn't think it would be as weird as this. I thought that--given what little I knew about the plot--there was the potential to make an interesting, engaging science fiction film (I'm not exactly a huge fan of the genre, although some people who are might like this film).

When Jobe inserts his mind into the computer (how does on do that?), he turns into the image of a bald man with edgy features and lumber logs for limbs. Huh?

","genre":"Drama, Horror"},{"date":"14 January 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  ** a few spoilers **This movie almost requires repeated viewings to deliver its full impact, with layer upon layer of quiet dread and small, seemingly mundane moments of bizarreness building up to a devastatingly terrifying climax.  The devil here is in the details, and those well-thought-out, lovingly executed details add up to make this one of the  intellectually complex and chilling movies of all time.When I first saw this movie in the theater at 16, I thought it was creepy but it didn't really get to me until the end.  Ahh the simple innocence of youth! The more I've watched it as I got older, though, the more I've appreciated the creepy subtleties of this masterpiece.  It's like a good old Islay scotch; at first you might not like it much, but age and experience reveals the true depth of its quality.Most people who deride this film do so because of Shelly Duvall's effective unattractive performance as the hapless and befuddled Wendy, and the fact that it doesn't follow King's masterpiece novel verbatim.  I prefer to think of it as Kubrick's near genius-level reinterpretation of the basic theme of a man's slow, inexorable descent into howling madness.Kubrick's trademarks are all here the clinical, nearly static camera work (until the final whirlwind sequence, when Jack's mind is completely unhinged), the slow, deliberate pacing, Nicholson's stares of what I call slack-jawed malevolence (which effectively imply the disorder into which his psyche is sinking).The film's few gaffes include the blood flood from the elevator and the charming Scatman Crothers' desperate rush to the Overlook through a terrible blizzard to save the Torrances from the hotel's evil, only to get an axe in the chest almost immediately upon reaching his goal.  The film's dark virtues far outweigh these relatively minor quibbles, though.Nicholson has been criticized for an over the top turn as Jack Torrance. I can think of no other actor who could have pulled off his bravura performance of a man, already hounded by the twin demons of  alcoholism and writers block, who slowly (and at first unwillingly) gives himself over to the The Overlook's insidious evil.  When his sanity finally crumbles, Nicholson's magnificently wicked leers and bestial facial expressions (especially when he unfurls those demonic eyebrows) give fascinating face to a fiend at long last set free to destroy.  We all know in our heart of hearts that that same rough beast lurks within us all; some people's control of it is simply weaker than others'.  He does overact, but he pulls it off with such masterful confidence and magnetic panache that is impossible to look away.Small touches of brilliance abound the contradictory feeling of claustophobia in the huge and vacant hotel; the subtle recurring color red throughout the film's sets (implying the bloody ruin to come); the familiar nursery rhymes and pop culture phrases turned on their ears in chilling fashion (Little pigs, little pigs, let me in); the boundless horror on Wendy's face when the spectres of the hotel finally reveal themselves to her during the climax.  There are too many throwaway gems to mention.  The more I see this film (I've seen it probably nine times so far), the more effective it's sense of creeping dread and impending doom resonate.This movie is, in my humble opinion, the Citizen Kane of horror films and deserves every accolade that it has received and more.  It is a dark gem by the greatest American film director.

Dead Alive (Braindead) was the first of his older horror flicks that I got around to watching. After seeing it, I definitely don't think I will be seeing any of the others. There is something sickening about a movie that could very well be one of the goriest films ever made (so it is hailed as by many) that uses its gore for... yes, humor, and not much else. Well, and also to shock. The effects are cheap and amateur, adding to the campy, tacky ridiculousness of the entire ordeal. It seems almost crazy to waste the money and time of those kind of effects though when the intent isnt even to make them scary, it is to make them cheesy and funny. I myself did not find the film very funny. Even though the zombies are very far-fetched, the film seemed to bring this craziness to a normal world, making it slightly unsettling. This is not the intention of the film at all of course, but still, I found certain scenes even disturbing. Such as when Lionel falls through the wall with his mother's corpse in his arms at her funeral. And the embalming scene. Of course it isnt meant to be a real comment on society but it just bothered me. Also, Peter Jackson seems to have a disturbing interest in matricide. What is with this? In the film Heavenly Creatures, based on a true story, Pauline Parker, a fifteen year old girl, murders her mother. After seeing Dead Alive, which was made first (and in it Lionel Cosgrove must kill his zombie mother) I was actually slightly disturbed by the fact that Jackson then went on to do a serious film in which matricide is involved. It actually makes it seem as if there is some perverse interest in it. If it hadnt been for the horror take on this, turning the idea of matricide into a total laughfest, then the interest it wouldn't seem quite so disturbed and twisted. Anyway, if you just love gorey splatterfests that are solely for the sake of fun, is one is for you. If, however, you were looking for anything psychologically stimulating from director Peter Jackson (and if you have a weak stomach), don't look to his older work.

He requests that the police eager to shoot his head off get him Chris (Kevin Spacey), a man he has absolutely no connection with. Why me? he asks Danny. The answer is, more or less, that sometimes the people you don't know are the only ones you can trust. (How's that for a tagline?)Danny's ex-pal, Nate, was suspicious that some cops on the force were stealing money and that guys from the ___ were in on it. So he went to Danny with his story, claiming that he had an informant with evidence of the claim. But when he showed up dead with Danny hovering over his corpse, all blame was shifted on Danny and he was threatened with the prospect of jail, losing his badge and his new wife.So he took the man responsible for his arrest allegations (J.T. Walsh) hostage, as well as some of his acquaintances and an ex-criminal, Rudy (Paul Giamatti), whose sole purpose in the film is to become the comedic relief.Danny suspects that Walsh's character is the guy who set up the killing and had convicting evidence placed in his home. And so he says that he won't surrender until he gets some answers. This is an intriguing premise. Hostage negotiator becomes hostage taker but knows the rules of the game, so he doesn't take any B.S. from the hostage negotiator playing against him. It sounds more confusing than it is. Actually, it's quite simple, and the premise of this would in itself work alone--but it's even got a deeper plot involving corrupt cops going, and that makes it more than just a nice premise.Kevin Spacey (American Beauty) is one of my favorite actors, and once he is introduced close to an hour into the film, he takes charge. But the man who really drives the picture throughout is Samuel L. Jackson, who can turn in great performances and sometimes very weak ones (I heard his character dies in Star Wars III Yippee!). This is one of his all-time best.The film loses in the second half when it starts to become too slow at somewhere around two + hours, but the first half is a blast with a clever idea and some powerhouse performances by both Jackson (in arguably his best role since Pulp Fiction) and Spacey (who shouted great in The Ref and proves here that he can do so under dramatic instances). This is in fact one long shouting match, and I never for a moment doubted any single performance in this film--especially the two lead stars' roles. The film is certainly smarter than a lot of movies I've seen that rely solely on a convenient plot, and it knows how to construct and evoke smart dialogue and interplay between its two great leads.

Since I don't even remember it being in the theaters (though my daughter does), I assumed it was going to be a bit lame.  And if I had read the reviews I've found posted here first, I would have been even MORE hesitant about watching it.                              Instead, I quickly found myself being led into a satirical funny movie, that had me laughing aloud (I'm the type of person that DOES think it's funny to hear chirping birds when Ashley Judd first stares into the smarmy but cute eyes of Greg Kinnear, while the word 'Attraction' is flashed across the screen like a card from a Silent Movie).  I thought Ashley Judd was a great comedienne in this film, especially the scene where she was drunk at the bar.  She plays angry loud drunk female very well.                                    There were also plenty of sight gags.  Am I the only one who laughed at the sight of Hugh Jackman nailing up a blanket over the horrendous hole in the wall in his apartment?  Ashley having to schlep her luggage down the street to her new apartment?  The seating arrangements in the conference room at the workplace, showing the changes in each couple's relationships?  Honest, I laughed at almost every scene in this film.                                          It turns out this movie is based on the book Animal Husbandry, a witty little novella that can be read in a day, which is written like a journal in the life of Jane.  In the book, the character of Eddie remains always intriguing, always fascinating, and always a bit out of reach.  Hugh Jackman attempts to put some of that swagger and inscrutable mystery into his characterization.  It's an intriguing role, and not really an easy one to play, but Hugh as usual does a great job.  His character is emphasized much more in the film than in the book.  Greg Kinnear, as Ray plays it a little too tongue-in-cheek, but the scenes where he's talking to the camera are priceless.  And Ashley Judd plays 'Jane' in a more sympathetic and believable light than the heroine of the novel was portrayed.

They all look like they belong in their roles. Their look and attire fit their characters and when one guy is called Professor so and so or whomever, you believe it unlike many movies in those days where they picked anyone to play the supporting actors.

I realize it was a style of the times but I think they could have given her something a little better to show off her figure when you first meet her.

For all I know, she may have been, when a student at Oxford, the sexy good-time girl portrayed here by Kate Winslet. It is not, however, for either of these things that she is remembered, but rather for what she did during the intervening period when she became one of Britain's leading novelists as well as a philosopher of some distinction.The life of a novelist presents a problem for film makers, greater than the problems of filming the lives of other creative artists. The camera can show us an artist's paintings; we can hear a composer's music on the soundtrack; poems can be read aloud. There is no way in which the essence of a novel can be portrayed on screen in the same way; we just have to take it on trust that so-and-so really is a great writer. This doubtless explains why filmed biographies of writers are uncommon compared with those of painters or musicians; if the Bronte sisters have been something of an exception, that has more to do with the tragedy of their early deaths than with anything they wrote.The director and scriptwriter of this film attempt to solve this problem by avoiding it altogether. The film concentrates entirely on the period in the nineties leading up to Iris's death, intercut with scenes from her student days in the fifties, when she first met her husband John Bayley.

For some reason, I can enjoy a horror movie much more than I can enjoy another film with similar production values, acting, script quality etc... There is something about horror movies that speak to my inner fifteen year old, even ones that aren't that great. When the subject comes up in conversation with my cinema snob peers I get a lot of blank looks, and rolled eyes. I mean could you imagine the look on a peer's face when I start extolling the virtues of this movie while they are discussing when exactly Fellini lost it? Nevertheless, the genre has brought about a few masterpieces. Rosemary's Baby, Repulsion, Psycho, some Cronenberg and a few of the Universal and Hammer movies come to mind. This movie is not a masterpiece but it is an intelligent examination of the relationship between our dreams and reality. Some of the acting is typically hammy, but it's hard to call it cliched when this movie helped invent those cliches. The only movie where Freddy didn't mistake his role of revenge-seeking psychotic for that of a stand up comic. Craven's insistence on using cheap shocks rather than true psychological terror at times prevents this from being a masterpiece but it comes pretty close. This movie spawned several horrible sequels (that still can be entertaining as camp), and one decent one. It wouldn't be until Craven directed an entry in the series again that it would be truly worth our time. An excellent movie overall. 4\/5 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 January 2004","score":"","review":"  The horror genre is a tricky thing for those of us who consider ourselves Cinema buffs.
