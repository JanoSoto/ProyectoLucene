Unfortunately, what I saw when I looked through was neither scary nor entertaining, just revolting.A bad movie in 3D is still a bad movie.  I highly recommend 3D IMAX if you haven't seen it before --- just not this one.

But most of all, it was a strong comment concerning the need to tap into your inner animal and be aggressive in times of trial and\/or tribulation.

The actors try, but they are so hampered by terrible dialogue, a truly dire script and goofy effects, that the whole thing comes over as pure MST3K fodder.The effects are sub-standard. Oh, the CGI in the distance bats are fine, if a little obviously CGI. But it's the close-up, rubber bats that really let the side down. The closer the shot of the bat, the more rubbery and less realistic it looks. As an idea, if you've ever seen the film Ghoulies, then you might have some idea of how un-lifelike and rubbery they look.My favourite bat moment, though, was the bat-cam. Here, they stuck a rubber bat to the front of the camera and run around with it, to show you what an attack looks like from a bat's eye view, as it were. But it's so ludicrous I was laughing my head off.But it's not just the effects that are lame. The plot is too. On the whole, its bearable. But right at the end, it falls flat on its face with the most awful and glaringly obvious screw up on the part of the scriptwriters\/cutting crew et al.The script is so full of cliche horror moments its unreal. Top of the list are the beautiful heroine and comedy side-kick. Also present is the evil scientist out to protect his creations, which ultimately turn on him. Ho hum. We also have the disbelieving populace (until its too late!). The hard-nosed kill 'em all military man. The list just goes on and on.Among the many stupidities that the cast are called upon to perform in the name of the script is the holing up in the town school so that they can track the bats by satellite. Apparently, they couldn't do this from a safe location, far from the bats, as this wouldn't have meant an attack by the bats for dramatic effect. As a further idiocy, the back-up generator is installed far from the control room, allowing for a panicked run to start it up when the bats short out the power. Furthermore, its a pullcord starter, so that the heroes have trouble getting it going, to further enhance the already non-existent tension.But the best bit is saved for last.You see, spoilers, they find the bats are holed up in an abandoned mine (now isn't that original). The military sends a team up there and lowers a truck-sized refrigeration unit into the mine on a long cable. The idea is to chill the bats and make them go ni-nights. However, the bats return (did I mention the soldiers do this at night?) and slaughter the lot of them. Enter our heroes, who turn up next day to finish the job. Except......they go into the mine through some convoluted passageways and an elevator barely big enough for the two of them. At this point, not having seen the military actually lowering the freezer into the mine, I was wondering how they got something that size down all these twisty passages, especially since we'd been told (several times) that there was only one entrance to the mine. Anyhow, after some time our heroes enter the bat cavern and, guess what? There's the freezer unit, dangling from a big hole in the roof on the end of a cable. At this point I was scowling at the stupidity of it all. Why didn't our heroes merely go down through the roof where the freezer was? Of course, the answer was that the scriptwriters are stupid, stupid people who believe we won't notice such an awful screw-up. To add insult to injury, after escaping from the bat lair, our heroes blow the entrance to seal the mine and the bats inside.

Oh, the CGI in the distance bats are fine, if a little obviously CGI. But it's the close-up, rubber bats that really let the side down. The closer the shot of the bat, the more rubbery and less realistic it looks. As an idea, if you've ever seen the film Ghoulies, then you might have some idea of how un-lifelike and rubbery they look.My favourite bat moment, though, was the bat-cam. Here, they stuck a rubber bat to the front of the camera and run around with it, to show you what an attack looks like from a bat's eye view, as it were. But it's so ludicrous I was laughing my head off.But it's not just the effects that are lame. The plot is too. On the whole, its bearable.

Apparently, they couldn't do this from a safe location, far from the bats, as this wouldn't have meant an attack by the bats for dramatic effect. As a further idiocy, the back-up generator is installed far from the control room, allowing for a panicked run to start it up when the bats short out the power. Furthermore, its a pullcord starter, so that the heroes have trouble getting it going, to further enhance the already non-existent tension.But the best bit is saved for last.You see, spoilers, they find the bats are holed up in an abandoned mine (now isn't that original). The military sends a team up there and lowers a truck-sized refrigeration unit into the mine on a long cable. The idea is to chill the bats and make them go ni-nights. However, the bats return (did I mention the soldiers do this at night?) and slaughter the lot of them. Enter our heroes, who turn up next day to finish the job.

At this point, not having seen the military actually lowering the freezer into the mine, I was wondering how they got something that size down all these twisty passages, especially since we'd been told (several times) that there was only one entrance to the mine. Anyhow, after some time our heroes enter the bat cavern and, guess what? There's the freezer unit, dangling from a big hole in the roof on the end of a cable. At this point I was scowling at the stupidity of it all. Why didn't our heroes merely go down through the roof where the freezer was? Of course, the answer was that the scriptwriters are stupid, stupid people who believe we won't notice such an awful screw-up.

It does have the same kind of formula as the orginal Grease but is dealt with in a completely different way. Danny faniced Sandy back, but Stephanie (played by the young Michelle Pfhieffer) doesn't even give Michael (Caulfield) a second glance.  Also, instead of cars, a motorbike is the new 'thing' to have.Michael Carrington, a straight A student from England, transfers to Rydell High and is immediately put into the 'nerd' category and the T-Birds brand him 'Shakesphere'.  He is smart, extremely uncool and very shy.Stephenie, the leader of the Pink ladies has come back from the summer holidays having broke up with Johnny, the T-Birds leader, having grown out of him.  Johnny is clearly still interested in Stephanie but she doesn't want to know.  Her loyalty to the Birds has faltered as she wants someone even cooler.First day back Stephanie sees the Birds picking on Michael and defends him, from that moment on Michael vows to become a T-Bird and win her heart.So there is the story, but what Grease is famous for is the memorable songs, and this film has them!  There are 12 songs on the soundtrack and there isn't one that I really skip.  The music has changed since the first Grease as it was made in the decade of the 80's.  Its early 80's rock that you are getting yourself into for the most part.  You have the romanitc songs (Turn Back The Hands Of Time, We'll Be Together, Charades), the heavy rock songs (Cool Rider, Who's That Guy), the happy-go-dancing songs (Score Tonight, Back To School), the sweet songs (Love For All Seasons) and the down right silly songs (Reproduction, Prowlin').  These are all songs that stick in your mind and just can't stop singing them to yourself.  All the songs are quality and stand on their own.  Absolutely brilliant soundtrack.What would Grease be without the classic characters?  We have the T-Birds who are actually not cool in any way or form, its only the leader (Johnny) who is 'cool', the others just follow his lead.  Johnny is a classic character who makes you laugh over and over again, its hilarious whenever he loses his cool.  Frenchy unfortunately doesn't have a big part in the film but nethertheless she is there.  The coach is back but you only see him twice if that.  Mrs Mcgee and Blanche are also back making quite a funny duo as they did last time.  Two new teachers; a very sexy female who always has low cut tops on and pays $500 for her hair (according to the cheer leading twins).  She falls for the unlikely nerdy substitute teacher, Mr Stewart, who teaches the immortal 'Reproduction' lesson.  The new Pink ladies have very distinctive characters, one of them is obsessed with her nose and doesnt come into it much (Rhonda), Paulette is somewhat the second leader in my view who has a crush on Johnny, she does have her own intentions but she does care for her friends; nothing like Riz.  Sharon is a bubbly flirty character who is the prey of one of the T-Birds (Louis) to get into bed. Then there is Dolores, Paulettes little sister who isn't a Pink lady but a pink lady mascot, she looks about 12, mouthy and carries a skate board everywhere.The performances were actually very good in my humble opinion, especially Max Caulfield who seemed very uncomfortable... and that is the way Michael is supposed to be!  He wins me over with those puppy innocent eyes, then when he is the mysterious guy he acts completely cool.  Max was a triumph. His voice isn't the best thing in the world but he didn't sing that much anyway.  Michelle Pfhieffer was wonderful as an actress and singer.  When you hear her sing you won't need to wonder why Andrew Lloyd Webber wanted her as Evita in his film musical and NOT Madonna.  She shines in 'Cool Rider'.  The whole cast was believable.  I normally sit back in films and watch peoples performances and dig at them but I didnt do that at all in this movie.This film has a lot of negative feedback as every one compares it to the Original Grease.  My opinion isnt common, preferring this one to the original, therefore my advice to you is to forget the first movie when watching this one.  It needs a chance!

I strongly disagree. I think the film is perfect.I saw Stalag 17 in 1954 at age seven, with my late uncle. He was shot down over Germany in 1944 and spent 14 months in Stalag Luft I (Barth, Germany). He said the film was an accurate depiction of kriegie life.When I was a teenager he and I discussed the film and both agreed it was excellent. Yes, there was much suffering and death in POW camps. But he said there was humor as well. In fact, it was the only way he maintained his sanity. His POW Log (a hard cover diary type book with blank pages for writing and drawing, donated to POWs by the International Red Cross) contained many tales of POW hi-jinks and other funny stories, so I think that aspect of the movie was on target.American and British POWs viewed escape as both a serious endeavor and a game to outwit the Germans. The Air Force Museum in Dayton, Ohio has a display devoted to Luftwaffe POW camps and displays one German poster from 1944-45 that declared Escape activity is no longer considered a game and POWs attempting to escape will be shot, so it appears that, at least up to the last year of the war, both sides saw escape activity as a test of will and competition. It also reduced boredom, on both sides.Viewing this film, one should remember the Luftwaffe considered allied airmen to be brothers of sorts and gave them better treatment than other POWs received. And they certainly treated military prisoners much better than civilians in concentration camps. On the other hand, the Japanese were extremely brutal to all prisoners. An excellent film about Japanese POW Camps is 1965's adaptation of James Clavelle's book King Rat, with George Segal, who also plays a character like Sefton. Clavelle also co-wrote the screenplay for The Great Escape.Stalag 17 is well paced and the characters fully developed. William Holden is perfect as Sefton. I think he was probably the first film anti-hero; a role he played throughout his acting career (Bridge on the River Kwai; The Bridges at Toko-Ri). Sefton wasn't a collaborator. He just traded sharper than other guys. And of course he ran lucrative floating games of chance and a black market operation.Neville Brand shines as a tough POW who hates Sefton and leads a group who give him a 'blanket party' one night. Shapiro and 'Animal' are classic clowns and foul ups who continuously provide hilarious comedy relief. Otto Preminger is nothing short of superb as the arrogant Prussian who was transferred from the cavalry to be a POW camp warden. His daily diatribes to the sergeants are priceless. Schultz is exactly what we expect, a mindless boob. Clearly, the TV series Hogan's Heroes' Sergeant Schultz was based on him. By the way, my uncle and I both thought Hogan's Heroes was absolute trash and an insult to all POWs.POSSIBLE SPOILER The best surprise in the entire movie is the discovery of the stool pigeon. We never expect Peter Grave's character, Sgt. Price, to be the English speaking German masquerading as an American in order to rat out the POWs' escape plans. It is poetic justice that after Sefton is beaten up because the guys in his hut think he's the stoolie, he is the one who catches Price. 'Pricehoffer' (Graves) is gunned down by his own soldaten, when he is tied up and noisily thrown out into the yard as a decoy the night Sefton and Lt. Dunbar escape.In the end, Sefton does the right thing and clearly redeems himself. He uses an inner courage we didn't think he had to help LT Dunbar escape before he's turned over to the Gestapo as a saboteur. But then Sefton does do it for a reward from Dunbar's rich family, so he's still playing the angles up to the end.This is one of the best films about WW II.

I find even Brando's acting in these movies below his normal standards.And let me tell you why many people like these mafia movies so much it's just because many people secretly in their heart admire and envy the wild & free life style of the gangsters. Just the same reason why Bonnie & Clyde etc. are so popular. Or youngsters love to read the Nicky Cruz biography Run, baby, run because they find the violent & brutal life of the young gangsters exciting and fascinating, blindly ignoring the fact that the author's message is totally against that.

I find even Brando's acting in these movies below his normal standards.And let me tell you why many people like these mafia movies so much it's just because many people secretly in their heart admire and envy the wild & free life style of the gangsters. Just the same reason why Bonnie & Clyde etc. are so popular. Or youngsters love to read the Nicky Cruz biography Run, baby, run because they find the violent & brutal life of the young gangsters exciting and fascinating, blindly ignoring the fact that the author's message is totally against that. Sadly, it is often the same with movies. You think Quentin Tarantino is so popular among the masses because of his artistic merits? You think wrong.
