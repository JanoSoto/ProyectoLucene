I am (maybe) a little old to have been captured by it (I was in my 20's when it was released), but having seen it a couple of times I can see why it got the following it did. The first time was on TV and it was a version that had been cut back quite a bit to allow a daytime showing. This didn't really work (for me) and so I got the DVD which has a much better, uncut, version of the film. I will give you my thoughts after this brief summary.The Goonies are a bunch of kids who live in Astoria. They are; Mikey, Mouth, Chunk and Data, joined on this particular adventure by Mikey's brother, Brand, and two girls, Andy and Stef. All of their houses are under threat of foreclosure as the local country club looks to expand. None of the families can afford to stay and it looks like they are all going to have to move away. On their last day the boys are messing about in Mikey's dad's attic when they find an old pirate treasure map. Mikey is a bit of a dreamer and persuades the others to go looking for the treasure. Throw in a criminal family, the Fratelli's, and you got yourself an adventure you just won't believe! I'll leave it there or the Spoiler Police (pirate division) will have me walking the plank again.Beautifully made with some excellent special effects (remember, no CGI back then) and a great score, it's great to look at. All the kids did an excellent job; Sean Astin as Mikey, Josh Brolin as Brand, Jeff Cohen as Chunk, Corey Feldman as Mouth, Kerri Green as Andy, Martha Plimpton as Stef and Jonathan Ke Quan as Data. The Fratelli's were also pretty good, so honourable mentions go to; John Matuszak as Sloth, Robert Davi as Jake, Joe Pantoliano as Francis and Anne Ramsey as Mama.With a story by Steven Spielberg and having been made very much in his style, I can definitely see the appeal. The dialogue and the style put me very much in mind of the old 1930's black and white comedies that featured kids as the main characters. Don't ask me to name any of them, I lost those brain cells many years ago. If anything, I did find it a little too long and some of the jokes did tend to get a bit tired towards the end. Having said that though, it's still a fine film and well worth a look if you happen to come across it&#x85; Recommended.My Score 8.1\/10.IMDb Score 7.5\/10 (based on 74,589 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score 63\/100 (based on 41 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

Not gonna happen. Even if you are a pacifist piece of crap like the Captain, you have to keep your unit cohesive.Tanks enter a hot zone in a city without firing a shot. Stupid.

I waited for him to say 104. That would have been believable, but I guess this Captain was leading a battalion, not a company. And somehow, he ends up leading not a battalion, not a company, not a platoon, but a mere squad.

Uh, no.If you have a prisoner, you let him go while you dig graves. No, to letting him go. No, to digging graves during battle. You take care of the living first; and of the living, you take care of your own men first.Although communication was atrocious, all platoons had a radioman, and some squads did. The proper place for a radioman is two feet to the rear of the Captain at all times.The horrid portrayal of the American fighting man goes on and on. They weren't wimps. Yes, everyone was scared silly, but they didn't challenge every fricking order. If you are part of the 10% of the Army known as line soldiers, the chances are good that you are not coming back.

He proved himself so many times in dramas, he is so great actor.This time, there is no grade for the script, 10 is too low, maybe 10++ would suffice. I must agree that in everything around us we can see only what we are capable to see, but this movie gives so many levels and many people would see it differently and ALL WILL BE THRILLED by this movie.People who are interested in the phenomenon of 'Big Brother',a kind of TV voyeurism (so present today) will see the ultimate human desire to observe somebody's life, from its beginning, and without consent of the person which is the object of that observing. There is nothing special in this man who is watched, but we like to have mirrors of our lives in other people (who knows why). Of course, the next layer is ethical do we have the right to watch somebody's life, because we don't talk about a rat, but a human being who doesn't know that he is watched in a TV show. If we go further, we must ask ourselves, what is real in our life? There is is always some possibility that we are observed, directed, guided, monitored..., by somebody and our life is not so authentic as we used to think.Next layer this movie talks about freedom and personal choice. How we want to be free, no matter what are the other alternatives are. Free to love who we want, free to go, free as much as it is possible. Of course, if we want to be free, if our mind and society stop us.FINALLY... The most interesting level is the spiritual one.This is a guidebook of the spiritual path. At first, this world is so secure and predictable place. We have our little lives and we can define everything what is important for us, to have some simplification of reality, to feel safe. This kind of ordinary life is a bit boring, but we are in a herd, we are not alone in our dungeon.But..., at some moment, this world is maybe not what we thought it is..., maybe we want more of our lives,and the world is not so simple and ordinary place. We feel that there is something BEHIND this so- called 'reality'. And we start to search, to test that reality, which gives us more and more 'magic' things as we go deeper. This is still a stage of curiosity, many people tasted this path and feeling, but at some superficial level.If we go further, we must fight the world. All possible obstacles will arise, people and circumstances. When Truman wants to see reality what it is, to be free, all his 'friends' and the complete crew don't let him to go our the ordinary tracks. So alike the spiritual quest. Then, the moment has come, men must be separated from boys, that is, the curious people from the real seekers.

To begin with, movie titles like this perplex me. Who is Max Keeble, why is he being introduced abruptly, and why is his move film worthy? It's always a hit or miss state when you get a movie named after a character you never heard of before. But not just a movie named after an unknown character, but with a film title like this you'd expect to have some acquaintance with the title character before. It's stating he is making a big move, so you'd assume that with a prior introduction you'd have some essence to what that big move might be.Upon seeing this advertised years ago I had a thought in the back of my mind that if the film would become very successful Max Keeble would be the next character to have his very own Television show. By watching the film, that almost appears that is what they were going for. It has a Disney Channel vibe to it that's difficult to explain. It's corny, awkward in places, uninspired, and appears to be colored in with a crayon.But this isn't the film for me. While I grew up around the time of this film and tend to enjoy childhood nostalgia, take my review of Good Burger for example, I couldn't find much use for this. It's odd and out of place. It tells the journey of a tween named Max Keeble (Linz) who is entering the dreaded middle school with his friends Robe (Peck) and Megan (Grey).Max learns that his favorite animal shelter he helps out at is closing, bullies at school only grow meaner when the grade gets higher, his corrupt Principal Jindrake (Miller) is up to no good, and the ice cream man won't stop harassing children.Man, Max has a ton on his plate. And on top of that he may be moving to Chicago and he desperately wants to win the heart of a Freshman girl who is carelessly ripped from other better kids films.This is another one of those teenage films where the lead character treats middle school like the depths of hell. While I hated middle school, and it frustrated me beyond belief, I should be grateful for the fact that I didn't go through the harassment and stress that Max did. For God's sakes they don't even show the amount of homework he must get too. Fifth grade to sixth is a big jump in terms of workload, and not obligatory, over-dramatic situations.Will the target audience enjoy it? Probably so, fourth, fifth, and sixth grade to be exact. Will older kids like it? If they grew up with it, yes. Will adults like it? Pretty unlikely. Max Keeble's Big Move is truly harmless, but redundant, and at a mere eighty-six minutes it doesn't capture the big move too well as much as it captures ones chaotic, over-exaggerated journey through middle school.One last thought; I always wondered if movie characters are aware of other films.

They believe that they alone are the center of the universe and everyone and everything that comes in contact with them exist for their own personal benefit and enjoyment. This isn't exactly the idea behind The Truman Show, but it was close, as Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) was born and raised as a corporate entity and marketed to the world as the central character of a thirty year old, twenty four hour a day living soap opera. I guess the picture did the best job it could of providing the viewer with the rationale needed to make this concept work, like throwing up roadblocks in Truman's youth to steer him to certain conclusions about life and it's limitations. On closer examination however, some of those foundations begin to crumble. One of the biggest plot holes for me involved Truman's marriage to Meryl (Laura Linney). Even though presented with a simulated wedding photo showing Meryl's fingers crossed, my thoughts proceeded to the honeymoon and the consummation of their marriage. How did Truman rationalize beyond that point to where the story picks up for us? Still, in an age of realty TV and celebrity 'This and That With the Stars', it was probably only a matter of time before a subject like this was tackled for a provocative film treatment. I wouldn't put it past any large corporation on the scale, say of Exxon Mobil or General Electric, to jump the shark and participate in something as totally over the top as The Truman Show. And sadly, I see no small amount of willing participants eager to sell their souls for a brief moment of fame, glory and wealth. Why I'll bet there's someone out there who would be willing to stage an elaborate high profile courtship, plan a big expensive wedding, and then get divorced after only seventy two days. I'm just saying.

Growing up in a country where whatever knowledge I had of Christmas and Halloween came from American TV, I missed a lot of the jokes and a lot of the references, but I enjoyed the colorful characters, zany adventure and dark slapstick. I loved it.I watched it again when I was 16 and going to art school, during a lecture about adult animation. This time I enjoyed the stylish design, the meticulously made stop-motion animation and the infectious songs. Loved it.And I watched it for a third time when I was 22 and studying design. I now knew the careers of both Henry Selick and Tim Burton back to front, and could appreciate just how much of a landmark the film was for both of them. I could also appreciate the subtle pokes at American culture, and the clever homage to both classic animated Christmas specials and German expressionist cinema. Loved it.I now tend to watch The Nightmare Before Christmas approximately once a year. It's not a tradition or anything, I still don't celebrate Christmas or Halloween. There just always seems to be some good reason to watch it, as it's one of the shortest, quickest, and most enjoyable of my all time favorite films. And I enjoy it every time. It's wildly imaginative, beautifully animated in stop-motion animation that isn't likely to age any time soon, gorgeously designed and wonderfully scored. It refused to acknowledge the idea that an animated film has to make a choice between kids' and adults' animation; it's directed at mature and intelligent kids, and at young-at-heart adults, two years before Pixar started making films that made the same choice.Most of all, The Nightmare Before Christmas remains one of a kind. Burton tried to recreate the magic with Corpse Bride and failed miserably. It's funny, it's filled with sarcasm but also surprisingly touching and idealistic.

Basically in San Francisco lives devout Catholic, jazz music loving and saxophone playing Harry Caul (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Gene Hackman), who also owns and operates a surveillance business with his highly professional equipment to capture sound. In his personal and professional life he is highly private and solitary, and this does concern his partner Stan (The Godfather's John Cazale) who feels left out of the work done by the business. Harry is so private he never lets anyone else into his apartment, and he does not have a telephone and calls all his clients from pay phones, this is to keep control of what is going on around him. His and Stan's latest assignment is to record, to anyone else normal, a conversation between a male\/female couple meeting each other in Union Square, which is very crowded and noisy. The client, known only as the director, wants them to take photographs and record all audio from the closely observed conversation, and give them only to him in exchange for payment. Listening to every word in the every word of the pair, Ann (Cindy Williams) and Mark (Frederic Forrest), Harry believes that they are in danger, from the circumstances of the director's assistant Martin Stett (Harrison Ford). He does not normally become attached to any of the words that people on his recordings say, but he has become concerned since the deaths of three people as a result from his previous audio recordings from another job. Harry has to decide whether or not to hand over the recordings, and photos, to the director, and whether or not he could save the couple who always meet in the same place, using the information he has collected. He eventually meets The Director (Robert Duvall) in person, and he decides to follow Ann and Mark to a hotel, and he tries to listen in on their discussions with any surveillance technique available to him, and it turns out that it was in fact a murder they were talking about committing. In the end Harry discovers that because of his work his apartment has been bugged, and he frantically searches for listening devices, removing floorboards and tearing up the walls, and after failing to find one all he can do is sit alone and play his saxophone. Also starring Allen Garfield as Bernie Moran, Michael Higgins as Paul, Elizabeth MacRae as Meredith and Teri Garr as Amy. Hackman gives an excellent performance as the obsessive character as the loner with surveillance expertise, the supporting actors such as Ford and Duvall do well with their time as well, the rewinding and forwarding of the conversation of the title is fascinating with the sound being broken down and edited to hear every word and grip you to see what Hackman does next, and the surreal paranoia and high observation themes make for fantastic plot line, it is a very clever psychological thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Picture for Coppola, Best Sound and Best Writing, Original Screenplay for Coppola, it won the BAFTA for Best Film Editing and Best Sound Track, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay.

This film is well worth watching by a wide range of people. For those sensitive to violence and bare body moments there is nothing gratuitous with the normal level of both for that genre . Some of the sexual references are, like the one raised by a child at the end, really funny serious moments.

It's an exercise in mature and honest filmmaking, and every actor and actress is blessed by the great material they've been handed.The film tells the sad but heart-warming coming of age parable, taking place in the 1960's, of a young woman named Beverly Donofrio (Barrymore) who becomes a mother at the tender age of fifteen, gets married to the loser she can barely look at by the end of the film named Ray (Zahn), and tries to stay in school to secure her life. The story is true and is taken from the autobiography of the same name.Beverly is likable, but desperate, and there are many situations she gets involved in that could label her a bad mother. Frequently in the film I imagined the characters were sitting around a poker table and Beverly was dealt the worst of the hands. She plays them, hoping to score, but inevitably, risks are taken and her luck turns sour. She is ambitious and willing to win the pot, but she can't make a whole lot of the cards she has but to play them and hopefully upgrade them for some bigger ones.Her parents are played extraordinarily by James Woods, giving a performance just as good as he did as the pimp Lester Diamond in Casino, and Lorraine Bracco who does her best to pursue and cope with her daughter's hefty decisions.Beverly and Ray are with each other because they have to be. Are they in love? No, it's more of a mutual liking between them. They don't hate each other, although shadows of extreme disgust and dislike begin to show further in the story. They're with each other because if not, she'd be a tramp and he'd be a deadbeat scumbag. This depicts the time in the world where men stepped up and made attempts to father the child they mistakingly brought into the world. And the women turn to her books and schoolwork as much as she could if impregnated at a young age. Now, when a woman is pregnant, before she calls her boyfriend, she tries to secure a deal with MTV.The supporting work doesn't just stem from Woods and Bracco. It's everywhere. Brittany Murphy gives one of the best performances of her career as Fay, Bev's best friend who also is attempting to bring up a kid in this world. She is raising a girl named Amelia, while Bev is bringing up a boy named Jason. The young, vibrant romance between the two youths is woefully under-developed and that is one thing the film should've been dripping with.Steve Zahn is captivating as well. He's an actor that can play virtually anyone. A screw up brother in one of my favorite horror films, a goofball father, a drugged out loser, and an idiot backup to Jack Black and Jason Biggs.One other minor complaint is the fact that at some points the film feels more considered with reenacting the nostalgia of the sixties than actually developing the story or advancing it. Sure, the beautiful set pieces and photography compliment the script, but the overall pictorial aspect could've been ignored to focus more on the realism of the events. The Vietnam War is mentioned, and many other elements of the sixties, all of which are used very attentively and properly. Not gratuitously.Drew Barrymore is simply convincing and enigmatic as Beverly. She puts herself in the role of this desperate woman who frequently feels as if she needs to father her son and her husband. Her performance reminds me greatly of Natalie Portman's in Where the Heart Is. There's a depressing work of art, but both performances are so enigmatic and delightful that they shine a ray of sun on a plot so grim at some points. Barrymore portrays the struggles of a woman of the time period in a way that is very difficult to accomplish. She nails it with stunning honesty and piercing accuracy in her emotional struggles.And that's the keyword here; honesty. This film is genuine, and not sugarcoated. Life can seriously suck sometimes. The film makes no attempt to hide that. The things Riding in Cars With Boys is astounding and nonetheless memorable. It's a tender film with so much to show other than being a great coming of age drama. With the way it's filmed, acted, and written I'm shocked none of the credits read Rob Reiner.
