There are absolutely NO effects here --- just three young people running for their lives, holding cameras.

The first 40 minutes or so were practically unwatchable but from then onwards there were a few nice moments and lines here and there. Fairly abruptly, Buffy went from being an unfunny and completely unlikeable version of Cordelia to something resembling the TV (i.e. proper) version of the character in the show's early days, minus the wit. Some elements of the plot are later recycled in the TV series' pilot episodes Welcome to the Hellmouth and The Harvest and done much more effectively to boot. I know that Joss Whedon hates the unaired Buffy pilot but even that is better than the film as it at least represents a step in the right direction. It's hard to believe that the film came out only five years before the series as it has dated horribly. It seems more like the early 1980s than the early 1990s. With the exception of I, Robot...You Jane and its quaint Internet malarkey, I don't think that the series has dated - or carbon dated, as Buffy would say - one iota.The film is only 85 minutes long but seems like an eternity especially since the acting certainly isn't anything to write home about. Kristy Swanson and even Luke Perry are okay, if not the most appealing leads in the world. Donald Sutherland is sort of listless whereas Rutger Hauer, Paul Reubens (who should really stick to playing Pee Wee Herman) and David Arquette were horribly over the top. Sutherland and Hauer usually turn in great performances but not here. Hilary Swank is effective enough as Buffy's airhead friend Kimberley, which in fairness is not a terribly demanding role, but she still had a long, long way to go before she was Oscar worthy, needless to say. The brief appearance by Ben Affleck caught me by surprise. Seth Green, who played a vampire in the movie but his scenes were cut, is one of only two actors to appear in both the film and the television series, Chi Muoi Lo being the other. You can apparently see Green for three seconds outside the gym towards the end of the film but I didn't catch him and I was looking out for him.After the television series was made, Whedon said that he had envisaged the film as being a scary one about female empowerment - as we all know, there's nothing scarier than female empowerment - but the Kuzuis turned it into a pop culture comedy about how people viewed vampires. To put it mildly, I prefer Whedon's vision. The premise of the film, as the television series proved five years later, is a belter but it was handled terribly here. Last month, I read The Origin, a comic which basically brings Whedon's original script to life in the context of the series, and it was considerably better in spite of the fact that it followed the same basic storyline. It just had more energy than the film and obviously fit in better with the television series than the film which, like Sutherland's performance, is fairly listless and uninspiring. It picks up steam in the last 20 minutes to a certain extent but it's only worth watching if you're curious to see how the TV series could have gotten more or less everything wrong at the get go.Whereas the creators of Stargate SG-1 built on the relative success, good ideas and potential of the original Stargate film (which they had nothing to do with), Whedon more or less disregarded the final version of the film entirely in favour of his original script and his original intentions. Not only was that the right decision for him as a creative person but the right decision for us as the audience.

What makes it fail is its target audience - what was this movie actually geared towards? Kids?... From what I have seen the movie fails to even appeal to a single kid, as kids really enjoy political disputes in such times of turbulence; do you think kids even give a monkeys about a blockade stopping trade routes to Naboo? Even though the movie contradicts the fact that they're against Naboo and want to destroy it notwithstanding that, even though all Naboo have is an imperial(played by the great Brian Blessed) living underneath a dome in the water.Is the movie for Adults? Well, not really... Jar Jar, to exemplify, is family friendly; however, he is an unwholesome brute, who is superficial and has the grimace and voice of an African-esque figure; perhaps not coincidental as he is a slave to the Gungans and Boss Nass, so Lucas gets trumped there. Yes adult debates take place, but it falls under a really pimped out kids movie; you got the young whipper snapper Anakin (Played by Jake Lloyd) who is the remarkable young man with a special forte for manufacturing pods, he is a nuisance. Who is this movie for? Star Wars fans absolutely went to the streets with it. Do you know what the movie was geared towards? Profiteering in the hope that this coverage could prove George Lucas has got this miraculous talent and that it only lies as an undercurrent; true art shouldn't need to be thought of through marketing. Eye candy? Yes, it is Eye Candy, but so are many other Sci-Fi movies like Blade Runner (1984), Alien (1978), one of my favorite directors 2001 A Space Odyssey (1968) while they're not intrinsically eye candy, they're visually impressive... heck, even Black Lagoon was visually impressive and so was Forbidden Planet... what distinguishes it from these movies? The fact that the movie is not even visually pleasing. Eye candy is quite derogatory, however, but the word hyphen basically indicates that it's attractive, yet not interesting a tall; this movie is not even attractive; it's a hodgepodge of disjointed cutscenes.The movie only resonated with me in the vignette of Duel of the Fates in which the chopped up, orchestrated ensemble fight against Maul with Qui Gon and Obi Wan happens; Palpatine (Darth Sidious played by Ian McDiarmid) doesn't fight them because he knows in folklore the good guy always triumphs? Heck, if he was there, Obi Wan would have been potentially killed and it would have stopped the string of sequels... However, the potential of death wasn't even present here. I was 5 years old when this movie was launched into the mainstream theater.

After seeing all the bad reviews, I was a bit sadden but still tried to keep an open mind. I definitely can see why this movie can suck but I didn't think it was that bad.Acting was obviously not that great but it didn't ruin the movie for me. Added with the less than spectacular dialogue and script, I can see why it is a shoe-in for the worst movie ever award. Everyone on the cast could have used an acting coach. The dialogue didn't flow and often time feels out of place. The biggest issue I think for this movie would be the script\/story.As a fan that watched the cartoon, I knew what was going to happen. This movie isn't even two hours and it tried to fit months(or hours depending how you look at it) of story telling into 1hr and 43mins. The story was so rushed to the point where you can't immerse yourself into the world. I think Roddenson's biggest mistake is changing things that needn't be changed.There's a lot of things I like about this movie. I like the depiction of all the races even with the minor changes(new ridge on the brow, etc). I felt blending was adequate in the movie and enjoyed the action sequences though I was disappointed for no creature at the end. I like how they tried to keep the lightheartedness of Data and should have done more of that. I liked how the flashbacks were done as I didn't feel to distracted by it. The movie should really have been 45mins longer to adequately give it the necessary buildup and connections.I'm not going to say this was a great movie but it kept me entertained enough. People with race concerns need to take a step back. The movie can't be a complete adaptation. Don't ignore that fact that there's more shades of skin color in this movie than anything else out right now.Final verdict the movie isn't great but still good enough to entertain.

Director John Landis managed one of those movies where everything just came together and almost everything is right with this. The premise of An American Werewolf In London is obvious from the title. And, yes, a lot of werewolf movies have been made - before and after this one. So, sure, you'd wonder how another one could be fresh or rise above the rest, but this one managed the trick. It is the perfect combination of a very frightening movie, a very graphic and bloody movie and a very funny movie. At times you'll be jumping and almost wanting to put your hands over your eyes, and then five minutes later you'll be chuckling at something. It's all there, and woven together just perfectly. And out of all the werewolf movies I've seen (and I love the genre, so I've seen a lot) I think this one has the absolute best transformation scene ever put together.The cast was superb. David Naughton as the unfortunate David Kessler, who gets bitten by a werewolf and is of course cursed to become a werewolf. The little known (at least to me) and very lovely British actress Jenny Agutter was perfect as Alex, David's nurse who lets him move in with her after he's released from the hospital. There's really no weaknesses in any of the supporting cast, either. The relationship between David and Alex was one minor issue. It happened too fast to be truly believable. The plot mechanism of having David's dead friend Jack who had been killed by the werewolf that bit David (played by Griffin Dunne) appear to him and warn him about what was going to happen worked for a while but became a bit tired by the end. This very fast paced movie also ended a bit too abruptly for my liking, although there was a pretty good romp of devastation by the werewolf through Piccadilly.

The lives of the people in the snow covered hill villages of Afghanistan are as inviolable in the eyes of almighty God as our own. How quickly we forget the lessons of our past.

Multiple sets on camera in the same frame and still not confusing or disjointed.It is also one of his most funny and entertaining pieces and that is another accomplishment given the dark subject matter. It could have been a morbid and nauseating film with the wrong tone but, he keeps it light and still doesn't lose a lick of the tension.There are so many scenes here that are aces but one favorite is when Jeffries' detective friend visits him to tell him that he is wrong in suspecting foul play. Several things goes on in the scene at once and it is so well written. The looks that Stewart and Corey give each other are priceless.Thelma Ritter as the nurse is brilliant and it's a shame that she wasn't really acknowledged more for the part. Grace Kelly was excruciatingly beautiful but you couldn't really see her as much more than that. She stopped acting before she developed into an accomplished actor. Her best scene is at the beginning when she realises that Stewart won't marry her.The best part is of course played by Raymond Burr and as was intended, he does resemble David Selznick. It almost creepy how much he looks like Hitchcock's boss. I wonder how Selznick took it. It is a very difficult part too, virtually silent and incredibly menacing.You could go on and on about the meaning of the whole thing. One thing comes to mind, though. This is a movie that virtually defines what a movie is. Perceptions, reactions, conclusions and all that defines great art. It's all here.

I think they set a world record for how many times the main character's name is mentioned throughout the movie.The plot is standard sequel stuff Carol Anne, the little girl plagued by paranormal phenomena in the first two movies, now stays with her bitchy aunt and her husband and daughter in a huge Chicago high rise building. Unfortunately for everyone, some prick counselor at her new school has been putting her under hypnosis to deal with the events of her past (he believes she has the power to produce mass hallucinations and is a manipulative liar despite witnessing paranormal activity in her presence--smart man). This therapy apparently opens her up and leaves her vulnerable to Kane, the preacher that wants her to lead them to the other side. Kane shows up in mirrors and other reflective surfaces (like puddles) and uses them to attack.I've never seen so many mirrors in one movie. Even Carol Anne's bedroom walls are just big mirrors (I guess she hasn't hit that self-conscious stage yet). The hallways are mirrored. The elevators--mirrored. The poor girl has to go to the parking garage just to get away from all of the damn mirrors and it still doesn't end well for her.There is some mildly entertaining subplot involving Lara Flynn Boyle's character, Donna, and her love interest with really bad '80s hair sneaking their friends into the building's pool after-hours. If you enjoy watching bad '80s fashion, you'll love these guys.Once Kane starts to attack, Tangina, the short lady with the grating voice, comes back to help Carol Anne and her new family.The movie manages to be pretty creepy by utilizing its inspired location--the building is often genuinely menacing. The mirror effects make up for some pretty corny dialogue and the characters' tendency to yell Carol Anne! every other minute.Could have been much better if the script was worked on, but as-is, it's just a formulaic sequel with some average acting. Entertaining enough for a watch if you're not expecting anything close to the original.

I was a kid growing up in the Mother Lode country of California's Sierra Nevadas, where they have their own lost gold legends, and have actually worked for the past few years on microwave radio sites in New Mexico, including the area of Reserve, Quemado, Datil and Magdalena where the Lost Adams Mine legends are said to be located. I'm also a Brother of Equal Indignity of the Ancient & Honorable Order of E Clampus Vitus, A 170-year-old Historical society with roots in the Mother Lode. So, I'm always interested in gold mining stories from the Old West.I had seen this movie as a kid not long after it first came out, probably for Julie Newmar's nude scene more than anything else, and liked it then despite it's more hokey elements. Since then, I grew up and actually worked in areas of the Jicarilla, Mescalero, White Mountain and Chiricahua Apache reservations as well as the Navajo reservation. So I watched this film today with a much more informed and jaundiced eye than when I was a kid. How bad IS this movie? Let me count the ways.1.Cinematography that wastes the natural beauty of Arizona, Utah and New Mexico while adding unbelievably cheap special effects including shadows that LENGTHEN in the morning(the defying the Laws of Physics part).2.A script that wastes the talents of the actors, especially the townspeople played by Wallach, Wynn, Cobb, Massey, Meredith, Quayle and Robinson whose on-screen appearances and deaths shortly after reminded me of the guest stars in the opening credit scenes of the old Police Squad TV series. Sharif horribly miscast as the Bandit chief, Colorado, whose secret ambition seems to be to become Louis Jourdan in Gigi. Peck as the stolid, stalwart hero at his MOST stolid. Camilla Sparv as the damsel in distress made of wood. Ted Cassidy and Julie Newmar as Tall Apaches which worked OK when I was a kid until I met REAL Apaches and realized how SHORT Apache people REALLY are. And Telly Savalas playing, well, Telly Savalas.3.Direction and production values that changed so much because they couldn't decide whether to shoot in cinerama, 70 mm or 35 mm, so they just decided to shoot some of the movie in each format and then edit it together with bubblegum, two band-aids and some spit.4. Quincy Jones' execrable score that should be played on loudspeakers in front of his house for a month as penance.5. The unbelievable ending sequences where the mere echoes of rifle fire and hoofbeats are loud enough to trigger a seismic event.If there's ANY saving grace to this movie, it's having Newmar play her character, Hesh-Ke as a mute. Considering the roles I've seen Newmar play where she SPEAKS, that was the single most effective direction in the entire movie. That and her nude scene, which was apparently her OWN idea so kudos to HER for that.So I give it three stars. One for the location shots, one for Newmar's Mute portrayal and one for her nude scene.
