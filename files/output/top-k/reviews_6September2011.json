For a so called classic it was almost unbearable to watch. Everything in this movie is so naive and badly played that I wanted to stab Elliot and his family in their throats 15 minutes in. I don't know why this move was so aggression-inducing for me but maybe it has something to do with A) me not being 12 B) me not being an American C) me not living in the 80's D) watching Wes Anderson's movies same weekStill... not the worst movie I have seen.Thumbs up for Audi 5000 S (that INLINE 5!) and Dee Wallace's nipples.
