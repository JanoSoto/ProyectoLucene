And the film is 2001 A Space Odyssey. The science fiction film of all science fiction films (well along with Metropolis and Bladerunner). An outstanding achievement in special effects, space travel, complex storytelling, scientific realism, surrealism and just filmmaking in general, 2001 boggles the mind with Mankind's most enduring and interesting philosophical questions.Who are we? Why are we here?And some interesting and probably more appealing questions to the public such as What else is out there? Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood who play astronauts seek to answer that question but Stanley Kubrick seeks to raise the other questions. Questions that we may never find out. But 2001 raises these questions with powerful images and outstanding special effects.A two and a half hour visual treat that really has withstood the test of time (well apart from some minor things), 2001 captures the mind with its eerie soundtrack, inspiring effects, powerful symbolism and story. A story that certainly takes its time but never bores. The most amazing thing is the story lies in the mind of the viewer. What does the viewer think of the meaning of life? Why we exist? Are there extraterrestrials out there in other galaxies? Kubrick wisely doesn't try to strictly answer those questions but certainly fills the mind with wonder at his ideas and theories on the screen. Some you may not agree with, others you might. But he never gives you a flat out answer.Starting years and years back to our ancestor apes and fast forwarding to 2001 where space travel is frequent and mankind has lost touch. Despite the awe and wonder of the Solar System, Dr Heywood Floyd is sound asleep on a flight to an orbiting space station and again on his flight to the Moon. Astronauts Dave Bowman (Dullea) and Frank Poole (Lockwood) are quiet and distant men. Frank Poole doesn't even spark up an emotion when watching his birthday celebration from his parents back home on Earth. Kubrick nailed it. We are losing touch with humanity. Like the characters in 2001, we constantly rely on technology. The astronauts consistently rely on HAL, a supercomputer, who keeps frequent watch over the space shuttle Discovery One. Technology isn't always reliable for obvious reasons. And you see that in 2001.Kubrick once famously stated that 2001's deepest psychological level is the search for God, and it finally postulates what is little less than a scientific definition of God. A statement that stuck with me ever since reading it, Kubrick also raises the ultimate religious question Is there a God? Controversial straight away, 2001 shows us that God could just be a metaphysical creation. God could be the cosmos itself. We look up at the night skies and see a vast and wonderful array of stars, planets, suns and galaxies. We could be staring at God everyday without knowing it. God watches over us from the heavens. A spiritual being, the creator of the Universe, the Man who has eternal existence, God could just be a nickname for Universe. The Universe is vast, limitless and timeless, ever expanding (from what we know so far), watches over us (philosophically) and has a great amount of power like mankind's view of God. I know that's a touching subject and I don't necessarily believe it as it is just a theory but Kubrick is telling us to think about life and these surrounding questions. It makes you think.A tense, sometimes creepy, enlightening and moving film, Kubrick's 2001 is his penultimate mystery tale (The Shining comes very close). It manages to haunt the mind with questions we may never find the answer to. But ultimately, it shows us a bright light at the end of a dark tunnel telling us we might still have hope.

In fact, to be fair, for most of the way it is quite an enjoyable film. John Wayne is strong in the lead, and I really liked Ben Johnson's presence here as his buddy side-kick. The love triangle is a bit silly, but amusing enough. The story is slight, but it is an extremely beautiful film, equaling The Searchers in its stunning Technicolor cinematography of Monument Valley. It moves at a good enough pace for the bulk of the running time, and it's a good film to sit back and enjoy the journey the film takes you on. Its story about coming of age between the characters, both passing on responsibility and accepting responsibility, is actually well done and the film is at times pleasantly sentimental.However, it is in the latter stages of the film where I really feel it faulters. Actually, to say it faulters is probably an understatement, as it almost absolutely tanks. First off, there is the horrendous, inexplicable bar brawl. Absolutely no excuse. I can forgive a similar road-block found in The Searchers because there the rest of the film is so strong that it makes up for it, and also the fight scene isn't as terrible as it is here. At this point of the film, there was actually quite an effective melancholy tone to the story, and the bar brawl involving McLaglen just brings the entire film to a screeching halt. It comes completely out of left field, and it is not funny at all -- it is embarrassingly stupid and goes on far too long, destroying tone and pace of the film. Because of this, the movie begins to drag.Secondly, the rest of the ending is questionable to me and makes little to no sense. Brittles last hurrah and redemption is one thing, although the way they miraculously defeat the Indian tribe seemed absurd, if not completely implausible. However, worse is the seemingly tacked on happy ending of Wayne's character literally shown riding out into the sunset, and then literally a moment later with the narrator claiming, But the army wasn't done with him yet, and then showing him riding back in. WHAT??? Good lord, it just feels so cheap. The hokey narration doesn't help any either, and Ford's usual populist sentiments seem to drift into jingoistic ones, which is never a good thing for me.Ford did much better in Fort Apache -- a far more polished and satisfying cavalry film as a whole.

I mean, they were all okay, but none were superb.The problem both with the writing and portrayal of the title character, Karl Childers, is that we did not get a real feel for what motivated the character. We are given his history but no sense of the conflicts which must have driven him, his choices, his decisions, and his actions.Maybe it was Thornton being subtle. However, after thinking about the movie for hours after watching it, I have come to some conclusions about the character. First, and most importantly, Childers was not intellectually retarded. In fact, he was quite intelligent. He showed a self-taught knowledge of engines and was able to plan and carry out actions with a Swiss precision and a German efficiency. Instead, Thornton was socially stunted due to the extremely poor socialization he underwent as a child. It was not that Thornton could not learn --he learned well-- the problem was that he was taught all the wrong things.Still, even as a child, Thornton had an innate concept of right and wrong which propelled his actions. This was exhibited in the handling of his brother and the killing of his mother. Though more mature some 20 years later, this innate sense of right and wrong would continue to rule his life.The other thing that was not explored in the movie was the motivations for the actions of the main character's parents. To be sure, they were odd ducks, but no so odd as to be totally different from humanity. The key in understanding how the child was treated is in understanding the relationship of the parents. It was made clear that Karl's mother was caught cheating on his father.

She tries out a few men not realizing the relationship her son has started with the babysitter (John Travolta). The entire idea of this movie seems like a major mess so it really comes as a great shock to see how loving, caring and downright adorable the picture is. The idea of a single mom trying to find a father for a baby who we constantly get voice-overs from isn't the greatest story out there but the performances are so good, the laughs so big and the heart is in the right place and all of this really adds up to a rather special movie. A lot of the credit for the laughs has to go to Bruce Willis who does a very good job with the voice-overs. His comic timing is dead-on from start to finish but I think the most important thing was how child-like in nature he was. We've had dozens of movies that used voice-overs to try and get laughs but they usually fail because they either try too hard or the comedy is forced but that's never the case here because the work is done with such ease by Willis that you can't help but feel as if you're actually listening to how a real kid would think and talk. Alley is also very good in her part, although I'd probably argue that the screenplay could have toned down on some of her hard-edge because at times you start to question some of her character traits. Olympia Dukakis, George Segal and Abe Vigoda are all good in their small parts but I think the key to the film's success is the performance of Travolta. This was the GREASE stars first major role in years and it would also serve as his first comeback but of course the sequels would lead to his eventual fall before Tarantino rescued him once again. Either way, the performance here is so great that you really can't help but fall in love with his character. Travolta does a remarkable job at just being so adorable, so caring and so protective of the child that you want to see them together. Being a Travolta movie you can expect a dance sequence and how they pull it off here is incredibly fun and touching. Every single second of the movie is predictable from a scene where Travolta gives some tips to a guy looking to take Alley out to the ending but that really doesn't matter. Heart is a hard thing to get into any film let alone a comedy but this film really hits it out of the part. Mix in the terrific soundtrack and you've got a perfect little gem.

It's just too easy to extract the symbolism from this film as it relates to the passing of it's principal stars so soon after it's release. I doubt if the actors were ever thinking in terms of the 'big picture' while making this underrated gem, but in hindsight the movie closes out the careers of some major Hollywood stars on a wistful note, made all the more poignant by the trajectory of their careers and the way they died.All the while I kept getting distracted by the young Eli Wallach's uncanny resemblance to Joe Pesci, and while trying to shake that, I managed conjuring up a mental picture of George Clooney twenty years from now and came up with Clark Gable's Gay Langland. Of course, there's only one Marilyn Monroe, and if you weren't thinking it, Gable's character manages to chime in to remind us that 'She's real prime.There have been many films about the passing of the Old West, but none that have come so close to the modern era to state it's message.

Right here is his reply, anywhere and nowhere, and oddly, one is as good as the other.I wonder if Gable felt out of place among these young actors. Monty, Monroe and Wallach all came up in the 'method' tradition, and when Gable tries that approach, it has almost a humorous outcome. I'm referring to the scene when he literally cracks when he finds that his kids have abandoned him at the hotel, climbing up on a car and falling off for dramatic effect, yelling at the top of his lungs. 'Were they even there?' was my thought. Was he so overwrought wishing they had showed up that he made himself believe it? I don't know enough about Arthur Miller's script to know the answer and have only now seen the film for the first time, but it's an interesting exercise to think through.For the male leads, there's no doubt that they all turned in exceptional performances here.

David Lynch has crafted a truly magnificent film set in Hollywood, The City of Angels. A place where stars are made... but some fade. Some become destined for eternal success years after they pass on, but some disappear with the click of a finger with nothing but darkness. Think Elizabeth Short aka The Black Dahlia or Peg Entwistle. That's the haunting thing about Hollywood. It's the most alluring city in the world for its deep roots in the entertainment industry but its bright lights and famous stars also lies in darkness. Deep down, Hollywood, Los Angeles is devilish, disturbing... bleak.Billy Wilder showed us the ugly side of Hollywood in his 1950 film noir classic Sunset Boulevard and 51 years later David Lynch continues this tradition with his neo noir psychological thriller Mulholland Drive. Obviously that is a small portion of analysis and there is deeper symbolism but the dark side of Hollywood stuck with me the most.Shot against the dark backdrop of Los Angeles, we follow many different characters Betty Elms (played by Naomi Watts), an aspiring actress from Canada in search for the Hollywood dream, a mysterious femme fatale who calls herself Rita (Laura Harring) in search of her identity and befriends Betty and Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux), a confident yet arrogant film director striving to maintain complete artistic control over his latest movie... but the last part of the film rips through conventional film noir storytelling and gives us a whole new batch of characters. Here we have Diane Selwyn (Naomi Watts), an unsuccessful and psychologically troubled actress Camilla Rhodes (Laura Harring), a successful and talented actress who just finished working with director Adam Kesher. Skipping between the past and present, we are shown a non- linear view of Diane's emotional and psychological breakdown. It may be sad, scary and tough to watch but Lynch just keeps our eyes stuck to the screen because of Naomi Watts brilliance. A film noir, psychological thriller, dark comedy, horror, drama, romance; MD is a wide mix of genres. You can't really place it in one genre. Or time frame. In fact, time is stuck in this film, we never really know when this film takes place. Lynch gives us a timeless feel due to his references to previous decades and films. One minute we see the iconic poster of Gilda (1940's film) then we see the more contemporary looking director Adam Kesher driving a fancy Porsche car. Rita is a classic femme fatale (a common female character in 40's\/50's film noir). So mesmerising.Despite the amazing performances from Watts, Harring and Theroux, the incredible cinematography and the hauntingly beautiful score from Angelo Badalamenti; the star of the show is David Lynch The heart and soul of Mulholland Drive. His driving force and determination to create one of the greatest films ever made is outstanding. Only a few have perfectly recreated a disturbing Los Angeles on film, crafted an intricate and complex story, pushed Naomi Watts to the limit to show us just how talented she is or gave us a visually stunning treat full of unpredictable moments.A very rare treat, Lynch has given us a film that will scare you, shock you, move you and most importantly inspire you. From his dream logic, surrealism, to the dark look at Hollywood, to his psychological, philosophical and metaphysical ideas and probably most importantly to film buffs, his unique directing style, Lynch is an inspiration and a sensation. Following Kubrick's road with rich symbolism, fantastic lighting and cinematography, very memorable characters, Mulholland Drive will change the way you look at films. Forever.

David Lynch has crafted a truly magnificent film set in Hollywood, The City of Angels. A place where stars are made... but some fade. Some become destined for eternal success years after they pass on, but some disappear with the click of a finger with nothing but darkness. Think Elizabeth Short aka The Black Dahlia or Peg Entwistle. That's the haunting thing about Hollywood. It's the most alluring city in the world for its deep roots in the entertainment industry but its bright lights and famous stars also lies in darkness. Deep down, Hollywood, Los Angeles is devilish, disturbing... bleak.Billy Wilder showed us the ugly side of Hollywood in his 1950 film noir classic Sunset Boulevard and 51 years later David Lynch continues this tradition with his neo noir psychological thriller Mulholland Drive. Obviously that is a small portion of analysis and there is deeper symbolism but the dark side of Hollywood stuck with me the most.Shot against the dark backdrop of Los Angeles, we follow many different characters Betty Elms (played by Naomi Watts), an aspiring actress from Canada in search for the Hollywood dream, a mysterious femme fatale who calls herself Rita (Laura Harring) in search of her identity and befriends Betty and Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux), a confident yet arrogant film director striving to maintain complete artistic control over his latest movie... but the last part of the film rips through conventional film noir storytelling and gives us a whole new batch of characters. Here we have Diane Selwyn (Naomi Watts), an unsuccessful and psychologically troubled actress Camilla Rhodes (Laura Harring), a successful and talented actress who just finished working with director Adam Kesher. Skipping between the past and present, we are shown a non- linear view of Diane's emotional and psychological breakdown. It may be sad, scary and tough to watch but Lynch just keeps our eyes stuck to the screen because of Naomi Watts brilliance. A film noir, psychological thriller, dark comedy, horror, drama, romance; MD is a wide mix of genres. You can't really place it in one genre. Or time frame. In fact, time is stuck in this film, we never really know when this film takes place. Lynch gives us a timeless feel due to his references to previous decades and films. One minute we see the iconic poster of Gilda (1940's film) then we see the more contemporary looking director Adam Kesher driving a fancy Porsche car. Rita is a classic femme fatale (a common female character in 40's\/50's film noir). So mesmerising.Despite the amazing performances from Watts, Harring and Theroux, the incredible cinematography and the hauntingly beautiful score from Angelo Badalamenti; the star of the show is David Lynch The heart and soul of Mulholland Drive.

Therefore the picture today does not equal the quality of the original which was released back then, but it definitely isn't a problem. It was only in 2008, that they found another copy of the original in Argentina with a lot of the original missing footage, which was used to restore the movie as superbly as possible. Of course not everything has been recovered, and it is highly unlikely that it will change in the near future. But having this fact in mind, it is amazing how well the movie looks. The plot is unquestionably perfect. A legendary masterpiece. It is about humanity. It's flaws, it's sins, and it's virtues. The main character, who has been living a comfortable life, discovers the 'real' world. Cruelty and harsh settings for people rule life for the majority of the city's population. 'The workers'. After witnessing the unfairness of it all, he is determined to make a change. Also, as the Metropolis is practically one huge machine, that sucks the living effort out of hard workers, there is an important element of humanity versus machinery, which is heavily essential to film's idea. More clearly speaking, the plot actually resembles ''the Matrix'' and ''Dark City''. It would be quite likely if the creators of ''the Matrix''and ''Dark City'' were inspired by ''Metropolis''. At least that's just my opinion. But of course comparing the two for anything else that the idea of the story, I believe, would be unwise, as they differ one from the other aggressively. Probably due to the fact that the the time line between the both premiers is massively huge. Exactly 72 years! So if you liked ''the Matrix'' or ''Dark City'', I can not guarantee you will enjoy ''Metropolis'' as well. However, the fact still remains that the plot's are based alike. Knowing that this WAS one of the first major sci-fi stories, it would be idiotic to neglect it's importance. It IS a must see to any film fanatic, and ESPECIALLY to a sci-fi fan. A sci-fi fan not having seen ''Metropolis'' is the same as an artist not knowing who Leonardo da Vinci was.

The thing is, this character completely lacks charisma. He sounds like a rip-off of Eddie Murphy's Buckwheat character from SNL, but not even close to as amusing.

There can only be one original, and that was it.As is always the case, the imitations gave us more of what audiences found appealing in the original. Not only more, but much more. Often, too much more.In Raiders, the archaeologist hero had to beat the Nazis in finding the Lost Ark of the Covenant. Here, the hero, Frazier, has to beat a bunch of greedy Americans looking for treasure. Frazier is funded by Weisz's library. Unlike Indiana Jones, he has no particular profession. No identity, really, beyond that of the figure who must save the delicious Rachel Weisz when she is strapped down on an altar of rock next to a disgusting mummy who is brought to life.Raiders didn't have CGIs but The Mummy certainly does. The mummies march around in cadence, holding shields and swords, a rip off of Ray Harryhausen's skeleton fight from Jason and the Argonauts. But if you like action, you'll get it here. And some of it revolting enough to be thoroughly enjoyable. Nothing I like better than seeing a man eaten alive by overgrown cockroaches. Frazier jumps around, a pistol in each hand, wearing a 1920s outfit with crossed holsters and boots. (Raiders was set in the 30s.)

You'll be thrilled by John Huston's masterpiece, a genuine monument that would catch by surprise, even the most skeptical viewers when it comes to 'old' movies.The Sierra Madre was the first major studios films set outside Hollywood, in Mexico, when even the most acclaimed masterpieces didn't raise such a level of authenticity in their exotic setting, like in Casablanca when Captain Renault refers to the titular town as the middle of the desert. The geography in Huston's film is crucial as it provides the obligatory escapism for any adventure film, with a unique flavor. In Sierra Madre we get the same authentic feeling that probably inspired Clouzot's Wages of Fear, with the proverbial financial struggle of the white men in South America. There's almost the same criticism of capitalism that prevailed in B. Travel's novel, as these men have been purely and totally exploited by the capitalistic majors that literally raped Mexico from its precious resources.Huston's movie is less politically loaded, but it portrayed capitalism in a negative light through the downfall and total disintegration of its main character, Humphrey Bogart as Fred C. Dobbs. Bogie, after having been a gangster, a private eye, a cynical, detached, and sometimes romantic lead, probably gives one of his best performances as a big s.o.b. And how he didn't get a nomination is unbelievable. His evolution from a decent man who wants a job and some money to the cold-blooded paranoid lunatic who tries to keep the gold for himself is not only fascinating but also mirrors the evolution of the film from a light-hearted mood, made of some comedic running gags like the encounters with Huston as the rich man in a white suit, to a heart-pounding thriller.And on that very level, the differences between the characters set the perfect circumstances for tension, despite the many signs of camaraderie displayed in the beginning. Curtin, Tim Holt in a remarkable performance, is younger and exudes a certain idealistic naiveté that counterbalances Dobbs' growing cynicism. Howard, the old-time prospector, an unforgettable Walter Huston, knows everything about prospecting, with enough experience to foresee the psychological changes on people when gold is at stakes. Of course, the movie is also remembered for the famous 'Gold Hat', Alfonso Bedoya with his unforgettable stinking badges line but more than an exotic villain, Bedoya foreshadows with a sort of charming charisma the evolution of Dobbs as a similar bastard.Indeed, one never knows how gold would transform us, and one must have the guts to work alone without falling into madness. During their journey guided by Howard, Dobbs and Curtin discover the true meaning of the word 'value' as measurable through the efforts you spend, days and nights, to find the treasure. Walter Huston deservedly won the Oscar for best supporting character, but he's as central as Vito Corleone in The Godfather. Whatever Howard says, we know it's the truth, when he's reluctant, we understand it's a bad premonition. And when Howard esteems that the best would be to split the share when it becomes money, Dobbs, already showing signs of suspicion, recommends that each one takes care of his own share. Howard is experimented enough to resign, with all the wisdom of a man who doesn't want trouble.Dobbs' gradual descent into paranoid madness is highlighted in the episode when a gila monster gets stuck under the rock that covered his share while he suspects Curtin to have come for another reason. The paranoia grows and contaminates the whole team when another American named Cody, joins them and proposes his help. He's obviously smarter than them and doesn't deny that murdering him is an option they would consider. The way the team handled his proposal says a lot about the conservative instinct that could govern so called 'civilized' hearts, and again, doesn't speak in favor of the monopolistic systems regulated by capitalism. The alienation that grows within the team erodes all the camaraderie built during these months of labor, to a point even the word 'partner' loses its humanistic meaning.Bogart perfectly embodied the metamorphosis of a man alienated by his own greed, where the value of his share of gold, exceeded, every kind of principle that made him a decent man. As it's almost impossible to break free from a gila's bite, Dobbs became that gila with paranoia as a venomous poison, too mistrustful to go, to let go or to be reasoned. When Curtin says he protected Howard's money as he would have done for Dobbs, Dobbs uses the same reasoning in a reverse way, pushing cynicism to its paroxysm  betraying before being betrayed. And in an ironic anticlimactic twist, Dobbs is killed by bandits, 15 minutes before the end of the film as to highlight the pointlessness of this entire struggle. After all, what's the point of earning money if you lose principles? Failure is a recurrent theme in Huston's films with this double dimension of cynical denunciation, generally driven by an impeccable script, and this entertaining dimension that pleases the crowds as much as the more sophisticated audience, both who, matured enough by World War II, accepted a story about greed and deception, but maybe not Bogie so far from his usual character, playing such an unsavory bastard. I don't know, if like some said, this is why the film's flopped. One thing for sure, after 60 years, it remains as one of the most enduring classics ever, that beautifully earned a father and a son three deserved Oscars.And any other consideration is as pointless as crying over the loss of the Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and the only reaction it deserves is the unique loud and hysterical, jig-driven, maniacal laugh of Walter Huston &#x85; ","genre":null},{"date":"17 July 2011","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" A brutal and uncompromising portrayal of greed's effects on the human spirit and an exhilarating quest of the Mexican El Dorado, the Treasure of the Sierra Madre.

You'll be thrilled by John Huston's masterpiece, a genuine monument that would catch by surprise, even the most skeptical viewers when it comes to 'old' movies.The Sierra Madre was the first major studios films set outside Hollywood, in Mexico, when even the most acclaimed masterpieces didn't raise such a level of authenticity in their exotic setting, like in Casablanca when Captain Renault refers to the titular town as the middle of the desert. The geography in Huston's film is crucial as it provides the obligatory escapism for any adventure film, with a unique flavor. In Sierra Madre we get the same authentic feeling that probably inspired Clouzot's Wages of Fear, with the proverbial financial struggle of the white men in South America. There's almost the same criticism of capitalism that prevailed in B. Travel's novel, as these men have been purely and totally exploited by the capitalistic majors that literally raped Mexico from its precious resources.Huston's movie is less politically loaded, but it portrayed capitalism in a negative light through the downfall and total disintegration of its main character, Humphrey Bogart as Fred C. Dobbs. Bogie, after having been a gangster, a private eye, a cynical, detached, and sometimes romantic lead, probably gives one of his best performances as a big s.o.b. And how he didn't get a nomination is unbelievable. His evolution from a decent man who wants a job and some money to the cold-blooded paranoid lunatic who tries to keep the gold for himself is not only fascinating but also mirrors the evolution of the film from a light-hearted mood, made of some comedic running gags like the encounters with Huston as the rich man in a white suit, to a heart-pounding thriller.And on that very level, the differences between the characters set the perfect circumstances for tension, despite the many signs of camaraderie displayed in the beginning. Curtin, Tim Holt in a remarkable performance, is younger and exudes a certain idealistic naiveté that counterbalances Dobbs' growing cynicism. Howard, the old-time prospector, an unforgettable Walter Huston, knows everything about prospecting, with enough experience to foresee the psychological changes on people when gold is at stakes. Of course, the movie is also remembered for the famous 'Gold Hat', Alfonso Bedoya with his unforgettable stinking badges line but more than an exotic villain, Bedoya foreshadows with a sort of charming charisma the evolution of Dobbs as a similar bastard.Indeed, one never knows how gold would transform us, and one must have the guts to work alone without falling into madness. During their journey guided by Howard, Dobbs and Curtin discover the true meaning of the word 'value' as measurable through the efforts you spend, days and nights, to find the treasure. Walter Huston deservedly won the Oscar for best supporting character, but he's as central as Vito Corleone in The Godfather. Whatever Howard says, we know it's the truth, when he's reluctant, we understand it's a bad premonition. And when Howard esteems that the best would be to split the share when it becomes money, Dobbs, already showing signs of suspicion, recommends that each one takes care of his own share. Howard is experimented enough to resign, with all the wisdom of a man who doesn't want trouble.Dobbs' gradual descent into paranoid madness is highlighted in the episode when a gila monster gets stuck under the rock that covered his share while he suspects Curtin to have come for another reason. The paranoia grows and contaminates the whole team when another American named Cody, joins them and proposes his help. He's obviously smarter than them and doesn't deny that murdering him is an option they would consider.
