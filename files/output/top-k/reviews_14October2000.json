I can't say that about many movies I see these days. The creative lighting and exciting photography struck me first.  Hey, this is beautiful!  The script (by John Pogue) is so well written that the story simply unfolds interestingly and believably.  Later analysis may tell you it's not flawless.  But the real test of a good script is that during the movie the viewer stays attached to the story, and no single film-making aspect -- good or bad -- pulls you out of it for long.  Every surprise, every twist of the plot here, made sense because they had been neatly set up in advance.  No clumsy, distracting explanations were needed. The title may suggest gore or horror, but the movie doesn't fit either category.  The Skulls is a secret society at certain Ivy League colleges, with members (alumni) worldwide.  Their goal is political leadership, and they're clearly evil and pretty powerful. Where does the story take place?  The letter Y appears often.  Once it covers a whole wall.  Even Yale's Gothic architecture is suggested.  I was sure it wasn't shot at Yale; the story's concept is a bit too lurid and no college is ever named as the setting.

The climax, I have to admit, *almost* strains credulity.  A group of men in formal tails stages a duel -- with antique pistols, no less -- in broad daylight at a monument that must surely be a focal point of the campus. But it's unfair to describe this sequence so coldly, out of context.  By this time in the film, the suspense is so great and the overall excellence so high, that it works.  I believed it.  This was the only right way for the film-makers to do it. The Skulls should be a textbook movie for any writer who needs to learn how to deal with the incredible and make us believe it.  It follows two basic principles (1) It achieves high standards of quality in all fields; and (2) It knows precisely what a discerning audience will accept.

His agent and so-called girl friend can do nothing but living in the past, in fact both of them reject ¡§change¡¨, although slightly different is the attitude they take. The agent's longing for communication is shown from her voice-over in the ending, but too scared is she of being hurt, and therefore isolation seems inevitable.  Her relation with the killer also reveals this point clearly. Almost everyone undergoes a complete transformation in this movie, but no one other than the dumb-boy can solve the problem radically.

He is pacing around the small room, and he is admiring paintings of former presidents, Woodrow Wilson, George Washington, and John F. Kennedy, even going so far as to mimic Kennedy's pose from the fabulous Norman Rockwell painting. It speaks of the uplifting and admirable traits of public service, and what good, honest men strive to believe as the reason they give their life in service to their country. But, you also realize that in order for Webster to succeed in the world of politics, and to do good for the country, he will have to transform into the types of politicians that President Evans, played by Jeff Bridges, and Sen. Runyon , played by Gary Oldman, are. That is, the key to the succeeding nature of someone in politics is not their conviction, their believes, or even their morals, but instead their ability to manipulate other people's convictions, believes and morals in order to gain the support needed to get something done for the American people.As much as this movie speaks of the privacy of candidates and the unscrupulous nature of both right-wing politics, which itself is a bias term (you never hear of the left-wing conspiracy, do you) and of the press, it tells us more about the flaws of candidates and of politicians in American culture. They don't necessarily have to do what is right, but what the American people will perceive as being right.The movie starts with a car crashing down from a bridge. An honorable governor, Jack Hathaway, jumps in to the water to save the people inside, but he does not succeed. We later find that he is on top of the list of vice presidential candidates, to fill the vacancy left by the death of the current one. He meets with the president and his advisors, and they tell him that he will not be recommended to succeed the vice presidency because of the spin that he let the girl die, as opposed to attempting to save it. `A girl died, and you let it happen,' they tell him, and we find that perception isn't everything, it's the only thing.The president chooses Sen. Hanson, who we first see in the film making love to her husband (on his desk). Joan Allen brings a toughness and determination to the role, and she proves that she is one of the great female actresses around today. She allows us to see through her character the moral stand that she takes, and the reasons why she takes it.Then you have Gary Oldman, who plays the old right-wing republican who heads the committee in charge of confirming her. I have always referred to Gary Oldman as my favorite actor, because he hides in his roles, and no matter how badly written, brings out the utmost in the characters he plays. Many times, people don't know who he is when I mention his name, and not because they haven't seen the films he is in, but that they didn't recognize him. Here, he is aided by a terrific script, penned by the director Rod Lurie, and he gives a great performance, Oscar-worthy, and allows us not to see him as a bad guy, but rather an opinionated one who is misguided in how he makes his choice for vice president. He disagrees with her on issues, most heatedly abortion, but when it comes down to it, he disapproves of her confirmation based on her gender, and the sex scandal is just a tool he can uses in order to allow his means to meet the desired end.The one scene I didn't like, and that didn't fit the movie, what near the end, when we find that Hanson wasn't the girl in the photographs, and that she was innocent the entire time. Instead of stating this, and avoiding all of the damaging allegations and investigations that ensued, she chose to stick by her view that the question, whether she was guilty of it or not, wasn't right to ask in the first place. I happen to agree with this, but I think that by stating so plainly that she was innocent, and then even going so far as to show that the heroic governor from the first half of the movie as a criminal, it takes away form that message. The important thing is that the question is wrong, and if you believe that, you shouldn't care if it is true or false.A lot has been made about the Hollywood typecasting of politics. It is almost always the good, heart-filled democrats trying to save the country from the mindless, mean-spirited Republicans who wish nothing more to destroy it with guns ablaze. I'm a registered republican, and I felt that this movie, although biased, is true to the nature of Washington, which itself is biased. Lets face it, voting party lines means nothing more then siding with your team, even if you may not believe in what the team is fighting for. I prefer movies like this, where the director has an obvious point of view, and uses it in a way that progresses the story, as opposed to some success and admiration driven director\/writer, who is just looking for a box-office hit and is trying to make his movie all things to all people.

","genre":"Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"14 October 2000","score":"","review":"  SPOILER ALERT- I reveal a couple of plot points in this review, so just be aware*** 1\/2 out of fourThere is a great scene that occurs in The Contender where Representative Reginald Webster (Christian Slater), a naïve democrat from Delaware, is waiting to meet the president to discuss the confirmation of Senator Laine Hanson to vice president, played with an oscar-calibur performance by Joan Allen. He is pacing around the small room, and he is admiring paintings of former presidents, Woodrow Wilson, George Washington, and John F. Kennedy, even going so far as to mimic Kennedy's pose from the fabulous Norman Rockwell painting. It speaks of the uplifting and admirable traits of public service, and what good, honest men strive to believe as the reason they give their life in service to their country. But, you also realize that in order for Webster to succeed in the world of politics, and to do good for the country, he will have to transform into the types of politicians that President Evans, played by Jeff Bridges, and Sen. Runyon , played by Gary Oldman, are. That is, the key to the succeeding nature of someone in politics is not their conviction, their believes, or even their morals, but instead their ability to manipulate other people's convictions, believes and morals in order to gain the support needed to get something done for the American people.As much as this movie speaks of the privacy of candidates and the unscrupulous nature of both right-wing politics, which itself is a bias term (you never hear of the left-wing conspiracy, do you) and of the press, it tells us more about the flaws of candidates and of politicians in American culture. They don't necessarily have to do what is right, but what the American people will perceive as being right.The movie starts with a car crashing down from a bridge. An honorable governor, Jack Hathaway, jumps in to the water to save the people inside, but he does not succeed. We later find that he is on top of the list of vice presidential candidates, to fill the vacancy left by the death of the current one. He meets with the president and his advisors, and they tell him that he will not be recommended to succeed the vice presidency because of the spin that he let the girl die, as opposed to attempting to save it. `A girl died, and you let it happen,' they tell him, and we find that perception isn't everything, it's the only thing.The president chooses Sen. Hanson, who we first see in the film making love to her husband (on his desk). Joan Allen brings a toughness and determination to the role, and she proves that she is one of the great female actresses around today. She allows us to see through her character the moral stand that she takes, and the reasons why she takes it.Then you have Gary Oldman, who plays the old right-wing republican who heads the committee in charge of confirming her. I have always referred to Gary Oldman as my favorite actor, because he hides in his roles, and no matter how badly written, brings out the utmost in the characters he plays. Many times, people don't know who he is when I mention his name, and not because they haven't seen the films he is in, but that they didn't recognize him. Here, he is aided by a terrific script, penned by the director Rod Lurie, and he gives a great performance, Oscar-worthy, and allows us not to see him as a bad guy, but rather an opinionated one who is misguided in how he makes his choice for vice president. He disagrees with her on issues, most heatedly abortion, but when it comes down to it, he disapproves of her confirmation based on her gender, and the sex scandal is just a tool he can uses in order to allow his means to meet the desired end.The one scene I didn't like, and that didn't fit the movie, what near the end, when we find that Hanson wasn't the girl in the photographs, and that she was innocent the entire time.

One is the beggining of the putrid Thorn storyline...well actually it was OK in this film...It didn't get really bad until the next chapter.Firstly, I'd like to say that this is a step up from part IV. The acting was 80% better. The characters ranged from okay to likeable. And this is the only character development we've seen from Loomis or Michael throughout the entire series. This movie actually set up to do something different, using more a more psychological rather than the same tired old formula.It takes place a year after Halloween 4, with Michael Myers apparently dead...Jamie Llyod under the care of a children's clinic...and all those affected by the previous rampages trying to get on with their lives. Hoewever, Halloween time is nearing and Loomis knows that Michael is still out there. How does he know? He's a recurring character...obviously he'd know!This time Michael is becoming more and more agressively and Jamie has some sort of bond with her uncle. Now she can see what he sees. Michael uses this to sadistically torture his nine year old niece by killing off all her friends one by one and she can feel it every time it happens.Another interesting storyline is Loomis trying to reach Michael's human side. Very, very good for a sequel.But the bad stuff brings it down. Too much of the movie was used as a set up for the next sequel and it couldn't possibly stand on it's own very well. The Myers mask could've been better..Overall, a very good slasher flick, just below the first two. If they had ditched the entire thorn thing and given us a more satisfying ending like Michael simply being locked away in prison for the rest of his life then this movie could've been better than the first two.I also didn't mention the excellent directing, loads of suspense, and a very agressive interpretation of Michael Myers...that makes it a good movie too. Just don't except something too much in the vein of the first film because this one is different.I prayed that he would burn in hell...but in my heart, I knew that hell would not have him!-Donald Pleasence ","genre":null},{"date":"14 October 2000","score":"","review":"  This movie gets a lot of crap for many reasons.

You're trying to tell me he doesn't talk to one person in the entire movie besides Cole, and he never realizes anything is going on??  I just want to know how he get's into places if no one lets him in.  Does he let himself in and sit with the mother, thinking she seems him the whole time?  No way.  The story had too many holes in it this way...you cannot end the movie and say to yourself, 'oh yea, that could happen.'  I don't know which was made first, but Stir Of Echoes was released first, and this movie seems to be a rip off of it.  If this one was written first, then I guess Stir of Echoes is a better version of the same type of movie.  The acting is good, tho Bruce Willis isn't what you would call the best actor ever, the kid in the movie--who everyone rant and raves about is a good actor, but his character--oh man, you just want to kick him in the head he's so annoying.   I'd give the movie 5\/10, it's somewhat enjoyable, but the plot holes are too constant to make you actually believe any of it.

It asks some very serious questions about the nature of military orders and nuclear warfare and shows both the leads at their best.  It contains some very deep levels of its message about conflicts between officers and how that affects the chain of command. This movie, more than anything, is driven by its two leads.  Both Hackman and Washington are gold and the characters they play were excellently written and developed.  Both are extremely nuanced and balanced (in terms of character) and one can easily understand either one.  Hackman's Capt. Ramsey is the quintessential implement of policy, a 25-year veteran fanatically committed to his mission while Washington's Lt. Cmdr. Hunter is a new Navy product of Annapolis and Harvard, who sees war itself as the enemy in the nuclear era and displays a careful deliberation and consideration of how to proceed in the crisis.  One could see Hackman as the gallant front-line defender who exists to protect his nation, while at the same time being dangerously overzealous, rash and callous in consideration of the power at his all-too-human hands.  At the same time, Washington's polished officer, while being wise, cautious can also be seen as perhaps still being too fresh, inexperienced and indecisive at times.  It's a dilemma and a wonderfully done character-sketching in grey, that leaves one with the point, as the movie ultimately concludes, that both men are right, and also wrong, at the same time. I've heard a lot of commentary on this movie a couple of different ways. For one, regarding whether or not something like this is possible.  That's a valid point, thankfully.  Nuclear submarine crews are famous for their mature, polite and intellectual natures.  They spend months underwater in relatively cramped, sealed steel tubes, work potentially long shifts at highly technical jobs, face a tremendous amount of responsibility and have to maintain extraordinary composure and discipline in a potential combat situation when they probably have a very limited picture of what's around them and no real chance to escape if something bad happens.  The Navy tends to select and screen people for that silent, and arduous, service very carefully, and it is tough to imagine that there would be mutinies with crewmen pointing guns at each other on a US nuclear sub.  It's important for a military command structure to function smoothly, with everyone doing their best to work together within the system, which the movie points out. Militaries have been in business for thousands of years, they've continually figured out how to function and what kind of people they want.  The likeliest scenario, probably, if the situation ever got as bad as an XO being forced to relieve his CO, would be for them to confer privately, after everyone's cooled off a little, and try to come to a workable solution to preserve the chain-of-command and carry out their orders.  That's probably better than a mutiny with 24 nuclear missiles up for grabs anyway. (If you haven't seen the movie, you may not want to keep reading)  The other issue I've heard about is the ending, that the system decides that both Hunter and Ramsey are right, and wrong, and Ramsey simply retires while Hunter goes on to his next assignment.  That is actually believable.  The scene at the end, with the board of inquiry, is actually very nuanced and could mean a couple of things.  For one, such boards are going to have respect for a 25-year veteran and show him professional courtesy.  They also will work to head-off a potential publicity nightmare that drops into their lap.  The Jason Robards two-star who heads up the board says in recognition of his long and dedicated service, Captain Ramsey's request for early retirement is granted.  At senior levels of government service, including the military, no one is ever publicly given the boot, unless either they force it on themselves or they commit a crime or a serious breach of trust. Instead, their resignation is accepted.  The point is to avoid ugly publicity and to show someone the respect of allowing them to walk away with their reputation and honor intact.  Ramsey very well might have thought it best to resign himself.  Given the circumstances, whatever the findings, he was never going to be given another command, and so would have taken the best opportunity to end his career with his head high and his pension and prospects for a teaching, consulting or writing position secure.  When he leaves, he never really admits that he was in the wrong, with that little joke about the horses to Hunter, which probably sits well with the psychology of someone in that situation.  His whole world is turned upside down as it is, so he copes with it by taking the best route out and leaves still proud and this is accepted and expected, even by Hunter.  They maintain a mutual respect.  Notably, the board states that Hunter's being sent on to his next assignment with all due speed is in part due to Ramsey's recommendation. The ultimate resolution was one that was in everyone's best interests, given the circumstances, and that is why it came out the way it did.  It made the job of the board easier as well, as they could deftly evade a potential landmine by saying that everyone acted in the best tradition of the Navy and the best interests of the United States, pensioning off the old-timer and giving the younger guy his next job, with the implicit knowledge that he ought keep up the official line for the sake of his career.  An interesting dichotomy, at first a total breakdown in the system and then the system working to resolve it as best as possible.  Of course, this time, without a nuclear war looming on the horizon.  Probably Hunter's career would survive, though he would ALWAYS have an eye looking down on him from above and would have to know that no one ever survives something like that twice, that if he ever went outside the chain of command again, no one would believe it an accident.  It is possible, in the future, that he would never promote past a certain level, or that a superior could hold a bias or attempt to hold the affair over his head.  These, of course, are all assumptions and possibilities that are left to the viewer to decide. As in the submarine itself, we are presented only with what the players see, another mark of genius to this film.

It's not a matter of my disagreeing with the film's politics, but the didactic nature of the script and the fatal unbelievability of the characters.Case in point the judicial confirmation sequence, which features Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman) criticizing Laine Hansen (Joan Allen) over her pro-choice stance, with invective, emotionalism and, strangely, cliches that would barely find their place on a pro-life pamphlet. I can't see a Senate confirmation hearing devolving into that kind of sensationalism -- forgive me if I'm wrong, but I can't believe that would ring true.I also found Jeff Bridges' Presidential character cynically portrayed to the point of annoyance. Maybe it would be wonderful to have a President so jaded about the sanctity of his position that he frankly considers the benefits of free food and catered whims the best part of the job. He's a buffoon who eventually attains a profile of dignity, but I don't believe the ascension is real. It all feels done for show. Other elements of the writing and characterization are broad as the Beltway; it's a careening script that reflects literary intelligence and fanciful characters at the same time that it betrays a political naivete.It's compellingly frustrating, because this is the best ensemble acting I've seen since Pulp Fiction. Despite the massive reservations I had with his character, Bridges is extremely fun to watch, as is Oldman. I loved Joan Allen's restraint and dignity.Lurie made an interesting film, Deterrence, which took an unbelievable premise and slowly infused it with an authenticity. Here he achieves the opposite, simply because he was too unwilling to risk his message being lost. If there were more subtlety in the film, if the sinister ambitions of the characters were more implied, it might have worked better. If the audience weren't blunted over the head with The Author's Message, that message might have been more powerful. This was the exact same problem with Philadelphia -- overwriting. Any film that comes right out and says its message directly, didactically, turns me off, whether or not I agree with the sentiment being expressed. The audience should be led to the trough, but not doused with the water.A big, though by no means bereft, disappointment.

About five minutes into 'Lost Souls' (which I had no prior knowledge of), I was wishing I had gone for 'Coyote Ugly.'  'Lost Souls' is just another movie making the Catholic Church look like a freaky-deeky, fanatical, mumbling, dark, terrifying religion, and I can't say I'm surprised.  It follows an exact prototype of 'Stigmata' and 'Bless the Child.'  I just can't help feeling offended as my religion is presented to the public in a twisted, totally out-of-whack way.

Being the son of the companies owner, he is pretty much in a cushy position, high paid, surrounded by other yuppies, goes to upscale restaurants, spends time in his high scale Manhattan apartments, and shmoozes with all his other same yuppie friends.  The only difference between him and all the others, is that Patrick is a serial killer.There's one thing I can say about villains in movies, we all secretly want them to win.  Bale in the yuppie peak of the 80's is surrounded by fakes, and jerkoffs, and other sick kind, so Bale fits right in.  Since he is a serial killer, he has no emotions NONE, and he blends in so easily with all his normal yuppie compatriots.  This is what makes this film unique, in that it's more of a statement on what the era was like than on Bale's horrible obsessions.Bale's acting is amazing in this role, playing such a complicated character. The murder scenes are filled with such tension, and the idea of chopping someone up into pieces whiles doing a soliloquy of why Huey Lewis's songs and music is so influential (which Bale's does as he usual waxes nostagicaly about 80's music while he's about to pounce on his victims) was just unreal.Interesting twist in the end as well.  However, there is only one interesting character in this film and everyone else is pretty plastic and uninteresting.  But I suppose that's the idea, thus making us feel no sympathy for any of these yuppie scums.Rating 7 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 October 2000","score":"","review":"  Bale plays Patrick Bateman, an upbeat all-with-it corporate business man working in Wall Street in the mid late 80's.

If you're a woman and don't understand guys at all, this can help you get a glimpse of how some guys think.  For the rest of us, this is a hilarious take on how people deal with the end of relationships.  The character, Rob, is very entertaining and the story is quite realistic.  Definitely worth a viewing or two.  Great soundtrack.  For me the funniest aspect was how into the music facts the main characters were.  Have you ever looked at someone as they rattle off facts about music, movies, or who was playing third base for the AL team in the 1975 World Series and think wow, do you have a life or do you just sit at home trying to memorize these facts?  This movie allows you to laugh at this as the guys argue about who, Jan or Dean, was the one who died in a car accident after the release of Dead Man's Curve.
