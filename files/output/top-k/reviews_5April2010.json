[{"date":"5 April 2010","score":"","review":" Sometimes a big thing starts small, like the proverbial snowflake that turns into an avalanche; big events are decided by small choices, moral and ethical, a theme which this clever film explores. It's a satire with no heroes or villains, only a series of petty grievances that add up to one ridiculous and barely noteworthy story. The treatment is what makes this film stand out, considering the story itself is very predictable and simple. So there isn't much surprise or awe, but a grim sense of understanding and belief.Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) is the popular social studies teacher in charge of overseeing the election for student body president, and Reese Witherspoon is an overzealous candidate who gets under Broderick's skin and inspires him to meddle. What's interesting is that McAllister's decisions have the broad stroke of an ethically defensible decision but morally the results are repugnant and embarrassing. He must stop her before it's too late -- really he's just upset that she'll probably climb much higher in life than he has. The sense of justice is what leads to his undoing. I also liked that the one deciding vote was cast for Tracy by her opponent, the hopelessly naive and good-hearted quarterback Paul (Chris Klein). There's something tragic in the way that he treats everyone around him so lovingly but he's treated with scorn because everyone resents his success as well (except again the dubious McAllister, who can't possibly resent someone with no brains).All in all I'd say this was one of the freshest comedies of the late 90s, more prescient and original than all the Austen\/Shakespeare teen movies floating around at that time, more like Heathers in the late 80s or Lord Love a Duck in the 60s. In this film, the high school is a primal battle ground where the rules for adult society are borne out of blood and toil. The director even uses one of Morricone's creepiest and most intense death-knell soundtrack bites (from the forgettable Burt Reynolds Western Navajo Joe) to emphasize the instinctive violence at play in the power struggle. No setting is too small for the grand emotions, no human decision important enough not to be sullied by pettiness and sad yearning perhaps intermingled (as in McAllister's barely comprehensible loyalty to his dorky friend who slept with Tracy).

This movie is really damn good and I enjoyed in every bit of it ! This were my verdicts after watching this movie . It maybe looks like I am maybe too late for reviewing this movie but it is classic movie and many generations will watch it . There are so good parts of this movie . When I compare it with other Batman movie I think that it is one of better . Maybe it isn't better than Nolan's movies but it is in better half . Actors are also very good .Tim Burton directed this movie and you can see his good imagination and I think that it is one of better directors for this kind of movies . I still can find his directing weapon which is very well used . Maybe he was in this movie too much that he forgot that there are some parts which are reminding me on some modern fairytale . I like his imagination and way how he wants to show imaginative side of the movie. He found himself in this movie.Michael Keaton as Batman maybe was too calm but his role was definitely one of most wanted roles in superhero movies . I wasn't maybe too happy because of his appearance in this movie but he surprised me . I was very happy because of the way how he acted this role . Keaton maybe looked sometimes confused in this movie but I don't think that he was confused . His way of acting maybe looked frivolous but it wasn't . He had to fit into Burton's vision of my favorite superhero .Jack Nicholson as Joker was the best part of this movie and he was so good . It isn't so easy to act some lunatic . He was very convincing and he is better Joker than Heath Ledger . Nicholson was maybe more crazy and he was real Joker from comic book . He was really good . I really appreciate Nicholson's spectra of acting . He was damn good and he really did his job very well .Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale was maybe not as good as Keaton and Nicholson but she had clear and maybe the easiest role in whole movie. I appreciate her acting but I don't think that she was in same level with two main characters . She looked like real example how to act some supporting role in this kind of movie . Burton really made this movie like he wanted . ","genre":null},{"date":"5 April 2010","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I really enjoyed in this movie!

There are other screen versions of this film ( possibly some of them yet to come), but this is the only one I have seen thus far, and I found it to be enlightening. While not completely faithful to the book ( possibly due to time and attention constraints), it does a respectable job of giving us the story from the horse's P.O.V., and I think it's probably easier for an animal to get inside of the head of a human than for a human to truly get inside of the mind of the animal--at least in life terms--but this is a very watchable movie. Some of you may want to have hankies and buckets at hand...it can be a tear-jerker at moments. I delayed watching the film because, sometimes, if it's told from the human perspective, it can get pretty mushy and sentimental...but this one is rather balanced, trying more to get the points and morals across than using sentiment as a weapon or a shield. I recommend it for the entire family.
