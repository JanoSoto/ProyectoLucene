An obese man is forced to eat till his stomach explodes. A corrupt and greedy lawyer has part of his belly pulled up and he is forced to eat it. These are just some of the rudest scenes of a violent and morbid film that was filmed in 1995 and attracted a lot of people around the whole world to the box offices, but it also created plenty of polemic. The film is already one of the best thrillers done and it follows the noir style, generating,this way,an almost unbearable sensation of mystery, tension and fear, but at the same time attractive. The story of the film is intriguing and touching detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) is sent to a new policemen's division in a violent metropolis (one of the great ideas of the plot is exactly not to mention in any moment the name of the city nor the year in which the story happens, making the show here more mysterious and intriguing ) and he has to team up with detective Sommerset (Morgan Freeman). It is obvious, from the first encounter among them,that the two don't understand each other and they don't like each other,but when a brutal series of murders begin to happen, following the seven capital sins, they are found in a situation in that they can either get join to hunt the violent serial killer or they won't be able to do nothing to stop the brutal crimes that are scaring the whole press around the world. And starting from that interesting and well-armed story several memorable and unforgettable scenes will happen, as the persecution in a full street, the talking and the thrill feeling between Tracy (Gwyneth Palthrow), the woman of Mills, and Sommerset in a restaurant, and the final climax that without a doubt is consecrated as the most shocking scene of film's history, and surprisingly this scene doesn't show anything concrete, but it suggests, what still turns everything more unbearable. Seven is an excellent film, a masterpiece directed with effectiveness by director David Fincher, who gets to ally a good plot and good sceneries (that explore the whole degrading aspect of the city the homosexuals, the prostitutes, the drug addicts) with the exquisite Darius Khondji's picture, that certainly reaches the excellence level that, for example, Vilmos Szigmond got in Deliverance. The only problem of Seven, that impedes it of consecrating itself as an absolute classic of the generô and to reign in the gallery in where the master Hitchcock's  films are, resides in the fact that the film gives away too soon the identity of the murderer. If perhaps the identity was surprising  the film would have shocked more, and it would become better. Even so Seven failed in that point, where it lacked more courage of the excellent film director David Fincher, but it achieved it's goal in many, many other points. But my analysis on the film only makes me to recommend it, and if you want yourself to be a part a  without- truces and breath-taking hunt,rent this film now!!!Seven is Rated R for grisly afterviews of horrific and bizarre killings, and for strong language; and it runs 123 minutes. The Cast Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, Gwyneth Palthrow and John C. McGinley.

It seems that the only type of movies that can rip off Pulp Fiction and still capture the essence of what made the first so good are movies directed by Quentin Tarantino and\/or based on an Elmore Leonard novel (2 Days in the Valley was amusing, but lacked depth and thought).  That's why Go is such a pleasure.  Sure, it's predictable at times (the no hands rule with the champagne was broken?  I saw that coming from a mile away) and at times a little hokey (Did Simon really need to discover Tantra in the hotel room?), but it still has what makes Pulp Fiction so great  Witty dialogue (the discussion about the Family Circus comic strip is hilarious) and a complex plot that interwieves its characters perfectly.  I hope that director Doug Liman and screenwriter John August do more projects in the future, hopefully together.

This perfect and unexpected follow-up to their popular and critical success Fargo is an absurdly loony movie that defies simple categorization. Is it a comedy, a thriller, a mystery, a neo-noir?  The truth is that, somehow, it's all of that--and a bag of chips.  More or less, it's about bowling, mistaken identity, and a soiled rug.  Jeff Bridges is so mellow, so cool as The Dude, and Julianne Moore, everybody's favorite indie darling (let's just forget The Lost World), is perfect as the mind-bogglingly bizarre Maude.  Look for appearances by all the usual suspects (John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro) as well as a few new friends.  The Big Lebowski celebrates coolness, hallucination, and nihilism, and it elevates bowling beyond the status of New Religion directly to The One True Faith.

Only now is he being redeemed historically for the very great corps commander that he was---one of the best in American History.I also was enamored with Sam Elliott's part as John Buford.  I like to think that Buford was every bit as fascinating in real life as Elliott played him in this picture.  Sam Elliott and Fess Parker both have the most distinctive and enchanting voices and I never cease to enjoy just hearing them talk in any movie they are in.
