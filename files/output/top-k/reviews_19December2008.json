Naming one single movie The Most Overrated Film of All Time is just ludicrous. But I am seriously reconsidering my own line of logic right now and giving this film that title. That is how much I simply cannot understand the hype and mass love for this film. At all. It's like a movie that should be on the bottom 100 movies of all time, but then somehow, some way, it gets loved by the public. I simply can't comprehend it.Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a generic film noir piece set in a generic film noir world with generic film noir quirky characters and a generic film noir plot. Everything, every last thing, is copy\/pasted from other&#151;better&#151;movies. Critics trash movies all the time for even minor unoriginality, yet this has to be one of the most unoriginal movies of all time and it's critically acclaimed? It's impossible not to see the unabashed rip-off scenes from Pulp Fiction, most notably. Not to mention the Reservoir Dogs inspired scenes. By the middle of the movie I literally forgot which wannabe Quentin Tarantino movie I was watching, because I've seen so many of them they all just blur together because they're all basically the same movie. They all repeat the same variations of Pulp Fiction quotes. They all have the same basic drug-kill-money plot. They all think they're so genius because they have one sub-par plot twist that isn't even a plot twist because we expect it in movies like this.Look, I like film noir, too, but I don't love everything just because it's a stylish crime movie. It has to be different. Film noir started back in the 40s, and I think it says something when the only few films in the genre that become anything more than a small cult success are the ones that are truly genre-defining and added much-needed originality to the genre, not the ones that just tag around the bandwagon.

It's generic. It's exactly like everything you've seen before. It's just a frozen McDonald's hamburger in the generic fast food storehouse. Get over it.If you're not a film noir fan, don't bother watching it at all. You'll fall asleep. If you are, and you're in a good mood, I suggest you try it. If the first five minutes bore you as much as they did me, just know that the rest of the movie doesn't get any better. The jokes are the same jokes you've heard in all the other genre pieces.

The classic 1960s series THE FUGITIVE, starring the perfectly cast David Janssen as somber, falsely accused Dr. Richard Kimble, has been one-upped by this 1993 masterpiece of an action-adventure film THE FUGITIVE, starring the rugged, unique Harrison Ford in the role of Kimble. Ford has similarities to Janssen, but there are also differences. Ford is much more burly and more of an intimidating presence than Janseen was and so you couldn't see Janssen kicking someone's ass the way Ford could. But Ford definitely does excellent job of capturing the calm, meek, quiet nature that Janssen so perfectly conveyed in the series, with added touches of desperation and fear. This is important as Kimble was always designed to be a 'regular everyday Joe', one of us. We HAVE to relate to him and sympathize with him and the more cocky, brutish characters that Ford has played in the past (Han Solo, Indiana Jones, etc.) have no part in this movie. I just hate that Ford didn't get a Best Actor nomination for this film as it is truly a performance deserving of one.The 2nd great performance in this already-classic film is that of Tommy Lee Jones, who truly came into his own with this movie. He won Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, but c'mon! We all know he was really the 2nd lead of this film. Jones plays Kimble's pursuer Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard (in the series it was Barry Morse playing Lt. Philip Gerard). About the only thing Jones and Morse have in common is that they are short men. That's about it! While Morse was much more calm and reserved as Gerard, Jones' Gerard is all out full-throttle, in-your-face, get-the-job-done-or-else version of the character. Full of juice throughout the entire film, Jones conveys a man obsessed with doing his job at whatever cost, but along the way, we get to see flashes of humanity and insight that makes us realize that Gerard isn't just some carbon copy blind cop. He begins to realize that maybe Kimble's assertion that he didn't kill his wife might be true. Kimble is a 'fugitive' and Gerard is fully within his right to arrest him and bring him in, whether Kimble is guilty of his convicted crime or not, but at the same time, Gerard's no-nonsense persona shines at welcome moments when he's dealing with people who are either buffoonish, deceptive, or apathetic. This is a key ingredient that makes this film work.Another brilliant aspect of this film is all the minor characters that Kimble encounters along the way, none of which have a big role, but all seem like actual people, just going about their everyday business. But none of these characters detract from the main plot of the film, thus THE FUGITIVE flows throughout.Like many great action films, the film contains some exciting scenes and set pieces (the train crash, the dam chase, the county jail chase, and the exciting climax with the one-armed man).Special mention should also go to the actors (Daniel Roebuck, L. Scott Caldwell, Tom Wood, and especially Joe Pantoliano), who play Gerard's deputies aiding him in the search for Kimble. The chemistry of this group is totally convincing and fun to watch and listen to.Andrew Davis directed this Best Picture nominee from 1993 and I would definitely rate it as one of the best films of the 1990s and one of the best action films ever!

Lethal Weapon 2 gives us further development of that relationship, but what you didn't necessarily expect was that the story and the action in the sequel would improve too. Well, Richard Donner and Joel Silver bring the heat once again in this sequel. It's just as witty and clever as the original and even more stuff explodes. The action even takes a turn from cool to serious as the bad guys (members of the South African consulate who use their diplomatic immunity to cover up their crimes) seem to be everywhere and taking everyone's life.

It really allows the film to pack in as much action as possible.Donner in the director's chair also deserves more accolades this time around.

Lethal Weapon 2 gives us further development of that relationship, but what you didn't necessarily expect was that the story and the action in the sequel would improve too. Well, Richard Donner and Joel Silver bring the heat once again in this sequel. It's just as witty and clever as the original and even more stuff explodes. The action even takes a turn from cool to serious as the bad guys (members of the South African consulate who use their diplomatic immunity to cover up their crimes) seem to be everywhere and taking everyone's life. You really don't like them at all. The film also deepens the humanity of Murtaugh and Riggs (specifically Riggs in this one) at the same time, which is pretty admirable for an action script back in the 1980s.The gunfire does get excessive at times and much like the original there's some crazy new scene unfolding around every corner with little lead in, but by some point in this film you just accept that as part of the Lethal Weapon universe--the bad guys are everywhere and there's always something going on. It really allows the film to pack in as much action as possible.Donner in the director's chair also deserves more accolades this time around. He simply gets how to weave action and drama by focusing on the characters a lot while also capturing the scope of the action sequences.Glover and Gibson really are a great tandem. They are both untypical for action heroes because they have such a wide range of emotions. They both joke around, take their jobs seriously at times, can be filled with hate or revenge and they truly know what's most important to them. Too many cops in films are one or two-dimensional but Shane Black's characters are not.Perhaps the only thing wrong with the film, other than it's odd racial undertones in tackling Apartheid South Africa, is that it forced writer Shane Black to walk away based on where Silver and Donner wanted to take their blooming franchise. Hard to argue with a gross more than double that of the original though.

Lots of the cast and crew involved with this movie 'fought' for the good cause during WW II and supported the troops abroad and rallied for cash bonds. For instance also Carole Lombard, who got killed before this movie got released, when the plane with her aboard crashed, when she returned from a tour selling war bonds.It's a movie that hits the mark with its comedy and spoofing elements, without ever getting a tiresome or overdone movie with its comedy and anti-Nazi themes. It's a more subtle done movie, thanks to its very fine written script.To me it really was the movie its script that pushed to movie to great heights. It's a movie that is always going and never stops for anything. It constantly puts its characters in some odd and also often dangerous situations. Just when you think its over they are rolling right into another- even bigger problem, which of course also is all the more hilarious as well. Because of this the movie basically gets better by the minute. It already all begins really well but it ends even better. You'll laugh more and more as the movie heads toward its ending.It also has a real original concept of a group of Polish actors fighting the Nazi invaders with the help of their acting abilities. So its Hamlet against Hitler in this movie! It makes this an original and really pleasant movie to watch. Even though it of course is about serious subjects, especially considering that the movie got made during WW II itself and has some deeper political meanings to it, it never becomes a heavy movie to watch. It's like laughing at WW II during WW II itself. It shows that the world was not entirely dark and sober during WW II.

One thing that often is great about '40's and also '30's comedies is its written dialog. It provides the movie with plenty of laughs and makes you wonder why writers like this are not involved with comedy-writing now days. Probably because the genre has got less prestige now days, when compared to the '40's especially, when basically each year a movie like this got nominated for plenty of Oscar's. Strangely enough this movie received only one nomination though, for its music. Perhaps this was due to the movie its bad release date, not too long after Pearl Harbor and of course also Carole Lombard's early death.The movie has a solid '40's cast with talented actors such as Carole Lombard, Jack Benny, Robert Stack and Lionel Atwill involved.

I found the movie so captivating that it totally disarmed any thoughts of criticism I might have.Young Patrick Fugit plays William Miller (the stand-in for Crowe), and his performance is most impressive, particularly given that it is his first in a full length movie. He plays the part of the earnest young journalist with heartfelt sincerity. I am sure that landing the responsibility on Fugit to essentially carry this movie was a gamble on Crowe's part, but it paid off handsomely. The film is filled with some truly wonderful performances. Francis McDormand plays William's mother, a university professor who is concerned about her son's zeal for the devil rock 'n' roll, and concerned about his wanting to be in the scene as a journalist. McDormand has a great sense of comedic timing while all the time playing a serious person. A large part of her success is that she is given some great lines. When she drops William off at a rock concert as the crowds are entering the arena she comments, Look at this, an entire generation of Cinderrella's, and there is no slipper coming. And, after William does not show up on an agreed upon schedule, she announces to her class, Rock stars have kidnapped my son! But the quality that most endears her to us is that she so loves her son that she is not going to stand between him and his passion. Philip Seymour Hoffman gives a marvelous performance as the over-the-top rock critic Lester Bangs, who is a mentor for William. Add to this an Oscar-nominated performance by Kate Hudson as a groupie and good work by Billy Crudup, Jason Lee, Anna Paquin, and Noah Taylor and you have one hell of a cast.But another star is the rock music soundtrack. If this music was the soundtrack of your youth, then you will find this film irresistible; if not, maybe it will open you up to a new appreciation.An acid trip, a drug overdose, and the complications of lax sexual behavior are touched on, but not in a way that seriously intrudes on the overall good feelings evoked.I hated to see this end. There are many memorable scenes, like the group sing of Elton John's Tiny Dancer on the bus. And Kate Hudson's solitary dance on an empty stage after a successful concert, to the music of Cat Stevens' The Wind, is priceless. I just wish that that scene had gone on a lot longer.Ultimately William faces a bit of a moral dilemma. He has grown to like the band he is writing about and has become somewhat of a mascot to them.

I found the movie so captivating that it totally disarmed any thoughts of criticism I might have.Young Patrick Fugit plays William Miller (the stand-in for Crowe), and his performance is most impressive, particularly given that it is his first in a full length movie. He plays the part of the earnest young journalist with heartfelt sincerity. I am sure that landing the responsibility on Fugit to essentially carry this movie was a gamble on Crowe's part, but it paid off handsomely. The film is filled with some truly wonderful performances. Francis McDormand plays William's mother, a university professor who is concerned about her son's zeal for the devil rock 'n' roll, and concerned about his wanting to be in the scene as a journalist. McDormand has a great sense of comedic timing while all the time playing a serious person. A large part of her success is that she is given some great lines. When she drops William off at a rock concert as the crowds are entering the arena she comments, Look at this, an entire generation of Cinderrella's, and there is no slipper coming. And, after William does not show up on an agreed upon schedule, she announces to her class, Rock stars have kidnapped my son! But the quality that most endears her to us is that she so loves her son that she is not going to stand between him and his passion. Philip Seymour Hoffman gives a marvelous performance as the over-the-top rock critic Lester Bangs, who is a mentor for William. Add to this an Oscar-nominated performance by Kate Hudson as a groupie and good work by Billy Crudup, Jason Lee, Anna Paquin, and Noah Taylor and you have one hell of a cast.But another star is the rock music soundtrack. If this music was the soundtrack of your youth, then you will find this film irresistible; if not, maybe it will open you up to a new appreciation.An acid trip, a drug overdose, and the complications of lax sexual behavior are touched on, but not in a way that seriously intrudes on the overall good feelings evoked.I hated to see this end. There are many memorable scenes, like the group sing of Elton John's Tiny Dancer on the bus. And Kate Hudson's solitary dance on an empty stage after a successful concert, to the music of Cat Stevens' The Wind, is priceless. I just wish that that scene had gone on a lot longer.Ultimately William faces a bit of a moral dilemma. He has grown to like the band he is writing about and has become somewhat of a mascot to them.

Does it hold up, with the presence of Steve McQueen, Faye Dunaway, Jack Weston, and Norman Jewison? Man, I wish it did! Well, it sort of holds up. The first 30 minutes does, anyway, with a bank robbery sequence featuring Weston, McQueen, Yaphet Kotto, and three D. B. Cooper lookalikes. Actually, this is where director Jewison makes his strongest push for a solid crime thriller, in the opening 30 minutes, before Dunaway shows up. After that, through no fault of hers, its all downhill.McQueen is Thomas Crown, a Boston brahmin businessman in a three-piece suit and comfortable living quarters with a predilication for taking advantage of others. You overpaid is the way he breaks it to a group of businessmen he makes a deal with at the picture's outset, and that's his style through the rest of the film, whether it's telling bank-robbery associate Jack Weston why he shouldn't wonder about things (No questions. What you don't know can't hurt you. You or me, Erwin boy) or investigator Faye Dunaway why she should just forego her job of sleuthing out the truth and hang with him in Europe for an extended vacation.I'm a big Steve McQueen fan, but this time around I cared more about what happened to Jack Weston's character. This factored into why I liked The Thomas Crown Affair less than I wanted to. Steve McQueen is great when he's a badass, except when he's making too much of that fact. Thomas Crown makes too much of that fact.Is it immoral to like a film that celebrates how the well-off take advantage of the less so? Well, I say so. Crown, an already rich guy who wants more, is certainly a questionable hero. So's Dunaway's Miss Vicki, an insurance investigator who maybe falls in love with Crown while trying to figure out whether he's the mastermind behind the big Boston bank robbery with which the film opens. After a while, I was hoping the pair would catch VD. Was I at fault, or them?Oh, and I really don't like the title song, performed by Rex Harrison's son Nigel without the benefit of Daddy explaining where the virtues of talk-singing ended. A circle in a spiral\/A wheel within a wheel\/Never ending, never beginning, in an ever spinning reel\/As the images unwind\/Like the circles that you find\/In the windmills of your mind. Did that really pass for profound in the '60s somehow? The basis of Thomas Crown Affair is that crime pays, at least it did the 1960s, with Jewison directing and Haskell Wexler doing the cinematography. Watching McQueen and Dunaway riding a dune buggy on Cape Cod is to feel intimately connected with the 1960s, in a way no other Dunaway nor McQueen film does. That's not only what's good but what's great about this film.But crime DOES pay, watching this film. Crown is a rascal, but not unlikably so. His relationship with Miss Vicki doesn't suffer from too much hand-holding, just cooking lobsters in the sand and taking the proper measure of one another. I wished McQueen's interest in bank robbery was more in line with the involuntary kind practiced in The Getaway, but he's not a total bounder, and there's a strong enough suggestion of his taking a different path with Miss Vicki so as not to totally turn you against the zeitgeist of this film.It's just that I wish the film had more going for it than a caper romance. However solidly '60s, it would have been nicer if The Thomas Crown Affair made it somehow more enjoyable to enjoy its sumptuous cinematography, its images of Boston in midsummer, its hang-gliding with gorgeous ladies in skimpy underwear.The Thomas Crown Affair is a fun film, and one of the most beautiful McQueen ever made.

Every role is impeccably filled, from Richard Gere and Julia Robers in the leads, all the way to Abdul Salaam El Razzac as the Happy Man (Welcome to Hollywood, what's your dream?). Yes, the story is catchy and the screenplay is wonderful, but what makes this movie so compelling is the way absolutely every role contributes to the overall tapestry, a tribute to Garry Marshall's attention to detail. Laura San Giacomo, Jason Alexander and Hector Elizondo are at their best in supporting roles, and even the bit parts - Elinor Donohue as Bridget the saleswoman, James Patrick Steward as the bellboy, R.

Perhaps it's the fact that based on the plot, it's intended to be deceptive cross-dressing, or maybe it's simply because Dustin Hoffman is such a prominent male actor that it gave the concept a renewed intrigue. Either way, there's no doubt that Tootsie played a role in redefining character acting in movies.The film stars Hoffman as Michael Dorsey, an actor who has been out of work and according to his agent, played by the film's director Sydney Pollack, is impossible to work with. To prove everyone wrong, he takes on the guise of Dorothy Michaels and lands a part on a daytime soap opera. Not only does being a woman change Michael's perspective, but he also happens to fall for the show's leading lady (Jessica Lange).Hoffman truly steals this film. He's incredibly convincing as Dorothy while also nailing the ignorant, conceited fool that is Michael. While the script could better show how his dual life changes his perspective as a man, Hoffman makes the most out of it. His versatility is astounding. Tootsie also brags an impressive supporting cast that aside from Oscar- winning Lange includes Bill Murray as Michael's odd roommate, Charles Durning and Teri Garr.As a comedy, Tootsie is not exactly laugh-out-loud funny. There are some classic lines, but most of the jokes comes from the plot itself and how the events unfold. As a drama, it sort of acts as the first film to make feminism a central theme. The goal of the film in one sense is sort of to address feminism, or at least what at the time was sort of the growing movement among women to claim back their independence and womanhood. By creating a character who is a man both literally and figuratively walking in a woman's shoes and surrounding him with a couple women characters struggling with their independence, the writers have set up an interesting perspective for audiences to look at the differences between men and women. Seeing men hit on Dorothy not knowing she's a man is humorous but also eye-opening.On the comedy\/drama spectrum, Tootsie might clearly belong on the comedy side, but neither aspect of the film is too extreme. It's a comedy that tries to reveal some of the most basic struggles that people in the working world deal with every day that often aren't at the center of attention in both our lives and on the silver screen.

It is not a biopic, but a snapshot of the affair between Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine. For the artistically minded to question love and the insanity of genius, and not to follow the significant footsteps of the bohemian poets. However, it fails due to a kind of Americanisation of period costume drama. There is a mishmash of accents (American, British, French) undermining the nuance of the French tongue. I still can't understand why trained actors don't seem to have even a basic grasp of high school French, or why the producers and the director were scared of subtitles in an 'Art house' film. It's difficult to buy DiCaprio as Rimbaud (although in appearance he is well cast) as with an American accent he always seems obnoxious even when it is not his intention. Delivering fragments of Rimbaud's poems and philosophy in sound bites renders them hollow. Although he is aesthetically and historically on the mark, the tone and spirit of the portrayal is completely wrong.Another conceit is that this film marginalises Verlaine. The opening interstitial might as well read Verlaine's poems were OK, but who cares? Arthur was known to have an admiration for Verlaine long before the two met, and the love between them genuine. Here though, it is painted as a vampiric relationship of convenience. Paul clinging to Arthur for fear of being alone, Arthur bleeding Paul's influence and money dry.Hackneyed scenes of Rimbaud having 'visions' of the final years of his life had me gagging, and are inexcusable. The editing of the entire piece is atrocious, particularly Paul's trial. And there are inaccuracies for the sake of ludicrous symbolism. Verlaine shot Rimbaud in the wrist. Though as it is portrayed here, he is shot through the center of his hand, to tack on a gauche Christ metaphor. You are never assimilated into the world these people live in because of the accent problem, and the energies of every cast member shooting off in different directions. Making the effort, you will find yourself wanting to like this film more than it will allow you to. The intention is to make you cry at the end, as other critics attest, but I fail to see how.Total Eclipse tried very hard to alienate its audience, the problem is that it has largely succeeded. It sours the romantic notion of Rimbaud and Verlaine for those familiar with their work, and has the unfamiliar asking basic straightforward questions which it makes no attempt to answer. Why would Verlaine keep putting up with Rimbaud's abuse, Why was Rimbaud considered a genius? He seemed like an arsehole.
