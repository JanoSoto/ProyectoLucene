Some points I might add..- The movie is losely based on the Judas Priest story but if you know your Judas Priest none of the movie is really accuarate.  Halford left priest on his own doing and was not fired.- First off Herek should have used somebody other than Walhberg to play the part of hero, given Mark's past as a 'rapper' and having no real knowledge of such a situation involving heavy metal singing (movie or not).- Keep in mind the movie takes place about the mid 80s (say 84-86 max) yet while the soundtrack is good, some of the actual songs in the soundtrack were written\/recorded much later than the supposed time frame of the movie (Bon Jovi - Slippery When Wet in 1986, Motley Crue Wildside in 1987, and AC\/DC Are You Ready in 1990).  Sloppily done and researched.- Accoring to the movie, Izzy (Wahlberg) comes in to replace Beers about 1985, does a few tours, puts out one album, and then seeminngly walks out within a two year time zone.  Again, sloppily done given what real life is. Even some of the worst of the many replacement singers that have come in to many a 'real-life' metal bands had a tenure of much more than just 2-3 years (recording a new album and a subsquent tour alone often takes up more than a year).

(Again, the timing thing.  Alternative music didnt explode until really the mid 90s and the movie has him doing this at maybe 1990 the latest, back when hair metal was still ruling).

The story centers on two men living very different life styles who through a quirk of fate, meet as the result of a traffic accident. Both it turns out, are headed to the court house for different reasons. Ben Affleck plays an arrogant self-centered Wall Street lawyer named Gavin Banek. He is going to court to represent his firm's takeover of child's trust fund. Samuel L. Jackson on the other hand plays Doyle Gipson who is headed to court for a custody battle with his wife (Kim Stauton) over their children. The accident changes both men's lives forever. Banek leaves Gipson stranded on the freeway but doesn't notice that he has dropped a file with information crucial to his case. Gipson arrives late for his court date after the judge has awarded custody of the children to his wife. Banek is given the rest of the day to produce the missing file in court and Gipson is distraught over the loss of his children. Banek, in an effort to force Gipson to turn over the file with the help of a colleague and former lover (Toni Collette - having a REAL BAD hair day), hires a computer hacker to effectively bankrupt Gipson and destroy his credit. Gipson on the other hand, tries to cause Banek to have a serious traffic accident to exact his revenge. Banek has to explain all of this to his boss and father-in-law Stephen Delano (Sydney Pollack) who arranges to fix things. Gipson now finds he is bankrupt and cannot get the loan that was approved so that he could buy a house in order to keep his children in New York. The film is fine to this point. In the last quarter everyone suddenly comes to their collective senses and Director Roger Michell takes us through yet another lives happily ever after Hollywood ending.

The story centers on two men living very different life styles who through a quirk of fate, meet as the result of a traffic accident. Both it turns out, are headed to the court house for different reasons. Ben Affleck plays an arrogant self-centered Wall Street lawyer named Gavin Banek. He is going to court to represent his firm's takeover of child's trust fund. Samuel L. Jackson on the other hand plays Doyle Gipson who is headed to court for a custody battle with his wife (Kim Stauton) over their children. The accident changes both men's lives forever. Banek leaves Gipson stranded on the freeway but doesn't notice that he has dropped a file with information crucial to his case. Gipson arrives late for his court date after the judge has awarded custody of the children to his wife. Banek is given the rest of the day to produce the missing file in court and Gipson is distraught over the loss of his children. Banek, in an effort to force Gipson to turn over the file with the help of a colleague and former lover (Toni Collette - having a REAL BAD hair day), hires a computer hacker to effectively bankrupt Gipson and destroy his credit. Gipson on the other hand, tries to cause Banek to have a serious traffic accident to exact his revenge. Banek has to explain all of this to his boss and father-in-law Stephen Delano (Sydney Pollack) who arranges to fix things. Gipson now finds he is bankrupt and cannot get the loan that was approved so that he could buy a house in order to keep his children in New York. The film is fine to this point.

The mistakes and flaws in the film were made that much more obvious with a second-viewing I nearly had to gouge my eyes out in spite of its sheer medicority and utter ridiculousness.I tried to like this film... it was, after all, based on the cheesy video game from Japan that had some pretty good moments. I guess it was too much of a task to have both actors and a script in a movie even though Anderson has made some horrible films with some decent acting (Event Horizon) or cheesy acting with a pretty good film (Mortal Kombat). Resident Evil has neither. The plot is generic, and serves only as an excuse to develop a senseless sequel, have Milla pose half-nude (to appease the RE fans I figure) and have plenty of zombies go ballistic. With some stretch of the imagination this COULD be tolerable and FUN but there are two very glaring mistakes in the film that stand out like a leper in a crowd1) Their choice of Actors - Cheesy, screwed up action films have only 2 saviors, excellent action sequences (to some degree), and at least average acting. Brotherhood of the Wolf, as ridiculous of a story as it was, had very decent acting and incredibly well-done sequences and cinematography. Resident Evil, with its silly storyline, had characters with the uncanny power to read their lines off script cards. Impressive. Can they act that horribly, or did they put effort into it? The leader of this ragtag bunch of soldiers was pretty cool. He could deliver all of his lines in monotone and display one facial expression. Needless to say, he was killed off quick. In fact, nearly all of the useless soldiers were killed off quickly (just like John Carpenter's Vampires) which I guess was a plus for Anderson. Michelle Rodriguez, playing in vain as the Vasquez-hack of Aliens (more about this later), tops him by emoting one emotion along with her delivery of lines in monotone. Sad, she was wasted in this film. A myriad of other characters share this same profile, including the dear Milla who can kill zombies with martial arts even though an entire clip of a MP5 will do nothing. By the way, why was she trained to do this? She could kick some serious behind for no explicable reason yet her partner\/husband (this was never explained either) had none of the training? I assume all of this was discarded to ensure the people will return for the explanation in the sequel. At the other end of the spectrum, we also have Eric Mabius, who could display two emotions... slightly confused, and very confused.

A plot full of twists.  A director on his way up.  And Patterson wrote the screenplay, which makes the end film even more surprising.  All but the most blatant plot twists have been cut out so what we're left with is your average thriller.  Soneji starts out as a refreshingly believable killer - in fact, he's pretty normal - but then degenerates into a cliche'd raving loony.  The murder on the boat is commited as if Soneji were just killing a bird, which gives a stark realism to the film.  But it's not all bad.  The studio re-shot the ending (and boy does it show) but when the film is good, it's great Morgan Freeman can do no wrong and the cinematography is slick and Monica Potter is a real find.  If only the studio had had the guts to trust the audience's intelligence, this could have been the thriller to end all thrillers.  Read the book.

The idea of love that is 'like magic' is a dream for so many - it's bound to be liked by the middle class-higher educated-single -and married- females ... and to others, too. The cast - not often we can find two brilliant actors to be allowed to play sensitive and intelligent human beings, allowing us to get into the world of their fears, longings and hopes. Adding the character of Jonah - what a winner! Last but not least - THE MUSIC of this movie is unbelievable! Very often I ask myself 'Why didn't I like this or that movie so much like 'Sleepless in Seatle?' and the answer has been - the music !!!

Finally somebody has done it correctly.  I'm not just talking about the prehistoric animals that are shown here, I'm also talking about the excellent plot and character development.  And, of course, the music.The plot is not quite as simple as you'd think.  It's not a story in which the animals simply get loose and go on a rampage.  No, Jurassic Park is much more than that, with several subplots that, rather than tying you into a web, simply keep you interested by holding everything together.The CGI is simply amazing.  Tying it into real life must have been difficult, yet the animators did a superb job.  I was impressed at how smoothly these animals moved, how realistic they seemed although nobody living has seen one.  Seamless integration always catches my attention.The actors are a major factor of this movie.  Jeff Goldblum is perfect as the twitty scientist who knows more than everybody thinks he does.  Sam Neill, too, is perfect for his role as Alan Grant.  The other actors, though not as amazing as these two, hold up their own characters excellently.The music, composed by John Williams, has an excellent theme.  Probably one of the greatest in the century.  It could almost be a love theme, but strays from the sappy tunes and goes to a mysterious, joyful tune of admiration for these animals that will enthrall any listener.Jurassic Park is most definitely one of my most favorite movies of all time.  It combines science and logic with nature and survival.  It isn't a brainless killing spree.  No, it's an intellectual dive into the modern nature of our own world.My advice?  Watch it.  Buy it on DVD.  It's nearly perfect.
