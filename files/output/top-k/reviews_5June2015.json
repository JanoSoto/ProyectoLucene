[{"date":"5 June 2015","score":"","review":" Shrek (2001) Dir Andrew Adamson, Vicky Jenson \/ Voices Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, John Lithgow, Vincent Cassel Computer generated pleasure that violates all of those fairy tale clichés that we grew up with. Shrek is an ogre secluded in the woods who scares anyone who disrupts his life. Lord Farquaad could become King but only if he has a Princess. He sets his sights on Princess Fiona who is secluded in a castle guarded by a dragon. Shrek accepts the task in order that all the fairy tale characters that have landed on his property be rid of. Conclusion is questionable depending on one's preference towards Fiona. Directors Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson have familiarized themselves with the clichés and exploit them. Mike Myers voices Shrek who dislikes human contact but takes upon this task in hopes to regain his privacy. Eddie Murphy brings hilarity to Donkey whom Shrek saves. Donkey will become involved in a twisted relationship by the conclusion. Cameron Diaz is hilarious as Fiona whose personality is feisty but she conceals a secret. John Lithgow voices tyrant Farquaad, a little man attempting to conquer big things such as torturing the Gingerbread Man. Vincent Cassel voices a French version of Robin Hood, which should impress upon the legacy of Errol Flynn. Wonderful and original images make for a laugh-filled adventure that exposes all others.

I've seen some really great stories, and some really terrible ones. And I can say with little hesitation that this film is my favorite. The story is well-told. The pacing is good, taking time to build the characters as relatable (if often flawed) people, but not slowing down the story. The plot is a lot darker and sadder than typical animated fare, with a bit more violence than most of us are used to seeing in animation. This isn't a bad thing by any means--it gives the story a bit more impact than it would otherwise have.The visual appearance of The Prince of Egypt is gorgeous. The characters are emotional and believable, and the landscape is huge and impressive. I won't tell you any specifics in case you don't know the story of Moses and don't want spoilers, but suffice to say that it all looks incredible, especially the miracles.But what really pulls it all together is the soundtrack. Without it, the film would still be good. With it, the film is outstanding. The songs fit perfectly, whether they're about desperation, or regret, or hope. They sound as huge and majestic as the animation looks, or maybe even outshine the animation. Whether you are Christian or not, you can appreciate this masterpiece. It's a Bible story, sure, but Dreamworks made a great effort to adapt it in a way that respected the original, while still appealing to those of other beliefs as well. They succeeded. The Prince of Egypt is an excellently told, powerful story that anyone can love.
