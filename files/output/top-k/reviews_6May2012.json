If I had seen this movie as a kid my imagination would have gone wild. When I was younger, I was always into the whole Treasure Hunting thing, always making clues and hiding them and having other's find them. The Goonies is basically a treasure hunt, and it's a damn good one too. I watched this mostly just because people were saying how great it was, and how it was one of the movies that inspired one of my favorite films from last year Super 8. Well before I praise this movie, first let me say a few things that bothered me.The character of Chunk, the fat kid, doesn't go in the caves with the rest of the group, and in the last act, we barely see him. Which is a shame. Also some parts seemed a little too adult, I could handle the skeletons, but I can't really see why they put in the scene with the statue's genitals falling off. Also Data's accent got annoying at times, he sounds like Short Round from Temple of Doom. But this movie really put a smile on my face, it's a classic adventure movie about finding a treasure. Like I said, I loved that stuff when I was younger, so this really brought a nostalgia feeling. The characters are great, sure they all fit into a stereotype fat, Asian, cool, leader, but they all are so funny and likable. I like that they have both kids and teenagers on this journey. That way more people can relate. The villains are great, and the film had me laughing tons of times. I could say more, but I assume most of you have seen this film, and if you haven't, go watch it.The Goonies isn't quite as good as E.T., Close Encounters, or Super 8, but it's still a fun, nostalgic, and very funny ride. I will be buying this as soon as I can and it will go right on my shelf along with those other three.

When it comes to these type of movies they're always uneven simply because you have different styles and so forth but I always ask myself if any of the shorts are good enough to where you'd want to see them expanded into features and in the case here only the first film would be worthy. Even though all three films open with credits that tell you who directed them, anyone familiar with their work would be able to tell even without the credits.Martin Scorsese's Life Lessons features an artist (Nick Nolte) struggling to find his painting in time for his big release party but while trying to finish up he's also struggling to find a connection with his assistant (Rosanna Arquette) who he has been having a sexual affair with. This here is without question the best of the three films because you have a fairly interesting story that is perfectly directed. I really loved the way that Scorsese never really explains what the story is and instead he just gives us little pieces and hints as the film moves along. It also doesn't hurt that you've got Nolte giving a terrific performance as he doesn't have to say much but you can see everything in his face. Arquette is also very good in her role as is Steve Buscemi in his brief part. The real star here however is editor Thelma Shoonmaker who does some of her greatest work here. This is especially true during the painting sequences, which are just downright beautifully filmed and the way they are edited is just something masterful to watch.Francis Ford Coppola's Life Without Zoe is the worst of the bunch and centers on a lonely 12-year-old girl (Heather McComb) who doesn't have any real friends until one day she meets the richest boy in school who is also friendless. I've seen this film a few times now and I keep hoping that it eventually makes sense but it never does. This is a pretty bad movie on so many levels but the majority of the blame has to go to Coppola because the story makes very little sense and his direction is so lifeless that you really wonder if even he cared about what was going on. Right from the start it's just impossible to get caught up in the story, the characters or to really care about anything that's going on. McComb gives a very good performance in the lead and Talia Shire isn't too bad as her mother but the film on the whole is just bad.Woody Allen's Oedipus Wrecks) features Allen playing a 50-year-old lawyer who still can't get away from his mother. One day he introduces his mother to his fiancé (Mia Farrow) and the three take her kids to a magic act where the mother mysteriously disappears. A few days later she re-appears over the skies of New York City where she starts telling all of her son's secrets and embarrassing him even more. I think this third film has a few interesting moments and it has a rather clever idea but in the end it just never fully comes together. I never thought any of the embarrassing stories that the mother tells were all that funny and I'd say more than anything they're just annoying. Even Allen, the actor, doesn't appear to be at the top of his game as this character is just something that feels tiresome. Farrow isn't much better as she just sleepwalks through her part.NEW YORK STORIES, in the end, is a pretty disappointing affair with only Scorsese's film really coming to life and being something worthy. The Coppola short is one of the worst things he's ever done and the Allen film isn't too bad but it's just rather lifeless compared to the director's other films.

To better understand Nazism's rise, one must understand the trauma of the 1918 Armistice on German people BUT to comprehend the French diktat of Versailles in 1919, one must also take into consideration the trauma of the French defeat against the Prussian Army in 1870. Following the same logic, History is the never-ending chronicles of successive traumas turning yesterday's losers into today's winners.But blood sometimes dries quicker than History books' ink, and while we're allowed to judge an event in a more rational and reasonable way, it leads to a very singular paradox if you deprive your analysis from its emotional substance, you get more objective, rational, yet it can undermine your very comprehension of further events, because men make the events, and most of the times, they're guided by the weight of a traumatic experience -every act of terror takes its roots in another one- but then, if you use emotion, you lose the objectivity, which is the key element in science. To put it in simpler words one death is a tragedy, one million is statistics, statistics are more relevant to understand the present but only tragedy can help to anticipate the future. A film like Sophie's Choice focuses on one tragedy to better highlight the gravity of a much more large-scaled tragic chapter of Human history the Holocaust and its profound effect on people's minds. The world indeed would never be the same after 1945.But I'm still perplexed about the film. It tells the story of a young woman who survived the atrocities of the Concentration Camps and had to make one of the most horrific choices that was ever allowed to a mother choosing which of her children would survive. The irony is that she's given this very privilege because she's not Jewish, she's a Catholic and what's more, not a communist, yet she would have to live with a terrible weight in her conscience, something that a Jewish mother wouldn't have to endure because she would be forced to lose her children. Another irony occurs when we discover Sophie's romance with Nathan, an American Jew, we're shocked seeing treated her as a whore for Germans, no matter how sick or demented he was. As I said, it's only through shock that you can comprehend the atrocity of an event. That Nathan carried this pain in his heritage because he was a Jew is one thing but it would be insulting to those who really lived the experience, to distribute the share of guilt and sorrow in the hearts of people who didn't live it, regardless of their ethnic background.So, I'm trying to figure out what the clear purpose of Sophie's story is? I try to imagine what was Alan J. Pakula's thinking when he decided to make the film. He probably thought that it would be great to have a film depicting one of the most horrific and painful dilemmas ever, carried by a marvelous performance from Meryl Streep, who was in her path for cinematic glory. Then, she'd have to tell her story in flashback, because the choice would only work if it came late in a film, to let us sense a trauma hidden inside her heart. But something must provoke the confession; it must be about children, then Stingo, the young idealistic writer, played by Peter MacNicol must ask Sophie for marrying her. Step by step, we get to the necessity of featuring this sort of triangular love between three friends, Nathan, Sophie's lover, Sophie, a Polish Auschwitz survivor with a lovable accent, and the sweet and naive Southern boy who'll naturally fall in love with them, mirroring their very passion for American literature. The promise of the film is carried by three spectacular performances and a sweet and tender score, but I failed to connect the story to the flashbacks and I wonder what the results would have been if the story was simply about Sophie's experience.The movie is guided by Nathan's weird behavior, Sophie's attempts to speak the most correct English, and Stingo's passive observations, the whole thing enrobed by a sort of back-story involving a passion for English and literature. The feelings driven by these parts go from amusing to infuriating, we're touched by Stingo's sweetness, frustrated by Nathan's lunacy and impressed or not by Meryl Streep's remarkable performance. There's a sort of lightness floating in the air that efficiently contrasts with the darkness of the flashback, but when the flashback started, I felt the weakness of the first hour and half that immediately felt like an overlong set-up and made me wonder what was so special to make this film in the American Film Institute's Top 100? One spectacular moment can redeem a whole film &#x85; or is it just because it's a Holocaust story &#x85; or a coming of age story of a kid who discovered the world's sudden cruelty from Sophie's trauma? Hadn't he heard about writers like Sartre or Camus who expressed their angst toward a world that allowed the Holocaust to happen and accept the idea of a Nuclear bomb wiping out Japanese civilians?To the choice, yes, it remains one of the most heart-breaking moments in cinema's history as I was haunted by the genuinely frightened look of Sophie's daughter and her piercing cries while she was taken in the misty dark under the powerless look of Sophie. Yes, Meryl Streep deserved the Award for that very part. But the rest belonged to another film, and instead of making another 'Holocaust' story, which I'm sure, would have been extraordinary, I trust Pakula's talent for that. He chose the option of a character study but he thinks too much of us on that level, because all the intelligibility of the world can't get over the shock deeply rooted in the experience.

He probably thought that it would be great to have a film depicting one of the most horrific and painful dilemmas ever, carried by a marvelous performance from Meryl Streep, who was in her path for cinematic glory. Then, she'd have to tell her story in flashback, because the choice would only work if it came late in a film, to let us sense a trauma hidden inside her heart. But something must provoke the confession; it must be about children, then Stingo, the young idealistic writer, played by Peter MacNicol must ask Sophie for marrying her. Step by step, we get to the necessity of featuring this sort of triangular love between three friends, Nathan, Sophie's lover, Sophie, a Polish Auschwitz survivor with a lovable accent, and the sweet and naive Southern boy who'll naturally fall in love with them, mirroring their very passion for American literature. The promise of the film is carried by three spectacular performances and a sweet and tender score, but I failed to connect the story to the flashbacks and I wonder what the results would have been if the story was simply about Sophie's experience.The movie is guided by Nathan's weird behavior, Sophie's attempts to speak the most correct English, and Stingo's passive observations, the whole thing enrobed by a sort of back-story involving a passion for English and literature. The feelings driven by these parts go from amusing to infuriating, we're touched by Stingo's sweetness, frustrated by Nathan's lunacy and impressed or not by Meryl Streep's remarkable performance. There's a sort of lightness floating in the air that efficiently contrasts with the darkness of the flashback, but when the flashback started, I felt the weakness of the first hour and half that immediately felt like an overlong set-up and made me wonder what was so special to make this film in the American Film Institute's Top 100? One spectacular moment can redeem a whole film &#x85; or is it just because it's a Holocaust story &#x85; or a coming of age story of a kid who discovered the world's sudden cruelty from Sophie's trauma? Hadn't he heard about writers like Sartre or Camus who expressed their angst toward a world that allowed the Holocaust to happen and accept the idea of a Nuclear bomb wiping out Japanese civilians?To the choice, yes, it remains one of the most heart-breaking moments in cinema's history as I was haunted by the genuinely frightened look of Sophie's daughter and her piercing cries while she was taken in the misty dark under the powerless look of Sophie. Yes, Meryl Streep deserved the Award for that very part. But the rest belonged to another film, and instead of making another 'Holocaust' story, which I'm sure, would have been extraordinary, I trust Pakula's talent for that. He chose the option of a character study but he thinks too much of us on that level, because all the intelligibility of the world can't get over the shock deeply rooted in the experience.

She quickly left acting behind and did not have many acting gigs afterwards. Luckily she has found her calling as a director-writer, starting with her adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides' debut novel.In a wealthy suburb in 1970s Michigan there are five sisters, Therese (Leslie Hayman), Mary (A.J. Cook), Bonnie (Chelse Swain), Lux (Kirsten Dunst) and Cecilia (Hanna R. Hall) who live with their authoritarian, religious parents (James Woods and Kathleen Turner). But tragedy strikes when 13-year-old Cecila kills herself. Watching them from a far are a group of neighbourhood boys as the tragedy unfolds and watches as Lux falls for local heartthrob Trip (Josh Hartnett) and the boys try to put the pieces of the puzzle of what happened to the girls.The Virgin Suicides is a tackles a dark subject and Coppola juxtaposes it with a bright, dreamy visual with a golden filter, sun dearth landscapes and dreamy editing and she keeps the girls at a distance. We do know much of the girls or why they did what they do. Admittedly I would have wanted to see the girls given more personality and be recognisable; it is only Lux we get to see or know. But I will give Coppola credit that despite not seeing the details we see the boys seeing Lux really descent down a dark path. This is a film about not knowing what happens behind closed doors, about restricting girls' social outlets and trying to dominate their lives just makes a pressured situation that is ready to go off and the ever changing nature of what it is like to be a teenager. It is particularly dark because one of the first scenes is a 13-year-old lying in a blood filled bath and it makes you wonder what would drive someone that young into doing something that extreme.The Virgin Suicides is a very well acted film and Coppola does get a really good cast. The actors were natural and the film did feel like it was set in a real American suburb with all the darkness under the surface, what teenagers get up to and the talking behind someone's back when something tragic happens. Turner played the true villain of the piece as the strict, controlling woman who does not allow her daughters to have any freedoms. Wood is a more sympathetic character if the clichéd man who keeps his feelings to himself. Dunst too was very strong as a teen with obvious problems as she slow enters in promiscuity at her young age.The Virgin Suicides is a very compelling drama and a great debut by Coppola.

Only a few Saint items elude me. The very hard to find Simon Dutton Saint adventures from the late 80's, the Andrew Clarke one off TV Movie from 1987, the old radio shows from he 40's and 50's and the forgettable French movies of the 60's.Because of this, I was very wary about the Val Kilmer movie featuring the halo'd character of Simon Templar despite having Saint legend Robert S. Baker as executive producer. My fears were not without foundation.The character of Simon Templar as originally written by creator Leslie Charteris is an English Gentleman adventurer thief, he is known by reputation as a criminal with morals. He despises injustice, never preys on the innocent and only steals from people he refers to as the ungodly who have made their ill gotten gains by riding rough shod over anyone and everything. In this movie we have an American Templar (1st mistake), who commits high tech robberies for extremely large sums on behalf of people who are morally bankrupt (2nd mistake). In fact Kilmer's portrayal of Simon Templar is as far removed from Charteris's creation and the character portrayed so well by Moore, Ogilvy and Sanders you cannot even recognise him as being the same person.Having said that it was SO easy to forget that this was even a Saint movie. As far as I'm concerned it was just a wonderful exciting movie about an American cyber criminal on the run from the Russian Mafia who falls in love with an American physicist. The action is gripping the plot engaging and the acting superb, apart from a few VERY sickly scenes between Kilmer and Shue. I'm all for romance between characters but......I did enjoy it but apart from the title it is in no way, shape or form, a Saint Movie. That was the producers 3rd and biggest mistake. By calling it a Saint movie, they were already on the back foot as expectations were no doubt going to be high especially from die hard Saint fans like myself. Making the Saint an American is a BIG no no. having the Saint happily work for criminals is another.If they had removed all reference to The Saint character from the story, I could be easily reviewing one of the best movies of the '90's. Kilmer's Character was more akin to Ethan Hunt than anything you would ever find in a Charteris book. However, Elizabeth Shue is GORGEOUS and I really did enjoy this movie very much for what it was. If you can forget it's a supposed to be a Saint movie then I'm sure you will too.Enjoy!!!

Kilmer's Character was more akin to Ethan Hunt than anything you would ever find in a Charteris book. However, Elizabeth Shue is GORGEOUS and I really did enjoy this movie very much for what it was.

I have read all the Saint books, I own and have seen all the old RKO Saint movies from the 30's, 40's and 50's with Louis Hayward, George Sanders and Hugh Sinclair and own all the TV episodes from the 60's & 70's with Roger Moore & Ian Ogilvy. Only a few Saint items elude me. The very hard to find Simon Dutton Saint adventures from the late 80's, the Andrew Clarke one off TV Movie from 1987, the old radio shows from he 40's and 50's and the forgettable French movies of the 60's.Because of this, I was very wary about the Val Kilmer movie featuring the halo'd character of Simon Templar despite having Saint legend Robert S. Baker as executive producer. My fears were not without foundation.The character of Simon Templar as originally written by creator Leslie Charteris is an English Gentleman adventurer thief, he is known by reputation as a criminal with morals. He despises injustice, never preys on the innocent and only steals from people he refers to as the ungodly who have made their ill gotten gains by riding rough shod over anyone and everything. In this movie we have an American Templar (1st mistake), who commits high tech robberies for extremely large sums on behalf of people who are morally bankrupt (2nd mistake). In fact Kilmer's portrayal of Simon Templar is as far removed from Charteris's creation and the character portrayed so well by Moore, Ogilvy and Sanders you cannot even recognise him as being the same person.Having said that it was SO easy to forget that this was even a Saint movie. As far as I'm concerned it was just a wonderful exciting movie about an American cyber criminal on the run from the Russian Mafia who falls in love with an American physicist. The action is gripping the plot engaging and the acting superb, apart from a few VERY sickly scenes between Kilmer and Shue. I'm all for romance between characters but......I did enjoy it but apart from the title it is in no way, shape or form, a Saint Movie. That was the producers 3rd and biggest mistake. By calling it a Saint movie, they were already on the back foot as expectations were no doubt going to be high especially from die hard Saint fans like myself. Making the Saint an American is a BIG no no. having the Saint happily work for criminals is another.If they had removed all reference to The Saint character from the story, I could be easily reviewing one of the best movies of the '90's.

It's a shame in his twilight years he has to constantly try and win an Oscar by making these dramas he does these days. I wish he'd go back to these old style ones that were so successful...but not necessarily...believable.It's pretty obvious by making this film he was cashing in on the Dirty Harry craze. A similar character with similar flaws and the same job. For some reason he just makes these types of films...fun.Right now I wanna get into the credibility gap in this film and it's premise. It's a laugh and big one. Can you imagine the Police Chief of a big city having the ability to just get anyone to shoot anyone he wants on his word? I mean we all know the premise of this film is for Eastwood's character to get his prisoner back to Arizona to testify but the Chief is obviously the one causing all the havoc...and the havoc is beyond an insane level. I mean he gets the Las Vegas mob to just shoot up everything and the Las Vegas Police to shoot up an entire house. On what grounds does any Police Department have the right to shoot up a house to bits? What about evidence? It's ridiculous.What's also funny is the helicopter-motorcycle chase seen. Don't you think that while they were on the main highway there would be at least a little traffic? And someone would have called the police mentioning that there's a guy in a helicopter shooting at people? How crazy is that.The final funny is the last sequence when he drives the bus into the city. Take a look at the cops and the positioning of them when they envelop the entire bus with bullets. They're right across from each other. Don't you think that would be a bit of a risk accidentally maybe...I dunno...shooting each other? Just a ridiculous idea. The great part is how the ole Police Chief again can get an almost entire Police Department to stand on a designated road way...in the middle of the city....and just let his Officers fire at will. What about property damage and the mass amount of windows being broken when he bullets fly? NO way on this planet would this fly in any city or town but as it is...this is still a really fun film from the 70's. When he and Sandra Locke teamed up they were electricity on screen. They complemented each other very well. It's a shame he doesn't do these films anymore...he could sure pack em in again if he did...guaranteed.

It is a charming love story, made especially touching by the beautiful performance of Audrey Hepburn. A fine actress throughout her career, Hepburn's golden age was clearly the 1950s when her youthful innocence and eager, expectant face made the vulnerability of her characters seem entirely believable and very sympathetic. Having the aging Maurice Chevalier as her father in Love in the Afternoon was an inspired bit of casting, and the two of them seemed to fit perfectly as father and daughter.But, of the major actors of the late fifties, Gary Cooper was probably the worst possible choice to play the young Hepburn's first great love, Mr. Flannagan. It is not so much that Cooper was too old a man to be the love interest of Hepburn's character, Ariane, although Cooper certainly looked very old and tired in the movie. Because Ariane is shown to be both innocent and impressionable, one could imagine her falling in love with an older and more sophisticated gentleman. In the movie Funny Face, Hepburn plays a character like Ariane who falls in love with the equally aged Fred Astaire, and that relationship seems quite believable.The problem with casting Cooper in Love in the Afternoon is that Mr. Flannagan is supposed to be a rather heartless, love-'em-and-leave-'em kind of guy, while Cooper's entire career in later life was devoted to playing honest, honorable, loyal men of strong and unshakable convictions. Perhaps the definitive Cooper role in the 1950s was the sheriff in High Noon. To have him play an aging, indifferent roué was an almost absurd bit of miscasting which, for me, did not seem believable for a minute.Love in the Afternoon is a beautiful love story &#x96; often touching and, thanks to the gypsies, sometimes very funny. What a shame that Cary Grant, Tyrone Power, and Fred Astaire himself were not available to play the movie's leading man.

It is a charming love story, made especially touching by the beautiful performance of Audrey Hepburn. A fine actress throughout her career, Hepburn's golden age was clearly the 1950s when her youthful innocence and eager, expectant face made the vulnerability of her characters seem entirely believable and very sympathetic. Having the aging Maurice Chevalier as her father in Love in the Afternoon was an inspired bit of casting, and the two of them seemed to fit perfectly as father and daughter.But, of the major actors of the late fifties, Gary Cooper was probably the worst possible choice to play the young Hepburn's first great love, Mr. Flannagan. It is not so much that Cooper was too old a man to be the love interest of Hepburn's character, Ariane, although Cooper certainly looked very old and tired in the movie. Because Ariane is shown to be both innocent and impressionable, one could imagine her falling in love with an older and more sophisticated gentleman. In the movie Funny Face, Hepburn plays a character like Ariane who falls in love with the equally aged Fred Astaire, and that relationship seems quite believable.The problem with casting Cooper in Love in the Afternoon is that Mr. Flannagan is supposed to be a rather heartless, love-'em-and-leave-'em kind of guy, while Cooper's entire career in later life was devoted to playing honest, honorable, loyal men of strong and unshakable convictions.

At that, Shall We Dance is a charming movie with tons of heart. Written and directed by Masayuki Suo, Shall We Dance has something Strictly Ballroom lacks depth and feeling. I'll compare Baz Luhrman with Oscar Wilde all flash and showy surface, with nothing underneath. Masayuki Suo has created a film with characters who move us. Koji Yakusho, Naoto Takenaka, Naoto Takenaka, and the other actors are excellent in their roles.The gist of the plot is that Mr. Sugiyama (Yakusho) is an overworked salaryman who spies a lovely younger woman in the window of a dance studio on his way home from work on the train. He has a wife, a daughter, and a mortgage, and no dreams. He takes up ballroom dancing to meet the younger woman, whose father owns the studio and who gives lessons. Dancing, of course, becomes a metaphor, and his fellow students grow from awkward, nameless bumblers to awkward, feeling humans as he (and we) learn to know them. The changes in the minor characters are more dramatic than the subtle growth of Mr. Sugiyama.In Shall We Dance, learning dance means proceeding from our awkward, graceless first steps to feeling the music and trusting your partner. Feeling emotion and trusting your partner and yourself go hand in hand with learning the dance. The process gets a little heavy-handed as characters spell it out for us, but it didn't detract from the emotional investment we make in watching the characters grow.The movie is often funny without being a comedy, and it's not a romance with budding young love -- Mr. Sugiyama is in his forties, and his dream girl has no romantic interest in him. But they develop a relationship on another, still meaningful level.Shall We Dance is also the title of a 1937 Astaire-Rogers film, and the Japanese version was remade under the same title in 2004, starring Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez. I have not seen either of these two movies.

He has always favored the route of bloated and stupid rather than coherent and intelligent, and he is anything but subtle in his first feature attempt as a director. Consistent readers of my work know I have an incredible disdain for the director\/writer himself, but I in no way believe he is a bad, horrible person. I'm just saying he writes, more often than not, bad, horrible films. I have no doubt in my mind that he is capable of writing and directing a good film, but he gets too involved with things that should be the secondary elements in a film. He brings background elements firmly into the foreground, and that poses a big problem.The story centers around Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Smith), two detectives for the Miami-Dade Police Department, who are called in to hunt down a $100 million worth of heroin that was intricately stolen from a secure vault. One of the petty criminals is Fouchet (Karyo), who early in the film shoots one of two escorts in his mansion. The other one named Julie (Leoni) will only speak to Lowrey on the count of her friends' relationship with the man.When Julie calls in about the murder, Lowrey is away, and the Captain forces Burnett to pose as Lowrey so as not to lose a valuable witness. He accepts, and off on a tangent we go through what is soon to be the long, eventful odyssey of mistaken identity. While Burnett puts Julie under protective custody, both the men work in seclusion to try and capture the drug lords and get their stash back.While not wonderfully executed, I can at least say that Bad Boys is fun and provides lightweight entertainment for those seeking it. It isn't the finest example of goofy, popcorn entertainment that I have encountered, but I can recognize the film has an audience that will be satisfied with the turnout, much like those horrifically awful Transformers films Bay so contently puts out. Just because I can respect that there is a fanbase for his material, doesn't mean I am forced to sit back and like it, and that's why I choose to voice my opinion on a lot of his films.Lawrence and Smith do a great job working together, both having expressive personalities and cheery, electric chemistry that provides kinetic energy to the screenplay. Although it appears as if their roles were switched. I have a hard time believing that Lawrence's Burnett is the mostly straight-laced cop with a family, and Smith's Lowrey is the fearless player with an act for taking advantage of women by having a different one every night. During the course of the film, I couldn't help but feel it should be the other way around. If that's a bit too vague to try and grasp, let me try and put it this way; has Will Smith ever been given a lesser role in any of his recent filmography? I too discovered that the original title for Bad Boys was going to be Bulletproof Hearts with SNL buds Dana Carvey and Jon Lovitz taking the roles of Lawrence and Smith. While I would've adored a buddy-cop comedy with Carvey and Lovitz as the leads, I couldn't quite grasp the idea of two cleaned-up guys like them playing dirty cops. For better or for worse, the roles were given to the right people.While the film provides light escapism, Bad Boys, however, makes one near-crucial mistake; it is too heavy-handed and over-produced to classify as campiness, which is what it is seemingly trying to achieve. It's a tad too long, shot like a music video (what else do you expect from Bay, who started out in that field?), and is viable because of its leads who have a charming chemistry and their commitment to a project so quirky and arbitrary. But, really, when you're working on a glossy piece of Hollywood, brought to you by someone whose talent is in the visual effects field and not much else, and are sometimes trudging through muddy clichés, whatcha gonna do?

For the majority of the film, I was bored, confused and occasionally repulsed. My repulsion is quite explainable, due to the amount of nuditiy in this film. While I don't find the female body repulsive, I do find needless scenes of female nudity being shoved in my face repulsive, particularly when they involve the breasts of a 14 year- old girl. My boredom and confusion however, stem from the fact that virtually every scene in this film is either too long or goes nowhere, often just seeming like filler. There are also scenes which make no sense whatsoever, such as when Anaïs suddenly appears naked on the beach, without any rhyme or reason. Then, suddenly, at the end, we are hit by an unfeasibly dark 'twist'. I put 'twist' in inverted commas because the mood of the film towards the end makes it blatantly obvious that there will be one. The only thing we aren't told is what that twist is. The twist itself is needlessly violent, and the reactions of the characters are somewhat confusing.This film shall be condemned to the vast scrapheap of movies I have seen, simply because it goes nowhere and makes little to no sense.

To me, as a youngster, this was like showing a light bulb to a moth. By the time 'Surviving the Game' was released, I was already a seasoned Ice-T and Bodycount fan and so would happily devour any of the nonsensical films which he would associate himself with (a trait which still exists to a certain degree, albeit somewhat diminished at this stage &#x96; thanks a lot 'Leprechaun In Da Hood'). Those yellow stickers never failed me; they drew me to movies such as the Tom Savini remake of Night of the Living Dead (1990), Body Melt (1993) and Bad Taste (1987). The peculiar thing about 'Surviving the Game' was that it was only classified with a 15 certificate in the UK, but as I was growing up in Ireland and they had just introduced their own film classification system (one which still prohibits the release of many, many titles today*) one can only assume that they were being extra vigilant.Such vigilance, however, was not displayed by any staff members at any of my frequented VHS rental outlets and so I was pretty much free to choose whatever I wanted and on one fine day I took the afternoon off school and retreated to my abode to wallow in some Ice-T based goodness.I regret none of those actions and this all came flooding back when I re-watched STG last week. The first thing that struck me was the plethora of character actors on show, Charles S. Dutton, Ernest R. Dickerson, F. Murray Abraham, Gary Busey, Jack Mason, John C. 'Dr Cox' McGinley and Rutger Hauer all come out in force as a group of hunters in pursuit of the deadliest game of all&#x85;man.The man in question is Jack Mason (Ice-T) a man battling his demons to the extent that he has lost everything, his wife, his child, his home. Now living rough on the streets of Seattle, he even loses his best friend when his dog is run over by a careless taxi driver in the first few minutes of the movie. The altercation with the driver brings Mason to the attention of Walter Cole (Dutton), a man posing as a charity worker, but who is in reality a recruitment officer for Thomas Burns (Hauer), an entrepreneur who facilitates the immoral bloodlusts of the rich and ethically vacuous Mason is brought to Burns' offices whereupon he is offered a job (with very little details provided), he reluctantly accepts and before he knows it, he's held up in a remote cabin in the wilderness with half a dozen of the most peculiar characters you're likely to see share a dinner together. It doesn't take long before their motives are made clear and Mason is cast out on his own, given a small head start before being tracked by the hunters.Guess what? The hunters soon become the hunted and the tables get well and truly turned. OK, so it sounds dreadful and in many ways, it is. Yet, it is so enjoyably dreadful that you soon find yourself letting go and immersing yourself in Mason's plight. There is an intensity and a unique self-awareness which makes this stand out from similar movies and eventually, this makes this a remarkably endearing viewing experience.It's violent without being excessively so, it has just the right amount of humour to maintain a suspension of disbelief and by the time comeuppance is delivered, you'll be cheering along. It was refreshing to see a strong African-American lead actor at the time and whist one wouldn't go as far as to call it ground-breaking in any sense of the word, that fact is certainly notable. Ice-T is quite far removed from his hip-hop persona and suits the crusty, dreadlocked role very well. Hauer and Busey are typically and wonderfully bonkers and the support of Abraham and McGinley are both worthy additions.It was a pleasure to be reminded of a time when action movies could be so enjoyable and when character actors would partake in the movie without dominating it. Admittedly, the rush that I got for simply acquiring it wasn't there this time, but I think that was due to the lack of the yellow sticker.Read more reviews at zombiehamster.com ","genre":null},{"date":"6 May 2012","score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" In one of our local video store chains, if a movie was considered morally objectionable it was emblazoned with a huge yellow sticker which proclaimed that it was 'Strictly over 18's'.
