He asks, `how does the audience know it is a movie?'-- A common thread is the notion of an x-ray, a film image that reveals the inner truth.-- The final framing is via a video.-- The fantasy in the film is set up as `Il Postino,' which slowly blends from the office screen into the action of the film.The effort at self-reference was rather over the top.

Her approach to acting is different than what one expects. She challenges the audience to break through her skin. It is opposite from the Emily Watson (Nic Cage) method where she splays her guts so that you can admire her commitment. Here, she cajoles you into drilling into a shared space that is ever so more intimate because you have made the commitment to film sex, rather like Martin's hapless character.
