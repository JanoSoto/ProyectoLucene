(i.e. you only want car chases, explosions, bouncing boobies and bathroom humor.) You will be very disappointed.I adored this movie and will purchase it as soon as I can get my hands on a copy. Why do I adore it? A few reasons.First, it is not your run-of-the-mill story. The time travel concept is handled in a very interesting way. The back story, the photograph, the father's phone number -- all keep you wondering as they do Ruby (Tomei's character). Too, I appreciated the way the viewer is never quite sure (until the end -- and I won't give it away) if Sam (D'Onofrio's character) is really telling the truth or really is mentally\/physically ill. I had a roommate for seven years who was bi-polar and borderline psychotic. It was scary how true this movie was in terms of what happens to the people who are dealing with (at least supposedly) mentally ill individuals.  The writing and Tomei's acting portrayed the enabling, co-dependant thing perfectly and how these types of relationship can spiral into dangerous places.Secondly, I liked the fact that the whole movie (except for a few brief shots at the beach and the ending) was filmed with a hand held camera. It gave it an almost documentary-like feel. I think the intimacy of the hand held kept the viewer's focus on the characters, rather like sitting in the room and looking back and forth between them. It also underscored their emotions, thereby grounding us in their reality. It just sucks you in. Because of this I never got a sense that this movie was trying to be a SciFi flick, and I don't think it was intended to be. The jerkiness of the hand held also was a reminder, subtle or not, of the shakey ground these characters were treading both separately and together.Third and last. D'Onofrio's performance. Outstanding. Man, he continually blows me away! His Sam had to be completely gentle and innocent on one hand, but very threatening and creepy on the other. Sam was so engaging and sweet at first but towards the middle of the film, while retaining those qualities, I was really beginning to wonder if he was a physical threat to Ruby. A fine edge to walk as an actor. And all the future and time theory babble was handled with apparent ease. I believed him. D'Onofrio has the ability to just melt into a character's skin, to completely transform himself. He gives it all.(On that note, there have been many in these reviews who say he usually plays evil characters and are surprised by this performance. He has done a few bad guys, but it is his other roles I love best. If you enjoy his work PLEASE check out - if you have not done so already - The Whole Wide World, Household Saints, Steal This Movie, and Good Luck. All good movies made GREAT by his performances. In my opinion he's one of the best out there and very under-rated.)The only thing I didn't like in the film was the score. It just didn't work for me.I felt it was intrusive and much too jarring. It seems like a misguided afterthought. For me, if I notice the score over the performances or it interrupts my ability to follow the story, it isn't doing it's job well.

What I want to talk about specifically, though, is the second half of the movie &#150; that is, everything past the point where Elaine Robinson finds out Benjamin and her mother have been having an affair. The film builds to a kind of climactic moment with that revelation, almost a mini-ending (complete with a long shot and a fade to black). Indeed, for many people, the film actually *does* end right about there it has long been a foregone conclusion in critical circles that the film never completely finds its way back on track from this point on. That is, once the focus shifts from the relationship of Ben and Mrs. Robinson to that of Ben's pursuit of Elaine, The Graduate simply runs out of gas.It's not my intention to argue too strenuously against this consensus I don't believe there can be any doubt that the first half of the movie is much sharper, funnier, more intense, and just all-around more involving than the second half. (Though I do believe that by the first part being *so* strong, and involving us so well, it does tend to make the weaknesses of the second part less jarring than they should be we already know and care about these characters &#150; Benjamin, anyway &#150; and want to follow them anywhere, no matter how sketchy and unfocused their stories begin to seem.)No, the point I want to make here is that, though The Graduate becomes a different *kind* of film in the second half (a romance, versus the sex farce\/comedy of manners that was the first half), it never ceases being jaundice-eyed and satirical about its characters. I say this because it is an easy enough assumption to make that the film makers expect us to take Benjamin's love for and quest of Elaine at face value to believe that they were `meant for' each other, and that their ultimate triumph is a resolution to be sincerely wished for. In reality, it is nothing of the sort. Ben and Elaine barely know each other &#150; at least not in any meaningful way &#150; when he begins his intense courtship of her (`stalking' might be the better term). There's something undeniably creepy and unsettling about Benjamin's fixation on Elaine it's as if he's on a quest to woo and win her, but he's doing it primarily for the sake of being on a quest (and perhaps as a way of jump-starting himself out of the rut that his relationship with Mrs. Robinson has become). There's nothing specific about Elaine that is spelled out for the audience as to why she might appeal to Ben so much &#150; save for the simple fact that she's NOT Mrs. Robinson. This lack has often been attributed to poor screenwriting and a flawed conception and, while that's an understandable conclusion to draw given the second half's other failings, I don't believe this is actually the case. Whatever you may think of it as a thematic strand, I believe this sense of blankness in the relationship between Ben and Elaine was deliberate on the part of the filmmakers - ie. they knew what they were doing, and what point they were trying to make. And that point relates directly to the fallacy of romantic love. We see many scenes of Ben viewing Elaine longingly from afar (to the omnipresent strains of Simon and Garfunkel), the camera's soft-focus making it all seem like something out of a fable, or (more likely) a Harlequin romance. But, as an audience, we are so used to (just as much today as back in 1967) accepting these kinds of shots and poses as a shorthand for deep love, and a feeling that the two characters in question were `meant' to be together, that we are easily fooled into thinking that that is just what the film makers have in mind for these two. In reality, it's an insightful (visual) comment upon just how such `shorthand' &#150; in not only film, but any of the arts (literature, song, painting, etc.) &#150; screws up young people such as Ben and Elaine, giving them the illusion of love and passion being there when they aren't.Which explains the film's ending &#150; that is, its very last shot. It should be joyous and celebratory, as Ben has succeeded in his goal &#150; snatching his beloved away from the altar and claiming her for himself (and she going along willingly, even giddily). But after the initial enthusiasm wears off, the smiles on the two of them dissipate and our final image of them is one of sheer dejection and confusion. And it must be so, because they have been duped by years of pop culture hogwash into believing that this is what true love is; the realization hits them hard that they don't have the slightest idea what they're doing together. And so Ben's dilemma of what to do with his `future' continues he has wound up in exactly the same place he was at the beginning of the movie &#150; only now with an equally confused human being as an appendage.As I say, all this may not make you *like* the second part of the movie any better than you do (I can appreciate it, but on a different, somewhat lesser, level than the first part). But I think it's at least important to be clear what the film makers were after, and to judge it according to how well it hits *that* mark, rather than the one we may have been *fooled* into thinking they were going for.

I think that although it was popular in its time, it is now very underrated. For me, it is one of the definitive romances, and any film that is definitive of its genre is clearly worth seeing. It is a beautiful, beautiful film. Everything in it is beautiful, which is one of the reasons it's such a pleasure to watch. The scenery and the sets and the soundtrack, even the actors are all ridiculously aesthetically pleasing. The film covers many important themes; colonialism, possession, the nature of society at that time, human resilience and endurance, and all of these themes are beautifully woven together, to create a colourful and very intriguing story. The soundtrack is gorgeous, and the haunting theme will stay with you for days; you will want to remember it.The best scene is where Robert Redford takes Meryl Streep flying, and the theme in the soundtrack bursts out in all its glory just as the characters are feeling total and complete happiness.The photography in that scene is stunning;you have to see it to know what I mean. The love story element has been criticised for not being passionate enough. What you get instead is an exploration of the problems that can occur when one person thinks the other does not really belong to them, which is much more interesting if you ask me. This is not the most passionate of love stories, but this by no means detracts from its worth within the genre. Redford is very attractive but makes his character out to be quite dull, although he effectively communicates Finch Hatton's longing for independence and solitude, and the way his character changes.At the end he says to KarenYou've ruined it for me, you know, being alone. Streep is, as always, amazing, and her performance is nicely understated. I thought her accent was very good, too. The supporting cast aren't amazing, but certainly adequate. Bror is good though. This may not be on most people's Top 10 Films lists, but it should be. See it if you want to feel joyful and sad simultaneously.

Back then I didn't realize that IMDB existed. of course if I had, my review of the movie would have differed a little bit from what is to follow. In retrospect, I went into this flick with entirely the wrong expectations and the wrong state of mind. By the time, I got around to seeing Arlington Road, it had already been out for three years. I was really excited to see it expecting it be more of an action flick with little to engage the mind. I was very wrong, as it turned out to be a very far cry from most action movies- the rather lurid opening scene should have clued me in to that fact right away. This movie is more of a suspense-drama and by the time you reach the movie's end- at least if our are like me- you'll probably want to seek out a mindless action flick in order to blot this one out of your mind.   The plot of this story revolves around a rather paranoid professor named Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges in a role that shoulda gotten him at least an Oscar nomination if not a win) who teaches a course in terrorism and FBI tactics. He especially has an emotional attachment to the subject as his wife, an FBI agent, was killed during a bust a couple of years earlier. Faraday lives with his girlfriend and his son from the previous marriage in a suburb of Washington, D.C. where he at least thinks he lives a quiet, peaceful existence. One day he is driving home from work and he see this kid walking around with a very bloody arm (Mason Gamble, who has matured a bit since Dennis the Menace). He takes him to the hospital and soon finds out that the kid is the son of the Langs (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack), the family that just moved in next door.  The two families soon start to intermingle and get to know each other. But after some time, Faraday begins to suspect that the Langs may in fact be terrorists. He later finds out that his suspicions are very well justified.    One thing about Arlington Road that helped it to keep its sense of credibility was the acting. All of the performances were top-notch. Bridges was especially superb and like I mentioned earlier, I hate the fact the Academy completely overlooked his performance. I mean, he stepped into Faraday's shoes and completely became him. The way he showed Faraday's paranoia and fear was done to perfection. Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack were pretty good in their roles as well, but it was Bridges who really stole the show. I grew so attached to his character that it made the ending that much more disturbing and heartbreaking. At the same time though, I can't help but think that he almost played into hands of the terrorists. I mean, it seems as though he almost played so cheaply in to their hands. Okay, yeah, so he had his suspicions. Understandable given the circumstances and what he knew about terrorism. By why did he have to wear his suspicions so visibly on his sleeves? It grew apparent that the Langs knew that he was on to them. That, in my mind, was what really sealed his fate. I still hated watching it though.   To add to this, what made it even more disturbing and realistic was that it so closely mirrored events that happened not to far before the movie was released (ie- the 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing, which was even referenced in the movie a few times)and it was also a hint of equally tragic and devastating events to come (ie- September 11, 2001). This movie was, and still is, a really sad reflection of what has transpired in recent times.  In conclusion, would I personally recommend that you go out and rent it? That all depends. If you're looking for some mindless, entertaining action flick where the main character shots big guns, gets to play with cool gadgets, beat the bad guys and save the day, it would be in our best interests not to venture anywhere near this Road. I would suggest that you check out the Die Hard series or check out Reindeer Games (the latter of which was also written by Ehren Krueger and similarly reflects his penchant for plot twists and suspense, without disturbing as was the case with Arlington Road).

Having reacquainted myself with it recently (and repeatedly) after having not seen it in almost two years, I myself am beginning to realize that. Not only is it thoroughly funny, it is entertaining and fast paced. David Spade plays Joe Dirt, a kind, well meaning radio-station janitor with an unusual hairdo (mullet!) and extremely bad-luck. He shares his life-story with the listeners of the radio station, which mainly focuses around his never-ending search for his parents (who ditched him on a family trip to the Grand Canyon) and his unrecognized love for hometown hottie Brandy. Joe meets many unusual people along the way, has many misadventures, and as if you couldn't guess, sets himself up for many disgusting and painful situations. The humor is pretty low-brow, but who cares? The movie is funny and that's the bottom line. What I like about this movie is that I can just turn it on and let go. The movie is so well-made for a simple comedy. Spade wrote the script himself, and you can tell he took his time. Every event in the movie happens for a reason and alludes to something that will occur later down the road. Also, Joe Dirt is Spade's first likeable character. You actually feel for this doofus. Even though he looks like white-trash, he is still a good person. Which of course, leads to this movie's moral Good things come to good people. Or as Joe would say Life's a garden, dig it! or You can't have 'no' in your heart! Christopher Walken has a hilarious bit as Dirt's co-janitor at an elementary school that has been placed in the witness protection program and Kid Rock plays Joe's bully perfectly (I love the part where he reads the note just like those guys in high school who couldn't read past 2nd grade reading level). But Spade is the real star here. Too bad this character\/movie never took off. I seriously love this movie. It is consistently hilarious, has dozens of quoteable lines (stuff that you say to people in your daily routine) and has an overall feel good vibe to it. I don't know how anyone can trash this movie.

Having reacquainted myself with it recently (and repeatedly) after having not seen it in almost two years, I myself am beginning to realize that. Not only is it thoroughly funny, it is entertaining and fast paced. David Spade plays Joe Dirt, a kind, well meaning radio-station janitor with an unusual hairdo (mullet!) and extremely bad-luck. He shares his life-story with the listeners of the radio station, which mainly focuses around his never-ending search for his parents (who ditched him on a family trip to the Grand Canyon) and his unrecognized love for hometown hottie Brandy. Joe meets many unusual people along the way, has many misadventures, and as if you couldn't guess, sets himself up for many disgusting and painful situations. The humor is pretty low-brow, but who cares? The movie is funny and that's the bottom line. What I like about this movie is that I can just turn it on and let go. The movie is so well-made for a simple comedy. Spade wrote the script himself, and you can tell he took his time. Every event in the movie happens for a reason and alludes to something that will occur later down the road. Also, Joe Dirt is Spade's first likeable character. You actually feel for this doofus. Even though he looks like white-trash, he is still a good person. Which of course, leads to this movie's moral Good things come to good people. Or as Joe would say Life's a garden, dig it! or You can't have 'no' in your heart! Christopher Walken has a hilarious bit as Dirt's co-janitor at an elementary school that has been placed in the witness protection program and Kid Rock plays Joe's bully perfectly (I love the part where he reads the note just like those guys in high school who couldn't read past 2nd grade reading level). But Spade is the real star here. Too bad this character\/movie never took off. I seriously love this movie. It is consistently hilarious, has dozens of quoteable lines (stuff that you say to people in your daily routine) and has an overall feel good vibe to it. I don't know how anyone can trash this movie.

'New Nightmare' takes place as though all previous NOES films are works of fiction, with the original stars of the films - Heather Langenkamp, John Saxon and Robert Englund, playing themselves on the Hollywood film sets, themselves menaced by Freddy as they were in the films they acted in. Although an intriuging and intellegent concept, which would influence the new wave of post-modern teen slashers such as 'Scream', 'New Nightmare' still fails to reach the level of primative terror induced by the original NOES. Perhaps the reason for this is that nothing really much happens in the film. Bogged down in its own sense of knowing and intellect, it forgets that its primary concern is to scare the audience. The film takes far too long to get going, making sure the audience had grasped the concept of Freddy entering the 'real world' from the world of films, with many tedious scenes simply depicting conversations with the cast members, taking place in offices. Such scenes are made worse by producers' or directors' inability to act. Heather Langenkamp also seems to have a slight problem - her constant frown and whispering voice soon begin to grate, as it is realised that her nor any other member of the cast appear even remotely scared. Many of the scares evolve around menacing phonecalls or simply a shot of Heather's son Dyllan pulling a face and attempting to growl in a Freddy-esque voice. Freddy himself takes too long to make an appearance, and when he finally does, his presence is more than underwhelming, despite the attempt to give him a new look. The earthquake scenes are repetitive and false looking and serve no real purpose or relevance to the narrative. The special effects are often dire - making the original NOES's far more basic (as well as inexpensive) effects seem far superior and effective. At times the sound effects seem to have been taken from a single sound effects CD - with the same sound being used in different situations. A petty argument, but noticeable nontheless. The set used for Freddy's lair at the end of the film is visually interesting and differs from the boiler room used in the other films, however it is underexplored and underused.However, a number of these arguments could be explained by the film's unique style. Although it is never overtly stated, the shaky camera work suggests a documentary feel to the film - an aspect which complements the 'real life' concept of the film. Also, by the end of the film (if you have been paying enough attention) the meaning of the story and Freddy's existense will be explained in a rewarding and intelligent way. However, a clever concept does not excuse its lack of engagement with the audience. Craven made the same mistake with 'Scream' - concerning himself too much with the witticisms of the script instead of the ability to scare the audience. Here it is the same - too much time is spent indulging in his own desire to exorsise the conventions of the genre. It is this which contributes to the film's dragging pace and a sense of their being no real direction within the narrative.Despite these arguments, for die hard fans, 'New Nightmare' still proves entertaining and a satisfying conclusion to the series (although Freddy Vs Jason will be here shortly). The film is full of visual and quotable references to the previous films - perhaps the most effective is one of the final sequences when, dressed in Nancy's clothes and sporting her famous grey streak, Heather realises she must take on the role of Nancy to defeat Fred Kruegar.

It had already been out for three years and I had been meaning to see it for some time. When I finally got the chance, it turned out not to be what I expected. Being a fan of action flicks, I came into the movie expecting something along those line . This movie was a far cry from that expectation- the rather lurid opening scene should've clued me in to this right from the get-go. This movie is more of a supense\/drama than anything else and let me tell you, by the time you reach the end of the movie, you will want to go out and rent a nice feel-good action flick, just so that you can forget this movie's rather disturbing, tragic conclusion.The plot of Arlington Road revolves around the rather paraniod professor Michael Faraday (an extremely convincing Jeff Bridges) who teaches a course in terrorism and FBI tactics. He has a somewhat emotional attachment to this subject, as his wife, an FBI agent, was killed by terrorists during an operation a couple of years earlier. Faraday lives in a suburban Washington, D.C. nieghborhood with his girlfriend and his son from said previous marriage. One day, he is driving home from work and he sees this kid with his body all bloodied up from something and quickly rushes to his aid. Faraday soon finds out that this kid is the son of the new couple that just moved in next door (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack). The two families soon become well acquainted with each other and develop a decent relationship. But Faraday soon starts to suspect that behind the seemingly friendly facade of his new neighbors lies a major terrorist plot.  Soon, it is discovered that his suspicions were well founded.One really good thing about this movie was the acting. All of the performances were wll done, especially from Jeff Bridges. Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack were pretty strong in their supporting roles but it was definitely Bridges' performance carried the movie. His performance was Oscar-worthy and why the Academy failed to get that through its thick skull, is honestly beyond me. I mean, he played Michael Faraday with so much conviction that I honesly felt so much for him and what he had to go through. This by itself made the ending of the movie that much more heartbreaking. However, at the same time, you can't help but think that Faraday kinda brought it upon himself. I mean, yeah, so he had this suspicion. Understandable, given his knowledge of terrorism. But don't you think he coulda shown a little more subtlety about it? I mean, he went into the guy's house for cryin' out loud. That was a major faux pas on his part. It still hurt to see what happened to him though.Probably the most disturbing thing about this movie was the fact that it so closely mirrored events that happened only a few years before it was released (ie-the 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing, which was even referenced in the movie a few times) and was a hint of equally tragic events to follow even sooner afterwards (ie-September 11, 2001). This was, and still is, a movie of the times in which we live and that is very, very sad.In conclusion, should you go out and rent this movie? That all depends. If you're looking for an entertaining action\/thriller where the main character gets to play with cool weapons, blow stuff up, beat the bad guys and save the day, do not venture anywhere near this Road. I would recommend the likes of movies like the Die Hard series, or Reindeer Games (the latter of which was also written by Ehren Kruger and similarly reflects his penchant for suspense and plot twists without being so distrubring) However, if you're looking for an intense, though-provoking, searing drama with intelligent dialogue, a realistic (albeit unsettling) ending and top-notch performances to boot, Arlington Road is the place for you.

The other reviews here that I just read did a good job of covering most of the main points I would make about the film so I'll only mention two I didn't see in those reviews.1. The events in this film are not slathered over in a stirring soundtrack (the occasional Abba tune is almost tongue-in-cheek).  The significance of each event, both for the story and for the characters, is allowed to simply be whatever it might happen to be for the viewer; we're not hand-held to like or dislike or laugh or cry.  I really, really appreciated that.  Combined with the way almost every character had their good moments and bad moments, the effect for me was to make this fictional world very believable.  Even a few obviously over-the-top moments couldn't break the spell.2. The title led me to think of this as a light-hearted, feel-good movie.  It's not, really, though neither does it try to play up the emotionally vivid elements of the plot.  In retrospect, I suppose the title fits; the problem is, it's titled in a spirit unlike most movies are titled, which is why I was expecting something else.This is a really, really good movie.  Not quite perfect, but I give it 8\/10.  It would have been 9 with a better ending.  Some of the flaws it does have seem to me to be such that correcting them would alter the feel of the movie unacceptably, so, while I might agree, for instance, that the consequences of Muriel's lifestyle aren't entirely dealt with, I'm not sure I would want them to be entirely dealt with within this movie.

(mostly ups, I think)The story revolves around a Navy SEAL (I'm sure its been mentioned many times, but SEAL is SEa Air and Land)unit sent in to rescue the crew of a US helicopter taken hostage. However, while escaping, two SEALs come across a cache of Stinger missiles, but there's no time to demolish them. As well, the terrorist leader, disguised as a prisoner himself, is accidentally allowed to escape. The movie focuses in on the team's search for the weapons on their suspect, and it also gives audiences a glimpse at what SEALs do.Overall, I found this movie very entertaining (The opening hostage rescue scene being the highlight of the movie). I also enjoyed the fact that this movie showed all the different ways SEALs get to their target. (parachute, swimming, etc). There's some comic relief to it (its lame, but its pretty funny), and it delivers some great SEAL action throughout (especially the training and killhouse scene). The music is very catchy, too, giving an overall patriotic feel.However, this movie is not without its inaccuracies, which there are many of. First of all, each soldier has the same weapon, an MP5 Silenced, yet each soldier's gun makes a different sound.

But when watching this movie, take a chance and forget that this movie is based on the book.  A strange suggestion, but if you do it, it will be worthwhile.Though the story has many differences from the book\/musical\/other adaptions, it is still a very good story.  The costumes and sets were good.  And the performances were brilliant.  Liam Neeson may not have been the Valjean we're all used to, but he did a wonderful job and created a very complex character who I really think you can't help but feeling sorry for\/liking. I have never seen Geoffery Rush in anything else, and my first impression of him is that he is an AMAZING actor.  He was a very good choice for Javert. Uma Thurman was...gosh, she was so incredible.  Claire Danes did very well, and she made me like the character Cosette (I really didn't in the musical...when I saw it, I was rooting for Eponine), and even though the Marius wasn't really the one in the musical (um...a cross between Marius and Enjorlas?), I was really impressed with Hans Matheson's performance.It's a different take on Victor Hugo's novel, but it is still an awesome film.

Everything, from the spaceships to the flying cars to the city, is an example of eye-popping special effects. For that alone, I would recommend it. There are several other things going for it, too, though I can't forget the fact that the story is a mess and many individual scenes are annoying and headache-inducing. Hey, everything comes with a price, and these visuals are no different.In terms of plot, let's just say the film takes place a few hundred years in the future, and Bruce Willis is the hero who must save the Earth before a huge ball of evil will destroy it. To do so, Willis needs the help of the fifth element, turns out its Milla Jovovich. Impeding the good guys are a band of ugly aliens and an over-the-top Gary Oldman as a nasty businessman named Zorg.There are a lot of little things about The Fifth Element that bug me. First is Zorg's motivations. Apparently, he's been chosen by that big ball of evil to hinder Willis and Jovovich, and he cooperates seemingly because he believes in a big financial pay-off. Exactly what he can do with any riches after the Earth is destroyed raises more than a few questions. Basically, Oldman's just here to chew the scenery and give us a human villain, even though in the end, he isn't particularly menacing and never even comes face-to-face with Willis.Rather, the villains who participate in the physical action are a group of really ugly aliens (whose names I can't think of at the moment) that have the ability to shapeshift. These aliens look really silly, but I'll give director Luc Besson the benefit of the doubt and assume the effect was entirely intentional. Even then, they don't make for very imposing antagonists, they're almost as easy to kill as storm troopers, and they're only slightly more competent.But such flaws are made up for by not only the movie's great look, but its sense of fun. At its heart, The Fifth Element is not science fiction but a comical action\/adventure with mismatched heroes, a damsel in distress, and bad guys who threaten the world itself. Bruce Willis makes for a great deadpan hero, and as usual, excels during the action sequences. Jovovich isn't quite my idea of the perfect being, but she's acceptable in her role. Almost taking me out of the movie is an annoying Chris Tucker as an androgynous DJ. He's here as comic relief, and while he gets off a few good laughs, he's more of a detriment than anything else.Surprisingly enough, even though The Fifth Element moves at a fast pace, there are only a few all-out action scenes. Aside from a flying car chase (which Star Wars Episode II obviously took inspiration from) and a big climactic gun battle, there's not a whole lot of physical violence going on here, at least not when compared to some of the other sci-fi action films released around the same time (Star Trek First Contact, Alien Resurrection, Starship Troopers).Keeping the film consistently enjoyable is Besson's sense of humor. He knows well enough not to take such a story seriously, so don't be surprised by how much the movie acknowledges its own silliness. I've not seen a whole lot from Besson that I liked (I always found The Professional overrated and The Messenger a bloated, though not entirely unenjoyable, mess), but The Fifth Element comes the closest to a movie of his that I genuinely liked.

Yes, my Father wasn't so much John Steed, more Olly Reed, his worse moment being a live restaurant urination in front of 300 stunned diners at the Greenwich Steakhouse. Its hard to explain the disappointment I felt at that point but at least I thought after this it would be hard to feel too letdown again by anything.Not so.Flash forward to June 1999, New York City. Yours truly is treated to a revisionist revival of Star Wars in which any hope, new or otherwise, that the years may have paved the way for writer\/director Geroge Lucas to craft a mature, pared down, excitement laden prequel to films which many people know better than themselves, is dashed with horrific cruelty. Never go back, my old man had said and for once he'd been right.The Phantom Menace attempts to fill in the back story to the classic trilogy but arguably starts too early in the story. Forgetting completely that the young audience of the original are now slightly more demanding adults, Lucas aims low and hits every time, his target audience preschoolers and under 12's. Attempting to manufacture what happened accidentally via positive communal experience is a dangerous game to play and Lucas doesn't foul so much as get sent off mid-way through the match having butchered all the other players. Jake Lloyd is awful as the young Anakin and conspicuously gives no clues as to motives for future wrongdoing. This of course would make him less heroic to viewers of similar ages thus effecting those all important toy sales. Jar Jar Binks, with a personality as deep as the pixels that create him is an offensively unfunny racial stereotype - a ridiculous and cynical creation. Ewan McGregor as Kenobi manages to demystify the old Jedi Master completely by giving a performance so lifeless he could be a computer generated effect himself and Yoda is realised by sub-standard puppetry that gives him all the authority of an action figure. The simple good versus evil, old serial heroics of the original film are lost here as Lucas tries to tell a more complicated story but forgets to make it interesting.

Ultimately, like this review, its just f**king boring and thats the worst charge you could level at a series as iconic as this one. The 'Cus has dismissed any criticism of this the Phantom Menace by pointing out that it's merely the first act in a 6 act series. Fine, but surely they taught Lucas at film school that the first act is supposed to hook the audience. Whoever heard of a first act that DISSUADED an audience from watching the rest.
