Too bad it only lasts that long.A beautiful, peaceful morning in the Big Apple is suddenly disturbed by a bombing at a department store. Barely do the police have time to gain their bearings when a call comes in from a man called Simon (Jeremy Irons). He wants to play a game of Simon Says with our beloved hero John McClane. Non-compliance will result in a penalty--another bomb going off somewhere in the city.His first stop is Harlem, where must wear a sandwich sign bearing a racist slogan never seen in Harlem. When his life is saved by a man named Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson), Simon says that he too must run all over town solving his deadly puzzles.Die Hard With a Vengeance was promoted with the premise I just described, only it turns out to be the Hollywood equivalent of bait and switch. After a mere three puzzles, the focus shifts to a far inferior plot and deconstructs all the tension that has been built in the movie's first third.Following the explosion of one of his bombs in a Wall Street subway station, Simon threatens to destroy a school. The bomb will respond if the police use their radios, so the ever intelligent police chief floods all police traffic through 911, and sends out the entire police force to search schools for the bomb. In other words, there could be a full-blown gunfight and the cops would never know about it.While the police run around like chickens with their heads cut off, Simon, who has about a hundred men at his disposal, begins to rob several billion dollars from a federal bank. This is all detailed in an overlong and uninteresting section played to the tune of When Johnny Comes Marching Home.Unfortunately, the use of car sales tactics is not the film's worst problem; it is the characters, most specifically, the character of John McClane. In the first film, he worked for the New York Police Department and was trying to got transferred to the LAPD as soon as he could. In the second film, he was LAPD and any marital problems from the first film appeared to be water under the bridge. Now, he is a once again a New York cop, his wife lives on the opposite coast, and he is one step away from a life steeped in alcoholism. In other words, all the time we spent rooting for John and Holly to overcome their marital problems was wasted. I am of the opinion that if Hollywood studios cannot find a consistent, positive way to treat their characters from one film to the next, then they have no business making a sequel (see Speed 2).Samuel L. Jackson is probably one of the best actors in Hollywood right now, but the limitations of the material are evident. It is awfully difficult to care for Zeus because of his heavy racism (do not let his heroic actions in Harlem fool you, he had an ulterior motive). Likable or not, he easily outshines the rest of the cast, especially Willis, who benefits from several one-liners that are funny on paper, but delivered in a way that robs them of all comic appeal. One question If Zeus is such a smart mathematician, then why is his vocabulary so limited?Jeremy Irons is well below average as the villain. He starts out in convincing fashion when only his voice is present, though the dark tone he used to voice Scar in Lion King is curiously missing. Once we see his face, the character loses all impact. It is shame that Simon was not treated more like Kiefer Sutherland's baddie in Phone Booth, who, if you remember, was not seen until the end. Of course, this would have meant sticking to the main premise of the film, apparently a task too large for the makers.Speaking of the end, Die Hard With a Vengeance is devoid of excitement for the last half hour. I will not discuss the final scene except to say that it is not usually a good sign when a film forgets about seventy some characters it makes a point of showing on camera. Oh, and I still have not figured out how the trucks got past the border.Plot holes like this can be overcome with good acting but was there any to speak of? A tiny bit. Aside from Kevin Chamberlin's rarely seen bomb expert, the film's best acting comes from Alan Rickman, the bad guy from the FIRST Die Hard. He is briefly seen in a flashback.

A voice-over can maybe give us some of it -- that famous first paragraph -- but the problem is that there is such mellifluous gamy prose on every single page. (I think there are only about three sections in which Humbert doesn't undercut his expressions of love and guilt with irony.) How can we transpose HH's offhand rhetorical remarks like, Where is the rapist in therapist? Where is the jest in majesty? And that's not to mention all of the literary allusions or comic references to pop culture.The story itself is so simple that, if Lolita weren't twelve years old, it would be just another love story. And, I was, by the way, surprised when this film was released at the horror some people felt -- oh, my gosh, a movie about pedophilia. I mean -- in this day and age? Movies about thinly disguised pedophilia of course have been around for years -- Sundays and Cybele, Pretty Baby, among others. And the Shirley Temple movies may not have been all that innocent either, she prancing about in those tiny skirts reeking of popcorn and lollipops, wagging her tail, a forty-year-old midget for all we know. And if we think of Lolita as innocent and corrupted, we don't know as much about what's happening with kids that age as we might like to think. This is a story about pedophilia in the way that Faust is a story about Satanism. Jeremy Irons is superb here, as he is in almost everything he's done. One can't help comparing this version to Kubrick's earlier one, and this one isn't as good. Dominique Swain is no Lolita. She's an improvement over Sue Lyons, to be sure, but not actress enough to break a grown man's heart, or to project that peculiar combination of meanness, crudity, and ultimate loneliness that Lolita embodied. Melanie Griffith does what she can with the role of Charlotte Haze but I thought Shelley Winters brought a bit of additional, maybe unintended vulgarity to the part. Griffith is serene and self-confident, which is closer to the Charlotte of the novel, but for unashamed raw hunger nobody can beat Winters.The direction is competent, not much more than that. But this is a hollow movie. It fails to capture the outrageous humor of the novel (I was a pentapod monster....). The score is lugubrious. The photography gloomy where the novel is filled with summer warmth, aspens, butterflies and sunshine. In other words, the movie treats the novel as a masterpiece, deserving serious treatment, which is the kiss of death for Lolita. Like Strick's attempt to film Ulysses, all the humor is lost and what's left is a kind of humdrum story about people talking to one another without having that much to say. But if you are interested in unusual love stories I can recommend seeing this. See Kubrick's piece as well. They're rather different, because Kubrick, maybe realizing he could never capture the wisecracks in the novel, at least brought in Peter Sellers to provide laughs. But here, Quilty, Frank Langella, is little more than an ominous shadowy presence, whereas both in the novel and in Kubrick's film he was a terrible and hilarious tease.

This is a story about pedophilia in the way that Faust is a story about Satanism. Jeremy Irons is superb here, as he is in almost everything he's done. One can't help comparing this version to Kubrick's earlier one, and this one isn't as good. Dominique Swain is no Lolita. She's an improvement over Sue Lyons, to be sure, but not actress enough to break a grown man's heart, or to project that peculiar combination of meanness, crudity, and ultimate loneliness that Lolita embodied. Melanie Griffith does what she can with the role of Charlotte Haze but I thought Shelley Winters brought a bit of additional, maybe unintended vulgarity to the part. Griffith is serene and self-confident, which is closer to the Charlotte of the novel, but for unashamed raw hunger nobody can beat Winters.The direction is competent, not much more than that. But this is a hollow movie. It fails to capture the outrageous humor of the novel (I was a pentapod monster....). The score is lugubrious. The photography gloomy where the novel is filled with summer warmth, aspens, butterflies and sunshine. In other words, the movie treats the novel as a masterpiece, deserving serious treatment, which is the kiss of death for Lolita. Like Strick's attempt to film Ulysses, all the humor is lost and what's left is a kind of humdrum story about people talking to one another without having that much to say. But if you are interested in unusual love stories I can recommend seeing this. See Kubrick's piece as well. They're rather different, because Kubrick, maybe realizing he could never capture the wisecracks in the novel, at least brought in Peter Sellers to provide laughs. But here, Quilty, Frank Langella, is little more than an ominous shadowy presence, whereas both in the novel and in Kubrick's film he was a terrible and hilarious tease.

This makes perfect sense because no other Kurosawa\/Mifune corroboration has taken this all-out crack at comedy. It does not mean that sense of humour is lacking among Kurosawa's strength. Indeed, no master is truly great without a sense of humour. For example, both Hitchcock and Kurosawa like to inject a dose of their sense of humour, respectively, at the frightening and poignant junctures in their films. In Sanjuro, the amusing characteristics of the character portrayed by Mifune were not new. They were all there in Yojimbo before, but fully unleashed in Sanjuro, and some on the brink of being overused, such as the flexing of the neck and shoulder muscles, which looks like a shrug. \tIndeed Kurosawa did not lose a single opportunity of making Sanjuro so much fun to watch. The nine young samurai, courageous but impulsive and inexperienced, provide excellent material and the mood here is set from the very beginning, in the scene when they are trapped in their meeting place. After Mifune (I'm using the artist's name instead of the character's for simplicity) had driven away the enemies and calls them from the hiding place below, their heads pop up in threes, twos and singly, giving it almost an animation flavour. The rescued mother and daughter is of course a pair of darlings, particularly the mother, whose interaction with Mifune is a classic yin and yang confrontation, but depicted in a most amusing way. And then we have the captured samurai who keeps popping out from the closet in which he is confined, offering his unsolicited opinion, then suddenly remembering his station in the scheme of things, crawls back inside, demurely closing the sliding door behind him. These are but a few examples that give the film a festive mood.The DVD I watched has only Chinese subtitle. Although I can't really claim to judge the quality of the translation as I don't know Japanese, gut feel tells me that they are good compared to the garbage you often see on screens in Hong Kong these days. Still, I can't help but think that for Sanjuro, some of the fun may have been lost in the translation. Fortunately, body language and facial expression does a lot to make up for it.There is much more in Sanjuro than just first class comedy. Kurosawa is a great master of capturing motion on the screen (as Ozu is the great master in capturing stillness on the screen). The most outstanding scene in Sanjuro demonstrating this occurs quite early in the story. After Mifune voluntarily joins the nine, they formulate the first plan he would take three men with him to try to rescue the lord's wife and daughter while the rest would scout around for information. This is followed immediately by a series of rapidly cut shots each with a young samurai running swiftly in the street, at various directions. The whole series takes a few seconds but the momentum generated is immense.While the tone throughout the film is light, we should not lose sight of the undercurrent continually building up between the Kurosawa and Nakadai, culminating in one of the best duel scenes in the entire film industry, if not the best. When the lord's rescued wife first meets Mifune, she comments that he is too `bright', like an unsheathed sword. At the end, Mifune says that both he and Nakadai are unsheathed swords. From the very beginning, these two recognise each other as truly worth opponents and this is reaffirmed during their encounters throughout the film. In the end, Mifune is forced into the duel reluctantly. Even Nakadai himself does not seem to particularly want it. However, within his own universe of logic, because he has been made a fool by Mifune, the only way out for him is a duel. What we have then is a duel very similar to the fast-draw type of duels in westerns, but at close range. And that is what makes a world of difference. The two men stand facing each other, within striking distance, in absolute stillness, for what seems to be an eternity (I was tempted to re-watch the DVD to measure and report the actual time but such a piece of information would take something away the beauty of the film). The absolute intensity is followed by simply brutality as the swords are unsheathed in a flash (but not so fast as to impair our visual enjoyment of the beauty of the geometry of the draws) and the abrupt eruption of blood from Nakadai's chest signifying a punctured heart (the Chinese translation of the title is `Heart piercing sword'). While good direction in a western may match the intensity, I would personally prefer the visual beauty of the silent, deadly draw of the sword to the loud cracking of the gun.

The first time I saw Blue Velvet, I did not like it. I considered the film to be interesting at times but flat most of the time. However, I decided to give it another try. WOW. I was blown away by the film. It interested me but it also had a gripping energy that is rare in many films. It is a film of many strengths and theres no doubt in my mind that it is a masterpiece.Blue Velvet's acting is definitely a strength. I am not a fan of Kyle Machlachlan but he is undoubtedly perfect for this role. The same thing for Laura Dern and there is definitely chemistry between them. Isabella Rossellini is plagued as an actress, she is the daughter of Ingrid Bergman, one of the greatest actresses that ever lived. That is one hell of an act. Rossellini will definitely not live up to that. However, she must be given alot of credit for this role. She is perfect here, this is not an easy character to grasp but she does it. She took a chance with this role, not only appearing nude but I bet some actresses would be disgusted with this character. Not Rossellini who does it perfectly and though she wont live up to her mother, this role is no minor entry to her resume and her mother would be proud. As perfect as Machlachlan, Dern, and Rossellini are, Dennis Hopper is the standout. He portrays the character like it is, a ruthless villain. Like, with Rossellini's character this charcter may disgust some actors. Hopper plays the character like he is meant to be. In doing so, he creates one of the best villains ever on film. David Lynch's films have always been visually fascinating, Blue Velvet is no exception. The opening shots that represent the American Dream are beautiful. The film is loaded with dark atmosphere thats very appropriate for this film. Blue Velvet is called The Most Talked About Film Of The Decade, its decade was the 80s. Theres no wondering why, Blue Velvet was ahead of its time then and it has a very dramatic effect on the viewer. Some of the film's subject matter is not pretty nor is it meant to be. There are unattractive scenes in this film that are highly effective, but might disturb a viewer but then again thats the point.  Blue Velvet is not a perfect film, though it is close. The one part I find a little odd is Sandy (Laura Dern) talking about her dream. It makes a connection to one of the last images of the film but it comes off on the lines of preachy, well maybe not preachy but something like it. However, thats a minor complaint about a Masterpiece. Its not for everybody, but for people who understand this film you will be amazed.

All in all, it's an uneven comedy that's way too silly at times, but there are enough laughs for it to deserve a recommendation.  As I said before, much kudos to DeNiro for a priceless comic performance.

The entire middle section of the movie is annoying, especially cheap, dated jokes about the weird food people who are not like us eat, and the reliance on the Thuggee cult.  But the weaknesses extend beyond that, too.  Unlike in the first and third, Indy doesn't have a true quest that stems from his knowledge and love of archaeology.  He almost literally stumbles across a village who needs a sacred stone returned, and so he obligingly goes and gets it.  The action scenes are excellent, and the scope and scale of the movie are impressive, but overall it just doesn't work.
