[{"date":"19 December 2009","score":"","review":" Haha. Yeah, that's right, the summary is says it all. I was amazed when I came onto this page to see that its rating was so low. When I saw this movie a couple months ago I absolutely loved it. I thought it was incredible. To people that have made comments that Crudup's acting was poor or flat, I would say that nothing is farther from the truth. This movie made me believe in him as an actor. Perhaps it's just me, but the degree to which I identify with his character is almost scary. Especially given the context of the movie and his descent into madness.This movie was incredibly powerful and perfectly describes my own moral dilemmas when it comes to interacting with politics. Do you use the system in order to bring about change, or do you reject the system because it is rife with corruption and unable to be saved? Not only that, but it's treatments of grief and doubt, shame and responsibility, and the hopes and horrors of insanity are all extremely complex and interesting. The characters are deep and intriguing, the dialog is engaging, and the direction superb.A wonderful movie. ","genre":null},{"date":"19 December 2009","score":"","review":" Haha.
