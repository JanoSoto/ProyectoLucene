The other reason why Star Trek The Wrath Of Khan is so effective is the human drama aspect.Star Trek is most associated with the neat, clean, pristine look of space props, but this is where the characters got really down and dirty. With fleets of warships traveling the cosmos, one really has to wonder how long it is before humans start hunting each other down in such ships as part of a personal vendetta. This is the scenario that Star Trek II is based around. Khan, having been left on a planet during an episode of the original series, has found fate not quite smiling upon him. Given that it was Kirk who left him on the planet, he figures that it's Kirk's fault, and therefore Kirk must suffer. This creates enough dramatic moments between the main two actors that unlike a lot of Star Trek episodes, it keeps the viewer bolted to the screen, waiting to see what happens next.Star Trek II is also the first, and so far only, Star Trek that can be solidly labeled as aimed at adults. Characters do excruciating things to one another, characters die unpleasantly, and characters are forced to face up to some very unpleasant shortcomings. Granted, the heroes still live in a bit of a microverse where the ramifications of their actions never really seem to affect anyone else, but the ramifications within said microverse are so powerful that it makes up for this. Other science fiction films based around a ruthless antagonist trying to taunt the protagonist with something truly horrible have been made, Virtuosity being a recent example, but there is something about this one that just hits a nerve.If there is one criticism I have of the film, it is that sometimes the cost-cutting measures show up. Recycling the footage of the Klingon warships from the original film wasn't such a good idea, for example. Surely there must have been some unused shots that could have worked just as well?

In fact, I avoided the movie treatment of Interview With the Vampire for a number of years, first--because I was doubtful that it would translate well from page to screen, and second--because I thought that the cast they chose were absolutely wrong. After recently watching Interview for the first time, my suspicions were confirmed--it was simply an abomination. For some reason, I wasn't as concerned about Queen of the Damned being made into a movie, even though it happened to be my favorite book in the series. Knowing that it was going to suffer in translation made me less apprehensive about it, and I was able to enjoy it for what it is--a spirited vampire romp. Inaccurate, but quite enjoyable.Before I watched it, I had no idea that the filmmakers decided to combine The Vampire Lestat with Queen of the Damned, Therein lay its primary structural problem. Condensing hundreds of pages of a single book's text--action, dialogue, inner monologues and descriptive prose--into a 100 minute movie is limiting enough, but to attempt it with TWO books was a serious mistake. It made Akasha into a relatively minor character, with very little background, little humanity and unclear motivation. Aaliyah was physically very good in the role (she could move very well, and her face is quite expressive), even if her acting performance was rather broad. But the good news is that--as Lestat--Stuart Townsend is light years better than Tom Cruise (but then, so would be any one of 100 other actors). Not only is his acting range much wider than Cruise, and his skill and subtlety much deeper, he is also much closer to the Lestat that was in my head as I read the books. Sure, he's narcissistic and tragic and conflicted, but he doesn't need to chew up the scenery (a la Cruise) to get that across to the audience. Townsend manages something that Tom Cruise never could an appealing enigma. An inspired choice! Vincent Perez turned in a good, understated performance as Marius, but I thought that Marguerite Moreau's acting was skilled, if a little TOO understated; at times, she seemed ennervated. Most of the rest of the cast members had too little time on-screen to really connect with the audience, but I must say that Paul McGann as David Talbot--the leader of the Talamasca--was flawless! When I first saw him, I thought he was Gabriel Byrne (who is surely one of the most gifted actors around). But McGann steals every scene he's in--not by acting up a storm, but by being fascinating to watch. A great actor to keep an eye on. I have to mention the special effects of Queen of the Damned; they are SPECTACULAR. I have a low tolerance for heavy-handed computerized effects, and thankfully, QotD avoids that trap, for effects that LOOK analogue (even if they are digital). There are at least 3 events in the film that left my jaw somewhere on the floor with how astoundingly good the effects were. I wish the special effects of all recent horror films were so good!I do wish there had been more sexy scenes in Queen of the Damned. Rice's books are teeming with sensuality, so I was rather surprised to find only two scenes even remotely sexy (Lestat and Akasha in the flowerpetal-strewn tub, and Lestat and Jessie at the Mt. Palomar Observatory). Due to the pacing, there was little chance for any other really sensuous moments, which was a shame, really. And the fact that they decided to try to pack so much of two books into a single movie simultaneously thwarted the expectations of many Anne Rice fans, while probably leaving those unfamiliar with the books scratching their heads about background, motivation and character development.

While he wasn't as popular as Sean Connery yet, the producers were confident that Moore would be a sufficient enough draw. Therefore, they decided to immediately start production on the ninth Bond epic, The Man With The Golden Gun. There clearly should have been a longer gap between films, as evidenced by the quality of the TMWTGG.There are so many aspects wrong with the film that it's difficult to pinpoint the absolute worst. An uneventful story that goes nowhere, abysmal acting, too much focus on comedic elements, and direction that feels like a made-for-TV-movie are all major distractions that contribute to the film's low rating, but there's also the fact that The Man with the Golden Gun is one big wasted opportunity; the film would've benefited from some tweaks to the script and a better director.The story (which takes little from Ian Fleming's novel) goes like this a golden bullet with 007 engraved on it shows up at MI6 headquarters. It's soon linked to the infamous hit man Francisco Scaramanga (Christopher Lee), nicknamed the man with the golden gun for obvious reasons. Afraid for his best agent's safety, M (Bernard Lee) pulls Bond out of his current assignment and tells him to lie low. But Bond decides to go after the hit man on his own and soon finds that they're both on the trail of the same item the solex agitator, a device that harnesses the sun's rays and converts it into energy.One of the biggest problems with the movie is the solex agitator sub-plot. By trying to capitalize on the energy crisis of the mid-seventies, the producers over-complicate a story that should've been solely based on the hunt for Scaramanga. There's a further misstep when it's revealed that the assassin has no interest in killing Bond after all; it turns out that the villain's girlfriend, Andrea Anders (played by Maud Adams, who's stuck in a thankless role) sent the golden bullet to MI6 in the hope that Bond would kill Scaramanga and free her of the hit man's grasp.This twist makes most of the film redundant&#x97;if Bond isn't interested in killing Scaramanga, should the audience care? Of course, by this point in the story, Scaramanga had taken the solex, so Bond was almost required to dispose of the killer. But then the villain's intentions are completely reversed he talks about having always wanted to duel Bond, even though earlier in the movie he said that he couldn't care less about the British spy. This change of heart only seems like a last ditch effort to justify the duel of titans featured at the end.This haphazard plotting only emphasizes the deficiency of any actual story and there are parts when the movie comes to a standstill. It's clear that Guy Hamilton was at this point completely tired of the series; his shoddy direction lacks any grandeur that even the more realistic Bond films possessed. To his credit, he did try a more low-key approach similar to Live and Let Die, but it just doesn't work; the film doesn't feel like the event a Bond film is supposed to be.It's obvious how boring the movie is when Hamilton's action scenes prove to be duller than usual. Hamilton depended on these scenes to hide his incompetent directing, and the absence of anything memorable makes the movie feel longer than it actually is. If this wasn't bad enough, the film's humour verges on the edge of self-parody and it often gets in the way of the story. The worst example of this is the scene where Bond does a 360-degree role in an AMC Hornet. The stunt was done for real and is amazing just by itself, but the producers added in a slide whistle in post-production, almost ruining the scene. In short, Hamilton's uneven direction causes the viewer to lose interest long before the end credits.As for acting, we rarely get such uninspired performances. Roger Moore was still trying to find the character and he sometimes comes across as unnatural. As the henchman, Hervé Villechaize is woefully miscast.

While he wasn't as popular as Sean Connery yet, the producers were confident that Moore would be a sufficient enough draw. Therefore, they decided to immediately start production on the ninth Bond epic, The Man With The Golden Gun. There clearly should have been a longer gap between films, as evidenced by the quality of the TMWTGG.There are so many aspects wrong with the film that it's difficult to pinpoint the absolute worst. An uneventful story that goes nowhere, abysmal acting, too much focus on comedic elements, and direction that feels like a made-for-TV-movie are all major distractions that contribute to the film's low rating, but there's also the fact that The Man with the Golden Gun is one big wasted opportunity; the film would've benefited from some tweaks to the script and a better director.The story (which takes little from Ian Fleming's novel) goes like this a golden bullet with 007 engraved on it shows up at MI6 headquarters. It's soon linked to the infamous hit man Francisco Scaramanga (Christopher Lee), nicknamed the man with the golden gun for obvious reasons. Afraid for his best agent's safety, M (Bernard Lee) pulls Bond out of his current assignment and tells him to lie low. But Bond decides to go after the hit man on his own and soon finds that they're both on the trail of the same item the solex agitator, a device that harnesses the sun's rays and converts it into energy.One of the biggest problems with the movie is the solex agitator sub-plot. By trying to capitalize on the energy crisis of the mid-seventies, the producers over-complicate a story that should've been solely based on the hunt for Scaramanga. There's a further misstep when it's revealed that the assassin has no interest in killing Bond after all; it turns out that the villain's girlfriend, Andrea Anders (played by Maud Adams, who's stuck in a thankless role) sent the golden bullet to MI6 in the hope that Bond would kill Scaramanga and free her of the hit man's grasp.This twist makes most of the film redundant&#x97;if Bond isn't interested in killing Scaramanga, should the audience care? Of course, by this point in the story, Scaramanga had taken the solex, so Bond was almost required to dispose of the killer. But then the villain's intentions are completely reversed he talks about having always wanted to duel Bond, even though earlier in the movie he said that he couldn't care less about the British spy. This change of heart only seems like a last ditch effort to justify the duel of titans featured at the end.This haphazard plotting only emphasizes the deficiency of any actual story and there are parts when the movie comes to a standstill. It's clear that Guy Hamilton was at this point completely tired of the series; his shoddy direction lacks any grandeur that even the more realistic Bond films possessed. To his credit, he did try a more low-key approach similar to Live and Let Die, but it just doesn't work; the film doesn't feel like the event a Bond film is supposed to be.It's obvious how boring the movie is when Hamilton's action scenes prove to be duller than usual. Hamilton depended on these scenes to hide his incompetent directing, and the absence of anything memorable makes the movie feel longer than it actually is. If this wasn't bad enough, the film's humour verges on the edge of self-parody and it often gets in the way of the story. The worst example of this is the scene where Bond does a 360-degree role in an AMC Hornet. The stunt was done for real and is amazing just by itself, but the producers added in a slide whistle in post-production, almost ruining the scene. In short, Hamilton's uneven direction causes the viewer to lose interest long before the end credits.As for acting, we rarely get such uninspired performances. Roger Moore was still trying to find the character and he sometimes comes across as unnatural. As the henchman, Hervé Villechaize is woefully miscast.

George Lazenby certainly thought so, and after one film, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, he bailed the franchise on the advice of his agent. The public, apparently, also agreed with Lazenby, because while OHMSS was definitely successful (every Bond film has been), it didn't do as well as Sean Connery's previous outings. This probably had to do with Connery himself not being involved with the film, so with this in his mind, producer Cubby Broccoli sought to it that his star come back.Long story short, Connery eventually agreed to star in Diamonds Are Forever. The film itself, to be blunt, is terrible, and the first real indication that Eon was getting sloppy with their execution. I won't go much into the plot because, well, there really isn't one. The film loosely follows the superior and much too maligned novel of the same name, except it adds doubles for Blofeld (played far too passively by Charles Gray, who at one point lets Bond go so he can put him in another pointless death trap when he can just shoot him right then and there!), misplaced satellites in space, diamond double-crosses that serve no purpose beyond leading Bond to Vegas, stupid characters, etc. And when we do (kind of) figure out the plan, it comes as a huge disappointment.Done right, all of this might have made for some kind of entertainment, but it all piles on until the end, when the audience it left scratching their heads and trying to make some kind of sense of the whole affair, which is of course pointless because even the filmmakers don't seem to have an idea of what's going on. So if the story is a let-down, the action must make up for it, right? Unfortunately, all the action scenes in DAF are all similar and dull. They're played mostly for laughs, too, which kills any tension that was possible. This is most obvious in the Las Vegas car chase. Of all the films, Diamonds Are Forever is surely one of the most boring and cheap-looking, with even the Ken Adam sets not matching those of the past or the future. I blame it on director Guy Hamilton, whose chases and general style didn't even come close to most other directors in the Bond canon.What's left, then? The special effects are humiliating and way too distracting. Are you telling me every explosion creates a puff of dust and then quickly disappears like an over-heated oven? Even with Connery's large pay-check taking away a large sum of the budget, these effects are embarrassing. The locations are pretty lifeless, especially the main one of Las Vegas. As I mentioned, the characters are not only boring and artificial, but the actors themselves don't bring their all, even the all-mighty Connery, who looks much, MUCH older than in You Only Live Twice and is suitably bored with the proceedings,only rarely showing the flair that he did in the previous entries.Take the ending, for example, where he strolls onto the oil rig looking like he can stop Blofeld's evil plot in no time (not that Bond even understands what's going on anyway.) Continuing with characters, two deserve singling out. Jimmy Dean as Willard Whyte, while having a blast, is completely out of place while Tiffany Case starts out as intelligent, but turns into a bumbling fool by the end who is unbelievable as an expert diamond smuggler. Probably the only characters in the film that are remotely interesting are Mister Wint and Mister Kidd, played by Bruce Glover and Putter Smith. The two make a great killer duo, and play off of each other well. Not to mention they look like they're having the time of their lives and give a believable performance at the same time. The movie has very little going for it except a haunting and memorable score from John Barry, some of the best lines in the series, and a unique fight in an elevator that seems to be one of the only things that Connery really gets into!

I've heard many say that the original '71 version is much better... believe me, I'll take your word for it, as it can't be much worse than this. Stallone can't really act, and this film shows it. The story is decent, but it never really gets the viewers interest or attention, and what you're left with is a bunch of car-chases and tough guy beating tough guy or tough guy beating weak guy fights. The plot is pretty dull, doesn't really hold your attention at all, and quickly loses your interest entirely. The acting isn't very good. The characters are pretty thin and most of them are just either tough guy clichés or weak-guy-trying-to-appear-tough clichés. The soundtrack is cool, with lots and lots of excellent techno tracks... but that's pretty much the only good thing about the film. My recommendation? Rent the soundtrack. Skip the film. For an action film, it really has little to no actual action or tension. It's all so predictable, and all of the action consists of car-chases and fighting scenes, anyway. One of the biggest reasons I watched this drab, mediocre film again was John C. McGinley. If you've read a review of mine about one of the other films I've seen which had him on the cast, then you know that I nothing short of love the guy. He's just so damn cool, and his personality works great in the film, in the character. But, alas, he has too damn little screen-time, and it's not worth sitting through the parts of the film that doesn't have him. All in all, just not really a very memorable film. The dialog tries too hard to be cool, the editing tries too hard to be stylish... the whole thing ends up as a mess.

There are even fewer who get away with it. Woody Allen is one of the exceptions to this rule though. Over his career, Allen has produced so many films staring him that they could probably be renamed the Woody series (for example Woody In The Future instead of 1973's Sleeper). In this film, the same is again true with Allen's regular screen persona this time relocated to 1930's New York. Change the date and rarely the setting however, and any film written, directed and staring Allen is always going to be worth a few viewings.Playing Insurance Investigator CW Briggs, Allen chooses in this feature to spend 98 minutes arguing with Helen Hunt and solving a superb murder mystery. Hypnotised by the Jade Scorpion, Briggs will rob and steal by night before then trying to catch himself during the day.There's a lot of harsh criticism for Woody Allen nowadays. With people either complaining that he ruins his own films or is just too old to play the roles he picks, poor old Woody is forever condemned and chastised. Ultimately though, all Allen ever does is live the regular man's dream. To be a private eye in 1930's America, or to be a saviour of the future, or to play any of the other roles Allen has done, the majority are major male fantasies. Allen's characters are always designed around his own personality and his own ability to make us laugh, but primarily Allen's characters always seem to be obsessed with sex, and who can blame him? In The Curse of the Jade Scorpion for example, Allen gives himself a character who most women tend to adore and who gets to kiss Helen Hunt and Charlize Theron. Theron in particular as Laura Kensington is drop dead gorgeous in this film, and the only major surprise is that Allen's character (although forced) rejects her and never gets to sleep with her. Allen basically gets the best characters, the best jobs and the best women, and when a man has all three of those things, truthfully, why should he really care if one or two people think he is too old for the part?The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is just another Woody vehicle really. The script is again Allen based and funny, the plot is detailed and well thought out, the acting is top notch by everyone (even the usually abysmal Elizabeth Berkley) and over all the film is hard to fault.On a side note, one thing which ALWAYS pleases about Woody Allen is the fact that he sticks to the same style of introduction. Since the turn of the millennium, a large amount of film conversation seems to have been devoted to the idea that an introduction should grab the audiences attention and make us expect something wonderful. For a lot of films, this is definitely true. With Allen however, the regular black screen with white writing is never flash and it never really grabs the attention (except perhaps noticing the familiar, unexpected name in the cast) yet it works. Ever since his earlier works, Allen has kept this style, and by keeping to it, there's a sense of familiarity and comfort. Change is good, but as Allen says in this film if something isn't broken, why fix it?So there it is. A lot of critics hate Allen for supposedly never repeating his earlier works. They compare his later films to Annie Hall (1977) and they feel undervalued. This always amazes however because whilst Allen has obviously gotten old (we all do), the guy still possesses the comic genius to make his films works.

Well, the worst mistake, evidently, is the marketing of the movie and the way the DVD might have been targeted. Obviously, this is not a true horror movie, at least, not for people expecting anything that will be gory and instantly satisfying. Wendigo is basically a film that seems to be told from the mind of the young Miles. Things that are not readily understood by children tend to stay in their young minds and ultimately dominate their fears and the menacing world they can't comprehend. It is obvious that Kim, the mother, is a psychologist, but she has no clue to what is going on in the mind of her son. This is also a story of alienation. It's clear that the father, George, is a distant figure, perhaps a workaholic, who seems to be living in a different world.Miles' fears reach a point of crisis during the week end in the country. That part of New York state, with its winter landscape, barren trees, play havoc on the little boy's imagination. It doesn't help that he encounters a strange figure in town, it creates even more doubts in his young mind. Ultimately, Miles' world comes crashing down on him and he can't do anything, even evoking the Wendigo spirit.The film is well paced and acted. Patricia Clarkson is excellent, no matter where movie she is in. Jake Weber is perfect as the distant father who has an opportunity to come closer to a son he doesn't understand. Erik Per Sullivan, as Miles, conveys the inner turmoil within him. I thought he was extremely effective since the whole movie is Miles own take on what's going on around him. Finally, John Spredakos is perfect as the menacing Otis, a man who resents the world for the way he has turned out.Instead of putting this movie down, future viewers should approach it with a open mind.

Obviously, this is not a true horror movie, at least, not for people expecting anything that will be gory and instantly satisfying. Wendigo is basically a film that seems to be told from the mind of the young Miles. Things that are not readily understood by children tend to stay in their young minds and ultimately dominate their fears and the menacing world they can't comprehend. It is obvious that Kim, the mother, is a psychologist, but she has no clue to what is going on in the mind of her son. This is also a story of alienation. It's clear that the father, George, is a distant figure, perhaps a workaholic, who seems to be living in a different world.Miles' fears reach a point of crisis during the week end in the country. That part of New York state, with its winter landscape, barren trees, play havoc on the little boy's imagination. It doesn't help that he encounters a strange figure in town, it creates even more doubts in his young mind. Ultimately, Miles' world comes crashing down on him and he can't do anything, even evoking the Wendigo spirit.The film is well paced and acted. Patricia Clarkson is excellent, no matter where movie she is in. Jake Weber is perfect as the distant father who has an opportunity to come closer to a son he doesn't understand. Erik Per Sullivan, as Miles, conveys the inner turmoil within him. I thought he was extremely effective since the whole movie is Miles own take on what's going on around him. Finally, John Spredakos is perfect as the menacing Otis, a man who resents the world for the way he has turned out.Instead of putting this movie down, future viewers should approach it with a open mind.

I believe this is the 'one thing' they were referring to in the title but it probably would take a 2nd viewing to determine what that 'one thing' is. I'm usually a sucker for off-the-wall unique stories that don't really end up anywhere but with this one you're left shaking your head almost from the beginning to the end and you figure with a unique title like this we ought to be able to figure what that 1 thing was and what the 13 conversations are. Well, this is not the case, at least not for me. We basically start the movie with John Turturro's story of being a late to home husband with a bruise on his eye that came from some encounter a few days before then we're brisked off to McConaughey's piece about a positive man who runs into some bad luck following a sermon he gives to a man at the bar about him not ever being unhappy. The rest of the stories interweave into each other before it's all done, which is an interesting concept, but it's been done much better in other films. Alan Arkin's the man at the bar and his story is confusing, to say the least. He's a mean boss who can't stand happy people. His daughter ends up being intertwined into another story and another story is about a couple of women who clean houses for a living and one of them gets into an accident that changes her life for the worse. Sorry about the rambling, but I thought I should give others all the information and see if they can come up with anything. Good luck if you choose to view this and let me know if you could figure out more than I did.

He assigns a task to them on their very first day - to somehow try to change the world - have an impact on society in some way. Generally viewed as a rhetorical mission, one child, Trevor (Played by the inimitable Haley Joel Osmont), takes it utterly seriously and sets out to make the world a better place by way of his 'pay it forward' scheme whereby you do someone a favour they cannot do for themselves, and they have to do likewise for 3 people, who have to do likewise for 3 each, and so on.When romance seems to be on the cards for Eugene and Trevor's mother Arlene, it appears one of Trevor's favours is working. However, events conspire to attempt to stick spanners in the works. As they always do...Basically this is a bit of a love story with an attempt at a moral message of 'be nice to each other and give a damn'. It's certainly helped out substantially by predictably excellent performances from the main 3 players, namely Spacey, Osment and Helen Hunt as Trevor's troubled alcoholic mother.Its problem is just that it's simply too goody goody to take seriously. It's obviously a bit of a fantasy premise but never for a second can we suspend our disbelief. And the ending is an absolute parody of the whole film and had me laughing, such was its absurdity.Yes, its well directed, well acted and the all round quality is genuine, but if the basic plot gets this unbelievable, the other aspects are futile.Reasonable family film but don't expect anything memorable.
