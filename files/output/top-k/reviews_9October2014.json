The 70s, in my opinion, were some of the greatest years in human history - unfortunately I was not around to see them. It is because of this that I did not experience the nostalgia that an older person may experience. I knew that I would not feel nostalgic going into the movie, so this did not bother nor surprise me. I thought that luckily I would have the plot and characters to be entertained by. I was wrong. Perhaps I'm being harsh here, but there was no plot. Three acts in a story does not constitute a 'beginning', 'middle' and 'end'.As for the characters...I just didn't like or relate to ANY of the characters in the movie (except maybe the one with the spectacles). I have never been whacked on the buttocks by a paddle, got laid, smoked pot or been to a 'party', so I had absolutely no connection to any of the characters whatsoever. I do have to give the movie credit, however, for accurately portraying a bunch of complete idiots. The people portrayed in this movie are people that I would willingly have no affiliation with in real life, so you can probably understand why I loathed them. At the start of the movie, they just irritated me, but by about two-thirds in, I just didn't care anymore. I mean, who gives an Oompa Loompa's anus whom is going out with whom? Or who gets on the football team? WHO CARES?! Okay, I can understand that there are people out there who have experienced the things portrayed in this movie, but for a movie to present itself solely as a flipping time capsule is just plain selfish. Movies such as Donnie Darko, The Breakfast Club, even Back to the Future are able to provide nostalgia but at the same time provide a rich, compelling story with interesting characters and innovative directing. Seeing a bunch of American teenagers act like tossers for an entire night is not fun, it is not nostalgic, it is not thought-provoking. The only scene in the whole movie that was REALLY any good was at the end when the main character stands up to the football coach by refusing to sign the paper. That was nice! That was actually a good scene, and it made the point it was trying to make very, very well.Once again I credit the movie for the accurate portrayal of complete morons - seriously, I was utterly convinced. The script was dead-on in its depiction of a bunch of idiots trying to seem 'edgy' by smoking weed. I must admit I did laugh at some of the dialogue as well (the George Washington conspiracy theory was particularly amusing). Still, this movie did absolutely nothing for me. It was a vapid, empty, soulless experience. I mildly enjoyed the experience of being taken to another setting, but when that setting is inhabited by mindless idiots it is a little hard to have a good time. The soundtrack, yes, was excellent. But a good film does a pleasant soundtrack not make. I could just go on the internet and listen to a bunch of these 70s hits (isn't it funny how it was only future well-known songs they played back in 1976), and that way I don't need to have good music accompanied by the asinine antics of a group of quasi-rebellious cretins.Richard Linklater has done well in presenting us with a portrayal of life as an American dunderhead (pleonasm), but when in doing so he is insulting anybody that wasn't alive then, considering he has provided them with no plot or innovative direction for them to enjoy, it is a right pain; why should I enjoy your film, Mr Linklater, if you do not give two single shinkansens whether I do or not? Okay, you didn't make it for me, I get it!

But Marnie neither did well at the box office nor attracted much praise. In fact, it signalled the beginning of a series of Hitchcock films that were received poorly throughout the remainder of the 60's. Over the years though the reputation of Marnie definitely seems to have improved and this seems pretty fair; it is a far more interesting film than the routine spy thrillers Torn Curtain (1966) and Topaz (1969) and really has quite a few good things about it.It was based on the novel by Winston Graham of the same name. It follows the book reasonably closely with the notable exception of the ending. It focuses on a young woman called Marnie who is a compulsive thief who also has revulsion of sex. Her new boss, Mark, catches her stealing money from his business and blackmails her into marriage. The story then follows both these characters in their troubled relationship. It's quite clear it's not just Marnie who has inner demons but Mark's actions, too, mark him out as a man with some issues. At one point he forces himself on his wife in a way that is tantamount to rape. The way the film deals with this could be seen as a little troubling as Mark is generally painted quite sympathetically but when you consider this scene, he becomes a little difficult to get on board with. I'm guessing that the dark, complex psychology that permeates the film was most probably one of the reasons it didn't resonate as strongly at the box office as anticipated.Tippi Hedren returns to the ice blonde leading lady role again after her debut in Hitchcock's previous hit The Birds. Her role here is a much more complex one though but she puts in a pretty good account of herself. She is accompanied by Sean Connery at the peak of his powers off the back of the early James Bond films and he does provide welcome star power, even if his accent is hard to explain here! While the extremely alluring Diane Baker also makes an indelible mark as Mark's smart sister-in-law. An aspect that seems to have been understandably seen as an issue is the use of back projections and artificial painted backdrops. The former had been systematically used by Hitchcock in other films, presumably to allow for perfect control of lighting, although I do agree that it often looks somewhat unnecessarily distracting. On the other hand, the painted backdrop used for the waterfront scene at Marnie's mother's house may well have looked very fake but I felt it gave off a strange dreamlike ambiance which gave her family home an off-kilter feel which suited it. And given the events detailed in the flash-back ending, the unsettling oddness seems quite apt. If I had to really find criticism of Marnie it would probably be to suggest that it does have pacing problems in the middle and could perhaps have benefited from being a little shorter. A tighter run-time would have served it much better in my view. But all-in-all, it has enough edginess and style to ensure that it's another fine Hitchcock for me.

You can put as much CGI and cell phone usage in a remake as you want, modernizing it doesn't make something good. To me the original will always be better, hands-down.What's sad about Drop Dead Fred is that the girl in it has a very controlling mother who wants her daughter, above all else, to be a normal so that she can keep her own high reputation. Her husband loves Elizabeth, or Lizzie, and encourages her to use her imagination. When Lizzie invents an imaginary friend, Drop Dead Fred, a mischievous man with bright orange hair and a British accent, her mom is furious. She believes her child may need psychiatric care and medication for having a pretend friend, and after separating Lizzie from her beloved friend her husband becomes frustrated and leaves.As Lizzie grows up grounded in reality, it isn't all her mom cracked it up to be. Lizzie is forced to move back in with her mom and ends up reuniting with Drop Dead Fred, much to her mom's horror. She immediately wants Lizzie put on a medication that will kill off Drop Dead Fred, without her daughter's consent, but somehow Drop Dead Fred survives.Believe me, keeping an imaginary friend a secret as an adult isn't easy by any means. It's considered normal when you're six but as you get to be a teenager, and then an adult, it's not just cute to adults, it's considered weird, wrong and insane. This movie terrified me when I first saw it; I was fifteen and knew very little about medication, and honestly believed that the fictional normal pills in the movie really existed. What I discovered when I got older, equally disturbing, is that many medications used to treat supposed and real mental illnesses are often not recommended for or tested with children and teens, but they are still prescribed in Canada.The acting in this movie is amazing, especially from Phoebe Cates, who also stared as Kate in the 1980's Christmas horror classic Gremlins. Rick Mayall and Ashley Peldon were also really great in their roles. The soundtrack was pretty good and the story certainly is original, with slight similarities to the books Syd the Imaginary Friend by Alice Dawn and Magic by William Goldman.The strained relationship between Lizzie and her snotty mom is incredibly depressing to watch. There are tons of modern moms out there who say that raising a child with a solid plan, grounded in reality from the day they're born, is the best way. They don't want their children to have an imagination at all. To take away something like that from a child's life is not only harmful, but it stops them from leading their own unique life. And imaginary friends, at least in my opinion, are not dangerous or unhealthy for children or adults to have, so long as they aren't a malevolent voice whispering to harm others or whispering suicidal thoughts. Anyone can have an imaginary friend and lead a productive life as long as they still have some sense of what's imaginary and what's real. Some imaginary friends might be a child's only support in times of abuse, divorce, tragedy, etc. The same goes for adults.I really hope this wonderful film isn't dragged into the remake heap of today's generation. It does have mild crude humor and bad language, but in moderation. Drop Dead Fred is one of the most original films out there and doesn't need a remake to be timeless, I'd recommend it any day over a remake.

She believes her child may need psychiatric care and medication for having a pretend friend, and after separating Lizzie from her beloved friend her husband becomes frustrated and leaves.As Lizzie grows up grounded in reality, it isn't all her mom cracked it up to be. Lizzie is forced to move back in with her mom and ends up reuniting with Drop Dead Fred, much to her mom's horror. She immediately wants Lizzie put on a medication that will kill off Drop Dead Fred, without her daughter's consent, but somehow Drop Dead Fred survives.Believe me, keeping an imaginary friend a secret as an adult isn't easy by any means. It's considered normal when you're six but as you get to be a teenager, and then an adult, it's not just cute to adults, it's considered weird, wrong and insane. This movie terrified me when I first saw it; I was fifteen and knew very little about medication, and honestly believed that the fictional normal pills in the movie really existed. What I discovered when I got older, equally disturbing, is that many medications used to treat supposed and real mental illnesses are often not recommended for or tested with children and teens, but they are still prescribed in Canada.The acting in this movie is amazing, especially from Phoebe Cates, who also stared as Kate in the 1980's Christmas horror classic Gremlins. Rick Mayall and Ashley Peldon were also really great in their roles. The soundtrack was pretty good and the story certainly is original, with slight similarities to the books Syd the Imaginary Friend by Alice Dawn and Magic by William Goldman.The strained relationship between Lizzie and her snotty mom is incredibly depressing to watch. There are tons of modern moms out there who say that raising a child with a solid plan, grounded in reality from the day they're born, is the best way. They don't want their children to have an imagination at all. To take away something like that from a child's life is not only harmful, but it stops them from leading their own unique life. And imaginary friends, at least in my opinion, are not dangerous or unhealthy for children or adults to have, so long as they aren't a malevolent voice whispering to harm others or whispering suicidal thoughts. Anyone can have an imaginary friend and lead a productive life as long as they still have some sense of what's imaginary and what's real. Some imaginary friends might be a child's only support in times of abuse, divorce, tragedy, etc. The same goes for adults.I really hope this wonderful film isn't dragged into the remake heap of today's generation. It does have mild crude humor and bad language, but in moderation. Drop Dead Fred is one of the most original films out there and doesn't need a remake to be timeless, I'd recommend it any day over a remake.

The fact it's taken me thirteen years to watch a movie staring my childhood crush Diane Lane, the always usually reliable Stellan Skarsgard and one of my favourite young actress's of the era Leelee Sobieski says how badly this movie did and was reviewed upon release. When Ruby (Sobieski) and Rhett Baker's parents are killed in a car accident, they must travel to Malibu, to live with Terrence and Erin Glass, their former neighbours. But they are not the friendly couple the claim to be. The movie is massively flawed in several areas, I have never seen Lane put in a performance this bad before, and likewise Skarsgard puts in a career low performance. Only Sobieski puts in a good performance, and she certainly fills out a bikini nicely. Both talented and attractive in equal measure, it's because of her the movie succeeds where it does. I'm amazed her career never hit higher heights. Bruce Dern pops up in a role as a lawyer and he is also OK. A lot of my problems with this movie are more to do with the script and it's direction.It is lazily shot with just the actors seemingly placed in front of the camera. As for the script it does not have a natural flow with lots of things going on all at once and lots of things unexplained as characters come and go.Outside of Sobieski, there is little to enjoy, but another asset to this movie is the score. It hits all the rights spots, at all the right times. Despite everything I think the premise of the movie is a good one, and with Sobieski at the lead it's more than watchable. I think released a month earlier, this would have done very differently. A 7\/10 is a generous score, but since the movie was carried solely by Sobieski it's a worthy one.

","genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"9 October 2014","score":"","review":" I thought the music in this film was not bad-maybe a bit 'draggy' at times (pardon the pun)- but as the film draws to an end the true nature-the true not Transgender nature of the person playing the lead comes out. Ooops. I was hoping it would actually have been a Transgender person-but rather it was an actor playing a Transgender person-albeit effectively-but in this day an age if you want to represent an Asian person in a movie for example you don't use facial prosthetics on a Caucasian actor's eyes-you hire an Asian actor. David Bowie's involvement in the play this movie was based on makes it noteworthy in the minds of fans of David Bowie. There is Bowiesque music in it but I am hearing more Lou Reed aka CBGB's NYC punk circa 1970-which isn't bad-but again-it isn't actually rock tunes written by a Transgender musician. In a way I think this film defines the worst kind of scam-in another way its just good harmless fun. A drag queen called Jinx Monsoon or something close to that seemed to have been the only person with an 'alternate sexuality' involved with this play at any level at any venue & it has played at a few. One of the musicians in the band appeared to be a 'drag king' but other than that there was nobody else 'different.' I wondered if it was based on someone real but if it was that was never mentioned-or I missed it. Cute film-but it was what it was, so I just gave it a five. Some of the dialogue was...thoughtful-but it didn't come from a ...you get the picture.
