In the state of California a young Neo-Nazi skinhead called Derek Vinyard(Edward Norton) is arrested and jailed for the violent killings of two coloured men who were trying to steal his van. Then while serving his sentence Vinyard slowly begins to realise just how wrong he was to do all the savage things he did. Derek vows that on the day of his realise he shall be a reformed man and is determined to save his younger brother Danny(Edward Furlong) from adopting to the same life style he had once lead due to the fact that he has already fallen under the influence of Cameron Alexander the older man who had convinced Derek to set up the white power movement that he use to lead, while destroying shops in their area which were owned by foreign businessmen. The story is very well written and makes it easy to understand all the characters. The ending is a bit of a shocker but still powerful as it remains us that every racial group on this earth can be racist not just the while people. Edward Norton's acting as Derek Vinyard in this movie was legendary and easily his best performance so far, passing Fight Club by miles in my opinion. I here he was up for an occur back in 1998 for his role in American History X and was only denied it due to all the controversial scenes in the movie, which I fell was a real shame as he really deserved it much more that anyone else that year. Edward Furlong is also excellent in his role as Danny Vinyard and was a really good narrator throughout the film. The rest of the cast which included Avery Brooks, Ethan Suplee, Fairuza Balk and Stacy Keach are also terrific.This movie is one of the best and most powerful pieces of acting I've ever seen in my life and I'm actually quite surprised its only ranked at number 60 instead of in the IMDb top 20, but oh well I guess popularity polls can never be the exact why you would wish them to be. Anyway this movie has lots of important lessons to teach its viewer and I would suggest everyone to watch it. I overall give American History X a definite 10\/10 stars.

It never seems to take itself real seriously (and I think that's because the writers knew that they couldn't come up with a more interesting\/original twist with how Mel acquires his secret power). Nevertheless, a guy could really learn a thing or two about how women think after watching this. It's not the gospel, but there's a little room for tact in every man, and this movie delivers it while entertaining you at the same time.Mel Gibson is Nick Marshall, a CEO of a Chicago advertising firm and a pompous, arrogant, superficial, Frank Sinatra-loving playboy\/bachelor\/jerk at the same time. He is accidentally electrocuted when sampling some complementary women's products only to be able to hear the mind's voices of what every woman is thinking when he comes to. He's terrified at first, but after seeing his shrink (a cameo from Bette Midler), he embraces his new power. It helps him compete in his job with rival Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt) as well as construct a relationship with his estranged daughter (Ashley Johnson), and land the cute aspiring actress-turned coffee shop barista Marisa Tomei, into bed.The film is light and funny throughout, but begins not to know what to do with itself within the final twenty minutes. Basically the first half is cute, but then it seems to get over-sentimental and sappy. The love theme between Gibson and Hunt works off their chemistry, but it is also a tired and contrived requisite in today's romantic comedies. I love the stumbling in the park and the different thoughts to every female (along with the poodle and her French accent). And the scene where Mel and Marisa are going to get it on is a hoot. I love his mannerisms when he tells Marisa later that he's gay. Little touches like this also include Mel imitating Sean Connery's way of saying adversary when channel surfing. And later, Gibson sobs while watching Richard Simmons. And I know Mel had to be the sensitive, caring, good ole dad to his rather unattractive daughter (I just don't buy that Gibson and Lauren Holly could have a kid that ugly), but that's when the story began to derail.There are many rising stars who have gone on to other projects since, like bits parts from Mark Feuerstein, Sarah Paulson, Judy Greer, Lisa Edelstein, Loretta Devine and others.

The way this film is told is brilliant and I'm not surprised it won the many coveted awards it did as it certainly deserved them. Best film of 1984.

A play first staged on Broadway, Alan Jay Lerner's and Frederic Loewe's first popular hit was done with human beings, lighting, effects and music. As a film., director Joshua Logan opened the production out; he showed men trekking West in a fantastic array of wagons and rolling vehicles, founding a city amid tall trees in the hills of California, striking gold and building their town No Name City from nothing. The feature was scenic, big in appearance, outdoor-oriented, spacious and colorful I suggest--and he downplayed the musical numbers with the exception of They Call the Wind Maria. So, we as appreciators and viewers of his large-scale work need to look at how and why he did what he did to make this a very cinematic experience--one which begins by the camera resolving fractured or hazy images into clear forms and which ends with an opposite devolution as the city's dwellers trek off to the next goldfield and vanish like the elements of an improbable mirage or fever-dream. Logan had directed Picnic with extraordinary skill, moving it to real locations and out-of- doors; but the difference was that he then had a cast of mostly stage-trained actors to work with. Here, his attempt as in South Pacific to use plausible physical types and not trained actors did not work as well, once again, I suggest. In a musical, singers are not always good actors--which is why they are frequently replaced on soundtracks by dubbed voices of singers; and so the director's priorities are to find the right actors if he is having them sing or else plausible actors among available singers. The story-line of Paint Your Wagon, as written for the screen by naturalistic author Paddy Chayefsky and Lerner, is amusing but not important. The narrative follows men West who are misfits, seekers after gold, and\/or men with an inordinate desire, wish or lust of some sort. These men find gold in California's hills; they labor months on short rations under rain, stormwinds, cold, privation and loneliness. And two strike up a firm friendship as a tent city is raised--bright, moody, hard-drinking Ben Rumson (Lee Marvin) and Pardner, a Man who is obviously new to the West. The two eventually end up agreeing with the young woman who suggests the solution to the fact that she is in love with both of them, Elizabeth (Jean Seberg), that she ought to marry both of them at once. This is a mining camp--no one objects. From this point on, the wild West becomes even wilder. The men hijack a stagecoach after holding a huge meeting to discuss the action. And its cargo is brought to No Name City--six shady Gallic ladies. The growth and wildness of the place continues unabated. There are saloons erected, gambling houses running full-bore and vast underground tunneling operations being conducted. Instead of the gentle I Talk to the Trees, the evocative Paint Your Wagon, and I Still See Luisa now the songs become hard-edged, Gold and I Was Born Under a Wand'rin' Star. There is rough humor involving Ben introducing a young man to sex with the help of the Madam of the local cathouse and being amazed by his progress. There are arguments between Ben and Pardner. And Elizabeth finally refusing to leave the house they build for her, as a wild-eyed preacher predicts the fall of No Name City--and watches as it collapses as if on cue as a bull stampedes down the main thoroughfare. The qualities of the film are opulent but a bit inconsistent. William A Fraker was the feature's cinematographer, John Truscott did the good production design. Carl Braunger did the vivid art direction and the set decorations were supplied by James L. Berkey. John Truscot also designed the many admirable costumes. In the cast, Lee Marvin dominates in a nearly-award-caliber and lively attempt. His renditions of Gold and Wanderin' Star are very effective despite his lack of singing ability. Clint Eastwood is pleasant and adequate as Pardner, even though he cannot sing at all. Jean Seberg is rather good as Elizabeth, showing maturity as a star performer. Others in the numerous cast include Alan Dexter as the dynamic preacher, Ray Walston (charismatic) as Mad Jack, Harve Presnell, Benny Baker, H.B. Haggerty, Tom Ligon, H.W. Gim and Robert Easton, Carl Bruck, Alan Baxter and Paula Trueman. The film has the defects of director Logan's methods as noted above. I assert; but the film's breezy success as an entertainment owes much to Logan's eye for physical and interpersonal moments the staging of They Call The Wind Maria to symbolize the loneliness of a grey winter; and the cheerful industry of the miners singing Gold as they tunnel happily away, the great meeting etc. I admire much of the film's drive and attempted realism; and I appreciate many of its best moments, its lighting, its lack of pretension. I saw the film in New York City in 1969; and I still enjoy it as much as ever without being insensible of its imperfections.

Because Bruce Willis is in it, they chose to make it out to contain tons of action and heroic combat! They also chose to make it appear to be a Bruce Willis vehicle. Let me tell you, if you are renting or buying it for either of the above reasons, you will hate it! The combat action scenes are sparse (two scenes) and extremely short (though very exciting when they do occur. And Bruce Willis is really a supporting actor to Farrel - in fact, of the major characters, he probably has less screen time than anyone else, and is rarely seen outside of Farrel's perspective.The Good So, the first thing you need to do is lay aside your expectation of a SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or GUNS OF NAVARONNE type movie. This is a drama! And it is a very good one. There are several layers to this story - one is that of Lt. Hart's (Colin Farrel) need for redemption after an early failure in the film. His assignment to defend the falsely accused marine gives him that chance. The main story is the trial of a marine who asserts he was framed for the murder of a fellow marine in the stockade. Farrel quickly learns that the cards are stacked against him as the presiding officer McNamara (Willis) seems bent on a guilty verdict. This sets up some very tense confrontations between the two.Adding a second layer to this drama is the apparently misunderstood character of the commanding Nazi officer Werner Visser. Visser represents an aging officer who has wound up in a remote post and seems to have accepted this lesser role. He is a foil to Willis's McNamara, who wants nothing more than to get back to the war. The confusion as to why Visser suddenly wants to help Hart is that people perceive this as Visser suddenly becoming the nice Nazi. Well, anyone paying attention can see that Visser is ONLY motivated by getting back at McNamara. Hart is a convenient tool to do so - but there is not fondness for Hart from Visser, as you will see by the film's end.The third layer is that of the racist motivation behind the original crime. Two of the confined officers are African-American, and they are portrayed in a very heroic light here - but the white enlisted men are very prejudiced to their presence (this is the 40s, remember). This gives ample opportunity to see racism as it truly is - these are fine outstanding officers, but their contributions are ignored by those who only see the color of their skin.Combining these three threads takes a skillful director, and Hoblit shows himself up to the task. The film never loses momentum, but switches nicely between the various threads. The writing is crisp, the cinematography is appropriately drab and dreary in its own beautiful way (love the light beams coming through the barrack windows) and the few actions scenes keep the excitement level high. All told, this is an excellent movie, and one I am proud to own - it's a shame more people will miss out on it because of the critics who didn't get it.The Bad That is not to say it is the perfect film.

Carpenter decided wisely to remain faithful to the original story line and created a dark and depressing movie about alien mutations and co-habitation within humans. He also create an atmosphere of hopelessness with no light at the end of the tunnel. This film is also the first part of his Apocalyptic Trilogy.A group of scientist and technicians are living inside a U.S. research base in the middle of Antarctica. Nothing but the cold and cabin fever accompanies them. One day they get a taste of excitement when a helicopter from a nearby Norwegian research base is chasing a dog. They fail to kill the dog and die in the process. The guys were left wondering why they wanted to kill that husky so bad. unfortunately they do find out but by then it's too late. A mutating copy cat alien is living within the base. One by one it kills off the crew refusing to show itself. Paranoia and madness soon sets in and no one trusts anyone. By the end of the film, the men destroy their own refuge. The last two survivors sit in the ruins not trusting one another and die in the cold Antarctic wastelands with weapons in hand waiting for the other to show their true self.Another great film from John Carpenter. Too bad he couldn't keep the streak going. His next film was a unwise choice. Due to the lack of box office drawing power, Carpenter was forced to jump on the Stephen King band wagon and adapt one of his works for the silver screen. It was a failure as well, but nowhere as cool as THE THING.Highly recommended.

Idealistic and naive he falls prey to a rival bowler's plot to remove his competition and ends up losing a hand. Interesting plot so far. What is done with it is supposed to be a rip roaring slap-your-knee laugh fest. Well I've laughed more at online postings than I did well watching this. Maybe I just don't get the Farrelly brothers type of humor if that's what you call it. There's a bunch of sight gags that go nowhere and look really lame. There are jokes that you see coming a mile off and just repeat themselves. There are some usual disgusting scenes that make you cringe. What this movie doesn't seem to have is any originality. OK so there's an Amish bowler but he comes off as stupid just so we can laugh at the predictable stupid things he does. Like the other characters he's two-dimensional and not that likable. It's a shame that a otherwise talented cast is stuck with this turkey on their resumes.

Noticed the scene where Bond takes the Mustang down the alley, and tilts it up on two wheels; when the car starts back down on 4 wheels, it is on the wrong side. Maybe I missed something, or an intervening scene was cut. By the way, which hotel was cast as The Whyte House in Vegas? Also, is it true that the two goofy thugs who worked for Blofeld and followed Bond around, were supposed to be gay? If so, what did that add to the story? Was it just something I missed, or were there obvious indications to this? Also, the dumb-acting female (...you stupid twit...) really detracted from the experience for me.

I've only watched it two times on ABC because I haven't had the chance to buy it or rent it from Blockbuster. I had no idea Jennifer Grey was 27 at the time she made the movie, because she was very convincing as a teenager. Compared to some women in Hollywood she has a very flat chest, which is why I was fooled so easily about her age. So both physically and emotionally, Grey pulls off playing a teen very well. I also loved the dancing--who WOULDN'T? Both times I've watched Dirty Dancing, I keep wanting to look up dance classes. I also love the soundtrack, and I do recognize some of the songs from when I was eight or nine. I would LOVE to be able to watch this in my drama class, and I'm going to ask my teacher at some point if there's any part of the movie he can use for educational purposes. It's much better than the stuff he made us watch last year. And the ending was absolutely FANTASTIC. That's one of the best moments in the film.I can't believe I'm looking forward to the first day back to school because of Dirty Dancing!

He turns, sees the figure of an Icky Undead Guy, and is then promptly decapitated with a swing of Undead Guy's sword. Th'end.Am I right about that scene being the odd one out?
