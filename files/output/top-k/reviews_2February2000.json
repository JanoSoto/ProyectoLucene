After all, the child is older than the adult by a generation and therefore, evolutionarily speaking, the adult's elder. The idea that a child might be wiser than the adult is plausible since the child is not yet corrupted by the prejudices and delusions of the current society, and may see things more clearly than we can. If I had made this film, I would have worked on those ideas. Still I doubt success since what is really necessary is an illumination of Tibetan Buddhism, which is beyond the reach of a general audience.What Jean-Jacques Annaud does is keep the camera on his star, Brad Pitt, and hope Pitt's charisma will carry the film. It does not, although Pitt does a commendable job, his accent fading in and out notwithstanding. It's just that without any real tension in the story, the film is just a picturesque travelogue, and not a very good one at that. There is no attempt to come to grips with Tibetan society nor with the issues surrounding the Communist aggression. Annaud does work hard on the relationship between Harra and the Dalai Lama, achieving unfortunately a sort of Western mid-brow comprehension. I was going to say news magazine comprehension, but it doesn't even reach that. Harra shows the kid how to work gadgets and trades some superficial knowledge of the world while learning humility and social responsibility. The unavoidable irony that Harra plays the father to the Dalai Lama instead of his own son was agreeable although acted out with entirely too much familiarity. Worse fault though is to just present the child as the Dalai Lama without attempting to show why a child is chosen in the first place. Just to illustrate how far from the reality of Tibetan Buddhism this film was, let me ask the question, why not a girl?(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

Good comedy is harder to write and perform than almost any other genre and yet great films like Groundhog Day are constantly ignored when the Academy issues it's nominees. It seems that to win, or even be nominated all you have to do is set your drama in the late part of the last century. Among Groundhog Day's 1993 contemporaries are the Piano, Remains of the Day, Schindler's List and Philadelphia. Worthy films all and while there may not be a dry eye in the house for any of them, there surely aren't too many laughs either! Don't get me wrong, you won't guffaw your way through this film in the way you might at say, the Naked Gun films or South Park but it is an excellently scripted and crafted piece by Harold Ramis (famed as Egon in Ghostbusters). Ramis and Murray do appear to have an exceptional working chemistry having also collaborated on the under-rated Stripes waaaay back in the 80s. That chemistry is obvious here as Bill Murray puts in what was at that point arguably his best performance. I'm not an Andie MacDowell fan by any stretch of the imagination but she is well cast here as the prissy producer to Murray's cynical Weatherman.  Also of note is Chris Elliot who you may recognise as Woogie from There's something about Mary. Elliot carries off the part of long suffering and desperate cameraman Larry with some aplomb and I find it a shame that he does not do more work in the film industry, if only so he'd stop doing those awful Baked Tostito's ads!While it certainly didn't deserve to win the 1994 Best Picture Oscar, it could certainly have merited a nomination. Groundhog Day is though very deserving of it's top 250 position on IMDB, although it could justify being a little higher in my opinion. It is over sentimental in parts but that could just be the cynical Brit coming out in me ) ","genre":null},{"date":"2 February 2000","score":"","review":"  It never ceases to baffle me why there is no Award for good comedies.
