I mean you end up sort of understanding everything, but a part of your brain just doesn't click with total comprehension. Having said that, I love it! The director threw a major bulls-eye on virtually all counts. The performances are bizarre, but so well done and the style, which really defines this movie, is your basic blast of fresh air. When you listen to the director and how incredibly budget strapped he was, you gain total respect for what he was able to do here. There are so so many films that have unlimited cashola, that are utter crap. Not to say, this chap might not do the same on a bigger film, but here he gives us one that if not for the brilliant way it was shot, well it could easily have been pretty awful. The cast again, some really big names who were obviously just totally on the wavelength of the idea and did an art for arts sake good deed, giving just absolutely first rate performances. Just nice to see and nicer still to enjoy. Good job too with the soundtrack if I may say so. Bully!!!

What strikes me about Bardot's powerful sexuality is that cinema really hadn't seen anything like it before she came around.  The closest example I can think of in American film might be Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not, but even that misses the mark.  Bardot was not only a beautiful woman but she had a fun, mischievous and freedom-loving spirit and a fiery mind lurking around behind her sometimes poorly written characters, and these things make her even more attractive.  Plus, she had a great voice.  Which is why I was stunned to see a trailer for _Et Dieu... créa la femme_ dubbed into English at the end of the subtitled version.  The woman doing Bardot's voice sounded awful, and so much of Brigitte's sexuality was lost. Imagine Bacall telling Bogie You know how to whistle, don't you Steve? in a squeaky, high-pitched voice.  Would she be as sexy?  I don't think so.  Yet people watching the dubbed version of this film are getting something similar.  As far as the film itself goes, most everything has already been said in other comments.  Bardot does a great job as Juliette - who else could have done the role so well? - and Jurgens was quite good as Eric Carradine.  The setting is luscious and fits perfectly with Bardot's character and the overall mood of the tale.  The music is excellent, from the title sequence at the beginning through the dance scene at the end.  The story can be cliched at times and there are definitely machista elements.  But it's not a bad story either, with good tension created between the brothers.  The fight sequences, as someone else mentioned, are laughable and poorly done.  But it doesn't really matter.  It's Bardot's show all the way - from her nude Cinemascope sunbathing shot that opens the film, with the witty dialog between her and Jurgens, to her erotic dance that serves as the climax of the story.  Along the way we get several nice scenes that show her broader persona, including the one where she sets the bird and rabbit free in the field, and the scene in the bookstore with the woman from the orphanage.

His frustration at Anakin's arrogance and the fact that he has to some how live up to his own mentor Qui Gon Jinn is portrayed brilliantly  - and oh so subtle. Awesome performance from him. Portman and Christensen were acting like pieces of wood, and Savage Garden definitely had a role in the script, but as I've pointed out, nobody in the originals really acted all that well either, how can anybody be expected to act well here?

I haven't ever heard a good word about this film. But it's really not that bad, if; you can bring yourself to sit through it a few times. Perhaps this movie in fact proves Spielberg's genius since when he misfires like he does here, he is able to arouse such deep negative feelings. Who knows, I remember watching it the first time and getting progressively angry as the movie unfolded. It just seemed like cliché after cliché, and an odd uncharacteristic rip off of so many other films and stories.

However, the movie has a certain charisma to it that is hard to shake. The cinematography is quite appealing, Banderas and Salma Hayek are great together, and the ever-present strains of Latino-sounding music playing in the background, not to mention the guitar-playing sub-theme, are mind blowing. (The title track, Cancion del Mariachi by Los Lobos really makes you want to get up and dance.)I also like how the two characters played by Banderas and Hayek see the moral ambiguities of their surroundings. One quote by Banderas sums it up It's strange how pulling a trigger is easier than playing the guitar. Easier to destroy, than to create. Banderas even says a prayer that I swear I myself have uttered into the mirror Give me the strength to be what I was, and forgive me for what I am.In spite of the themes of violence and revenge, the movie never lets the violence take itself too seriously. It's hard not to notice the numerous uses of comedic relief in the movie. Which makes it all the more enjoyable.

Sadly this film is not really in its league, despite a bigger budget and more ground coverage. The main problem is that the authors clearly love the original and this leaves so much of what happens as a question mark to the new viewer. Characters are thrown in from nowhere and Carters involvement with his bosses' girl is almost in another movie.

The fight between Stallone and Mickey Rouke (here playing a buisnessman-stroke-creep) for example.This film features interesting cinematography, with strange forward jump cuts (ripped off from The Limey), odd angles and the use of colour filters. In short, the producers trying to make more out of the material than is in the script. The choice of a wet Seattle is also curious and different. Presumably the nearest to Newcastle-Upon-Tyne (the setting of the original) that the producers could think of. So it is only an average product, but will see much worse than this in our lifetime and it does move along at a fair and steady clip.

As a teenage boy back then, I also registered the attractive mother Robinson, and even more so the disturbingly beautiful elder daughter Robinson; I have heard that I am not alone in this.The film goes to great efforts to reverse all those impressions! It starts by throwing some of the most mind-blowing space battle special effects I have seen; the producers are obviously guys who have learned their lessons from 2001 Space Odyssey and Star Wars, and who have all the computing power they need. Silicon Graphics is a computer manufacturer who gets its name into the script, go figure.Is this the point to carp at the unreality of the sounds made in space where you really can't hear any whoosh or boom as things explode, or at the fighters that manoeuvre in 3D, aim weapons and even nudge one another, all by manual pilot control ? Nah, that's an accepted style these days so let it pass.The puerile homophobic dialog between the pilots (after their fighters contact in flight Does that mean we are going steady together now?) I chose to forgive in view of the magnificent graphics, but unfortunately such lines come back again and again in the miscast trying-to-be macho Major Don West's (Matt LeBlanc) passes at the cold-fish elder Robinson daughter Judy (Heather Graham).Sadly it quickly becomes evident that Major Don's pursuit of Judy is to be a running subtheme through the movie. I say sadly because this is not Hepburn and Bogart, nor a school prom B-movie, and the characterisation neither serves the movie nor the viewer. (Don to Judy I'll be happy to let you investigate my dimensions - oh puh-lease!) There simply is no chemistry between these two and their lines are a yawn because we don't need them to romance in this movie.I said that the producers make great efforts, and those on space graphics are successful. Other efforts are on the family relationships, so much so that I became convinced that Walt Disney scriptwriters must have been involved. The younger Robinson children characters work well I liked the sulky rebellious teenage daughter Penny (Lacey Chabert) though the dramatic device of her wrist-worn video diary was strained, and I was rooting for the son Will (Jack Johnson) who nearly makes a time machine for a school project, and repeatedly saves the day by tinkering with or remote-controlling the robot, who has grown from the capable but relay-filled Robbie of the TV series (adopted from the pre-computing Forbidden Planet movie of 1956) into a mightier cargo-handling monster, a Rambler-Crane model we are told, that owes much to its brother that Sigourney Weaver drives in the second Aliens movie I saw. This Robbie is bigger but less interesting for all its weaponry; by this time we have a right to expect more from a robot than this one delivers.Unfortunately the movie's main familial theme of How Can Father Robinson Show That He Really Loves His Son Will left me cold, though it may go down well with a certain kind of American audience. This is worse than just a failed theme, it is supposed to motivate the final denouement that I can't spoil for you because I still don't understand it! Suffice to say that it involves time travel (more by machinus ex deia than deus ex machina) with by now rather overloaded special effects, that serve to gloss over with thunder\/lightning\/earthquakes such paradoxes as persons meeting their time-travelled selves, that obscuration also having become a Hollywood cliche since movies like Philadelphia Experiment and Final Countdown. A shame because intelligent time-travel themes have provided, and will continue to provide, some wonderful movie scripts.The whole movie is, like the Robinsons' spaceship, a concatenation of expensive items that are individually impressive and collectively ineffective. Not to be outdone are the horrid space spiders. These seem to be downplayed to limit their horror potential; I think we get just a tiny glimpse of blue (?) gore as a spider leg gets chopped. We think the Robinsons escape from the spiders, but in true Hollywood horror tradition we were only supposed to think that and one spider makes a surprising return in the denouement, and I can't explain that either. It is actually very strange to see a thing that seems to have strayed into the movie from another film set (The Fly ? The Seventh Seal ?) too late in the script to be meaningful in the plot, and apparently also with its horror potential kept down, I suppose to keep a juvenile audience rating.Yet another yawn item to mention in the movie is a computer generated monkey Blarp that is a baby she (we are told, perhaps because a she-chimp is less demanding to model ?). For all her blinky cartoon eyes, Blarp fails to impress me as cute or useful, and she also seems like a character that strayed in by mistake from another movie.After watching all the movie action I feel I was served an assembly of highly crafted but utterly unoriginal elements. Yet for the earlier space graphics, which nearly rate up there with those in Starship Troopers, I can allow the rest as entertainment.Can you believe that the end credits really spoiled the film for me? I don't think I am peculiarly sensitive about end credits, and I am as likely as anyone to leave the movie theater as soon as they start scrolling. But in this movie the end credits are used as an opportunity to dump a lot of inappropriate music and silly graphical effects, to no good purpose.

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be on this planet.One day, after losing his clothes in a game of strip poker with a gang of old women, Dylan sees a beautiful woman (Sophie Marceau) living a few apartments down from him, playing an instrument and sitting by a window at night so naked men like Dylan can stand right outside, stare at her, and not be seen.

So a film of the book 'The Bridges of Madison County' did not fill me with joy and pleasureable anticpation.Yet Clint Eastwood has waved a magic wand, and worked wonders on the lack lustre source material, by pairing it down to produce a beautiful, warm film with only one real flaw (more on that later)The film's overwhelming main strength is the casting of Meryl Streep. As Francesca she dissolves into the role - at times her gestures and dialogue seem so natural and unforced it is as if Eastwood had installed a fly-on-the-wall camera into the house of a real Iowan housewife. She lifts the film - which does centre on themes which could appear trite in the wrong hands - to the level of profound piece of art. Her selflessness and devotion to her family, and tortured sense of divided loyalites are presented so powerfully, and so plausibly, that the final scene in the car at the end (those who've seen it will recall immediately what I mean) pulls at your emotions so hard you'd swear it was you who was making the decision. I defy anyone with a pulse not to shed copious amounts of tears at this point --- you would have to have a heart of stone not to be moved on some level by this great, great performance.Clint Eastwood provides good, solid support in the sense that he doesn't overact, and allows Meryl to become the heart of the film. This is a wise decision - part of the terrible weakness of the book was its dependence upon the inane thoughts and ramblings of Robert Kincaid. The film is beautifully directed, beautifully photograhed and beautifully scored - the radio tunes and the non-diegetic Bridges Love theme really enhance the romantic, lush tone and mood of the film.My only problem is with the misguided decision to cast Francesca's older children and flash back periodically to them reading through their Mother's journals. The acting in these parts is mediocre at best, and they detract from the elegance and poignant mastery of Meryl Streep's central performance. The ashes scene at the end is - I feel - necessary for closure, but the rest of the scenes featuring the chldren should have been scrapped. The Francesca and Robert sections stand alone and require no interruption - these other segments cheapen the mastery of Meryl.Above all, this is a film which (on paper) can be dismissed as pure soap opera. But it transcends these potentially trite themes to make a universal story of love, selflessness, devotion and choice, that speaks eloquently to the viewer, no matter what your age or experience. It's a truly heartbreaking tale of transitory experience and the power of memory. It will make you think about your own life, and about your closest family members and relationships.And its finest quality has to be the magic of Meryl Streep who proves, yet again, why she is uniquely the best actress we have ever had. As Clint Eastwood said about casting this role 'I only made one phonecall'. He knew as you will too - no other actress could have brought so much depth, warmth, beauty, charisma and humanity to this character.

It's a truly heartbreaking tale of transitory experience and the power of memory. It will make you think about your own life, and about your closest family members and relationships.And its finest quality has to be the magic of Meryl Streep who proves, yet again, why she is uniquely the best actress we have ever had. As Clint Eastwood said about casting this role 'I only made one phonecall'. He knew as you will too - no other actress could have brought so much depth, warmth, beauty, charisma and humanity to this character. As a humble film lover, it's all I can do to applaud her from the depths of my heart. Bravo, Queen Meryl!   ","genre":"Drama, Romance"}]
