This is basically a modernization of the classic William Shakespeare play with the same title. Sounds like a.....good....idea? Well though it can definitely get pulled off BUT much like the modern day Romeo and Juliet the dialogue is identical to the play from 400 years ago. So there is old English and it doesn't fit at all with the modern day setting. It's incredibly distracting and unfitting. Modernizing all the dialogue not even a little bit just doesn't work and you better don't give me the business as a excuse to keep this movie timeless because it's already 15 years old and incredibly out of date. There are fax machines, VHS tapes, and hilarious early 2000s outfits scattered out throughout the movie, it already doesn't hold up.Unlike the Romeo and Juliet (96) which had a ton of stylized cinematography and pacing Hamlet 2000 is mundane, grey and not fun to look at. The setting is in some generic apartment building witch isn't visually stimulating. Though there is occasional creative shots here and there, they are far and few between. But to be honest Hamlet 2000 was pretty low budget and it shows its measly 2 million dollar budget in the lack of visuals and couldn't get close to the epic scale, beautiful shots, from the Oscar nominated Hamlet 1996Little skill was used in the directing as most scenes were people sitting around barely moving. Acting for the most part is wooden and unconvincing. Half the lines are barely audible and most people speak in mumble. I felt like the actors had no clue what they were saying. I barely knew what they were saying. The casting wasn't that good either, Ethan Hawke as Hamlet; Bill Murray as Polonius? What? That doesn't sound right and they just phoned in every scene. Julia Stiles's character Ofelia has a scene where she screams in fear comes off as unintentionally hilarious because it looked like she didn't care at all. One take seems like most they ever did and it makes the movies genre to be a Thriller to be underwhelming.The respect for the source material could be taken as offensive. The famous To Be or Not To Be speech is filmed in a blockbuster while Ethan Hawke has the goofiest outfit imaginable. Nice product placement there buddy! Then all of a sudden you see Hamlet 2000 watching the actual Hamlet on TV? Wh-what?! How does that even work? Just imagine if its Back to the Future 2 and in it the main characters are seen watching Back to the Future 1 on television. It shouldn't even be in the same universe. The play Hamlet puts on is changed to a pretentious The Ring like VHS tape though I kind of like that scene. Sound mixing is muffled a bit though it could've been the VHS copy I was watching. But there was barely any music in the movie when there was it was incredibly generic. There's a scene that takes place in a party and the characters are still mumbling to each other while blaring music is playing. How do they hear each other? This could be the fault of some mediocre editing which has some flashbacks or visions that don't really add to the film at all.This is one of the shorter Hamlet movies to get released just running less than 2 hours which is definitely useful if you wanted a quick summary of the story. And its not a horrible film its definitely watchable and its pretty innocent experiment. When it was released it was well received surprisingly reaching a 70\/100 on Metacritic it hasn't aged well however. Hamlet 2000 is still fun to poke at with a group of people. But still there are tons of other adaptions of Hamlet that should be checked out like the 1948 and 1996 ones.

However, when Victor Fries\/Mr Freeze teams up with Pamela Isley\/Poison Ivy to destroy Gotham City, they will need the help of not only each other, but also trusty butler Alfred and their new ally Batgirl to save the day. The plot of Batman and Robin is one of its biggest downfalls. The main plot involves Mr Freeze trying to steal enough diamonds to help save his wife Nora, whilst trying to plunge Gotham into a new ice age, and Poison Ivy enlisting the help of Bane to allow plants to take over the world. It's bizarre that the two characters work together since their motivations are completely contradictory, and the plot is so rushed due to exposition-filled dialogue that it's hard to pick up on their motivations. The plot is otherwise paper-thin, having no real drive aside from the villains and the aforementioned Alfred sub-plot, and ends up feeling like a series of clunky dialogue scenes leading up to the next dreadful action scene. However, I felt that the subplot involving Alfred's deteriorating health was one of my highlights of the film. It is the only time where I felt for the characters, and a few minor plot conveniences not withstanding, prevents the film from being completely awful. The characters are also very disappointing. Batman himself is wise- cracking, witty and light-hearted - or at least is supposed to be - but anyone that has ever read a contemporary Batman comic or seen Burton's previous films will know that Batman isn't like that - maybe in the 1960s, but not in the 1990s. Robin is forgettable and isn't half as charming as in the first film, and it's surprising that the film is called Batman and Robin, since the only time they are properly united and working together is at the very end. Mr Freeze, as many reviewers before me have remarked, is dreadful, and once again nothing like the comics. I don't mind a bit of deviation from the comics - Bane in The Dark Knight Rises worked for me - but when Mr. Freeze, an intellectually advanced scientist driven by passion, retorts cheesy ice-puns throughout the film, I have to put my foot down. Poison Ivy is closer to her comic- book origins, using her feminine allure to seduce her enemies into doing what she wants, but the portrayal of Bane here is simply awful. He was the man that broke the Bat, a feat very rarely achieved, but here is shown as a brainless brute, only good for smashing obstacles and brawling. It is clear that Schumacher has never read a Batman comic, or the representations of these characters wouldn't be so abysmal. Performances are on the whole terrible as well. Headliner Arnold Schwarzenegger is horrendous as Mr. Freeze, lacking any of the depth of previous villains of the franchise, and ends up being lifeless and solely there to vomit out poorly-written ice puns. He's never been famed for his acting chops, but here it is clear that he isn't even trying, and rightly deserves to be panned by critics. Uma Thurman's Poison Ivy is mostly the same, with a surprisingly one-dimensional performance when considering her standout film Pulp Fiction had only come out three years prior to this. George Clooney - while still being easily the worst Batman - is less terrible than the villains. He manages to handle himself quite well during the action scenes, and when playing Bruce Wayne, is actually quite decent. My standout performer however is Michael Gough as Alfred. He is one of only two actors to weather the entire quadrilogy, and gets the most screen-time in this installment than in previous ones, even with his own subplot. He is one of the few performers that you can tell is actually putting effort in, which I commend.From a technical standpoint, Batman and Robin is just as appalling as everywhere else. Joel Schumacher's direction is worse than in Batman Forever by quite some distance, with even more of those godforsaken crotch shots and grappling hook shots than before. There is clearly not a morsel of innovation or effort here, and it makes the film even lazier than it already was. The score is one of the better elements of Batman and Robin, and although not a patch on Danny Elfman's original score, manage to drag this film ever so little from the festering pit it dug itself into. The design of Gotham has been completely altered, even from Batman Forever, and now consists of mostly neon, nothing like the Gothic city that has been shown previously, and it is really disappointing that the franchise was taken in this direction. The fight scenes are also poorly directed, rarely keeping up with the action, and it is clear that they take place mostly indoors to allow play-sets to be produced and sold.The best word to describe Batman and Robin is 'lazy'. It is lazily written, with a terrible and convoluted story, lazily acted, with the film's highest-paid stars clearly not even coming close to trying, and lazily made, with a director that clearly doesn't care for the source material or fans of the previous, far superior, films.

The opening to this in the car graveyard, which is the only scene outside the house, is the perfect start here with the crazy deaths showing cars being thrown around quite easily and really gets the freaky moments to add in with a fantastic sequence while getting the action in the house really nicely. The chases through the hallways are quite fun by letting the different ghosts and their gruesome looks which makes the scenes all the more fun. There's a large amount of the confrontations as well that provide not only the creepiness needed here while also making it thrilling as confrontations around the bathroom, around a pane of glass set-up as a barrier in the hallway and gong through their containment chambers in the basement are all incredibly enjoyable here. These fun attacks manage to bring about plenty of fun gore as well with plenty of gruesome, bloody deaths that go alongside the rather gruesome ghosts for a great time here, and along with the explosive action of the finale house destruction for all the great positives in this one. There's really only one flaw here for this one which is the fact that there's way too many important parts of the storyline introduced far too late into this one to get their full effect.

It's certainly not a perfect movie and it has many flaws, the first hour of the movie barely has a story, and they're clearly trying their best to cram in a bit of a storyline in the last half hour, also some jokes were repeated much too often and others went further than necessary. The cast are certainly the movies highlight and if it wasn't for the fact that they all were clearly having a great time filming this and seemed interested, this movie would have been terrible, obviously the most praise must go to Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan, but there are also some very funny and memorable performances from the likes of Richard Grieco, Dan Hedaya, Loni Anderson, Meredith Scott Lynn and, one of my favourite characters in this film, Lochlyn Munro. It's definitely not perfect, but if you find the two leads as likable as I do then you're sure to enjoy A Night at the Roxbury, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy.

The 400 Blows against the classical Hollywood film clichés (in a good way), and it's episodic and somewhat documentary-like cinematic techniques help to create the authentic story of a 14-year-old boy. The protagonist Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Leaud) is viewed as a trouble-making teenager among the adults. Actually, Antoine lives an unhappy life dealing with his verbally abusive mother who is having an affair with a man from work, and his kind and friendly yet not deeply attachable stepfather whom he initially considered as his biological father. His departed grandfather is the only inspiration in his life. His luck is not good. At his school, Antoine has to deal with an uninspired teacher who always doubt his talent and pictures him as nothing but as a troublemaker. To make a matter worst, he skips school, and lies to his parents and teacher. Receiving unprofessional reputation from his school teacher, and all the negligence from his parents force him to get the statuses of a liar, a dropout, and a theft which eventually lead him to the juvenile detention home. Delinquency is the key theme in this film. Antoine believes in freedom, and he is constantly planning to escape from being locked up. Using real locations in Paris, and having unprofessional actors with some improvised dialogues define the cinematic reality in this film. It is realistic, yet it has a moving story in which Truffaut skillfully plays around with the camera to add colors to this black and white film; extremely long shots in Antoine's' running scenes, a high aerial shot of the boy jogging scene, and a series of close-ups and deep focus shots will draw the audiences in the middle of actions as well as into the main characters' mind.
