Audrey Hepburn had become a sensational star the previous year with Roman Holiday and she is the charm and light of this one. There is a slight echo of the earlier movie, in reverse--she is now the poor girl who is mistaken (at times) for being cultured and rich, and throughout there are the slight, American versions of class structure being broken down. Mostly though, this is about a girl in love, but mostly in love with being in love, and it doesn't totally matter to whom. Certainly the one she thinks is so wonderful is not, though he's charming in the likable way that William Holden, probably a cad himself, is so good at. Playing his older brother in the film (forget family resemblance here) is Humphrey Bogart, a nice, somber guy completely caught up in being a successful businessman. And so there is a natural set up for conflicts and jealousies, and confusion. It's not quite a classic screwball comedy, though it's funny in a warm way all the way through. The seriousness that Hepburn brings to her role is less crazy and more charming and delightful. And romantic. We need her to be dreamy, and she comes through. Once the end approaches, we really don't care too much what happens as long as she is happy, and we are content enough it works out the way it does for the two brothers, with a small twist or two right up to the end. I do quaff slightly at Hepburn being even remotely interested in the Bogart character, so obviously three times her age and dull as a brick (he is no Rick here). I suppose it fits every older man's desire (in the audience) to think they might actually be attractive to someone so young and obviously pretty. This gets pulled off more convincingly in Hepburn's next major film, where Cary Grant did after all pull if off, Charade, if only because Cary Grant is Cary Grant. But I know, we are supposed to close our eyes to logic in nutty comedies, and the rest of the set-up manages to stay intact here on Long Island, 1954. Bogart certainly is a model of kindness and patience, and we can see a young woman wanting that in her man, whatever their ages. A highlight for me Hepburn sings La Vie en Rose, the Piaf hit, while they drive in the car. Twice. Makes you want to go to Paris.Bogart was apparently such a nasty presence during the shooting (partly because he was a replacement for, yes, Cary Grant, who backed out), he later apologized to Wilder. And Hepburn's gowns (which are part of the plot as well as the usual necessity) are not by Edith Head (who won and accepted an Oscar for them) but by Givenchy, who continued a long association with Hepburn. The 1995 remake? Well, the plot line is intact, and you might prefer the new style of acting and filming, but for me this old one has just a perfect balance of love and lunacy, with great writing and a wonderful awkward central cast. I mean, a somber Bogart and zany Holden vying for the ever delicate and slightly clueless Audrey Hepburn? Who would have thought that would work? It does.

It was an adapted screenplay (by Robert Riskin), from the short story Night Bus and was directed by Frank Capra. With a simple story, plot, modest budget and a very short four week production schedule, this film goes a long way. Director Frank Capra obviously knew the story to tell and how to tell it. Some of the best films are made in a surprisingly short amount of time and on a modest budget. This film followed what Capra hoped would be a critical and box office success. The hopes were low for this film, even after securing stars Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert for the lead roles. Columbia Studios was not well respected at the time in Hollywood.It Happened One Night, 1934, had a relatively small budget for it's time $325,000, of which Claudette Colbert asked for and received $50,000 for her role. A star receiving this much of the total film budget was unheard of during the 1930's. Released during America's Great Economic Depression, the film had excellent timing and proved to be a big critical and audience hit. All the right elements came together. It had a high quality comedic screenplay with believable characters in believable situations. A film where luck and chemistry came together, producing a film that exceeded the expectations of everyone involved, including its' director Frank Capra.The film comes across as light hearted and natural and with excellent timing and pacing. For it's time, this style of film was new. It would be one of the first of a new genre screwball romantic comedy. Winner of five Academy Awards in all the major categories Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Actor in a Leading Role and Actress in a Leading Role, was a first in Hollywood history. Only two other films have swept the five top Academy Awards One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, 1975 and The Silence of the Lambs, 1991.Claudette Colbert was quoted as saying I just finished the worst film ever on It Happened One Night. She had no idea how well the film would be edited. The film editing here is subtle and sublime. Colbert and Gable achieved that rare and special screen chemistry in the film. Colbert's demand that the film needed to be produced in four weeks, because of her vacation schedule, actually created the lively pace of the film, working in it's favor. It Happened One Night is a fine example of a quality screenplay, some good luck and a lot of chemistry, all coming together, producing an enduring and enjoyable comedy classic.Clark Gable comes across as completely natural and very entertaining. The fun had while making this film shows partly in Gable's performance. Unfortunately, he would not be cast in a comedic role again, even after the big success of this film. The studio system of the time demanded stars remain type-casted. For Gable, that meant macho romantic leading action man.To me, It Happened One Night is the best ever romantic comedy film, a gold standard for it's genre. It's lost none of it's charm and naturalness since it's release in 1934. The look of the film dates it, but it still delivers it's original naturalness, charm, wittiness, timing, pacing and entertainment value. Just about a perfectly made film.

The sequel is outrageous, campy and absurd, but all that is completely acceptable because sequels are supposed to be like that. When the element of surprise is gone and the plot is as predictable as the weather forecast in Siberia, what else are you supposed to show except grotesque madness and nonsensical horror goodness?

The story logically continues where The Stepfather ended, only you'll have relish with some far-fetched things that may come across as unreal. Shortly after his initial murder spree, Jerry Blake is alive, kicking and institutionalized. Not only did he survive that stabbing at the end of the original, he only has the tiniest little scar on his chest even though I clearly remember that the blade of the knife was planted in his body for at least three quarters! His escape from the mental asylum is even more implausible, as the stupidest psychiatrist imaginable pretty much breaks all the safety rules ever written and literally begs to be massacred.

And the movie will grab hold of you right from the beginning and not let go before the very end.The characters in the movie are good and enjoyable, each of the three lead roles were well played.

This is a terrible film and this was obvious by the first scene. The film begins with three very white-bread kids being taught by their grandfather how to be ninjas in some sort of Mario Brothers-like training facility. Considering how similar all this looks to Pocket Ninjas (the #4 lowest ranked film on IMDb's Bottom 100 list), I knew I was in for a painful time! Soon after leaving grandpa's house, the three annoying brats go with their friends to an amusement park that is about to be taken over by the lamest villains in history--Loni Anderson and Jim Varney as 'Medusa' and 'Lothar'!! And, oh God say it isn't so, it's up to the thee kids AND Hulk Hogan to save the day. Can it get any worse?!?! Well, with tons of lame stunts, tons of special effects and minimal acting, the answer is YES! To show the FBI that they mean business, once the baddies take over the park, they make certain rides go SLIGHTLY faster!!! What beasts!! In fact, while there is lots of punching and kicking, this is only family-friendly violence--so the kids naturally win and no one shoots, stabs or even tickles their opponents. Because of this and the constantly insipid writing, the film is a total bore to anyone older than about 6.So should this movie be on the infamous Bottom 100 list? I think probably not for two reasons. First, very, very young kids will enjoy this insipid crap--and to me, a film should not be on the list if it is in any way enjoyable. Second, the production values are not that terrible and the film makes no attempt to be anything more than it is--a dopey little film that would most likely make a parent kill themselves or the kids if they are forced to watch it!!

Edging on the historical, but focusing mainly on a squabble of young love, the muddled themes of originality, independence, and sexual revolution seemed to take backstage for overacting, choppy editing, and a twisty story that begs for more but desires nothing. In the Oscar world of The Godfather vs. Cabaret, the obvious winner is Coppola's film &#x96; but how did Cabaret even get in the running? As it took me nearly three viewings to conquer this behemoth, one has to question the 1972 value, and whether this musical stands up next to the others nearly 40 years later. In this reviewer's opinion, it is an obvious no, but arguments will apparently follow.If discussing this film around the cinematic water cooler, there would be no doubt Joel Grey would be discussed. His portrayal, as small as it was, as the infamous Master of Ceremonies has yet to be repeated in any film to date. In various moments Cabaret felt like it was directed by Terry Gilliam, complete with the flash and darkness subsequent in his features. Joel Grey brought it to the table, and will forever be a frightening, yet influential image in my mind. He made the nearly 2-hours redeemable. The excitement in his swagger coupled with his level of pizazz completely overshadowed his co-star Minnelli whenever the two shared the screen. His performance alone, the transformation itself, is what made Cabaret worth a view. It was he and Minnelli's duet of Money Makes the World Go Round that saved this film from utter obliteration. It was reminiscent of a modern day Moulin Rouge, but it was the surrounding story &#x96; without surrounding characters &#x96; that caused the pain known as Cabaret. One must also applaud Bob Fosse for his direction, for without him, these dark scene filmed with Grey would have just been as bland as the story. Fosse took this flimsy story of three characters that we are emotionally void for, and pulled in some great song and dance numbers to buffer the pain that was sure to follow. His work on Lenny was outstanding, and while this didn't speak as greatly, you could see his influences on the script and final edit.To bookend the positive, one must also ask Where did 'Cabaret' fail? Without wasting pages of words, Cabaret failed because of the sloppy editing, the poorly developed historical slant, and due to the massive disappointment from the actors. This could have been a memorable song-and-dance rooted with historical symbolism-esquire film, but instead fell flat thanks mainly to the horrible nature of Liza Minnelli. Her flat voice matched well with her disassociated character, which carried no emotion, flaunted no values, yet tried to win our heart. She sang decently, but I just couldn't stand behind her as a central focus. Her entire relationship with Michael York is flippant. Does she love him? Does she love money? What is her true background? What does she want from life? Mix these unanswered questions with the uncomfortable hint of sexuality between York and Minnelli, and you have nearly 90% of this movie. From Minnelli's undefined character, to the passive aggressive York duel-jobbing as both language educator and African safari supporter, there just isn't a character you can stand behind. As we get close to the middle of the film, our writer seems to realize this and the extremely vague Maximilian is introduced as a man who enjoys the company of both Minnelli and York. For Cabaret to work, there needed stronger characters for us to follow &#x96; ones that were defined, yet complex, not just jumping from emotion to emotion. How did Minnelli win an Oscar for this mess? Outside the of intermittent use of Grey, our writer - Jay Presson Allen &#x96; tried to incorporate what was happening in Germany at the time with the Nazi movement, with the chaos of a cabaret show. In theory, this would be a great idea &#x96; but it failed because of again, the lack of focus with our characters. In one scene we are troubled by York's disagreement with one of Minnelli's haphazard choices (a big decision that was diminished by choice) and in the next, we are dissecting the idea of a German Jew. It just didn't flow well together. In another scene, we are forced to listen to a young Nazi soldier sing a ballad that evokes singing from everyone &#x96; and our characters just drive away. For me, to best summarize this film would be one of the final scenes between York and Minnelli as she takes him to the train station. She leaves by merely waving her hand, demonstrating her care for the characters and ours as well. When this film was over, I took it out of my player, walked away waving unemotionally. Cabaret failed because there was nothing for the audience to hold onto. When the breakout actor was someone that didn't speak but merely sang that should speak about how the film as a whole turned out.Overall, both with presentation and delivery, Cabaret failed. Minnelli's acting and eyes told a different story, and portrayed a character that just didn't fit for a feature film. What was attempted as original just felt stale after the first several scenes. Fosse's direction and Grey's performance are the only two saving qualities of this film, as the flakey York does his best as a love interest. The dual sexual roles are just too abashing for both the actors and the viewers. I was eager to witness this film, but nearly 40 years later, this film has not held up.

He introduced himself as a 'song and dance man'. A truly multi-faceted performer who was loved and hated at the same time by people in his prime, he also was an inter-gender wrestling champion. Famous for his on stage set-ups, pranks and creation of fictitious characters, he evolved from a club performer to a man watched by 40 million people worldwide. This movie tries to shed some light on the personal ups and downs of Kauffman and the effects of his public life on his shaping up as a human. Even a premature death due to lung cancer did not mellow down the aura this man had. Man on the Moon looks at Kauffman's life as a chapter - Starting from childhood, to his prime days and ends with a question lingering in the minds of the viewer.On the acting front, Jim Carrey lives the character of Kauffman. People will agree with me that no other actor could have given this movie and character the justice that Carrey gave. Danny Devito in his supporting act is great. There are innumerable characters in the movie (Some people playing themselves such as David Letterman, Jerry Lawler etc), But the power of Carrey's performance is such that we only remember him throughout and after the movie. Why not an Oscar Nomination for Carrey I ask? The movie has it's happy and sad moments which will leave a smile on the face or a tear in the eye of the viewer. I personally had goosebumps while watching some scenes namely 1) The Christmas Act of Kauffman and appearance of Santa Claus . 2) The Philliphines Miracle healing hoax and the reaction of Carrey. 3) The Final Scene which I will not mention here.Overall, surely one of the best biographical movies I have seen ever.

He gets a lot of one liners (many of which he probably improvised) but he doesn't deliver them very well. Because Seagal can take out any number of bad guys regardless of the time and place, there is really no conflict in a movie like Fire Down Below and ergo, no sense of even a moments tension. This is why the movie is neither thrilling nor riveting or any synonym, it is just amusing, at least it is enough so to make it worth watching if there is nothing else on.Seagal is Jack Taggart a fed (and a carpenter) who is sent out into the Kentucky hills to investigate the possible dumping of toxic waste by a crooked mining corporation. Because the locals are getting payed off, they don't really want Taggart around. Can he persuade them to make a stand or is he gonna have to bring down the big money single handedly.I can't say the fight scenes are very inventive or elaborate but the sound mix is surprisingly effective. Even though it is comprised mostly of stock sounds, it delivers a punch, especially in one sequence which is taken right out of Duel where a diesel truck goes over a cliff. Seagal's guitar in the background is nice every now and then, but the soundtrack otherwise is badly mixed. Steven Seagal movies are dumb, but they can also be fun. I suppose this could have been worse, but it is one of the Seagal films that I'd recommend.

Lambasted on release by regarded critics and chided by many a cinema goer who went in expecting Mask & Ace Ventura like fluff, The Cable Guy was thought to be the death knell for Carrey's career. It wasn't of course. He would revert to pleasing box office friendly type the following year with Liar Liar, and would continue to surprise with his choice of roles, and the performances with them, in the likes of The Truman Show, Man On The Moon & Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. As a point of reference with his career overview, The Cable Guy stands up as a bold choice by Carrey, and one that serves notice of his willingness, and ability, to take on more challenging roles.The film itself is a mixture of high Carrey comedy mixed with dark, almost horror, undertones. It's thematics of loneliness and the need for companionship makes for an odd bedfellow with the berserker antics of Carrey as he plays off Matthew Broderick's ordinary Joe. Yet director Ben Stiller, the cop out finale aside, has achieved the cheeky fusion with much success. Utilising Carrey's energy as both a force of comic nature, and a bubbling under the surface desperado loony tune. Along the way, well before it goes real dark and gets edgy, we are treated to some delightful comedy moments.

Indeed, Whales had just already made Frankenstein, and there are some light echoes from that first film here--a scientist doing experiments that are not sane, a fiancée worried about his being away so long, and the townspeople gathering their bumbling wits together to get the creature.The creature in this case is just a man, but his invisibility is his invincibility, and he goes on a reign of terror both funny (things fly and men and kicked in the behind) and terrible (lots of murder). Unlike Frankenstein, there is no greater pathos at work. We never really feel anything for the invisible man, played by Claude Rains (in a role that kicked off his career, which must have struck everyone with some irony, since we never really see him). The plot, and the reactions of all the characters from friends to scores of policemen, is simply how to get this guy, how to make him visible enough to see.The effects are justly famous. The pace is fast, the acting good if a little campy at times, and the dilemma, without overtones, is still great fun, even almost eighty years later.

The pace is fast, the acting good if a little campy at times, and the dilemma, without overtones, is still great fun, even almost eighty years later.

Wells, who wrote the book for this story in 1893, but director James Whale makes it a fast, chilling, and comical romp. I can see why Wells didn't particularly like it, but it has lost any literary pretensions and fits into the Universal horror film era that was rocketing the studio to success. Indeed, Whales had just already made Frankenstein, and there are some light echoes from that first film here--a scientist doing experiments that are not sane, a fiancée worried about his being away so long, and the townspeople gathering their bumbling wits together to get the creature.The creature in this case is just a man, but his invisibility is his invincibility, and he goes on a reign of terror both funny (things fly and men and kicked in the behind) and terrible (lots of murder). Unlike Frankenstein, there is no greater pathos at work. We never really feel anything for the invisible man, played by Claude Rains (in a role that kicked off his career, which must have struck everyone with some irony, since we never really see him).
