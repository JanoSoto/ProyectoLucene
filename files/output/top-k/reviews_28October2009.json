This, his last film, is both cute and clever and a tiny bit suspenseful. It reuses some of the same kinds of tricks we've seen from him before, with a twist here or there the innocent protagonists, for example, are themselves up to a little bit of a scam. And in Hitchcock fashion, the antagonists, a parallel couple, are lighthearted in their murderousness. Their angst over crime is theatrical.There are usually moments in his movies that are vividly disturbing, and he contrasts these with either lightly comic scenes, downright silliness, or charming, everyday life. Think of the family in Shadow of a Doubt or Cary Grant in North by Northwest for starters. In this movie, beginning even with the pun of the title (the family plot is a cemetery plot), everything is chipper. The hair-raising runaway car scene is so scary and absurdly silly at the same time I think a lot of people will give up on the movie as just plain stupid. Part of me agrees, but I laughed out loud through the whole scene in appreciation, and not because of comic timing or original sight gags or whatnot, but because I could imagine the director laughing. Movies are supposed to entertain, he would insist (supposedly saying to the impassioned Ingrid Bergman once, Ingrid, it's just a movie.) Hitchcock wants it to be carefully silly and disarming at the same time. I mean, he's winking at us just as we are supposed to be scared.The evil-doers are really not very evil here, though the man does propose some pretty ruthless behavior, and the people out to do good (eventually, anyway, with dollar signs in their eyes all the same) are truly fun and natural as a couple. The plots of the two couples are separate at first, and once they join it gets complicated but never confusing. The Mustang is already eleven years old for this film--a sign of how far into our current era Hitchcock has come, and perhaps a reminder that his style of making movies is starting to look like just that, a style, something artificial and quaint when hard edged, elegant realism has stormed back into Hollywood (from Chinatown to the Godfather to, in 1976, uh, Rocky). If Hitch is out of touch with the times, he's completely in touch with his own approach. This is a Hitchcock film, through and through, and if you are tired of me saying that, it's because I think you might hate it without knowing how much it depends on knowing, liking, and understanding that kind of movie. It's totally enjoyable. Not his best, but enjoyable and well made and almost heartwarming, of all things.

The setting is the obligatory open prairie. The music swells in all the appropriate places, and the characters do what needs to be done. The pacing skips back and forth between serious scenes where people are brutalized and then humorous scenes that, to me, got in the way.There are also some very ingenious scenes. The scene leading up to the attack where the Comanche wipe out Wayne's family is foreboding in every way. The colors of the sky just look evil and without saying much at all, the characters demonstrate the sense of doom and dread they are feeling. The director here is John Ford, of course, and he uses all of the tricks that made him famous in the 1930s. Guess what? They still work in the 1950s and in the 2000s. Sometimes I think we were better off without all the special effects. Ford does certain things very well. 1. Landscape shots--There is nothing more beautiful than a Ford landscape complete with a fade from scene to scene. 2. Economy shots--Ford uses the camera well and uses one shot\/take to do many things at once. At the beginning, he introduces all of the characters in just 3 takes. And few words are used. The woman Martha, Wayne's sister-in-law in this film, walks out of the house and watches Wayne approach. Then we see the rest of the family emerge onto the porch. Lastly, they all walk into the house. The only words spoken are Ethan?, That's your Uncle Ethan, and Welcome home, Ethan. Yet we know several things Ethan (Wayne) and Martha love one another romantically, Ethan has been gone for a long time, the kids are glad to see him, and the brother isn't sure how he feels. Ford does this all with his actors' faces. It's marvelous.The basics of the plots are that Ethan comes home 3 years after the surrender of the Confederates to the Yankees. He plans to stay with his family until he can set up a place of his own. Then a tribe of Comanche Indians brutally burns his brother's house and kills the couple and possibly the son. The tribe also kidnaps both girls, one a teenager and the other about 8 years old. Ethan is determined to hunt down the tribe that killed his family and rescue the little girl. He is accompanied by his adopted nephew, a boy he doesn't trust because he is partially Cherokee and Ethan is a racist through and through. They search for the little girl FOR NINE YEARS.

If you've seen one version of the novel then you've pretty much seen all of them as each film takes away and adds their own interpretation of the novel. I won't argue how faithful or non-faithful this film is but there's no denying the power it has and the fact that it's one of the greatest adaptations out there and might only be surpassed by the equally masterful remake from Werner Herzog and Klaus Kinski. I think what works so well here is that Murnau pays so much attention to every little detail that every single frame of this movie has something interesting to look at. There isn't a single shot in this film that doesn't appear to have taken hours to set up because of either the lighting, the angle or just how many interesting things there are to see. Check out the sequence where Hutter looks down from his window to see the coffins being packed up. While watching the film you'll notice the coffins and all the work being done but on repeat viewings actually look at everything else going on around it. The same can be said for the shot of Orlok rising out of his coffin, which is perhaps one of the greatest single shots in film history. There's so much going on in this scene that you could look away from the actual rising and still feel the rich, eerie atmosphere that's running on overdrive. The performance by Schreck certainly lives up to everything ever written and his look is a work of art. The pointed ears and those fingers makes for one of the best creations ever to grace the screen. The entire sequence aboard the ship is also one of the most haunting as we get countless great moments from the dirt being revealed from the coffin, to Orlok's rising and then the scene with the ill men. I think the film's one weakness is that it starts off a tad bit slow but it quickly picks up and keeps getting better as it moves along to the wonderful ending. There have been hundreds of other vampire movies to come along since this one but it's really hard to think of any that's better. The remake from Herzog might surpass this but either way, this is a true legend of cinema that deserves its reputation.

It is beautifully filmed, with lush cinematography and lovely scenery. And I liked the music as well. The direction is pretty solid, and there are some very poignant moments. The performances are not at all bad, Haley Joel Osment undoubtedly gives the strongest one of the lot, while looking extremely cute he does convince in the delivery of his lines and in his face. Gerard Depardieu gives a very pleasant and whimsical characterisation as the imaginary friend, however if his character was perhaps more complex he would've been more memorable. Whoopi Goldberg gives her usual standard of performance, a woman with attitude, yet with a soft side to her, and that is exactly what her character Harriet is like. However, the film while nicely performed and meaning well, is weighed down by an uninvolving story and a sometimes weak script.

While sometimes univolving in terms of story, this fantasy film about a young lonely orphaned boy befriending a seemingly-imaginary man never fails to be pleasant and charming. It is beautifully filmed, with lush cinematography and lovely scenery. And I liked the music as well. The direction is pretty solid, and there are some very poignant moments. The performances are not at all bad, Haley Joel Osment undoubtedly gives the strongest one of the lot, while looking extremely cute he does convince in the delivery of his lines and in his face. Gerard Depardieu gives a very pleasant and whimsical characterisation as the imaginary friend, however if his character was perhaps more complex he would've been more memorable.

The film is centered on four friends who pool their money so that one of them can enter a high-stakes back-room poker game. Eddie (Nick Moran), a natural at reading the most minute involuntary reactions, is convinced he can't lose. The game has been rigged against him, however, and what looked like a sure thing ends with Eddie and his friends in debt to a local crime boss and purveyor of pornography named Hatchet Harry. Now these three petty criminals (and one aspiring chef named Soap who's always managed to keep his hands clean) have one week to come up with £500,000 or Harry's enforcer will start taking their fingers. This is writer and director Guy Ritchie's first time at the helm of a feature film, but he expertly guides us through a labyrinth of schemes and characters without the viewer becoming lost in the details. And there is a lot going on in this movie. Multiple interconnected plots dance around each other as thugs, street-corner jewelry hucksters, drug dealers, and crime lords all scheme against one-another. Ritchie makes excellent use of the camera and of music. When Eddie staggers away from the poker game finding himself impossibly deep in debt to a very dangerous man, the scene takes on a surreal yet panicked mood that puts the viewer right in the character's shoes. Looking directly into his face as he makes his way out, you're drawn in and feel his world crashing down around your own shoulders. The slick soundtrack of blues and rock adds to the effect of immersion, setting a rhythm for the action on screen. The cast members turn in strong performances all around. Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels marks the feature film debuts of Jason Statham and Vinnie Jones, both of whom would go on to become well-known actors in the genre. Sting also turns in a memorable cameo appearance as Eddie's father. There is a fair bit of violence and quite a lot of foul language. While it doesn't descend into being vulgar simply for shock value, there is more than sensitive viewers are likely to be able to overlook.

It's not a movie you hear a lot about, as it probably got lost among the plethora of post-Godfather mob films. However, it's well above average for the cast and characterizations.Pistone risks everything to get in with the mob, attaching himself to Lefty (Al Pacino). Lefty isn't a big boss - he's a middleman, the one who takes all the risks and continually is passed over for promotion. He takes Donnie under his wing, teaches him the lingo, how to dress, etc. All the while, Donnie is meeting his FBI boss for coffee and passing him information. As Donnie gets in deeper and deeper, his harried wife (Anne Heche), who rarely sees him, becomes disgusted. He is constantly disappointing his children. Soon he begins to identify with the mob, even speaking like them, more than he identifies with the FBI. And he realizes that once he comes out of the mob, Lefty, who brought him in and with whom he has a bond, will be murdered.Pacino and Depp are extraordinary together and give fantastic performances. Pacino isn't the powerful don as Michael Corleone was; he's a worker bee who takes orders. One feels sorry for where his life has gone. Depp's Joe is badly treated by the FBI - his frustration, anger, and confusion over his own feelings are apparent. They both elevate this film.Anne Heche does a terrific job as Joe's unhappy wife, who adores him nevertheless, and Michael Madsen is great as a big boss with more temper than brains.Mike Newell directs Donnie Brasco well, showing us the mean, depressing streets of New York, and the violence and stress of mob life, where your best friend can be the one who takes you out.

So many films have referenced Frankenstein that many of its more powerful elements may be lost on viewers discovering it for the first time today, but age has not diluted this classy production, or dulled the most potent of its indelible visuals.Universal's earliest monster outings were constructed much like the dramatic and noir flagstones that propelled the studio into greatness. In essence, they were Gothic stage plays captured on film, using strong acting and atmospherics to stimulate terror where the primitive special effects capabilities of the era could not. Frankenstein is crafted with this same approach, and one of the reasons it has aged so well is because it was developed with a sense of timelessness that befits the timeless nature of the source material.The locations, all made to order on Universal's sprawling backlot, are utterly believable and realistic, and basing most of the film in tucked-away parts of ancient European countrysides benefits the graceful aging of the film, since there are many parts of the world that still look just like the settings we see here.The massive castle sets, particularly Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory, are still impressive by modern standards, and though we now have more sophisticated toys than those seen in the lab, the devices in the doctor's dwelling are far more than elaborate set decoration. Each apparatus looks functional and logical, and though most of us have never tried to re-animate a corpse in our basement, we have to concede that the machines we'd need to do so would probably look and work just like the ones we see humming in the house of Frankenstein.Surely, no one reading this has managed to go their whole lives without seeing the iconic image of Boris Karloff's amazingly realized monster. But seeing him in action is another matter altogether, and even stifled under the unforgettable make-up, Karloff gives a brilliant performance as the tragic and misunderstood creature struggling to comprehend its existence after being spurned by its creator. The range of emotions Karloff conveys is astounding, especially considering that he doesn't have a single line in the film, and we surely empathize with the horrid reality of this damned creation as it uncovers each curse brought on by its unnatural birth. The make-up remains truly stunning, and the first time Frankenstein's monster steps into frame is still one of the most powerful and haunting images to ever grace a horror film.Ditto with the controversial drowning scene, which was edited from the film at various points of its history. Those seeing this sequence for the first time may be surprised that such a brief display was deemed so controversial in its day, but the stark simplicity of the image, and the horror that is implied rather than shown, shape an unforgettable scene that is crucial in driving the film to its climax. When the drowned girl's father later carries her limp and battered body down the street, the mourning and furious emptiness in his eyes is one of the film's most compelling images, as it perhaps most completely essays the outrageous evil of Dr. Frankenstein's horrific work.Those not used to classic movies may have trouble acclimating to the film's style, but the rewards of Frankenstein far outweigh any discomfort of adjustment, and there are a multitude of reasons this cinematic landmark has endured the way it has. For anyone who has yet to discover those reasons for themselves, consider your horror acumen woefully malnourished until you've added this certified classic to your library.

She looks like a '30s Eva Green with her lean, angular body and deep, flashing eyes; playing her scenes with a subtle coyness that hints both at the sexual abandon of Europe after the Great War and the nature of being a woman in what was then still decidedly a man's world.Have you ever seen a stenographer in a decent frock? she asks the baron.I have indeed, he says, eyeing her.One she bought herself?Grand Hotel plays with libertine notions here and there, but doesn't really declare itself as much more than a costume drama and an event picture where the stars gathering together IS the story as much as any plot point. Director Edmund Goulding presents some magnificent mise-en-scene tracking shots of the hotel lobby, one single take from behind the front desk until Joan Crawford's first entrance runs over four minutes and moves effortlessly from character to character.But the static quality of the overall vision becomes stifling before long; people coming, people going; people expressing their unhappiness in their gilded cage. By the end of the movie I was feeling a bit cooped up, too.

There is always something happening, sometimes subtle and sometimes right in your face but entertaining all the way. The dialogues made me laugh out loud and another huge plus is the first rate cast that further includes a host of talents like Joan Cusack, Jeremy Piven, Dan Akroyd and Hank Azaria. Even Minnie Driver does a fine job and there is a hilarious cameo by Jenny Elfman. I have often wondered what it would be like if John Cusack and Joan Cusack worked together and I thoroughly enjoyed their scenes. In addition there are two funny scenes where John Cusack features with his two other sibling. The entire cast seem to have had a blast during the making and their positive energy must have rubbed off on screen because the acting appears very spontaneous and natural.

Those wanting to explore a new genre or trying to find out why Allen is hailed as a genius filmmaker shouldn't miss Annie Hall either. Annie Hall is set in New York and Los Angeles in the mid-70s. The story is about Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) and Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). The relationship between the two protagonists is the crux of the movie. In between, we are given snippets of their lives before they met each other. Alvy Singer, a comedian, with two divorces runs into Annie Hall, a budding actress-singer, during a friendly game of tennis. They start dating and have a passionate affair, only to find out later that they have little in common. An amiable split, getting back together, being friends, trying to get back together; theirs is a see-saw relationship of two neurotic characters clashing with one another. In true Woody Allen fashion, the characters are far from normal. Alvy Singer is perpetually nervous (a trait he attributes to growing up under a roller-coaster), while Annie Hall needs to smoke grass to enjoy sex. Throughout the film, Woody Allen, through his character, talks to us, the audience, and on a couple of occasions brings in someone else from the plot to talk to us as well. The central genre of the movie is comedy. With Woody Allen at its helm, one can expect goofy sequences and numerous one-liners. Woody Allen's comic one-liners have achieved cult status and here are a few one-liners from the film Annie Hall saying, I can't have sex tonight. I'm singing tomorrow and need to rest my voice. Alvy Singer saying, Don't knock masturbation, its sex with someone I really love. And, Sex is the most fun I've had without laughing. And, on Beverly Hills being clean, They don't throw their garbage away, they make it into TV shows. And that's just a sampler.Annie Hall was released in 1977 and is one of Allen's most loved and appreciated movie. At the 1977 Oscars, it won numerous awards like Best Picture, Best Actress in a Leading Role, Best Director and Best Screenplay. Woody Allen was also nominated for the Best Actor award.

The backdrop of La Fronde as the French civil war was known, is difficult to explain. There were no good or bad guys. The country was thrown into confusion and disarray.The challenge of adapting the second Dumas novel (as well as the third) is that there is no clear cut plot element to hang your hat on. Unlike the race to get the jewels back from the first novel, Twenty Years Later is rather episodic and dis-jointed. the musketeers are no longer musketeers and (in the novel) they are not even on the same side of the political fence.The movie tries. There is an attempt at the levity of the previous two films. The screenwriters attempt to throw in a weird romance between Athos' son Raoul and Lady De Winter's daughter (an evil son in the book). The writers also keep many of the major set pieces from the book (the fire ship plot against the heroes, the execution of Charles I, the escape of the prince of Condé, etc.) but in the end the film has no spirit.Everyone involved must have dearly wanted to recapture the magic of the first two films. Lester was working under pressure on a television schedule and budget.In his autobiography Michael York describes how he looked forward to the first day of shooting.
