This movie comes along near the end of the Oscar year, and of course, will have buzz surrounding it until and after the nominees are announced. The reason, if not because of a genuinely enjoyable film, is because of its strikingly original screenplay. 1999 Has undoubtably been a great year in moviemaking, and along with titles like Being John Malkovich, and American Beauty, this movie is definitely going to top critics' lists.Watching this movie reminded me of P.T. Anderson's most notable work to date, Boogie Nights, in lots of ways. The most obvious to me, while maybe not so to many others, is the incredibly long steadycam shot during the first quiz show scene. The camera follows (typically from behind) lots of different characters, as though the audience is strolling through the halls of the studio. Like the opening of Boogie Nights, this is just simple exposition, but is really slick and comfortable. And on aside from the actors (the cast is basically the same as Boogie Nights), the long, slightly relentless shots of high emotion are everywhere (Jack & Earl for example), and while being almost too long (my attention almost drifts), the shots do make the viewer uncomfortable.The story (or stories) throughout this movie left me impressed, as although they all aren't connected, I found myself interested in all of them. Each time the focus shifted from one subplot to another, I found myself thinking 'o ya. I wanted to find out what was happening here'. Some might complain that so many stories lead to the 'tedious' three hour length, but I didn't even notice the length, because I found myself always interested in coming back to a story that was left hanging a few minutes prior.The ending of Magnolia will be forever talked about as being completely unique, and without giving too much away, it is reminiscent to 2001 in its cryptic style and context. This movie just impressed me from start to finish. Every time I leave a movie thinking I don't get it, but still feel like I've been entertained, I feel like it was $8.50 well-spent.Go see this movie. You'll either like it, or completely hate it, there doesn't seem to be a happy medium with this one.

I had hoped and prayed I would not live to see another film as bad as the Matrix but Fight Club is. In a way it is even worse since it is not as obviously silly. The actors can really play the directing is as good as could be expected by someone like Fincher (I loved Se7en). So what is wrong? Well, it is sick. Now, that is not a smart thing to say when criticising  a film but there is no way to avoid it. Fight Club is extremely violent. This is something I do not like in general but for a movie with a title like Fight Club to be expected. And it is not senseless violence like in Matrix but belonging to the story. Indeed it is the essence and in this sense acceptable. What is wrong, if not evil, is that it is presented as a possible solution to the emptiness we feel in our lives. So our generation did not enjoy the blessing of an honest good war? No wonder we degenerate and start buying IKEA furniture. Is this a joke? It is not meant as one.Our hero (the `Narrator') cannot sleep. He is not really happy but who is. What to do? First he finds some unusual hobby. He goes to meetings of people who really suffer.  And the mixture of real feelings mixed with the ridiculous situation gives him energy some fake `sense of life'. There he meets the beautiful Marla. My heart jumped with joy. There was some kindred spirit. They should fall in love, marry, settle down, have some kids live happily (more or less) ever after. That is what I want (I know I am the one who is sick but this is what watching classic Hollywood movies did to me.) It would have been perfect. Unfortunately the film would have been over after fifteen minutes. That is why our hero first has to go to point zero. And he does it by establishing this Fight Club and moving in with lovely Brad. Okay, why not. But does it have to be terror organisation next? Come on. What is the point of the whole thing? You enjoyed the film? Punch yourself on the nose and start thinking. Or even better stop pretending that you do. The schizophrenia angle was rather foreseeable but the happy ending was okay. Like I said... the two hours in between where at best annoying at worst...

Most of us will stop here, or at Jason Lives depending on your feelings for Part 5.  Personally, I believe this film deserves at least a rating of 5.2 on its own website, but I am not the judge.  But I can be the judge of what I believe is pleasing for the eye to see.The Final Chapter is the final chapter in which Jason is still somewhat 'alive.'  He can still run in this movie, and still seems somewhat scary as he hovers in the doorways and mainly in the darkness.  This movie also has so much symbolism, plot, character foils, and such that it is a masterpiece next to the original.  The setting is totally remarkable(the two adjacent cabin-houses with numerous windows), and the characters are not the usual cardboard cut-outs from the previous three films.  This is my all time favorite Jason sequel to date.  I LOVE the cast (especially the sweet, charming Barbara Howard who plays Sara).  And don't question me why, I just do.  It's neat to see Corey Feldman so young.  Reminds me of myself.  A little 80's horror movie FREEEAK!  I rate all of the Jason sequels with either 8-10.  But this movie REALLY DOES deserve a solid 10.  There is a pleasantly large body count of 13, corny sex scenes, enough dialogue, enough plot, and so much gore that even I have to close my eyes.  Now that is seriously bad!  Rarely will a movie do that to me.But back to the effective, amazing symbolism.  If you are a TRUE, a true Jason fan, then you will be able to see how director Joseph Zito uses Jason's motives to be the cause of his slaying in the end (which is also a very memorable scene in the series).  Director Zito portrays the Jarvis family (the main characters in the movie) as the simple, backwoods, rarely-go-to-town type of family.  Kind of like Jason and his mother used to be.  And it's official, Jason Voorhees kills camp counselors because one killed his mother, and Tommy (Feldman) killed Jason because Jason killed his mother.  Now would you look at that!  Perfect directing!  Bonafide symbolism.  It makes perfect sense.  Now if only they would have stopped here with Jason dead and buried for the same reason that he killed his victims.  It just goes to show that you don't mess with a boy's mother.  Or you will pay the consequences.Truthfully this movie should have at least five points on the site because it is just as good as part one.  If it would have been part one, and the only one, then people would look back now and say Hey, that was a great movie!  But they've been ruined by sequels, as the saying goes.  But I seriously believe that not enough people have seen The Final Chapter enough to respect it.  I grew up with them.  They provided my entertainment on those boring Friday and Saturday nights when I was too young to go out. Besides, its practically Feldman's debut.I give it a solid 10\/10!  Sure, it's gross and may be considered inhumane to want to watch it, but so are you!  Nobody's perfect.  Have a good time while you live.  Watch Friday the 13th Part 4, and you'll be satisfied with yourself.  Trust me.

Of those three wonderful performances, I give the nod to the hugely talented and charismatic actor, Washington, who gives a stunning and towering performance as the boxer who was falsely imprisoned for 20 years for the killing of three white people in a New Jersey bar in 1966.  This is an Oscar worthy performance of the highest caliber in a powerful film that focuses on racism, political corruption and sheer determination of the human spirit. Norman Jewison has done a fabulous job of chronicling the tragic life of the great boxer nicknamed The Hurricane.  After being falsely convicted due to a corrupt and racist detective (Dan Hedaya), Carter (Denzel Washington) is sent to prison where he spent 20 years for a crime that he did not commit.  Many people, including celebrities such as Ellen Burstyn and Bob Dylan came to his aid, but to no avail.  It was not until a young boy (Vicellous Reon Shannon), who became captivated by his story and a trio of Canadian activists that started the ball rolling in full gear that eventually led to his release from prison.  While the film is expertly directed with some great black and white fight scenes and the handling of the back and forth time frame, the film does not dig deep enough to explore the issue of racial injustice within the judiciary system during the 60's.  It basically uses the racist detective (who is the motivating factor) as the only one involved in this tragic display of injustice.  Also the Canadian trio (Hannah, Unger, Schreiber) are a little too righteous and squeaking clean and made out to look like they were the only ones who brought this whole travesty to justice.  Regardless, you cannot take away the power of this film or the performance of Washington.Young Shannon as the black youth Lesra who strikes a bond with Carter does a nice job, the great character actor Hedaya as the racist detective is purely despicable and Rod Steiger who appears briefly as a judge makes up for his appearance in the awful End of Days. But this picture belongs entirely to Denzel Washington.  Washington who has played larger than life characters before as Malcolm X in Spike Lee's 1992 film and South African martyr Steven Biko in Cry Freedom gives the performance of his career that should garner him an Oscar.  This is a very powerful performance of a man who held onto his dignity throughout his entire ordeal and never let the system beat him down, it is truly inspiring.  Washington is strong, moving and explosive throughout; it is this year's best performance in an outstanding year of acting.  This is a case of the role and actor coming together for a flawless fit that just ignites the screen. At 45 years of age, Washington who worked out to fine tune his physical appearance has a body that would put a twenty-something to shame.  Washington is one of our top actors today who for the most part gives great performances, but his turn as The Hurricane will literally blow you away.  Like fellow actor George Clooney, Denzel Washington's career started as a doctor in the brilliant hospital TV series St. Elsewhere in the 80's.  Check out one of this year's best pictures that display an actor at the height of his career.

Washington is strong, moving and explosive throughout; it is this year's best performance in an outstanding year of acting.  This is a case of the role and actor coming together for a flawless fit that just ignites the screen. At 45 years of age, Washington who worked out to fine tune his physical appearance has a body that would put a twenty-something to shame.  Washington is one of our top actors today who for the most part gives great performances, but his turn as The Hurricane will literally blow you away.  Like fellow actor George Clooney, Denzel Washington's career started as a doctor in the brilliant hospital TV series St. Elsewhere in the 80's.

Of those three wonderful performances, I give the nod to the hugely talented and charismatic actor, Washington, who gives a stunning and towering performance as the boxer who was falsely imprisoned for 20 years for the killing of three white people in a New Jersey bar in 1966.  This is an Oscar worthy performance of the highest caliber in a powerful film that focuses on racism, political corruption and sheer determination of the human spirit. Norman Jewison has done a fabulous job of chronicling the tragic life of the great boxer nicknamed The Hurricane.  After being falsely convicted due to a corrupt and racist detective (Dan Hedaya), Carter (Denzel Washington) is sent to prison where he spent 20 years for a crime that he did not commit.  Many people, including celebrities such as Ellen Burstyn and Bob Dylan came to his aid, but to no avail.  It was not until a young boy (Vicellous Reon Shannon), who became captivated by his story and a trio of Canadian activists that started the ball rolling in full gear that eventually led to his release from prison.  While the film is expertly directed with some great black and white fight scenes and the handling of the back and forth time frame, the film does not dig deep enough to explore the issue of racial injustice within the judiciary system during the 60's.  It basically uses the racist detective (who is the motivating factor) as the only one involved in this tragic display of injustice.  Also the Canadian trio (Hannah, Unger, Schreiber) are a little too righteous and squeaking clean and made out to look like they were the only ones who brought this whole travesty to justice.  Regardless, you cannot take away the power of this film or the performance of Washington.Young Shannon as the black youth Lesra who strikes a bond with Carter does a nice job, the great character actor Hedaya as the racist detective is purely despicable and Rod Steiger who appears briefly as a judge makes up for his appearance in the awful End of Days. But this picture belongs entirely to Denzel Washington.

First of all, it is a bit over three hours long.  Has to be meaningful, right?  Wrong.  And here is why.1)  Good acting--yes, the acting was incredible.  I'll give it that.  However, acting does not create meaning in a film, it only enhances it.2)  Biblical references--many people assume that anything that is related to the Bible is deeply important in their own lives.  However, this is not always the case.  The pertinent Bible verse here (Exodus 812) is simply a factual verse--there isn't a lesson which can be learned from it, at least, not in the context of this movie.3)  Connecting characters--but, you say, there are so many characters, so many stories which are connected at the end!  So?  Just because one person's life relates to another doesn't mean it relates to mine.  Plus, many of the 'connections' are very thin, and about half of the ways they relate the plots together turn out to be simple familial relationships, which really have no meaning.So, instead of understanding something new about myself (which I did after I saw American Beauty), I spent three hours in a seat trying very hard to do so.  That was the only thing that kept me in the seat, honestly.  Very few of the many plots were developed well enough for me to care what happened.  The characters were, with the exception of the child Stanley, completely psychotic and seemed to bring their own troubles upon them and then attempt to solve those problems by saying the 'F word' repeatedly.  I think this movie had more swearing than South Park.The minimal entertainment value came from Tom Cruise's character and the pure hilarity of seeing frogs falling from the sky.Sure, this movie made me think some things.  Weird stuff happens.  Don't cheat on your wife.  That sort of thing.  But nothing that could really change the way I thought about myself, which is obviously what it was trying to do.  In other words, 3 hours wasted.  I give it about 1 point per hour--a 3 out of 10.If you found something in the movie that I missed, please email me.

Whilst the latter is both my favourite all time movie and musical, The King and I is only second to it. Most of this, is due in part to the wonderful performances of Deborah Kerr, Yul Brynner and a delightful supporting cast. Musical characters have been immortalised by few in the time musicals were fashionable. A few would be Julie Andrews' Maria, Gene Kelly's character from Singin' in the Rain, Judy Garland's Dorothy and James Cagney's George M. Cohan from the biopic Yankee Doodle Dandy. Brynner, in his best and most defining role, has forever left his mark on the King, arrogantly fierce, so simple, so desperate, so true. Although not a singer and well known to be dubbed by Marni Nixon, the 'ghost' favourite of Hollywood musicals, Deborah Kerr gives another beautiful and loved performance as the English governess, with son Louis, travels to 1860s Siam to be tutor to the Royal children. Her performance demanded character, command and charm, and Kerr managed to successfully combine all three in a memorable performance. But it is the Rodgers and Hammerstein score that tops it all off. The element of the screenplay in the FOX movie adaptions was not always the strongest. Tentative and urging was Something Wonderful. I Whistle a Happy Tune, bright, calming and inspirational. Getting to Know You sets the mood of happiness, Hello, Young Lovers keeps a note of optimism, and the rich, lush score of the overture and throughout the film make it memorable. But it is Shall We Dance?, a joyful song that I believe to be the best of the lot. Although it is melodiously challenged because of Gertrude Lawrence's low voice range, it is still one of the best of the duo's scores. Cinemascope, used first in the first of the Rodgers and Hammerstein movies of the year Carousel, provided opportunities to open up moments in the picture. On a widescreen print, only then can the real grandeur, splendour and colour of the enormous sets and opulence of the movie itself can be fully appreciated.Despite my love for the musical, since viewing both Anna and the King of Siam and the new Jodie Foster, Chow Yun-Fat movie Anna and the King, the flaws in what was previously believed to be an accurate and true account of Anna Leonowens story, have unfortunately ruined the musical, both in Anna's life and the depiction of the Siamese court.

This is not even to mention some of the highly illogical moments in the movie (how is it possible to outrace a wave of water which is moving at supersonic speed on a motorbike?).So, what was positive about this movie? I mentioned the Russian protagonist as flat? Well, that doesn't make him much worse than the rest of the cast - although the actor here probably even didn't have a chance to show he can act. Most of the cast would do better by staying in sit-coms. Only Morgan Freeman and Maximilian Schell stood out in their performances. And, another plus for the movie, Freeman portrayed a black US president.If you want a good disaster movie stay to the 70's Earthquake and the like.

Tim Robbins plays Jacob Singer, a Vietnam vet who suffers hallucinations, haunting flashbacks, and gets into weird situations.  He is at the end of his rope. Jezebel, his girlfriend, cares very much about him.  This movie has a lot of symbolism in it, some that are so miniscule but so important that you miss it.  It's a movie that is rare and unique and makes you both smile and cry. By the end, you feel as if you were Jacob, wanting all the chaos to stop. The main key is Tim Robbins who plays Jacob, whether he's just doing what he does day in or day out or if he's crying you pity him.  The opening scene is very horrifying.  It takes you to Vietnam where the problem starts.  What I like about this movie is that each scene will end abruptly and suddenly your somewhere else, trying to make sense of what's happened almost like Jacob is.  One of the most heart wrenching scenes is after a party, Jacob is in bed shivering while Jezebel is telling him she doesn't understand what's happening to him.  She finds out he is running of fever of 106 degrees, with the help of some neighbors, he's put into a bathtub filled with cold water and ice.  He's crying and screaming but then we're taken back to Vietnam in a flash.  He also had a past with an ex-wife who threw him out when he employed at a post office after going to college six years for a doctorate. They had three boys but one dies and the fact continues to destruct Jacob throughout the film.  Confused yet?  Well, on the first viewing it is.  Butit's such a great movie that, you need to see it more then just a couple of times.  The beautiful ending, which I won't give away is so gorgeous, with the score and the acting, that you'll need to get a box of kleenex.  And don't be reluctant to see it because it's classified as horror, believe me the only horror that it shows is the reality, because if you miss this, you'll be missing out on one hell of a show.
