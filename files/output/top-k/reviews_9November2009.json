[{"date":"9 November 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Ah, Pittsboig?? By the end of Wonder Boys, a trip to Pittsburgh sounds, not so bad. Even the lousy weather makes one feel swell in this movie. Interesting and intelligent characters handling 'moments of truths'. Bonding with with wit, and a pinch of uncharacteristic selflessness. It's an action movie for the mind and the acting is as real as the rain. Most impressive for me, is Toby. Often times I can't tell if a guy or gal had to work hard to play a role as well as it is played. I'd hate to think that McGuire handled the role easily. He's just too good. My best guess is that 25-30 minutes into this movie, 80% to 90% of the viewers are 95% sure that they're stuck with an 'OK' movie. That's not OK. It's a Disney feel good movie for adults.
