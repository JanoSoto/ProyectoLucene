Embry is a shy poet determined to express his longtime feelings for the most popular girl in school after she breaks up with her dumb jock boyfriend; Korsmo is a brainy nerd trying to settle a score; Green&#x97;in an amusing performance&#x97;is an insecure trendsetter trying desperately to lose his virginity. The cast is likable and energetic, and there are some funny gags, but the results are strained and predictable.

Born the daughter of a cutthroat criminal litigator, Cher (Silverstone) devotes her life to helping her father, friends, teachers, and all those around her though she can't quite seem to help herself. Hip, laugh-out loud funny film from director Amy Heckerling is a definite upgrade from the run-of-the-mill teen genre, with believable characters and situations, and witty, colorful dialogue. Silverstone is a true delight in the lead, and she's surrounded by a likable supporting cast. *** ","genre":null},{"date":"12 April 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Smart, good-natured and insightful teen flick is a look at a couple of rich, fashionable teenage girls who live in Beverly Hills and dedicate their lives to shopping and looking glamorous.

Nearly twenty years later, he's moved on with his life, has a son, and has made a name for himself as a successful writer. He returns home as a local celebrity to join the teaching staff, but once again encounters his old childhood nemesis who's bent on repeating the same torment despite their advanced ages. Not as bad as it sounds, with two likable, enthusiastic leads who provide some occasional laughs, but the film's dedication to juvenile slapstick grows tiresome after a while. Fans of the actors may not mind. ** ","genre":null},{"date":"12 April 2002","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" An elementary school nerd, plagued by insecurity and the need to fit in, lives in a nightmare at the hands of a big, fearsome bully.

Carrey and Daniels star as two naive dimwits who go on a cross-country road trip carrying a briefcase full of cash, totally ignorant of the fact that they've plunged themselves headfirst into a kidnapping scheme. For the most part this film is nothing more than a juvenile exercise in gross-out gags and toilet humor, but the cast is so enthusiastic and so infectiously likable that you almost have to laugh and enjoy this silly little ride. Carrey and Daniels are perfectly cast as two witless morons who just can't seem to get a clue. **½ ","genre":null},{"date":"12 April 2002","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Blatantly stupid but broadly funny comedy that 'dumbs down' the buddy genre.
