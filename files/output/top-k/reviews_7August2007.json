I won't spoil it.Charlie Sheen is typically light-hearted (this performance is more akin to say, Hot Shots or Good Advice, or Men at Work, than say, Platoon), but that's fine, I personally love him in these sorts of roles, I think he has great comedic personality.Michael Biehn, as always, is great. It is a wonder to me, and many other fans, why he was, and indeed still is being underused. He's a versatile, charismatic actor who has definitely been overlooked for some roles (perfect for him) given to lesser actors.S Epatha Merceson rates a mention, because even though this is definitely B-grade all the way, it is easy to see why she picked up a recurring role in Law and Order not actually too long after this film was made. She plays the wife of Chief the guy that gets killed because he's the obligatory i have a wife and a life guy. Anyway, Michael Biehn aka Lt James Curran, goes to deliver the bad news to her, and when she breaks down, it's really believable and you can feel her sadness in one of the most anguished screams i've ever heard on film. Okay, she's no GREAT actor, but i think her performance (she has about, say, 10 minutes total screen time) is the best in the entire film.Some of the others on here, who unfortunately have taken this film seriously, and label it racist, derogatory to Arabic people, are inaccurate I think. This is a dodgy action movie that is NOT trying to make a statement one way or the other about America's politics, military or their involvement in the Middle East. You want a racist movie? See Black Hawk Down and how it portrays the Somali people...and that's a movie that you are SUPPOSED to take seriously. I say lighten up and see this for what it is, an action B-movie set amidst the Middle East conflict. If it was a movie about the British military, it would probably be set in Northern Ireland...is there REALLY any difference?? It's not ultra-violent, it has some comedic moments and a bit of a love story, some intrigue, and some fine performances. What more could one ask from an action movie anyway? Enjoy.

The group that we are presented with seemed fine, just a little socially inept perhaps apart from the character of Martini (De Vito) whom was a little odd. I first had this suspicion when I saw them all playing cards with one another to reasonable success although McMurphy's (Nicholson) expertise in card playing later on only emphasises the incorrectness from earlier on. Martini's so pleased to be finally playing cards correctly that he just keeps exclaiming hit me, hit me, hit me. This idea of having a comic and often dramatic film set inside one of these places makes for pure gold.This brings me onto the character of McMurphy. Obviously the audience watching this film aren't as crazy and (hopefully) aren't as socially inept as the characters we focus on in this film so that means we're going to relate to him the most as he's the most like us although some may swerve more to Billy (Dourif). Although brilliantly acted by Nicholson, he is further emphasised through the fact he's not wearing plain white like the rest of the inmates, meaning he stands out. McMurphy's reactions to what was going on, especially during the group therapy sessions, also stood out as they were pretty much my reactions also! I was smirking and looking confused at what was happening; McMurphy even gets restless with these people, something we all would feel after a while in that situation.Also, watching McMurphy's relationship and friendship build up with the character of the Chief (Sampson) is just as fun as it is fascinating. There's this huge, native American who's supposedly dumb and deaf yet McMurphy gives him all the time in the world to try and develop him. The basketball game scene is particularly memorable in its hilarity and the way in which it shows Chief engaging and succeeding in what it is he's been told to do. Remember we think he's dumb and deaf.Another piece of clever film-making is the Chief himself. In a way, I think the Chief is perhaps supposed to represent the audience in the sense that if the audience was a character, they'd be the Chief. He doesn't talk or do much (similar to what an audience does when they watch a film), he helps McMurphy out when he gets involved in a fight with a guard (Whilst I was watching, was praying someone intervened and it just happened to be Chief) and we even see things from his point of view (the only time it happens in the film) as McMurphy winks at him to show he's OK. So this is very much putting the audience in the film as one of the characters; of course this is played with later on when certain things are revealed and regarding whether or not people escape I find it very symbolic who does and who doesn't.In conclusion, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is just one of those films that is funny, engaging, entertaining and is actually a very smart film considering what I think it does regarding all the characters and everything. This twinned with the character of Nurse Ratched (Fletcher) who I stress isn't so much as evil as she is doing her job, still looms every now and again threatening privileges. I am not surprised this film won so many Oscar's as it would still do today &#150; a great and very memorable film.

After watching Smith's 1995 follow-up, Mallrats, and finding it very funny, I quickly rented this predecessor, with high expectations. I was aware that when Mallrats came into theatres, it wasn't very successful, and was considered a disappointment after Clerks., so I thought there was a really good chance I would like this movie even better, which didn't happen.One Saturday, a convenience store clerk named Dante Hicks is called into work by his boss, even though it's supposed to be his day off. Unfortunately, not only is he not happy about having to go to work today, he also has many problems to face while there. He has trouble with his love life, with his girlfriend, Veronica, pestering him at the store about how he should be going to college instead of working there, and revealing a very dirty secret! Dante has a dimwitted, lazy friend named Randal, who is a clerk at the video store next door. He often drops into the convenience store to talk to Dante, and his behaviour costs the store some customers! These problems are certainly not the only ones Dante experiences while on the job, and he isn't even supposed to be working today! Some gags in this movie are priceless, probably starting with the one early on with the secret Chewlies gum representative in the store, hanging around and discouraging customers from buying cigarettes, giving them lectures on the effects of smoking and encouraging them to buy Chewlies gum, instead! (You might have to see it in order to know what I mean.) More hilarity follows, sometimes involving Randal annoying certain customers! However, Kevin Smith's low-budget, black and white feature-length film-making debut also has its shortcomings. It doesn't have much of a plot at all, there isn't quite enough humour to prevent that from effecting its quality, and some of the conversations may go on a bit too long. I also think that it may sometimes get a little TOO juvenile, especially during the part where it is discovered that an elderly man has died in the store's washroom, and what caused his death! It's obvious that some would hate this film with a passion, due to all the filth. It could also bore some viewers (it bored me at times, or came very close to doing so). Personally, I found enough laughs in Clerks. to give it a 7, and since many have definitely enjoyed it more, looking at the IMDb rating, I must be missing something. Some may find a lot of the dialogue more amusing than I did. If extremely raunchy, R-rated comedies with heavy sex jokes, toilet humour, offensiveness, tastelessness, etc. disturb you, Clerks. is definitely NOT a movie for you, as that's just what it is!

If extremely raunchy, R-rated comedies with heavy sex jokes, toilet humour, offensiveness, tastelessness, etc. disturb you, Clerks. is definitely NOT a movie for you, as that's just what it is! However, if you have a sick sense of humour, this may or may not turn out to be a great comedy to you, but either way, I think you'd probably like at least SOME of the gags.

A boy called Campbell, Jr., grows up in upstate New York. At home his father has many technical trade papers and one book. It has photographs of heaps of dead bodies in it. The boy leafs through the book, his dad doesn't like his doing that. What should this tell me? The family moves away from upstate New York to Berlin. BANG. It is 1938, the boy is a married man in Berlin and a theater playwright. What kind of plays does he write? In what language? Is he successful? His wife is an actress and looks glamorous. The parents move back to the USA and invite their son to do the same. He does not. Why? Because having grown up in Germany he feels more German than American? Because he is successful? Because his wife is? Because he likes his life there? Because he likes the Nazis? Because he is just plain lazy and doesn't like change? Don't ask me.Possibly, the man just does not care, is not interested in politics, is a kind of an existentialist. He states that he is deeply in love with his wife. He speaks of his Republic of Two (meaning he and his wife). There is little to no evidence proving his love for his wife in the movie, it much more seems a Republic of One.On the request of an American agent Campbell, Jr., agrees to broadcast anti Semitic Nazi hate propaganda to American listeners as a device for transmitting encrypted messages to American authorities who read between the lines. The crucial meeting with the agent on a Berlin park bench is short, unexciting and anti climactic, the decision to play along comes pretty easily with no explanation, the rise up to broadcaster seems to be uneventful and apparently fast.So now we have Campbell, Jr., presenting himself over the air as the Last Free American. The scheme for transmitting secret messages is fairly realistic and exciting - although one wonders what happened when Campbell, Jr., really and honestly had to cough, hiccup etc. (must have scrambled the messages terribly). Anyway, the Nazis lose, the wife dies (touring in the Crimean for German troops - I never heard such tours really happened on German front lines in WW II), Campbell, Jr., says he goes to the Russian front but does not go, is captured by an American soldier who recognizes his mug (how come?), is dragged to a sight-seeing tour in Auschwitz, is then released and resettled with the help of the Crucial Agent somewhere in the City of New York.AND THIS IS WHERE THE STORY REALLY STARTS BANG. From now on it is like a short story by Paul Auster. It is 1961, Campbell, Jr., lives in New York tenement as a has-been and mourns the loss of his wife. Nobody really cares - or do they? Yes, somehow they do, and his neighbors offer some sort of distraction. Auschwitz survivors. A painter. Some American supremacists &#132;discover him and want him to be their figurehead. They even find his presumed dead wife for him, or is she his wife? Anyway, in the end Campbell, Jr., calls in at the Israeli consulate, and they obligingly give him the Big War Criminal treatment, placing him in the cell adjacent to Adolf Eichmann's. He writes his life story and, once this task finished, hangs himself on the typewriter's ribbons without getting sooty the least bit.While I can see that there must be an issue of guilt and of loss, I just had the impression that the main character is a person who at all times is pretty indifferent to everything and hardly capable of love for anyone. So I found it difficult to sympathize for this looser who mourns his loss. Amazingly, many reviewers focus on his status as a potential war hero, having put his reputation at stake for playing the Last Free American. I assume according to them this took a lot of courage. As a matter of fact, however, the movie suggests that by accepting the assignment Campbell created for himself a win-win situation, as he would have been politically on the safe side no matter who had won the war. The danger of his being uncovered never comes up during the first part of the story.One might argue, that the whole story is a dreamlike fantasy and that nobody should bother with historical accuracy or a logical development of the story which explains everything. But even then it fails to make a point, primarily, I suspect, because the love affair in the Republic of Two falls completely flat. This is a pity, especially if you consider that the wife was played by Sheryl Lee, a talented, versatile and sensuous actress. She has much too little screen time and is forced to use a ridiculous German accent. Another somehow neglected aspect are the different texts (confession, broadcast and hidden messages), but I guess this is largely unfilmable. Maybe I should give the book a chance.

He made some great and well known classics in his career but yet he isn't as appreciate and much remembered as his fellow colleagues from the same period, such as lets say Tod Browning . I mean, if you now say the name James Whale, while anybody really know he was the director of the 1931 Frankenstein movie and its perhaps even better sequel The Bride of Frankenstein? It therefor is great that a biopic was made about this sort of forgotten and flamboyant, greatly talented director, who was among the best of his time.It's a great and wonderfully acted movie about James Whale, although I have the feeling that the movie is often more about James Whale's homosexuality than really about his life and career. Of course nothing wrong with a story like that but you can wonder if this at all time is the best approach for a biopic. The movie is also about Whale's final days, although it frequently uses flashbacks. The movie was also more about Frankenstein and The Bride of Frankenstein than any of Whale's other movies, though he obviously made many more and well known movies, in different genres. But I can understand why they did this. The Frankenstein movies get in this movie linked to Whale's real life and his ideas and views on things. It are of course also the two movies for which he will be always remembered. It's an approach that works great and effective for the movie but again you can wonder, if this is the best approach for a biopic. So perhaps as a biopic this movie isn't entirely effective even though the movie is definitely insightful about the James Whale characters but as a drama and character study this is simply just a great movie to watch.The entire approach to how the story is told is also great and original. It chooses to tell the story off Whale through the things he tells his gardener, who Whale befriends, though his intentions at first are obviously aimed toward something else. While befriending the gardener Whale looks back on his life and career and gives his own personal views and ideas of things, of course also mainly regarding homosexuality. Whale was one of the few openly gay high society and public persons of his time, which might very well have meant also the downfall of his career. The approach doesn't sound like a logical one or engaging one but it works out extremely well and is really effective in the movie. The script, by Bill Condon himself, also won an Oscar.The movie gets mostly carried by its actors. Ian McKellen was a great choice for the main lead and he gives one fine performance. It was a real big gamble to cast Bredan Fraser in a this sort of role, after appearing mostly in weak simple comedies before his role in this movie. Brendan Fraser never have been at his best in serious type of roles but he handles this role well. It also isn't a completely heavy and serious type of role, which also makes the movie easier and more pleasant to watch.The movie does have its slower moments, especially in the beginning of the movie but nevertheless Bill Condon shows he's a capable director by making every sequence work and keep things flowing well, despite the use of flashbacks, that normally also slow down movies. He also makes sure that the movie never becomes too heavy.The flashbacks and more dreamy like of sequences are all good looking and fit in with the rest of the movie. But perhaps with the exception of it's WW I moments. I don't know, for some reason WW I fighting sequences always look kind of cheap and fake, like they are shot in studios. Guess WW I is just a very hard war to capture and translate to the silver screen. Might also explain why there are actually so little movies regarding WW I.A greatly made and acted movie, that really deserves to be seen.8\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"7 August 2007","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" For some reason James Whale is a sort of a forgotten director.

Shortly after the crash he receives a letter from Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) the owner of an an art gallery specialising in comic books & related artwork, Elijah suffers from a rare disease called Osteogenesis Imperfecta which means he has very brittle bones which are easily broken. Elijah tells David that he feels there are people on the opposite side of the scale to him, people with very strong bones & great strength & him walking away from that train crash is proof that he is one of them. Elijah tries to convince David that he is a real life comic book superhero & that his unique powers should be used for good...Written, co-produced & directed by M. Night Shyamalan Unbreakable was his follow up to the huge commercial success that was The Sixth Sense (1999) & both films have much in common, both are set in Philedelphia, both star Bruce Willis who again has a strong involvement with a young boy (no, not in that way...) & both have a genuinely effective & unexpected twist ending. I'll start straight away by saying that I think both The Sixth Sense & Unbreakable are really good films which I like & I find it hard to call one better than the other, if I'm honest I'd probably say The Sixth Sense is slightly better but it's a close run thing. The script which takes itself very seriously has an intriguing & fascinating premise, forget your overblown superhero flicks like Batman (1988), X-Men (2000), Spider-Man (2002) & Fantastic Four (2005) as this is very low key & tries to portray an ordinary man suddenly discovering that he has superhuman powers. Again though it's low key as he can't shoot lasers from his eyes or fly, in fact the whole film is very quiet & very ordinary which was obviously a deliberate thing on the filmmakers part. It's all here with his weakness, his arch enemy & using his powers for good but in a very subtle sort of way that I just liked. The dialogue is very sparse & not much is said, the character's are good & there are lots of little things they do or say that you may not pick up on the first time you watch it but suddenly fall into place as the story progresses. My only real problem is that it's a bit slow & the ending while having a nice twist feels unfinished & rushed.Director Shyamalan does alright although the film is a bit dreary to watch as all the colours are muted, it's as if the film takes place in a world where there isn't a sun & it's overcast all the time. There are no big action scenes or anything like that so don't expect any as the film relies on strong storytelling & an interesting premise. At least Unbreakable is something just that bit different & for that alone it's worth a watch. I wouldn't say it's ever scary like The Sixth Sense but it has a certain atmosphere to it.With a supposed budget of about $75,000,000 one has to ask where all the money went although the reported $20,000,000 Willis was paid accounts for a fair chunk of it. It's well made but not particularly stylish or memorable, I don't know it's just a bit drab looking if I'm honest although I'm sure that was intentional. The acting is pretty good although why does everyone whisper so often? I personally like Willis as an actor & Samuel L. Jackson so I don't have a problem with the cast except for the kid who is annoying but isn't in it enough to totally spoil it. According to the IMDb the usually terrible Julianne Moore was offered the part of Willis' wife & I'm throughly glad she turned it down\/didn't get it.Unbreakable is a strange & different sort of fantasy film, it's not for everyone that's for sure but I have to say I really liked it a lot & recommend it. Shyamalan went on to make the alien invasion flick Signs (2002) next with Mel Gibson which I also really liked.

I wouldn't say it's ever scary like The Sixth Sense but it has a certain atmosphere to it.With a supposed budget of about $75,000,000 one has to ask where all the money went although the reported $20,000,000 Willis was paid accounts for a fair chunk of it. It's well made but not particularly stylish or memorable, I don't know it's just a bit drab looking if I'm honest although I'm sure that was intentional.

Shortly after the crash he receives a letter from Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) the owner of an an art gallery specialising in comic books & related artwork, Elijah suffers from a rare disease called Osteogenesis Imperfecta which means he has very brittle bones which are easily broken. Elijah tells David that he feels there are people on the opposite side of the scale to him, people with very strong bones & great strength & him walking away from that train crash is proof that he is one of them. Elijah tries to convince David that he is a real life comic book superhero & that his unique powers should be used for good...Written, co-produced & directed by M. Night Shyamalan Unbreakable was his follow up to the huge commercial success that was The Sixth Sense (1999) & both films have much in common, both are set in Philedelphia, both star Bruce Willis who again has a strong involvement with a young boy (no, not in that way...) & both have a genuinely effective & unexpected twist ending. I'll start straight away by saying that I think both The Sixth Sense & Unbreakable are really good films which I like & I find it hard to call one better than the other, if I'm honest I'd probably say The Sixth Sense is slightly better but it's a close run thing. The script which takes itself very seriously has an intriguing & fascinating premise, forget your overblown superhero flicks like Batman (1988), X-Men (2000), Spider-Man (2002) & Fantastic Four (2005) as this is very low key & tries to portray an ordinary man suddenly discovering that he has superhuman powers. Again though it's low key as he can't shoot lasers from his eyes or fly, in fact the whole film is very quiet & very ordinary which was obviously a deliberate thing on the filmmakers part. It's all here with his weakness, his arch enemy & using his powers for good but in a very subtle sort of way that I just liked. The dialogue is very sparse & not much is said, the character's are good & there are lots of little things they do or say that you may not pick up on the first time you watch it but suddenly fall into place as the story progresses. My only real problem is that it's a bit slow & the ending while having a nice twist feels unfinished & rushed.Director Shyamalan does alright although the film is a bit dreary to watch as all the colours are muted, it's as if the film takes place in a world where there isn't a sun & it's overcast all the time. There are no big action scenes or anything like that so don't expect any as the film relies on strong storytelling & an interesting premise. At least Unbreakable is something just that bit different & for that alone it's worth a watch.

Beyond the tasteless quasi-pun, the real problem surfaced as a question how do you turn sadistic serial murders into a profit-making franchise? There was a time when writers made serial narratives concerning infamous villains - i.e., e.g., Fu Manchu or Dracula - because there was something unexplored about the villains particular genius for committing evil and escaping that had not yet been completely explored in the first entry of the series; interestingly, Bram Stoker wrote only the one Dracula novel, which explored the character exhaustively; when that character arrived in Hollywood, his first appearance was an extreme truncation of the original novel, thus leaving plenty opportunity for further exploration of the character in film.So the problem the producers of Hannibal Rising raise is, has the character been exhaustively studied or not? Because if he has, additional sequels are a waste of time.And having witnessed Hannibal Rising, I confess I believe the character exhausted; but that's another review.Here, let me just say that it was good to see Mann's film again recently, to return to the series' cinematic origins, to get a clearer perspective of the Lecter character as he was originally conceived.What makes the Lecter character fascinating in Manhunter is that he is pure genius become pure sociopath. This is a character who first committed murder just to see what it was like, not out of any sense of outrage or revenge. The most important line in the film is when Lecter remarks to the FBI profiler, if you do what god does often enough, you become god (assuming that what god does most often is kill people). While the character of the practicing serial killer, the Tooth Fairy, is rich in unresolved and unresolvable sexual tensions, this line from Lecter describes the real ground both he and the Tooth Fairy walk, a march towards some assumed omnipotence that requires murder as its ultimate manifestation.what's disturbing about this wish for god-hood is that we all either feel it or at least the temptation of it pulling at us at some time. Like the profiler in the film, we aren't really sure we have a real defense against Lecter's claim that he and we are alike.Mann's success in this film is his ability to recognize the seriousness of these issues while still constructing a rock-solid police procedural around them. Unlike the later series, there's nothing romantic about this film, although there are certainly thrilling set-pieces sprinkled through-out. I notice that some of the reviewers critical of the film remark the naturalistic, low-key atmosphere of the film as (severely critical) slow or as (apologetically lightly critical) low-budget. Actually, Mann has all the resources with which to make his film, and he moves it along at a pace that is thoughtful while allowing sudden interjections of rapid action sequences. This is what Mann does best, this is why anyone would hire him to direct a film, this is why his fans pay to see his films. This is a thinking adult's director, not a splashy flash-in-the-pan wannabe.I don't know if I will ever see the other Lecter films again in 10 years; but I've seen Manhunter once a decade so far, and it remains wholly satisfying - albeit in a disturbing way, of course, given its subject. But I have a suspicion I will like it just as much 10 years from now, when I see it again.By the way, I prefer the 'director's cut' (which rates a 'ten').

The villains cause more laughs than anything else in the film, and are the biggest insult to batman fans everywhere.Even the heroes are awful- with the clean cut, smooth ladies man George Clooney playing the dark, haunted Bruce Wayne, Batman himself is ruined by a woefully bad miscasting.So, all in all? If you want a movie to laugh at, then please watch this movie- it is quite simply hilarious in parts ('My condition has left me cold to your pleas of mercy'). But, if you came to watch a batman film, and not a pun ridden mess, then avoid this like the plague.

And Krull is a perfect example.Where George Lucas grafted an epic swashbuckling fantasy onto the background of a space opera, Krull takes this conceit to far more bizarre extremes, by trying to meld SF elements with Mediaeval sword and sorcery. And not surprisingly, the film is a disjointed mess.Lucas was clever enough to balance out his two approaches so they stayed within the realm of believability. But director Peter Yates doesn't have the same skills, and fumbles many of Krull's narrative points. The film is made up of many pieces that don't quite fit together.The storyline is a classic quest scenario. A beautiful princess is kidnapped by an evil Beast that wants to conquer the world (of Krull). A courageous prince has to brave many perils, and rescue her from a formidable fortress (a teleporting spaceship!).Krull, quite frankly, is one of the most bizarre films I've ever seen. How the filmmakers ever thought they could get away with such a muddled screenplay is beyond belief! As I watch the film, I'm constantly being knocked out by the outrageous lengths it goes to. The film doesn't know if its telling science-fiction, or if its pure fantasy. SF and magic hardly go together. But Krull just doesn't seem to understand that. Evil knights with lances that shoot laser beams. And alongside the science, we have magical magicians that turn into animals. What a confused film this is! Krull has a peculiar sort of fascination. Trying to watch two completely incompatible genres co-habit. The film tries very hard, and straddles both approaches, but never really manages to achieve either one.In regards to the cast, they're a bit of a mixed bag too. Ken Marshall plays Prince Colwyn, the hero of the piece. But he's not exactly the hardened fighter you're expecting. He hasn't got much charisma, and as a hero, he's surprisingly underwhelming.Lysette Anthony is drop dead gorgeous as Lyssa, the damsel in distress. But since her voice was dubbed over, (in fairness) I can't really appraise her acting ability. Still, the stilted lines of dialogue she comes out with are quite horrid.There are some famous faces yet to go on to more successful careers. Liam Neeson makes an appearance as a thief recruited into Colwyn's quest, but gets screen time too brief to make any real lasting impression.Alun Armstrong is not bad as Torquil, the leader of the bandits that hook up with Colwyn. At least he gives a solid performance. We also have a pompous Freddie Jones as the all-wise Old One Ynyr (not as old as all that), a solemn Cyclops played by Bernard Breslaw, and Francesa Annis' Widow of the Web.Also look out for a young Robbie Coltrane and a pre-Eastenders Todd Carty.I could have done without David Battley's befuddled magician Ergo the Magnificent.The world of Krull is quite a strange place. Mediaeval castles in the middle of nowhere. Alien fortresses that jump from place to place. Blind seers. Horses that ride on fire. The Slayers that shriek like banshees when they're killed. I never really found any of this imaginative. Just odd and unreal. And the special effects are really shabby. Obvious back projections. Artificial landscapes. Poor stop-motion spiders. Yes spiders! It just goes on and on.The Beast himself is an unusual villain. He wants to marry Lyssa for himself, all within the bewildering kaleidoscopic confines of his Black Fortress. How he, who looks like a ten foot high Jabba the Hut, could ever hope to have a relationship with a delicate flower like Lyssa is a mystery. But it is amusing to consider the possibilities. And besides, if King Kong could fall in love with a human, why not the Beast?This is also a film that hasn't done its research. Colwyn needs the Glaive to defeat the Beast. A Glaive is a sword. But when we finally see it, its something not unlike a cross between a shuriken and a starfish. Looks nifty though when it flies through the air!But still, Krull really is quite a failure. It tries to do something different with fantasy\/SF trappings and ends up failing on both counts. I suppose its OK for a mild lark, but any fun and amusement you get from it will be for all the wrong reasons.

Time has turned it into his most analyzed and revisited movie and, in the eyes of many, his masterpiece. I still don't subscribe to the opinion that this is Hitchcock's greatest film (give me The Thirty Nine Steps, Foreign Correspondent or North By Northwest) but it is certainly a wonderfully absorbing mystery, and the original indifference that greeted the film from critics and audiences was totally unjust. It takes multiple viewings to fully appreciate what Hitchcock is up to in this movie - it is a sophisticated and multi-layered film that grows in stature the more times you view it.San Francisco cop John Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart) has a hair-raising escapade on a rooftop while chasing a robber. Thereafter, he develops vertigo (a fear of heights) and retires from the force. Some while later Scottie is contacted by his old friend Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) who wants to hire him for a little unofficial private detective work. Elster is worried by his wife's increasingly outlandish behaviour - she seems to go into a dreamy state of mind and wanders off for hours on end without any explanation as to where she has been. Scottie's job is to tail her and learn where she goes. The mystery thickens when Scotties starts following Madeline Elster (Kim Novak).... the more he learns about her and her wanderings, the more it seems that she is possessed by the spirit of her long-deceased ancestor Carlotta Valdes. Eventually Scottie saves Madeline when she tries to drown herself in San Francisco Bay, and soon after they fall in love. But just as Scottie begins to make headway into her psychological problems, she kills herself by leaping from a bell tower. Scottie is left in a state of mental shock but later, following his release from hospital, he bumps into a woman named Judy (Novak again) who is the exact double of Madeline....Hitchcock generates a stunning air of mystery with Vertigo, coaxing brilliant performances from Stewart and Novak and using the location of San Francisco as almost a third leading character in his story. Stewart's obsession with Novak, and his descent into madness as he grieves over his inability to protect her, is brilliantly portrayed. As ever - in fact, more so than ever - Hitchcock keeps the audience off-balance with his disorientating camera work, ingenious plotting and atmospheric use of colour. Bernard Herrmann contributes a haunting score (his fourth for Hitchcock) that heightens the passion and suspense even further. The solution when it comes is extremely clever, and proves (as if proof is needed) that Hitchcock has a masterful touch when it comes to clever plot twists. The film's chief drawbacks, for me, are the excessively studied pacing in the first half, and the somewhat abrupt ending. On the whole, though, this is a superb film which is always a pleasure to come back to.

Uma Thurman as sexy TV icon Emma Peel? Ralph Fiennes as suave John Steed? Sean Connery as a James Bond-inspired villain? What more could one ask.Well, a better grasp of what made The Avengers such as success on television, for starters. Not that the 1998 film version doesn't attempt here and there to replicate the feel of the original series. Connery's weather-controlling madman is right out of the TV show's playbook, as is a segment virtually lifted whole from the classic Emma Peel episode The House That Jack Built -- and while I think Elizabeth Hurley or Catherine Zeta Jones would have been much more suitable choices for Emma Peel, Uma Thurman does hit most of the right notes. Elsewhere, though, it falls short.Fiennes just doesn't feel right as Steed. Except for his opening scene prancing through a Ministry test-fighting range -- considered by some to be the best and most Avengers-like moment in the film (perhaps due to a welcome cameo appearance by the original Avengers TV theme music) -- he comes off as rather wimpy for lack of a better word. Patrick Macnee's Steed had charisma and was revealed in the TV series to be capable of being quite thuggish when the situation demanded. Fiennes displays none of Macnee's qualities. You know you're in trouble when Macnee, who has an amusing voice-only cameo in the film, displays more personality and charisma with his voice alone than Fiennes does in the entire film. Also a disappointment is Sean Connery, who clearly seems off his game here (thankfully he bounced back in his next film, Entrapment, ironically co-starring one of my dream Mrs. Peels, Catherine Zeta Jones; that film suggests the type of chemistry that is totally lacking between Connery and Thurman in this film). His voice doesn't sound right for some reason, almost as if he played the role with a cold.The biggest problem with the film was the decision to cut its length considerably, strangely enough in the process deleting many of the scenes in the trailer. Without these scenes, much of the film makes little sense, especially the rather unexplained presence of Peel's evil double, whose existence is better explained in the cut scenes. (I highly recommend tracking down the novelization of this film, which includes the cut scenes and makes a lot more sense than the movie).As a longtime Avengers fan I was also disappointed by some of the character decisions. Once again modern filmmakers appear unable to take platonic characters from TV and let them keep their lips apart in the movies. The introduction of a romantic subplot between Steed and Peel really feels out of place and goes back to what I said earlier -- that you need an understanding of how the source material works in order to do a good remake.All this said, The Avengers as a movie isn't the worst thing ever made. And it's entertaining in its own way. At the very least watching Uma Thurman parade through in a series of sexy outfits is not an unpleasant waste of 90 minutes. But as a remake of a classic TV series, this was yet another failed attempt at recapturing the magic, something that is extremely hard to do at the best of times and has only been accomplished by a handful of projects, such as the recent revivals of Battlestar Galactica and Doctor Who.

When you have your aliens speak English (or even worse, English with a funny accent) it comes out, at best, cartoon-like and at worst offensive. From the leaders of the Trade Federation to Jar Jar, the English speaking aliens killed this flick.Then again, dialog has never been Lucas' strong point. How many of his most beloved characters never speak or have only a couple of lines? (Chewie, R2D2, Boba Fett, Darth Maul, Jabba, etc.) Perhaps there were just too many lines, generally.

I, too, have watched the movie multiple times, liking what Bill Murray brought to the character of Larry Darrell, whereas I could barely make it through Lost in Translation. In that latter Murray work, I could not bring myself to care whether he would get together with the chick or not, but in The Razor's Edge I found so many characters to care about. Even a minor character like Joseph, Elliott's butler, showed traces of the conflicts that swirled in the people around him. I think that this deep layering is what strikes a chord with those who love the film.A few points I don't think that Larry did not find what he was seeking. He found his grail on the mountain, in the hut. He was supposed to toil to be worthy of meeting the Holy Man, and when he was eventually given permission to ascend the mountain, he survived harsh conditions to reach the hut. After waiting and waiting for the Holy Man, he comes to a point of realization, smiles over it, and begins to burn the pages of his precious scripture for heat. He did meet the holy man, who was within the self. Moreover, the novel certainly does not suggest that Larry's quest was for naught. He becomes a luminous person who confounds his friends by pursuing his life's purpose with clarity and compassion.Neither do I think that the ending was nihilistic. Byrum faced a labyrinth as Maugham juxtaposed segments in his text, the novelist following the natural rhythm of flashback rather than standard narrative chronology. When Joseph asks Larry Where are you going? and Larry says Home, Joseph follows up with But where is your home, Larry? And Larry answers America. He is going back to the place to rectify the mistakes of his unenlightened youth.Some commenters prefer the 1946 movie, and while I enjoy it, I think it missed the point of the book. Take the scene with the monk that Larry (Tyrone Power) converses with he's not Indian, but a white actor (kind of comically) faking an Indian accent and wearing a robe reminiscent of ancient Greece, and not early twentieth-century India. The philosophy is given as a homily, so viewers have nothing to reach for. Clifton Webb is very entertaining but is over-the-top, and so is Gene Tierney. The movie is less cinema than it is stage-play, and the ending gives the audience little credit for intelligence.Finally, how deeply the 1984 film was faithful to the book does not concern me the Murray version supplied a coherence that made me appreciate the novel more. Other movies which have done that are Out of Africa, The French Lieutenant's Woman, Far From the Madding Crowd, and the latest version of Pride and Prejudice. Good company indeed. Especially when I'm still waiting for the genre to do justice to The Great Gatsby or The Scarlet Letter, whose best versions are slightly above average, and whose worst are slow and indulgent.

Earp and Hickok may have been more of the white hat sort of hero, but Doc made no pretense about having redeeming qualities, except for one he stood by his friend Wyatt when the chips were down. No lawman or cowboy could ask any more or expect any less from a true friend. Of all the portrayals of Doc, Kilmer's version is one of the best ever done for this complex man. His pathos and comic relief that he brings to his part turned this picture into an outstanding example of its genre. In real life, the western hero was never a totally William S.
