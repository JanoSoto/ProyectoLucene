The Iron Giant also works as a re-telling of myth, combining elements as old as storytelling itself. In Joseph Campbell's landmark book, The Hero With A Thousand Faces, he shows how certain themes are constantly recurring in mythology, religion, psychology and literature. Campbell's work leans heavily on the writings of Carl Jung, who believed that these ideas are part of our human heritage and understood on a deeper level (often without our awareness). While this may seem like a lot of baggage to be strapping onto 90 minutes of family entertainment, it works. Furthermore, poet Ted Hughes, the writer of the story on which the film is (loosely) based, knew his mythology as well.While a small book could be written on the themes running through The Iron Giant it's important to avoid the this = that sort of allegory found in Cliff Notes and high school English courses. The giant does not stand for this or that figure in religion or myth. There are elements of Osiris, the Egyptian figure whose body is scattered and re-assembled and Iron John, from the European folk tale collected by the Brothers Grimm and the subject of Robert Bly's generally misunderstood book. There are lots of interesting twists on the classic themes. The character of Dean functions partly in the Iron John role and partly as the Old Wise Man. This figure is often a wizard in folklore (think of Merlin or Gandalf) but the writers turned him into a twenty-something Beatnik sculptor. The list goes on and we haven't even mentioned Hogarth. If this all seems a bit too much like a Required Reading list or a homework assignment ignore this and see the movie. If, however, this all sounds interesting, read Joseph Campbell and see the movie.

All kidding aside, Road House is an attempt to modernise Western and Samurai themes, which leaves reality at the door. The plot focuses upon a bar in a town that appears to have a hospital, an auto dealership, a general store, and maybe a couple of houses. Apparently, a villain is skimming money out of these businesses. I don't know whether a gold mine was found in the town or not, but it would explain how a town so small that there isn't even a pharmacy would net such profits for a standover man.Patrick Swayze was an up-and-coming star, having just come out of Dirty Dancing, and I am certain he fired his agent after getting this as a follow-up. His character has a doctorate in philosophy, but works as a bouncer (this is called putting your degree to good use). He is hired by a bar owner who is literally at his wits' end. His business is failing because his clientele consists of forty-year-old adolescents, felons, power-drinkers, and trustees of modern chemistry, as Swayze puts it.Part of the blame for this lies in the people Frank, the owner, hired previously to help combat the problem. Many of them are little more than forty-year-old adolescents themselves. Right off the bat, Swayze fires several of them simply because they aren't disciplined enough for the trade. One would think that, this being the case, a man with ambitions to turn this sawdust-on-the-floor drunken barndance mill into something respectable would not have hired them in the first place.Anyway, as I previously alluded, Frank's big ambition is to glitz the place up and turn it into something a civilised man, say a brain surgeon, wouldn't be afraid or ashamed to take his family to. The problem, at least when you take into account the miniscule apparent scale of the surrounding town, is that in a scale-based economy, Frank should really be grateful for any business he gets. Swayze sets about restoring order to the locality by beating the crap out of as many thugs as he can. However, for a guy with the martial skill suggested by this film, Swayze finds himself getting injured quite a lot. One of the cardinal rules of a bar fight that he breaks very early in the film is to never turn your back to your opponent. Maybe the profession has changed a lot in fifteen years, but these days, the equivalent of a black belt in at least one martial art is supposed to be a prerequisite for the job. Most of the bouncers in this film fight more like Sid Vicious than they do Bruce Lee.Roger Ebert hits the nail on the head when he states that the houses Dalton and Walsh live in seem to be the only two in the entire town, and everything that happens in one appears to be staged for the benefit of the other. How any business, leave alone one as secondary as a bar, can survive in such a place is really beyond me. He also hits the nail right on the head when he says that Road House exists right on that invisible line that divides a good-bad film from a merely bad one. In its favour, however, is the fact that the director realized what a turkey he was making, and increased the violence quotient as much as he could in order to provide something for the viewer to be entertained by.I gave Road House a five out of ten. Normally, it would be a one out of ten, but it just has a certain kind of charm that outshines its idiocy. It makes perfect fodder for a Bad Film Night&#153;, or a drinking game.

It would be a whole lot of fun. This movie makes me happy all the way through it where I think Danny Boyle was going for a more powerful touchy feely vibe so it would hit its audience hard. I can see his point of showing what heroin really does to a person but to me this film would do nothing other than turn people onto the drug. A film like Requiem for a Dream, that would turn put you off Heroin and any drug that possibly exists in this world. Shallow Grave was a fantastic little gem that spiralled out of nowhere to entertain us to the max whilst also putting us into a corner with these three likable characters for them to turn out to be completely different to what we had thought, well almost anyway. When I saw shallow Grave I really thought the UK had found it director to take us into the new millennium as a great country who makes exceptional films and in a way he has. Shallow Grave was great, Life Less Ordinary was odd but very good, The Beach I found entertaining and very watch able as did 28 Days Later which is Boyle's most interesting film and then Trainspotting which comes after Shallow Grave really which is a film that follows the life of a small town Scottish lad trying to get through the days with his struggle of heroin with his outcast mates. Ewan McGregor takes the lead as Renton with Johnny Le miller, Kevin Mckidd, Ewen Bremmer and Robert Carlyle who out actors everybody on the screen when his character Begbie comes into the story.Overall the movie is mad to watch and fun at the same time with one or two powerful moments that may stay with you or not but to me this wasn't very powerful at all, just had a few messages to give out but that does not make this film a bad one whatsoever.

It would be a whole lot of fun. This movie makes me happy all the way through it where I think Danny Boyle was going for a more powerful touchy feely vibe so it would hit its audience hard. I can see his point of showing what heroin really does to a person but to me this film would do nothing other than turn people onto the drug. A film like Requiem for a Dream, that would turn put you off Heroin and any drug that possibly exists in this world. Shallow Grave was a fantastic little gem that spiralled out of nowhere to entertain us to the max whilst also putting us into a corner with these three likable characters for them to turn out to be completely different to what we had thought, well almost anyway. When I saw shallow Grave I really thought the UK had found it director to take us into the new millennium as a great country who makes exceptional films and in a way he has. Shallow Grave was great, Life Less Ordinary was odd but very good, The Beach I found entertaining and very watch able as did 28 Days Later which is Boyle's most interesting film and then Trainspotting which comes after Shallow Grave really which is a film that follows the life of a small town Scottish lad trying to get through the days with his struggle of heroin with his outcast mates.

I'd have to warn there might be some SPOILERS ahead, if one can infer them from the comments.The movie is a two-sided affair one story deals with a traumatized cop (Bullock)and her partner. the other deals with two high school kids, justin and richard (the more interesting of the two stories, in my opinion). The story picks up and carries momentum throughout encounters and the overall plot that revolves around justin and richard,while seemingly lagging that momentum with the installment of Bullock's character's storyline in trying to create a two-dimensional plot between the cops and killers.Justin and richard's part in the movie,sure they have their flaws, but are the only parts of the movie worth watching. The closest Bullock's character comes to suspense would be her encounter with a baboon and shameless attempts to create mystery (auditory flashbacks).All in all, if you happen to come across this movie while switching through HBO or Cinemax, then I suggest you give it a try; personally, I wouldn't go out of my way for this movie, but that's just me.

Some believe it to be his masterpiece, while others find it mean-spirited and self-indulgent. Allen stars as Sandy Bates, a successful comedy film-maker who wants to branch out into more serious work and make a difference in the world, much to the horror of the studio, his staff and his fans. Attending a weekend-long festival of his work at a hotel, Bates attempts to sort out his relationships with the three women in his life, while dealing with his doubts about life and art and avoiding annoying and intrusive fans and critics.Heavily influenced by Federico Fellini, especially Eight and a Half, the film manages an interesting look at the pressures of celebrity. Interestingly, the crisis that Bates is going through in the film, in regards to his work, is similar to what Woody Allen was going through when this film was made. He was trying to break away from the style of films that had made him famous. The film passes, almost imperceptibly at times, between reality, memory, fantasy and scenes from Bates' films. Many fans were angered by the pretty savage portrayal of the fans in this film (though Woody Allen swore that this was not an accurate portrayal of how he saw his audience).The film is self-indulgent, but then so are many works of art, which is what this film definitely is. Beautifully photographed in black-and-white and very well acted by a talented cast and often very funny, the film also raises some very serious questions.You may find it very difficult to like Sandy Bates, or to really like the film, but it is worth watching at least once.Probably this is one of Woody Allen's most striking and memorable films.

Spoilers and Pseudo-Intellectual Claptrap followOn the surface it may seem like just an insensate piece of 70's Disney fluff, but the questions that this film raises are perhaps some of the most pertinent to understanding the nature of humanity itself.For instance When asked to write out a check to the mechanic, Annabel, in the body of her mother, opts to try to find cash instead, so as not to go to prison for forgery. But is this a rational fear? What are the legal precedents on matters of this nature? What is it that signs a check, the body or the mind? And, an even more intriguing question Whose signature would Annabel have while occupying her mother's body? Her own, or her mother's? After awhile, the signing of one's own name becomes a reflex, which does not require a conscious effort on the part of the brain, other than to set the pen in motion. And so it follows that Annabel would have her mother's signature while occupying her mother's body. And so, if it is Ellen Andrews' signature on the check, but Annabel Andrews who set the pen in motion to provide that signature... is that considered forgery, or not?Another question What, exactly, is it that has been switched? Their minds, of course. But what is the mind? It is the sum total of all one's knowledge and experience, which combines to form the basis of one's personality. However, genetics also play a part in the building blocks of personality, and each has found herself with a new genetic makeup which, though similar to one another, are not identical. What affect should this have on their respective personalities? Could it partly account for the sympathy that each acquires for the other's plight? And what about ingrained habits? It is established that Ellen smokes menthols, whereas Annabel dislikes being even in the vicinity of cigarettes. While in her mother's body, wouldn't Annabel experience that body's cigarette cravings? However, would Annabel's mind, the mind of a non-smoker, even be able to recognize those cravings for what they are?There is good evidence, however, that it is not their minds that switch places at all. The shot that communicates what has happened takes a split screen, with Annabel on one side and Ellen on the other, and freezes it. Then, pale silhouettes of each rise up and switch places with one another. This would seem to imply that it is, in fact, their souls that have traded places, and not their minds. This opens up a whole new batch of questions What IS the soul, and how does it differ from the mind? Is there something more that makes a person who they are than just genetics plus experiences? To what degree does the soul govern the body, and to what degree does the mind govern it? Do the two cooperate, or are they at odds? And then there is the question of physical abilities. Ellen is most likely not much of a sports person, and yet, in her body, Annabel is able to ride a skateboard and play baseball, presumably approximately as well as she did in her own body. But at the same time, Ellen, once she gets past her own mental blocks, is able to play field hockey nearly as well as Annabel in Annabel's body. Which is more important to success in a sport? The body, conditioned to play the sport, or the mind, trained to understand the game?This is where the soul comes into play. It is the determination of Ellen's soul that frees Annabel's body to begin playing actual hockey (rather than merely ducking the blows of the other team), even though Ellen's mind still does not really understand the game. And it is the longing of Annabel's soul for familiarity in a strange and relentless world that allows here to play baseball with her own abilities, even though Ellen's body would probably ordinarily not be up to the challenge.The philosophy becomes even more mind-bending with the climactic switch back Wherein rather than their souls returning again to their respective bodies, their bodies transcend the space time continuum to reunite with their rightful souls.

Spoilers and Pseudo-Intellectual Claptrap followOn the surface it may seem like just an insensate piece of 70's Disney fluff, but the questions that this film raises are perhaps some of the most pertinent to understanding the nature of humanity itself.For instance When asked to write out a check to the mechanic, Annabel, in the body of her mother, opts to try to find cash instead, so as not to go to prison for forgery. But is this a rational fear? What are the legal precedents on matters of this nature? What is it that signs a check, the body or the mind? And, an even more intriguing question Whose signature would Annabel have while occupying her mother's body? Her own, or her mother's? After awhile, the signing of one's own name becomes a reflex, which does not require a conscious effort on the part of the brain, other than to set the pen in motion. And so it follows that Annabel would have her mother's signature while occupying her mother's body. And so, if it is Ellen Andrews' signature on the check, but Annabel Andrews who set the pen in motion to provide that signature... is that considered forgery, or not?Another question What, exactly, is it that has been switched? Their minds, of course. But what is the mind? It is the sum total of all one's knowledge and experience, which combines to form the basis of one's personality. However, genetics also play a part in the building blocks of personality, and each has found herself with a new genetic makeup which, though similar to one another, are not identical. What affect should this have on their respective personalities? Could it partly account for the sympathy that each acquires for the other's plight? And what about ingrained habits? It is established that Ellen smokes menthols, whereas Annabel dislikes being even in the vicinity of cigarettes. While in her mother's body, wouldn't Annabel experience that body's cigarette cravings? However, would Annabel's mind, the mind of a non-smoker, even be able to recognize those cravings for what they are?There is good evidence, however, that it is not their minds that switch places at all. The shot that communicates what has happened takes a split screen, with Annabel on one side and Ellen on the other, and freezes it. Then, pale silhouettes of each rise up and switch places with one another. This would seem to imply that it is, in fact, their souls that have traded places, and not their minds. This opens up a whole new batch of questions What IS the soul, and how does it differ from the mind? Is there something more that makes a person who they are than just genetics plus experiences? To what degree does the soul govern the body, and to what degree does the mind govern it? Do the two cooperate, or are they at odds? And then there is the question of physical abilities. Ellen is most likely not much of a sports person, and yet, in her body, Annabel is able to ride a skateboard and play baseball, presumably approximately as well as she did in her own body. But at the same time, Ellen, once she gets past her own mental blocks, is able to play field hockey nearly as well as Annabel in Annabel's body. Which is more important to success in a sport? The body, conditioned to play the sport, or the mind, trained to understand the game?This is where the soul comes into play. It is the determination of Ellen's soul that frees Annabel's body to begin playing actual hockey (rather than merely ducking the blows of the other team), even though Ellen's mind still does not really understand the game. And it is the longing of Annabel's soul for familiarity in a strange and relentless world that allows here to play baseball with her own abilities, even though Ellen's body would probably ordinarily not be up to the challenge.The philosophy becomes even more mind-bending with the climactic switch back Wherein rather than their souls returning again to their respective bodies, their bodies transcend the space time continuum to reunite with their rightful souls. It is as if to say that the body and soul are so fundamentally intertwined that, when separated, the need for reunification is so great that it allows even for the transposition of corporeal flesh.Not to mention the Freudian issues involved in having a daughter married to her father, thus bringing the deep-seated Electra complex to glaring fruition.And so, in conclusion, I believe that the viewing of this movie can help us answer some of the questions asked by man since the beginning of time. If John Hinkley had chosen this film, rather than Taxi Driver, to be the fodder of his obsession with Ms. Jodie Foster, he would have been inspired to write an intelligent philosophical dissertation in order to impress her, rather than shoot Ronald Reagan.

It's definitely complex, entertaining in a disturbing way, and manages to be at once nihilistic and moralistic, not an easy trick, especially for a cowboy film.The first problem we have to deal with when watching this film is the fact there's very quickly a gunfight going on and, against all movie convention, no one to root for. There's an all-star cast on one side, including William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Ben Johnson, and Warren Oates, but against all expectation, they turn out to be a pretty black crew. About the first thing out of Holden's mouth, said about a cowed group of innocents, is If they move, kill 'em, and before the battle is over, we've seen him and his team commit all sorts of savagery. About the only reason we don't immediately see them as evil is that the people they battle are no better.Over time, we are encouraged to find something of value in Holden's Pike Bishop and his ruthless confederates, as they ride away, lick their wounds, and try to figure out how to get something else going, anything. The only problem is its 1913 and these outlaws are running out of time and options. I'd like to make one good score and back off, is how Pike says it, to which Borgnine's faithful buddy Dutch exclaims Back off to what?!Chasing the bunch, and offering the viewer the film's one sympathetic character, is Robert Ryan as Deke Thornton, a former partner of Pike's who doesn't want to go back to jail and for whom killing the bunch is the one unpleasant means of securing his freedom. Ryan, who died in 1973, is probably not as recognizable as the other leads today, but he lends a sad, elegiac presence to his on-screen moments that give the film much of its grace and warmth.The final star is director Sam Peckinpah, who made a truly revolutionary film that not only pushed the art of film forward but holds up today as a cinematic experience. Time has been kind to this film in a way it hasn't to other ground-breaking auteur moments from the same era, like MASH and Easy Rider. When The Wild Bunch came out just as the 1960s were ending, people were truly shocked by the violence and cruel characters. Today, of course, such things are so common, and so mindlessly celebrated, that we find ourselves admiring what Peckinpah does for the surprisingly subtle and restrained way he goes about presenting us with mayhem and carnage, and his refusal to glorify it, however exciting and entertaining the overall package.Surprisingly for a director who had trouble getting work at the time, Peckinpah landed three Oscar winners in the cast, and a fourth, Ben Johnson, who'd win his a couple of years later. Obviously, the acting is strong, each player investing his spare lines with the right degree of space and spirit, but it's probably worked even better that the movie game in 1969 was in the process of passing the fuddy-duddy likes of Holden, Borgnine, and Edmond O'Brien behind. This makes them very believable as a group of hard-nosed has-beens. In that light, it's kind of cool how hip this film so quickly became when it was released.It's such a good film it's easy to overlook minor weaknesses. There's a nice bit of symbolism in the beginning, now famous, where the gang rides past a group of children tormenting scorpions and ants, but the point, once made, is beaten into the ground. There are some bits of convenience that stick out, like when a gunned-down outlaw rises and mows down his attackers with a few too-precise shotgun blasts. The general dislikeability of just about everything and everybody does feel a bit of a weight after a couple of viewings.But what's great is just awesome, especially that opening sequence and the final showdown at Bloody Porch. Such terrific punch-drunk ambiance, it's almost a shame to watch it sober. The feeling of a new era coming upon us, which we see in everything from the doughboy uniforms at the outset to the car General Mapache rides around in, is redoubled by the glorious splendor, even clarity of this picture. Is it too much to praise a movie for the quality of the film stock itself? This is a paradox film, one about obsolescence and growing old that remains startling new-looking and fresh 35 years on.

The addition of Bushido proverbs in between scenes was terrible. They had no real bearing on the scenes that they connected(or separated)and some of them don't even sound authentic.(For better use of such proverbs see Kill Bill Vol.1).

The first thing most people will say in the movie's defense, is that the idea of a man living by a code of honor while all those around him have no such code is an apt commentary on modern social values and I agree. However that doesn't mean that the movie will be good. For example the fact that the little girl who witnessed Ghost dog's work first hand on 2 occasions turned out to be the crime boss who ordered him killed is just plain stupid. Second, the dialogue was pointless. Third, the rough assassin making friends with a young child has been done many time before(and for anyone who has seen Leon or the American version The Professional its been done a lot better). The addition of Bushido proverbs in between scenes was terrible.

Did somebody actually take the time to sew this poor guys head back on?. Like in the first film, once the gas is out in the open, it spreads over the local cemetery, awakening a throng of rotted cadavers that have definitely been out of the freezer for far to long!, Once free from their graves, they go into a new small town development project & munch on human brains! While a small group of people set out to destroy them before they too join the stiffs! RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD II, although nowhere near as good as the original Dan O'Bannon directed first film, is still plenty entertaining. Director KEN WIEDRHORN'S script is full of humour & that's all properly displayed here, since just like in the original, the casting directors were able to find some very good acting talent, with each actor making their roles very believable & interesting & not only that, the actors are also able to deliver on the jokes in the script just perfectly. The zombie make-up is beyond disgusting, as we see an army of badly decomposing corpses roam about & eating the brains of the unwary. I'm not sure what the budget was for the film, but if anything it looks to be higher than that of the original film, simply because there are more close ups of the zombie make- up & costumes than what the original exhibited. Returning cast members THOM MATHEWS & JAMES KAREN (Along with JONOTHAN TERRY returning as COL. GLOVER & BRIAN PECK returning to play a series of zombies) are once again re-teamed with each other & as in the original, their chemistry really works, these guys are hilarious & make one of the best (but sadly) unrecognizable comedy duo in the history of cinema! MICHAEL KENWORTHY (What ever happened to this kid anyways?) MARSHA DIELTEN, SUZANNE SNYDER, DANA ASHBROOK & the late PHILIP BRUNS, all turn in great performances & the kid playing the lead bully turned zombie, is perfectly cast in the part & makes for a good villain. If anything it could be argued that while the film is not as good as the first, it is indeed funnier, the original's humour came from it's story & how it's characters dealt with a real zombie invasion, as opposed to the ones they seen in the Romero zombie films, as they quickly found out that the rules on how to kill a zombie, established by Romero, sadly doesn't work on these zombies. The jokes are all told in funny situations & one liners. Perhaps the best moment comes from when JAMES KAREN & THOM MATHEWS (who's dressed to look like Marty Mcfly from BACK TO THE FUTURE!) are sitting down to eat in a mausoleum, after some grave robbing, with Karen warning Mathews to watch his tongue if he likes the job he is currently doing, & Thom gets upset, Like this job! Like this job... I mean it was funny when it was said in the original, but here it's extra funny, simply because in the first, both men had an ordinary job, but here, their stealing body parts & jewelry! Other humorous bits are derived from an badly decaying female EDDIE MURPHYeseque talking severed head, that despite being dead, still retains it's sense of humour & the MICHAEL JACKSON THRILLER ZOMBIE was hilarious! Another thing I liked that they carried over from the first is the fact that the z ombies all have personalities, unlike most zombie flicks, you really believe that these stiffs were really alive at one time. At one point Director Weiderhorn seems to be making a comment on weather or not there's an afterlife or just dying & being re-incarnated as someone else, especially in a scene where Karen & Mathews are driving along in the car & Mathews explaining the feeling he has, that what their going through feels strangely familiar, like they had been there before, both of being sick & as zombies roaming about, but such a case is not really made clear as it is never mentioned or referenced within the context of the rest of the film & despite it's comedy tone, Director Ken Weiderhorn is able to establish some pretty key effective scenes & jump scares, along with a modicum of suspense & better yet, Wiedrhorn never slows down, as his script always as something going on, both funny, gooey, suspenseful, action packed & horrific. Despite the fact that the original played heavy on the violence, Weiderhorn seems to shy away from heavy violence, true the film has violence in it, but it's mostly committed against the rotting stiffs who have various arms, legs, head ripped off or have the zombies faces literally punched in or their eyes & jaws extracted from their bodies (Don't watch this during dinner or after...) Highly recommended to all zombie fans, especially fans of the first, just don't expect it to top the first film & you should find yourself being mildly entertained. Beware the DVD version released by WARNER BROS. they have added dialogue, some of which plays out of sync with the actors! & the original soundtrack has been stripped from the film & replaced by a horrible sounding score & a somewhat interesting narration, a different rock soundtrack used during the closing credits (Which I admit, I liked better than Monster Mash) Stick with the VHS version if you still have a VCR & can find a copy.
