The best part of this film is the continous satire of the New York artworld, almost definitely inspired by John Water's early career in themovies and his later career being a photographer. For example,back in the sixties, he would play his short films at small cafes inBaltimore just like Pecker showed his artwork in the sub shop.Also, the opening credits which are somewhat shaky are inspiredby the fact that when John showed his early films, the projectorwould always shake and make the picture move.

This story of the smart little guy and the very dumb big guy, set against the backdrop of the California of the Depression period, has all the makings of a classic, yet somehow it falls a little short. Not by a million miles, but there are problems with it, especially where the Steinbeck-as-biologist philosophy of life comes into play, and we realize that the author, for all his compassion and love for living things, also views all animals as the same. Men and dogs, rabbits and mice, are equally worthwhile in his view, and he continually (and the script is sedulous to a fault in this regard) emphasizes this here and elsewhere in his writings, and the result is a kind of pantheistic regard for everything that lives, which is wonderful and idealistic, but alas impractical. It's also bad psychology. The continual parallels between, for instance, big stupid Lenny and Candy's sick old dog, which might work in a purely poetic context, seem too manufactured for drama. Steinbeck shows here and there a great latent insight into the human condition in general; his empathy his real, and one truly senses that he at times truly loves his characters; but when it comes to particulars he falls down, and in the end has little to say. The human condition interests him alright, but people are almost interchangeable in his world, but for their size or brains, and their inner lives hold no interest for him.The movie, once one accepts the limits imposed on it by the book, is a fine piece of work. I wish that John Ford could have had a crack at this, yet director Lewis Milestone does an excellent job with the material; he is at all times sensitive and observant, letting each actor strut his stuff. His feeling for nature, so central to the book, is not so great, yet this could have been imposed on him by budgetary restraints. Producer Hal Roach was a notorious skinflint. Lon Chaney, Jr. as Lennie is excellent. I wish that the character had been fleshed out more. He's almost too good to be true. The only harm he does others comes from his not knowing his own strength. Fair enough. Yet at times he seems too saintly. The mentally impaired can be lovable, as indeed Lennie is in many ways, but even they have bad hair days, and I wish that just for once Lennie had showed a petty or venal side. When he defies George, his keeper, he always feels contrite in the end. For once it would have been nice for him to have done a bad thing, not told George about it, just for kicks, and felt good as a result of his little rebellion. But this would have revealed Lennie an an authentic, evolving, genuine human being, and Steinbeck wasn't interested in this, so Lennie remains a symbol. It is to Chaney's great credit that he never seems like one.Burgess Meredith, as the brainy little George, looks out of place among the rugged ranch-workers. He was an inherently urban type, and though he could play small-town midwesterners with great relish at times, there was always that impish glint in his eye that suggested that he knew much, much more about life than his character did. In this film he is quite young and rather delicate looking, and while one can imagine that Lennie would admire him for his brains, he has no air of authority about him, no real life gravitas to ground him in reality. He basically comes off like what he is a finely trained classical actor essaying a modern role. That there's no trace of chemistry between Meredith and Chaney is a serious flaw in the film.In smaller roles, Roman Bohnen and Charles Bickford do solid work, the former especially has a lot of emoting to do, and is very credible. As the bored ranchwife Mae, Betty Field does not give her best performance. This fine stage actress had yet to learn to act for the camera. Only in her final scene with Lennie does she come to life; sadly, it's too late. Leigh Whipper as Crooks, the black man who can't stay in the bunkhouse with the rest, shows a nicely malevolent side, and comes near to creating the one fully-rounded character in the film, but goes sentimental in the end. Too bad. Cowboy actor Bob Steele brings a nice touch of the Old West to the swaggering Curly, and I wish that he, rather, than Meredith, had been cast as George.Aaron Copland's music is used intelligently, and its soaring near the end seems appropriate to the effect the film was trying to create, which was one of tragic humanity rather than tragic human beings. Meredith rises to the occasion when the dialogue goes poetic, redeeming himself somewhat in the process. The best things in the movie are incidental, such as the ongoing fantasy George and Lennie share about buying a little farmhouse for themselves, where no one can tell them what to do, and if they want to go to the circus there's no boss around to tell them otherwise. When Candy joins in and becomes a partner in their little dreamworld the film begins to hum, and one wishes that in these moments it could have gone off-track and become another movie altogether, about little guys finding a place for themselves in the world. But Steinbeck was hunting bigger game than this, and the tragedy he imposed on the story, while believable enough, is an awful letdown, for the viewer as much as for George.

Having viewed this 1957 film during its first U.S. release in 1959, when I was 21 years-old, it was quite involving to return to it 43 years later. Like the Professor of the story, I too often reflect upon choice made along lifes path and wonder what might have been if different choices had been made. Victor Sjostron as Proffesor Isak Borg gives the performance of a life-time! What a magnificent face this man had! Bergman films can be quite dark and depressing, but his THE SEVENTH SEAL and WILD STRAWBERRIES are marvelous, thought-provoking dramas that lift the spirit. BEWARE There are two other DVD releases, one from Asia and one from Brazil -- but neither of these have been cleaned up like the Criterion version. The sound for instance -- I have seen the dream sequence at the beginning of the film when the Professor walks through empty streets, sees handless clocks, a carriage carrying a casket with his body -- a scene with almost complete silence,BUT prints on 16mm, VHS and even Laser Disc all contain a great deal of surface noise. In the Criterion version, the silence is almost complete. And the picture is perfection -- blacks & whites that sparkle and no film blemishes or dirt-- a picture that is a wonder to behold. Peter Cowie's Commentary is outstanding and very worth while. The 90 Documentary from Swedish Television, INGMAR BERGMAN ON LIFE AND WORK is quite fascinating. Bergman, then in his early 80's, is very articulate and thoughtful in his discussion. Over the years Bergman has come to the conclusion that when we die we are no more -- and he has stated that conclusion gives him great peace. BUT his conversation in this documentary puts a wrinkle in his conclusion. He speaks of his final marriage to a woman for over 20 years and of her passing. He can not believe that SHE does not exist anymore. He often has the feeling that she is near him and that she still influences decisions he makes. He can accept not being for himself but not for her. Bergman is getting closer to the truth then he realizes. . . death is not the end -- but only the beginning. When he finally passes from this early life and finds that he still is -- I wonder if he'll wish he could change the focus of his later film work. Be that as it may -- WILD STRAWBERRIES and THE SEVENTH SEAL are two of the finest films of the last century -- in my humble opinion.

Bergman, then in his early 80's, is very articulate and thoughtful in his discussion. Over the years Bergman has come to the conclusion that when we die we are no more -- and he has stated that conclusion gives him great peace. BUT his conversation in this documentary puts a wrinkle in his conclusion. He speaks of his final marriage to a woman for over 20 years and of her passing. He can not believe that SHE does not exist anymore. He often has the feeling that she is near him and that she still influences decisions he makes. He can accept not being for himself but not for her. Bergman is getting closer to the truth then he realizes. . . death is not the end -- but only the beginning.

Picture, sound and English Subtitles have never been as fine as seen here. Having viewed this 1957 film during its first U.S. release in 1959, when I was 21 years-old, it was quite involving to return to it 43 years later. Like the Professor of the story, I too often reflect upon choice made along lifes path and wonder what might have been if different choices had been made. Victor Sjostron as Proffesor Isak Borg gives the performance of a life-time! What a magnificent face this man had! Bergman films can be quite dark and depressing, but his THE SEVENTH SEAL and WILD STRAWBERRIES are marvelous, thought-provoking dramas that lift the spirit. BEWARE There are two other DVD releases, one from Asia and one from Brazil -- but neither of these have been cleaned up like the Criterion version. The sound for instance -- I have seen the dream sequence at the beginning of the film when the Professor walks through empty streets, sees handless clocks, a carriage carrying a casket with his body -- a scene with almost complete silence,BUT prints on 16mm, VHS and even Laser Disc all contain a great deal of surface noise.

They're as normal as every other human being around, except for one difference Dave is deaf and Wally is blind. They meet one day when Wally looks, or rather seeks, a job at Dave's news stand. Their encounter doesn't go too well but is quite hilarious. Wally invites Dave to meet a friend of his, Harvey Wallbanger. So at the bar, a fight ensues.                The next day, there was a murder at the news stand. Wally heard it and Dave saw it, almost. But when the cops show up, they figure Dave and Wally are the killers and take them into custody. The surly Captain Braddock tries to interrogate them but isn't too successful. The real killers, Kirgo and Eve, act as Wally and Dave's attorney. They recognize them immediately but Braddock doesn't believe them, so they must escape or face real trouble. So they escape and snatch a patrol car. Only problem Wally was driving. They end up on a garbage boat bound for New Jersey.                They immediately recuperate and seek help from Wally's sister, Adele. They try and catch the killers in a hotel by using aliases.

Wally and Dave come to the rescue and meet the head boss behind it all Mr. Sutherland, who is blind like Wally.

If you're just a Richard Pryor fan, I recommend Moving or The Toy. If you're just a Gene Wilder fan, I recommend Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Blazing Saddles, or Young Frankenstein.  But which ever you are, don't forget to see See No Evil, Hear No Evil. I like the part when Dave is getting his picture taken in jail, but he can't hear the camera woman so he keeps turning his head. He did it right when the picture was taken so she walked out of the room yelling the S-word.

As the standard Western heroes - John Wayne, James Stewart, Henry Fonda, Burt Lancaster, Gary Cooper - either died or got too old for their parts, only a few Italian Westerns and an occasional Eastwood one (though he went nine years between The Outlaw Josey Wales and Pale Rider - and seven between the latter and this) kept the genre alive.  Then, in the early 1990's, two classic Westerns briefly breathed new life into the Western, before it continued to decline (or just died).  Neither were conventional.   The first, Dances With Wolves, is the first.  Second only to Leone's Once Upon A Time In The West, it turns around the standard John Ford theme of good white and black guys\/bad Indians (as Ford himself did in Cheyenne Autumn, his last Western).  Even though Kevin Costner has become one of the most egotistical and hated directors\/producers\/stars (though I still like him, in spite of 3000 Miles to Graceland), this film (his directoral debut) was a classic film in every sense of the words.  This one, however, was a little different.   Eastwood always knew that he owed his career to Leone (and Don Sigel), and dedicated his Oscar(s) to the twosome.  Most of his Westerns (High Plains Drifter, The Outlaw Josey Wales, Pale Rider) are spin-offs of his infamous Man With No Name.  And yet, nothing could compare to this, his magnum opus.  Screw The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly and Dirty Harry this is Eastwood's best.   The death-kneel for the Western, Unforgiven takes many Western cliches - the veteran gunslinger, the kid who's all talk, brutal and corrupt lawmen, the whores - and turns them inside out.  Will Munny is at first very likeable as a (somewhat) reformed gunslinger; however, towards, the end, as he rumbles towards the inevitable showdown with Sheriff Little Bill Dagget (the Oscar-winning Hackman), he resorts to his merciless, cruel, drunken self of old.  His one friend, Ned Logan (an outstanding Freeman) is dead; the other, the all-talk, no-guts, half-blind Schofield Kid (a suprisingly good Woolvett) refuses to continue the mission after killing one of the criminals.  So it's Munny against Dagget and his deputies.   The violence is portrayed very realistically; there's actually little violence (and only minimal shootouts); the whore being cut up; English Bob (a likeable Harris) being roughed up by Hackman; Freeman being the same; the death of the two cowboys (including the cowboy being shot on the toilet, which in any other film would've been a stupid sight gag); and of course, the final confrontation.     With a cast that includes Eastwood, Hackman, Woolvett, Logan, Harris, Frances Fisher (Titanic), character actor Saul Rubineck, and many less famous faces.   There is little more I can add to the comments on this film.  Bravo, Clint.   Ten stars.

Of course, a film that approaches mankind's most momentous questions in such an audacious manner becomes an instant magnet for criticism.  Complaints like `slow', `dull', `doesn't make sense', `unimaginative', `emotionless', and even `dated' are repeatedly used by frustrated viewers who, for whatever reason, are unable to immerse themselves into Kubrick's magnum opus, but none of them really seem to fit.  For me, `2001' is a truly flawless work of art.At the center of the film is the monolith a polished, black rectangle, planted by a superior form of life in order to progress the evolution of mankind.  Yet, strangely enough, a large portion of the movie deals with a battle between man and machine.  It seems perplexing at first, given how little it has to do with the key story-line, but the extended sub-plot not only gives the film a conflict - one which brings along feelings of tension, fear, and pity, among other things - but helps to comment on the movie's many themes most notably, man's rapid advancement of technology.`2001' is split into four chapters.  The first of which, `The Dawn of Man', recounts man's evolution from man-ape into man.  It opens with incredible imagery, which seems to tell the history of earth.  It shows a world without cement, buildings, cars, and pollution.  After apes inhabit the world, the helpless, inane creatures come into contact with the monolith, which helps them to develop a sense of curiosity and the discovery of `tools.  The famous jump-cut, in which an ape-man tosses his newfound tool into the air, brings us either to 1999 or 2000, where man's tools have given them the ability to travel through space.After a dazzling ballet of floating ships, set to Strauss's `The Blue Danube', we find that our new protagonist, Dr. Heywood Floyd, is heading to the moon for reasons he cannot discuss.  Floyd's harrowing discussion with Russian scientists (in an eerie white room with red\/orange chairs) hints that his mission is rather important, and therefore, confidential.  He learns of a monolith having been dug up on the moon, one that points to Jupiter and reacts with a sort of `burglar alarm', reporting to the extraterrestrials that man has reached the next rung on the ladder to becoming a superior life force.The lengthy third section, `Jupiter Mission', brings in the aforementioned sub-plot concerning HAL 9000, a self-proclaimed, `foolproof and incapable of error' computer entity with the capability to `mimic' human emotions. HAL's ability to mimic ultimately leads to his downfall, when he makes an incorrect judgement on the failure of another ship part.  Overwhelmed by his massive duties on the ship, his fault leads to his own incapability to comprehend his fallibility.  The ships crew members, headed on a mission which is kept secret to them, are killed off by the computer, leading the one remaining survivor to outwit the computer and `unplug' him.  Upon reaching Jupiter space, he learns about the nature of his mission.The final segment, `Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite', depicts events beyond human comprehension.  The survivor, David Bowman, is sucked into a stargate by the superior life form.  When he reaches the destination, he is kept in a `human zoo', mapped out of images in his subconscious.  He is then evolved into a greater being, one made purely of energy and soul.Words cannot possibly depict how I feel towards this movie.  I've seen it over 25 times in the last year, and I find myself as overwhelmed by its beauty and power as ever.  Every frame is beautiful, every choice of sound and music is impeccable.  To experience the opening images of `Jupiter Mission' with the wonderfully melancholic `Gayne Ballet Suite' in the background, or the moment in which Bowman's objective is explained to him by Floyd on the blue screen, fading with the words, `its origin and purpose still a total mystery' is to have a mild feeling of euphoria.  It would be pointless for me to list more breathtaking moments, they must be seen and appreciated on their own.In regard to the popular criticism of the film being `boring', this most likely depends on the viewer's attention span. The slowest of moments remain so visually stunning that I still can't take my eyes off the screen.  I wouldn't remove a second of the film, because there is a purpose behind all of it.  `Tedious' is often used to describe a sequence in which Bowman takes his space pod out to retrieve a part of the ship that is supposedly malfunctioning.  It can be rather tedious, and it often triggers one's mind to wander, but it actually creates a feeling of routine and comfort within the viewer.  A short time later, Bowman's assistant Frank Poole performs the similar task of attaching the ship unit back where it was.  Identical feelings of routine and boredom begin to set in, but this time, Kubrick disrupts it.  We see the pod turn around (under HAL's control) and cut Frank's oxygen cord.  The tension built up during this moment is worth every millisecond of tedium in the previous sequence.  Kubrick does something similar in `The Shining', using two scenes of a child riding a tricycle. The first creates routine, the second disrupts it.  One of the director's many ingenius filmmaking tactics.I could discuss the many themes, allegories, and insights towards this greatest of films, but that should be left for the viewer to experience. Besides, I'm running dangerously close to the 1,000 word mark.

He learns of a monolith having been dug up on the moon, one that points to Jupiter and reacts with a sort of `burglar alarm', reporting to the extraterrestrials that man has reached the next rung on the ladder to becoming a superior life force.The lengthy third section, `Jupiter Mission', brings in the aforementioned sub-plot concerning HAL 9000, a self-proclaimed, `foolproof and incapable of error' computer entity with the capability to `mimic' human emotions. HAL's ability to mimic ultimately leads to his downfall, when he makes an incorrect judgement on the failure of another ship part.  Overwhelmed by his massive duties on the ship, his fault leads to his own incapability to comprehend his fallibility.  The ships crew members, headed on a mission which is kept secret to them, are killed off by the computer, leading the one remaining survivor to outwit the computer and `unplug' him.  Upon reaching Jupiter space, he learns about the nature of his mission.The final segment, `Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite', depicts events beyond human comprehension.  The survivor, David Bowman, is sucked into a stargate by the superior life form.  When he reaches the destination, he is kept in a `human zoo', mapped out of images in his subconscious.  He is then evolved into a greater being, one made purely of energy and soul.Words cannot possibly depict how I feel towards this movie.  I've seen it over 25 times in the last year, and I find myself as overwhelmed by its beauty and power as ever.  Every frame is beautiful, every choice of sound and music is impeccable.  To experience the opening images of `Jupiter Mission' with the wonderfully melancholic `Gayne Ballet Suite' in the background, or the moment in which Bowman's objective is explained to him by Floyd on the blue screen, fading with the words, `its origin and purpose still a total mystery' is to have a mild feeling of euphoria.  It would be pointless for me to list more breathtaking moments, they must be seen and appreciated on their own.In regard to the popular criticism of the film being `boring', this most likely depends on the viewer's attention span. The slowest of moments remain so visually stunning that I still can't take my eyes off the screen.  I wouldn't remove a second of the film, because there is a purpose behind all of it.  `Tedious' is often used to describe a sequence in which Bowman takes his space pod out to retrieve a part of the ship that is supposedly malfunctioning.  It can be rather tedious, and it often triggers one's mind to wander, but it actually creates a feeling of routine and comfort within the viewer.  A short time later, Bowman's assistant Frank Poole performs the similar task of attaching the ship unit back where it was.  Identical feelings of routine and boredom begin to set in, but this time, Kubrick disrupts it.  We see the pod turn around (under HAL's control) and cut Frank's oxygen cord.  The tension built up during this moment is worth every millisecond of tedium in the previous sequence.  Kubrick does something similar in `The Shining', using two scenes of a child riding a tricycle. The first creates routine, the second disrupts it.  One of the director's many ingenius filmmaking tactics.I could discuss the many themes, allegories, and insights towards this greatest of films, but that should be left for the viewer to experience. Besides, I'm running dangerously close to the 1,000 word mark.

Of course, a film that approaches mankind's most momentous questions in such an audacious manner becomes an instant magnet for criticism.  Complaints like `slow', `dull', `doesn't make sense', `unimaginative', `emotionless', and even `dated' are repeatedly used by frustrated viewers who, for whatever reason, are unable to immerse themselves into Kubrick's magnum opus, but none of them really seem to fit.  For me, `2001' is a truly flawless work of art.At the center of the film is the monolith a polished, black rectangle, planted by a superior form of life in order to progress the evolution of mankind.  Yet, strangely enough, a large portion of the movie deals with a battle between man and machine.  It seems perplexing at first, given how little it has to do with the key story-line, but the extended sub-plot not only gives the film a conflict - one which brings along feelings of tension, fear, and pity, among other things - but helps to comment on the movie's many themes most notably, man's rapid advancement of technology.`2001' is split into four chapters.  The first of which, `The Dawn of Man', recounts man's evolution from man-ape into man.  It opens with incredible imagery, which seems to tell the history of earth.  It shows a world without cement, buildings, cars, and pollution.  After apes inhabit the world, the helpless, inane creatures come into contact with the monolith, which helps them to develop a sense of curiosity and the discovery of `tools.  The famous jump-cut, in which an ape-man tosses his newfound tool into the air, brings us either to 1999 or 2000, where man's tools have given them the ability to travel through space.After a dazzling ballet of floating ships, set to Strauss's `The Blue Danube', we find that our new protagonist, Dr. Heywood Floyd, is heading to the moon for reasons he cannot discuss.

The wide array of emotions that the viewer is taken through gives immense entertainment value to it. The style with which the story is delivered adds to that value and earns it the title of art.The storyline itself is an unusual and remarkable chronicle of events, but the dialogues, setting and characters are portrayed in a non-glamorous, everyday manner. Take for instance the scene in which Derek (Edward Norton) has come home for the first time. Amidst the setting, a small two bedroom flat, Derek's family look genuinely at home. Watching this scene feels somehow peculiar as though you really are snooping in someone's private life, not some kind of &#145;At Home With the Vinyards' reality show, but actually as though you are there in some sense. As all the events unfold around you this strange cinematic reality helps to absorb you a little more into the plot, with the ultimate aim that it shares with any story - to make you forget (at least for the duration) that these things didn't really happen.I believe the idea of this film was not only to give the viewer something to keep them entertained for two hours but also to inform, warn or educate the viewing masses. In a manner to try and make some kind of sense of that which drives the Neo Nazi. As the characters go through their development the key issues that give rise to the irrational hatred of racism and the reasoning that people build to support it are illustrated with a series of bullet-point plot events. We are presented with various different 'flavours' of hatred, and various different classes of racist.In this film the subject of all kinds of prejudice has been laid out on a public operating table and thoroughly dissected, so that anyone may see what drives the beast. What makes some Humans feel such an intense and unfounded dislike to their fellow man? Whilst it is by no means an exhaustive examination it is detailed and vast in nature, and is an element of the film pivotal to its success.The performances in American History X also make the final ingredient for our Really Good Movie Cake Mix. There are some excellent Actors in this cast, but in reality the story only has room for two strong performances, and whilst the supporting roles were on the whole excellently played, they were all simply outshone by Norton and Furlong.I have previously seen only 2 of Norton's leads, the Score and Fight Club. Each and every one of these 3 roles demands a completely different performance from this immensely talented actor, and I cannot fault the manner in which he has risen to the challenge on every occasion here we see a tremendous progression in his character which, despite receiving certain criticisms elsewhere, I believe to have been portrayed flawlessly, which is certainly supported by the fact that when the awards ceremonies came round the following year, Norton was the only man to be holding the awards (Golden Satellite and SEFCA) even against tough competition in that year.Edward Furlong could not have possibly improved his performance as Derek's younger brother Danny from start to finish. Although it may be true that the film takes a while to find its feet and the better scenes are mostly at the end, there was something about Furlong's performance that shone through even in the opening minutes. He manages to show the sensitivity and intellectual properties of the otherwise boisterous and angry character at just the right levels.Notable supporting roles come from Ethan Suplee as Seth and Avery Brooks as Sweeney. Ethan has enjoyed fame comedy roles (Particularly throughout the Kevin Smith Films) but here he demonstrates his acting talents in a *slightly* more serious role, I say slightly because despite the dark nature of his character you can't help but grin at some of the more socially impaired qualities of his role. He portrays the typicalMost people will know Avery Brooks from his long standing role as Captain Sisko, a role which requires similar traits to that of Sweeney, it might be because of this that his performance comes off strangely natural when you watch him initially, but on more careful deliberation he seems too wooden in the role, although this is probably partly the fault of the script. Sweeney is a Teacher, with 2 PhD's under his cap, so why is he not teaching at a better college? The character does come across with a certain attitude of wanting to be helping where he can help most, but this good natured quality, even coupled with his caring and compassionate still don't excuse his presence in this college, his position seems to be below him. Sweeney is also as a some sort of Obi-Wan-Kenobi imparting pearls of wisdom at seemingly appropriate times and conveniently saving a lot of time by explaining other events with a few lines instead of requiring a couple of scenes.All in all American History X is the film maker's way of saying `Why can't we all just get along?' but this film does it with a gun pressed to your temple. The touch subject matter has been carefully considered and then attacked full on, and I must say it works. Although within the first twenty minutes of this film I thought I hadn't seen anything but a glorification of violence and prejudice, it takes the whole film before you see the whole picture (pardon the pun), the grand concept that makes this film more than mere entertainment, it is art.08\/10-x-  ","genre":null},{"date":"15 August 2002","score":"","review":"  American History X is in my mind both art and entertainment.

I know that there's nothing I can say to improve its reputation, or to make it any more well-loved. All I can attest to is the fact that I had the chance to see this film for the first time today, and just couldn't help falling in love with it. It's as close to perfect as a romance film could get, with elements of war, action, suspense, and good old-fashioned friendship thrown in to spice things up a little.(Summary contains spoilers, beware!) It's war-time, and Casablanca is en route to America and freedom. Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), cynical and crusty owner of Cafe Americain, hides a softer, wounded side beneath his tough exterior. He says many times that he's never going to stick his neck out for anyone, that it's a policy of his not to drink with people in his cafe--all things that change when Isla (Ingrid Bergman) comes back into his life, unfortunately accompanied by her husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). Victor is a top man in the resistance movement, and needs desperately to escape to America to continue his fight for freedom. CASABLANCA isn't all about politics, however. It really comes down to the love of Rick for Ilsa, whom he met for a heady love affair in Paris, all set to the tune of 'As Time Goes By' (surely one of the most beautiful and memorable love songs ever written). His choice is the most difficult one anyone could ever be expected to make, and what's good about the film is that it keeps the audience guessing, even to the end, about just what Rick will do with the power he has over the fate of Ilsa, and most importantly, Victor (and as the film would have us believe, the free world!). I dare your heart not to break when Rick tells Ilsa, as he so famously does, Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. And then one realises just what war can do to people, and what people can do in spite of war.It's a fantastic film to be discovering for the first time, since the directing, acting and script are all first-rate. Michael Curtiz pulls the entire film together beautifully, drawing an incredible performance from Humphrey Bogart (perhaps the only actor--aside from Spencer Tracy--who could come off as so apparently self-centred and cynical and yet reveal a believably vulnerable side) and capturing Ingrid Bergman in all her luminous beauty.

I know that there's nothing I can say to improve its reputation, or to make it any more well-loved. All I can attest to is the fact that I had the chance to see this film for the first time today, and just couldn't help falling in love with it. It's as close to perfect as a romance film could get, with elements of war, action, suspense, and good old-fashioned friendship thrown in to spice things up a little.(Summary contains spoilers, beware!) It's war-time, and Casablanca is en route to America and freedom. Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), cynical and crusty owner of Cafe Americain, hides a softer, wounded side beneath his tough exterior. He says many times that he's never going to stick his neck out for anyone, that it's a policy of his not to drink with people in his cafe--all things that change when Isla (Ingrid Bergman) comes back into his life, unfortunately accompanied by her husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). Victor is a top man in the resistance movement, and needs desperately to escape to America to continue his fight for freedom. CASABLANCA isn't all about politics, however. It really comes down to the love of Rick for Ilsa, whom he met for a heady love affair in Paris, all set to the tune of 'As Time Goes By' (surely one of the most beautiful and memorable love songs ever written). His choice is the most difficult one anyone could ever be expected to make, and what's good about the film is that it keeps the audience guessing, even to the end, about just what Rick will do with the power he has over the fate of Ilsa, and most importantly, Victor (and as the film would have us believe, the free world!). I dare your heart not to break when Rick tells Ilsa, as he so famously does, Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. And then one realises just what war can do to people, and what people can do in spite of war.It's a fantastic film to be discovering for the first time, since the directing, acting and script are all first-rate. Michael Curtiz pulls the entire film together beautifully, drawing an incredible performance from Humphrey Bogart (perhaps the only actor--aside from Spencer Tracy--who could come off as so apparently self-centred and cynical and yet reveal a believably vulnerable side) and capturing Ingrid Bergman in all her luminous beauty.

Take for example, Coca-Cola.  The format has stayed the same for decades, and has been very successful.  Others try and imitate it, use similar ingredients, maybe even the same measurements, and although they may come close, they JUST don't quite get it exactly the same, and it doesn't taste the same.  But eventually, someone will take that formula, and improve upon it&#133; and no I'm not talking about `New Coke'&#133; but something completely different.Let's look at the basic formula for a typical James Bond type flick&#133; the ingredients being an international spy&#133; a villain with a blatant foreign accent hell-bent on world domination and\/or destruction&#133; an array of neat gadgets for our hero, as well as a hot-fast car&#133; and of course, the beautiful woman.  Take those elements and pit the spy into coming into close contact of our villain, wanting to covertly undermine his ploy, but eventually wind up blowing-up everything thing in sight, saving his own neck from capture (as well as the beautiful woman's) while ensuring, at the last minute, that the villains plans are thwarted.XXX is a movie that takes these basic elements, and the basic Bond formula, and cranks the volume on it up to 11. (As if the soundtrack in the opening sequence alone isn't evidence enough of that)  The high-impulse action begins with the opening scene, and doesn't stop until the story is finished.  In fact, the action filled scenes get more intense as the movie rolls on. Vin Diesel plays Xander Cage, an X-Sports athlete whose internet videos have made him an underground star.  Problem is, he takes his extreme-lifestyle too far too often, and is a wanted man.  The NSA needs a man just like &#145;X' (as he prefers to be called) for their lucrative assignment&#133; and so it goes.The story, as I've hinted already, follows a basic Bond formula, but that's not to the films discredit.  It's simply taking a formula, which apparently works very well, and cranks it up a few notches&#133; especially in the action department.Where XXX differs from the Bond movies, is primarily in the main character.  Bond is a sophisticated, well respected, well refined agent, flashing high-class clothes and cars with a certain sophistication.   Xander Cage, on the other hand, is a rebel&#133; the antithesis of a Bond character in almost every way.  He's a bit too sure of himself, a bit cocky, and definitely has an attitude.  This is exactly the type of character needed to pull off an action film of this magnitude.  Someone who lives their life on the edge and as &#145;X' says himself, someone who `lives for this s__t.'XXX has some of the biggest action sequences I've seen in recent years.  One scene in particular could only have been improved if it had been mastered for IMAX presentation.  This is a real thrill ride.  By far the best action film this year and definitely well worth seeing on the big screen.  It will be one I plan on returning to see again this summer for sure.

Take those elements and pit the spy into coming into close contact of our villain, wanting to covertly undermine his ploy, but eventually wind up blowing-up everything thing in sight, saving his own neck from capture (as well as the beautiful woman's) while ensuring, at the last minute, that the villains plans are thwarted.XXX is a movie that takes these basic elements, and the basic Bond formula, and cranks the volume on it up to 11. (As if the soundtrack in the opening sequence alone isn't evidence enough of that)  The high-impulse action begins with the opening scene, and doesn't stop until the story is finished.  In fact, the action filled scenes get more intense as the movie rolls on. Vin Diesel plays Xander Cage, an X-Sports athlete whose internet videos have made him an underground star.  Problem is, he takes his extreme-lifestyle too far too often, and is a wanted man.  The NSA needs a man just like &#145;X' (as he prefers to be called) for their lucrative assignment&#133; and so it goes.The story, as I've hinted already, follows a basic Bond formula, but that's not to the films discredit.  It's simply taking a formula, which apparently works very well, and cranks it up a few notches&#133; especially in the action department.Where XXX differs from the Bond movies, is primarily in the main character.  Bond is a sophisticated, well respected, well refined agent, flashing high-class clothes and cars with a certain sophistication.   Xander Cage, on the other hand, is a rebel&#133; the antithesis of a Bond character in almost every way.  He's a bit too sure of himself, a bit cocky, and definitely has an attitude.  This is exactly the type of character needed to pull off an action film of this magnitude.  Someone who lives their life on the edge and as &#145;X' says himself, someone who `lives for this s__t.'XXX has some of the biggest action sequences I've seen in recent years.  One scene in particular could only have been improved if it had been mastered for IMAX presentation.  This is a real thrill ride.  By far the best action film this year and definitely well worth seeing on the big screen.  It will be one I plan on returning to see again this summer for sure.

","genre":"Action, Adventure"},{"date":"15 August 2002","score":"","review":"  *Spoiler Alert*The main review on the front of the DVD says ...scary As Hell! Nothing could be farther from the truth. This movie has some excellent special effect, and the cinematography is supberb, but if you have seen Event Horizon, Sleepy Hollow, What Lies Beneath, etc. than this will be all about a great movie and no suspense. There are several rather disturbing scenes of a human being eaten alive by vicious bat-like creatures, and very computer-generated beings following them in the shadows, but it will scare only the weakest hearts. There is no more gore than the Mummy series.The story is magnificant, though not totally original. Several people taking a trip on a spaceship to some distant planet crash-land into a mysterious world where it only gets dark every once in a great while. It just happens to chance that they arrive just in time for the solar eclipse that provides the only darkness to the planet. Only then do they realize they are going to be eaten alive by an unknown yet terrifying (to them) breed of creatures that only comes out in the dark. This is where the movie gets good. Vin Deisel plays a very believable Richard B. Riddick, a convict being transported to another prison. Very similar to John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars. But the Similarities end there. Deisel, his eyes having been modified by an underground doctor in his previous prison, is the only one who is able to see the monsters. Everyone is forced to rely upon him to lead them to safety.The movie's script is a little wanting, but overall did a fair job of conveying the point. The humor is decent, with a few funny quips coming from a British passenger. This movie shows that sci-fi films can still be made without being overly geeky (Battlefield Earth, Wing Commander) and poorly acted. It shows that sci-fi films aren't all show and no story. It shows that films can give the effect of claustrophobia and intensity without being overly gory and grotesque. If you like a good, intense fantasy film that isn't super-geeky and super-techie, check out Pitch Black.

The harsh edges take the shine off the comedy at times and makes it slightly harder to enjoy but at it's core it's very good.  The core of the film is simply the marriage-like relationship between Felix and Oscar and the way that they are very different.This works mainly because Lemmon and Matthau are very good together.  Admittedly Matthau really pushes the Brooklyn accent to breaking point but Lemmon is spot on as the man who appears sympathetic at first but manages to push all our understanding onto his wife (who we never even see!).  The poker players are all good but really this is a two man show and the two men in question are bang on the money for the whole film.Overall I felt that the downbeat setup took a lot of sparkle out of the comedy and the film only got going once the `odd couple' relationship had been set up.  The film is very funny and should be enjoyed by anyone who has seen a bad buddy-buddy movie.  This is how it's meant to be.

One morning, he finds crop circles on his farm, leading to a series of events involving the possibility of alien life forms.

It is in a way, reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock, although I don't like comparing the master to any other filmmakers, no matter what I think of them.  The style of suspense building and character development shows the obvious influence Hitchcock had upon Shyamalan.Aside from the spectacular technical merits of the film, it is a well told story, with solid characters and an interesting plot.  The heavy handed way the questions of fate and faith are presented may turn some viewers off, but like them or not, they can't overshadow a fine piece of filmmaking.  The twist in the end, which isn't really a twist, but similar to one, is interesting but not impressive to the extent that the twist in The Sixth Sense.
