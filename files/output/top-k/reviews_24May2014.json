On my first full viewing, I was so tired that I fell asleep for part of it, thus making it harder for me to follow the story, so I paused it and came back to it later. I initially gave this film a 6\/10 but after having found the film easier to follow second time around due to being more awake, I upgraded my rating to a 7 because most of the film is engaging with a few minor flaws.First off, I found the acting from Rick Moranis overdone for his character Louis Tully. Secondly, the pacing was uneven with the part between the headline-hitting sequence and the climax with the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man being the slowest despite some effective scenes such as Louis and Dana becoming possessed (the view of Central Park as they embrace is beautiful as is the accompanying orchestral piece) and several ghosts taking over New York. Thirdly, the animation on the horned demons was jerky and a bit slow.Moving onto the positives, the theme song, despite being played three times throughout the film, is catchy and memorable while Elmer Bernstein's musical score is at its best when it is chilling and powerful. The animation on the ghosts, especially Slimer, was better than that on the horned demons and the Marshmallow Man was generally well done and the scanimation used for the proton streams to capture the ghosts was adequate. Moranis's overacting aside, the acting from the rest of the cast was subtly done, especially from Bill Murray and the late Harold Ramis. Annie Potts (who later went on to voice Bo Peep in the first two 'Toy Story' films) as the Ghostbusters receptionist Janine and Sigourney Weaver as Dana were surprising additions to the cast. A lot of the dialogue is memorable, especially the Don't cross the streams part and while the Ghostbusters base is run-down, the hotel dining room when the Ghostbusters catch Slimer is elaborate and the scenery of Central Park is stunning. I also liked the ghostly drone-sounding siren on the Ghostbusters' car, the haunting beginning at the library and the well-paced ending where Slimer surprisingly flies towards the screen.Overall, 'Ghostbusters' is a mostly entertaining horror film with its music, dialogue and the majority of special effects being its best features.

While I enjoyed this film for the most part as a child, I didn't like the ending because I was worried that John Smith was going to die and I remember telling my late grandmother how sad the ending was. Last Christmas I was trying to work out what the favourite Disney films of mine and my relatives were and while my top three are 'The Little Mermaid,' 'Oliver and Company' and 'Peter Pan' (this would probably be in my top ten), my mum's favourite is 'The Little Mermaid (in spite of me thinking her favourite was 'Beauty and the Beast')' and as per the summary of this review, my sister's favourite is this one despite me mistaking it was 'Cinderella.' This week, I re-visited this film twice; once with my mother when she recorded it from Channel 5 (although I only watched it from 'Colours of the Wind,' one of the best songs here, on that occasion) and today whilst renting the DVD. When finishing the viewing of this film, it was as good as I remembered albeit some forgettable scenes and songs due to not having seen this for a while.The best aspects of this film are its animation and music. The animation is up to Disney's usual standards with the character designs of the native Americans being completely different from those of the English settlers in this film and any other Disney Renaissance film character; picturesque backgrounds; and some beautiful, warm uses of colour, particularly the leaves that blow around Pocahontas and the sunrise\/sunset scenes. As for the music, most of the songs are more memorable than the incidental music. Not only did I like 'Colours of the Wind' but also 'Just Around the River Bend,' 'Mine, Mine, Mine,' 'Steady as the Beating Drum' and 'Savages,' which are also good. While the incidental music was initially forgettable, it had its moments of charm, beauty and tension and I liked the instrumental reprise of 'Colours of the Wind' towards the end. I have just learnt that the song 'If I Never Knew You' was not featured in the original theatrical release of this film but it is lovely nonetheless. The film ran at a fast pace throughout and while a lot of people say the story is historically inaccurate in parts, it is still engaging and carries some valuable messages about cultural diversity and choosing one's own path, although the scene where Pocahontas and John Smith introduced each other didn't go anywhere. I also liked the opening and closing shots looking like sepia tone sketches, which was a new and different way to depict them instead of using the traditional storybook method. Pocahontas and John Smith are both kind-hearted characters, Nakoma, Kocoum and Powhatan are supportive, Grandmother Willow is gentle and encouraging, John Ratcliffe is gluttonous and menacing while Percy, Meeko and Flit are all cute and comical. The voice acting is very good, although I wasn't sure if Mel Gibson as John Smith was meant to sound British or American but I liked Billy Connoly's voice for Ben, David Ogden Stiers as Ratcliffe and Irene Bedard, while not one of the world's best-known voice actresses, as Pocahontas as well as Judy Khun providing her singing voice.To conclude, this is one of Disney's most unique films with a heartfelt story, a good soundtrack on the whole and a valuable message. 9\/10.

We follow mindless office drone Peter (Ron Livingston), who gets by each day by doing the bare minimum at his tedious job while thinking up ways to patch things up with his estranged wife. When the couple's hypnotherapy session goes awry courtesy of the therapist dying of a heart attack, Peter is left in a state of eternal calm. Realising it's time to get one over on his insufferable boss, he recruits gangster rap loving white boy Michael (David Herman) and easily-angered foreigner Samir (Ajay Naidu) to teach the IniTech brass that greed isn't always good.The film hits the perfect note between comedic exaggeration and grounded reality, as things may start to feel a little too real for anyone stuck in the same dead-end job as Peter. Creeping around in the background of almost every scene are the tiny idiosyncrasies that make the typical workplace that little less bearable on an everyday basis. The rhythmic ringing of phones, monosyllabic conversations around the water cooler and endless amounts of menial tasks give Office Space a true sense of, well, space, and make our connections with its poor inhabitants all the easier.Most of the comedy may come from just how real everything feels, but don't underestimate the bit parts played along the way. Surrounding Peter's trio are a host of funny but fleshed-out side characters, including Peter's love interest Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), unfortunate office punching bag Milton (Stephen Root), world-weary and naturally cynical Tom (Richard Reihle) and passive-aggressive, scene-stealing boss Lumbergh (Gary Cole).

Though it is nearly a century old right now the sheer amount of creativity in this is simply mind blowing. Maybe looking at the long journey the cinema has come up to now from the time this movie was made comparatively the key point that comes to my mind is that 'not much improvement'. Because in a world where we believe that Saving Private Ryan is a masterpiece (It is no doubt) of war cinema All Quite on the Western Front (AQWF) has done it in a magnitude beyond its time and that's some mind boggling truth to realize. The background of the movie is based on a set of teenagers who joins the German army on the first year of World War 1. Thought they are still very young and attending to school the motivation they received through their school professor make them want to fight for their country. However they realize that the true face of war is brutal, unforgiving and severely stressful than the picture they received of it back at home. On blood, sweat and dead bodies they struggle to survive one day at a time seeing the devastation of war getting heftier by the night. While the story follows several individuals in a group the key character is Paul Bäumer who finally gets to return home after getting injured. But once he come back which is after 3 years from being in the front line he realizes that the place he call home is not what it used to be. And he becomes a stranger amongst the people of his home town. AQWF is based on a German novel (Im Westen nichts Neues) by Erich Maria Remarque, a German veteran of World War I. The movie is directed by Lewis Milestone. The storyline is very effective in terms of depicting the mentality of the soldiers who are fighting in the front lines and how the hardships of the circumstances break them. Lack of food, long hours on duty, fear of death, being homesick, losing their mates are all taking a toll on their motivation and ultimately the significance of their existence is lost. But the courage these young men show staring at death day in and day out is not to be underestimated. The other key point which made AQWF on top of my war movie list is the cinematography. Right from the start the details the movie concentrates upon is magnificent. In an age where CG was not heard of most of the scenes have being staged live and that must have being a tremendous effort from the whole crew. And there is one astonishing battle sequence that runs for a whole of 8 minutes nonstop and by the end of it the viewer will be sweating for sure. The true beauty of AQWF is how the director mixes up the selfless war and the humans full of emotions in to one. This mix ultimately proves that wars are fought by ordinary people in extraordinary situations and their lives are just as valuable no matter what side they fight for. But on the battle ground that is the only thing that seems to have no value and it's devastating. No war can be justified.

While driving drunk, John wrecks the car and kills his five year old son and blinds his teenage daughter Rebecca (Dollarhide). Susan isn't ready to forgive him yet but goes to Italy where John has just inherited a castle. The family struggles to adjust, but what they don't know is deep in the bowels of the castle is the title freak. A deformed man that was beaten, abused, and chained up since he was a small boy. Shortly after the family arrives the freak (Fuller) chews off his thumb to escape his chains and is loose in the castle observing the family. With her other senses heightened, Rebecca can feel his presence even though she can't see him. This makes for an eerie scene when the freak roams into her room to get a closer look. The family doesn't believe her claim after the police turn nothing up during a half-hearted exploration of the castle. John falls of the wagon one night and brings a prostitute (Raffaella Offidani) home and has sex with her as the freak watches. Once John leaves, the freak attacks her and kills her in gruesome fashion. The police suspect John when the prostitute doesn't show up anywhere and John is arrested. Two cops are sent to watch over Susan and Rebecca and they are quickly killed off as the girls try to fight off the freak during a rain storm in the finale. This is the third time stars Jeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton have teamed up with Director Stuart Gordon. Gordon manages to draw sympathy for the freak from the audience because the freak is like that due to years of cruelty. The castle provides some solid atmosphere as you might suspect and the lighting helps as well. The make up for the freak is ghastly and very effective and actor Jonathan Fuller does a good job in this difficult role. The freak is used much like the classic monsters of yesterday. He does graphic and terrible things but in ways it really isn't his fault. Like a lot of Stuart Gordon's movies, 'Castle Freak' doesn't skimp on graphic gore and blood and supplies it in good measure. Some of Gordon's normal dark humor is missing in this one, but it is stronger on atmosphere and mood. Set in Italy, this movie has a very Italian cinema feel to it, almost like a cross between Fulci and Argento. The thrilling ending in the rain storm is effective and suspenseful and the scenes where the freak is observing the blind Rebecca is the best of what this has to offer. Going down a slightly different path here, Gordon has a mild success with 'Castle Freak'.

Yes.Considering its minimal budget and lack of film-making expertise, it's pretty damn amazing. If you can forgive the lack of Hollywood glitz and grainy, student-like footage, it's a very compelling story which exhibits many traits which Christopher Nolan has used again (and expanded on) in his upcoming features.It's about a man who, needing inspiration for characters he's writing about, starts following random strangers around London in order to get some idea what 'normal' people do. However, what he doesn't bank on is when a suave thief who he follows catches him in the act and confronts him about it. Together they form an uneasy alliance and things take more than one turn for the worse. I'll keep the plot vague as it's one of those films that you can only really watch once and enjoy not knowing where it's going.

This is Dracula as high camp, with a highly theatrical performance from Gary Oldman (with tongue firmly in cheek) playing the Count as both an old-time romantic and modern-day ghoul. Let's be clear Oldman's performance is far from definitive (that honour goes to Christopher Lee), but it is memorable.Elsewhere, the film is hit and miss. For every hit there's a miss, for every great idea there's one that doesn't work. The art direction and set dressing is top notch, and I appreciate all the artiness of the direction; the stuff in the skies, the blood fountains like something out of Kubrick's THE SHINING, the overblown musical score. Elsewhere, the special effects have dated considerably, particularly Dracula's transformation into a cheesy giant bat. Plus the whole romantic sub-plot drags things down and goes nowhere.The cast is equally mixed. Anthony Hopkins really gets into the spirit of the thing, delivering a performance loaded with high camp as Van Helsing. Tom Waits's Renfield is arresting, Cary Elwes and Richard E. Grant are fine in minor parts, and somehow Sadie Frost works as the sexually frustrated Lucy. But two of the main parts are given to Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder, and it's clear from the outset that their hearts aren't really in it. They give dejected, dispirited and artificial performances, which isn't great.Still, with all the gory effects and imaginative interludes on offer, BRAM STOKER'S Dracula is a film that it's hard to dislike. Indeed, when I first saw it as a 14-year-old boy, I loved it to bits. Many years later, it feels deeply flawed, a movie that's all over the place.

There are no twists, no shocking reveals. It's just a straight up adventure.Secondly, it was more than nice to watch a movie with no CGI in it. We are talking good old fashioned practical effects, miniatures and painted backdrops for the most part. Simple stuff, but very effective.Thirdly, there was good old fashioned tongue-in-cheek humour and character interactions. Larger than life heroes and villains, and just a plain old amount of fun! Why aren't there modern movies made to this really simple formula? Everything now seems so serious and dreary in the scifi realm. Did we change so much that movies like Spacehunter no longer appeal to us?I was also pleased with the practical creature effects in Spacehunter. Men in fat suits made to look like some kind of human grubs. A snake-like dragon thing that was only on screen for a few seconds. It all speaks of the effort that went into making the film look good. Nobody here said Get the CGI guys to put something in. It was all done with silicon and puppetry and it still looked more effective than half the computer generated stuff you see nowadays.Spacehunter isn't well-written, the acting is cheesy at times, as is the dialogue, and the Mad Max-esque landscape is derivative, but damn it! It is fun to watch and enjoyable! That last comment is the highest praise I can heap on a film. That, despite its obvious limitations, it entertains you.

It took control of my mind and I could not empathize to characters' love, because every time then the things went a little bit wrong I expected Satine's tragic die. Nonetheless, the film was a truly original. It was fun to recognize really popular songs like Your song, Show must go on and others. Some people can be a little angry, because they so loved songs were adopted to cabaret style music, but this is the main reason why this movie shows so interesting and different from other movies. Also, the mix of show and real characters' life took a huge enough part of this movie's exclusivity. I some words, I give 10 to this movie, because of inspiring love story and originals decisions.

Then, after we are shown Lawrence crash, and his church memorial service, we are abruptly transported back in time.Now those of us with some familiarity with the story will of course know that this is WW1, in which Lawrence is serving as a young British Intelligence Officer, & where he started out as essentially a map clerk, somewhere in Arabia.Yet the uninitiated are basically just left to guess.And soon, and again abruptly, Lawrence is assigned to make contact with the nomadic Arab tribes, in order to facilitate revolt against the enemy German-allied Turks.Did Lean not believe that any back story was necessary to explain how Lawrence arrives at this point in his life? Such as-How he came to serve in the Military? -How he came to speak Arabic? -How he came to be selected for such an esoteric assignment?Moreover, as I watched the film, it was striking to me that there was not a single subtitle or voice-over to provide the date\/location\/details of any of the events.Contrast this with other historical films such as ' The Longest Day ', or ' Raging Bull ', or even ' Chaplin ', which provides such info, and also makes its significance clear.The absence of this info creates the effect of a circular panoramic mural Beautiful to look at, but challenging to follow, without a clear beginning, or clear direction, or clear ending.So IF this ' Panoramic ' effect was in fact Lean's intention, then he succeeded brilliantly, but I would have preferred more clarity.M ","genre":null},{"date":"24 May 2014","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Some time back I read ' The Uncrowned King of Arabia ', Michael Asher's BIO of T.

Really not in any way. The performances are at best OK for the most part, the story is silly, the sets are bare bones, the man-eating plant looks ... well ... not very scary at all. Just silly. But of course, you're making a mistake if you watch this expecting to find a masterpiece. It hasn't become known as a cult classic for no reason. It has pretty much everything you'd want to find in a cult classic. In its silliness, it's fun pretty much the whole way through. Interspersed among the OK performances is actually a pretty good one by Mel Welles as Gravis Mushnick, a flower shop owner whose store is on skid row, so he doesn't make much money. When his employee Seymour (Jonathon Haze) develops a new plant, it's a chance for Gravis to make money by getting people into the store to see the new plant and hoping to get them to buy flowers while they're there. Unfortunately, the new plant is a man-eater, and Seymour ends up having to find its food for it. There's a bit of a spoof of the TV show Dragnet going on, revolving around a couple of local cops assigned to find the people who've gone missing (after being fed to the plant.) There's even a very early role for Jack Nicholson as a guy who loves having pain inflicted on him by dentists!It's not a masterpiece. Not at all. Not in any way. But it has more than enough going for it to deserve the status of cult classic that it's gained. And you'll never hear the words Feed Me! again after watching this and not think about this movie!
