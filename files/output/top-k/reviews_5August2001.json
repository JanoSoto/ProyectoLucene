(Noteone or two spoilers ahead!)Firstly, the story is, well, stupid. The American army sends 8 men, under the command of Cpt. Miller (Tom Hanks), to go behind enemy lines is Normandy (just after D-day), to rescue Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), as his mother has already received telegrams informing her that her three eldest sons have been killed. A)It's simplistic; B)The army is not that compassionate. I'm sorry, it wouldn't happen, not then, not now.It's a shame, as the film has loads of qualities, like most Spielberg movies. There are the battle scenes, which are immensely realistic. The beginning 'beach scene' is like watching a documentary, it seems so real and true to reality. In fact, most of the battle scenes are great, they're all very exciting. This is due to the great camera work hand-held, and  to the effects the sets are fabulous, the music is absent during battles, for realism, and the scenes are bloody and realistically disturbing. Saving Private Ryan best invokes the chaos of war. Full Metal Jacket evoked war's stupidity, Paths of Glory was about the wastefulness of combat, and Deer Hunter (my favourite war movie) was about it's heartlessness. Bur 'Ryan' creates scenes of madness and chaos, in keeping with the madness of the mission. With the exception of Hanks and Damon, the acting is terrific. Adam Goldberg, Edward Burns, Giovanni Ribisi and Tom Sizemore are great, as is most of the cast.Yet these qualities are wasted by a lot of drawbacks. I can make my peace with the story, it can be called poetic license, although, the supposingly compassionate American army did send hundreds and thousands of G.I.s to their deaths by making the land on and storm the beaches of Omaha and Utah, which were surrounded by easily-defended but hard-to-attack cliffs, from which the Germans easily massacred the advancing American troops. If they had chosen a duned beach like the English and the Canadians did, the casualties would have half those suffered. But I digress. What I don't like is the reckless clicheing. There's Upham, a detestable character, seen in about every war or adventure film ever. He's wimpy, feeble, and never uses violence. Oh, and his complacent wetness results in the deaths of several of his squad-members. Yet he's a corporal. Let's face it, he wouldn't have gotten past training. Also, the Germans are pictured to be monsters. They are the enemy, only there to be killed or to kill, and they are always more treacherous than the good old trusty G.I.s, who all have hearts of gold, even the aggressive Rieben (Burns), who is another cliche character, by the way. I mean, just look at the German they release, who comes back and cold-bloodedly kills a couple of our goodies, and is made instantly hateable. While watching it, my mum cried 'Kill that b*st*rd German!' I rest my case. Finally, the ending is awfully twee. The death at the end reminds me of every sappy film on earth the tears, the whispering voice, the brave face, the honorable death. My God, it's like E.T.! I admit it, I laughed! Radio Flyer is less Sappy! As I said, I don't like Hanks or Damon. Damon is sort of smartass, big-headed yob, just like in Good Will Hunting (why did everyone like that movie?). And Hanks is just being Hanks. He's just reprising his Philadelphia persona, but at least it was original back in 1993. You know, he's all goody two-shoes, all honest and pure, and he's a tad over-weight, I hate to say it. He's almost as twee as in Castaway, which is a dreadful movie. I've only enjoyed watching Tom hanks in two movies Philadelphia and Forrest Gump. At least in those, his performances were original!It's a shame that Spielberg leaves realism behind halfway through 'Ryan', and turns to sentimentality and sappiness, because the beginning announces great stuff. A shame. 5\/10Uppers 1)Great camerawork; 2)Realistic battle scenes; 3)Great sound; 4)Dramatic portrayal of the chaos of war; 5)The supporting castDowners 1)Hanks and Damon are a four letter word rhyming with trap; 2)Riddled with cliches; 3)Upham's character what a stereotype; 4)What is this, The Dam Busters?

Quite tasteless; 5)The ending is downright trite!A quick note It's amazing how, in the U.K. and France at least, Spielberg avoids severe certificates. Jurassic Park easily warranted a 12, it is a PG-13 in the U.S. After all, a man's arm does get ripped off! In Schindler's List, we witness the horrendous mistreatment and murder of Jews, plus several scenes of nudity, yet it remains a 15. And in 'Ryan', people are disembowled and shot to bits in grisly detail, yet it is also only a 15. I agree that we need to be more liberal, but why does Spielberg alone get this special treatment.

There are so many points where you, the audience member will want to shake your head and say What? or possibly Why? and most definitely Huh???  The characters are annoying (the ones who live, which are easy to pick out...the names above the title and of course the kid.)  The rest are quickly dispatched Star Trek Style. The remaining ones, plunging through the dino-laden jungle like an especially loud herd of elephants, made me want to yell SHUT UP! if only they could have heard me.  Unfortunately, no helpful dinosaur showed up to eat them as I wished. Which is surprising considering the never-ending supply of dinosaurs on the island.Many things do not make sense in this film, from the relative durability of structures (the dinosaur retaining fences do not hold, but the Spinosaurus is put off by a half-demolished hut...) to the raptors so intelligent they can count their eggs, figure out some are missing and pinpoint the location of the thief, but never quite manage to outwit the supposedly smarter humans (except for the aforementioned appetizer people.)  And the ending was soooooo lame.  I don't need to reveal it but boy was it unbelievable.  Too easy, like they just gave up on the story and decided to end the movie.  I could never tell what the time of day was, it seemed to switch from morning to afternoon, to morning and then to night all in about 15 minutes of screen time. Many more items could be mentioned, but they can be summed up as lazy screenwriting.For the record, I liked Jurassic Park (the original) very much and this doesn't hold a candle to that flick.  I liked the dinosaur effects in all three movies, but although they should have been better in this film they weren't.  Maybe more dinosaur sequences would have improved the story.  My three year old son was unfazed by the dino fight scenes, they weren't that scary.  I was startled many times by the exceptionally loud noises, but not the menacing dinosaurs.  I wish it would have been a better story, but have pretty much come to expect this state of affairs in Hollywood today.  Too bad for us.

It did justice to the original, while changing enough of the story to make it unique on its own.  As for the ending, when I read through the other comments posted on this site, I realized that many people did not understand it or they have alternate explanations to what I believe.  Unfortunately, these other explanations do not make sense.  Therefore, I will explain the ending to clear it up.  First of all, and this is the most important fact, the planet that Mark Wahlberg crash lands on is not Earth.  The whole story and everything that happens on this planet is a separate issue from what has happened on Earth when he returns.  When he does return, he finds that Earth is now controlled by apes, obviously leading us to the question of how it happened.  Well, we are given the most important piece of information to understand this, the statue of General Thade.  We then know that he is the one who led the apes to the control of the planet.  The next question would be how he accomplished this task.  Well, he must first get to Earth in order to affect any change there.  And the only way to get to another planet is to fly there in a ship.  What ship?  The one that Mark Wahlberg crashed in and the one that General Thade knows all about.  How will he fly or learn to fly it?  The chimp pilot that is left on his planet.  So basically, here it is. General Thade is alive when we last see him.  He escapes or maybe just pretends to accept the changes that have occurred on his planet.  In order to flee the planet and perhaps to get some revenge against the human who changed his world, he salvages the ship from the water, somehow repairs it, assuming it needs to be repaired, since all we know for sure is that it had a rough landing, and then learns to fly it with the help, possibly by force of the chimp pilot.  He travels back along the same route as Mark Wahlberg and enters the storm.  He is transported back in time, but farther back then Mark Wahlberg.  Once there, he leads a rebellion of apes on Earth against humanity and wins.  That's it.  It is simple and makes perfect sense and contradicts nothing we saw in the movie.  And it is not even a new idea. If you have watched the old movies, and have seen Escape from the Planet of the Apes, you will remember that the apes got to Earth in almost the identical way.  They salvaged Charlton Heston's ship from the water, somehow repaired it and learned to fly it and returned back in time to Earth.  I actually think that is part of the reason this ending was used; as a throwback to one of the elements of the old movies.  Of course, this ending is a stretch to the imagination, but this is science fiction and the fact that it is possible is all that is required.  If you have watched the old Planet of the Apes movies, you will know that the stories stretched the line of believability even thinner.  This ending also adds the irony that is needed in these types of stories.  Mark Wahlberg changes the course of history on another world and then leaves to go back to his own, but is thwarted by General Thade, who basically does the same thing to his world. Now he is stuck on Earth in an even worse environment then the one he wanted so badly to leave.

It didn't quite live up to my expectations, but it certainly turned out to be a great suspense film. Robert Denairo stars as a professional thief who has been in the business for 25 years and is looking toward retirement to settle down in his hometown, Montreal, and maintain his restaurant. His partner in business, Marlon Brando, approaches him with an offer to steal a sceptor in the Montreal House of Commons worth more than Denairo has ever stolen put together. With the aid of the cocky and devious Edward Norton, Denairo reluctantly agrees to take the assignment. Basically the rest of the plot revolves around the characters and their quest to pull off the scepter heist. I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. There are not many elements to complain about other than I wish there were a few more scenes of suspense. There were a few parts in which I wished that there was less plot development and more suspense (unusual coming from me, seeing as how I feel movies today require much more plot development to be good). I also enjoyed the setting of Montreal, instead of the usual New York or LA setting (or even London or Paris for that matter). The ending was very enjoyable and did not drag on too long, but left me feeling satisfied. It did not try to play games for too long like the movie Entrapment (which wouldn't end!). The element of the movie I enjoyed most was that it did not turn the story into a shoot-em-up, 2 hour action scene with twenty heavily armed gaurds running down a hall getting picked off in bullet time by the main characters (which is a problem most movies recently have given in to). The movie was very entertaining and is one of those under-hyped summer movies I hope makes out well in the box-office.

A huge risk that Tim Burton took, and seemingly, with bad consequences.I was born 6 years after Charlton Heston went bananas on the original. I have *never* seen it. Once it was on TV, and I lost interest after five minutes. Not because it was a bad film, mind you, but because it looked too dated for me to watch, and I was in that terrible phase known as adolescence. It would have been uncool to watch a '68 movie. I will correct this mistake later, when I buy the original Apes.Anyway, I came into the movie theater with only one image of the original movie forever burned in my mind the epic Statue of Liberty climax. I purposely avoided all reviews of this film, so as not to spoil the fun. And I found myself deeply immersed in another Burton fantasy, where reality is as dark and grim as the lush landscapes that are always depicted in his worlds of madness. He is an expert in depicting outcasts (as in Batman, Sleepy Hollow and Edward Scissorhands), and although Mark Wahlberg wasn't as strong as Johnny Depp, Jack Skellington (or even Michael Keaton) as a main character, he was credible enough. Helena Bonham Carter is still incredibly seductive, even under tons of makeup and (gasp!) a beard. The rest of the characters are convincingly depicted, and the makeup excels.Again, not knowing the plot of the original, the only thing I disliked about this movie was that during the first half hour it dragged a bit. I guess that was due to the number of characters that were introduced. Afterwards, the movie turns quite philosophical (at least, IMHO). Was it directed at racism (which, from what I've seen, is still alive in the U.S.)? At animal cruelty? Was it a veiled message that we, as a thinking race, are doomed to remain evil and cruel with each other for all time? Or was Burton only trying to entertain us? (I doubt the last assumption). Whatever it is, this is one of those rare movies that open up a world of possibilities due to the use of metaphors. In a way, very similar to fairy tales, where the main character has to have enough resources to thrive and survive in a hostile environment...*SPOILER AHEAD* *SPOILER AHEAD* *SPOILER AHEAD* ...that is, unless you realize this is a mythic story and not a fairy tale, and that the ending has an amazing twist.

Scream doesn't take itself seriously and nor should we. The movie was made for horror fans and just simply a lot of fun. You may argue that the story is worthy of much ridicule but that was the basic point. We get a great openner, a solid mystery, and a great, blood soaked conclusion worthy of a slasher film. Solid from beginning to end. The best thing about the story is how they took the sex is bad vibe from horror movies and expanded it into something a bit more dramatic. Here we see the uneasiness of preparing to have sex for the first time, how special it can be when you find have it, and...how your sweet sensitive partner can turn cold after the deed is done. It's good that the movie had that much thought put into it.ACTING Neve Campell is good here and I really felt sorry for her character because of all that she went through. David Arrquette is alright as the clueless cop. Courtney Cox plays a bitchy tabloid reporter very well. Matthew Lillard was damn funny and Skeet Ulrich gives what's probably the best performance out of the whole film. His character ranges from easy going to intense and he pulls it off very well. I guess looking like Johnny Depp REALLY helps. Also of note are Rose McGowan as the blond best friend, Jamie Kennedy as the horror film expert, and Henry Winkler (aka Fonzie) in a rather ironic cameo. Oh yeah...Drew Barrymore is here too.DIRECTING Good suspense. Good camera angles. No cheesy shots.

This movie also has a killer soundtrack with my favs being the ones by Birdbrain, Soho, and Nick Cave. Red Right Hand was so good that it carried on to the sequels.

'hey this could actually be okay'.  I was expecting it to go downhill form there, but strangely it didn't. It held my attention with decent characters, a good (and for once original) plot and some great and very memorable scenes (big swinging axes ahoy!!). And it seems that everyone else in the almost full cinema agreed with me. Even the third time I went to see it (a good 5-6 weeks after it was released over here (in England)) the cinema was still almost full. And when the film had finished I heard many people (young and old) commenting on how much they enjoyed it... Indeed I haven't actually MET a person I know who has seen it who DOESN'T like it. (then again I've only talked to about 6)I've read many reviews of D&D that describe Jeremy Irons' acting as 'hammy' and, ok, I have to admit I almost cringed after his first couple of lines. But he plays Profion (the bad guy) brilliantly, and you soon get to realise what the character was intended to be like.... i.e. a complete mad man, a loon! It just goes to show that we Brits really can produce high grade bad guys! I also must complement Bruce Payne for playing Damodar so well, I don't know about anyone else but I really grew to hate him (not the actor obviously, the character he played) as the film progressed , he really does have a chilling, villainous voice on him. In fact the entire cast played their roles well. I've heard some people giving a bit of stick to Thora Birch who plays Empress Savina. However I think she's plays the character pretty well, certainly better than Princess Amidala in Episode 1 and by the end of the film she gets some real backbone to set things straight.The effects are consistently strong, from the breathtaking opening flyby over the city of Sumdall, to the amazing dragon battle. And the dragons really do look great. I've heard some say that the climactic battle is too short (it's not!!), but even if it was, who cares when it's this good! Also if you want some seriously cool effects check out the sword fight nearer the end. Throughout the film there is enough action to make sure things don't get boring. D&D has it's own unique 'feel' to it that sets it aside from other fantasy films such as Dragonheart, and while it is certainly not a childish film it never takes itself TOO seriously, basically it's spot on in my view.D&D's soundtrack also deserves a special mention. For me it shined through during the entire film. There are a number of themes which crop up, whenever Ridley (the hero) does anything heroic or whenever a fight breaks out the music really succeeds in picking up the pace. Also the villains (Profion and Damodar) have their own menacing, sometimes even frightening themes (anyone who owns the soundtrack, see Damodars Curse).As far as I can see all the criticisms aimed at D&D are unjust, it isn't TRYING to be a masterpiece, it's simply a very good and very entertaining film.....if I haven't got it across particularly well so far, I think it's excellent! There really is no reason not to like D&D. It has something there for everyone. If you have any doubt go and see it. you might be pleasantly surprised!

(No, Boogie Nights wasn't THAT big.)First of all, the monkey suits were killer!
