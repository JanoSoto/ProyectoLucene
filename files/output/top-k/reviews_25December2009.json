But the latest viewing,it seems I finally got it. Mission Impossible is a film that you have to pay strict attention too,otherwise you will eventually get lost,as it's a very confusing film. It isn't action packed like the sequels are,it's more of a mystery type thriller,but it has plenty of suspense,plenty of surprises,with an explosive finale that will have you on the edge of your seat!. I especially liked the train sequence at the end,it was very well done. I thought the casting of Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt was a bit strange at 1st. Now I am a huge Cruise fan,but he just didn't seem like the Action hero type. He proved me wrong big time,and did what he did best,put on a captivating show,his charisma is a big reason this film worked. The big twist at the end is shocking to say the least. Some would say it didn't make much sense,I personally thought it was a nice touch,because the film needed to end with a big bang,and I thought it did just that!.Mission Impossible isn't as flashy or action packed as the sequels,but as far as i'm concerned it may very well be the best in the series.Performances. Tom Cruise has proved to be one of Hollywood's most charismatic and reliable actors for what seems like forever. Here he does not disappoint. He makes a great Ethah Hunt,he's witty,he oozes charisma,adding the perfect balance of charm&likability to Ethan. He handles himself well in the action scenes too,as I said he was a big reason in making this film work,with his undeniable charisma. Jon Voight is a hell of a presence. He always adds class and excellent acting to any film he's in,here was no different. Emmanuelle Béart is certainly a beauty,but she can also act pretty good too. She was highly mysterious,it kept her character unpredictable. Henry Czerny is full of intensity. His banter with Cruise in the restaurant was chilling stuff,I loved the guy!. Jean Reno is OK here. He is a capable actor,but I didn't much care for him in this. Ving Rhames is a pure bad ass,and while his role isn't as big as in the next two,he still came through. Rest of the cast do fine.Bottom Line. Mission Impossible is an excellent spy thriller. It's exciting,suspenseful and downright unpredictable. Highly recommend,if you choose to accept this Mission.8 1\/2 \/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"25 December 2009","score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Mission Impossible was a film that I initially didn't care for,during my 1st few viewings.

From start to finish, this establishes and maintains an atmosphere and crafts a tension so thick, you *can't* cut it with a knife, you'd need a razor-blade. The editing and cinematography, with only a handful of exceptions, are inspired, using light and darkness immensely well, and utterly terrifying the audience. This is marvelously well-shot. The plot is excellent, and the twist is unexpected and has a relatively subtle, yet nicely effective reveal. Granted, when you think it all through, you do have to accept one or two details that strain credulity. Still, this is exciting and creepy whenever it attempts to be, and the relatable story and credible, well-developed, human characters are the driving force of the movie. Inbetween the sequences of suspense - to keep it from overstimulating the audience - there is humor, and every joke and gag are funny, none fall flat or try too hard. The acting is impeccable, every performance is spot-on. While there are jump-scares, most of the build-up pays off, big time. The music is excellent, and contains a good bit of rock, as well as a cue that they must have composed with Psycho in mind. There is a lot of disturbing content, some sexuality(including in dialog), brief nudity and a little bloody violence in this. The DVD comes with a well-done half-hour long behind-the-scenes featurette that covers the majority of the areas of production, and the theatrical trailer. I recommend this to every fan of horror. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"25 December 2009","score":"9 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" I haven't watched any other film by Bornedal(including the American remake, which I understand is inferior to this), but he certainly nailed this one.

While eating out in a restaurant Laura meets two elderly sisters named Wendy (Clelia Matania) & Heather (Hilary Mason) who claims to be psychic & is able to talk with & see Laura's dead daughter Christine, Laura begins to believe the sisters & feels better knowing that Christine is able to communicate with her but when John finds out he is sceptical & wants nothing to do with the sisters...This English Italian co-production was directed by Nicolas Roeg & the script was based on the short ghost story Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier & the script takes that basic idea & stretches it out over 110 minutes with variable results. Don't Look Now is often held up as some artistic masterpiece packed with depth, meaning & symbolism as well as a twist ending that in my opinion is alright but hardly the genuine surprise shocker than many might have you believe while other's describe Don't Look Now as a boring mess that people read far too much into & interpret even the littlest thing as having some great meaning. To me the truth lies somewhere between the opinions as I appreciate Don't Look Now as a decent & often absorbing ghost story it didn't knock my socks off & it did bore me a bit which is the ultimate sin a film can commit as far as I am concerned. The majority of the film fells like a calm drama where everything is normal & two grieving people are just trying to get on with their lives, there's the sub-plot about the psychic sister but largely it's pretty unremarkable stuff until the hour mark where the supernatural elements kick in more & all the set-ups that Roeg has staged & planted start to come to fruition but it's still sedately paced by anyone's standards & then there's that twist ending which is sort of gruesome in a dark way which then does try to tie everything together in a series of flashbacks that sort of work but isn't entirely satisfying. Don't Look Now goes from tedium to mystery to gripping drama to horror & almost everything between without ever really grabbing me, sure I liked it & it tells a decent ghost story with a decent twist ending but I wanted to describe it as brilliant & not just decent.Roeg really lets fly with the imagery here as it's absolutely everywhere, from the broken glass of the mirror at the start to the broken glass of the glasses on the table Laura knocks over to the broken glass at the end to the symbolism of the water Christine drowned in as they move to Venice which is obviously a city built around water, the water in glasses Laura breaks, the rain whenever we go back to England & the like & then there's the shiny red plastic mac which also becomes a major part of the films imagery. Don't Look now is the sort of film some could sit down & analyze for like hours, every scene or every moment could have an alternate meaning or some sort of hidden depth, personally I think life is too short for that & while there is obvious symbolism here it gets dull fairly quickly. There's no real gore in it although the twist ending does feature a little blood & there's a pretty steamy sex scene here too. Don't Look now is undeniably well shot with nice cinematography & the tight, narrow streets & canals of Venice almost become a character in their own right.With a supposed budget of about $1,500,000 this has good production values & is well made, shot on location in both England & Italy. The acting is alright, Sutherland is OK but not brilliant while Julie Christie at least looks great.Don't Look Now is a film that is a personal experience, how much you get out of it will depend entirely on how you take to Roeg's symbolism & the often sedately paced nature of the story which just has either Suntherland or Christie run around Venice for extended periods not doing that much.

The guests are NOT hallucinations or ghosts, or anything abstract. They are matter, and they're really there - just like you and I. Sure they are explained to be made of neutrinos and not true flesh and bone, but it's really all the same at it's core. Wouldn't Kris agree? To me the most substantial conclusion to be drawn from this film is it's existential dealings, specifically with our human perception of life.

Good science fiction is still largely confined to the library in my opinion, but there are some good films. Solyaris is among the best.I've only seen it once. Last night it was on Netflix and it looked good so I watched it. I'm VERY glad I was able to stumble upon this movie. For me science fiction is mostly about the concept. I want my mind to be challenged. The story is very important definitely, but I appreciate an imaginative, creative, and intelligent concept above all else, and this movie delivers.I think a lot of people miss an important detail about this movie, one which is central to my interpretation of it. The guests are NOT hallucinations or ghosts, or anything abstract. They are matter, and they're really there - just like you and I. Sure they are explained to be made of neutrinos and not true flesh and bone, but it's really all the same at it's core. Wouldn't Kris agree? To me the most substantial conclusion to be drawn from this film is it's existential dealings, specifically with our human perception of life. We are organized matter convulsing and reacting to chemicals. That is the scientific view. There is nothing abstract in the makeup of who we are. So really are we only imitating life? What was Hari's reproduction? Organized matter imitating life. Not as aptly as a human, because it wasn't human - but was that the only true difference between her and the real Hari? Kris felt love for the reproduction very strongly. But wouldn't that be a natural thing to occur since after all, love is only a chemical - matter reacting to matter? At the end we see Kris back on Earth, returning to his home. However he is actually on a large scale reproduction which is one of the islands formed by the Ocean. But how could Kris ever know the difference? Your loved ones, your home, your emotions, your memories and this world are made up of matter that can be reproduced. Physical material... does it end there?

This looks gorgeous all the way, and the effects are astonishing. The design of beings, locations and items is all creative and well-done. Cinematography and editing are excellent. This is very exciting, and the action is cool and has the impact it is meant to. The score helps the epic scope, and the foreign, non-human language-use makes the world we are seeing feel more strange and distant.

The question is Pulp Fiction a timeless masterpiece that should be put up upon a pedestal? My answer no. It's a good movie, to be sure, and the main characters are, to an extent, well-developed, but Tarantino stuffs his film so full of peculiar hipsterism and allusions to obscure TV shows and movies that it nearly drowns out the plot. It also splits viewers to those in the know about whatever film or hipster references Tarantino is making, and those who haven't a clue, and either feel the film is eccentric or are chagrined to not be smart enough to get it. This movie has forced elitism in cinema to the mainstream, where arcane references and bold gimmicks (such as a distorted time-line) have been lauded as visionary. Previous mainstream great films were straightforward in their presentation of the story, but had such great plot and acting that they stood on their own without relying on gimmicks. Tarantino takes a decent plot and stuffs it with extraneous stuff and the critics buy into it. This truly is a film that cannot stand on the merits of its actors or plot alone.One thing that will take a viewer off-guard---and which fans tout as an example of Tarantino's genius---are the long periods of weird and pointless dialogue punctuated with fast, flashy violence. Long dialogue seems like a trademark of Tarantino movies, and whether you like or hate his movies depends on how strong your attention span is. In this ADD world of ours, I'd think long, droning dialogue is a major no-no, but somehow Tarantino loves to include it as essential to his films. In some movies, like the Death Proof half of Grindhouse, is can be a Bataan Death March form of torture to have to endure. In Pulp Fiction, it can get boring, but is not too terrible. The scenes where Travolta and Jackson drone on about burgers in France, and where Thurman and Travolta discuss Thurman's audition for a TV show, it is irrelevant and boring, though I'm sure Tarantino fans will tell the unwashed among us that we just don't get it. When Ving Rhames and Harvey Keitel speak, their words relevant, witty and interesting. Jackson's peculiar monologue before killing an enemy, which is a mishmash of Bible verses strung together in a rather incoherent, rambling manner, is fun to listen to, as Jackson says it with rage and passion, but ultimately is meaningless prattle that does little to further the plot until the last chapter of the movie. In all, Pulp Fiction is full of too much talk that accomplishes nothing to further the plot or convey anything revealing or meaningful about the characters.The disposal of a linear plot line is sometimes relevant to a movie, particularly if it is used to emphasize something about a character or a particular scene. In Pulp Fiction, the nonlinear plot is a device for emphasizing certain characters, whether Travolta's, Jackson's, or Willis's. In essence, Pulp Fiction is merely four mini-movies connected only by the thread of common characters (all of whom seem to be working for the crime lord played by Ving Rhames). Tarantino is to be commended, in this instance, for not following through with a straightforward plot and instead treating his film more as a character study. If you try to view this film as anything more than four separate character studies, you get a damned mess. The way this film was sold to the public, the nonlinear device's true purpose was not made clear, and first-time viewers will not understand Tarantino's vision on a first-time viewing. In spite of the apparent uniqueness of the nonlinear device, I wonder just how original it is.The violence is gratuitous to an extent, but at least Tarantino explores its morality. The characters of Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson are the most important with regards to the exploration of the morality of a life of crime. They are truly three-dimensional characters who reevaluate their lives. The other characters seem one-dimensional and are less interesting by comparison. Other than the analysis of morality from the two characters mentioned, Tarantino uses violence as a means to shock the viewer. The gimp scene in the store basement and Uma Thurman's OD scene are simply shocking, with little to recommend to them other than they are violence for the sake of violence. I am not particularly intelligent enough to get cinema as an art-form, but it seems like violence as an art-form is becoming accepted in serious films, much to the detriment of anything substantive. It is a disturbing trend that Tarantino tries to justify as art. I wish serious movies would rely less on violence-for-violence's sake. It is not intellectually appealing, and is instead disturbing.Other than being an interesting series of character studies, Pulp Fiction has little else going for it. This movies shows promise for Tarantino as a crafter of interesting stories, but at the same time it is too preoccupied with trying to be hip. It has spawned a series of inferior imitators that have lowered the quality of cinema as a whole. For this reason, Pulp Fiction has done more harm than good for American movie-making in general.

It must be a real challenge for writers and directors to weave such unpleasant topics into blackly comical script, but Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet, in their long feature debut, pull it off seemingly without much effort. In a post-nuclear apocalyptic world, where natural food sources have become real scarce, former traveling one-man circus artist Louison applies for a job as a handyman in an apartment building owned by the sneering butcher Clapet. What Louison obviously doesn't know is that Clapet is a psychopathic cannibal who cuts up all his handymen after a while and feeds them to the rest of deranged tenants. Louison's only hope for rescue is his blossoming romance with Clapet's shy and nerdy daughter Julie or perhaps the Troglodytes; an underground vegetarian movement. Delicatessen is a pretty brilliant piece of surrealist and progressive film-making, but only if you allow the film's bizarre comic book ambiance and morbid fairy-tale like designs to absorb you entirely. First and foremost, I love how this is another post-apocalyptic Sci-Fi film that appears to take place in a 1930's setting! I can't properly explain why, but to me this is the ultimate in disturbing. We're supposedly in the future but people wear hideous ancient clothes and decorate their apartments with furniture that even your great-grandmother would find old-fashioned. This old and grim depiction of a futuristic society is something we don't see enough but always has a tremendous impact, like in Letters from a dead Man or Terry Gilliam's Brazil. Besides, Caro and Jeunet obviously found a lot of inspiration in Gilliam's oeuvre. Furthermore owes the film a lot of its powerfully comical impact to the magnificent script that pays attention to every smallest detail. Each and every single tenant in Clapet's apartment building is a deliriously decadent individual, like the woman who hears voices in her head and continuously undertakes fruitless suicide attempts, or the elderly and extremely peculiar gramps (glorious role for the aging horror\/exploitation veteran Howard Vernon) who deliberately floods his apartment to keep his collection of frogs alive. Delicatessen is at times gruesome and grim and at other times hilarious and light-headed, but it constantly remains ingenious and uniquely original from start to finish. Great acting performances from the ensemble cast, visually striking effects and nightmarish set-pieces. Heck, even the romance story is genuinely heart-warming and enchanting.

The project began life as a Kubrick feature, but was handed over to Spielberg who then fittingly rounded the piece off following Kubrick's death. I think the film would've sat quite nicely with the already vast collection of widely recognised great films the man made. As it happens, Artificial Intelligence AI is a film that manages to combine ideas, themes and writing that produces genuine emotion with the latest and greatest in special effects to deliver something close to remarkable. The film is a wild; all encompassing; unpredictable and adventure fuelled tale of a young cyborg boy on a Pinocchio infused journey to uncover who, or what, the Blue Fairy is, and where they're based so that the boy may become 'real'. To merely say that it is quite the visual and emotional experience, would be understating it somewhat.Haley Joel Osment plays the young, robotic boy of the title; a certain David who's initially adopted by the Swinton family in the 22nd Century, the husband and father of which is named Henry; and is an employee at the company that has made David. David's purpose is to come across as son-like and as real as possible, thus injecting love and well-being into the household he's assigned to. Any complaints or criticisms in the past about whoever in regards to child actors coming across as wooden, or robotic, in their skills sort of take a jab back here, as the child-actor lead is indeed, a robot in what is a performance by Osment which works.David is a son that doesn't need feeding, educating, sleep nor too much attention in regards to constantly keeping it entertained. It creeps about, it follows its newly acquired family and it does and says simplistic things. After a while, David's presence sparks off a troublesome relationship with the Swinton's real son, a certain Martin whose problems with disease have rendered him half machine anyway by way of his artificial legs. Martin and David's antagonism is born out of Martin's sadistic and naive response to the new family member, further instilling a somewhat unfortunate sense of humans being ill suited to the technology on display. These sequences also get across a sense of who are the real individuals you ought to be afraid of; a sense that Martin is nastier and more frightening than David is, despite David's collection of initial eerie, ominous scenes and actions. What these early house-set sequences tap into, is the human race's supposed difficulty in dealing with technology and modernity they themselves have created and allowed to spill out into the hands of others whom are either unsure of it, or might misuse it. It's here a somewhat sly allegory to the sorts of weapons certain nations have access to, or are supposedly in the process of creating, might be read into.As the film appears to be bedding down into a household set; domestically driven; family orientated drama about human beings, and their (in)ability to co-exist with machines in an ever changing world, it jumps ship and broadens out to become something else entirely. The film adopts a relatively routine, familiar even, arc of the singular strand variety; that is to say it is a raw character study of how one individual will cover a number of different locales, forever discovering himself and things about other people as they get ever closer to their goal. David's journey takes him from a down-to-Earth home in the 22nd Century; to the 22nd Century equivalent of a red light district; to some sort of derby gathering during which old and worn out robots are blown apart for sake of entertainment (which sounds like the premise for some more recent, inferior science fiction films); right the way through to ocean covered, post-apocalyptic cities and the items buried deep within the fathoms.David's journey sees him accompanied, on and off, by two other machines; both of whom are designed to serve human beings in some form, and one of whom struggles in this role in what is a further example of the clashes between man and machine when they have an altercation with a human that'll see them go on the run from the law. This character is Gigolo Joe, a sweet talking; built in jukebox sporting; male prostitute droid played by Jude Law, while the far smaller Teddy (Angel), a mere child's toy, talks in a monotone manner expressing the best possible course of action as David flits from one set up to another. Teddy's low-key and gruff, electronic voice complete with constant referencing to the lead by his very name, 'David', echoes HAL's referencing of another respective lead, by way of 'Dave', from a past Kubrick feature.Like that respective film; Artificial Intelligence AI begins at one point, a relatively low key and familiar enough domestic locale, before branching way off the beaten path and into the uncharted realms of the fantastical. It isn't quite the experience of 2001 A Space Odyssey, beginning at the dawn of mankind and going right the way through to everything that came with that respective film's finale, but it's of that scope and of that aspiration. There's a lot of ground for the characters to cover in Artificial Intelligence AI, both physically and emotionally, and the film never allows the spectacle of its locations and special effects to overwhelm nor consume the heart-felt, often harrowing quest the lead is going on. This achievement, on top of what is a riveting and heart-felt adventure, is enough to recommend the film to a pretty high degree.

They all play essential roles in the film, and I can't imagine Top Hat with any one of them missing, yet none of them manages to get in the way. Also, the music of Irving Berlin adorns the film, and there is not one song that is less than 5\/5 stars. Astaire & Rogers' movies tended to have fairly simple comedic plots, but this one is funnier than usual, with a series of misunderstandings that would have probably made this a good screwball comedy even without the musical numbers. The basic misunderstanding has to do with Ginger Rogers' character believing that Fred Astaire's character is actually the husband of one of her closest friends. Ginger is not only offended by the fact that she is being openly pursued by someone that she thinks is a married man, but she is confounded by her friend's seemingly casual attitude towards the entire situation. Last but not least, there is the enduring chemistry of Astaire and Rogers themselves and the beauty of their dance numbers. Ginger Rogers was a very good actress in her own right, and she knew that just because the music started the acting did not stop. She wasn't a great dancer, but she was good enough and got better as time went on. As for Astaire, he was probably the best individual dancer we'll ever see, plus he exuded pure class.

But it probes and reaches much deeper into life in its many characters. It contrasts greed with unselfishness, ambition and dreams with sacrifice and kindness, disrespect with trust, arrogance with humility, lies with truth, power and loneliness with compassion and friendship, exploitation with integrity.

Maybe it has to do with maturing or that mysterious acquisition of wisdom that comes with years. Maybe it has to do with slowing down in retirement, paying more attention to details and people and surroundings. Maybe it's a combination of these and other things. But after going a few years without seeing It's a Wonderful Life, I played the DVD at home just before Christmas this year and saw much more than I had remembered of the film in the past. To be sure, there is nothing wrong with the warm sentimentalism I had associated with the movie over the years. But this time I saw and heard and became immersed in a film steeped in values and development far beyond plain entertainment or of a happy story with a happy ending. Good movies of various genres must be entertaining to be enjoyable. Comedies, romances, musicals, and others may provide good talented performances, humor, action, excitement or mystery. And some may have one or two social values or morals interwoven in their plots. But good drama demands exposition and exploration of more values and a wider range of emotions and mores. That is what we see and hear and become part of in It's a Wonderful Life.This film has the standard good guys versus bad guys, and the good-over- evil happy ending. But it probes and reaches much deeper into life in its many characters. It contrasts greed with unselfishness, ambition and dreams with sacrifice and kindness, disrespect with trust, arrogance with humility, lies with truth, power and loneliness with compassion and friendship, exploitation with integrity. It's about taking and giving, honesty and dishonesty, hating and loving, family and friends. And as these themes weave throughout the texture of the story, we see the emotions of love, anger, happiness, shame, fear, hurt and joy play out. In his state of despair, George Bailey gets a chance to see his world without his having been born. We viewers share in seeing the sharp contrasts in the people, places and events that we had seen in George's life up to that time. The enduring message is the huge importance of a single life in the lives of all others. And how one person &#x96; each one of us &#x96; is so important in shaping the lives of others and the events of life far beyond our own small worlds. We have much to celebrate when we realize how wonderful life really is. ","genre":"Drama, Family, Fantasy"},{"date":"25 December 2009","score":"","review":" This movie is fantastic. Although the supporting cast is great, every single other actor is completely out shined by Murrays brilliance.

This movie made me think about all of the roles Murray either should have been cast as, or roles he should have taken. I couldn't help but think that he may have made a better American Psycho than Christian Bale, and I'm a huge Bale\/Bateman fan.

They generally take up some moralistic stance and you have a clear good vs bad story line as if it is some sort of Batman movie.But with Lumumba it is the first movie I've seen that showed politics for what it is, and the real issues of trying to rule a country of broken people who have known no other rule but violence. There were no good or bad there were just interests and conflicts of interest. This is the only political movie in my opinion that one can come out of it truly learning something. Especially for anyone with their eye on politics as a career this movie shows you, you cannot rule on what you want for a country, but what the country wants from you.That's why I disagree with a lot of reviews that say everyone comes of bad, I think they come of too idealistic, (the Belgians want the perfect colony, Lumumba wants a perfect Unity Congo, Tshombe wants wealth and riches, America wants the perfect ally against communism, Russia wants the perfect aide for Communism). And the Congolese? They come off used and abused, ( best example in the movie when Général Janssens tells his black troops your government lied to you and it leaves them all in an uproar) they are always being pulled and pushed into supporting this person or another.This movie shows in politics a mistake can cost you dearly and this movie everyone makes mistake after mistake until it escalates and ends up destroying the country. Their intentions might be good (or at least in the characters opinion), but it's everyone's mistakes that lead to the downfall of Congo. I don't think anyone is bad in this film, I just think they want too much from people sick of giving and want to start taking.Overall, it's not just the best political film, it is a great film in general. Acting is fabulous (Eriq Ebouaney as Lumumba was perfect casting I really believe him) script flawless, editing perfect pace, and production value higher than I expected for a central African film.

Devoid of the leathery skin so characteristic of the true gangsters, whose excessive use of alcohol no doubt contributes to the premature dehydration of their skin, and whose deeds weigh heavily enough on their conscience to cause deeply furrowed brows, Depp looks as though he has spent his life at a health spa drinking mineral water! Really, too much! When I watched the documentary included on the DVD, I found that, sure enough, the true Joe Pistone actually looks as though he could possibly be a gangster. That was how he succeeded in feigning fraternity with Lefty for six years. Johnnie Depp? Don't think so. Totally implausible. Invraisemblable. A major casting flaw in an otherwise excellent film.The story is a genuine tragedy, no doubt. And Al Pacino did a wonderful job as always--though I did note that in a couple of scenes he was empirically distinguishable from Rickie Roma in GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS. I guess that's okay, though, since Roma was corrupt in his own sort of way. In other scenes, I saw the protag from SCENT OF A WOMAN. I guess that makes sense, too, however, since Lefty was aging and full of regrets as well.Definitely worth seeing and very thought-provoking, but it takes a real effort to suspend disbelief when it comes to Depp's role.

The Searchers will offend most Native Americans because of the simplistic, negative caricatures of the Comanches. The film's racism was downright embarrassing to me as a European American, as when an American military man shows Ethan three white women taken back from Comanche captivity - one a middle-aged woman screaming hysterically and two younger women smiling in a deranged manner unable to speak. The military man says, It's hard to believe they're white. Ethan retorts, They're not anymore; they're Comanche. The wrong-headed notion that transference from a European American lifestyle to a Native American lifestyle would crack the psyche and that some sort of ensuing derangement would be characteristically Comanche is bigoted and racist, as well as being untrue. There are many documented cases of European Americans actually preferring to live among the Native Americans going all the way back to the days of Christopher Columbus's campaign of exploitation. Check out the book Lies My Teacher Told Me for some instances of these.Regarding the recurring conflicts between European Americans and Native Americans, The Searchers also conveniently ignores the fact that those of European descent systematically cheated and robbed the natives of their land with sanction and encouragement from the U.S. government. One need only research the number of treaties the U.S. government authored and then violated to confirm this. Also, check out the repeated attempts at ethnic cleansing - for example Andrew Jackson's shameful and immoral persecution of the Cherokees.
