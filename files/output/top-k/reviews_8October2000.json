Because there really isn't anything I can say about this film to articulate what it means. I can try (and I will), but you simply have to see it for yourself. I mean that. I went to see this movie because I'm a sucker for Oscar buzz. And this movie has it. But forget all that. If you can't now, you will... I did. First of all, this movie had quite an effect on me. I would say the movie makes you want to go out and change the world, but I hope it doesn't... it should make you go out and actually change the world. Make some kind of a difference. Because that's what the young boy in the film did. And the world was better for it. On one level, the film is about three people... an altruistic 11-year-old kid, his alcoholic mother, and his physically scarred elementary school teacher. The teacher gives an assignment Think of an idea to change the world, and put it into ACTION. The kid comes up with Pay it Forward Do a big favor for someone else ... something they cant do for themselves, and instead of having them do something in return for you, they pay it forward... three big favors, for three other people. And that's just the setup... this film was incredible! Fantastic acting, an inspiring story, emotional, tragic, a total powerhouse movie. So I've told you... but what does it really mean... well you won't know until you see it. This movie pulls at you. You go through the same frustration as the boy when he wonders if the world can be changed. Or if it will just remain s**t and it would be hopeless for any of us, in all our vanity to attempt such a feat. Maybe it can't be done alone. Maybe it can start out small, and grow. Maybe this movie (as lame as this sounds) can be the beginning. ","genre":null},{"date":"8 October 2000","score":"","review":"  Wow. I don't think I need to say any more.

A lot of the fans were trashing the movie before filming even started and a lot of others had such high expectations that they were going to be disappointed even if it turned out to be the greatest movie ever made. I admit that Endgame isn't perfect, but I don't think that it's anywhere near as bad as a lot of people are saying. The movie is actually quite enjoyable if you're a fan of the tv series. The acting is pretty good. Adrian Paul and Christopher Lambert work very well together. Bruce Payne makes an interesting bad guy. Also, there's a lot of cool action. The choreography of the fight scenes is great. However, I'd definitely recommend staying away from this movie if you're not familiar with the tv series or if you just didn't like it. The story moves very fast and there's a lot of things that you won't understand if you haven't watched the series. And the movie pretty much feels like another episode of the tv show, so if you have watched the series and didn't like it, then Endgame isn't for you either. I gave Endgame a 10\/10 just because I think it is worth more than the average rating it has gotten.  I'd really say that it deserves a 7\/10 because the acting was good and the story definitely has potential. With a few added scenes, I believe that the movie would have been great.

We fear those who are different than us. We tend to reject what we don't understand.The film is about the redistricting and forced integration of two high schools in Virginia in 1971. An all-white football team that has had great success its past few seasons must now give up parts of its roster to players from the school it's merging with-who just happen to be all black. The white players have played under coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton), who is a nominee for the Virginia High School Football Hall of Fame. The school's athletic board, believing they can prove that integration is a bad idea, brings in Herman Boone (Denzel Washington), a black man, to replace him as head coach. They'll then sit and wait through training camp until Boone's team loses a game, then fire him. Yoast unexpectedly stays on as Boone's defensive coordinator, however, and they head for camp. Understandably, the white players have difficulty with the situation. They feel, justifiably, that their team was just fine the way it was. They know each other. They were winning.Another great point that Titans makes is that sometimes winning is not important. Coach Boone wants to win but, like all great coaches, he won't deny any kid who wants it the chance to compete and contribute. He designs the two-week training camp to force the boys to get to know each other. Like it or not, this is our team, is what he's saying to them. `I don't care if you like each other,' he tells them, `but you will respect each other.' At first, it looks like they'll do neither. Boone forces them to room with someone they don't know, which usually ends up being someone of a different race.  But this is a Disney movie and heck, a true story, so they do learn to respect each other. Then they learn to like each other. The result is a powerful, almost unstoppable high school football team.The players return to the real world to find that many of the citizens of Alexandria, the school's town, could have stood to go to Boone's camp themselves. The players overcome their first obstacle, their own fear. Now their new friendships will be put to the test by a backward society that hasn't had the benefit of the intensive bonding experience they just had. Some simply fear the team won't be as good as it was. This fear is quickly diminished. For some, though, it's just plain bigotry. Win or lose, they won't accept a group of black and white boys playing together as a team.Not only did this film come from the Mouse House, but it's also a Jerry Bruckheimer production. This strange combination has created a gritty film that's still family-friendly. Basically, they were trying to please everyone, young and old, male and female. For the most part, they succeed. Still, the Disney\/Bruckheimer factor does hurt it in many ways. The singing and dancing for instance, even if it did really happen, should have been left out. It makes nice footage to put in a trailer, but when inserted into the actual film, it ruins the overall tone. What hurts most though, is that there was no hope of giving it the ending it really needed, namely the Titans losing.Okay, I know it's a true story. But T.C. Williams was not the only high school that was created by forced integration. A bolder move would have been choosing a different such school, one whos football team wasn't all that successful. Really, the Titans go undefeated. For one thing, from a sports perspective, what fun is that? But most importantly, the dream season they had begs the question what if they'd lost a game or two? Or three? How would the town have felt about integration then? If the once-intolerant community still comes together across racial lines, it would mean more. All the film really shows is that that Alexandria is willing to accept integration--as long as the team remains as successful as it has been. What's worse is the film's tagline `History is written by the winners.' What, exactly, is this supposed to mean?Still, I recommend Remember the Titans ends up because it ends up being a pretty darn good sports movie. And even though its message could have been communicated even more powerfully, the film is more honest about the relationships between blacks and whites than maybe any other mass-market movie has been. Washington is great as usual, but the real stars are the young actors who play the Titans.Grade B  ","genre":null},{"date":"8 October 2000","score":"","review":"  Remember the Titans reminds us that fear is the only thing standing in the way of a society not divided across racial lines.

Like it or not, this is our team, is what he's saying to them. `I don't care if you like each other,' he tells them, `but you will respect each other.' At first, it looks like they'll do neither. Boone forces them to room with someone they don't know, which usually ends up being someone of a different race.  But this is a Disney movie and heck, a true story, so they do learn to respect each other. Then they learn to like each other. The result is a powerful, almost unstoppable high school football team.The players return to the real world to find that many of the citizens of Alexandria, the school's town, could have stood to go to Boone's camp themselves. The players overcome their first obstacle, their own fear. Now their new friendships will be put to the test by a backward society that hasn't had the benefit of the intensive bonding experience they just had. Some simply fear the team won't be as good as it was. This fear is quickly diminished. For some, though, it's just plain bigotry. Win or lose, they won't accept a group of black and white boys playing together as a team.Not only did this film come from the Mouse House, but it's also a Jerry Bruckheimer production. This strange combination has created a gritty film that's still family-friendly. Basically, they were trying to please everyone, young and old, male and female. For the most part, they succeed. Still, the Disney\/Bruckheimer factor does hurt it in many ways. The singing and dancing for instance, even if it did really happen, should have been left out. It makes nice footage to put in a trailer, but when inserted into the actual film, it ruins the overall tone. What hurts most though, is that there was no hope of giving it the ending it really needed, namely the Titans losing.Okay, I know it's a true story. But T.C. Williams was not the only high school that was created by forced integration. A bolder move would have been choosing a different such school, one whos football team wasn't all that successful. Really, the Titans go undefeated. For one thing, from a sports perspective, what fun is that? But most importantly, the dream season they had begs the question what if they'd lost a game or two? Or three? How would the town have felt about integration then? If the once-intolerant community still comes together across racial lines, it would mean more. All the film really shows is that that Alexandria is willing to accept integration--as long as the team remains as successful as it has been. What's worse is the film's tagline `History is written by the winners.' What, exactly, is this supposed to mean?Still, I recommend Remember the Titans ends up because it ends up being a pretty darn good sports movie. And even though its message could have been communicated even more powerfully, the film is more honest about the relationships between blacks and whites than maybe any other mass-market movie has been. Washington is great as usual, but the real stars are the young actors who play the Titans.Grade B  ","genre":"Biography, Drama, Sport"},{"date":"8 October 2000","score":"","review":"  Remember the Titans reminds us that fear is the only thing standing in the way of a society not divided across racial lines. We fear those who are different than us. We tend to reject what we don't understand.The film is about the redistricting and forced integration of two high schools in Virginia in 1971. An all-white football team that has had great success its past few seasons must now give up parts of its roster to players from the school it's merging with-who just happen to be all black. The white players have played under coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton), who is a nominee for the Virginia High School Football Hall of Fame. The school's athletic board, believing they can prove that integration is a bad idea, brings in Herman Boone (Denzel Washington), a black man, to replace him as head coach. They'll then sit and wait through training camp until Boone's team loses a game, then fire him. Yoast unexpectedly stays on as Boone's defensive coordinator, however, and they head for camp. Understandably, the white players have difficulty with the situation. They feel, justifiably, that their team was just fine the way it was. They know each other. They were winning.Another great point that Titans makes is that sometimes winning is not important. Coach Boone wants to win but, like all great coaches, he won't deny any kid who wants it the chance to compete and contribute. He designs the two-week training camp to force the boys to get to know each other.

It's because this is such a well-made movie...there is actually a story in this movie and it is told in a captivating way.  Nonetheless, the director, Roman Polanski added just the right amount of suspense and shock to make this a definite horror film.  He did not need to include any gory or intensely graphic scenes in this movie. Yet, the movie is scary enough. This movie stars the great Mia Farrow in an awesome, amazing performance. Angel-faced Mia, turns in a marvelous performance as the tragic heroine, Rosemary.  It was quite a feat for Mia, who was only 22 years old when she made this movie.  She's wonderful as the leading character in this movie, and her transformation in the movie from a doe-eyed beauty to a gaunt waif is startling.  John Cassavetes also does a good job playing Rosemary's ambitious husband who's willing to sell his soul to achieve success.  And, Ruth Gordon is superb as their eccentric, devil-worshipping older neighbor.  You can't help but feel for poor Rosemary.

It's horrible to know that she's surrounded by all of those occult-practicing people, yet she can't really do anything about it...she can only accept it.  One of the best things about this movie is the editing--I really liked the way that certain images were superimposed on some of the scenes.  It was like seeing a collage come to life.

I revere Bjork as a goddess, but this movie just didn't touch me.  Many actions of the characters seemed illogical (normally I don't mind this, but this was happening to the extreme), and contrived in the sense that I felt as though the director was trying desperately to make me feel sorry for the main character.The musical scenes were a refreshing and unique addition to the movie, although I was expecting an excellence of choreography and directing more along the lines of Bjork's It's Oh So Quiet music video; the musical numbers in this movie seemed very clunky in comparison to that masterpiece, but maybe they were supposed to be that way and I'm just missing the point of the film.  (On the other hand, maybe Spike Jonze--the director of It's Oh So Quiet--should've directed this.)The colors and texture of the video were also disappointing for me, but that was probably Von Trier's intention...  The muddy palette, along with the handheld camera and the digital video compression artifacts and the cut & paste style of editing made the film seem more like a documentary, and in that sense the realism was enhanced, but at the same time ... the colors were just so vomitous, and the poor quality of the digital video made it seem like the theatre was playing a pirated MPEG version of the movie off the Internet.  This isn't really a complaint; I guess it's just a matter of personal taste.Bjork's acting was superb, and so was her music.  In fact, I think everyone in the movie did a fine acting job--it's just the script that made the film seem illogical and contrived to me.Maybe my expectations for this movie were just way too high, or I was missing something crucial when I watched it.  Still, when I watch a very good tragedy, I don't only feel sorry for the main character, but I also feel like I've gotten this sort of portrait of humanity, or been given something to reflect on--at the very least, something more than simply feeling sorry for the protagonist.  With this movie, though, I just ended up wondering why the hell things hadn't gone differently, and as a result I felt as though the director had set up this crash course for Selma just so I could feel sorry for her, and nothing more.Still, maybe I'm just missing something and I need to see the film a second time to really appreciate it.
