A monument to everything I hate in Hollywood blockbuster trash. Noisy incomprehensible and some of the laziest acting by Sean Connery I've ever seen. The villain (Ed Harris &#150; a great actor completely wasted) is a highly-decorated (aren't they all in these sort of movies) US general who has taken over Alcatraz and is threatening to blow up San Francisco Bay area (pity that couldn't have been the Michael Bay area) unless $100 million is paid in ransom, as restitution to families of soldiers who died in secret operations. This is taking our compensation culture too far methinks. But that's Okay then as far as the plot is concerned as at least he's not doing out of any selfish motive and you cannot have a depiction of a really psychotically evil military man these days otherwise you might have the Right Wing reaching for their assault rifles. Of course the only man who can stop him is a geriatric prisoner (arise Sir Sean) a former Alcatraz escapee and you've guessed the rest. This movie is offensives on just about every level. The nadir of this film, which incidentally gave me the biggest snigger, was the line from Connery when he talks about his anxieties about making it sexually unmolested from the prison showers everyday. The idea that any prisoner no matter how perverted would be interested in Connerys flaccid old ass had me hooting. Is Connery now so old and senile as to not see how dumb and funny that line is. Or is it symptomatic of the hubris of elderly superstars that nobody tells you the obvious. Which is sad because Sean Connery always struck me as a pretty grounded individual with few airs (not to mention hairs) and graces?Rent the Sean Connery classic The Hill (1965) to see what a fine actor he can be and get this dire rubbish out of your system.

I definitely do not think The Princess Bride is a bad film, per se. I have heard it called all sorts of things, from a timeless classic to a great fantasy romp for all ages. Neither of those things are quite true. The film is as dated as most of the Nightmare On Elm Street episodes (especially the Clown Freddy ones). It also falls into the trap of trying to appeal to everyone, and as a result limiting its audience more than it otherwise would. But what it lacks in classic status, it (almost) makes up for in some other areas. On one hand, I can see why I was so reluctant to see the film when it was recommended to me around ten years ago. It was, after all, released in the same year as the holy chunk of awesome that is RoboCop. On the other hand, I can see why it was recommended to me on two occasions that span over a decade apart. I won't put this in my list of favourite films, but I admire it for its uniqueness among the fodder that was made in the same year.I will get the negatives out of the way, since they are the smaller part of this comment. The extraneous storyline involving Peter Falk playing a grandfather who reads this tale to his grandson, played with impeccable irritation by a very young Fred Savage, was utterly unnecessary. They get in the way of the story rather than enhancing it, especially when the action is interrupted to make some comment or to beat us over the head with how universal the story supposedly is. The characters are about as deep as a puddle, and we get no sense of why Westley loves Buttercup (or vice versa) so dearly. None of what passes for motivation or character development here is shown to us, it is all told. Some of the locations shown in the film have names so daft it will make your eye muscles twitch. Yes, there were names with a daft factor in adventure films like The Goonies (a far better children's adventure film in spite of what the IMDb would have you believe), but The Goonies succeeded in making the audience not notice (or care).Now that the problems are out of the way, let's concentrate for a moment of the film's strengths. Mandy Patinkin would have been a far better choice for the focal point of the story, as he runs with the campiness of the story at a speed that would impress Olympic champions. Christopher Guest portrays Patinkin's nemesis with a grace and, dare I say it, subtlety that could have worked wonders if it had transferred to the rest of the film. Robin Wright does the best she can with a very unidimensional role. She is mainly there to tell off the villain or beg for the hero's aid. The real jewel of the cast here is André the Giant, one of showbusiness' true well... gentle giants. As he is making comedy based around his knowledge of how big he is, the softer side of him that realises he is not in the best of health even for a forty-one year old shines through every time he delivers a line. Granted, one can only understand half of what he says at best. But of all the performers in the film, André is the one that will be remembered long after the rest have been forgotten.Some of the trick shots or effects sequences are lousy. The shrieking eels sequence was obviously meant to induce tension in the target audience, but even in five year olds, if the manner in which it is set up doesn't induce laughs or groans, the eels themselves surely will. Others, however, are very well-realised, and work well enough to make the film watchable. When André the Giant carries his castmates up the face of a cliff, one does not see whether it is just trick photography or a set, but it suspends disbelief enough to leave one in awe of the character. I don't know why the IMDb lists the stunt rider of André in the final ride-away scene as being obvious. Maybe I am not as cynical or jaded as I would like to believe, but this shot sold itself well enough that I could feel sorry for the horse. This, friends and neighbours, is a sign of a well-made film.In summation, The Princess Bride is a lot better than I thought it would be, but it is nowhere near as good as many make out. For fantasy adventures, I am far more inclined to recommend The Goonies, which is far more realistic in the sense of being less normalistic than is the case here.

I actually enjoy controversial pictures because they open my eyes and perspective about life to things I'd normally steer clear of. Well, out of the thousands of films I've viewed over the thirteen years I've been watching them (I'm fifteen) I don't remember seeing a movie more messed up, provocative and twisted then Todd Solondz's 'Happiness'. 'Happiness' is Solondz's second full-length feature (the first being the 1996 indie cult favorite 'Welcome to the Dollhouse'), and it puts a whole new spin on the 'Leave it to Beaver'-like suburban house life. This is one messed up feature film, and you know what, I absolutely loved it!It follows the Jordans, a family so screwed up it makes the Mansons look like the Bradys. The dysfunction begins with Joy Jordan (Jane Adams), a lonely and neurotic telemarketer who can never find a man. After she breaks up with Andy (SNL's Jon Lovitz), and he kills himself, she decides to teach at a DMV while it's going through a worker's union strike, and falls in love with a crazy Russian, Vlad (Jared Harris), only to find out he's married. The second of the Jordan children is Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle). She's a controversial novelist who writes about issues such as violent rape and child molestation, and is a sex addict. She's neighbors with a fat, lonely computer nerd, Allen (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who randomly selects women out of the New Jersey area phone book at attempts to have phone sex with them, and, a sad, obese woman, Kristina (Camryn Manheim), with a deadly secret. The third Jordan child is Trish (Cynthia Stevensen), the typical nosy, loud-mouthed and hypocritical suburban housewife, whose husband, Bill Maplewood (Dylan Baker), is a psychiatrist, whose also a homosexual pedophile who dreams of mass suicide in public parks and falls in love with his 11-year-old son, Billy's (Rufus Read), best friend. Billy is also having a certain problem almost every teenage boy comes across, and who better to talk and help him through it then his father, a pedophilia maniac. Then comes the Jordan's parents, Mona (Louise Lasser) and Lenny (Ben Gazzara). Lenny tells Mona he wants to split up because he isn't in love with her anymore, and seeks love from a Joan Rivers like senior citizen, Diane Freed (Elizabeth Ashley). Mona has a hard time dealing with this and almost looses her mind. How's that for a f*cked up family!!!'Happiness' is almost too screwed up for words. It takes all these disgusting and hard to stomach situations, and puts a comical twist on them. Only Todd Solondz has the cajones to do this, and I salute him for it. The main attraction of course in 'Happiness' is the writing. The screenplay was the best of that year, and I am absolutely appalled it didn't win any awards. It's very intricate, bold, daring and it contains some of the most original and down-right frightening conversations between characters that you will ever see. The acting is astounding too. Dylan Baker gives perhaps the best performance of the film as the manic pedophile\/ psychiatrist. Baker proves himself an actor in leagues of performers such as Brando, Pacino, and Nicholson.

I actually enjoy controversial pictures because they open my eyes and perspective about life to things I'd normally steer clear of. Well, out of the thousands of films I've viewed over the thirteen years I've been watching them (I'm fifteen) I don't remember seeing a movie more messed up, provocative and twisted then Todd Solondz's 'Happiness'. 'Happiness' is Solondz's second full-length feature (the first being the 1996 indie cult favorite 'Welcome to the Dollhouse'), and it puts a whole new spin on the 'Leave it to Beaver'-like suburban house life. This is one messed up feature film, and you know what, I absolutely loved it!It follows the Jordans, a family so screwed up it makes the Mansons look like the Bradys. The dysfunction begins with Joy Jordan (Jane Adams), a lonely and neurotic telemarketer who can never find a man. After she breaks up with Andy (SNL's Jon Lovitz), and he kills himself, she decides to teach at a DMV while it's going through a worker's union strike, and falls in love with a crazy Russian, Vlad (Jared Harris), only to find out he's married. The second of the Jordan children is Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle). She's a controversial novelist who writes about issues such as violent rape and child molestation, and is a sex addict. She's neighbors with a fat, lonely computer nerd, Allen (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who randomly selects women out of the New Jersey area phone book at attempts to have phone sex with them, and, a sad, obese woman, Kristina (Camryn Manheim), with a deadly secret. The third Jordan child is Trish (Cynthia Stevensen), the typical nosy, loud-mouthed and hypocritical suburban housewife, whose husband, Bill Maplewood (Dylan Baker), is a psychiatrist, whose also a homosexual pedophile who dreams of mass suicide in public parks and falls in love with his 11-year-old son, Billy's (Rufus Read), best friend. Billy is also having a certain problem almost every teenage boy comes across, and who better to talk and help him through it then his father, a pedophilia maniac. Then comes the Jordan's parents, Mona (Louise Lasser) and Lenny (Ben Gazzara). Lenny tells Mona he wants to split up because he isn't in love with her anymore, and seeks love from a Joan Rivers like senior citizen, Diane Freed (Elizabeth Ashley). Mona has a hard time dealing with this and almost looses her mind. How's that for a f*cked up family!!!'Happiness' is almost too screwed up for words. It takes all these disgusting and hard to stomach situations, and puts a comical twist on them. Only Todd Solondz has the cajones to do this, and I salute him for it. The main attraction of course in 'Happiness' is the writing. The screenplay was the best of that year, and I am absolutely appalled it didn't win any awards. It's very intricate, bold, daring and it contains some of the most original and down-right frightening conversations between characters that you will ever see. The acting is astounding too. Dylan Baker gives perhaps the best performance of the film as the manic pedophile\/ psychiatrist. Baker proves himself an actor in leagues of performers such as Brando, Pacino, and Nicholson.

Nostalgia is a wonderful thing, and seeing how the principal cast had aged (or hardly aged in Josh Brolin's case) was worth the price of admission on its own. But this is just one of The Goonies' selling points. Despite what the IMDb's ratings would have you believe, it is an immortal classic that warrants repeated and frequent viewings. It is not a coincidence that many of its cast and crew have repeatedly appeared in all sorts of productions before and since. Indeed, this was probably the first film that introduced me to the reality that the same actor will often play ten different parts in ten different films when I realised that Jonathan Ke Quan was the same brat that made parts of Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom so amusing. Seeing him in the video-enhanced commentary of the DVD nearly two decades later was a surprise and a half.The film revolves around a group of children and adolescents who live in the poorer, less trendy part of a beachfront town. Unlike an episode of Barney, every member of this principal group is given a background and a string of differences from their castmates. You will not see the teenaged Brand responding to the same situation in the same manner as the ten year old Mikey, and that is where a major part of the film's strength is derived. The only weakness in the characterisations is with Martha Plimpton and Kerri Green, who join the adventuring boys a little way into the film. Exactly what they are doing other than giving the character of Brand something similar to himself to bounce his more adult-oriented lines from is anyone's guess, but they do work in their limited capacity. It is just a pity that Chris Columbus' screenplay did not give them a little more to do, other than defuse one fiendish trap towards the end of the ride.Speaking of fiendish traps, the adventurers journey from one puzzling location to the next with barely a stop for breath. It works because unlike similar adventure films where the director expects us to be impressed by a fiendish-sounding name, the specific places that are visited by the Goonies have function. The bone piano shown in one such sequence, for example, would appear in the nightmares of children learning a regular piano for years after the film's theatrical release. It also gives Corey Feldman a good chance to act out a character who speaks very fluent Spanish. And while I am on that subject, who could forget the immortal scene early on in the film where Mouth deliberately loses something in the translation when Rosalita is shown around? But the prize for scene-stealing goes to John Matuszak, who plays the unofficial eighth Goonie, Sloth, with a weird aplomb that may well scare the willies out of parts of the intended audience. But then, in 1985, scaring the intended audience a little was considered a healthy part of making a film for those in the age ranges depicted here.They say you cannot have a good protagonist without a good antagonist to bounce off. Robert Davi, Joe Pantoliano, and Anne Ramsey provide antagonists so good that they utterly hose the rule about not working with animals or children. The Fratellis work so well here because they are working with children. The late Anne Ramsey played her part so well that the mere thought of watching her in anything scared the willies out of me for years. Nowadays, as I have fully realised the mechanics behind film for some years, I am keen as mustard to see some of her other work in such pieces as Throw Momma From The Train (now there's a title that brings images to mind) or Meet the Hollowheads. That a performance can produce two entirely different reactions in the same person at different stages of their life should tell you all you need to know about its quality. Robert Davi and Joe Pantoliano are somewhat overshadowed here, but the manic, cackling quality of their introductory act also left quite a lasting impression.You might have noticed that I have so far only mentioned the special effects in passing while heaping praise upon the acting. This is because unlike films such as the recent Star Wars prequels, the effects complement the acting rather than overshadow it. From what I am able to tell, all of the effects in The Goonies are practical, and some of them quite inventive. There is no use of blood squibs, which may disappoint some viewers, but there are enough mechanical sets and air vents to fill three films. Some of these effects did not turn out so well and were cut from the final film (the squid sequence being the most famous example), but unlike a lot of films that depend on special effects for a crucial element, everything shown in the final cut is in perfect sync here. Suspension of disbelief is never an issue, which is just as well considering some of the preposterous things that roll by the screen with a certain nonchalance.I gave The Goonies a ten out of ten. Like Superman or the original Lethal Weapon, it shows that Richard Donner knows how to make a classic. Now that it is twenty years old, it stands forever as a relic of a time when the world of those under the age of eighteen was far less oppressive.

This thing follows them everywhere they go, they cannot escape it's presence and yet in The lost world (the same island) do you see it once? do you hear it? does anyone even MENTION it? NO! Its ridiculous!. The star character in the previous 2 movies was, and always will be the T-Rex so what does the d(urr)irector Joe Johnston go and do? Kill it off! as soon as you see the huge T-Rex in all its awesome roaring glory it gets killed and you never see it again - a new Dino on the town is the excuse.. where did it come from!!?? not a single explanation! and don't get me started on the whole satellite-phone-in-the-Dino-belly thing! 2)Just when you start to get over how stupid the Spinosaurus is you see the Raptors, Aside from their new Punk Haircuts they seem pretty credible! *Phew* they will make this movie watchable right?... WRONG! now they speak to each other!! and the excuse for them speaking in this film and not in the First and second are...wait for it... Evolution! - yes the process of millions of years in just a few months from when the second movie ended, amazing! surly they should have grown opposable thumbs and created tools by now!!

Today, in this age where one can read stories on subject matters discussed by the characters in this film (or even that which the film is based around) with the click of a button, the premise is utterly passé. That it could have attracted so much attention in the US market in 1989 reveals how America's citizenry was more tightly repressed than Ann. The cast is minuscule by most standards, and there really are only four stars to speak of. The fact that half of them are about as charismatic as a puddle does not help. That I remember Earl T. Taylor's performance more clearly than James Spader's or Andie MacDowell's is not the best of signs. I am starting to believe that Jennifer Jason Leigh is glad she missed the opportunity to appear here.I can handle films that consist of long conversations between several pairs of characters, and I can even handle films that consist of interview footage. What I cannot handle is a film partially comprised of interview footage that is so predictable and monotonous that one can guess what the character is going to say before the question is asked. It is not until about sixty-odd minutes into the film when Ann finds the evidence of Graham's affair with Cynthia that she has been challenged to produce that any spark of interest in the story is generated. By then, it is too late because most of the characters concerned are less than uncompelling. It is not the fault of the actors, as they seem perfectly competent. It is just that the characters they inhabit, the story they are telling, and the film's framing of both, have little to recommend them.The music by Cliff Martinez attempts to inject some sliver of tension into the proceedings, but it instead succeeds in being annoying. If it could be more stilted or obvious, I do not know how. Clearly, the hearts of the composer and director were in the right place, but the result is about as interesting as a wet sock. If the film is trying to make the point that conversation is more satisfying than sex, then it has missed the mark. The conversations are flat and pointless, and the characters are as deep as a compact disc. I have never enjoyed a performance by Andie MacDowell, Groundhog Day notwithstanding. Even in Hudson Hawk, she manages to suck all the life and fun out of her character. Peter Gallagher is about as likable as a stomach ulcer, and James Spader's charisma vortex was pretty much confirmed thirteen years later in Secretary.If the film does have a saving grace, it is the serpent-like performance from Laura San Giacomo.

She is beautiful enough to hook the men in the audience, unlike the woman playing her on-screen sister, and her performance is based around the knowledge of this fact. In every scene she plays, she steals the show. The fact that she cares enough about other people in her offscreen life, at least if the stories about her campaigning for inclusive educational opportunities for all children are to be believed, gives every character she portrays, including this one, a certain soul that those who occupy Sex, Lies, And Videotape with her lack. In essence, she is the heart of this film. No, let me rephrase that, she is the heart, brains, lungs, and many other things of a story whose cast of characters seem so utterly lacking it makes the attempts at pop psychology seem like they would be laughable if they were not so utterly sad.Out of ten, I gave Sex, Lies, And Videotape a five. Those five points are for Laura San Giacomo alone. Having seen this film twice on occasions about five to ten years apart, I can honestly say I never saw what all the fuss was about.

You do forget how old they are meant to be in the film, obviously because you know in real life they are older, but also because of the language and the sexual side of it. It has a great story line and has its funny moments, this film makes you feel a lot of different emotions. I loved Sebastian from the start but your meant to think of someone who's is only really sexually driven using girls for his pleasure. Kathryn is the manipulative evil step sister. When Annette comes on the scene a sweet innocent girl who's saving herself for when shes married and is also the new headmasters daughter, Sebastian has intentions to seduce her and change her vows about sex before marriage. Sebastian and Kathryn make a bet and his challenge begins. There are two other characters to this story to make it even more interesting, Cecile who will be another new member to their school who Kathryn 'takes under her wing' is really quite dumb and vulnerable, she does what Kathryn says. Cecile falls for her music teacher, Kathryn sees it as a chance to stir things up, there is yet another story behind this. Sebastian ends up helping Kathryn by 'helping' Cecile in her sexual life, giving her experience to impress her music teacher. This all ends up with a sad and twisted ending as everyone finds out about Cecile and him, and Annette finds out about the bet. Sebastian goes from this manipulative and ruthless person just trying to win his bet to a soppy, sensitive boy who falls in love. You go from thinking he a sleaze to loving him feeling sorry for him. Its a fab story with a lot more to it than you think, you will never be bored with this film it is thrilling and intriguing from the very first scene to the last.

Definitely Ryan Philippe's best film and probably the only film i think Sarah Michelle geller is good in. You do forget how old they are meant to be in the film, obviously because you know in real life they are older, but also because of the language and the sexual side of it. It has a great story line and has its funny moments, this film makes you feel a lot of different emotions. I loved Sebastian from the start but your meant to think of someone who's is only really sexually driven using girls for his pleasure. Kathryn is the manipulative evil step sister. When Annette comes on the scene a sweet innocent girl who's saving herself for when shes married and is also the new headmasters daughter, Sebastian has intentions to seduce her and change her vows about sex before marriage. Sebastian and Kathryn make a bet and his challenge begins. There are two other characters to this story to make it even more interesting, Cecile who will be another new member to their school who Kathryn 'takes under her wing' is really quite dumb and vulnerable, she does what Kathryn says. Cecile falls for her music teacher, Kathryn sees it as a chance to stir things up, there is yet another story behind this. Sebastian ends up helping Kathryn by 'helping' Cecile in her sexual life, giving her experience to impress her music teacher.

It is truly very European in its make-upthe hero of the film is hardly an exemplary figure and the situations are dreary and morally difficult to make absolute. In other words,this is probably not the kind of film you'd find Michael Medved recommending.Alex(a young Malcolm MacDowall,Sting look-alike)and his cronies--his droogs--spend an average evening in bars drinking a milk-based narcotic that makes them more rowdy and violent. On one particular evening,they kick the snot out of a homeless man,get in a fight with a rival gang of droogs and end up pillaging and raping a rich old man and his young wife in his mansion.On another evening,Alex and his mates decide they'll try to rob a little old lady in her apartment. When the burglary goes awry,his mates abandon him and he ends up killing the woman,Alex is arrested and taken away to prison. From there,he learns to become a model prisoner in order to get fast-tracked for a form of prisoner medical experimentation. Little does he realize(until it's too late)that the experimentation that he's been sold on,to cure his violent urges,is a draconian and brutal form of mental reprogramming involving mind-altering drugs and forced film-viewing.Once released back into the world,Alex may no longer be violent,but that proves of absolutely no help to him as he tries to quietly reenter the society.The book is a little harder to digest,but still is brilliantly written,so this movie actually gives flesh to the images and ideas created in it. I liken that to American Psycho,only in that case I found the movie actually an IMPROVEMENT over the book. Kubrick seems very much at home with this grim,futuristic cautionary tale. It dovetails nicely with the film he did previously,a little experimental ditty called 2001A Space Odyssey,also set in the future but comparatively sterile and detached when contrasted to Clockwork. MacDowall,who rarely(if ever)commands leading roles anymore,is superb as the lead character,who is detestable,lovable,pathetic and sympathetic ALL in the same film. Not necessarily a must-see,but a deserved memorable offering at that.

The characters must be the most ordinary, normal-looking bunch of dregs ever put together in a movie, full of resourcefulness and wit to overcome all their problems through some hilarious solutions.The plot is remarkable straightforward, a testimony to the skills of Simon Beaufoy, who can weave an interesting story without too much complexity and twists. Six unemployed men decide to organize a one-night strip-tease show to make money, and the catch is that they'll go completely naked just to get an edge on traditional male strippers. The story focus especially on Gaz, who needs 700 pounds to win custody rights over his son Nathan; then there's Dave, a man who has issues about his fatness; Gerald, Gaz's and Dave's former boss; the suicidal Lomper; Guy, the only one doesn't have a problem about showing everything, only he can't dance; and Horse, who tries to live up to his name.Robert Carlyle is undeniably wonderful in this movie! I loved his Begbie character in 'Trainspotting;' Begbie is in fact one of my all-time favorite characters and he says some of my all-time favorite lines in cinema; and Carlyle is just as great playing Gaz. Mark Addy isn't any worst, and then there's the mighty Tom Wilkinson, great as usual, possibly the only actor of the bunch who seized the opportunity to make it big in Hollywood.I love 'The Full Monty' because amidst the jokes the director Peter Cattaneo and screenwriter Simon Beaufoy manage to challenge lots of traditional values and stereotypes. Machismo is quite the target here as Gaz and his crew are forced to perform a profession that for them is only suitable for women. The way Gaz makes fun of male strippers at the beginning of the movie is a clear evidence of what a blow the whole show is on their male egos. Then they begin to see themselves from the point of view of women for the first time in their lives they will know what it is to be seen just as a sex object. All of a sudden their game of giving a mark from 1 to 10 to each woman they saw on the street blows right in their face. And Horse's dilemma is just wonderful being a black man called Horse, everyone else thinks he is well-endowed, only he's not, and it makes for one of the funniest scenes in the movie.In the end, though, the movie is really about unemployment and how it forces people to do things they otherwise would not do. One can see these are desperate men in pretty tight spots; my heart is especially with Gerald, a middle-aged man who's to embarrassed to tell his wife he's lost his job so he keeps pretending he has one for six months and keeps going out in the morning every day to 'work,' when in fact he goes to the job center.

That's one area where it has a lot of charm. This film features the classic heist of course, but truly focuses more on the relationships of the characters, which is where it gets its noir aspects. Hayden and Hagen's characters have a particularly intriguing relationship. Hagen is great in a very non-fatale role -- more reminiscent of the characters that Claire Trevor played for many years. Calhern is at his best here, absolutely convincing us he's the type of pathetic man who would attempt a double-cross. Also features an early cameo by Marilyn Monroe, very attractive here and in a suitable role.p.s. additional comments 10\/5\/07This is one of John Huston's best films, admirable for excellent performances and a nearly perfect economy of storytelling. There are many interesting angles to cover when looking at this film &#150; each character could almost be the star of his or her own movie, right down to minor ones like the cop Ditrich (Barry Kelley) and desperately needy but sweet glamour girl Angela (Marilyn Monroe). In fact in the end the main thing I take from this film, other than the pleasure of the heist and its tragic consequences, is this sense that each character has his or her own great weakness but also great potential, so that in the end the tragedy of the dissolving caper is heightened enormously by these contradicting motives and desires. For example I just love the resolution for Dr. Reidenschneider (Sam Jaffe), taken to prison because he spent a few extra minutes watching a teenage girl shake her hips to the jukebox. And it's absolutely delicious to watch the transition that Louis Calhern affects (as the bankroller\/traitor Lon Emmerich) after his accomplice is easily dispatched by hooligan Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden). Hayden is thought of by many, perhaps even among his admirers, as a one-note performer. But he plays that one note so well that when the role is right, as it is here, he's absolutely the best thing in the movie. I really like his chemistry with Jean Hagen, who plays a kind of girlfriend of his. I find it intriguing how so many people dismiss him by using the word hooligan as a kind of generic sobriquet&#133; also Emmerich's accomplice calls him a hick. The only characters who treat Dix as an individual instead of a type are Doll (Hagen), Gus (James Whitemore) and Reidenschneider. It was the doctor's idea to involve Dix in the heist, and it's clear he was impressed with Dix's candor and pride when humiliated by the small-time hustler &#150; He sees Dix right away as someone who will not tolerate foul play and enlists him to help ensure that Emmerich will pay. The upper-class characters speak very derisively about Dix whenever he's not around, almost portraying him in an inhuman way. And then most surprising (and to me, pleasing) of all even the Police Commissioner (John McIntyre) speaks about him in a way that is totally dehumanizing. He gives a long speech towards the very end which sounds very impressive but is thoroughly stupid if you think about it &#150; basically the whole point of his speech is that we shouldn't complain about corrupt policemen because we'd be a lot worse off if there were no police at all. As if no middle ground exists! Huston actually subverts the direct effect of this speech by having the Commish immediately disparage Dix as a person, saying he is a hooligan (there's that word again) and that he has no feelings, no emotions, something that we the audience know to be completely untrue and which is starkly contradicted by the very next scene. The amount of depth that this type of writing brings to the story is impossible to exaggerate.

That's one area where it has a lot of charm. This film features the classic heist of course, but truly focuses more on the relationships of the characters, which is where it gets its noir aspects. Hayden and Hagen's characters have a particularly intriguing relationship. Hagen is great in a very non-fatale role -- more reminiscent of the characters that Claire Trevor played for many years. Calhern is at his best here, absolutely convincing us he's the type of pathetic man who would attempt a double-cross. Also features an early cameo by Marilyn Monroe, very attractive here and in a suitable role.p.s. additional comments 10\/5\/07This is one of John Huston's best films, admirable for excellent performances and a nearly perfect economy of storytelling. There are many interesting angles to cover when looking at this film &#150; each character could almost be the star of his or her own movie, right down to minor ones like the cop Ditrich (Barry Kelley) and desperately needy but sweet glamour girl Angela (Marilyn Monroe). In fact in the end the main thing I take from this film, other than the pleasure of the heist and its tragic consequences, is this sense that each character has his or her own great weakness but also great potential, so that in the end the tragedy of the dissolving caper is heightened enormously by these contradicting motives and desires. For example I just love the resolution for Dr. Reidenschneider (Sam Jaffe), taken to prison because he spent a few extra minutes watching a teenage girl shake her hips to the jukebox. And it's absolutely delicious to watch the transition that Louis Calhern affects (as the bankroller\/traitor Lon Emmerich) after his accomplice is easily dispatched by hooligan Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden). Hayden is thought of by many, perhaps even among his admirers, as a one-note performer. But he plays that one note so well that when the role is right, as it is here, he's absolutely the best thing in the movie. I really like his chemistry with Jean Hagen, who plays a kind of girlfriend of his. I find it intriguing how so many people dismiss him by using the word hooligan as a kind of generic sobriquet&#133; also Emmerich's accomplice calls him a hick. The only characters who treat Dix as an individual instead of a type are Doll (Hagen), Gus (James Whitemore) and Reidenschneider. It was the doctor's idea to involve Dix in the heist, and it's clear he was impressed with Dix's candor and pride when humiliated by the small-time hustler &#150; He sees Dix right away as someone who will not tolerate foul play and enlists him to help ensure that Emmerich will pay. The upper-class characters speak very derisively about Dix whenever he's not around, almost portraying him in an inhuman way. And then most surprising (and to me, pleasing) of all even the Police Commissioner (John McIntyre) speaks about him in a way that is totally dehumanizing. He gives a long speech towards the very end which sounds very impressive but is thoroughly stupid if you think about it &#150; basically the whole point of his speech is that we shouldn't complain about corrupt policemen because we'd be a lot worse off if there were no police at all. As if no middle ground exists! Huston actually subverts the direct effect of this speech by having the Commish immediately disparage Dix as a person, saying he is a hooligan (there's that word again) and that he has no feelings, no emotions, something that we the audience know to be completely untrue and which is starkly contradicted by the very next scene. The amount of depth that this type of writing brings to the story is impossible to exaggerate.

It captivated me, since I was subjected to a movie diet of Disney and Star Wars, so this was cutting-edge SCARE--EEY !!! I saw this subsequent times in the theatre (I think 3) and then rented it umpteen amount of times when it was on videocassette. But then a year later I saw the re-release of Jaws, and there was no comparison. That and the fact I had a few more movies under my belt by then, so Jaws 2 was beginning to underwhelm me. Still, if you dissect the sequel, it's not good, but it is watchable to a degree. Roy Scheider does what he can with such a weak script (and God, the dialogue sounded like lines from the new Star Wars movies at times). There is hardly a climax, but they still managed to integrate a little suspense (even though they shot themselves in the foot by showing plenty of the shark from the beginning). Was hardly any blood in this movie, but it had a higher body count. The editors\/producers had the contrived motion picture formula down to a science.Now in my thirties, I bought this film on DVD to cruise Memory Lane whenever I was sick or bored enough. The special features to me were better than the film IMO, and it wasn't until then I was picking this film apart and watching it objectively. And did I. The dialogue was water-logged, and I don't think even the magic of Steven Spielberg could of resuscitated this fish tail (remember 1941?). This was doomed from the beginning, and classic films like Jaws should never have sequels. Actually, this was one of the first films to template the teen-ager slasher films of the late '70s\/early '80s. As I had mentioned above, this had it's moments, and I am still haunted from the images of watching Tina's boyfriend (Eddie) die along with the shark swallowing the teen-age chick whole (the one who rescues little Sean Brody). They weren't all that bloody, but the imagination turns on as you think about just how long did it take for that girl to die afterwards. Or just what did the shark devour before finishing off Eddie? I even thought the napalm woman who burned up died a pretty horrible death. And that was 1978 where special effects were by no means sophisticated like they are now, and the imagination was more in the front seat back then. But if they hired some better writers and maybe some better actors, we would of cared more for some of those bantering, loud, and unlikable teen-agers (who looked like they were really in their twenties). If Universal wasn't in such a hurry to get this made, we may have had a more elaborate story (not to mention a possible triumphant return of Steven Spielberg & Richard Dreyfus). I'm all alone out here! DUH !GO AWAY !Sometimes some of the most beautiful girls are the loneliest... -That's a crock of sh*t ! I know, I know...?????????!!!!!!!!!One good bite deserves another. Well, if you take another bite sometimes you might taste a worm.

The dialogue between the two, which starts out as sort of a teasing banter, and grows more serious at a pace perfectly commanded by master director Kazan. Is realistic and spaced nicely. At one point early in the film Terry says 'I bet you don't remember me do you?' Saint replies with the perfectly delivered line. 'I remember the first time I ever saw you.'
