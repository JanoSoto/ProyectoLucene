Shackelton was an adventurer looking for greatness in perhaps the last great uncharted portion of the earth at that time. He set out with 27 other adventurous young men (mostly from the UK) in a modest ship bound for the icy world of Antarctica. Their goal, once they got there, would be to walk across the continent and claim it for England. The South Pole had already been discovered, but apparently that was not enough to stake a claim to the entire continent at that time. Shackleton is described as a man who admittedly was not really good at anything. He was simply looking for prominence in one of the last places one could find it at that time. The crew, an assortment of various sailors and craftsmen, were warned of the dangers and low pay of such a venture. However the chance of gaining acclaim for accomplishing such a feat was enough to get hundreds of men to sign up. The crew were chosen and the boat was set to sail at the outset of WWI. Shackleton actually offered to postpone his mission and donate his ship The Endurance to the war effort, but the government let him go, anyway. Ironically, the ship never even made it to Antacrtica before things went to hell. Nobody from this party ever set foot on the continent.About 100 miles from the coast, the boat became hopelessly stuck in pack ice. Shackleton made the decision to wait until the following spring when the ice would break up to resume the trip. Before spring could come, however, The Endurance would be crushed by the ice. The crew were forced to shoot their sled dogs to save food rations. The last of the dogs were actually eaten by the crew. The crew were forced to then drag the remaining life boats several miles to open water where they would then have to island-hop their way to civilization in some of the coldest and most choppy seas on earth. Along the way, the group is splintered in three parts, as it just becomes impossible to transport so many men in the tiny lifeboats. Somehow, over the span of nearly two years, Shackleton and his men are eventually all rescued. There are some incredible individual acts of heroism, and even an odd case of mutiny along the way. But Shackleton's leadership and confidence always seems to keep the group alive.Once the men return home, they find that their own heroism has been dwarfed by so many men who had given their lives on the battlefields of WWI. Many of Shackleton's crew enlist in the army to almost certain death, and one is left to wonder about the logic behind it all. To stay alive through impossible circumstances for nearly two years, then go out and give your life for one of the most pointless conflicts in human history? People's attitudes must have been somewhat different back then.The film is a visual treat. Still and moving footage from the actual expedition is inter-cut with current shots of the areas these men traveled through. The scenery is breathtaking, and you get a real feel for how desperate these mens' circumstances really were. Liam Neeson narrates, and he gives the material even further dignity. After watching the film, you can't help but realize how insignificant we humans are in the scope of the natural world. How any of these men made it back alive is a miracle.

It's goes beyond formula into something that challenged me, the interplay between the forces of nature where sometimes the seemingly 'good' side is not what it seems, until the bigger, darker picture comes into view. It's a purely imaginative effort, with a level of dramatic- more over cinematic- power that I'd compare with Kurosawa on a level. Princess Mononoke, in its uncompromising way, details the violence without pulling away while also being rather anti-violent in the process. It is also hard to pinpoint on any one level. Visually it's got so much going on to practically experience the abstractions that Hayao Miyazaki folds up into the rest of the story. The story itself trails along with the best of epic fantasy, with this crucial, earth-shattering quest that works on that level of action-adventure (possibly more for adults despite the PG-13 rating here in the States) as well as the mythological side of things. Some have written that it is a bit of a complex film in structure and storytelling, bordering on confusing. I would disagree, though I can see what they mean- you have to pay closer attention than usual of more American films. But on a more profound level, if one could call it such, it's really not hard to follow.The hero of the film, interesting enough, is the type of tragic hero, though with one clear sight amid the chaos on the two sides he encounters- peace. He is cursed by a sort of wormy-jelly demon that runs unyielding in the darker recesses of the world. He searches for something to rid him of his scars while on the human side at some points (mostly dominated by the women impressed- or against- his skills), and with those of the wolves on the other side.

Then there are also the boars ready to destroy the humans, even to their demise. Amid the battles that rage on, leading to the significance of a certain 'Deer God' as the centerpiece of the balance of the forests and civilizations, not too much is made explicit. At the same time, the side taken by the cursed hero is even questioned by one character, and with that part connected with the others the story trumps what could have been a kind of smothering over-symbolic representation into what is necessary and spectacular about the film.In fact, I would estimate on just the near bravery of what Miyazaki is achieving in the film, it's one of the best films of its kind. And 'of its kind' in this case is the animated film that breaks conventions and the typical 'good vs. evil' logic. Many times the suddenness of things had me wide-eyed, and each creature or little variance on the creations- both good and evil- are elaborated with out compromise. The digitally-animated worm-Jelly type monsters are some of the more memorable ones, to be sure, as they book-end the picture in different extraordinary ways (the climax in particular probably ranks with the best of the last decade or so). The tiny bobble-headed alien creatures are also a delight as they rattle and gather and multiply and flee all around; this is the kind of scene that is dream-like to a truly weird and bright sensibility. And many scenes that have more of that samurai-movie quality to them (again, Kurosawa) are extremely well-done on their own as then they become mixed around again with the fantasy elements.To say that the film is really a 'family' film might be not entirely accurate, as some of the battle and attack footage is pretty graphic in its own ways, if not as much as other more adult anime like Fist of the North Star or Ninja Scroll.

Hired to do a job for the Director, Robert Duvall, in San Francisco Harry and his assistant Stan, John Cazale, have Ann & Mark, Cindy Williams & Fredrick Forrest, staked out with a number of bugging devices as well as men on the scene in this park picking up everything that the couple says.This assignment is no big deal for Harry since he's done far bigger jobs over the years making him the #1 bugger on the west coast if not the entire country or even the world. What we at the time don't know, and are soon to find out, is that Harry has a very guilty conscience coupled with his being a very serious and observant Catholic about an event that has been burning up insides him. Harry pulled off an almost impossible spying job, that made him the legend in the spying business that he is now back in the summer of 1968 a job that cost the lives of three innocent people.Checking out the tapes on Ann and her husband Mark Harry picks up, after cleaning out the background noises, Mark saying  he'll kill us if he got the chance and goes into a panic. Harry feels that he's somehow setting up the two to be murdered by the Director.

Paulie (Perabo) is an outspoken girl with a troubled past, and Tori is a privileged girl from a more traditional family.The first time Mary catches Paulie and Tori kissing on a rooftop in the middle of the night, she assumes they are only practicing for future encounters with boys.

Mary accepts their relationship, and the three seem on their way to being good friends.

Notice the agony on her face after she walks away from explaining to her little sister how there's nothing between herself and Paulie.

You'd already assured your place in cinematic history with a string of great films in the 1970s and some adventurous, stagy productions during the 1980s. You'd even staged a comeback of sorts with the bitingly funny The Player. You could have rested on your laurels. Instead, you made your most ambitious and rewarding film if not your greatest. I cannot tell you how many times I've promised myself I'd only watch half of it and then head to bed; I cannot tell you how many hours I've spent engrossed in the trials and tribulations faced by these various couplings and families over the course of a few days. Would I give any of those hours spent in the dark back? Never. Sincerely, Jason ForesteinShort Cuts is among my favorite Altman films (quite possibly my favorite) and among my favorite films of all time. It's three-plus hours unfold smoothly in an amazing display of editing and pacing. I've seen 80 minute movies that are interminable, yet I often want to start Short Cuts over as soon as it's finished. It's simply amazing on every level. First, and foremost, there's Altman's direction, which is at the top of its form here. Yes, The Player is a fantastic satire (and really really funny), but Short Cuts has the subdued cinematography and jazzy editing we've come to expect from an Altman film. It also, of course, has the requisite layered conversations. Like Nashville, Short Cuts is the definition of an ensemble piece, where no character takes precedence over any other. There are, I think, more than 20 characters integral to the stories in one form or another and Altman has the unimaginable ability to give them all enough space to come to life. You do not feel that there is a single two-dimensional character in the bunch; that's a major achievement. Then, you have amazing performances from the usual suspects (Time Robbins, Lily Tomlin, Jack Lemmon, and Robert Downey Jr.) as well as amazing performances from some soon-to-be household names (Lili Taylor, Frances McDormand, and Julianne Moore). This doesn't even count the wonderful turns from the criminally underrated Fred Ward, Tom Waits, Chris Penn, Peter Gallagher, and Matthew Modine. Huey Lewis even delivers a reputable performance. Like Gosford Park and Nashville, the ensemble is perfectly cast and they all perform above and beyond what is necessary. You expect a few duds (like, say, Robin Williams in Branagh's Hamlet); you don't expect perfect characterizations from everyone--especially when you have at least three musician- cum-actors. The writing is also superb. Sure, Altman was working from stories by Raymond Carver (who you all should go out and read immediately), but the tales were not told by Carver in such an inter-related fashion. He wrote short story collections not connected short story collections. Thematically, his tales resonated with one another, but there was not the crossing-over that takes place here. Altman and Barhydt do a simply amazing job translating those tales to the screen (they also do a commendable job translating from the Pacific Northwest to Los Angeles). Short Cuts is an ambitious film that, in the hands of a lesser director, would have likely lost its way. It's probably not perfect (is any film perfect?), but it comes as close to perfection as any film can. It's one of a kind and a film that has had its own effect on cinematic history (Magnolia and Crash crib, to a degree, from this film). It's a monumental achievement and beautiful and wonderful and I love it.

It's not as if its flaws are hard to detect, the main one being that it clearly set out to be a knock-'em-dead comedy and it just isn't. It seems to me that Stanley Kramer didn't really know what he had with the William and Tania Rose script and story. William Rose created THE LADYKILLERS (the original, not the Coen Brothers rehash), and there's a dark tone to that earlier movie which is also in MAD WORLD; a kind of amazement at what people will do for money. It's in that look on Tracy's face as the money is being dug up, as he watches this zany bunch licking their lips in anticipation of the treasure...Kramer went for slapstick rather than darkness. I don't blame him. But he would have made a better movie if he'd followed Alex MacKendrick's example on LADYKILLERS, and made it crazy rather than zany.Having said all that - what this movie has got is its amazing cast. When I first saw it, I was 10 years old, in Cinerama at the London Coliseum. At that time I only really knew of Terry-Thomas (he was English, after all!), Phil Silvers (Bilko had been a big hit in the UK), Dorothy Provine (THE ROARING TWENTIES had also been a great hit) and Tracy (because he was a star much beloved by my parents). By its re-release in the 70s, I knew a little about most of the others - Berle, Rooney, Caesar, Falk - but I knew most about Merman. And it's a primary reason for my love of this movie that it captures Merman in all her glory - and it's the only movie that does, notwithstanding THERE'S NO BUSINESS LIKE SHOW BUSINESS and CALL ME MADAM. MAD WORLD gives Merman the cinematic space she needed for that gigantic theatrical energy.Another element I appreciate now is the juxtaposition of all these wonderful performers. Terry-Thomas and Milton Berle are such an unlikely double-act, but their scenes together are superb, especially their extremely funny patriotic row that precedes their equally funny fight. And then there's the pairing of Jonathan Winters and Phil Silvers - both completely different, both wonderful. Hackett and Rooney are a bit less successful, I think, because Rooney works too hard, but Hackett himself makes up for it.

Dazed and Confused is for the survivors of the 1970s that group of Americans who came of age when bellbottoms, love beads, mantras, and marijuana were the fashion, drinking and driving hadn't become taboo, and safe sex was used only to avoid pregnancy or VD. As the United States reached her bicentennial, Vietnam was over -- if the memories still lingered -- and the short-lived disco craze was building to a frenzy that Saturday Night Fever would both exploit and exacerbate.This movie begins on the last day of the 1975-76 school year, and finishes less than twenty-four hours later. For Randy Pink Floyd (Jason London) and his friends, it's the end of their tenure as high school juniors, and with the final bell of the last period, they have reached the ultimate goal for teenagers -- they are seniors. At the local junior high school, Mitch Kramer (Wiley Wiggins) and his cohorts have a serious problem to consider. They are members of the incoming freshman class and, as part of a time-honored tradition, they are about to be totally and painfully humiliated by the new seniors.Dazed and Confused explores the beginning of the 1976 summer from the varying perspectives of an unusual group of characters. Just about every type is represented the timid nerd looking for a way to break out of his shell, the mindless jock, the overaged twentysomething guy who likes hanging out with teenagers, the blond bombshell, the stoned-out-of-his mind pot addict, and the timid newcomer. Writer\/director Richard Linklater (Slackers) is only partially successful in his attempts to avoid making his characters into caricatures. Most of what works with the youthful population of Dazed and Confused is due more to the performances of a fine cast than the writing.There isn't much to this picture. The storyline is minimal and the characters' personalities are as hazy as the marijuana-drenched atmosphere. What Linklater does exceptionally well is open the door on an era seventeen years in the past. This is 1976, from the music and cars (which combined cost a huge chunk of the $6 million budget), to the people and their attitudes. You'd have to climb into a time machine to get a better view.Comparisons with American Graffiti are warranted, remembering, of course, that this is the next generation. Both have similar aims, but while Graffiti's plot may have been no less insignificant than that of Dazed and Confused, its characters are better defined. At times, Linklater seems too wrapped up in getting everything right about the time period. While the directors of both films care about their protagonists, George Lucas does a better job of transferring that feeling to the audience.The cast is one of new or barely-recognizable names and face (Michelle Burke, who went on to do Coneheads, is among the few who might tweak the memory). None of the principals can have a clear memory of 1976 (unless they're a lot older than they look), yet they play their roles like they lived through it. Most memorable of all is Wiley Wiggins' Mitch, who performs almost every scene (including one where he buys his first six-pack) with an affecting blend of charm and realism.Dazed and Confused is irresponsible and politically incorrect, and almost worth applauding on those grounds alone. Overall, however, this is light entertainment -- nothing groundbreaking or even especially noteworthy. This film was made to celebrate a dead culture, and those who were part of it, or are merely curious, will find a path into the past through it.

Yes he over-acts, but he does it in a fun way that doesn't take me out of my suspension of disbelief, but it does perfectly sell the moment. You know how when a friend is retelling a funny story, and you want them to retell it perfectly, but it never quite lives up to expectations? With Jim Carrey he totally delivers every time because he is either that talented, and\/or he works it until it is perfect and then lets the director count it on film.The Cable guy is better every time you watch it. Almost all of my friends and family didn't like it the first time they saw it, yet almost without exception they all love it now. I had to push them at first, and kind of hand-fed them some of the jokes, and the subtle nuances in the scenes, but eventually they all started to appreciate it throughout the movie. We were all impressed with the writer, Lou Holtz Jr, whom we are all enthusiastically waiting for another script leading to another movie. He really gave the film Team a wonderful foundation with which to perform.I think the reason it is my favorite is because of its disguise. At first it was supposed to be a mega commercial hit, and had all the trappings of one. And then it was a big commercial and critic-review letdown because they let Jim go too nuts, and because it was too dark. But the few of us that could see that it was not a superficial commercial hit, and saw the tremendous work that went into the script, into every scene, and the characters, and then to be totally irreverent and paradoxical to the extreme. It is a dark comedy, not a disturbing comedy, that if taken too seriously shows a troubled guy ruining many peoples lives. It's just a comedy that doesn't hold back anything, and actually goes after everything that is, or could be, taboo. And it is my favorite Carrey movie simply because it is kind of a hidden jewel that keeps being funny over and over again, and often reveals more reasons to laugh with each new viewing.Some of my favorite scenes, that I don't hear many people talking about are the following 1.) At the beginning, when Chip just met Steven and as the cable guy is looking for the location of the old cable connection behind Steven's apartment wall. He treats the pursuit for the old cable like a pursuit of a female conquest and talks like a guy with a lisp who thinks he's a ladies man romancing a wanting woman. Tell me how you like it... and Here's the sweet spot as he circles the wall with his fore finger and with the camera head on, lays is face on its side flat against the wall. And then, as usual in this movie, the scene climax comes with full power as he quickly pulls out his drill and deftly puts his big drill bit in the drill and quickly and powerfully powers up the drill and thrusts it into the wall, while at the same time moans his words to Steven as he thrusts the drill. And the words to Steven are creepy because he knows that Steven had a recent breakup with his girlfriend and as he is thrusting he is saying Steven's ex-girlfriend's name. It's almost like Chip is thrusting into Steven's girlfriend as he is drilling the wall for the new cable. It was perfectly synchronized and delivered.But it's not over, the scene still could be better (not because I needed it to be better, but because these guys who wrote and made the movie really knew how to make it better and took the time to do it right). The climax hit when Steven took offense to Chip's unwelcome intrusion into his personal life, and declined when Chip backed off which was the anti-climax moment, and as the tension started to release and the camera pulled away, you could see Steven (Mathew Broderick) discretely pull his robe to cover up a bit more, if as to say that he was a little worried about this guy's advances, again playing off Chip using the cable installation as an allegory of an aggressive romantic conquest and Steven being somewhat as an unsure potential sexual victim having witnessed the unwelcome yet totally masterful advances of Chip.2.) The morning after the Karaoke party, breakfast with scramby eggs 3.) Living Bert Reynolds character in Sharky's Machine at the restaurant when Steven's ex-girlfriend is on a first date with Owen Wilson, and Chip is trying (and succeeding of course) to mess things up for Owen.Sorry, I want to explain why I liked the second and third example, but no time left!

Ballard, nor do I want to read it, after watching the debacle that is this film. When people tell you to read the novel the movie is based on, then the film has failed in telling you the whole story.I will now attempt to explain the plot of this film we first start with a woman (played very blandly by Deborah Kara Unger) having sex with a man in an airport hanger. Then we see her husband (played by James Spader) having sex with his secretary.

As the movie opens Dedee is running away from a dysfunctional relationship with her mother in Louisiana to surprise her half-brother Bill (Martin Donovan) in Indiana. Dedee's narration is not quite like any we have seen - she comments on what's happening and what's going to happen. For example, she says right off that, I don't have a heart of gold and I don't grow one later, and she lives up to that. When we see a gun in the foreground she tells us to pay close attention to that, it will play a role later. And so on. Bill, a high-school teacher, is gay and has recently taken up with a new partner (Ivan Sergei) after his previous lover has died of AIDS. Complications come fast and furious as Bill tries to deal with Dedee and with being (falsely) accused of molesting one of his male students. What brings this movie to life is its mordant repartee - it's up to the standards of the old Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn comedies, but with dark and sometimes politically incorrect humor. Things lose steam toward the end with more conventional resolutions than we expect or hope for, but the story holds up pretty well.This is not entirely a comedy as it deals with topics like how easy it is for a teacher's career to be ruined just by his having been accused of a sexual misadventure. The vagaries of love and sex are lampooned, but are not trivialized. Some original takes are given on these subjects (if that is still possible) like when Carl (Lyle Lovett) speculates that maybe sex isn't for recreation or procreation, but for concentration.Donovan plays the earnest and thoughtful Bill with a presence that commands attention; Bill is similar to Donovan's character in the more serious Hollow Reed. As the sister of Bill's ex-lover, Lisa Kudow shows a great sense of comedic timing. The entire cast is hitting on all cylinders, given that Lyle Lovett perhaps does not have as many cylinders to hit on as the others.If you like black humor and are not offended by a movie that deserves its R rating for explicit sexual language and situations, I think you will like this.

Well, the whole thing ... even assuming you could transplant faces, how can anyone possibly believe that someone with a completely different physique and mannerisms could fool even work colleagues, let alone a wife or a brother? How can we believe that Travolta would go into such a thing with only a couple of people knowing what he's done? Why did they leave Cage alive, and how on earth did he magically go from brain-dead to fully conscious at exactly the critical moment? How could Travolta-as-Cage almost effortlessly manage to break out of a maximum-security prison without even any advance planning? I could go on but I don't think I'll bother - I don't think the writers did.The near-constant violence is also pretty unpleasant if you bother to think about it. It's common in this kind of action film for bystanders to die in great numbers without anyone apparently caring much, but this goes further than most because Travolta, supposedly on the side of law and order, manages to be responsible for the deaths of quite a few people on his own side, as well as the bad guys (it was slightly unclear in all the shooting whether he actually killed any himself or not).

I wish Ike had a few scenes in the movie, but other than that Patton is one of the great flicks in history. I just wish General Patton had been alive to see it.

That is to bring to life the books as never before seen and as readers always imagined them to be. Under the direction of Peter Jackson and with the help of a fantastic cast, The Fellowship of the Ring is one of the best films of 2001 and one of the most visually stunning films I have ever seen.For those that have not read the books, the story focus' around the discovery of the One Ring and how a fellowship is formed to destroy it. The One Ring, if in the hands of the dark entity Sauron, could overthrow the world of Middle-Earth. A group of nine is formed of hobbits, a wizard, two men, a dwarf, and an elf. The journey they will have and the dangers they will face are near incredible.Now from reading the plot line and kinds of characters presented many would think this film was made for children and is real corny. it is anything but corny and hardly a children's movie. First off, the battle scenes are amazing. The filming and direction used in the scenes are spectacular where most can watch with the presence of little blood but still not be disappointed with the action presented.What is done exceptionally well is how easy the story is able to be understood and followed. With that being said, Tolkein's story is barely changed and what is left out are only the parts that have nothing to do with the story. The story is truly brought to life. The casting was the most important part. If actors such as Brad Pitt and Matt Damon were portraying the characters of Aragorn and Legolas then the film would have failed mostly by their popularity. The film takes many relatively unknown actors, as Star Wars did, and lets them be the stars. This works to the audiences advantage by not knowing the actors you are able to focus more on the story and not on the actor portraying the characters.The visuals are incredible. The sets used, and yes sets not CGI stages, are believable and great care is taken to make them look as real as possible. The Shire, Rivendell, and Lothlorien are breathtaking. What visual effects that are used are few and far between and don't take anything away from the story. The effects aren't over done or used.The Lord of the Rings THe Fellowship of the Ring is visually stunning, it is well acted, and is directed by the next great director of our time.

None of the prequels can compare to this gem, arguably the weakest of the original Star Wars movies. The plot's okay the heroes rescue Han Solo from the evil Jabba the Hutt, then go on to destroy the Death Star's deflector shield on the wooded planet of Endor, simultaneous with an attack on the Imperial ships orbiting the planet. Luke Skywalker must confront his father, attempting to bring him back to the Light Side while also dealing with the Evil Emperor, who covets young Skywalker's power and wants to train him to be a Sith Lord, like his father. All in all, the movie ties up loose ends nicely, although any viewers may think the heroes have incredible advantages that couldn't possibly work. Lighten up, it's a science fiction fantasy adventure! Good wins, case closed.I enjoyed the sets, filming locations, and characters much more than the story. One of my favorite scenes is when the heroes are in Jabba the Hutt's castle, surrounded by an odd assortment of life forms and monsters. Jabba himself has become an indelible science fiction icon, though not as much as Darth Vader. I personally loved the PUPPETS and stop motion effects MUCH, MUCH more than the computer generated imagery in the prequels. The monster Luke has to face in Jabba's pit is beautifully ugly, and is a stop motion masterpiece worthy of Ray Harryhausen's accolades (this creature---or something very similar to it---would be reincarnated as a threat to Beldar in Coneheads). I also liked the much hated Ewoks. Yes, they're cuddly teddy bears, yuk! But I liked George Lucas's attempts to bring primitive hunter-gatherer cultures into the sci-fi mix and include them as heroes. The sets were fantastic, like Jabba's creepy castle and the Ewok village high in the trees. Lucas chose lovely settings for this movie, from the sand dunes east of California's Imperial Valley and Anza Borrego Desert, to the redwood forests of northern California. It's a way of translating our real world into that of fantasy.Oh yes, the guys will watch for Princess Leia in that metal bikini while she's a captive of Jabba.

As was the case with Rob Roy, Jesse James, and Bonnie and Clyde, popular culture once again whitewashes the acts of a real-life criminal and reinvents them as a folk hero. Set in Sicily during the 1940s, the film begins with Giuliano (Christopher Lambert) and his friend Pisciotta (John Turturro) stealing grain to feed hungry villagers. Caught in the act, Giuliano escapes after shooting a police officer, but he is seriously wounded himself (despite his life-threatening injury, Giuliano still manages to outrace the authorities and leap onto the back of a horse!). Giuliano seeks shelter in a monastery and is treated by a barber who says he will certainly die. However, Giuliano declares that he will live and makes a miraculous recovery. Giuliano's (near) death and resurrection is obviously intended as an allusion to Christ. I'm not a religious person, but I still think there's something blasphemous about comparing a thief and murderer to the Messiah.Once fully healed, Giuliano launches a crusade to provide the poor people of Sicily with land and counter the authority of the Mafia, the Catholic Church, and the wealthy landowners. To accomplish this he becomes a bandit and flees to the mountains, eventually assembling a large following. However, Giuliano goes too far, makes powerful enemies, and (in another parallel with Christ) is betrayed by a Judas in his ranks.If executed properly, The Sicilian could have been a powerful, complex tale of a man who does terrible things for noble reasons and ends up undermining everything he fought for. Unfortunately, the motion picture is plagued by poor choices. Various accents are spoken by the international cast, very few of which sound remotely Sicilian. Christopher Lambert in particular is miscast. Supporting characters come and go without contributing much to the story. Numerous factions become involved in the plot - the government, the Mafia, the church, the nobility, and the socialists - but it's not always clear whom is allied with whom or why. Many scenes were cut from the finished film by the studio and the audience can tell.The Sicilian was directed by Michael Cimino, who has a very mixed track record. After directing one of the greatest movies of all time, The Deer Hunter, Cimino was responsible for the notorious commercial and critical disaster Heaven's Gate (which, in retrospect, is actually not that bad).

With the repertoire of many WONDERFULLY acted films to his credit, he absolutely RADIATES class and sex-appeal in this movie as Nickie Ferrante. You are immediately taken aback by his cheekiness and smug exterior--just to be reeled in by his wit and his little boy-like innocence. It's as if he's been a naughty child who needs reprimanding--and he knows it. His playboy charm, his charisma, his classic look and gentleman-ly qualities EXUDE perfection! Even his trademarked unusually-cadenced and accented voice is tops! He is also a complete stitch--with his spot-on humor, his comedic timing can't be beat! His interaction(s) with Deborah Kerr are so poignant and wonderful, you just WISH you could be the proverbial fly on the wall while they work off each other. (EX The dining room scene--oh how you can feel the stares!) Deborah Kerr is absolutely EXQUISITE as Terry McKay! You feel her jubilation at her meeting Nickie, her deep respect and adoration for Nickie's Grandmother, her great indecisiveness once the ship comes to port, her great yearning to live her life on her own, and her utter heartbreak as she has to say goodbye-again (Or does she?) And their first KISS! OH! It just further proves that skin is DOES NOT HAVE TO BE in when you have such a wonderful plot, dialogue, characters, scenery and TRUE ACTING! NO fillers of lewd love scenes, explosions, death, or awful obscenity-laced dialogue are necessary (if it's in the first 10 minutes, you're gonna be wasting the next 2 HOURS!)--this film is TRULY a work of art! This film makes you wish you were alive back then, just so you could've experienced all of the people, places and feelings that they--the characters so BRILLIANTLY show you--like when they used to paint billboards, when department stores had people who ACTUALLY helped you (and knew what they were selling), when women wore hats and gloves EVERYWHERE--don't forget the handkerchief, when going to the theater meant furs and jewels and tuxes with boutonnières, when letters were written on paper and when a man would rather DIE than betray the word he gave a woman--even if it meant his own unyielding unhappiness. OH HOW I LOVE THIS MOVIE! The transitional phases that the characters go through are so moving that you can't help but laugh, cry, bristle in anger and root for the couple you just KNOW are gonna make it! (They just HAVE to!) As many times as I've seen this film, I still cry at the end--the look on Cary Grant's face when he sees--for once--what had been right in front of him, all along. You're just saying to yourself, NOW'S THE TIME NICKIE! GO FOR IT! (HANKIE ALERT!) It, yet again, proves that a look is worth a million clever words--and that Cary Grant is an EXCEPTIONAL dramatic actor! Many movies have tried and failed to completely encompass the pure magic of this film--and for good reason. Even the biggest tough guy you know will turn to you and say--It was alright when they see this film! My favorite line in this film is at the end--I wouldn't DREAM of spoiling it for you--but when you hear it (if you're not uncontrollably sobbing) you'll see why!

It, yet again, proves that a look is worth a million clever words--and that Cary Grant is an EXCEPTIONAL dramatic actor! Many movies have tried and failed to completely encompass the pure magic of this film--and for good reason. Even the biggest tough guy you know will turn to you and say--It was alright when they see this film! My favorite line in this film is at the end--I wouldn't DREAM of spoiling it for you--but when you hear it (if you're not uncontrollably sobbing) you'll see why! It's an absolute MUST see--don't deprive yourself of one of the most beautiful films of ALL time--you won't regret it!

There-to me-will NEVER be another so classically and stunningly acted film as this! This movie was SO wonderful, SO romantic, SO breathtaking--it's a movie that all movies could TRY to be, but they would blessedly fall short! Cary Grant is my all-time FAVORITE male lead! With the repertoire of many WONDERFULLY acted films to his credit, he absolutely RADIATES class and sex-appeal in this movie as Nickie Ferrante. You are immediately taken aback by his cheekiness and smug exterior--just to be reeled in by his wit and his little boy-like innocence. It's as if he's been a naughty child who needs reprimanding--and he knows it. His playboy charm, his charisma, his classic look and gentleman-ly qualities EXUDE perfection! Even his trademarked unusually-cadenced and accented voice is tops! He is also a complete stitch--with his spot-on humor, his comedic timing can't be beat! His interaction(s) with Deborah Kerr are so poignant and wonderful, you just WISH you could be the proverbial fly on the wall while they work off each other. (EX The dining room scene--oh how you can feel the stares!) Deborah Kerr is absolutely EXQUISITE as Terry McKay! You feel her jubilation at her meeting Nickie, her deep respect and adoration for Nickie's Grandmother, her great indecisiveness once the ship comes to port, her great yearning to live her life on her own, and her utter heartbreak as she has to say goodbye-again (Or does she?) And their first KISS! OH! It just further proves that skin is DOES NOT HAVE TO BE in when you have such a wonderful plot, dialogue, characters, scenery and TRUE ACTING! NO fillers of lewd love scenes, explosions, death, or awful obscenity-laced dialogue are necessary (if it's in the first 10 minutes, you're gonna be wasting the next 2 HOURS!)--this film is TRULY a work of art! This film makes you wish you were alive back then, just so you could've experienced all of the people, places and feelings that they--the characters so BRILLIANTLY show you--like when they used to paint billboards, when department stores had people who ACTUALLY helped you (and knew what they were selling), when women wore hats and gloves EVERYWHERE--don't forget the handkerchief, when going to the theater meant furs and jewels and tuxes with boutonnières, when letters were written on paper and when a man would rather DIE than betray the word he gave a woman--even if it meant his own unyielding unhappiness. OH HOW I LOVE THIS MOVIE! The transitional phases that the characters go through are so moving that you can't help but laugh, cry, bristle in anger and root for the couple you just KNOW are gonna make it! (They just HAVE to!)

So when i was browsing blockbuster like I do a lot it caught my eye. I looked at it for a second the cover. And knew it was beat Takeshi and Omar Epps. I'm an Omar Epps fan so what could i say i couldn't pass this up. The first thing you'll notice in this movie is the sideways angles and his unique directing style. After a confrontation with Omar Epps character you find out how cool Beat Takeshi is he hardly says a word for the first 15 minutes. He portrays the essence of cool in his character. Once the movie really gets started it never stops. It takes you through the whole span of Beats attempt on L.A. First taking out the Mexican gangs then moving up. Until eventually his fall in the form of the Italian mob. THe movie isn't pretty the violence is often over the top. But Beat Takeshi does it in almost a comical way reminiscent of the Qeuntin Tarrantino movies. In the beginning of the movie you get to see Beat in his Yakuza gang in Tokyo and you get some insight on what it is like for those gangsters. Very different from the mobs and mafias of America. Beat is in my opinion the best gangster ever portrayed on cinema to date he doesn't talk that much only acts and you don't wanna get him mad. Omar Epps was a hidden surprise for me being in such a big role co staring next to Beat Takeshi. He holds his own as the Bosses Right hand man and they become close friends after a witty scene involving Omars character betting on dice with Beat and losing money then later Epps finds out there was a hole in the cup. The supporting cast is OK at what they do mostly to die and kill and for some very funny moments. Such as when one of the Hench men is playing basketball with his peers and he yelling for them to pass him the ball and he gets quickly infuriated and starts kicking the others to pas to him. The end is really something to me. Its very differently yet the same to the American gangster movies such as Scarface but does it in an off beat way. I recommend this movie to anybody who likes action or gangster movies or who wants a taste of the Japanese culture. Its one of my favorite movies by Takeshi definitely check this one out.
