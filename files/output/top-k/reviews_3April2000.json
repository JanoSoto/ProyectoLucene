Having read the book almost 6 months before watching the film, I had some idea of what to expect. Winona Ryder was already my fave actress a long time before this movie but watching this has only made me respect and admire her work even more. The film starts off great - with Winonas voice doing the narrative bit and her words really hit home. I myself have suffered from mental problems and so I could really relate to what she was saying. It is a little frustrating at times - I didnt like the way it kept showing you flashbacks and at times it got a bit confusing, but that only added to the overall feeling of the film. Clea Duvall is amazing as pathological liar Georgina, Brittany Murphy sensational as the chicken loving Daisy and Elizabeth Murphy wonderful as the little girl in so much distress that she set herself on fire. Even the small roles of MG and janet are played amazingly. However it is of course Winona and Angelina who steal the show as mad bad sociopath Lisa and vulnerable nervous little susanna. Angelina is truly fantastic and does indeed deserve all the recognition she is getting for her role. I was soooo pleased to see her win the oscar and she is an amazing actress and steals the show in every film I have ever seen her in, but I cant help but think that she has kind of stolen Winonas thunder slightly. The film is, primarily about Sussann - Winonas character and Winona does a great job. Her role does not have the edge that Angelinas has, but Winona plays her role just perfectly. Her facial expressions tell you so much - you know what shes thinking before shes even said it because of them and the bit where she has a go at Whoopis character was fantastic!!! I read where Winona has said that if you dont like her then you wont like the film , because most of the time the camera is just on her face, and I agree with that. I think anyone who doesnt like this film doesnt like Winona and thats the only reason why they dont like the film. It has some fantastic bits - my fave being where susanna and lisa sing Downtown to Polly - it was so sweet! and near the end when Sussanna paints Lisas finger nails. My only complaint is that there were bits in the film that were differant to the book and some bits in the film you wouldnt really understand unless you read the book. So for anyone who hasnt read the book - I would do so immediately. Of course although all the actresses were amazing and gave the perfomances of their lives there is one person whom people seem to be forgetting about completely - SUSSANNA KAYSEN. That woman is so emensly brave to have wrote her story and let it be made into a film for the world to see. Thanks to Sussanna Kaysen people are finally accepting mental illness for what it is - an illness and thanks to Winona this film got made because if she hadnt pushed for it to have been made it would never have happened. All the actresses in the film are going to go on to great things I know and I hope that Winona will continue to make such wonderful movies. Just one last thing .......Why on earth did she not get nominated as best actress for her role? A crime has most surely been committed there. Anyway along with SET IT OFF - this has to be my fave movie of all times. After all I am going to see it again tomorrow for the 5th time!!!!!

And even today, more than ten years after the film's release, people are still coming to that small town in NE Iowa and driving out to see the Field, to touch the bases, and to warily peek into the cornfields in center field.This movie is a must-see for anyone, male or female, who considers themselves a baseball fan.

This cardboard cut-out flick is your typical long, drawn-out game of cat and mouse that culminates with a twisted, implausible motive to an overexaggerated psychopath who has taken way too many pains to leave way to many hints which the experts have figured out way too easy.I have always been a big fan of Denzel Washington. From Glory to Malcom X and especially Devil in a Blue Dress he has never ceased to impress me. He does have some moments as this know-it-all parapalegic, and I understand that the fellow can only move his index finger, but for the most part his character of Lincoln Rhyme lacks depth and interest. Angelina Jolie on the other hand is brilliant as usual. The now-Oscar winner is perfect as the hard-boiled rookie who is (in yet another gross stretch of verisimilitude) picked by Rhyme to work the crime scenes. Queen Latifah is surprisingly tolerable. And why the hell Ed O'Neil was cast is beyond me. He was funny as Al Bundy, but he is so pathetic as an detective that there wasn't even a smile on my face. And you thought he could get no lower than a shoe salesman.The thing that did impress me was the forensics aspect. Having taken two classes in investigation, I noticed how technical the knowledge was in this movie. Most of this comes from the Jeffrey Deaver book from which it is adapted, but Jeremy Iacone also had to know a good bit to script this. Still, when Jolie's character (Amelia Donaghy) moves one of the clues, then sits it back down and photographs it, I had to cringe. I think the French would call that tainted a la O.J.. Ouch. Still, as technically correct as this film was, it was equally improbable.Deaver's book of the same title was lackluster at best, yet far better than the movie. Yet another of Iacone's intolerable offenses were his changes in the plot. For starters, there was no heat in the book between Officer Donaghy and Rhyme. But I suppose your typical Hollywood screenwriter knows that there has to be some sort of sparks flying for the masses to keep interested (as if the grisly images of tortured bodies weren't enough). On top of that,(and this is a spoiler for the movie and the book, so if you have not seen it, skip to the next paragraph) though Iacone decided to add Rhyme's mentioning a desire for euthanasia, he ends the movie with a horridly sappy Yuletide reunion with Rhyme and his estranged sister. However, Deaver ends on a much darker note, leading the reader to believe that Rhyme went through with his plans. A much more credible ending, but we all know how Hollywood has to have that feel-good uplifting BS at the end.With a twisted plot, a less-than-terrifying villain, and one bloody disgusting image after another, this movie is your average run-of-the-mill serial killer flick. Silence of the Lambs and Seven were both brilliant, but I've seen them. Why not scrap this equation for movies and plug in some different numbers. Why? Because serial killers sell, and the average moviegoer is not bright enough to figure out he is watching the same movie with a different cast. Though it is almost worth the watch just to see Jolie's tough chick performance, I would recommend those serious movie fans pass this one up.My verdict Make it a dust collector on the rental shelves.

It starts out being about Frankie Paige, a hairstylist who is suddenly afflicted with the marks of the stigmata (wounds of Christ) even though she's an atheist.  It ends up being about the Lost Gospel of Jesus.  Poor Frankie's problems start after she gets a rosary in the mail from her mom.  The rosary was stolen from a dead priest, so within the first ten minutes of the movie you know that the rosary and therefore the dead priest has something to do with her getting the stigmata.  This is called, giving the plot away, and if you have half a brain you could predict what happens in this movie from there.After this we see poor Frankie undergo all sorts of horrors as, one by one, she gains the wounds of Christ, and of course there's blood everywhere, and lots of whining about Why me.  Then comes Gabriel Byrne as a skeptical priest, and of course he's won over by her story and by her.  The movie did not deal well with the relationship between Father Andrew.  They fudged it by having a long dreamlike sequence where they sit and have coffee and talk while music plays and the camera cuts back and forth between them.  This is supposed to imply that they talked for hours and got to know and like each other, but in reality it simply implies that their conversation was too tremendously boring to bear, and immediately after that conversation she gets the nails through her feet anyway, to keep your interest. The rest of the movie is a hodgepodge of The Exorcist, The Omen, and excerpts\/misreadings of the Gospel of Thomas (which, by the way, is a real book).  The special effects are decent, and both Arquette and Byrne do their best to bring humanity to an otherwise lifeless script.  Jonathan Pryce's villainous Cardinal is totally predictable and one of the most inept performances I have ever seen from him.  At the end of the movie, after they have spent so much time on Frankie and made us care about her, she just wanders off, wearing a bedsheet.  I swear, that's actually how they get rid of her character; she gets un-possessed, and she just wanders off looking at her wrists wondering where her wounds went.  This is heinously bad writing.  The movie spends a lot of time getting you to care about Frankie, and then she just...wanders...off?  Did she go back and become a hairdresser? Did she keep in touch with excommunicated Father Andrew and go out with him?  Did she become a homeless person? Did she drop down a manhole? ANYTHING would have been preferable to just having her wander off into the foggy mist outside the rectory.  It's just plain BAD WRITING.  It shows contempt for the audience and for the characters, and poor Patricia Arquette, who really puts a lot into this character and in the end gets nothing out of it.  This movie is basically a complete failure; it builds up and builds up, and then the payoff is not only miniscule, but extremely unsatisfactory.  It's not unresolved in an arty way, the movie is unresolved in a way that screams BAD SCRIPT!  In short this is a waste of time except for the special effects. If you're into watching Patricia Arquette thrash around and bleed a lot, and I hope you're not, you might want to watch this movie.  Otherwise, don't even bother.

Simply put, High Fidelity doesn't insult the audience.  In a way, High Fidelity is an anti-movie movie.  Its positive qualities can best be explained by discussing what its NOT.Instead of shouting movie cliches at each other, the characters have conversations that feel real.  Characters in the film speak with inflection and phrasing that people actually use in real life.  When was the last time you found yourself involved in a case of mistaken identity?  How about a run in with a pesky dog?  An elaborate slapstick bout with the meal you're cooking?  These things only happen in movies and they don't happen in this movie.  The film is not built around funny scenes, rather great characters. The plot isn't moved forward by awkward plot points (Act 1 I know CPR!; Act 3 Now I can use my CPR!).  One could complain that the film feels long and boring, but that might be because we're more used to movies about crap blowing up than character-driven plots.  There are tons of obscure music references in the movie.  I didn't get them all and, more importantly, the movie didn't feel it had to bend over backwards to explain the references to me.Further, any single one of the characters in High Fidelity can easily support his or her own film.  We might only see them for a few minutes of screen time, but one gets the feeling that there is so much more about these characters than the movie is letting on.  It's nice to encounter the rare movie where we only get a seeming slight glimpse into the lives of the characters--that when a scenes ends the characters continue to live fully developed, multi-faceted lives without our having to directly witness it. For example, Joan Cusack has, at most, eight minutes of screen time.  Yet we have a complete understanding of who her character is.  Tim Robbins even has less screen time and we know him better than we'll ever know his character in Mission to Mars.The movie also manages to overcome two movie no-nos it's an adaptation of a cult hit novel and the main character constantly breaks the fourth wall and talks to the audience.Dealing with the first, its remarkable how faithful the movie is to the Nick Hornby book.  Having fond memories of the novel, I did not leave the theater complaining that the movie left out this or the movie changed that.  If you liked the book, see the movie.  If you liked the movie, read the book.The second point, John Cusack addressing the audience isn't at all irritating, as one would expect it to be.  On Malcolm in the Middle I tire of Malcolm's asides after about fifteen seconds.  In High Fidelity, Cusack spends half the movie talking to us and it works.  Maybe it's because John Cusack's likeable; maybe it's because we can relate the reality of what he's saying.High Fidelity leans towards the male side of the relationship game, but regardless of one gender, the viewer can find characters and situations that can be related to one's real life.  Highly recommended for viewing and reviewing.

Unlike a lot of Oscar winners in recent memory, this movie actually deserved every Oscar it won. It is a riveting portrait of American life in the suburbs. Probably there are few families quite as dysfunctional as this one but I bet almost all families can relate in a small way to the Burnhams.Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening play the Burnhams, a middle aged couple who are going through their mid-life crises. Spacey is working for a magazine trying to sell advertising spots and Bening is a somewhat successful real estate agent. They are stuck in a loveless marriage and while Spacey's mid-life crisis revolves mostly around his physical appearance and sexual prowess, Bening is hungry for success and feels that she is a failure. They also have a teenage daughter who thinks her parents are crazy and has basically withdrawn from any type of relationship with them.There are so many things happenning in this film that it would be hard to explore all of them at once. Spacey's character becomes infatuated with his daughter's best friend, the daughter developes a relationship with the psycho boy-next-door and Bening's character carries on a love\/hate relationship with the town's truly successful Real Estate King.What's most interesting though is that about half of the movie is way over the top while the other half is quite suttle. And it is the suttle parts that are the most interesting. The parts where you need to look closer as the tagline suggests. There are not a lot of answers here but there is a lot of food for thought and American Beauty is the kind of movie you are still thinking about days later.With that said, there is one scene in the movie that seems totally out of place. It is one of the last scenes, so I can not fully describe it but it really felt out of place in this film. The scene involves Spacey and his next door neighbor. Other parts of the film were understated and they worked really well. For example, we don't really know what is wrong with Ricky's mother but she is barely conscious and her memory is shot. We do not know whether her condition is caused by being beaten or by some sort of degenerative disease but Ricky is obviously scared of ending up the same way. So when we see the hundreds of videotapes in Ricky's room and he gives the speech about beauty and never wanting to forget, we can understand the motivation for his behavior. This final scene however clashes with the style and pacing of the movie. I was impressed by the acting, the story, the style of the movie and everything else. This movie is truly a must see. If it were not for that one little scene, this movie would be a perfect 10. As it is, I had to give it a 9\/10 although I would have given it a 9.5 or even 9.75 if the system allowed for it.

Probably there are few families quite as dysfunctional as this one but I bet almost all families can relate in a small way to the Burnhams.Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening play the Burnhams, a middle aged couple who are going through their mid-life crises. Spacey is working for a magazine trying to sell advertising spots and Bening is a somewhat successful real estate agent. They are stuck in a loveless marriage and while Spacey's mid-life crisis revolves mostly around his physical appearance and sexual prowess, Bening is hungry for success and feels that she is a failure. They also have a teenage daughter who thinks her parents are crazy and has basically withdrawn from any type of relationship with them.There are so many things happenning in this film that it would be hard to explore all of them at once. Spacey's character becomes infatuated with his daughter's best friend, the daughter developes a relationship with the psycho boy-next-door and Bening's character carries on a love\/hate relationship with the town's truly successful Real Estate King.What's most interesting though is that about half of the movie is way over the top while the other half is quite suttle. And it is the suttle parts that are the most interesting. The parts where you need to look closer as the tagline suggests. There are not a lot of answers here but there is a lot of food for thought and American Beauty is the kind of movie you are still thinking about days later.With that said, there is one scene in the movie that seems totally out of place. It is one of the last scenes, so I can not fully describe it but it really felt out of place in this film. The scene involves Spacey and his next door neighbor. Other parts of the film were understated and they worked really well. For example, we don't really know what is wrong with Ricky's mother but she is barely conscious and her memory is shot. We do not know whether her condition is caused by being beaten or by some sort of degenerative disease but Ricky is obviously scared of ending up the same way. So when we see the hundreds of videotapes in Ricky's room and he gives the speech about beauty and never wanting to forget, we can understand the motivation for his behavior. This final scene however clashes with the style and pacing of the movie. I was impressed by the acting, the story, the style of the movie and everything else. This movie is truly a must see. If it were not for that one little scene, this movie would be a perfect 10. As it is, I had to give it a 9\/10 although I would have given it a 9.5 or even 9.75 if the system allowed for it.
