[{"date":"11 December 2012","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Exhilarating thriller concerns a young punkette in Berlin named Lola (Franka Potente ,she broke up with longtime companion Tom Tykwer in spring 2002) who has twenty minutes to find and bring 100,000 Deutschmarks to her small-time criminal boyfriend before he robs a supermarket . Mani (Moritz Bleibtreu) has lost a bag of money he was delivering to his boss (Heino Ferch) and she desperately tries to save from death by helping him obtain a huge amount of money he carelessly lost. Lola has only twenty minutes to make good or Mani is history . She then sprints off in a rapid attempt to encounter money needed to save her sweetheart . Lola bets to the number twenty, the first and last story last twenty minutes and twenty minutes is also the time she has to get the money . It takes you on three diverse trips with Lola, all controlled by destination , showing you what would happen in each, and all the what if's that provide the foundations for each outcome .Frantic thriller proceeded in fast moving and excitingly narrated under various points of sight . Franca Potente is good as Lola, a young woman who receives a frenetic phone call and takes three different journeys , all controlled by fate . The screenplay comes roaring and is then repeated with various outcomes based on small changes in Lola's way with different style to match . This film contains about 1581 transitions (edits, dissolves, fades, wipes, etc) in 71 minutes of action (i.e. excluding the credits, and pre-credits sequence). This equates to an Average Shot Length of about 2.7 seconds. Interestingly, the editing is relatively slower towards the end of the film , for most contemporary films, the opposite is the norm. There are many spirals in the film (stair cases, bar behind phone booth etc) , this is because director Tom Tykwer was a fan of 'Alfred Hitchcock''s Vértigo . Colorful and glimmer cinematography by Frank Grieve who subsequently had an excellent international career , the colors red (Lola's hair, numerous cars, telephone) and yellow (the phone box, supermarket, tram) appear very often in the film, these colors were selected by the cameraman and director to signify danger , the reds are mainly in Lola's scenes and yellows in Manni's . This is Tom Tykwer's first international breakthrough and was a hit with both audiences and critics alike. Tom's energetic style helps push this exciting and brilliant thriller . The film garnered many awards and was the most successful German film of the year. Subsequent projects filmed in creative manner and technically developed by Tykwer include the followings  The princess and the warrior (2000) ,Heaven (2002), the successful The perfume (2006), The International (2009) and the ambitious epic Cloud Atlas (2012).
