Considering I am not much of a sports fan, and certainly not much of a fan of running, this is a very impressive statement for me to make.BackgroundI am a 24 year old male engineering and computer science student living in SC. I do have a large humanities background.OverviewWhat a great drama. There are several conflicts that are played out during this movie. The ones between Prefontaine and his coach, his mother, ,his friends, his opponents, his girlfriend are great. But the one between himself is the best.This movie has some great quotes in itSteve Prefontaine I don't want to win unless I know I've done my best, and the only way I know how to do that is to run out front, flat out until I have nothing left. Winning any other way is chicken-shit.Steve Prefontaine I'd like to work it out so that at the end, it's a pure guts race. If it is, I'm the only one who can win it.Steve Prefontaine I can endure more pain than anyone you've ever met. That's why I can beat anyone I've ever met.But the best one is when he is talking with his girlfriend and his say believing in anything is a miracle. He says a lot of people say they believe in something but most of them don't. He says he believes in himself and the way he runs but a lot of people don't. I actually had to stop the movie and think about this part of the movie. And after I was done watching it I though it over some more and then some before I went to sleep that night.He stands out from the crowd even when he is running. He is different and he is real. The coach has a line which he repeats in the beginning and the end which goes something like Running is an observed activity, if you can find meaning in it you can find meaning in that other observed activity - life. This quote is an important line to me in this movie. It applies to everyone in it, especially Prefontaine, and to everyone watching it. I have no doubt that Prefontaine found meaning in running and being true to himself. I also think he found meaning for a lot of people in his life by doing so.I think the message of this movie is life is about being real with the people you love. I for one agree.Be sure to check out my other reviews.Thanks.

It is easily the most over-rated film of the year. It disturbs me that so many people call this movie great. We start off fine and dandy. Tensions at the dinner table, a sexually frustrated married couple, a horribly pessimistic and self-loathing Lester... This is the best thing the movie has going. When Lester catches his first glimpse of Angela, his daughter's teenage cheerleader friend, we have one of the most beautifully done movie scenes in recent history. The momentum continues only for a short time after this. Lester eavesdrops on his daughter and her friend and overhears some tips on how to be more attractive to his young goddess. Kevin Spacey is briefly brilliant as the 42-year old obcessed with impressing this teenager by lifting weights. He takes a new outlook on life, and becomes rebellious. The tremendous discomfort at the dinner table scuffles is the last good piece of movie left in American Beauty. As Lester says during his morningly masturbation ritual in the shower, It's all down hill from here. We are less than half-way through the movie, and the focus turns to Lester's daughter, played by Thora Birch. She does not have the skill to carry any drama, let alone a struggling, lopsided one like this. A weird, poorly acted role of a drug-dealing, teenage peeping Tom character wrestles his way in and ruins everything. He and his father are such pitifully formulaic characters that it makes me sick. Are we supposed to believe that an 18-year old would actually go around recording plastic bags floating in the wind or a dead man on the side of the road because he's obcessed with beauty? So much so that it makes him feel pain? The end was a pitiful attempt at surprise. . . In my opinion, it would be much better. . The production design of this movie is great. It actually is beautiful. It is wildly funny and clever at the beginning, but strains and spins out to a dismal end. It's a half-baked script. I like the performances of Kevin Spacey, and this is one of his better ones, but I still think he has a long way to go. Because of poor writing, he turns from being the perfect Lester into an actor miscast in a strange role. Annette Benning gives the best performance out of the bunch, and deserves Oscar consideration. All of the young actors were terrible, but I can't blame them. Leaving this move will give you a weird feeling. It is definitely entertaining at times, but is for the most part half-baked. The most tell-tale sign of a poor script is the obvious plug for the legalization of marijuana. Frankly, I think the first half of this script was written sober, and finished while high. I'm glad to see a movie like this get such popularity (as opposed to a movie like Armageddon), but this just isn't the right movie. If you want a good one, go see Bringing Out the Dead. I'd give it a 7 out of 10, but for reasons that most people can't appreciate. I share the view of themes it expresses, such as 1) A fully-grown man can be happy with a fast food job, even when his wife is making a lot more money than him, and 2) Material possessions mean nothing (as it is presented through the couch scene). I give Sam Mendes credit for the effort, but the fact is, if you look closer, you'll not see the underbelly of suburbia. You'll see the underbelly of a borderline flop.

That, I think, lies at the heart of the many chants of worst movie ever made from BWP's detractors. It's also one of the reasons the film will stay in the heads of its fans for days, and why those fans won't shut up about it.The problem is that not everyone is used to art which doesn't readily explain itself, which makes the viewer work at interpreting it.  Two practitioners of this type of art in other fields are the writer William S. Burroughs and the composer John Cage.  Some famous movies which do the same kind of thing are L'Avventura, Last Year at Marienbad, 8 1\/2, and Blow-Up.  Some people can't stand these films, others can't live without them.  What they have in common with BWP is that they put the viewers' minds to work, filling in the deliberate gaps in the plot and unexplained areas. While a lot of people dote on films like this that make them think, others don't appreciate being put to work when they've come to be entertained.A better precedent for BWP is David Holzman's Diary, which purports to be a young filmmaker's attempt to turn his life into a film (and which also aroused strong negative reactions from viewers who felt cheated by its not being real).  Some have asked why the students kept filming after losing all control over events.  The answer is that, like David Holzman, they found the act of recording their experience on film was the only way to impose order and meaning upon the experience.Alfred Hitchcock, I think, said something to the effect that drama was just real life with all the dull parts removed.  BWP does have some admittedly dull parts, and its detractors have seized upon these as proof of its badness.  Others have cited the repetitive dialogue, and the arguments that run in as many circles as the students themselves.  One could also argue, though, that these devices enhance the veracity of the film (at least on an emotional level--we all know it's not real, right?).  Along with the fact that almost all the shots are point-of-view, they give the impression of actually being inside the film while it's happening.  This is another reason the film arouses so much enthusiasm.While remarkable in its own way, too much has been made of BWP's Web-driven publicity campaign.  If anything, the hype might have been too effective, in that it attracted (along with the curious film intellectuals) a number of people unsympathetic to this type of film.  On the bright side, it seems to have swept in quite a few people who, without knowing it, have been waiting all their lives to see something like this.  This is the kind of fan most likely to declare BWP their all-time favorite film, the best horror film since The Exorcist, etc.  One hopes they will get equal enjoyment out of Burroughs, Cage, and L'Avventura!For my part, I admit I don't see many regular horror films (though in retrospect I'm reminded that many landmarks of the genre, including Cat People, Psycho, Night of the Living Dead, and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre were also made on low budgets, if not micro-budgets), but do enjoy art that makes the viewer work a little.  I enjoyed BWP for all the reasons listed above, along with several images and sequences I expect to stay with me a long time.  Like a dog trying to get the last bit of meat off a bone, my mind keeps worrying at these scenes, trying to impose meaning on it all.This reminds me of how a conventionally-trained classical violinist tried out an avant-garde piece by Charles Ives and hated it, saying that if you swallowed something that disagreed with you, you could take something to get rid of it, but that he (the violinist) couldn't get these awful sounds out of his ears.  I wonder if some of the negative reactions to BWP might come from people unwillingly carrying it in their heads for days, weeks, maybe even months.BWP isn't my favorite film of all time, but I prefer it to all the other films I've seen so far this year.  I can imagine seeing better films this year, but the filmmakers are going to have to work a little to please me. (Heh, heh.)

That, I think, lies at the heart of the many chants of worst movie ever made from BWP's detractors. It's also one of the reasons the film will stay in the heads of its fans for days, and why those fans won't shut up about it.The problem is that not everyone is used to art which doesn't readily explain itself, which makes the viewer work at interpreting it.  Two practitioners of this type of art in other fields are the writer William S. Burroughs and the composer John Cage.  Some famous movies which do the same kind of thing are L'Avventura, Last Year at Marienbad, 8 1\/2, and Blow-Up.  Some people can't stand these films, others can't live without them.  What they have in common with BWP is that they put the viewers' minds to work, filling in the deliberate gaps in the plot and unexplained areas. While a lot of people dote on films like this that make them think, others don't appreciate being put to work when they've come to be entertained.A better precedent for BWP is David Holzman's Diary, which purports to be a young filmmaker's attempt to turn his life into a film (and which also aroused strong negative reactions from viewers who felt cheated by its not being real).  Some have asked why the students kept filming after losing all control over events.  The answer is that, like David Holzman, they found the act of recording their experience on film was the only way to impose order and meaning upon the experience.Alfred Hitchcock, I think, said something to the effect that drama was just real life with all the dull parts removed.  BWP does have some admittedly dull parts, and its detractors have seized upon these as proof of its badness.  Others have cited the repetitive dialogue, and the arguments that run in as many circles as the students themselves.  One could also argue, though, that these devices enhance the veracity of the film (at least on an emotional level--we all know it's not real, right?).  Along with the fact that almost all the shots are point-of-view, they give the impression of actually being inside the film while it's happening.  This is another reason the film arouses so much enthusiasm.While remarkable in its own way, too much has been made of BWP's Web-driven publicity campaign.  If anything, the hype might have been too effective, in that it attracted (along with the curious film intellectuals) a number of people unsympathetic to this type of film.

Enormous effort has already been devoted to bringing characters from the original series into the Next Generation series; Scotty, Spock, and Sarek are among the crossovers.  Although a pleasure for trekkers, this rarely results in compelling screenwriting, and Generations is no exception.The problem here, as elsewhere, is the dreaded plot device, a fantastic happening or object that allows a character to skip over decades unchanged.  In Generations, the device is an energy ribbon, which zooms through space, destroying some things, but also snatching some people into a fantasy land where dreams become reality.  In the first sequence, Kirk is one of those snatched (although others assume he is destroyed).  This allows him to meet Picard, who is snatched 80 years later by the same ribbon.So far, we're running at about the usual level of belief-suspension for a Star Trek plot, but the unlikely Kirk-Picard summit precludes even more outrageous reasoning.  First, the ribbon's fantasy land is so utterly attractive that a scientist named Soran (who had a close encounter with the ribbon years ago) willingly dispatches millions of innocent lives to arrange another, more permanent rendezvous.  Despite this, Picard and Kirk have no difficulty seeing through the facade.  It's not real, is it? Kirk asks, though if it's real enough to include all the other trappings of normal life, it should be able to replicate the feeling of realness, shouldn't it?Picard (with the help of Guinan) has no problem moving from his fantasy (a sort of Dickensian Christmas with a large family) to Kirk's (a woodsy spot where he chops wood and cooks breakfast for a slumbering lover).  Why not pop over to Soran's fantasy and talk some sense into him while he's at it?  Nevermind.  Instead, they jointly emerge from the ribbon, back into the real world, though not at the point they left it -- in fact, they're nowhere near the ribbon when they come out.  How did they manage that?  And if they're not constrained by time or space, why not pop out at some point where they can nab Soran without a struggle?  The answer, of course, is that it wouldn't make for an exciting movie, though movies with such shaky conceptual frameworks rarely excite on any but the most basic levels.Generations isn't devoid of merit.  Malcolm McDowell does a pleasantly evil turn as Soran, and Brent Spiner portrays an appropriately jangled Data, who has just installed an emotion chip.  It's fun to watch the Next Generation working with a Hollywood budget, but director Berman often falls short of the task.  More than once, he does sharp zooms on characters' faces as they are about to die violently, a technique I thought had perished in the 70s.  Still, if you're in a tight spot for a Star Trek fix, this will probably do it for you, plot device and all.

Although a pleasure for trekkers, this rarely results in compelling screenwriting, and Generations is no exception.The problem here, as elsewhere, is the dreaded plot device, a fantastic happening or object that allows a character to skip over decades unchanged.  In Generations, the device is an energy ribbon, which zooms through space, destroying some things, but also snatching some people into a fantasy land where dreams become reality.  In the first sequence, Kirk is one of those snatched (although others assume he is destroyed).  This allows him to meet Picard, who is snatched 80 years later by the same ribbon.So far, we're running at about the usual level of belief-suspension for a Star Trek plot, but the unlikely Kirk-Picard summit precludes even more outrageous reasoning.  First, the ribbon's fantasy land is so utterly attractive that a scientist named Soran (who had a close encounter with the ribbon years ago) willingly dispatches millions of innocent lives to arrange another, more permanent rendezvous.  Despite this, Picard and Kirk have no difficulty seeing through the facade.  It's not real, is it? Kirk asks, though if it's real enough to include all the other trappings of normal life, it should be able to replicate the feeling of realness, shouldn't it?Picard (with the help of Guinan) has no problem moving from his fantasy (a sort of Dickensian Christmas with a large family) to Kirk's (a woodsy spot where he chops wood and cooks breakfast for a slumbering lover).  Why not pop over to Soran's fantasy and talk some sense into him while he's at it?  Nevermind.  Instead, they jointly emerge from the ribbon, back into the real world, though not at the point they left it -- in fact, they're nowhere near the ribbon when they come out.  How did they manage that?  And if they're not constrained by time or space, why not pop out at some point where they can nab Soran without a struggle?  The answer, of course, is that it wouldn't make for an exciting movie, though movies with such shaky conceptual frameworks rarely excite on any but the most basic levels.Generations isn't devoid of merit.  Malcolm McDowell does a pleasantly evil turn as Soran, and Brent Spiner portrays an appropriately jangled Data, who has just installed an emotion chip.  It's fun to watch the Next Generation working with a Hollywood budget, but director Berman often falls short of the task.  More than once, he does sharp zooms on characters' faces as they are about to die violently, a technique I thought had perished in the 70s.  Still, if you're in a tight spot for a Star Trek fix, this will probably do it for you, plot device and all.

Then he dies and takes his secret into death What is the meaning of Rosebud? An investigating committee is quickly installed that illuminates and unwinds his life once again, like in a time-lapse film. The tragical existence of the powerful newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane becomes visible, his solitude. Although married twice, he always stayed alone, because of his incapacity of feeling love, of giving love - a love related to somebody else but himself. All women finally leave him behind on his enormous mountain palace Xanadu, on which he sits enthroned high above all human beings, so high that he finds it impossible to get anywhere near them. A distant God, resident on earth, a symbol for the inability of Man to communicate with God, for God's unrelenting distance? Maybe we can also find that. But Charles Foster Kane has got a human touch, too. His life ends in failure, despite all the accumulated power and wealth. And the key to this failure might be found in childhood, or rather the loss of childhood.For only when being a child he felt safe, somewhere in the immensity of the American North, under the loving care of his mother - probably the only person in his entire life he was ever able to show feelings for. Then he becomes rich by accident, by some happy (or must we say unhappy?) constellation of parentage. He is hurled out his familiar surroundings, taken away from the protection of the snowy landscape - the kingdom of his childhood. However much he resists and clings to his modest wooden sledge, he irretrievably has to go out into the big world, where he is raised, far away from his mother, and where he eventually builds up his empire. Of course, it is only a hollow construction and finally turns to dust. The wooden sledge, called Rosebud, is taken away by the flames like all the other goods and possessions that he has accumulated in the course of time and which he has conserved in the wide chambers of his palace souvenirs from his journeys, sculptures, vases or jewelry - things without a lasting value for posterity. Death sweeps it all away. And so, at the end of the film, you see nothing but an endless pillar of smoke, which is rising up into a darkly clouded sky, and in which everything definitely dissolves, our childhood, our memories, our entire life.

Imagination can be a one's greatest tool in this fight called life, and it comes in one form Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory.Describing how great this movie is and why would take forever. Just rest assured that if you ever hear about this movie coming on the TV or see it at a video store, that you can watch it, and then want to watch it again...and again...and again...

Yeah, him trying to find the ticket might be a somewhat tedious process, but the changing of scenes here and there keep you going, wanting to see more.  And it starts out with a great song, and a great actor, and an overall great scene.  It starts off as a masterpiece, and just when you think it might be dragging along...BOOM!  Out comes another great song\/scene.Then, the Chocolate Factory itself...Let you imagination run wild!  Surprises around every corner but nothing dangerous!.  The cast, man.  A great cast if ever one has seen one.  They all fit their part perfectly.  Violet was the least believable one, but even she was TOTALLY believable.  Get my point?  The song, the very first song sung by Willy Wonka, has to be the greatest movie song ever, and be the greatest scene ever, esp. what he does at the end of it. It's so cool, and you never expect it.  Any of it, through out the whole movie.  The monologue\/song in the boat, the umpa loompas, the many, MANY changing expressions of Willy Wonka.    Man.  Gene Wilder was so great in this movie, words cannot describe him.  Want to just forget about everything?  Forget about your worries, your doubts(were have I heard that before), your fears?

They made their debut as a scary harbinger of doom-to-come in the highly over-rated low-budget hit of all time, The Blair Witch Project earlier this summer.They play a just-as-ominous but much more subtle role in The Straight Story, David Lynch's wonderful G- rated film based on a true-life story of 73 year old Alvin Straight who drove his riding mower across two states to visit his ailing brother.The Bundle of Sticks revives its role from the over-hyped Blair Witch Project in much the same way it appeared in that film, showing up one morning outside the protagonists' tent. Here though it is a symbol of strength and one that returns a wayward girl to her family instead of taking her further away.The Straight Story is just that - quite the departure from the American master of the surreal.Shot with all the care and attention to detail we expect from Lynch, it is not without his trademark quirks. One sequence involving Alvin buying supplies for his journey features a Lynch favorite - the un-scripted buzzing fly that wanders into shot. Lynch - unlike most directors - instead of cutting the shot - leaves the fly in and even generously amps up the buzz just cause he can.But while his quirkiness defines his other films the Straight Story needs none of that heavy handedness. With the help of a few odd ball characters - watch for the double-pricing Olsen twins and the method acting of the Bundle of Sticks - Lynch has created a film that deserves at least four Oscar nominations come February. (Unless of course they develop a new category for Best Performance by an Inanimate Object which The Bundle would easily snap up.)As Alvin, played authentically by stuntman-turned-actor Richard Farnsworth, sets out on his near 6-week journey his story and the story of those he encounters unfolds with all the ease and pace of a road movie slowed to 5 miles per hour. The bread basket of America lends itself easily to picturesque setting suns, old timers milling about and combine harvesters gathering grain to create our daily bread.Lynch utilizes this natural canvas to moving effect. Alvin has his story to tell and Lynch tells it not in a spoonfed expositional way, but through little parables he delivers to those he encounters along his journey up and down the hills of Iowa. In a credit to Lynch and his team of editors and writers not one word is misplaced, not one sequence too long. (Lynch and John Roach get the writing credits.)There are moments of pure Lynch scattered throughout this heart-string-tugger that wouldn't be out of place in other Lynch visions; The long open highway and its screen dividing yellow line (Lost Highway). The sprinkler system that can't get itself to shoot higher than 6 inches while in the background a child chases his ball (the Twin Peaks TV series). And the plucky score by Angelo Badelamenti (everything good Lynch has ever directed.)But the Straight Story does something that all the other men at a crossroads films of late eschew; men can change - even old men - not by virtue of violence but by going against everyone's advice and simply taking that inertia and making a move. Even if it is at 5 miles per hour. ","genre":null},{"date":"3 November 1999","score":"","review":"  Bundles of sticks have had a good year in film.
