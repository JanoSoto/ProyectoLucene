He bathes in the mud and brushes his teeth with snail slime. The villagers try unsuccessfully to hunt him down. One day, Shrek meets a talking donkey named Donkey. Shrek took an immediate dislike to him, but Donkey tried hard to win Shrek's friendship.       Not too far away in the land of Duloc lived Lord Farquaad, a power hungry ruler. He must wed a princess to become king. But whom does he choose to be his bride? Sleeping Beauty? Snow White? Or Princess Fiona trapped in a castle guarded by a dragon? He chooses Princess Fiona, but must now find a great warrior to go and retrieve the princess from the dragon. But who will go?              Shrek finds all the fairy tale creatures camped out on his swamp and is most displeased. He learns that going to see Lord Farquaad and getting back their homes would get rid of them, so Shrek and Donkey head to Duloc. They arrive and when Shrek wins a wrestling match, Farquaad chooses him to go on the mission of saving the princess. Anything for peace and quiet, so he and Donkey set off. Along the way, Shrek explains that an ogre is like an onion, not because they smell, but because they have layers; they arrive at the castle and rescue the princess and outwit the female dragon. Fiona doesn't know her knight in shining armor is a hideous ogre.        Fiona had a deep, dark secret. Shrek and Donkey couldn't figure out what it was, but Fiona always wanted to be inside when the sun went down. Donkey soon discovers her secret she's a hideous ogre. A spell cast by a witch and it can only be broken when she get's true love's kiss and can take it's shape. Farquaad shows up and the wedding is on. Shrek and Donkey hurry to stop it on Donkey's dragon friend. Farquaad is gulped down and Shrek and Fiona live happily ever after.         This movie is OK. Not perfect, mind you. Austin Powers' Mike Myers is Shrek. The Nutty Professor's Eddie Murphy is Donkey. There's Something About Mary's Cameron Diaz is Princess Fiona and Memphis Belle's John Lithgow is Lord Farquaad. I hear there's going to be a sequel! Shrek 2, coming in two years. Chris Farley was going to be Shrek originally, but he sadly died, so the role was given to Mike Myers. So in conclusion, this movie is OK. I do recommend it.- ","genre":null},{"date":"19 September 2002","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  CONTAINS SPOILERS        Meet Shrek, a big bad-to-the-bone ogre.

He is undoubtedly insane, but it is not yet too late for him, he justs needs someone to take the effort to save him, and if it had not been for Bridges colossal mistake and subsequent search for redemption, no-one would have done it, and he would never have survived, merely another casualty of another one of Gilliams nightmarish cityscapes. Mercedes Ruehl is perfect as Bridges suffering girlfriend.She thinks of herself as hard-bitten a survivor, and yet she continues to stay with Bridges, trying to prove to herself that she has the strength to change him, to redeem him. She wants to be his saviour, and yet he comes in the shape of a homeless madman, prone to dancing naked in Central Park and seeing floating fairies whilst defecating.The Fisher King is a movie about hope, despair and redemption, and all of the human conditions that fit in between.It contains one of the most inspired,beautiful scenes in recent memory,as Grand Central station transforms from a dingy,noisy concrete hole into a luscious, gorgeous ballroom, simply because of Lydia, Parrys love, the one thing that keeps him grounded in any semblance of reality.The chinese restaurant double- date in which Parry connects with her for the first time is both funny and touching, and makes what comes after even more tragic. It is at times tragic,brutal even but it's heart cannot be doubted,and it remains a wonderful success.

That's why those men in the 54th and every other black regiment stood out from the rest.
