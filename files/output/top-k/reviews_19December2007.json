On the one hand, its the start of a whole new and exciting life. But on the other, its a terrifying prospect. Its the first time in a young person's life when they can get out into the real world and see what lies in wait for them. Either exciting surprises or grave disappointments.Ghost World, my choice for best teen film of 2001, neatly captures the mindset of anguished teenagers at this particular crossroads in life. Its not always accessible, but in this day and age of cookie cutter teen fodder, that's something of a relief.The two teens Ghost World chooses to observe are Enid and Rebecca, both wonderfully played by Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson. The opening scene witnesses their high school graduation. Something Enid & Rebecca greet with almost casual indifference. Their lives are undeniably changing, they just haven't decided if its for better or worse.Ghost World is a film that seems to occupy a bizarre buffer zone between two netherworlds. Its a skewed vision of suburbia, not unlike something out of a Tim Burton or a John Waters film. And director Terry Zwigoff paints a quite appealing portrait of an oddball utopia slowly being swallowed up by progress such as mini-marts and consumerism.Enid & Rebecca are casual observers. Anything that falls below their radar, you can bet Enid will have some witty rejoinder or dry comment dripping in sarcasm on hand, while Rebecca stands off to the side mulling it over and chipping in if and when necessary.The film charts the deterioration of their friendship. Although Enid is in no hurry to grow up and get on with things, Rebecca senses an inevitability to her life. Being a non-conformist is one thing, but at some point, we all have to conform to some of life's expectations of us.Rebecca gets a job at Starbucks (or something like it) and goes apartment hunting for herself and Enid. Things like these don't interest Enid. She's trapped in a perpetual fantasy. A bubble she believes will remain intact. And when she does try to follow Rebecca's example, doing a regular job, its like watching a dog walk on its hind legs.Enid wasn't meant for normal life. She loves to stand out from everyone around her. And she has an eclectic wardrobe for each and every (social) occasion. Rebecca may be an outsider too, but perhaps she recognises it as one of life's many phases.So with Enid & Rebecca growing further and further apart, Enid finds solace in Seymour (a perfectly cast Steve Buscemi), a record collector unlucky in love. Enid plays a rather cruel joke on Seymour by responding to a personal ad he put in the paper. She stands him up, sort of, by observing him from a distance (like she does with everything), and becomes fascinated by this oddity of a man.She senses a kindred spirit in Seymour. Someone who doesn't fit in, a social misfit, and inept at life's ironies. But when she actually gets Seymour a date, he starts spending less and less time with Enid. And as Enid's perfectly perceptive world falls apart, she spirals into depression and despair.Ghost World is the type of teen film you pray for, and when it finally comes, you almost feel like slapping yourself in astonishment. A teen film that's witty, sharp but most of all, perceptive. Also one of its nicest touches is the fact it stars actual teenagers for a change, not adults ten years older.Ghost World comes with a positively anti-authoritarian stamp on it. I sense Terry Zwigoff is a bit of a non-conformist himself. And he's selected two superb actresses to carry the film off with aplomb.Thora Birch is the undisputed star. She so neatly captures Enid's character you couldn't imagine anyone else in the role. Her performance is so wonderful the way it rotates from cynicism, intuition and eventually gut-wrenching despair. Each line of dialogue she delivers to perfection. From capital letter to full stop. And yet despite being attuned to the world around her, she is naive in her way. She has the vain belief things will always stay the same. Observing the world at a coldly detached distance. But as the world makes her a participant, its something that shatters her world forever. What an impressive, heartbreaking performance from someone so young.Ghost World came at a time just before Scarlett Johansson's career took off. And although she doesn't get as much screen time as Birch, she's equally impressive. She quite modestly allows Birch to take the spotlight because she knows its Enid's life story that's captured our interest. Johansson's performance is more subtle than Birch's, but she is necessary, because she provides an effective counterpoint to Enid's role without having to do very much at all. Which is why Scarlett Johansson is such a wonderful actress. But she'd have to wait for Lost in Translation to show her true mettle, where she plays a character not all that different from Rebecca.Steve Buscemi is in his element as Seymour. He's the man we hope to never become. Buscemi is known for choosing quirky, off-centre roles and Seymour is no exception. A man of few joys and even fewer accomplishments.The crux of Ghost World is Enid. What she slowly senses is that her defiantly defended role as life's abject observer can't go on forever. One day, she will have to grow up. And perhaps she does at the end. The last thing we ever see of her is getting on a bus. Where she's going is a mystery. But at least she's getting out of town. Perhaps progress has finally caught up with Enid.Cherish Ghost World. Its the perfect antidote to predictable teen movies and their comfortable clichés.

And as Enid's perfectly perceptive world falls apart, she spirals into depression and despair.Ghost World is the type of teen film you pray for, and when it finally comes, you almost feel like slapping yourself in astonishment. A teen film that's witty, sharp but most of all, perceptive. Also one of its nicest touches is the fact it stars actual teenagers for a change, not adults ten years older.Ghost World comes with a positively anti-authoritarian stamp on it. I sense Terry Zwigoff is a bit of a non-conformist himself. And he's selected two superb actresses to carry the film off with aplomb.Thora Birch is the undisputed star. She so neatly captures Enid's character you couldn't imagine anyone else in the role. Her performance is so wonderful the way it rotates from cynicism, intuition and eventually gut-wrenching despair. Each line of dialogue she delivers to perfection. From capital letter to full stop. And yet despite being attuned to the world around her, she is naive in her way. She has the vain belief things will always stay the same. Observing the world at a coldly detached distance. But as the world makes her a participant, its something that shatters her world forever. What an impressive, heartbreaking performance from someone so young.Ghost World came at a time just before Scarlett Johansson's career took off. And although she doesn't get as much screen time as Birch, she's equally impressive. She quite modestly allows Birch to take the spotlight because she knows its Enid's life story that's captured our interest. Johansson's performance is more subtle than Birch's, but she is necessary, because she provides an effective counterpoint to Enid's role without having to do very much at all. Which is why Scarlett Johansson is such a wonderful actress. But she'd have to wait for Lost in Translation to show her true mettle, where she plays a character not all that different from Rebecca.Steve Buscemi is in his element as Seymour. He's the man we hope to never become. Buscemi is known for choosing quirky, off-centre roles and Seymour is no exception. A man of few joys and even fewer accomplishments.The crux of Ghost World is Enid. What she slowly senses is that her defiantly defended role as life's abject observer can't go on forever. One day, she will have to grow up. And perhaps she does at the end. The last thing we ever see of her is getting on a bus. Where she's going is a mystery. But at least she's getting out of town. Perhaps progress has finally caught up with Enid.Cherish Ghost World. Its the perfect antidote to predictable teen movies and their comfortable clichés.

Knowing Hitch's wicked sense of humour, he probably would have gone along with it, but that doesn't change the fact that the film belongs to Billy Wilder, however reminiscent of a Hitchcock picture it might be. Adapted from a short story, and subsequently a play, by mystery author Agatha Christie, the film has a distinct theatrical feel to it, the story gradually unfolding mostly through dialogue, with the occasional important flashback. Just as 'Witness for the Prosecution' feels like the work of the Master of Suspense, it noticeably lacks the classy style of the actual director, with the confines of the courtroom drama perhaps unsuited to Wilder's trademark sparkling repartee though Charles Laughton certainly gets in a few masterful wise-cracks. Nevertheless, it is a genuinely thrilling and engaging mystery with an ensemble of terrific characters.Charles Laughton's Sir Wilfrid Robarts is an outrageously entertaining creation. Though having only recently recovered from a crippling heart attack, the attorney maintains a constant state of grumpiness, gruffly dismissing the well-meaning instructions of his insistent nurse, Miss Plimsoll (Laughton's wife, Elsa Lanchester). Though his health often causes him problems, and he hardly seems to be paying attention in the courtroom, Sir Wilfrid is the finest defence lawyer that the city has to offer, a shrewd and calculating legal genius, and a firm believer in the judicial process. When an agitated and seemingly-innocent young man, Leonard Steven Vole (Tyrone Power), is charged for the murder of an older lady friend (Norma Varden), our weary hero commits himself to proving the man's innocence in court, even though their chances of acquittal are seriously marred when the accused man's German wife (Marlene Dietrich) testifies against him.Much too often, time has ruined some of cinema's greatest twist-endings, and it always grieves me to have the finales of classic thrillers spoiled before I have the opportunity to watch them. In the case of 'Witness for the Prosecution,' I can happily say that I was caught completely off-guard, having not even been aware that the film contained a twist. Better yet, Agatha Christie manages, in the story's final moments, to cram in a quick succession of unexpected plot-turns, with the ending leaving us stunned and dazed, feeling as foolish and devastated as Sir Wilfrid must have been when he realised that he had just unknowingly rescued a certain murderer from punishment. Most definitely in the top five courtroom films I've ever seen, Billy Wilder's 'Witness for the Prosecution' is a different kind of classic for its legendary director, and a motion picture that, yes, I'm sure even Hitchcock would have loved.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"19 December 2007","score":"6 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" Watching Lady in a Cage made me feel really sorry for all the canary birds in this world. Imagine yourself being trapped in a too small cage, day in day out, and helplessly having to observe everything that happens around you. They could constantly live in fear for all we know. Any movie that subconsciously forces you to contemplate about such a matter has got to be at least a bit remarkable, and this Lady in a Cage is indeed one of the most perplexing (yet still sadly underrated) movies of the entire 60's decade. Olivia De Havilland portrays &#150; marvelously, I may add &#150; the wealthy poetess Cornelia Hilyard who gets trapped in her home elevator whilst her only son is out celebrating the 4th of July weekend. She desperately rings the device's emergency alarm, but this noise only lures people with bad intentions towards her house. Whilst stuck several feet above the ground, a drunken and homeless religion freak, his greedy prostitute compliance and a trio of youthful but very sadistic thugs successively invade Mrs. Hilyard's home. The concept of the film sounds very simplistic, but it's much more than just a routine and sleazy thriller. The atmosphere is enormously disturbing, the overall tone as well as the on screen brutality and depicted violence are far ahead of their time (1964, remember?) and several well-scripted sub plots and detailed character drawings make the film far more complex than it superficially appears. The perpetrators aren't your ordinary petty thieves but deeply disturbed human beings and the harrowing relationship between Mrs. Hilyard and her son (which is too unique to reveal here) actually even deserved a whole separate screenplay on its own. Director Walter Grauman also succeeds in creating a twisted & severely depressing world perspective here. Mrs. Hilyard's house lies next to a very busy road, where cars are jammed in traffic continuously and people undoubtedly hear the alarm bell, but no one bothers to check whether his\/help is required. All these aspects suggest that Lady in a Cage is a cinematic study in sociology as much as it is a claustrophobic thriller, but &#150; be advised &#150; it primarily is a strong & uncompromising chiller, and the squeamish and\/or people with a sensitive nerve system might have difficulties with it. Olivia de Havilland's performance is truly absorbing, as said, but she's definitely not the only acting highlight of the film. James Caan delivers what unquestionably has to be one of the strongest big screen debuts ever as the genuinely petrifying leader of the delinquents. Perhaps not ideal for all tastes & likings, but if you do decide to watch Lady in a Cage, it will become one of those film experiences that haunt and scare you forever.
