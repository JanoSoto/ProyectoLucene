I eventually watched it one day because I worked at the video store and could rent movies for free, and was continuing on my desperate attempt to watch every movie in the store (a goal which continues to this day, although by now I've come to realize that it's never going to happen). During my quest, by the way, I also saw the old 1970 film Airport, probably ten years after having seen parts of Airplane!, and realized that this is one of the many movies that inspired Airplane! In general, I'm a little cautious about movies that have exclamation points in the titles, but Airplane! is without a doubt one of the funniest movies ever made. Consider, for example, those little montages that studios sometimes put together and put at the beginning of movies when they come out on videotape, honoring the great movies that the studio has made in the past. They show lots of memorable clips from their old movies (and I always write all of these titles down, determined to watch them all, and then promptly lose the list that I made) to remind you how great they are. I had a good time watching Airplane! and picking out how many scenes are in the movie that can and do go into those memorable montages.Airplane! is made up of a series of hilarious scenes that string together a thin shoestring plot, which ironically speaks in the movie's defense. In general, movies with weak stories that are driven along by comedic stunts and pranks and whatnot tend to be pretty weak, but Airplane! is not driven by stunts to cover a weak story as much as the quality of the stunts and the slapstick comedy is so good that they overshadow everything else. It's interesting to watch someone like Robert Stack so many years ago and see that he looked and talked exactly like he did in Unsolved Mysteries so many years later, a show the seriousness of which boggles the mind, given that it's hosted by someone who did so well in a movie like this one.My favorite thing about this movie is, obviously, the huge amount of sound bytes that comes from it, just the cleverness of the way it was written and put together. You have the main character's `drinking problem,' the airport announcers (`Listen, Betty, don't start up with your white zone sh*t again&#133;'), the stress of the people investigating the situation on the plane (`Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit smoking\/drinking\/amphetamines.'), the plays on words (`There's a problem at the control tower!' `What is it?' `It's the big tower where the air traffic controllers talk to the planes.'), that one airport employee who was suspiciously bubbly and excited throughout the entire movie (while providing some of its best comedy), and then of course were the situational gags, such as Robert Stack pulling off his sunglasses to reveal another pair underneath (arguably the most famous scene in the entire film). This is a movie where a list like this could go on and on, and I'm sure if you go to the memorable quotes page on the IMDb you'll find a gigantic list of hilarious quotes from the movie there. It is no secret that this is something of a childish and immature comedy, but it is smartly written and has so many great scenes and bits of dialogue that it's one of those rare movies that makes you want to take notes so you won't forget a lot of the lines. It is one of the earlier versions of Leslie Nielsen's spoofs, a genre in itself which went on to tremendous success with lots of great (and some not so great) spoofs to follow.

It seemed really out of place to me and awkward. I thought that a different means of covert infiltration would have been more enjoyable. Secondly, it seems to me that the most is rushed when he boys are about to break into the mansion and in the next screen they're tied up int the chairs. I would have liked to have seen what exactly happened.Overall, the film has a great mood, great setting, entertaining characters, etc. Some of the criticisms i read bother me. Like when people have said that Il Duce was like Hannibal Lecter? give me a break. Just because a man is detained with ultra-high security doesn't mean you can compare him to a totally different type of character, Lecter, who's characterization was the fact that he was brilliant, not the fact that he was a criminal. This guy isnt brilliant, he's just a killer. Big difference.Buy the DVD; its only $10 at best buy. Hopefully the sequel will be close to as good as the original.

John Hughes has written yet another excellent story about a classical tale of teen romance. The first time I saw this movie was on t.v. at 200 in the morning. And I stayed up for every last minute of it. First of all, the cast is great. Howard Deutch pulled together some really remarkable actors and actresses for the roles of this movie.Lets start with Lea Thompson playing the popular girl, Amanda Jones. She did a fine job playing the poor girl who hangs out with all the rich kids. This role must of been really hard for her because she didn't look like a poor girl at all. I mean its Lea Thompson for christ sake! And in my opinion we have to give her alot of credit for having the guts to do this role. She came through with it and that is all that matters!Next is Craig Sheffer acting as the antagonist, Hardy Jenns. This guy did a pretty good job of acting as the rich, handsome, popular school boy who went out with Amanda Jones. In fact he did such a good job at acting his part that I wanted to punch the t.v. when I saw his face pop up on the screen. Hardy was a real a**hole!The shy kid Keith Nelson acted by Eric Stolz, definintley reminds me of myself. That is one of the reasons why this movie really inflicted a lot of trauma on me from the beginning. We are both shy, independent, nice guys. I also look alot like him too! Except I have green eyes! Kinda scary if you dont mind me saying. Anyway, Eric does a marvelous performance as the protagonist of this film. Good job man!Last but not least we have the beautifull,breathtaking,astonishing, Mary Stuart Masterson! This movie was the first time I saw her. And she took my breathe away!!!!! Playing the short blonde haired tomboy Watts, she has got some real talent. After I saw her in this movie,I knew I must see the rest of her movies she has been in. And I must say, she looks the best in this movie without a dout. Its just the fact that you can see that face of her's and see her smile. She definitley has the best smile I have ever seen in my entire life! And that is saying a lot for someone I don't even really know that well. Maybe sometime later in life I can meet her in person. I think we would do well together. No offense Damon.

No, but filmmakers generally seem to think that people of this age group (that includes me, I'm 18) have short attention spans and require flashy, MTV-style camera-work to hold our interest.

Me, I was shaking my head in disbelief at such a hilarious notion, and the way this twist is presented makes it even harder to swallow. The film sets up the dilemma that Dracula can't be killed, yet (major spoiler) the movie's finale clearly shows he can die by means of sunlight (though you have to ask yourself why doesn't just use his ability to float when he has that wire around his neck), which makes us wonder why Van Helsing didn't just expose the drained body of Dracula to the rising sun when he was still in possession of the ancient bloodsucker?The special effects are pretty cheesy, with some of the cleanest-looking decapitations I've ever seen. The CGI bats are unconvincing, and the mist that accompanies Dracula's entrance almost had me thinking I was watching a stage production. Word to filmmakers mist generally isn't scary.

V-ger is almost like a primative human being, ignorant, yet a bit intelligent and seeking answers about its existance and trying to find the creator.  It is also an evolution.  A simple first generation earth probe becomes a super powerful being.  The superior being understands its purpose far less than the simpler form.Anyway, here's my final analysis.  This movie only made it at the box office because of the decade long demand for more Star Trek.  It was actually the next move, the more action packed Wrath of Kahn, that kept interest so to speak.  This movie COULD have been the better remembered classic rather than it's successor if it hadn't tried to be so visual and have so little emphasis on development of everything else.

Great scene.Now flash forward to LA.  No Madison Square garden.  No arena even.  They go to a stadium and for some reason there is an outdoor basketball court set up?  And instead of a fight to the death, Snake is forced to take a BASKETBALL CHALLENGE?What the hell?  For the life of me, I cannot even begin to understand what the writers were thinking.  The death fight scene in Escape from NY fit so well with the movie.  And it was believable all around.

He forced his victims to participate in an NBA's All Star Saturday-style competition.  Or maybe he grew up watching the Jeep Superstars.

It looks almost exactly the same, has the same plodding narrative, lack of credible characterization, predictability, unimaginative dialogue, half-baked and poorly-realized ideas about the future, etc.  AI did have better acting for the most part.  That's a big problem here, since the movie relies almost exclusively on Cruise, who flubbs it.  Every time I see Tom Cruise on screen, he looks like he's trying too hard.  Consequently, he is rarely convincing (Born on the 4th of July being the glaring exception).  He's at his worst here, due to the effects-laden, heavy-handed direction of Spielberg.On another level, this movie completely misconstrues the essence of Phillip K. Dick, who is likely turning over in his grave right now, over and over. Dick was essentially concerned with the nature and meaning of  human-ness, with sci-fi being his story-telling vehicle.  That is where Minority Report fails large.  In spite of its massive production budget and big-name Hollywood credentials, or more likely because of it, Minority Report is utterly lacking in humanity, unoriginal and heartless, unmoving, unwatchable.  All surface and no substance.  It's below-average work by small-minded, overambitious egotists, hyped-up and overwrought to gargantuan proportions, to where it becomes an insulting, glaring failure.I can hardly believe the universality of opinion on this film; it's like everybody is parroting Roger Ebert, who continues to bestow glowing endorsements to golden turds such as this.

I thought the idea of the precogs floating in water was interesting, but it could have been so much more.  It should have been more abstract; they should have been floating in a womb-like tank, or like three witches swimming in a cauldron, with long wispy hair, instead of lying bald and partially submerged in a giant bathtub.

I am a huge fan of the Halloween series; the first one has been my favorite movie, ever since I saw it at the age of 11 and I appreciate all of the sequels on a certain level. However, this movie is just stupid. There is absolutely no point. It is the first Halloween film without a plot! After 'Halloween H20' they should have just ended it. Although I didn't think it was the best ending (or even an outstanding movie) it was a nice way to wrap up the series and end things on a high note. So many horror franchises go out on tasteless notes and end up returning again ('Jason Goes To Hell,' 'Freddy's Dead'), I was at least hoping Halloween could go out with some dignity. Except for the conclusion of the Laurie Strode character and the inclusion of Mikey, this has no connections to previous films. We follow a bunch of cliches around the Myers' house and watch as they slowly, but surely die in predictable ways. This is like something that would have been made in the 80's. It's just sub-par stalk n' slash fare. Nothing interesting or original here. The whole reality thing is about 2 years past it's expiration date. The cast is full of some big names, but they all die anyways. If you are a fan of the series, check it out, but in my opinion, they need to just put it to rest. Things are getting too complicated (We have two different ways the storyline of the series goes now) and Michael is pushing into his mid-50's. I hope Halloween 9 manages to lay this legacy to rest once and for-all. This is the only Halloween movie I don't like, and I LOVE these movies.3\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 May 2003","score":"","review":"  'Halloween Resurrection' is the one film in this series that I honestly wish was never made.

Or all three.This is one of the best movies of last year, and one of the best movies of its genre in a long, long time.  What might seem shallow on the surface to those who don't look or listen, this movie has surprising depth and layers in that you can see it multiple times (I have the DVD and have watched it through three times - plus the first time at the theater) and get something new and different out of it each time you watch.  IF you really watch and listen.  And there is great humor in this movie, in the midst of real heart-aching emotional turmoil. Which for me is the best kind of movie ride, when you don't know whether to laugh or cry.And finally the acting by all involved is a cut above.  The three principals are superb -- I was bowled over by how involved I got in all three of the lead characters.  And even the lesser characters are well-played and well-defined. Put it all together and you'll have a good time at the movies with this one.  It's frank and it's sexual, but if you stick with it you just may be made to think about life and love and friendship and relationships and your own youth in ways you haven't thought about before.
