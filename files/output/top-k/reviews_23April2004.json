Part of the time it is a poorly-conceived satire, the rest of the time it's a pretty dull cop movie. It's an attempt to catch some of the fire from Natural Born Killers while actually missing its point entirely by working from the good guys' point of view.Instead of Mickey and Malory, we get a pair of Russian immigrants with a video camera. Instead of Wayne Gale we have a rarely seen Kelsey Grammer as a shock-TV host. Where Scagnetti used to be, we now have spotless Robert De Niro the cop, and Edward Burns the righteous arson investigator. The killers aren't complicated human beings with souls, like in Stone's film, instead one is a psycho and the other a dim-witted movie nut. Fresh off the boat, they immediately steal a camcorder and they're off to kill some people they knew back home. When they burn the apartment of their victims, our hero Burns (gag!) shows up. Immediately, he is made out to be an anything-to-bring-down-the-bad-guys type cop (or fireman, the point is he wants to be Dirty Harry). De Niro is the cop\/celebrity-hero who must team up with Burns to bring the foreigners to justice.None of these ideas seem to have been given much thought by writer\/director Herzfeld. Some scenes seem to try to develop character or establish motivation, but it never makes any headway. The plot is really just rubbish and Herzfeld the director never does anything to make us forget this. It wants to be smart and satirical like Natural Born Killers, but it has none of the incredible visuals, editing, performances, or dialogue that made that movie a winner. Meanwhile, it has the same weaknesses as NBK, having zero subtlety and a tendency to preach. Herzfeld's roots as a TV director are obvious all the way through this poor excuse for a movie. The failure of the movie to be original or to pose any real drama around real characters make it dull and uninvolving.This is yet another sad waste of Robert De Niro, who is in more and more crap these days.

'Under Siege' may not be much better than Seagal's other work, but it does provide some edge-of-the-seat action and keeps its audience entertained.

Perhaps the writer\/director, Paul W.S. Anderson, intends some sort of irony, when he serves up this mindless, soulless corpse of a film.  But really, I don't think he's that complex. Drivel of this kind puts even bombs such as 'Tomb Raider' in a good light.The premise involves something along the lines of corporation happily conducting research into viruses, when it all goes terribly wrong, and there's some zombies and some screaming and .. er, some zombies. The plot then takes this premise and promptly sits down. I mean it.  It goes absolutely nowhere.  It's as if the director just wants to string together meaningless, unrelated scenarios from generic computer games.  Characters are suddenly alone, without explanation.  Between scenes, the lead alternates from scared bystander to superhuman commando.  If by this point, you're thinking The only thing that kept this reviewer watching this film to the end was so that he can moan about it afterwards, you'd be utterly correct.Milla Jovovich provides the gratuitous nudity that the director obviously feels belongs in a film like this.  He gets it out of the way at the start of the film, almost as if he's catering for all the viewers who will walk out during the film.  It may seem unfair to dismiss Jovovich like this, but it isn't as if she does any acting in this film.  To be fair, she has absolutely no material to work with, and the director's idea of character development seems to be the progression from wearing a jacket to not wearing a jacket.Michelle Rodriguez garnered critical acclaim for her work in 'Girlfight', but sleepwalks through her role here.  The forgettable male cast repeat tired lines like clockwork; including the immortal We're not getting out of here. We're all going to die. The great Hollywood idea behind making movies based on computer games seems to be 'Neither acting nor development is important, just do some action scenes, and the unwashed masses will be happy.'  Here, even the action scenes disappoint.  Kicks and punches are unconvincing, the gunfights mind-numbingly boring.The tension and gore that are supposed to sell a film in this genre are at least attempted.  The basic problem with tension is that we feel no empathy for the characters, and don't particularly care if they live or die.  The problem with the gore is, like everything else in the film, it is presented in an entirely meaningless way.
