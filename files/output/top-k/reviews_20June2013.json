Directed by Martin Scorcese, this film is still one of the most widely talked about films today. I for one, happened to like this movie despite some unexpected scenes and being a Christian. It's well-written, well-acted, but it takes a long time to get where it wants to go. It's also may more talkative than I may have wished for.Marty's film is not directly based off the gospels themselves, but more about the inner struggles Jesus had between himself and Satan. This film does a good job of making Jesus not perfect like we all think of him as. For example, this film has him going against his father which we don't think of him as.This film is well-acted. Willem Dafoe may have been an odd choice to play Jesus but he did alright in my book. How Harvey Keitel was nominated for a Razzie is beyond me because he made a convincing Judas.Overall, this film is a good film about the less-than-perfect Jesus. It has some powerful scenes especially those involving Satan. I feel like this could use a little less talk and some more action to evenly pace it out. Peter Gabriel's score is unexpectedly awesome and fits into the movie. Even to this day, this ranks with The Passion of the Christ as the most controversial movies out there. It has it flaws, but it works on a high degree. I rate this film 8\/10.

Even when he knew he was going to die, he smiled at his son, and made him laugh. Absolutely full of love this movie is!He showed not one bit of fear in front of his son. I was in awe when I watched this movie. There is no way I could have been so strong for anyone like that. I can only imagine how frightened it must have been back then for those people, as things like this used to happen. Yet I doubt that many would have had the strength that this father had. So sad, yet so beautiful! I definitely want to see this movie again someday soon, even just to remind me about the most important things in life, like the people you love, and not the materialistic things in life, which aren't important. It's definitely a good movie to watch when your going through a rough time, like if you've just lost your job, or had your heart broken, or if your fighting with a friend or family member. It makes you feel grateful and appreciate your life, as things could be a lot worse. I know I was going through a rough time when I watched this movie. I felt so much better afterwards. I was just so grateful that I have a roof over my head, I wasn't in any danger, I have food to eat, a warm bed to sleep in, and other luxuries such as a TV, hot water and electricity, and clean clothes to where, just to name a few.

Because of the turbulence, brigands roam the land raping and pillaging along the way. Having already lost their summer crop of rice to them, a small village has learned that the same band of brigands are planning to return once their winter barley has ripened. Without this crop of barley to sustain them the people in the village will starve to death. Realizing that they are no match against this group of bandits the people go to the village patriarch and ask him what they should to do. He tells them to hire some samurai to protect the village. Unfortunately, they have very little to offer other than a small amount of food. So the village patriarch tells them to find some hungry samurai. With that advice a few of the farmers venture out of their village hoping to find a few samurai who might be willing to help them out. As luck would have it they manage to find one particularly wise samurai named Kambei Shimada (Takashi Shimura) who not only agrees to help them but he also recruits 5 more samurai of exceptional talent to join their cause. Additionally, another warrior named Kikuchiyo (Toshiro Mifune) follows them even though he was initially rejected by Kambei. As a result there are now seven samurai who agree to fight for the village--against 40 brigands. Anyway, rather than spoiling the movie for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this is perhaps one of the best films ever made in Japan. Be advised though that it is a bit long (141 minutes) and the acting is more than a little overly dramatic in the typical Japanese fashion. But there is plenty of action and humor along with a depth that is seldom seen in motion pictures. Not only was it nominated for 2 Academy Awards but it was also remade 6 years later into a western movie known as The Magnificent Seven. Highly recommended to those who enjoy classic films from around the world.

Now, I'm not as daring as him and I won't say Magnolia WILL end up as the best film I ever watched, but so far, I haven't come across a better movie.'Magnolia' is really my favorite movie by some distance. It's biggest strength is how good it dissects its character. This is especially remarkable when you know there are like 10 main characters. Of course some characters are given a bit less screen time, but as a whole, every character gets his fair share of time and we have enough opportunities to get to know everyone and see what it's like to walk in their shoes. This is why the run time of three hours is entirely justified - not a second of it seems wasted.There is not much to say about the plot, especially since I don't want to spoiler anyone. It's just a bunch of more or less ordinary people, all carrying their very own emotional baggage, being followed around for one extraordinary day of their lives, all having to make decisions, all experiencing various emotions. You definitely need to like these kinds of movies, which is why Magnolia is so polarizing. I for one absolutely love character studies and I especially love it when it isn't about soldiers, superheroes, astronauts, killing machines or rock stars, but about people who just struggle to lead a happy life, people without superpowers, but with 'ordinary' problems like me and you. I also don't mind it getting a bit emotional. I basically knew I'd love 'Magnolia' just after reading the one-sentence plot summary here on IMDb, but I never knew how much I would be impressed with it.Needless to say, I love the cast of 'Magnolia'. Tom Cruise gives what I'd call the best performance of his career, Philip Seymour Hofman, although not exactly in a leading role, is always a treat, so is Julianne Moore, and some PTA-regulars like William H. Macy, Luis Guzmán, Philip Baker Hall and the awesome John C. Reilly are present as well.I was also blown away by the style of the movie, which just switches between the characters. While this may not be a particularly new concept, I see it as a very powerful device in 'Magnolia', partly because there are so many people to focus on, partly because of its long run time.So, to conclude this overly enthusiastic review, yeah, I dig 'Magnolia' like crazy.

The year is 1993.In 1993, it's only decades past two drinking fountains and, yet, most barely blink when there's a black lawyer, such as the case in Philadelphia. What other's blink less at is that he's blatantly bigoted. Only because it's against homosexuals.Back then, and I lived then, I came out then, I saw all of this and more from personal experience, gays probably had their biggest onslaught of coming out than in the history of the world. What a wonderful, scary and tranquility time it was. It wasn't easy. We were barely accepted as human.Today, it's much better, but not all there. When the percentages of anti-marriage equality are still in the double digits, we still have issues. But, this movie isn't about all that. It's about hatred and fear and men acting like children.Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks, in his first of two back-to-back deserved Best Actor Oscars) is obviously fired for a couple of reasons, none of which were valid for being gay and having AIDS. Now, remember young ones of 2013 this is when AIDS was incredibly misunderstood and more than 70% of people were still stuck in the Dark Ages, or homophobia. People understood AIDS then as much as they misunderstood gays. Somehow, homosexuals weren't human beings just like them.As a last resort, Andrew turns to what turns out to be an ironically horrible homophobe, Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) to help prosecute the big and definitely bad law firm who fired Andrew.I love court cases, especially movies about them. The fiction, the better. The hard-to-win ones are the best. This one was incredibly hard to prove and to convince a 1993 jury that gays, namely ones with AIDS, have rights, would be an uphill battle by all means. Mercifully, this movie isn't all about that.It's a story of a good man who made a mistake. It's about a man who needs to change &#x96; sorry, but Joe does. It's about idiot big wigs who need to remember that there's a reason we call the dark ages dark.The performances were excellent, the dialogue, script, cinematography and score wonderful. The two best attributes to this, now almost 20-year-old great film, is the heartfelt finale &#x96; yes, I cried&#x85;Goodnight. See you tomorrow&#x85; and the Bruce Springsteen song, Streets of Philadelphia. Not just a powerful song in this movie, but an overall masterpiece of lyrics and music.While some of this does not apply today (2013, 20 years later) and the court case seems a bit mild &#x96; I prefer a little more drama, this movie definitely holds up for the most part and shows our history and our hopes of not repeating this. It's recommended as a deep history of recent and dark past.

Now, remember young ones of 2013 this is when AIDS was incredibly misunderstood and more than 70% of people were still stuck in the Dark Ages, or homophobia. People understood AIDS then as much as they misunderstood gays. Somehow, homosexuals weren't human beings just like them.As a last resort, Andrew turns to what turns out to be an ironically horrible homophobe, Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) to help prosecute the big and definitely bad law firm who fired Andrew.I love court cases, especially movies about them. The fiction, the better. The hard-to-win ones are the best. This one was incredibly hard to prove and to convince a 1993 jury that gays, namely ones with AIDS, have rights, would be an uphill battle by all means. Mercifully, this movie isn't all about that.It's a story of a good man who made a mistake. It's about a man who needs to change &#x96; sorry, but Joe does. It's about idiot big wigs who need to remember that there's a reason we call the dark ages dark.The performances were excellent, the dialogue, script, cinematography and score wonderful. The two best attributes to this, now almost 20-year-old great film, is the heartfelt finale &#x96; yes, I cried&#x85;Goodnight. See you tomorrow&#x85; and the Bruce Springsteen song, Streets of Philadelphia. Not just a powerful song in this movie, but an overall masterpiece of lyrics and music.While some of this does not apply today (2013, 20 years later) and the court case seems a bit mild &#x96; I prefer a little more drama, this movie definitely holds up for the most part and shows our history and our hopes of not repeating this. It's recommended as a deep history of recent and dark past.

The fear is still here, the prejudice breathes, the partners are thrown out of the ER and some are still fired. The year is 1993.In 1993, it's only decades past two drinking fountains and, yet, most barely blink when there's a black lawyer, such as the case in Philadelphia. What other's blink less at is that he's blatantly bigoted. Only because it's against homosexuals.Back then, and I lived then, I came out then, I saw all of this and more from personal experience, gays probably had their biggest onslaught of coming out than in the history of the world. What a wonderful, scary and tranquility time it was. It wasn't easy. We were barely accepted as human.Today, it's much better, but not all there.

The character of Jason Voorheas is definitely a pop culture icon.Friday obviously takes a LOT ideas from other , much better movies like Psycho , Carrie and especially Halloween . The movie makers admit it was John Carpenter's movie that they were trying to cash in and the similarities in story are quite obvious (holiday , prophet of doom trying to war teenagers , stalker and faceless murder , teens having sex). By today standards this movie is generic as hell , but back then in the 1980 this movie along with Halloween became genre defining and highly influential . After it's success they were made TONS of similar movies like Sleepaway camp that were hardly anything , but copies of this one. It's one of the films that to this day still has repercussions.With all this being said , Friday The 13th is not a great movie , or exactly a good one. It's not even a great movie in it's own genre (Halloween and Nightmare on Elm street are FAR better). It's just decent enough to provide some cheap thrills even for a non horror fan like me. It has something in it that makes it fun enough and better than the rest run of the mill slashers.The story is thin and nothing special , however the approach to it is pretty great . The movie feels like a who dunnit type of mystery . We don't know who and why is making the killings and the twist is pretty shocking and clever joke on audience expectations.The movie has teenagers as the main heroes and it is aimed for teenage audience . The killer is symbolically a disapproving conservative parent figure that tries to punish them for unmoral behavior. There are no stereotypical teenagers here , just normal , everyday kids. It's too bad that the screenplay doesn't give them any interesting personalities , they all pretty bland . I guess they work as a sort of everyman type of characters .Director Sean S. Cunningham uses the point-of-view shot from the killer's eyes as he stalks victims and kills them . He wants us to identify with the killer . He makes the audience themselves feel as if they too were being stalked. Maybe he uses that trick too much during the whole movie , but it's an original idea that he fairly pioneered and was copied ever since . It simply works and the settings of the movie also very effective. The stalkings and slaying in broad daylight and open spaces are a twist in a new direction.Harry Manfredini who is responsible for the music tries to imitate the style of Bernard Hermann (Psycho). The score frequently starts chanting Kill, kill, kill. The music is creepy and quite memorable.The movie is nasty and quite sadistic . If you like violence you will be probably satisfied . The movie could had been a bit more bloody and gorier but that is not what the movie is trying to achieve. The special effects do still hold up well.The acting is rather amateurish here , but not necessary terrible . Awful performance by Betsy Palmer , truly worthy a Razzie Award , she almost single handly destroys the movie at the end. Watch out for Kevin Bacon (Footloose) playing one of the victims.Friday the 13th might be a cliché slasher , but is an fairly effective one and too important in movie history to miss .

If you're a real part of the Britney Army, you will know the truth. First of all, the movie is cute. It has a different kind of basic and predictable plot. However, the big climax scene can take your breath away. Second, Britney Jean Spears was not the greatest actress in 2002. In her videos, mainly on her latest, she shows a big change from the girl she was ten years ago. She may not be the best actress, but she's not the biggest mistake in the movie. Third, and the biggest error, the movie lacks... time. Yes. For what I remember, the plot takes time in a road trip across USA - OK, those movies are funny. But once they decide Britney will be the lead singer on the audition, the time goes quicker. The moment when she learns the tune to Not a girl, not yet a woman must be the greatest mistake on the movie. Still, despite the not-so-brilliant acting skill from Britney, the movie is pretty watchable. And it's pretty entertaining (even though you know from the start she's ending up with the bad guy). Fourth, Britney is a make money machine since she started her career. As a fan who loves her to death, I can admit that she's not the talentest singer out there. She has no lack of talent. What she has is an awful team behind her actions. She's like a doll in her hands. Believe me when I say she needs no auto-tune or to sing about dance clubs to sell music - Everytime, Not A girl, not yet a woman, Don't let me be the last to know, He about to lose me, or even the unreleased Everyday and Strangest Love are proofs of that. But her team musn't think that way, because they use auto-tune on her and... did this movie. Yes, this movie is a way of earning money thanks to Britney, because every fan of Britney will love this.

He died at ninety one.So your granddad liked the movie for the uniforms.He gave me this tin soldier. See. I still got it.. I thought I take it with me and show you. Kristl held up a tin soldier with colors that was neither the blue of the Continental army nor the red of the British one. It was green with red.So what uniform is this?Brunswick. German?Yes, but there was no Germany back then. All kind of small and big states. Some were allied to Britain. Like Hessia and Hanover.So the Germans were with the English?Well, there were Germans fighting for the Americans to. In the French army that helped out the Americans. And there was a whole regiment made up from German colonists. Kristl stared at the tin soldier.Ok?Well, he said. It would have been a nice movie without Mel Gibson standing in the way. If they had just kept out the action bits. Like the silly fights. And the dumb warfare.That is what he said.What? Without Mel there is no movie. What is a movie without action, a hero and a good bad guy?A shorter movie? Kristl said cheerfully.And a boring movie too. Except for crazy old men who play with tin soldiers.Well. I thought they could have made two movies out of it and please both sides.It is long enough for it.Nope. I don't think so. Henry shook his head, It would be a short nonsensical action movie and a boring historical one. They go together.It was just a thought. Kristl said.

Even Pixar's first masterpiece Toy Story is quickly approaching twenty, which is equally unfathomable in any state of mind. Rewatching Monster's, Inc., in light of the upcoming prequel, I couldn't help but realize that Pixar hasn't changed a whole lot in their animation style. Little noticeable additions and upgrades such as lighting and texturing have been made, but changes like that are pretty much unnoticeable to the public. Pixar has been one of the few companies that has done little innovation to the overall layout and design of their animation since their breakout in 1995.Pixar, however, has to remain witty, original, and subversive in their material and story lines to remain the almighty, animation patriarch they've always been. In 2013, I'm proud to save I've never been letdown by a Pixar film so much so that I gave it a negative review. Even their lesser stories are better than Disney's average ones, and even a good Dreamworks movie is not usually the equivalent of an average Pixar one. Monsters, Inc. is a story that is cinematic bread-and-butter, combining the quirks and uniqueness of monsters and articulating their appeal to children wonderfully in a film. While the subject matter may have you thinking otherwise, this is a sweetly appropriate film for children over five, and unlike maybe some modern animated releases such as Hotel Transylvania this one doesn't segregate the viewer solely because they've seen more modern monster films than everyone in the audience.The plot concerns Mike (voiced by the lovable Billy Crystal), a stout, green, Cyclops-esque monster and his pal Sulley (John Goodman), a lovable, furry, blue monster and their duties at Monsters, Inc. The company is dedicated to frightening children of all ages after hours, and to do so, they use a series of doors, assigned to each monster. The doors look like they lead nowhere, but actually house a child's room behind them. When a monster walks back through the door, it is extracted from the ground and taken through an elaborate conveyor belt behind the scenes.Mike and Sulley always find themselves harassed by Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi), who leaves a door on the floor, allowing a child to enter the premises so he can get them kicked out of Monsters, Inc. The child is two years old, unafraid of monsters, and thinks of Sulley as a lovable teddy-bear rather than a ferocious monster. The film follows Mike and Sulley as they try and hide the girl - who they nickname Boo (Mary Gibbs) - from their boss and try to keep their jobs intact.There's a surprising (and equally unsurprising) zealous energy to the material here. By having such a loose plot, the characters are free to roam in many different directions, trying to find a way to keep precious little Boo hidden from all the other monsters.Speaking of the other monsters, Pixar's creativity as a group seems to bleed through Monsters, Inc. as each character has their own artistic design and color scheme to go with them. No two monsters look alike, and none look anything like the classic movie monsters or basic retreads of them, showing Pixar's high creativity. Even if you remain unfazed by the story or the plot, the art design of the characters is something that will hold your attention for quite sometime.Monsters, Inc. is a charming affair that should be equally rewarding for adults as it will be their children. There's no reliance on immaturity, stupidity, or even blatant shallowness. There's a simple story handled appropriately under solid conditions from a great studio. What more do you need? Voiced by Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, and Mary Gibbs. Directed by Pete Docter.

While any typical road movie could have served as an effective vehicle for the propagation of this quaint tale, Jarmusch defiantly opts to make a Western based on his belief that the Western as a genre is very open to metaphor, and has deep roots in classical narrative forms. But, Dead Man is far from being a conventional Western. Jarmusch basically leverages upon flexibility of the form and its umbilical link to America to concoct a far more complex work of art that not only transcends genres, but also deals with existential and spiritual motifs. With Dead Man, Jarmusch succeeds in giving the Western genre his personal touch by ingeniously building upon the aforementioned complex motifs to formulate a powerful cinematic treatise enriched with several vital elements of poetry be it metaphors, symbolism, allusion, or imagery. Depp's character in Dead Man is a namesake of the English poet William Blake. The association obviously is not limited to the name alone. Dead Man has multiple references to the poetry of William Blake. In fact, most of Exaybachay's recitations in the movie are taken from Blake's poems like The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, Auguries of Innocence, The Everlasting Gospel, etc. Anyone who has seen the movie would remember the bizarrely sublime (taken from the aforementioned Marriage) The eagle never lost so much time, as when he submitted to learn from the crow. Thel (beautifully played by Mili Avital), the name of the prostitute who sells paper flowers, is also a reference to William Blake's The Book of Thel. And to top it all, the all-knowing Exaybachay, an ardent William Blake admirer, believes the accountant Blake to be a reincarnation of the dead English poet. Overall, Dead Man is an endlessly fascinating work of cinema that is bound to elicit extreme responses from its audience one would either love it or detest it, no midway affair. The deftly blended humor and suspense gives the movie an eerie tone which plainly reflects the nauseating feeling, as experienced by movie's characters, of being stuck in a limbo. An existential Western with surrealistic overtones, the movie is equally brilliant on both the technical and emotional fronts. It wouldn't be a hyperbole to say that Dead Man serves to be a brilliant showcase of the very best in direction, cinematography, music and acting. Dead Man is not a film for a casual viewer. The patient viewer, however, would be thoroughly rewarded. The movie may require multiple viewings for a clearer and deeper understanding.

I'm sure this will be remembered as one of the best movies of all time.First off, the acting. Liam Neeson is a great actor overall and shows his excellence in this movie, playing Oskar Schindler. For me, the best actor in this movie is Ralph Fiennes. His role as Amon Goeth is simply amazing. I once read one of the survivors of the Holocaust visited the set and started shaking when she met Ralph Fiennes because he portrayed such a resemblance of Amon Goeth. I can completely understand that. The way he acts in this movie, the way his character thinks are very well thought of. Ralph Fiennes is truly terrifying in this movie, which is a remarkable feat and an Honor to witness.Secondly, I applaud the choice of Stephen Spielberg to film this movie in black and white. It makes the entire war seem sinister, dark and intriguing. The tiny aspect of the movie in color, the young girl in the red coat is beautiful.

Between scenes, there would be such large gaps in time that you wouldn't be able to tell how a situation arose or what the situation was in some cases, making the story hard to follow. These factors limited my ability to feel the exhaustion and suffering of the characters, and left me slightly disengaged.The reason for my high mark, however, is attributed to the final scenes. The raw emotion coming from the few remaining actors is highly visible on this precious smaller scope, and the eventual plight of each character is played out in such devastating detail that I sat in silence in a dark room long after the credits had finished rolling and felt compelled after to even write some poetry.If you came to this film to see the struggle of a battle, you could do better, but stick around for the ending, it's very much worth it.

When a financially troubled car salesman hires and makes a deal with two people to kidnap his wife as a ruse to get his wealthy father-in-law to cough up money, you can already predict that something could go wrong, especially when these two people aren't the most professional.While the movie can be oddly humorous, it really adds a strange dynamic effect when coupled with its winter setting, in that it gives a sense of desolation that is reflected in Jerry Lundegaard's life and really adds a lot more weight to the morbidity that carries on and escalates throughout the beginning of the film to the end. Fargo feels like a very morbid movie to me, but to add in some of the most quirky humor really makes the movie feel very idiosyncratic in that it seems incomparable to other films, with all of its distinct characters and its very strange, cold and sterile atmosphere. While Pulp Fiction does do a good job of combining humor and morbidity, I think I have come to favor Fargo a lot more.What I love about Fargo is how distinct every major character is in the movie. The writing that went into him, coupled with each actor being able to breathe life into their character and giving them their own unique quirks was one of the things that kept me glued to the screen. From the mild mannered behaviors to the Minnesota accents, the characters come off very authentic in presenting a very regional film. If I would have to give a nod to any one performance in the film, it would have to be Frances McDormand. From her mild mannerisms to her unintentional humor, Marge was the foundation of the story and McDormand further accentuated that with her superb acting in that she makes her portrayal feel so authentic to its region, believable and at the utmost, human. To witness all the events in the film and to react the way she did is commendable, to say the least and I think that Marge Gunderson has got to be one of the coolest female characters on film that I have witnessed and I cannot praise the Coen brothers enough for writing such a great non-stereotypical female character.Fargo may be a simple story, but I think that it's simplicity is what I really love about this film. I watched enough films from the Coen brothers to deem them as very unique in their style of telling stories that feels so different from other directors. Fargo basically sealed the deal for me. With its unique characteristics, it feels very surreal in a morbid sense. I have never described a film that way and I think that shows how special this film is. If you want to watch a film that has character, then watch 'Fargo,' because it definitely has a whole bunch of that.

Two Jakes is vastly inferior to Chinatown. Even the best elements from this sequel (the dialogue and acting) are less impressive than in Polanski's classic. Why this movie was made after 16 years ? Chinatown didn't really needed a sequel .The movie is set fifteen years after the events shown in Chinatown . Jake Gittes is still haunted by the past , while there is new mystery on the horizon. Unsuspringly the new mystery will be someway connected with the old case&#x85; I strongly suggest you should watch Chinatown before this one.The biggest plus of the movie is the acting of Jack Nicholson and Harvey Keitel . Both gave great performances mainly because the script gives them a lot to play with. On the other side the acting of Meg Tilly and Madeline Stowe is rather bad . Tilly lacks charisma , while Stowe is terribly over-acting . The other actors provide capable support .The screenplay as other reviewers mentioned is the biggest problem of the movie . The dialogues are definitely good and I have enjoyed more or less subtle references to Chinatown . It was nice to see all of the various supporting characters that previously appeared in Polanski's movie. Unfortunately , Towne's screenplay feels like a retread of Chinatown. Water is replaced with oil , there is another rich old guy and so on&#x85; The story uses too many elements from previous movie that seem awfully contrived as they are woven into the current plot . There is one big twist that isn't a twist at all , because it's so obvious (Do I know you ?). Compare that to the twist in Chinatown . Now that was a BIG TWIST &#x85; There are also some awfully laughable moments (footsteps , explosion) and good moments (twist with the chair , joke on the golf court). Some characters appear , but have no effect on the whole story (fiancé , oil man ).The movie obviously tries to tell something about the past, how it pervades our lives for the rest of our days, and how we assimilate it into our futures. It feels honest , even if not quite convincing. I also liked the use of voice-over. It certainly helps to create a mood to the film.Jack Nicholson's direction is bland and unimaginative , but in his defense there is one good scene filled with tension (Suck it) . Two Jakes also shows the viewer a convincing re-creation of 1948 Los Angeles. The music by Van Dyke Parks is completely forgettable and lame compared to Goldsmith score from Chinatown. Director of photography Vilmos Zsigmond capture a Los Angeles of burnt out dreams, on the brink of over-development and over-expansion.There were going to do a third movie - Cloverleaf , but it never got made after the failure of this one. This was the second part of a supposed trilogy, all based, according to Towne, on natural goods (Chinatown - water, Two Jakes- earth, Cloverleaf-air pollution).With a better screenplay , director and music Two Jakes could have been a really solid movie.
