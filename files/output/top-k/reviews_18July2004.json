The way director Adrian Lyne shows that a marriage doesn't necessarily have to be in trouble for one partner to stray is very realistic, and makes the movie far more interesting because we know how much Connie (played fantastically by Diane Lane) stands to lose if her affair is ever exposed. Connie's lover Paul is played by Olivier Martinez, and I think he was equally fantastic. He just brought his character to life, and I think a lot of his appeal is largely because he's French! But he's so interesting to watch in this movie, I just loved watching the way Connie and Paul were captivated by each other. And it's all in the looks and the body language, not the dialogue. When you see Connie trying to resist Paul you only have to look at her to know what she really wants. The interaction and the chemistry Lane and Martinez had together was amazing, and for me it made the movie. Richard Gere is good and actually plays a likeable character, not arrogant and aggressive like the majority of characters he's played. All the characters are very likeable in fact, even Paul despite us having half an idea he has other women too and knowingly pursued a married woman. And we like Connie because we can see she's devoted to her family but when it comes to Paul she's powerless to resist. What I loved about this movie was the way that Connie and Paul literally blew into each other, and thus their fate was sealed. ***SPOILER!!!*** Meeting Connie ultimately led to Paul's death, and for Connie life would never be the same. It was a very touching portrayal of showing how one moment in your life can change everything. It was an accident, neither of them went looking for each other. Initially there isn't even any sexual attraction between them, which was an effective way of getting the audience to like Paul. He helped Connie because she was hurt, not because he wanted to get her into bed. Despite what he ends up doing with her we know right away that he's a caring man, but also too weak and selfish to ignore his desires. And I'm sure the majority of people have been guilty of that once or twice, whether it's indulging in an affair or having a sneaky chocolate bar when we're supposed to be dieting! I'm sure those people who've been in Connie's position would tell us that having an affair does NOT mean you no longer care about your family.

The camera work and overall filming style is, well, stylish, and looks very cool. I liked the use of slow-motion, fast-motion and instantly changing angles, not to mention the well-placed quick cuts.

He is a director who creates and creates, which is interesting, because most of his films are based on published pieces of literature. He has gone from genres such as crime ('Killer's Kiss', 'The Killing') to war ('Paths of Glory', 'Full Metal Jacket') to satire ('Dr. Strangelove', 'Barry Lyndon), and even more. He envokes a rare visual beauty within his films, and he creates perfection in every frame. 'Eyes Wide Shut' is no exception.Here we have such mainstream actors as Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Sydney Pollack, Alan Cumming, and even Leelee Sobieski. But Kubrick doesn't fail them, and they don't fail Kubrick. Each actor listed, and more (Todd Field, Vanessa Shaw) give powerful performances. Tom Cruise, who many slam for being such a mainstream actors, proves his ability to act here. Nicole Kidman, who also is a mainstream actress, though more praised in the film world, also gives a genuine performance. We have caricatures here the wealthy and kind doctor (Tom Cruise), the attractive wife (Nicole Kidman), the wealthy and corrupt friend (Sydney Pollack), and the hooker with a heart of gold (Vanessa Shaw). These people feel real. They're dialogue is not especially extremely quote- able, but they sound like human beings, saying stupid things or not. The film is calculated, no doubt, but in a way that gives us what is intended. Tom Cruise is Dr. Bill Harford, who resorts to his profession as a doctor and his kindness as an escape, while walking around New York at night after his wife's stoned confession about near- infidelity. He is jealous, even though he says he's not the jealous type. He lies to her, but she saves him nonetheless. Through his experiences, he understands more and more about things he didn't want to know about. Is Tom Cruise good? No doubt. Even though I prefer him in his other 1999 feature, 'Magnolia', he still gives a good performance as the kind- hearted but somewhat ignorant doctor. You can feel his anguish, and his confusion. Life was going perfect for him, he had a good time with his rich friend, Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack), and he came home fine. He is thrown awry by the confession of his wife (Nicole Kidman), because he lives in the notion that she would never lie to him, and he would never lie to her. She quips to him, You are AWFULLY sure of yourself! and he replies with No! I'm sure of you!. She proceeds into a laughing fit then proceeds to tell him about her near infidelity. Nicole Kidman, an actress I feel that seems to lack a passion for performing, uses her cold air here perfectly. On the surface, she is a kind, gentle, loving woman but underneath she is filled with angst. Sydney Pollack as Victor Ziegler gives the audience the best performance of the film. He is commanding, he is greedy and selfish, but he gets what he wants. In one scene by a pool table, he talks to Bill about an incident both were involved in, and you can feel the corruption. The supporting cast does the job as well. Todd Field plays Nick, a pianist who helps Bill when he shouldn't, and a somewhat sleazy character. Vanessa Shaw is sexy as the prostitute, and she plays it correctly. And last, but not least, Alan Cumming is hysterical as the gay receptionist who helps Bill with some information about Nick. In some cases, the lead actors in Kubrick's films over- shadow the rest of the cast (see 'A Clockwork Orange'), but here he manages to balance everyone out. And it works.Say what you will about the slow pacing of Kubrick's film, but he has a fantastic visual eye. The cinematography by Larry Smith is fantastic, giving the film a dream like quality. The colors are lush and poetic, and give the film the perfect tone. The haunting musical score by Jocelyn Cook is also fantastic, especially the chilling simple- noted piano music. The film editing by Nigel Galt gives the film the right pace, making it not too fast paced, but not too slow either. There is no awkward editing, the film feels smooth and just right. While I've always thought Kubrick is more talented at directing than he he is at writing, his and Frederic Raphael's screenplay is excellent. The dialog, while it may at times sound contrived and even silly, is perfect because the characters feel genuine. Bill is kind- hearted, but not ready for the tough part of the world. Alice is honest, but loves her husband and child. Victor is greedy and morally shakey, but he is an effective man who gets what he wants out of life and has no remorse. The story is an interesting one, and it is an important examination of sex in people's lives. Detractors who say the film is about nothing but sex are missing the point completely. It is about human interaction, which at times, is sex, but also about themes such as love, friendship, trust, honesty, and more.And boy, is Kubrick a talented director. He brings everything together, he has directed the actors perfectly and has woven a masterful tale. The orgy scene is one of the most brilliant and visually stunning films in cinematic history, as well as one of the most bizarre. The momentum of the film builds up, and never lets down as characters have unexpected confrontations. 'Eyes Wide Shut' is dramatic, but not overly dramatic, and emphasis is put in exactly the right places. 'Eyes Wide Shut' opened in the summer of 1999, amongst many detractors. Not only was it seen by Stanley Kubrick fans, but also fans of mainstream stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. For me, it is the masters's best work, and a representation of the brillaince of cinema. It is quite possibly, the greatest film ever made. So turn off your expectations, and ignore the terrible reviews, and watch 'Eyes Wide Shut'. You won't forget it.

He envokes a rare visual beauty within his films, and he creates perfection in every frame. 'Eyes Wide Shut' is no exception.Here we have such mainstream actors as Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Sydney Pollack, Alan Cumming, and even Leelee Sobieski. But Kubrick doesn't fail them, and they don't fail Kubrick. Each actor listed, and more (Todd Field, Vanessa Shaw) give powerful performances. Tom Cruise, who many slam for being such a mainstream actors, proves his ability to act here. Nicole Kidman, who also is a mainstream actress, though more praised in the film world, also gives a genuine performance. We have caricatures here the wealthy and kind doctor (Tom Cruise), the attractive wife (Nicole Kidman), the wealthy and corrupt friend (Sydney Pollack), and the hooker with a heart of gold (Vanessa Shaw). These people feel real. They're dialogue is not especially extremely quote- able, but they sound like human beings, saying stupid things or not. The film is calculated, no doubt, but in a way that gives us what is intended. Tom Cruise is Dr. Bill Harford, who resorts to his profession as a doctor and his kindness as an escape, while walking around New York at night after his wife's stoned confession about near- infidelity. He is jealous, even though he says he's not the jealous type. He lies to her, but she saves him nonetheless. Through his experiences, he understands more and more about things he didn't want to know about. Is Tom Cruise good? No doubt. Even though I prefer him in his other 1999 feature, 'Magnolia', he still gives a good performance as the kind- hearted but somewhat ignorant doctor. You can feel his anguish, and his confusion. Life was going perfect for him, he had a good time with his rich friend, Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack), and he came home fine. He is thrown awry by the confession of his wife (Nicole Kidman), because he lives in the notion that she would never lie to him, and he would never lie to her. She quips to him, You are AWFULLY sure of yourself! and he replies with No! I'm sure of you!. She proceeds into a laughing fit then proceeds to tell him about her near infidelity. Nicole Kidman, an actress I feel that seems to lack a passion for performing, uses her cold air here perfectly. On the surface, she is a kind, gentle, loving woman but underneath she is filled with angst. Sydney Pollack as Victor Ziegler gives the audience the best performance of the film. He is commanding, he is greedy and selfish, but he gets what he wants. In one scene by a pool table, he talks to Bill about an incident both were involved in, and you can feel the corruption. The supporting cast does the job as well. Todd Field plays Nick, a pianist who helps Bill when he shouldn't, and a somewhat sleazy character. Vanessa Shaw is sexy as the prostitute, and she plays it correctly. And last, but not least, Alan Cumming is hysterical as the gay receptionist who helps Bill with some information about Nick. In some cases, the lead actors in Kubrick's films over- shadow the rest of the cast (see 'A Clockwork Orange'), but here he manages to balance everyone out. And it works.Say what you will about the slow pacing of Kubrick's film, but he has a fantastic visual eye. The cinematography by Larry Smith is fantastic, giving the film a dream like quality. The colors are lush and poetic, and give the film the perfect tone. The haunting musical score by Jocelyn Cook is also fantastic, especially the chilling simple- noted piano music. The film editing by Nigel Galt gives the film the right pace, making it not too fast paced, but not too slow either. There is no awkward editing, the film feels smooth and just right. While I've always thought Kubrick is more talented at directing than he he is at writing, his and Frederic Raphael's screenplay is excellent. The dialog, while it may at times sound contrived and even silly, is perfect because the characters feel genuine. Bill is kind- hearted, but not ready for the tough part of the world. Alice is honest, but loves her husband and child. Victor is greedy and morally shakey, but he is an effective man who gets what he wants out of life and has no remorse. The story is an interesting one, and it is an important examination of sex in people's lives. Detractors who say the film is about nothing but sex are missing the point completely. It is about human interaction, which at times, is sex, but also about themes such as love, friendship, trust, honesty, and more.And boy, is Kubrick a talented director. He brings everything together, he has directed the actors perfectly and has woven a masterful tale. The orgy scene is one of the most brilliant and visually stunning films in cinematic history, as well as one of the most bizarre. The momentum of the film builds up, and never lets down as characters have unexpected confrontations. 'Eyes Wide Shut' is dramatic, but not overly dramatic, and emphasis is put in exactly the right places. 'Eyes Wide Shut' opened in the summer of 1999, amongst many detractors. Not only was it seen by Stanley Kubrick fans, but also fans of mainstream stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. For me, it is the masters's best work, and a representation of the brillaince of cinema. It is quite possibly, the greatest film ever made. So turn off your expectations, and ignore the terrible reviews, and watch 'Eyes Wide Shut'. You won't forget it.

If you happen to like Capra-esquire movies, you will adore The Majestic. If you think they are silly, sentimental and simplistic, you won't. It's just that simple.The movie plot runs on two levels. Jim Carrey, playing straight, is Peter Appleton, a B-movie screenwriter in 1951 Hollywood who is trying to break into A-pictures when he is accused of being a Communist by the House Un-American Activities Committee. As the witch hunt begins to unfold, he has a traffic accident that ends with him and his car falling into a river. He is carried out to sea only to be washed up on the beach below Lawson, California - with no memory of who he is, his past life, or how he got there.He is promptly mistaken for Luke Trimble, a local hero missing and presumed dead by the entire town, who like 62 other Lawson boys gave his life for his country in World War II. Lawson's sacrifice was recognized by President Roosevelt declaring the town a national monument and sending a bronze sculpture to commemorate its dead. However, the town's losses have caused Lawson to lose its heart and its way.The reappearance of 'Luke,' and Peter's actions taken in another man's shoes, revitalize the town beginning with Luke's father, Harry (Martin Landau, in a great role) and The Majestic, the theatre owned by the Trimbles, which Harry had closed in 1942 presumably on learning of Luke's death. While Adele, the doctor's daughter (and Luke's fiancée) tries to restore 'Luke's' memory, Peter and Harry refurbish and reopen The Majestic, and bring life back to the town. All is going well in 'Luke's' life... until the investigators for the HUAC show up with a subpoena a couple of days after Harry's death - on the day of Harry's funeral, in fact - and coincidentally after Peter's regaining his memory.Peter's agent also shows up. He has news. It has occurred to the HUAC that in Peter's case, perhaps they are mistaken; but they have to save face. All Peter, a man who has never had much in the way of personal convictions, has to do is stand up at an HUAC hearing in Los Angeles and read a prepared statement in which he abjures his membership in the Communist Party, apologizes for his error, promises to mend his ways and name names, and all will be forgiven. He'll get his life back. His A-list film, which the studio shelved, will go back into production. He'll get everything he ever wanted.But Peter has a problem. It's Luke, you see. He was not just a local hero. He was a Hero with a capital H, and Peter has been him for a few months, as Adele points out to him; and when Luke reaches out from the past to touch Peter, Peter is ready to listen.If you are a Capra fan, you can guess the ending and will approve. If you aren't, you'll say this is a mixture of schmaltz and hokum with just a dash of idealism and SO not realistic. And if you say that, I say you're wrong.Capra could have made this picture, with Jimmy Stewart as Peter\/Luke, June Allyson as Adele, Edward Arnold as the head of the HUAC, and a whole bunch of MGM's old reliable character actors in the supporting roles. The movie is a throwback to a more innocent time when people still believed in heroes and dared to dream about more than just maintaining the status quo. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it an 8; and I wish Carrey would make more movies like this. He's a better straight actor than he is given credit for.

That is why I liked this movie....I could relate to the two major characters.A few things left me (and perhaps others) in the dark1) The outer space shots did not make much sense. Just a little more information might have helped us understand the alien. It not clear why it (or they) is trying to take over earth. Is it for taking over the earth or the space program or both.2) Captain Alex Streck, Nick Cassavetes, is also taken over by an alien in space. Though it is not quite understood why he went through such physical trauma and Spencer did not. 3) Joe Morton, who plays Sherman Reese, the NASA Representative, does an okay job playing his character. Again, this movie does not explain, to any degree of satisfaction, what Mr. Reese knows.4) The character of Nan, Jillian's sister, seems to have no reason for being in the movie. Except a useless filler used in detergents?5) I found it interesting that an old radio, in the Armacost's apartment was used as the main 'stereo' system.....I could go on abit about the details....but no need to be that picky.Bravo on the cinematography, to an extent!

Be warned, you will likely need to watch it more than once to catch all the information.  The plot moves quickly, and the set up for heist is intricate, as well as fascinating.  The actual culmination of the heist is broken up though, and I found that a bit frustrating to have a review of key elements after the fact.  The rapport between Brad Pitt and George Clooney is excellent.  There is a distinct feeling that the cast enjoyed working together on this film.  The lavish background of Las Vegas coincided quite well with the lavish theme of thievery here.  If you are going to plot out the job, make it big.  One thing I found interesting is there was never an estimate of what the cost of this heist was, and whether or not that figured into the net winnings of the participants.  The scenes involving some young and popular sitcom actors learning poker from Brad Pitt will remain amusing to review from time to time as these up and coming actors gain notoriety in the coming years.

It has been given a split decision by the viewing public but has been better received than Unbreakable. It has been difficult for Shyamalan to score another box office knock-out since The Sixth Sense largely because it was such a huge hit that it was a quantum leap. This is similar to Bob Beamon's record setting long jump in Mexico City, 1968 Olympics that shattered the previous record by almost two feet when mere inches or fractions of inches are the usual progression. Beamon spent the rest of his track and field career just trying to approach it, let alone surpass it. I hope Shyamalan's career does not have to endure the same kind of relentless expectation. Shyamalan's movies are now compared to that original leap which is why a lot is missed in his two works since. But I don't believe The Sixth Sense is his standard for making his movies. Each one is its own entity not seeking to match another. It will be interesting to see how The Village is received. I think the mark of Shyamalan's genius as a filmmaker is that you can't fully digest his work in a single sitting. Even though he borrows philosophy and technique from previous filmmakers, Shyamalan displays his own passion for brewing these ingredients into his own stew.Signs is funny and scary. So we know that crop circles can be and, to the best of our knowledge, are man-made? That doesn't mean that alien spacecrafts can't use them as navigation makers. Furthermore, where did we get the idea from anyway? How would you react if you suspected that aliens were assembling in your backyard for something yet to come? We know very little about them, how much do they know about us? What are their intentions -- exploration, conquest, enslavement? What are our inferences -- friendship, hostility, doom? They are obviously technologically advanced of us in space travel and seemingly biologically advanced in locomotion. How do we get out of this one? Coincidently, we must keep the faith!

The action set pieces are stunning and violent. And with Mars as the back drop theme for the story, it makes great viewing.

Its graduates...uh, actors include Kate Bosworth, Michelle Rodriguez, and a bunch of other pretty people you've never heard of. Bosworth is Anne Marie, the super-talented surfer with a confidence problem. Before the movie is half over, she's in love with a pro quarterback and struggling to gumption up for the big all-girls surf championship. It's your standard 1980's Tom Cruise picture.If a movie with such modest ambitions is supposed to make you want to go out and take up surfing, I say, hand me my 'Point Break' DVD instead. Sure, 'Blue Crush' is professionally made and the camerawork is fine, but how hard is it to pretty up shots of the Hawaiian ocean when it's in the form of gorgeous, humungoid waves? That's a natural beauty that speaks for itself and doesn't need Hollywood to flaunt it. As for the screenplay by Lizzy Weiss & Stockwell, well, they're proficient with the surfing lingo. They're also absentminded enough to bury their various hanging plot threads in an undertow. The flick is not trying to be a deep meditation on the entire wave-lovin' experience, but that's no excuse for staggering along with such a sub-par story.As unremarkable as they may be, the female leads are about the best thing in the film. They all look smart in bathing suits---the words woo hoo come to mind---and they're fairly natural. Plus, these likable babes don't grate with too many, you go, girl comments. Rodriguez even smiled once or twice, which confirms that she DOES have more facial expressions than just snarling and pouting. But despite the physical beauty of the waves and the girls, the film they're in is generic goop. Parents will be happy that all the sex is kiss-kiss-fadeout, there's nary a drug, and only a handful of cuss words. All the same, I'm certainly not happy with the content of 'Blue Crush'. It's just not tubular, dude.

The opening scene with the charge of Thulsa Doom's cavalry on Conan's village gives you a good idea of what this movie is going to be like  Epic!
