Having watched this movie after some of the great Italian as well as American westerns from the 60's and 70's, I was quite disappointed.The story was quite weak, which in itself would not have been such a huge deal if there was some kind of depth and history to the preacher's character in relation to his old nemesis the marshal and his deputies (having them all standing in line wearing the same type and color trench coat looked rather comical). The only reference to the past were some scars Clint had, showing six gunshots he had somehow survived (Yeah, right) then, in turn, shooting the marshal in the same gunshot pattern with one additional shot to the head. So we know they were enemies in the past. That's all we know. How did Clint become a gunfighter? How did he become a preacher? What was the feud about?The romance side plot was rather silly, I guess when you direct and produce a movie in which you are the star, you can have a beautiful 15 year old girl and her mom both fall in love with you. Many other small details bugged me as well The Kung Fu like scene at the beginning, in which Clint kicks all these guys' asses, didn't look very good; the final showdown scene was full of overstated clichés the hat on the ground, the oil lamp dangling in the wind, telling the restaurant owners to take a walk, etc. In addition, the way he took out the six deputies and the marshal was just too easy. Overall, the dialog was weak. The scene where the girl stood at the edge of town calling Goodbye and I love you with those dreadful echoes was embarrassing. What did Richard Kiel add to the movie? I also thought Clint didn't look too good in this movie, it almost seemed like he just had some dental work done and he was in pain. And so on.Was there anything to like? A little the scenery was nice; the camera work was good although nothing radical was demanded of it; a small part for Chris Penn. That's about itThe best I can say about this movie is that it probably won't really hurt you if you watched it on some rainy afternoon with nothing else to do.5 out of 10.

It is the tale of two newlyweds (Melanie Griffith as Patty; Matt Modine as Drake), slightly short on reasonable income, who buy a hefty house in Pacific Heights. Being a larger house than they initially intended to buy, they rent out the floors. One goes to a polite Asian couple. The other, to a wealthy man (Michael Keaton as Carter Hayes) who is in the business of real estate scams. Carter is the worst case scenario of a tenant. Short of murdering the landlords and fellow tenants, he moves in rather quickly and bypasses much of the background checks by telling the impressionable young couple a bunch of lies (actually, it's pretty much Drake's fault for rushing into everything without adequately checking up on Hayes). Then, without every paying up the rent or deposit, he hangs around just long enough to get tenant's rights (or at least a presumption of rights, after which the already tight-budget couple would have to sue to claim misrepresentation and everything) and keep the couple from kicking him out. Gradually, terrorizing them as he had done so many times before. It's all part of his scam.Michael Keaton is terrific as the elusive and obviously strange and brutally eerie Carter Hayes. He is so creepy, I think that's what makes the movie so suspenseful like the scene when he's hanging out in the basement when the power goes out. Or the final revenge sequence in the hotel (perhaps the finale is one of the greatest revenge sequences ever in a movie!). The guy who's made it his purpose to raise as much hell as possible to get what he wants. But, this may well be the last time Carter gets away with it. Patty and Drake seem to fall apart when their tenant not only refuses to leave, but makes trouble for the other tenants (in a pretty gross way).Drake doesn't handle the situation too well. The couple immediately feel helpless when even the law fails to rid them of Carter Hayes. The viewer, too, gets on edge about Carter Hayes. How do you make a guy like this get the f*ck out of your home? (That's one of the great elements of suspense, in a way, we feel like the invasion of Patty and Drake's home is like an invasion of our own. That's just how powerful a character like Carter Hayes is). And Drake's form of vigilante justice isn't the smartest way of handling the situation, using fists of fury rather than intellect, which seems to only exacerbate the couple's problems. In fact, Patty is the one responsible for the fantastic events that create one of the best revenge scenes and really give Carter Hayes his own just deserts.Pacific Heights really is a fantastic thriller. Some might not appreciate Matthew Modine being cast as Drake here. A part like this might've called for someone less dorky, since Drake wasn't really a straggly guy, he was just a guy who wanted to get rid of Carter too fast without really thinking about the smartest way of going about it. However, Melanie Griffith works great in her role as Patty. Nonetheless, it is really good stuff, a thriller that you're sure to enjoy!

I find this a good conflict and a justifiable reason for someone to go to war - as if revenging his family wasn't enough; and this is where the movie starts falling apart. Following the mould of Braveheart and Gladiator, The Patriot is yet another story about a man who goes to war to avenge his dead family at the hands of a tyrant. I don't have a problem with ideas and stories being recycled - where would poor Shakespeare be if everyone thought so? - but The Patriot doesn't pull off this idea with any new innovation or depth or particular panache.The characters are very one-dimensional, although the filmmakers try to compensate this for giving everyone a lot of anger... that's not good enough, I'm sorry. The dialogue is uninspired and uninspiring, really - cliched at best! All the family relationships are played as traditionally, without anything new to look for; the characters react to the others like you expect them to, because you've seen it before thousands times, and you just know what their lines are and how they're going to deliver them. It's really annoying being able to second-guess every next scene.The subplots aren't really great either - for some reason Benjamin falls in love for his dead wife's sister, although that's not really developed in the movie, and that's a good thing - the best, though, would have been to avoid just this cliche. Not every movie needs to be a love story - there was already a potential father\/son relationship to explore, which was underdeveloped, instead - and people will see right through the forced ones. Which leads me to Gabriel and Anne's own love story - okay, I can buy the two love each other, but wasn't their marriage really just a reason for Anne to be killed so Gabriel would try to avenge her in a rash act of stupid bravery and die, so then his father will try and avenge him in the climatic battle. It's not like he wouldn't participate in it if Gabriel had survived, so what's the point of marrying him off in one scene and killing the wife right in the next? It's so rushed and again forced, it obviously feels fake.Otherwise, the climatic battle was alright - if pushing the patriotism a bit too far... but hey, the winners write history, so...Well, I give this technically impressive movie a 5\/10 for its achievements in all the tech departments, but as a story it's really lacking good editing - especially a focus on cliches.

I find this a good conflict and a justifiable reason for someone to go to war - as if revenging his family wasn't enough; and this is where the movie starts falling apart. Following the mould of Braveheart and Gladiator, The Patriot is yet another story about a man who goes to war to avenge his dead family at the hands of a tyrant. I don't have a problem with ideas and stories being recycled - where would poor Shakespeare be if everyone thought so? - but The Patriot doesn't pull off this idea with any new innovation or depth or particular panache.The characters are very one-dimensional, although the filmmakers try to compensate this for giving everyone a lot of anger... that's not good enough, I'm sorry. The dialogue is uninspired and uninspiring, really - cliched at best! All the family relationships are played as traditionally, without anything new to look for; the characters react to the others like you expect them to, because you've seen it before thousands times, and you just know what their lines are and how they're going to deliver them. It's really annoying being able to second-guess every next scene.The subplots aren't really great either - for some reason Benjamin falls in love for his dead wife's sister, although that's not really developed in the movie, and that's a good thing - the best, though, would have been to avoid just this cliche. Not every movie needs to be a love story - there was already a potential father\/son relationship to explore, which was underdeveloped, instead - and people will see right through the forced ones. Which leads me to Gabriel and Anne's own love story - okay, I can buy the two love each other, but wasn't their marriage really just a reason for Anne to be killed so Gabriel would try to avenge her in a rash act of stupid bravery and die, so then his father will try and avenge him in the climatic battle. It's not like he wouldn't participate in it if Gabriel had survived, so what's the point of marrying him off in one scene and killing the wife right in the next? It's so rushed and again forced, it obviously feels fake.Otherwise, the climatic battle was alright - if pushing the patriotism a bit too far... but hey, the winners write history, so...Well, I give this technically impressive movie a 5\/10 for its achievements in all the tech departments, but as a story it's really lacking good editing - especially a focus on cliches.

He's a moper, and works at the city morgue, which is where he meets the wild Bill Blazejowski (Michael Keaton), an absolute fun-loving weirdo with a headful of crazy get-rich-quick ideas. Bill wants Chuck to be his partner for his next business venture they're going to run a high class prostitution ring out of the city morgue. The idea sounds stupid, but it is well-meaning in some regards, since these are career prostitutes who've gotten pushed around for too long. Bill and Chuck are going to be their friendly godpimps, and help them be successful, high class hookers. Their clientelle are kind, jolly fellows, and the pimps (Chuck and Bill) are always good to the girls. And they all make a sh*tload of cash. Unfortunately, in trying to create this romantic comedy aspect (Chuck falls in love with Belinda--Shelly Long--who is one of the hookers), it glamorizes prostitution, which is pretty sad and at the same time, pretty stupid.Also, while Chuck and Bill are having their fun, a pimp and his goon (Richard Belzer and Badja Djola)want to know where all of their girls have gone and why, if someone else is running the business, they haven't been given a cut of the profits. They're a dangerous pair (although, they turn out to be pretty wimpy in the end). The movie becomes a combination of the Odd Couple as Bill tries to invovle Chuck in all sorts of his crazy ideas once the prostitution gimmick picks up and becomes quite successful. Chuck, it being part of his nature to always do things safely and not too spontaneously, gradually becomes annoyed with Bill, especially when Bill's ideas start to get him in a whole lot of trouble. Though, in Bill's defense, he does try to help his friend out by trying to get him to stand up for himself and quit being afraid of everything. Henry Winkler and Michael Keaton are terrific here in all of their zany antics. The other half of the movie is something like Irma La Douce in that Belinda is the lovely prostitute that Chuck has fallen for. And, once he does, he doesn't want her hooking anymore. Shelly Long was also quite good in this movie, and a natural, as always. What an underrated actress.Night Shift is a pretty good comedy with a great cast that makes a somewhat stupid story work great.

The animation and backgrounds work quite well, dim grimy dull, which make the few moments when things shine (the fireworks, the bottle floating, the waterfall and lighting when Fievel and the family are reunited) all the more powerful, overall the color is great. Its good to see that IMDb is truly an International Database, and i love that i can read reviews by people who've identified that they are from such places as Pakistan, Jamaica, Argentina, and beyond. As an American Jew myself, the connections to this film are quite obvious and my more recent viewing really gave me a sense of the contribution Steven Spielberg has made in my life, and many other lives about Jews \/ Americans. I enjoy the opportunity to view other's readings of the film, to see how the messages in the film are viewed by people outside America.The film has some obvious political undertones that a child will not necessarily pick up. This is a pretty cool thing \/ kinda sesame street like \/ a subtle education. While Fievel's family is Jewish, not all the mice in the film are, as we meet other immigrant mice who are carrying crosses, etc. What the mice have in common is immigrant status as well as being under the oppression of the Cats (don't say it too loud). Who are the cats? Are the cats just the bullies in any given situation? While the Russian cats that drove Fievel's family from their home in Russia mirrored the Pogroms \/ Nazis \/ Jewish oppressors, Who were the oppressors on the American soil? (is it a direct reflection to a group of oppressors in American in the late 19th century?)In light of current political situations this movie could have many implications \/ readings. Does America still seem to have that silver lining? Are people round the world still singing their own equivalents to The Are No Cats In America? Contrast Fievel with Mickey Mouse himself, a wonderful comparison. Fievel is almost a real person whereas Mickey is more cartoony. Fievel is a child mouse. As children ourselves we can put ourselves in his shoes more easily, (which is why this is a children's movie) his fascination with the fish, and always asking questions, his curiosity, which gets him in trouble, and his ability to dream and somehow stumble through it all still surviving (if not drunk and woosie, green-ish) from it all. (a little detail i enjoy is how, invariably he always winds up in some sort of bubble (the soap bubble, the bottle, the bed in watertower, etc.. where ever he goes he is protected in a bubble home, he is magically kept in this safety bubble, the bubble of being the main character in a major motion picture, of being the focus for millions of children.) ... another trait of Fievel's is his amazing ability to run up a stream of falling debris to which he uses quite often to escape sticky situations. The collective effort of the mice to build the Mouse of Minsk is wonderful and the final product is huge and beautifully grotesque and awesome. I love how it rolls out, bursting through the door of the boarded up museum of the weird. There is something in this, how the solution to the cat problem lies in the pieces of this abandoned museum. How all sorts of knicknacks, falderall, and whatnotknots could be gumbo-ed together to create this Mouse of Minsk monster (an analogy \/ metaphor to the very real-life America itself.)There are also some extremely funny moments in this film, like when Tony Toponi, (Fievels friend and escapee from the sewing sweatshop) first sees and falls head over heels in love with Bridget (our Irish rabble rouser). She is all soapbox-ish and politics and talking about getting rid of the cats, and Tony freezes stiff and falls off the roof... (this falling off the roof i have watched, re-wound and watch again about 10,000 times) i don't know why but it just cracks me up the way his body remains stiff and sort of just slides \/ pops off the roof, and then how he is trying to repeat cats when Bridget sees him and he is the only mouse who has not yet run away, she is happy that they at least have each other, and then these hippy flowers come out of nowhere and it's like a sixties love-in all of a sudden.Also the underground imagery in the sewer is quite accurate and really beautiful.

The mice are real to the humans in the movie, (they see them as real live mice, something to throw a shoe at) somehow us in the audience are different, we are able to see the world at their level, to be able to hear their story. Overall a fun classic movie which has some important messages about collective power, what freedom is and means from an American perspective. An Adventuresome musical with wonderful songs (and sad songs.) A little piece of my childhood as a young American... America, what a place! 8\/10  ","genre":"Animation, Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"5 August 2004","score":"6 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":"  A regular reviewer would get into the heavy details of the plot of Billy Wilder's `Double Indemnity', but I wont, because I feel that a film like this should be viewed by someone who knows practically nothing of the plot, so every scene can be a surprise.  What I will say about the plot, just so you have an idea if you don't already know, is that insurance salesman Neff (Fred MacMurray) and his client Phyllis (Barbara Stanwyck) have a criminal plot to carry out, and claims man Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) is onto them.The movie is a Film-Noir, a terrific B&W genre that died out, I guess, in the early sixties.  Sure, Noirs are still being made today, but those ones are more of a homage to the classic Film-Noirs of the thirties, forties and fifties.  `Double Indemnity' was released in 1944, when Film-Noir was at its prime, with releases like `The Maltese Falcon' right behind it and `The Third Man' just ahead.  To me, `Double Indemnity' is the greatest.It's hard to differentiate Noirs from the regular crime or mystery movies of the past, but I think Roger Ebert said it best in his review for `Out of the Past' `The noir hero is doomed before the story begins -- by fate, rotten luck, or his own flawed character. Crime movies sometimes show good men who go bad. The noir hero is never good, just kidding himself, living in ignorance of his dark side until events demonstrate it to him.'  That character in `Double Indemnity' is Neff, a man who thinks he's carrying out Phyllis' plan because of his love for the woman, but indeed is not.  He likes the plan, he likes doing it, just for the sake of carrying out the evil deed.Phyllis shares his love for the dark, and the evil scheme is the basis of their relationship.  They are never seen talking about anything but the plan, they don't want to, instead of being in love with each other they're in evil with each other.And then there's Keyes, a man who's life has been consumed by his profession so much so that he once dumped his fiancée because he found out about some sketchy business from her past, he says.  But he is a great man, strong willed and smarter than any other man working at his firm, including his boss.  When his boss asks the wrong question he flares into a huge speech about why the question is ludicrous, and why the boss is unfit for his profession.  Sure, he's rambling, but he has the right to, he's the cleverest claims man you'll ever find.So the better part of the movie is about Neff avoiding and out-maneuvering Keyes, a situation which generates such heated suspense, on account of both the actors and Billy Wilder's expert direction and script (co-written by Raymond Chandler).  MacMurray is perfect as the everyman with a dark side, using his     pan expression and voice as an advantage.  Some say Bogart would've been more suited with the role, but Neff is the kind of character that would look and sound tired all the time, just like MacMurray.  Stanwyck shows delicious darkness in an Oscar-nominated role, there's a scene where her face gradually turns from tearful regret to     y evil that sent chills down my spine.And, of course, there is Edward G. Robinson, in a stellar performance, stealing every scene he is in from under Mac Murray (or whomever's) feet.  The role is played with such skill and focus that personally I think it's a travesty he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for it.`Double Indemnity' is the best Film-Noir, a template for perfection, 9\/10.

The camera does not position itself on the sidewalk, or above the flowerbed next to her, or in the window of another room &#150; it stays put.What Hitchcock does here is nothing short of brilliant &#150; the movie turns us into unconscious voyeurs as we are forced to take on the perspective of the protagonist, and participate in his constant eavesdropping.This technique of isolation and confinement forms a sort of disturbing effect that smothers the viewer on a subconscious level &#150; we can feel it, but can't necessarily put a finger on what, exactly, it is.The movie is also particularly risqué for its time &#150; 50 years later it's the sort of film that would probably receive a PG rating (and, in fact, after being restored and re-released in 2000, it did). There is no foul language, no sex, no nudity, no violence (per se), and no drug content. But there are many insinuations &#150; e.g. the mental image Hitchcock forms in his viewers' minds, of the man next door murdering his wife; the innuendo involving Lisa's overnight stay at Jeffries' (and her dress that sparks the interest of a private detective); the newlywed couple next door (No comment, Jeffries tells Lisa); Miss Torso, the ballerina who lives across the street and the amount of time Jeffries spends watching her dance and change out of clothes. Jeffries has injured his leg after trying to take a daring photograph -- now he doesn't have a television or any other means of entertainment, so he amuses himself by studying the lives of others. Sound familiar? With Reality TV shows such as Survivor, Big Brother and Fear Factor, America's growing fascination with voyeuristic programming is becoming rather startling.

Jeffries believes so, and convinces Lisa and Stella, too. They begin to piece together a number of clues &#150; a disheveled flower bed, a purse, fake letters &#150; that lead to one conclusion Murder. The problem is that no one else believes them.A movie such as Rear Window would never work nowadays. The main character would entertain himself with technology &#150; not voyeurism. The windows would not be left open for fear of burglary. Police would be more willing to believe such a far-fetched story, and the private detective probably wouldn't shrug off Jeffries like he does in the film.This is evidenced by the poor remake starring Christopher Reeves, made for television &#150; it didn't make any sense because it was set in this day and age, featuring an outdated concept.

A splash of brilliance before the inevitable passage into death of all living things.Luckily, I read Berendt's book before seeing the film, and realise just how hard Hancock must have worked to translate it to the screen. It is also, in my mind, one of Eastwood's best (if not THE best) directorial outings. The casting is superb. Not a 'clunker' among them. As an evocation of the decline of the contemporary South, I would offer that it is nonpareil lazy, sleazy, desperate at times, yet possessed of a dignity that is long past in the rest-of-the-world. Whilst Savannah is not the Big Easy, as portrayed it has much of its charm, artifice, and implied danger. And there's the rub when becoming engrossed in this garden of smoke and mirrors. It appeals to those of us who can only be outsiders looking in. The inclusion in the screenplay of Kelsoe's love interest (not present in the book) was, for me, an acceptable complication. It juxtaposed the Yankee's at times ingenuous fascination with all around him. His apparent ambivalence toward the sexuality aimed at him by the central characters (Jim and the Lady Chablis are obviously enamoured of him) becomes anchored in his desire to be part of their world but on his terms. Thus the inclusion of a heterosexual relationship which leads to his decision to stay.I would offer, however, that one of the most telling scenes (at least in exploration of Kelsoe's character) is his obvious pride in the 'overpaint' - given to him by Jim - hanging on his newly-acquired wall as he tells his 'love-interest' that he is 'here to stay' for at least six months as he writes his book. It is not the presented landscape itself which intrigues us it is the possibility that something more valuable resides beneath. A mystery left unsolved. Just like Savannah, really. An excellent film. Enjoy it for itself.

So when I just purchased it on DVD, as part of the Naked Gun gift set, the gags weren't as fresh to me. I watched it several times when it appeared on ABC, and since the movie doesn't contain any foul language or overt sexual gags, very little was snipped from the TV version. Needless to say, the reason why this sequel doesn't work as well is because of the absence of David Zucker as director. This time Peter Segal occupies the director's chair. Segal definitely has talent. He's the same director who brought us Tommy Boy, My Fellow Americans and the hilarious Anger Management. But his approach to humor isn't the same as Zucker's. Zucker is better at handling slapstick, while Segal is better at scatological comedy. Though the same writers contributed to this third installment, Segal's a little rusty with the timing and delivery of these gags. And in farce, timing is everything. In the other two films, I found all the gags either funny or hilarious. If I didn't get a belly laugh, I was probably chuckling at least. The Naked Gun 33 1\/3 contains some gags that simply don't work and settle for flat payoffs. But on a positive note, most of the gags do work and the cast still gives their all. It's a shame that O.J. Simpson got involved in murder. He could've made a fine comic actor. I don't exactly visualize him as a leading man, but he would do well in quirky supporting roles like these. Another good thing about the film is Anna-Nicole Smith, who at the time looked absolutely stunning! And though I didn't receive as many belly laughs as I thought, there are a few, like the conclusion at the Oscar ceremony. The sperm bank scene is also hilarious. Unfortunately, the joke is worn out for me, now that I've seen the movie about 5 times. If you're in the mood for a good comedy (though not a great one), The Naked Gun 33 1\/3 delivers. But don't go in expecting too much.

When being written in the 1930-40ies, 'The Lord of the Rings' was far from being considered to ever become a movie, not even a best-selling novel (like 'Harry Potter'). It was intended as a tale, invented by Tolkien for 'personal use'. He created an own, very complex, multi-dimensional fantasy world, which cannot be reduced (and is not be reduced by the movie) to a simple 'action-hero-kills-the-villain-saves-the-world-and-falls-in-love-with-hottie'-story.

But the common bond they share in losing a son brings them both together and gives them something to lean on.I don't wish to give the movie away for those who haven't seen it because it is a good film.  But I must warn you that the sex scenes are a bit gratuitous and display some of the most explicit and intense material I have seen in mainstream cinema.  I have to admit though, it is easy to see how one of those scenes deserved Halle Berry the award for best actress.  Director Marc Forster does a good job in using subtlety and unspoken understanding, especially at the end.  Billy Bob Thorton gives a tremendous performance with the transformation of a cruel and reclusive guy into a person deserving of admiration.  While the idea that losing a child can alter a person and change beliefs they were brought up by, is a bit of a stretch, it still makes for a good ending and movie in general.  7\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"5 August 2004","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  SPOILERSI bought this movie a while ago knowing it was a really great movie and I had some money to burn. After I watched it I just thought, Wow...this is one hell of an original war movie. I was blown away at how well it depicted boot camp and the war. Boot camp I especially enjoyed because it was so fierce. It's not like Stripes or anything where it's comical and people have a good time, it drives people insane!The film is broken up into two different parts. It starts out in a montage of new jarheads (some of which are later revealed as main characters) getting their heads shaved coming into Paris Island. It then flashes to their new drill sargent, Lee Ermey, greeting the new troops. From there they are spiraled into a veritable hell as they are abused, physically and verbally, and whipped into shape for the Marines. The major character here is Private Joker (Matthew Modine) who is a bit of a smartass but kind none-the-less and is forced to help out Pvt. Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) who is drowning in the pressure of the camp. Pyle still can't improve so the sargent decides to punish everyone else when he screws up. This turns into a backlash from the rest of the recruits which changes him. Pyle becomes more reclusive, learning every single rule and becoming a machine. He is finally driven over the edge one night before they are shipped out and commits suicide and kills the sargent in front of Pvt. Joker. The next part is the recruits we've met in Vietnam. After about a 10 or 15 minute period in their base they are sent out to fight. A few minor things happen, they are filmed, a friend of theirs dies, but not anything groundbreaking. Then they are given orders to go to a city to clear it. There the film culminates in an extremely well done and shot sniper attack where most of our soldiers we have met die including one of Joker's best friends, Pvt. Cowboy. This triggers a huge scene where men run in to kill this sniper who they find out is a little girl demanding to be shot to be put out of her misery. The next scene is a recap of events from Joker as they are marching away in the night. THe Micky Mouse Club theme they are singing adds a little bit of humor to it. The movie is R for language, sexuality, and war violence. Most of the language is in the boot camp scene and comes from the sargent's mouth. All of the sexuality is from Vietnamese prostitutes that come on two occasions. The latter of which is more in-depth when they talk about the one's penis being too large and he takes it out to show, we don't see it however. Of course, the war violence comes in the second part, most of which is in the final scene. It nothing too graphic but may disturb some.Overall this movie is a masterpiece.

Before I begin with MY review of Pretty Woman, I have to warn you, I'm biased  This movie is one of my Top Ten Movies of All Time.  Why, you ask?  1)  Julia Roberts in a  star- making role.  2)  Richard Gere, who must've realized somewhere during filming that he was playing second fiddle to a young woman in a star-making role.  3)  Jason Alexander at his smarmiest best.  In his eventual obituary (a LONG time from now, we hope!), they'll probably recap that he once slapped Julia Roberts silly in this movie (I know, HISSSSS!!!). 4)  Laura San Giacomo in yet ANOTHER great supporting role.  5)  Hector Elizondo  (a fixture in movies directed by Garry Marshall) at his all-time scene-stealing finest.  I  love to watch this movie (I've seen it between 50 to 100 times - I know the dialogue by heart) just to see the looks on Elizondo's face when he shares a scene with Roberts.  They run the gamut from reproach to pity to acceptance to admiration and finally to warm  respect.

In Elizondo's final  scene in the movie, he agrees to return a necklace and matching earrings, given to him by Richard Gere, to the store he borrowed them from.

Of course,  he's not talking about the jewelry, he's talking about Julia Roberts who parted company with Gere (reluctantly) the day before.

YOU are partly the reason why this movie is found so funny by others, those with brains and a knowledge of how society works, that is.To make it as basic as possible, this movie is about how hypocritical society is when it comes to bad language.  Society can show wars and porn 24\/7 as entertainment, but you better not say a bad word on TV or radio!  If you didn't realize that about the movie, there's no chance in Saddam's hell that you will find it funny!  And if you didn't realize it, perhaps you should stick to watching 2 Fast 2 Furious!  If you get the point, this movie is beyond hilarious, perhaps the best musical-comedy ever.On a side note, I originally went to see this movie in the theater with a friend who had a brother with mental issues.  I was constantly distracted trying to get him to keep quiet and also continually returning to the candy stand for him.  So when I seen it the 1st time, I didn't understand the plot, and I thought it was horrible too.  I thought it was one of the worst movies ever seen at the time, so I understand where some of the people who hate this movie are coming from....and they are coming from the group who didn't get the point, obviously!
