At the turn of the 90's, slasher films were quickly going out of fashion and the in-thing to do was to kill off your villain. It's a noble idea, especially since the last Nightmare flick from the 80's left a bad taste in just about everyone's mouth. However, if you plan on sending off such an iconic pop-culture figure as Freddy Krueger, shouldn't you do it in a way that respects the fans and leaves them yearning for more? Afterall, that's the game that is played in this genre. Step one tell them it's ending. Step two rake in record box office receipts. Step three resurrect said franchise to quench the thirst of the fan-base. Step four rake in even more dough. Funny, isn't it, that all these years later, this is the last of the 'true' Freddy sequels we have seen? Perhaps that's a testament to the load of crap that is Freddy's Dead. In all fairness, there are aspects to the movie that make it worth watching at least once. As for this fan, well, I'm just too ashamed to admit how many times I've sat through this, though.To her credit, first time director Rachel Talalay (who served as line-producer for the bulk of the franchise) shows some skill behind the camera, but it is the abomination of a script we are served and the execution in which it is delivered that sinks this ship. Bad dialogue is bad enough without bad actors spewing it, but this film has plenty of both to go around. There isn't much of a story to tell, either, as we spend the 90 minutes of the film waiting for Freddy to bite the dust. One thing, however, that this movie has going for it is that it reveals a bit more of Freddy's back-story, as we get to see Robert Englund play the Freddy Krueger that existed before he entered the dream world. But then, points like these are ruined when things like The Dream Demons (who closely resemble a certain reproductive matter) are introduced. Elsewhere, the nightmare sequences -- a trademark of the series as a whole -- are downright stupid, and not to mention, drawn out. Unless you find Looney Tunes, power-gloves (as in Nintendo Power Glove) and The Wizard Of Oz scary, you won't find much of interest here. Granted, after six films, it's hard to make Freddy scary, but they take it to a whole new level of lameness with the cheesy one-liners Freddy spews. Truth be told, he resembles Bugs Bunny more than he resembles a son of a hundred maniacs. And boy, let's not get started on that 3D sequence that closes the film. It's bad enough that Freddy is finished off in a bland, anti-climatic way, but it looks cheesy to boot. The 3D doesn't work, and like ninety-percent of the film, it's a gimmick.Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare is the lowest point in the series, but at least they had the good sense to end it there. I rate it four out of ten, and that's being generous. The back-story is fair, and the cameos from the likes of Roseanne, Alice Cooper and Nightmare alum, Johnny Depp, will grab your attention and most likely render a chuckle. Also, and I have to be honest, the film is visually very appealing and well made. It's just a shame there's virtually nothing below the surface. Watch this movie because it finishes the series and take comfort knowing that it doesn't get any worse than this.

Personally I think the biggest problem I had with The Prophecy was that it spends far too much time on obscure religious themes & ideas which never really pay-off, it tries to take conventional ideas & accepted belief's & twist them around a bit by actually making Angels evil rather than the whiter than white portrayals seen elsewhere but to my eyes Gabriel just looked like an ordinary guy & therefore this distinction was somewhat lost on me & not being religious in the slightest also didn't help me get the most of The Prophecy.

I am not saying The Prophecy is a bad film or that it's not worth watching but I just thought it got bogged down in a lot of unconvincing religious nonsense that I personally found a bit dull.

Robert Mitchum wanders in off a ferry, looking as weary as always, and is immediately suspected by the city's resident American crime boss (Brad Dexter) to be a dangerous detective from the States. Cochran, actually a vagrant fugitive traversing the globe, accepts these accusations without batting an eyelid, thus joining the ranks of film noir innocents who find themselves unwittingly entangled in a messy affair in which they have no rightful business. Meanwhile, Jane Russell, with a spiteful glare that suggests utter contempt for anything that moves, works hard to avoid falling for Cochran; but on whom the sultry singer will ultimately bestow her affection is never in doubt. This film was made purely to bring together its two big stars again, but fortunately it also works as a exotic adventure thriller.According to the opening credits, 'Macao' was directed by Josef von Sternberg. In actuality, producer Howard Hughes dismissed Sternberg before production wrapped up, and so the film was completed by an uncredited Nicholas Ray. Audiences have always loved to see their favourite stars dispatched to exotic locations &#150; however short distance they were required to travel from the studio back-lot &#150; and the obscure Asian peninsula of Macao adds a spark of Oriental charm to an already-outlandish locale. This is a city where dangerous criminals take sanctuary and open seedy gambling joints, where mysterious Asian henchmen kill their victims with knives rather than guns. Normal societal formalities hold no sway here Mitchum gets a luscious kiss out of his leading lady within a minute of their meeting, and, incidentally, she gets his wallet. That the screenplay is completely predictable becomes irrelevant next to the strong characterisations and seedy, mysterious atmosphere. This being my first Sternberg film, I'm unsure of his particular directing style, but the dark foot-chases along the sleazy Macao docks struck me as being characteristic of Nicholas Ray's work.Though Mitchum and Russell carry the film pretty well &#150; and, indeed, are the only reason for the film's existence &#150; an unfortunately-underused supporting cast also does a good job. William Bendix, playing a likable character for once, is a friendly travelling salesman to whom there may be more than meets the eye. Brad Dexter is serviceable as the primary villain, but he's not particularly sinister or intimidating, and his spur-of-the-moment decision to leave the Three-Mile Limit, especially after learning of a plot to capture him, seems utterly contrived. Gloria Grahame (Ray's then-wife, though not for much longer) has a disappointingly-brief role as the villain's shunted lover; early in the film, she and Russell exchange glares than communicate pure mutual contempt. Overall, despite an all-too-familiar storyline, the Oriental-flavoured setting and enjoyable performances make for a film with a fair amount of suspense and intrigue, with just enough laconic humour to keep the story moving along nicely Mitchum himself reportedly wrote a few scenes to bridge the otherwise-muddled screenplay. If this one ever comes up on the TV schedule, it's worth a gander.

If this one ever comes up on the TV schedule, it's worth a gander. ","genre":"Adventure, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"17 October 2008","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" It seems odd for a film noir to be set on a small peninsula off the coast of China, but 'Macao (1952)' nonetheless fits the bill, in a similar vein to Howard Hawks' 'To Have and Have Not (1944).' Robert Mitchum wanders in off a ferry, looking as weary as always, and is immediately suspected by the city's resident American crime boss (Brad Dexter) to be a dangerous detective from the States. Cochran, actually a vagrant fugitive traversing the globe, accepts these accusations without batting an eyelid, thus joining the ranks of film noir innocents who find themselves unwittingly entangled in a messy affair in which they have no rightful business. Meanwhile, Jane Russell, with a spiteful glare that suggests utter contempt for anything that moves, works hard to avoid falling for Cochran; but on whom the sultry singer will ultimately bestow her affection is never in doubt. This film was made purely to bring together its two big stars again, but fortunately it also works as a exotic adventure thriller.According to the opening credits, 'Macao' was directed by Josef von Sternberg. In actuality, producer Howard Hughes dismissed Sternberg before production wrapped up, and so the film was completed by an uncredited Nicholas Ray. Audiences have always loved to see their favourite stars dispatched to exotic locations &#150; however short distance they were required to travel from the studio back-lot &#150; and the obscure Asian peninsula of Macao adds a spark of Oriental charm to an already-outlandish locale. This is a city where dangerous criminals take sanctuary and open seedy gambling joints, where mysterious Asian henchmen kill their victims with knives rather than guns. Normal societal formalities hold no sway here Mitchum gets a luscious kiss out of his leading lady within a minute of their meeting, and, incidentally, she gets his wallet. That the screenplay is completely predictable becomes irrelevant next to the strong characterisations and seedy, mysterious atmosphere. This being my first Sternberg film, I'm unsure of his particular directing style, but the dark foot-chases along the sleazy Macao docks struck me as being characteristic of Nicholas Ray's work.Though Mitchum and Russell carry the film pretty well &#150; and, indeed, are the only reason for the film's existence &#150; an unfortunately-underused supporting cast also does a good job. William Bendix, playing a likable character for once, is a friendly travelling salesman to whom there may be more than meets the eye. Brad Dexter is serviceable as the primary villain, but he's not particularly sinister or intimidating, and his spur-of-the-moment decision to leave the Three-Mile Limit, especially after learning of a plot to capture him, seems utterly contrived.

The perspective on right and wrong is a main theme throughout the film and questions every character's outlooks and morals, even among the good guys. Or more to the point, whether there is, or is not, in fact, a time to kill.Not only does it ask this to the characters in the film, but it asks it to you, the viewer. It makes you ask yourself where you stand. The film raises many important issues in society, and not just among racism, but justice for that matter, and what is right and wrong, both morally and ethically. Of course though, even with all this said, the film is not unbiased. Working off the basis of most movies, there is a definitive good and bad and you know who you're cheering on and who you're not, or at least, who the writer's are and are not. Sometimes this can come across as a little simple-minded, maybe even arrogant, but the film tries its hardest to bring a point from every side. Opinions still rage among characters who are meant to be working with each other, showing the different thought process of individuals.Many see this film as heavily biased, but I can guarantee there are many respectable points brought forward by all the characters, even the bad guys, that will challenge everyone. The white aren't all just black hating hicks and the black aren't all just innocent victims of racism who never inflict any themselves.Moving away from the social aspect of this film, A Time to Kill offers much in the way of acting and writing. Although I usually find Matthew McConaughey uninspiring, his performance as Jake is the best I've ever seen him hold. Jackson is superb and refreshing in a much different role than that of what he seems to be playing recently. Alongside these great performances is Sandra Bullock as aspiring lawyer, Ellen Roark, and Kevin Spacey as big bad wolf District Attorney Rufus Buckley. A Time to Kill is a work that evidences the best all these actors have to offer, or at least, did have to offer once upon a time. It shows of a better time before such actors fell into forgettable flicks such as Fool's Gold and 21.At the end of it all, A Time to Kill is going to conflict with many viewer's personal opinions.

If the film fails, viewers are not only disgruntled because they saw a poor movie, but also because it consumed 180 minutes of their time; time that could have been spent more wisely. Paul Thomas Anderson, fresh off his highly successful BOOGIE NIGHTS, shows that he indeed has the skill to successfully embark upon such a risky venture.Three hours can be quite a long time to spend watching a movie and Anderson manages to keep the viewer interested by not staying in any one scene for more than 5 minutes; that way the story feels like it's actually progressing and not stagnating. Admittedly, the film still starts to lag around the 130-minute mark but Anderson uses a rather unexpected scene to snap viewers back into full and undivided attention.The acting is first-rate with stellar performances by Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore, Jason Robards, and William H. Macy. Cruise in particular produces his finest work since BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY and warrants the Oscar nomination. All 10 or so of the actors involved in the actual ensemble do wonderfully well. Indeed, the key element of an ensemble piece is undoubtedly the overall acting. It should also be noted here that while all 10 actors do not actually interact with each other, they do share a common theme of suffering that is pervasive throughout the film and goes a long way to explaining key elements of the movie.The next key element is the Screenplay, which in this case is simply amazing. The dialogue is excellent, and is one of the more under-rated aspects of this picture. This film ages well and seems to get better each time one sees it. It grows on you, as they say.The Soundtrack is also top-notch and most of the opening 100 minutes or so features some sort of soft background music (with vocals) while the remainder of the film is more score-oriented, save for one critical and debatable scene. The music goes a long way to setting the overall ambiance of the movie.This film is not for everyone, though. If you need fancy flashy nonsensical special effects to keep you interested, your best bet may be to stay away. It is more of a cinematic experience than a movie; one that will spark numerous intellectual debates as each viewer will have different perspectives on the key events of the film.
