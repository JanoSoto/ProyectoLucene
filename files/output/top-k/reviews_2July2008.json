In this one, luminescent skeletons were supposed to sweep through the audience and scare all the girls into the clutches of their hormone-driven dates. Now, maybe that happened in some theatres, but not in mine. Probably our geniuses couldn't get the contraption hooked up right. Anyhow, as I recall, I got a peck on the cheek at the front door and was two dollars poorer, counting the popcorn.But the movie's still a lot of fun, with a good twist ending you can't see coming. Five people are invited to spend the night in a spooky old mansion, and get $10,000 each if they don't die of fright first. Never mind that this old mansion looks like it's out of the 25th century with interiors out of the 17th, or that the jet jockey guest is named Lance Schroder-- ever hear of a fighter pilot named Melvin or Herbert? But who cares since the host is that grand old humbug of horror Vincent Price, at his arched-eyebrow best. Stealing the show, however, is everybody's favorite fall-guy, wide-eyed Elisha Cook Jr. as the constant voice of doom. He's got basically one line to repeat for every occasion-- Guns don't do no good against ghosts. Yeah, right. Probably the easiest paycheck he ever picked up.I'll bet Castle made a bundle on this. It must have cost about 50-bucks to make. The whole thing never leaves a corner sound stage at what must have been Budget studios. But considering all the horny teens of the time, I'll wager this little exploitation flick out-grossed many big prestige films of the day. Okay, it's 50 years later, the special effects look like the stone age, and my last look at teen years was when Ike was president. But, I bet you'll still get a few jolts and have some fun figuring out the neat twist ending. Now, if only I could find that long lost date, maybe I could get a lip-smacker this time.

Praise is all that I can find for it and anything that I or any fan writes about it simply cannot do justice to this tour-de-force of top-class animation and elegant story-telling.Beauty and the Beast marks one of the first and best uses of digital animation for the range of human emotions that it captures. Even today, there is no sequence as memorable as the ballroom sequence where Belle and the Beast dance to the strains of the title tune. Speaking of tunes, no mention of this movie's artistic merits is ever complete without a mention of the songs. The lyrics written by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman are absolutely poetic (Tale as old as time\/Song as old as rhyme) and the voicing of the songs by Angela Lansbury, Celine Dion, Peabo Bryson and others is simply incredible!The two best song sequences in the movie are 'Be My Guest' and 'Tale as old as time'. The script is excellent taking the old but fairly well-known fable and developing it into something modern yet touching and poignant. The new innovations of the scriptwriters to the original story such as putting a feminist touch on Belle, the development of the relationship between Belle and the Beast, the talking cutlery are fully fleshed out and have been integrated into the pace, moving the story forward and never slowing it down. The characters are sharply developed. Belle is a vibrant bookish girl who lives in a world of fairy tales, yet dearly loves her wacky but likable inventor father. Also it is worth mentioning that she is shown to have an individualistic bent of mind who sees the handsome but shallow Gaston for what he is and spurns his advances. She has the spunk to wear the type of clothes and act the way she wants unlike the other dumb village girls.At first she fears the Beast, but when he saves her she appreciates him and finds the prince within the Beast. She is intelligent, compassionate and has a mind of her own. She's also very outspoken and courageous as is evidenced by her opting to take her father's place in the Beast's castle and in her tirade of reason against the Beast when he rebukes her for putting herself into danger by trying to run away from the castle. With her strong personality, she makes a terrific role model for young girls everywhere. Long before Titanic, this was the first successful attempt at female empowerment. The Beast is a fierce ape-like creature whose short temper stems from his frustration at being unable to find true love. Gaston the narcissistic village champion who thinks that brawns are more important than brains is ridiculed by the movie and eventually exposed as its villain. Even minor supporting characters such as the clock, the lamp and the teapot are fleshed out and will enchant both kids and adults alike.I actually started crying during the movie's finale when the Beast dies after the struggle with Gaston and my sorrow was turned into joy when the curse is broken and the Beast gets transformed into a handsome prince. The transformation effects are simply mind-blowing (for a cartoon movie!).Some eighteen years after its release this movie only gets better with time.

This plan goes fine until the kids witness a fortune teller slash prostitute get murdered by the man in the Pat Sajak mask.Tobe Hooper, the director, is a big name in horror. Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Poltergeist are modern classics. I don't claim to be an expert on Hooper -- I've seen only a handful of his work -- but I would rank this near the top of the list. I have read other reviews calling this film, without hesitation, Hooper's best work, and I think they make a strong case. While the least known of the big three Hooper films, it has a timelessness to it that will strike terror in people's hearts forever.Carnivals are scary. From Carnival of Souls to the more recent Dark Ride, the background of a circus can be chilling. Throw in some clowns, carnival barkers and automated robots (dolls that move) and you have the perfect set-up. You don't really need a masked killer to heighten the fear, but Hooper throws one in anyway. If nothing else can be said about this movie, you can say the perfect atmosphere was created for winning film.Beyond that, we have the same old horror standards. Teenagers making out, smoking pot and being stupid. We have a main character -- Amy Harper (Elizabeth Berridge) -- who is quite sexy, although her taste in men needs some adjustment (I'm sorry, but I thought Buzz Klemmet (Cooper Huckabee) was a jerk).

Avildsen (Rocky). Basically Daniel Larusso (Ralph Macchio) and his mother Lucille (Randee Heller) have moved from New Jersey to California because of the mother's new job. At his new school, Daniel gets himself into fights with bullies, mainly because he tries to date Ali Mills (Elisabeth Shue), and he has no fighting experience. The person who may be able to help him defend himself better, or just help him with his little love of karate, is local handyman Mr. Kesuke Miyagi (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita), who used to be a karate trainer. For a while, he just makes him do cleaning and painting, e.g. Wax on, wax off for the car, Daniel then puts these hand and arm movements into use when Miyagi tries to fight. The bullies still bother Daniel though, and a situation arises where Miyagi and other the karate trainer agree to have Daniel and the main bully fight in a karate tournament.

He's not mourning his lost love (one might say he's incapable of it). He's not going to London in search of anything. He's a sociopathic monster.Instead, we get a lonely guy who just wants a hug and who doesn't want to hurt people.No characters are spared.Both Lucy and Mina are turned from virtuous women into, and I'll try to put it delicately, 'women of the night', ready to spread their legs for anyone who happens by so we get a few boob shots.All of the men are turned into idiots at best, vindictive psychopaths bent on destroying Dracula for no particular reason at worst.The part that gets me, though, is the connection to Vlad the Impaler. I, for everything I've read, all of the research I've done, can't fathom feeling sorry for him. It is written that Bram Stoker himself chose Dracula because he was (at the time) fairly obscure, and anyone who *had* heard of him would think I say! That's nasty! Case in point, his most pronounced victory over the Turks was accomplished by seriously freaking them out. He stopped a smaller force and took them, and anyone else he could find, put stakes up their bums (and out their mouths) and made a little forest. As I mentioned, the Turks were *seriously* freaked out.As for his love story, he killed one of his wives, according to legend, by cutting her from snooch to neck to prove she was pregnant with another man's baby. No word on the results. He remarried.That's not much with the movie though.I feel like my largest problem is the creative licenses taken, and the places where it *isn't* taken. OK, I can't avoid spoilers anymore.Every single sex scene in the movie, especially where Dracula is a big werewolf, I could do without. John Harker getting a BJ from the concubines, please.Dracula had, what they call in some circles, his Rape the Dog moment. It was taken straight from the book. It fit with Bram Stoker's version, not with Coppola's he goes out, finds a random baby, and brings it back to feed his concubines. Maybe he doesn't finish it all by himself, but make no mistake. Dracula starts off by eating a baby.On the other hand, when Dracula is climbing down the wall, yes, they say in the book 'he climbed down like a lizard' and that is exactly what Gary Oldman did. I would have, I don't know, added some wind. He just looked like someone crawling on a flat surface. Just because *he* isn't affected by gravity, doesn't mean his massive cloak is the same.What was the deal with the mice on the ceiling? Are they vampire mice? Are they trying to say that the wall climbing wasn't a vampire thing, but because of the liquid John Harker found? This movie felt more like Anne Rice's Dracula. Maybe they're sociopathic killers of the night, but they just want to be loved. Humans are bad for wanting to kill them.If, however, you are halfway sane and have no plans of ever reading either the original book or anything about Vlad the Impaler, you'll love it.

First off what Titanic did only works once and they tapped into it not to mention that James Cameron completely did the research on everything that was true and what was myth. Why Titanics love story works is because its characters were fiction and only they were fictional. Everything else was fact and the fictional characters did not depict what happened that night. James Cameron was very careful with not letting the love story contradict the historical facts. He guided them around it and bouncing off it but never affecting it.

One major problem though was Keanu Reeves. They are also other glaring and not so glaring problems with this movie.The acting was adequate throughout except for of course Keanu Reeves. He was not the only one I was not happy with though. Bridget Fonda did not exactly show off anything special either. She was just there nothing great, nothing to horrible just there. Why does she continue to get roles? Is it her name? Her looks? Her acting ability? That is pretty easy its her name. The only thing does she does share with Henry Fonda, Peter Fonda and Jane Fonda is their name definitely not her acting ability.Then of course there is Keanu Reeves. It is really hard to think of a worse casting move than the casting of Keanu Reeves as Buddha. For action roles or even comedy I do not mind him but for serious roles he is about as bad as you could get. His performance at the beginning I do not have a problem with because Buddha is not yet Buddha he is even less than a narrow minded person. At or towards the end though he is supposed to portray Buddha with depth and meaning, not with superficiality and narrow mindedness. That though is exactly what he does though, he stays an idiot from start to finish. As the movie progresses so does the character of Buddha but not the performance of Keanu. In here he appeared about as selfish and superficial as Buddha was selfless and deep.The directing should be great, after all Bernardo Bertolucci is directing this. Well at times it was spectacular but it was not consistent. Some of the scenes, especially toward the end were great, the sceneries of the Buddhist temples and ceremonies and one particular conversation involving a monk were amazing. It was like watching the Last Emperor again. Then the scenes with Buddha were just horrible and annoying. That part of the story did not seem to get anywhere, they just seemed to go on and on. That is what should have succeeded not failed especially Bertolucci being the director. That is where Bertolucci failed and failed miserably.The cinematography was amazing at times as mentioned before. Certain scenes were done very stylistically and well. It did provide some sort of educational importance which is the one thing I was really with this movie. The editing was also pretty bad, it was one of the reasons why some of those scenes felt like forever to get by and why whenever the story was just becoming engaging it had to jump right back to the story of Buddha. The writing was pretty bad but not completely horrible.. The one scene with the monk was great in terms of writing but other than that nothing really memorable. The way the Buddha story was written really made me determine this was a bad script and brought down most of the movie.This movie should have and could have done better but it did not. Cinematographically wise and directing wise some scenes were down right spectacular and other with Keanu Reeves were just down right horrible. Yet the cinematography was just too amazing even in the story of Buddha that I have to say that this an above average movie. It is a good family movie and a little educational but if you want to watch this alone I would not really recommend it. Very easy on the eyes but just a little to easy on the mind.

When he's not being a cop, which isn't very often, this Lieutenant takes drugs, drinks, steals, abuses suspects, takes advantage of his authority in ways he really shouldn't & racks up some serious gambling debts to the kind of people who will shoot you without even thinking about it if you don't pay up. This guy's life just isn't that great & it's about to get worse before it gets any better...Co-written & directed by Abel Ferrara one has to say that I really can't see where all the praise for Bad Lieutenant comes from, from a personal point of view I just find nothing here to enjoy & for me that's the key as to whether I like a film. I don't want to sit down for over an hour & a half & watch crap like this, I don't want to see scenes of Harvey Keitel naked, or taking hard drugs in a variety of different ways or stealing from the people who he is meant to protect & abuse his power & the trust people put in him. Bad Lieutenant is a pretty downbeat character driven study of Keitel's corrupt cop & his miserable drug addicted existence. To be fair Bad Lieutenant is the sort of film which would put most people to sleep, there's no story to speak of, just a few almost seemingly random & unconnected incidents that Keitel becomes involved in between getting high on drugs & alcohol. Bad Lieutenant has no morals, this is a film populated by lowlifes from start to finish. Oddly Keitel's character goes nameless which one could see as a symbolic film-making gesture as Keitel's bad Lieutenant is no longer the man he once was, he is an empty shell with no name or personality totally taken over by his addiction to drugs & alcohol. His love of baseball & gambling could also be symbolic, since he has no friends the one one thing that he likes & relies on keeps letting him down as his gambling debts mount up & thus add more trouble to his already depressing existence. The film also has a stab at some religious symbolism at the end, once the bad Lieutenant gets down on his knees & ask's for God's help he gets it when he is given the identity of the two rapists on whom he could collect thousands in reward money only for him to let them go free for some odd reason I can't quite figure out. The film has a slow pace, not that much happens, scenes of Keitel shooting up & drinking get old very quickly & the story is very weak as the film solely focuses on Keitel's character much to the detriment of the other's.Although very controversial on it's release there's really not that much here to get upset about apart from the drug taking scenes some of which leave little to the imagination, so much so on it's initial release here in the UK Bad Lieutanant had a couple of minutes cut out although the most recent release was passed uncut since it's not as graphic as many claim it to be. Other than that there's an unpleasant but not overly graphic rape & some full frontal nudity including Keitel himself. The film has a very basic, gritty documentary minimalistic look & feel about it with hardly any music in it as Ferrera lets the ambient sounds of New York provide his soundtrack.Apparently shot in 18 days on location in & around New York the film has a very basic & somewhat unappealing look although I am sure that was entirely deliberate. The one area where Bad Lieutenant scores good points is in the acting department, Keitel is very good in this & puts in a memorable & intense performance while Stella Keitel his real life daughter actually plays his daughter here. Co-writer & co-star Zoë Lund who is seen shooting up on several occasions actually died of drug overdose problems in 1999.Bad Lieutenant is not a fun film but then it was never meant to be, it's a hard to watch drama (hard to watch because it's boring) that I honestly don't understand how anyone could truly enjoy.

The one area where Bad Lieutenant scores good points is in the acting department, Keitel is very good in this & puts in a memorable & intense performance while Stella Keitel his real life daughter actually plays his daughter here. Co-writer & co-star Zoë Lund who is seen shooting up on several occasions actually died of drug overdose problems in 1999.Bad Lieutenant is not a fun film but then it was never meant to be, it's a hard to watch drama (hard to watch because it's boring) that I honestly don't understand how anyone could truly enjoy. There's no entertainment, no action, no laughs, no fun no nothing so again why should anyone watch this film exactly? I have no idea. Set to be remade as Bad Lieutenant Port of Call New Orleans (2009) with Nicolas Cage in the Harvey Keitel role...

The film was released in 2001, however I had not come across it until much later.The film is about John; a lonely, pretty well off bank clerk in his early thirties. John makes the decision to send off for a Russian mail order bride; who arrives in the form of Nadia. At first, John wants to return her. However, after she indulges in his kinky sex fantasies, he starts to warm to her. At this time and during Nadia's birthday party, two of Nadia's Russian cousins show up on Johns door step and after two nights sleeping on his floor, demand more than he had bargained for.The film was promoted either as a tense thriller, a romantic crime drama or even as a comedy\/thriller . I do not know to which category to label Birthday Girl as. The film wasn't very thrilling or very comical and the romance was not exhibited enough. The script became predictable and unsurprising after the first twenty minutes, the tone of the film became uneven and the ending was left narratively incomplete. Birthday Girl tries too hard to be more than your average romantic comedy\/thriller and this is what spoils it.Birthday girl is blessed with its gifted mix of a talented cast. The most outstanding (and best part of the film) coming from the excellently presented Nadia\/Sophia played by Nicole Kidman. Nicole Kidman makes her Russian character believable through remarkable good Russian\/English dialogue and recognisable Russian body language and characteristics. The different elements she gives makes her warm and likable; even though she is a crook and a swindler, you want her to be happy and even fall in love with John as the film strives to an end.The two Russian accomplices ; Yuri and Alexei played by the French actors Vincent Cassel and Mattieu Kassovitz are also well done. Both actors do not over play their characters, they bring an atmosphere to the film clearly and conformingly. Lastly, Ben Chaplin looks relaxed, focused and delivers the comical tone with ease.After watching Birthday Girl, it was not what I expected and the appearance of the film was unforeseen. However, I did enjoy it for what it was and the film did make me smile on more than one occasion. Would I have enjoyed watching Birthday Girl without the superior and very sexy performance by Nicloe Kidman? The answer I think is probable no!

Finally I got the 2005 DVD version and saw the film in its entirety. The movie is about ruthless overbearing Hollywood executive producer and hapless assistants who serves him. It's bit shocking that this sort of thing goes on in that industry, but I've heard that the story is modeled after Joel Silver and since it was written by an insider, I believe some if not all of the story being told here have roots in reality.The movie had very limited showing (few theaters in NY and LA) when it was released in 1995, so most of us probably never seen it in theaters. The 2005 Lions Gate DVD release which this review is based on is very good, as it contains surprising amount of bonus material with comments from the producers, director and the actors, and for us who've never seen it in theaters provides satisfying viewing experience.This movie should be better known as a cult classic, since it is a great movie, and very original in concept. It's a portrayal of underside of Hollywood's movie making industry, and the crassness of the people are depicted with humor (when people take themselves so seriously, you can't help but to laugh at it), but also shows the very real cruelty of people who controls Hollywood. I guess that's the whole point of this movie. The movie hits the point in that it shows how intoxicated people with power will be with their own power, and it may not be as obvious, but a watered down version of this story goes on all over the world in our lives. If it were written in that vein, I think the movie would have had wider appeal and it might have been with the ranks of Taxi Driver and other movies that brought under dog's life to our attention.I hope another version of this movie be made this time not as such personal experience of a single man, but as universal truth about people who have been terrorized by their bosses and the way things are in our world in general.

I'm not a weepy romantic wallflower, but this movie is good stuff.I won't summarize the characters for you, but the 5 or 6 main characters all represent different archetypes of the romantic experience. The acting here is superb. The first appearances by the primary male lead characters, Frederick and Baptiste, are brilliant and hilarious. Baptiste's physical comedy in particular is a riot.The whole film is carried by the acting and dialog. There are a number of violent and sexual moments, but they all happen tastefully off-screen. The writing is so fantastic, replete with hilarious puns, arguments and inspired homages to Shakespearean prose. Seriously, this writing is STRONG. Take notes, fledgling screen-writers! But the tragic elements are emphasized too. The film is full of despicable characters, ironic and painful moments, and wisdom too great for the characters to ever grasp. Even some of the comedic moments have a twist of tragedy to them, with artists who have unwittingly evolved into caricatures of themselves, actors who have become themselves on and off the stage and dreams which are so large they make the person forget to pursue them (if that makes any sense).And how about the layered elements of the tale? The movie opens with curtains to reveal a story about brilliant actors who cannot see the width of the world stage they inhabit outside of their careers. Except it isn't like a post-modernist method of layered presentation because such a method of telling the story is never a focal point. It's simply a nice bonus that leaves you thinking about your own life after the curtains are drawn.Do we love ourselves, other people, or just the feeling of love that other people can evoke from us?
