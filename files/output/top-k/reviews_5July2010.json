AA produced Friendly Persuasuion, Love In the Afternoon, El Cid, 55 Days at Peking, and somehow managed to stay in business though it had no lot to garner rentals, no TV unit to offset the film division. Its movies such as Soldier in the Rain were shot at nearby Paramount. AA did have creative people like Billy Wilder, Gary Cooper, William Wyler, Audrey Hepburn, John Huston, David Niven, Sophia Loren, Steve McQueen, Ava Gardner and even Elvis Presley in its movies. Somehow it was able to stay afloat and entered into one of the first co production deals this one with ABC (before it was acquired by Disney). Cabaret is a brilliant film with kudos to all involved especially Director Bob Fosse and star Liza Minnelli who hit a grand slam home run and won the Oscar in the role of Sally. Liza's performance is almost like a 3D movie, it jumps from the screen! Brilliant!Cabaret was up against The Godfather which won all the major awards save for Liza had it not been, Cabaret would have surely won Best Picture. As for AA, it went on to produce Papillion a major hit with Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman and The Man Who Would Be King, (Co produced with Columbia) with Sean Connery directed by John Huston. One of its final films was Billy Wilder's little seen masterpiece Fedora with William Holden, Henry Fonda. But that time the studio was failing and it could not distribute Fedora as it should have.

What lingers for me, because I play the piano, is Randy Newman's sentimental and delicate score. I noticed in a recent viewing that the editing placed the score in the background, which added subtle texture, whereas in the Pixar films he's done the soundtracks are more aggressively in your face (ears) so to speak. The haunting themes in Avalon I consider to be some of master Randy's finest, with only Awakenings topping the list.I had not realized how much of a family film this was, with no violence or vulgarity anywhere and frankly we don't miss it. The film is filled with nuances of ethnic inflections that capture the mannerisms in which people of that era communicated with each other. Sometimes the body language alone even was more hilarious and important than the actual dialogue.Having grown up in an environment not too far removed from the immigrant Polish Jewish one portrayed, I recognized many family dramas that were so familiar I could pick them out one by one. It is not that families don't eat at table and talk and squabble anymore. It is often the starting point in which they bring their heated conversations to a boil that has changed over the generations. Consider for example the focus on pooling family finances either as a yearly tithe towards favoured charities or the same channelling of resources to sponsor or subsidize the arrival of another relative stuck in Europe. Families today rarely have cause to consider their lives within this framework.The film is honest, charming, funny, sad and warm, by turns nostalgic and also quite descriptive of how European immigrants worked from nothing into (sometimes) very successful living conditions and levels of wealth and affluence. The generation of immigrants (not just Jewish) that fled the turmoils of Europe almost without exception came with very meagre resources. Pushing their children and encouraging their grandchildren to work hard, keep focused and to excel the standards that they lived helped propel the higher levels of success and affluence. All of that drama is given a proper map in this film.There are some very funny scenes in this film, none more touching than the famous turkey scene in which Lou Jacobi's character (and his wife) typically arrive late for a Thanksgiving Dinner, having travelled by car quite a distance, only to find that his younger brother has just cut the turkey. Outraged by this insult to his pride, screaming at his brother that he cut the toikee (accents included) and making a family fuss of huge over reaction, makes for very funny but recognizable stresses that many families I'm sure faced.Another thing that caught my attention is that Levinson almost completely bleached out the reality that these were Polish Jews. You can find maybe one line where someone responds to a sentence with Yiddish phrase, but it is spoken so quickly that unless you are aware of it you'll miss it entirely. No one is depicted going to synagogue or consulting a Rabbi. I find that a bit odd, considering that even if coming to Baltimore in 1914, the Jews were at that point more obviously Jewish, many men still wearing traditional head coverings. The only obvious sign of this being Jewish people are the exaggerated Jewish accents.Watch for very young Elijah Woods who is quite good for a little kid. The real stars give an understated performance, allowing the richness of the story to speak for itself. I love this film and could recommend it to those who need an uplifting family based drama.

Although there were others creating animated feature length films, Disney has always been a household name, known for their experience and ability to create an emotional and entertaining experience out of hand-drawn images, and original, composed music. In 1995, Pixar Animation Studios released Toy Story. While it wasn't the first time that we've seen CGI, or Computer Generated Imagery, it was the first fully CGI film.What a disaster this film could have been. And thank God that it wasn't. If it was, then it would have done more damage to CGI animation than otherwise. The film was distributed by Disney, but created by Pixar. It had no musicals. No frames were hand drawn, everything was done by computer. It had a lot to live up to. Sticking the Disney name on the film meant that audiences expected not a single drop of mediocrity out of it. Thankfully, as we all know, Toy Story was a success.The animation in the film isn't the augmented reality kind. CGI effects aren't added to real life shots, everything is animated. This gives the film some room to breathe. The lighting, surfaces and other effects all look good, in their own context. It would have been a huge step backwards for computer animation if Toy Story didn't come together so well, and successfully put up that fourth wall.But besides the animation, what brings to film to life is the voice- acting, story, and presentation. It's a story about toys who are conscious and self-aware. However, they all follow a strict code, where they do not allow humans to know of their life and intelligence. It's not an epic tale. Two toys are lost and have to get back home. But what carries the film are the characters. Every toy has a distinct personality, and the voice actors are great in their roles. This is one of the strong points in Toy Story.The film's presentation is great, too. It went totally contradictory of what Disney means to people. There are no musicals, but the music, although used sparingly, has a great effect nonetheless. The direction is of the more typical Hollywood style, and different from the typical Disney movie. It is entertaining to exist in the toys' world, and when they venture off a couple of blocks, you feel like you have traveled a long distance. Toy Story could have been such a disaster. If it wasn't for everything coming together so well, especially the animation, characters and voice acting, computer animation would have taken a step backwards. Its greatest strength are the toys. They are amongst the better characters in film.

The series of comedies written by Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond, directed by Wilder and (many of them) starring Jack Lemmon are such neat works of professionalism and congruent talent that during their heyday in the 1960s they provided a guarantee of smoothly intelligent yet undemanding entertainment.Billy Wilder had one of the most apparently laid back directorial styles of his era. He barely moves the camera, and his shots tend last as long as is practical. But within this fixed frame he juggles everything with expertise. He uses the cinemascope ratio to keep various elements on the screen &#x96; for example the camera and microphones which keep stealing into shot as a reminder of the private eyes that are bugging the flat. This idea of keeping things in view without making them centre of attention also applies to Wilder's presentation of comedy. There's a great example where Walter Matthau is on the phone at one edge of the frame, while the rest of the screen reveals the interior of his home. His children skate around while his wife prepares dinner, which culminates in an incidental gag, punctuating the scene, while Matthau's phone conversation remains what the scene is about. This is very much Wilder's way &#x96; not to make the jokes leap out at you but to weave them into the background, noticeable but never forced.Lead man Jack Lemmon was by now a familiar piece of Wilder furniture, and you can see why. He has a slightly exaggerated look, with a duck-like face and a manic way of moving, and yet he can also do normal and convince us that he is an everyman. Still, this time around he is upstaged by an exuberant Walter Matthau. There are many great facets to Matthau's performance &#x96; his sudden overt gestures, his ability to move his hat as if it were part of his body, the way he paces around, managing to get closest to the camera as his voice reaches a bizarre crescendo or his facial expression is at its most absurdly comical. However I think what really makes him fit in here is the way, although he gets all the funniest lines, he doesn't show them off, simply delivering them as if they were the natural thing for his character to say, which of course makes them all the funnier. It's also a lot like Wilder's style of weaving the comedy into the narrative material rather than hammering the jokes home.But what about this narrative material, sharply scripted by Wilder and Diamond? The Fortune Cookie is ostensibly about an insurance scam, but gradually the friendship between Jack Lemmon and the football player who accidentally injured him emerges as the main story arc. It's almost like a love story between two men. I'm not implying anything homoerotic here, simply that the story is structured like a romance with a friendship taking the place of the love angle. The fact that Boom Boom (played by the little-known Ron Rich) is black is not drawn attention to or made an issue of, and this is rather interesting. This picture was made at the height of the civil rights movement, but it is not making an overt point about race, nor is it even a political picture. But it works as a nicely harmonious accompaniment to what was going on in the streets at the time. Wilder comedies could calmly cover areas other pictures couldn't even touch without making a mess.

I kinda, sorta experienced this in a way, being a child of a 70s divorce. But as a kid, I hardly understood it. Hearing my mom lambast my dad for 30 years since has shed enough light on it, but as a film, I dunno.The success of this film ($98 million dollar box-office in 1979!!) and the all the major awards is gobbled up, were definitely a sign of its time. A hot-button issue in the late 70s, of Disco Dads ditching their families for a little extended adolescence on the tiled squares. The only nuance here is that the roles are reversed, and it's dad who's left holding the kid. The wife portrayed here is not a partier, but does go the I need to find myself route and disappears for a year.This was my first problem with the film Streep is barely in it. She bolts for nearly the first hour of the film, not allowing for the title to live up to itself until it's much too late. What follows is a series of vignettes of Hoffman adjusting to the single-dad routine, and the expected chaos it brings. Work-wise, dating-wise, it's all effected. It's during these sequences that Hoffman probably didn't care that Streep was absent, because he's given a tour-de-force playground to carry the film with. Not sure if it was Oscar-worthy, but definitely your typical Hoffman likability.Streep, on the other hand, doesn't work here. When finally glimpsed, she's staring like a stalker through a restaurant window, and of course, shows up later demanding the kid back. Her lawyer's slimeball tactics make her come off worse because we don't really know what *she* was doing in her year away. Which is another direction the film desperately needed to go into. If you want to contrast the breakdown of family and marriage, we need to see a cause, how both parents cope apart, and finally a resolution, to garner a full understanding of both sides. All we know is that Streep went West and got a therapist. Woooooah.As far as Henry is concerned, he wasn't staggering, but he delivered. Again, just like his mother, there are moments where we can't stand him, and he loses our sympathy. Fortunately, by the end of the film, he's come to his father's side and we pull for them as a unit, not just for Hoffman. In typical Hollywood fashion, they go for his waterworks to bleed ours, and it'll be effective for some. It didn't get to me, but that might be a testament to director Benton, for not overdoing it.

Yes, it's melodramatic; yes, there are Langian tricks; yes, the villains are extreme types; yes, there is sentimentality; yes, there is slick over-simplification and distortion of fact &#x96; but it still works powerfully as a tale of innocent people (the Czechs) fighting against a powerful aggressor (the Nazis in the early days of World War Two).If you're going to make a movie about Nazis, it certainly helps if the writers are German, and the story by Lang and Brecht fills that bill. So there is a living, breathing familiarity with the subjects, with significant sections delivered in German, effectively giving non-German- speaking audiences a sense of the alienation the Czechs felt from their occupiers. There are four main Nazi villains, each one of whom leaps off the screen. We start with Hans von Twardowski as Reinhard Heydrich who creates a memorably vicious, almost comically cruel autocrat, the kind of hateful person one wouldn't mind killing. And we don't have long to wait because his assassination is what sets the whole plot in motion. We are then presented with three finely etched Gestapo figures, each horrendous Tonio Selwart, a well- groomed, perfectly tailored, ramrod straight martinet given to chain smoking and examining a large pimple on his cheek while conducting his bloody business; Reinhold Schunzel, flabby faced, gravel voiced and highly strung, who pops his knuckles and slurps tea while interrogating his victims; Alexander Granach, the unshaven, beer guzzling, skirt-chasing Inspector Gruber. And then we have Gene Lockhart, the epitome of small-minded corruption, as Emil Czaka, a businessman who betrays his own people. Walter Brennan is appropriately noble as Prof Novotny, lean and lithe and stoic as he is taken hostage after Heydrich's murder. Even the splendid Dwight Frye shows up briefly but strongly as a Czech hostage.Brecht and Lang are said to have disliked poor Anna Lee, who plays the young daughter of Prof. Novotny. Even if one is unaware of the nasty stresses unfairly imposed upon her during filming, one gets the sense that the weak moments in her performance result as much from the script and direction as from any lack of ability on her part. Brian Donlevy as the hero of sorts, was never a very interesting leading man but there is so much intrigue going on around him that his casting does no harm. Speaking of intrigue, a scheme that is hatched by the Czech underground to trap Czaka is so intricate and masterful (and implausible) that one cannot help but recall the diabolical maneuverings of Lang's 1922 creation, Doktor Mabuse, der Spieler. Hangmen, like much of the silent Mabuse, also has an in-studio look, largely due to the fact that Lang had to work with a skimpy budget. The street scenes are obviously fake but what goes on in those streets is so compelling we are persuaded to ignore their obvious fakery. James Wong Howe's noirish cinematography is a plus under these constrictions.There is no way to know if a better film would have resulted had Brecht prevailed, so we're stuck with what we have an action flick instead of an epic social drama.

No, she didn't she was cast as she is a great actress who was physically right and most believable for the role. Luc Besson is not interested in satisfying horny teenagers, he is making a 'proper' film that has stood the test of time.

After a cool shootout and the murder of a cop she is arrested and sentenced to life in prison. A story is fabricated that she committed suicide and she is given the option by the government to become their assassin or be killed. The whole first part of the movie is very strong, as Nikita develops from a miserable aggressive psycho into a human being again. Her relationship with her mentor is very understated and interesting. She is released into society again after passing her initial 'test' or first assignment. This is the real highlight of the film - a cool shoot out in a restaurant. Once back into society she meets a man and falls in love and basically starts enjoying life with a new perspective and value for her own life and that of others.

Her last assignment is not really gripping enough and I was getting a little bored, however the very end as the two men who fell in love with her meet just after she has gone on the run, is very satisfying and it stops at the right point to leave the viewer with an almost sad feeling.

Her last assignment is not really gripping enough and I was getting a little bored, however the very end as the two men who fell in love with her meet just after she has gone on the run, is very satisfying and it stops at the right point to leave the viewer with an almost sad feeling. I like this film very much, the lead actress is brave, fearless and shows great range. I love the relationship with the mentor and the action is used at the right time. Apart from the end it would have been perfect. 8\/10 ","genre":"Action, Thriller"},{"date":"5 July 2010","score":"","review":" By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. The marvelous cast of Randy N. Welsh this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film.

Then Daryl & his wife Chloe (Garcelle Beauvais) are attacked & saved from being killed by CIA agent Timothy McReady (Gary Grubbs) who says he will protect them, then the next day Daryl finds his assistant dead & in a shoot-out with the killers two NYPD cops are shot & killed for which Daryl is blamed. Daryl has to get out of New York & get to Mexico where McReady & his men are so Daryl swaps identity with a loud mouthed street hustler named Freddy Tiffany (Eddie Griffin) who now must work together to stay alive...Written & directed by George Gallo & based on the novel Across the Bridge by Graham Greene which had already been adapted into a feature film back in 1957 this buddy buddy comedy mismatched partner thriller didn't do anything for me but if you find the idea of two black dudes with opposing personalities arguing a lot funny then maybe Double Take is the film for you. What it boils down to is that I just found Double Take very unfunny, I could see what the script was trying to do & I can see where it was trying to be funny but I thought it pretty much sucked. For a start the Freddy Tiffany character is so annoying it's irritating, his loud mouthed outbursts, bizarre observations, silly clothes & the fact he turns out to be a top FBI agent is just ridiculous. Daryl Chase is more mild mannered & the whole mismatched partners who have to work together against some bad guy's has been done countless times before much more effectively than here, there's little to no believability to any of the character's & the silly slapstick comedy is not funny neither are cute little poodles that bite people. The thriller elements suck too, it's extremely predictable & the amount of pointless twist's it takes during the final twenty minutes is just unnecessary. At just over 80 odd minutes at least it's short & at least it moves along at a fair pace but I found it all very routine & very unfunny with little in the way of action or genuine laughs.As I just said the action is pathetic, there are a couple of dull shoot-outs, a predictable stand-off & a car is blown up but little else. With a PG rating there's no real profanity or violence so it's pretty tame stuff as well. Reasonably well shot Double Take looks alright but there's not much energy here. The script tries to have a stab at racism & elitism, from being treated differently because your black & because you wear an expensive suit Double Take plays on it for both laughs & as social commentary but pretty much fails to make much of an impact with it's messages.With a supposed budget of about $24,000,000 this was filmed in Los Angeles & New York, the one thing that could have saved this was a funny performance by the lead actor's but Orlando Jones seems bored while Eddie Griffin just seems like some buffoon who just happens to be a top FBI agent.Double Take is an unfunny mismatched partner crime comedy thriller that is strictly routine in every sense, a conveyor belt of clichés & ideas thrown together with little in the way of style or originality or humour.
