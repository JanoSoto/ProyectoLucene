Is there a better-acted, more thrilling scene in all of cinema than the one at the end between Mozart and Salieri ?  F.Murray Abraham and Tom Hulse give us a tour de force that has seldom been seen in movies.  \tMost people know the story of Amadeus so it's fruitless going into to many of the films main - plot points.

On the director cut version of the film Peter Shaffer explains that the ending is his favorite scene in the whole movie because it is so unlike any other Hollywood movie.  Here is a climax of a film and it is basically two men composing a piece of music, no explosion, no shootout, and yet it is exciting.   Of coarse the set up and the story of Salieri's mad jealousy are all part why that scene works so well. Many other details of the actual story of Mozart are also fiction yet many other parts of the story are in fact true.   By combining fact and myth Peter Shaffer has created a truly great drama.   This is also a movie that looks and sounds amazing. And although it evokes the 18th century perhaps more authentically than any movie this is also a film that refuses to take itself too seriously.  Milos Forman is a genius for the way he brought this play to the screen.  Another director may have made a dull, overly dramatic piece out of Shaffer's play. Instead he choose to make every part of the story interesting, from his cartoon casting of secondary roles (the Emperor Joseph and his Court), to his giving us whole Operatic Arias, to his casting of virtually unknowns ( Hulse and F.Murray are brilliant ) in the major roles,  Amadeus  is about as good as movies get.

During the last 5 years or something, horror fans have been overwhelmed by shameful and despicable remakes of ancient classics and there are yet a lot more to come. You'd almost forget that, back in the 80's, they were able to do a great job remaking some forgotten favorites. You have - of course - John Carpenter's The Thing, David Cronenberg's The Fly and also this version of The Blob is more than decent. This movie is an update on a personal 50's SciFi classic of mine starring the legendary Steve McQueen.Furthermore, The Blob is typically eighties !!***small spoilers, perhaps *** The popular football-jock, the adorable cheerleader, the outcast rebel saving the day and so on and so on...They're all there ! The story is about a quiet town being brutally disturbed by a huge flashy fluid that fell on earth like a meteor. It appears to eat people completely in order to grow bigger. Just when it seems like the town is totally out of hope, a government service arrives. These science-men were prepared for this to happen and they came to isolate the village. But...are they really there to help them ??? ***end spoilers ***The Blob is a good combination of enjoyable horror ( even a bit of entertaining gore ) and comedy. I say comedy because the evil flubber has some very original ways to kill people from time to time ( ever seen a normal-sized man getting sucked into a discharge ?) Director Chuck Russel ( he's also the only one who was ever able to make a decent Nightmare on Elm Street sequel ) succeeds here in creating a light-headed atmosphere without ruining the creepy plot idea. Also a nice to know detail is that Frank Darabont helped in writing the screenplay. This guy later gained much respect for his movie The Shawshank Redemption. In conclusion, a few words about the acting performances... Kevin Dillon never did many leading roles, but he certainly proves here that he can pull it off. Especially in a smaller production. And Shawnee Smith is a beautiful girl who regretfully never made a big break in Hollywood. She's done quite a few things, but nothing really important. If you like her as well, I suggest you check out the TV-series Becker. She has a lovely part in that series.Favorite rewind-scene  the only really creepy scene is the one in the cinema. Meg wants to get her brother out of there but there's chaos all over the place and, because of the light effects, this becomes a pretty scary scene.

I say comedy because the evil flubber has some very original ways to kill people from time to time ( ever seen a normal-sized man getting sucked into a discharge ?) Director Chuck Russel ( he's also the only one who was ever able to make a decent Nightmare on Elm Street sequel ) succeeds here in creating a light-headed atmosphere without ruining the creepy plot idea.

In conclusion, a few words about the acting performances... Kevin Dillon never did many leading roles, but he certainly proves here that he can pull it off. Especially in a smaller production.

It's hard to pick one, but the shot of Peg looking in her car mirror is a wonderful example of the aesthetics Burton uses throughout the film, mixing bright color with a darkness that is crisp, and not gloomy.Danny Elfman's score for Edward Scissorhands is the best I've ever heard.

Tim Burton makes the right move playing Elfman's music almost non-stop during the movie, and there isn't a false note throughout.Little needs to be said for the cast phenomenal performances by Depp, Ryder, Wiest, Arkin, and Price pull this movie together.As for Kim...she knew that she and Edward could not be together as long as he was outcast.  She couldn't just sneak up there every day after school or something.  And as she said, she'd rather he remembered her the way she was. But the silver lining of the movie is, no matter how long Edward stays up there alone, he is happier than he would have been without his days with Kim.As for the blocks of ice...Edward lives in a house owned by an inventor who created a human being, plus all those cookies and God knows what else.  A big freezer somewhere is not far-fetched.This movie really is about being different, and the functionalism of society.  It goes over the top on purpose--with the house colors and plain lawns, and the shot with all the husbands backing out of their driveways to go to work all at once--to stress that this is just basic American suburbia.

Let me explain this in detail, because I want to be clear about this-- the people who made this film are exceptional artists(especially its late, great cinematographer Conrad L. Hall), and they're certainly not careless people. But in this case, I think they blew it.The very first scene of this film shows a videotape recording of a girl being asked by her boyfriend if she would like him to kill her father. She replies, Yes. Would you? Now, why is this scene there? It is repeated and shown in its full context later, in which the boy later says, somewhat unconvincingly, that he was kidding. But in showing this scene twice, the movie creates a very real expectation in any viewer who is reasonably well-versed in the mechanics of the mystery genre. That's what American Beauty is, ultimately-- it is the story of a murder, and of a murder victim. You can tell a murder story in many ways, but usually they're just variations of the following two plotlines. You can either make the story about finding out who the killer is, or you can make the killer known early, and make the story about hunting that person down. American Beauty sets up the expectation, by repeating that scene, that Lester Burnham, who tells us in the first scene he'll be dead by the end of the movie, will be murdered, and that these two kids will kill him. Part of the intrigue of watching American Beauty after the repeated scene is in learning how much you like both Lester Burnham and his daughter and her boyfriend, and in hoping against hope that the result the movie has promised won't happen. But then, it doesn't. The movie bails out, and pins the crime on the one wholly unsympathetic character in the movie, a character that has little or no dimension until the end and no real motivation to commit the crime he does. American Beauty cheats the audience out of the family tragedy it promised from the very first frame, in order to give us an easy villain to hiss. How am I so certain American Beauty went wrong? In an interview with Creative Screenwriter magazine, screenwriter Alan Ball said that in his original draft, the kids committed the murder, but in the aftermath of several killing sprees by American teenagers, he and the studio thought that was just too hot a button to press in this story, and so they changed the ending. With this film's obvious intelligence and style, I would have liked to have seen it follow through with its intentions, and give us the tough, tragic story it wants to tell. But it doesn't, and thereby, as good as it is in many moments, it fails.
