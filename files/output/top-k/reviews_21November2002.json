Yes I laughed and fairly enjoyed myself but its success has other explanations because if I want to be fair and speaking in cinematic terms, the movie is not so great. The script is thin and can hardly hold the whole film on its shoulders. The characters are one dimensional, nothing more than a caricature, with no development. To be honest the whole thing looks like a exercise that you give for a student during its studies for a degree in cinema. So why or how such a movie has grossed so far around 200 hundred million Dollars? The answer lie in the following elements-1. The movie appeal to a lot of people. You can change the word Greek to Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Jewish or anything you want and it will still be the same movie. What more, anyone who watch the movie can recognize a familiar face. Meaning that characters can be replaced by someone we know. For exampleThe father is just like my father or I have an aunt just like that or I was in a similar wedding. By now you got the idea.2. I believe that this is one of the first movie that set the Greek immigrants as its center stage. We have seen a lot of films about the others ethnic groups, so this is new. That makes the film a more like an anthropological experience than anything else.3. This is quite a conservative film. Yes the heroine break the rules in order to get what she want but yet she choose to get married in the Greek traditional way to satisfy her father(she also convince her fiance to be baptized, to satisfy her father). In the end she confirms the important of cultural heritage and family values. Such a message appeals to the most conservative viewer.4. The fairy-tale element. The whole film is build as a fairy-tale. There is nothing more charming than a fairy-tale, especially if the fairy-tale ends with an happy ending. That was it. You can go to the film. You will probably enjoy it. As I said it is a nice movie.It is not the masterpiece everyone(or almost everyone)makes of it and I think no matter how you look at it it's much overrated.

Renting it will not give enough time to appreciate all this set has to offer.  This is truly one of the best dvd packages I've yet seen. Every part of the set, from the packaging to the extras to the film itself show extreme attention to detail, and is truly remarkable for the package's consumer friendly price.  The picture quality is phenomenal, and justifies splitting the film onto two discs.  But as wonderful to behold the transfer is, the DTS 6.1 soundtrack blows you away.  This has replaced Star Wars Ep. 1 and Gladiator as my show off film for what my system is capable of. Even if you are not in love with the film itself, you should have this set in your library just to show off your audio\/visual home theater setup. Top notch!And for those who love the movie, you're in for a treat.  I can see why some scenes were chosen to be left out, especially some of the shire scenes that give a different feel to one of the lead characters or that became unecessary after the choice to include a prologue in the theatrical version was made.  Some of the restored footage is pure treasure, though--it is amazing how a few seconds here or there flesh out some of the familiar scenes, and how some of the restored scenes add to the storyline and scope of the film.  In the theater these extensions would definately add up to (more) of a sore butt, but they are a pleasure to watch in a home setting, where you can pause at any time.The extras add up to somewhat of an overkill, what with 2 discs full of documentary footage, interviews, and interactive features, not to mention the 4(!) commentary tracks.  Just about everything is covered, but there is some repetition.  One annoyance I had was that in the cast commentary track, they obviously had the actors in the same room together where they were free to interact with each other while they recorded...but sometimes they edit in pieces of interviews found on the extras discs where the actors talk about their fellow actors who were not present during the interview...to kind of a disconcerting effect.  All in all, though, not much to complain about. Hidden features include the theatrical preview of The Two Towers, and MTV's hilarious spoof of the Council of Elrond from the music video awards.I am not going to say the extended version is superior to the theatrical release version, but it is certainly a worthy reinterpretation of the available footage that I enjoyed immensely.

I guess you can read the other´s people´s comments to get a better description of the movie, but that´s the best I can do for now.I can tell you that at first, the overall point of this movie, or so it seemed, is that no matter what you do in life, no matter how successful you become or how happy you may seem when you´re younger, your life is eventually going to suck, and suck hard.  I´m not really a fan of that message.  However, this movie is more about selfishness.  Every character who had a screw loose in this movie (and that´s nearly everybody) got that way because of selfishness.  Their wanting more lead to their downfall. Looking at the movie that way made it a better movie for me.If I were to give this a rating, I would give it 7\/10.

If only George and Martha had retired a wee bit earlier none of this would've happened.  Then, too, why didn't Nick and Honey simply leave, rather than stick around for the full treatment?  Can it be that like attracts like, so much so that they couldn't leave? The final denouement suggests that a new day may be in the offing for poor Martha and George, after the latter has killed off the 'little bugger.'   Although Martha's admittedly still fearful, she clings firmly to George's hand.  Perhaps there's some hope, anyway, for this emotionally spent couple.Edward Albee, taking no small degree of awareness from Tennessee Williams and Harold Pinter, crafted a play that certainly communicated to a goodly number of people.  Personally recalling sitting in its Broadway run, watching Uta Hagen and cast go through their paces, I remember being as impressed with the riotous audience laughter as with the play itself.  The raw lines coming from up-to-then very respectable status characters, namely  college prof and wife, seemed to provide some kind of early 60s liberation from the staid and repressive 50s.  By the time the film was released in '66, the public was ready for its no-holds-barred dialogue.  It ushered in an new era of social upheaval, of which we're still feeling the effects today.   The boozy battle between the hosts, hosts and guests, and guests and guests, paralleled the cultural steam being released during that politically hot period.  The American home drastically changed as a nation experienced more domestic squabbles, separations, divorces, custody battles, and family breakdowns--the last including a noted demise of the traditional family meal.

An intelligent action film filled with well-drawn characters, an unconventional plot structure, and a storyline that required you to pay attention.  Stranger still, it was a James Bond film, a series widely regarded by the mass public as `fluff' when Bond films have actually been among the prime example of properly done plot-motivated action pieces.  The highly underrated `The Living Daylights' comes to mind.But the strangest thing is the critical thrashing `The World Is Not Enough' received.  From Entertainment Weekly singling it out as a reason to overhaul the Bond franchise, to Internet critics (cough Harry Knowles cough) soundly trashing it in long, diatribe-filled electronic pieces.  The fact that Harry praised the previous entry `Tomorrow Never Dies' (or as a friend described it, 12 pages of script and 90 pages of storyboards) as the best entry since `The Spy Who Loved Me' only leads to my conclusion that the critics and movie-goers of today have firmly and finally `checked their brains at the door' so to speak.The range of critiques for TWINE is stunning.  I have read dismissals of the first fifteen minutes as nothing more than one action sequence after another, despite the fact that the opening teaser has direct relevance to the storyline and contains more complex plot structure than the aforementioned previous entry, TND.  Claims of it being `boring' and `dull' were often tossed about.  Even the fact that Bond actually expresses discomfort was singled out as a major flaw.  See my above `brain-checking' comment.  But I am not here to make TWINE look good exclusively in comparison to TND, so here goes.TWINE had me from the start, from Bond's instant realization of the money bomb.  I knew I was in good hands from that point on.  Indeed, in an era of clumsily handled twists and blindingly obvious revelations, the Electra King twist completely threw me.  I had my suspicions, just as James himself wisely did, but I didn't want to believe it.  Again, just like James.  I could go on for a good half-hour about M's shock when she sees exactly what she and MI6 have created in 007.  His cold-bloodedness has never been on bigger display in recent ventures, save a few select moments. (`For England James?  No.  For Me.')  Make no mistake about it.  Bond is first and foremost a trained killer in this outing, firmly focused on carrying out the will of MI6, even at the cost of.The action sequences serve the story for a change, and each carry emotional weight, resulting from character's needs beyond that of eliminating Mister Bond.  Two of the primary sequences are ploys by the main villain, blatant attempts to misdirect rather than outright kill for the sake of killing. Indeed, misdirection and misreading motivations are the primary plot movers. By the end, everything believed by our antagonist neatly shifts into reverse.  And thankfully, the `one-man army' Bond of late is greatly reduced here, pitting Bond against more realistic odds.The small moments count too.  The high-backed chairs at the MI6 briefing. Zukofsky's small moment of delight upon seeing Bond's new Beemer sliced in half.  The expertly placed shot toward Renard's head, blocked by safety glass.  Elektra's emotional breakdown when trapped inside the avalanche (but faked or not?)  And Zukofsy's silent communication to Bond to take care of business for him.  Reverence and respect is held for the series' past, even Bond's marriage is referenced as he dodges Electra's query as to whether he's ever lost someone that he loves.   Heck, these days even a lone `Universal Exports' reference would be considered gold, but the writers of TWINE have obviously done their studying.If TWINE has any weaknesses, the action sequences are not always staged at the series' prime.  Although the raid on Zukovsky's factory is executed beautifully and is a superb set piece for Bond, some clumsy editing and lensing weakens the ski sequence and the climactic fight on board the Victor II sub.  David Arnold's score is under-mixed; giving the movie a bit too much subtlety in moments the grandness should be spilling into the theater (commercial or home).  And of course, Denise Richards is just plainly miscast for the part of Christmas Jones, which screams for someone of greater maturity.  As someone on the Internet said `Bond girls should have class, not be late for it.'  Can't argue much there.In closing, I hope the producers choose to ignore the gnashing of hypocritical teeth and continue on a similar path for the next Bond film. Do not return to a one-set-piece-after-another film.  Have faith (however small) that the audience will wake up.  I know I for one will be there, hoping that the next film will live up to the lofty (if unappreciated) standards of 'The World Is Not Enough'.

Although the raid on Zukovsky's factory is executed beautifully and is a superb set piece for Bond, some clumsy editing and lensing weakens the ski sequence and the climactic fight on board the Victor II sub.  David Arnold's score is under-mixed; giving the movie a bit too much subtlety in moments the grandness should be spilling into the theater (commercial or home).  And of course, Denise Richards is just plainly miscast for the part of Christmas Jones, which screams for someone of greater maturity.  As someone on the Internet said `Bond girls should have class, not be late for it.'  Can't argue much there.In closing, I hope the producers choose to ignore the gnashing of hypocritical teeth and continue on a similar path for the next Bond film. Do not return to a one-set-piece-after-another film.  Have faith (however small) that the audience will wake up.  I know I for one will be there, hoping that the next film will live up to the lofty (if unappreciated) standards of 'The World Is Not Enough'.

These are the same people who like Vinyl Hampton music.What's not to love about this sensitive, off-kilter love story about a young, too-earnest salesman Ted and his sly, disruptive Ugly American cousin-with-issues Fred? Nothing. The film grabs you from their first bickering exchange in Ted's apartment building, and never lets go, not because of fast-paced editing or shiny visuals (though the film doesn't drag and Barcelona at night is a wonder) but because of the clever dialogue. Whit Stillman makes films for people who love to read, yet they are not stilted exercises in Masterpiece Theater-style draftsmanship but laugh-out-loud exchanges of opinion between engaging people who just happen to see the world in sometimes very\/ sometimes slightly different ways. It's like Friends if that cast suddenly grew brains. Give this movie five minutes, and it will suck you in like a vacuum.Ultimately, what grabs me is how the film is so chock full of life, of people who haven't got much of a clue about life winging it and hazarding the consequences. I remember those days. Ted pledges to date only plain or even homely women because he thinks beauty obscures the true essence of love. Fred tells people his cousin is into the Marquis de Sade and leather underwear because he thinks it makes Ted more interesting to the ladies than the Bible-reading goody-goody Ted really is.Actually, Fred may be on to something. It seems to help Ted in meeting his dream woman Montserrat. Ted and Montserrat are an odd couple. He wrestles earnestly with his religion and believes in salesmanship as a means of understanding life, while she is a free-living, free-loving Spaniard who thinks leaving her native land for America will condemn her future children to a life of hamburger-eating zombiedom.I was in Barcelona in 1981 myself and saw first-hand how beautiful and magical the place truly is. I also saw the anti-Americanism and anti-OTANism prevalent there. Stillman isn't overselling the negative attitudes many in Spain and throughout Europe had of the United States during those critical days of the Cold War. It's a good thing they got that out of their system, huh? The movie could have been heavy-handed in this way, but never allows itself to be, not with all those funny ant analogies. Ramon, the left-wing writer who fingers Fred for being a member of the CIA (or the AFL-CIA, as Ramon is convinced the labor union and the intelligence agency are somehow connected), is not stupid or mean, but just like Ted and Fred, a little too caught up in his own ideas of how things are, or as Ted puts it in a moment of truth at the hospital, another person given to filtering reality through his own colossal egotism.Whit Stillman seems to be averaging two films a decade now, and it's a shame. He and Chris Eigeman need to make more movies together. I never get tired of Eigeman's snarky charm, or Stillman's ability to create films equally rich in one-liners and in context. Barcelona was the finest of Stillman's three efforts, with the best story and backdrop, but the earlier Metropolitan was not far behind. Last Days of Disco, the most recent Stillman film, wasn't as good as the first two, but is engaging and absorbing enough on its own terms. If you haven't seen any of them, start with this one.The DVD contains several interesting deleted scenes and an alternative ending which might have made the film a bit darker but wouldn't have disrupted anything essential. Still, it's hard to argue with an ending that has Montserrat bite into an authentic American hamburger and pronounce it incredible. At least unless you're a vegetarian, in which case Fred would probably say that's your problem.
