[{"date":"11 October 2013","score":"","review":" 'Mickey Blue eyes' really does take the mick. It's genre is technically a comedy-thriller but it's worth saying that you will find more thrills watching paint dry. That's not to say it isn't good though ! Actually , some aspects of this movie are very funny indeed and there are some great parts spaced out throughout. Unfortunately, these funny parts are due to Hugh grant's comedy talent alone. The remainder of the cast are typical C-D listers and it really shows. If it wasn't for Hugh grant , this would be getting 2 out of 10 tops. This movie could have been so much better if they had a better supporting cast ! That said, if you enjoy Hugh grant movies, you're probably going to enjoy this one.
