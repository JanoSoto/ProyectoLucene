Not because he was going to give away any plot spoilers (he never does that for any movie unless someone asks, and I made sure not to) but when I asked him what the movie was like, he said it was not just a sex romp but an insightful drama with great writing. He thought it was a great movie.Having just seen it, I'm in complete agreement with him. There is a lot of explicit sex in Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN, but it's not gratuitous or glamorous or inexplicable. The sex and particularly the nudity in this film is woven with considerable finesse into the story that the director, writers and actors really wanted to tell--the story of modern-day Mexico, where the events of Julio, Tenoch, and Luisa aren't overshadowed by the political upheaval and economic earthquakes rumbling through their country, but instead mirror them.The master stroke device in this movie's narrative comes each time the audio suddenly fades to total silence, and allows the narrator to comment on events such as a tragic death or the bittersweet history of Tenoch's nanny. What makes this technique so brilliant is that (to my recollection) it is not applied to anything that the main characters say, except for a crucial fight between Julio and Tenoch. They are the narrators of their own action and only at the end does the narrator look outside them to provide commentary that is incredibly sad but also touching. Not many movies go from very good to outstanding in the final 5 minutes but Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN does.The standout performance here is by Maribel Verdu. The movie works because of her character, her sad history, her understated intelligence (she doesn't think she's as smart as the movie shows her to be) and her rainbow of emotions in dealing with these two horny, unformed, goofy but somehow-likable kids. If she wants a starring career in Hollywood, my guess is it won't take her long to get one.The only weaknesses I can point to are some speechifying that hammer home the film's unabashedly left-wing political views--which are otherwise presented in less-haranguing human terms--and a ridiculous narration that tries to tie this material to 23 pigs (you'll see what I mean!). Besides that, this is a masterpiece. 9\/10. ","genre":null},{"date":"2 June 2003","score":"","review":"  I am very grateful that my brother saw this movie before I did.

It comes out after a great film like Dead Man Walking and the comparisons that were thrown at it were inevitable. Story starts out with a young lawyer named Rick Hayes (Rob Morrow) who with the help of his successful brother John (Peter Gallagher) gets a state appointed job and is given the case of a female death row inmate who is only days away from her execution after 12 years. Hayes goes to the prison to meet Cindy Liggett (Sharon Stone) and what he finds is a very angry and cold person who would rather be executed than get life in prison. Hayes thinks he can make a case with evidence that was not used in her trial but getting Cindy to cooperate is tough. One of the reasons for Hayes working so hard on this case is to prove to his brother that he's a good lawyer and wants to come out of Johns shadow. The film is directed by the terrific Bruce Beresford and technically its a well made film and their is some good use of lighting in certain shots that remind us that some real talent is involved in the making of this picture. But the story just fails and one of the reasons would be of course that it comes out after Dead Man Walking is still very fresh in everyones mind. Also, I'm not one of those persons that think that Stone is a bad actress. I think she's very good but can she carry a film all by herself? For the most part, no!. Especially when the film is at a disadvantage like this one when it desperately needed a major box office draw to save it. Stone is very effective when she's not the center of the story. More than just a character actress, but not by much. The character that Stone portrays in this film is also one that is hard to feel anything for. You don't hate her and you don't root for her either. So the viewer is left with a very hollow film and when its over you can't think of one memorable scene. In a film about the death penalty you would think that their would be plenty of very emotional scenes. But when its over, its hard to think of one. The makers of this film really needed to think hard about what they were getting involved with instead of rushing a product into the theaters to try and capitalize on the success of another film. One thing did stand out for me as I watched this. How short is Rob Morrow? Everyone in the film towers over him, including Stone who is no giant. Wasted effort.

Jean Reno's acting displayed his key to success by being dramatic yet maintaining a sense of masculinity expected by society for a narratives masculine characters.  Gary Oldman is psychotic, a great antagonist who shows that he thinks before he acts. Natalie Portman is wonderful, showing off the talent, potential, and intelligence that she embodies.  Leon's greatest element is the reversal used in the narrative making the hitman an hero and the cops the enemies. the only real problem I have doesn't come from the film, but from what happens to the actors afterward.  Jeno Reno ending up in parts like Rollerball and Natalie Portman acting in star wars.  Not that I have a problem with star wars, yet her acting abilities are seriously restrained for that part.  Leon does have major potential for a sequel which I hear may be in the works but at the same time I can see where it could ruin the narrative if not handled correctly.

But I most strongly recommend it for those thought provoking elements some of which I want to comment on (I apologize if I stray a bit from the simple film summary and rating format).But I found it impossible to watch `Courage Under Fire' without looking at through the lens of the second Gulf War (I saw this film recently on HBO which is re-airing it - probably not by accident). The movie is riveting by itself  - the Gulf War would seem to function as nothing more than an historical backdrop for the dramatic themes explored in the movie.  Still, I am surprised that more recent comments don't even call attention to the latest military action in Iraq.  War movies, even if they are nothing more than action films or just military propaganda, never exist in an historical vacuum.  And as with `Three Kings', it may not be entirely historically accurate, but nonetheless encapsulates aspects of the ambiguity and nature of the war it depicts.  Furthermore, with advent of the second Gulf War you get an even stronger sense that the filmmakers were really on target here. If you haven't seen this movie in a while, I would recommend giving it a second viewing just for this reason.Specifically consider the real ordeal of Pvt. Jessica Lynch who, like the Capt. Walden (Meg Ryan), also happens to be a woman, and is being touted by the Pentagon as a war hero who exhibited extraordinary `courage under fire' (quotes for both movie and real life).  I mean, just look at Jessica Lynch and then think about the apparent `miscasting' of Meg Ryan, a recurrent complaint on this comment board. Were people looking for the stereotypical `butch' character (like Vasquez from `Aliens')?  Ms. Ryan is miscast only if you don't understand that the `butch' female grunt is itself a stereotype that is specifically addressed in the film.Moreover, just as in this movie, the official `story' surrounding the ordeal of the hero is not as straightforward as it seems.  In the case of Pvt. Lynch, for instance, the BBC, through their interviews with the Iraqi doctors and nurses who cared for Lynch, has brought the official rescue story into question.  I'm not claiming that the official story is not true and there is certainly little doubt about the heroism and courage shown by Pvt. Lynch through her ordeal.  But to paraphrase Lt. Col. Serling (Denzel Washington), `not to tell the whole story, the whole truth would be to dishonor her' and her rescuers, no matter how hard the truth is to swallow. The PR games on display in this film - being played out by the White House, by the Pentagon and Army Brass - would appear to be nothing more than a convenient subtext for exploring the human response to the chaos of war. But this movie, I believe, hits on something more than just a remake of Rashomon showing the confusion of war and memory.  At the very least it points to serious problems with the nature of truth in modern warfare, without simply reverting to simple military bashing - that truth, especially the truth of our highest values such as courage, honor, and duty - aren't always black and white.  These themes are never completely developed, nor would you expect them to be - yet in light of recent events (I can't emphasize this enough) this movie certainly deserves a second look.(Also I just have to mention the weird parallelism of Meg Ryan acting along side Matt Damon who played Pvt.

It is not a role I seek willingly; I'd just as soon love his films as I readily embrace many, many others, but I just cannot.There is a compact between viewer and filmmaker. They set certain rules of the world they create. We enter that world in a relaxed, open manner and what we expect is some reward. If the reward is great, we may relax our expectations on how well prepared the artificial world is.Now, viewers can differ on what constitutes that reward. For me, it is not enough to simply exercise a few jingoistic platitudes. Not enough to have no dimensionality of characters; one single, simple unelaborated plot line; one simple moral. But you, dear reader may differ, but this is not the matter of my complaint. The creation of the world behind that important compact is another thing altogether. A central characteristic of film is the vocabulary that is available to quickly transport you to the world of action, the visual shorthand. And for many years, the Western was a serviceable collection of shorthand cues. We knew we were entering an abstract world, one in which good and evil were crisply defined and in which all intents and actions could be discerned to their deepest depths in an instant. The mythical world of the Westerns were embedded in the popular imagination even before film.We don't use Westerns this way any more. That's because we have universally rejected the abject laziness of the filmmaker, the profoundly insulting pandering that goes with reliance on this device. `Fistful of Dollars' of the very next year was made to demolish this ability.

There is no spoon - Spoon BoyIt is the year 2199. The world has been destroyed in a war. Intelligent machines have created the Matrix, a massive computer system representing the world as it was at the end of the twentieth century and the remaining humans are virtual slaves whose only purpose is to power the machinery. The Matrix, the 1999 film by Andy and Larry Wachowski succeeds as both a vastly entertaining science fiction thriller and an inquiry into the subjective nature of reality. The Matrix poses the question, how do we know what is real and what is a dream? The film asks, Have you ever had a dream that you were so sure was real? What if you were unable to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world? Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is a corporate employee by day and a computer hacker named Neo at night. He has spent years trying to track down a mysterious figure named Morpheus, the leader of the freedom fighters (Laurence Fishburne) and one night he receives a message on his computer asking him to follow the white rabbit. Neo follows the white rabbit and is led to an all-night rave where he meets Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), a colleague of Morpheus. Morpheus believes that Neo is The One, a person with special powers who can free mankind from the control of the Matrix. Neo though skeptical, is interested in what the Matrix has to offer and agrees to meet Morpheus. When finally face to face, Morpheus offers Neo a choice, a Blue pill to remain as he is or a red pill to see the true nature of reality. Though still unconvinced, he chooses the Red pill and agrees to be trained aboard a vessel in the hidden city of Zion. As the training continues, their crew is being stalked by law enforcers under the leadership of Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) and by traitors from within their ranks. Gradually Neo comes to understand his role and begins to believe in himself and his destiny. He discovers that he must win the battle inside the Matrix where the agents are supposedly invincible and natural laws are malleable and that he is capable of more than he ever thought possible.The Matrix dazzles our mind with amazing special effects slow motion bullets, glass that explodes like a wave, characters that take incredible jumps, run up the sides of walls, stop bullets in mid flight, and pull off hair-raising stunts. Beyond the style and the trench coats, vinyl dresses, and nighttime sunglasses, however, there is a message. The Matrix, we are told, is the world that has been pulled over our eyes to blind us from the truth. The film suggests that we sleepwalk through our lives, ignore troublesome realities, and base our actions on what we think is reasonable and not on what is possible if we free our minds. In the famous martial arts sequence, reminiscent of Luke's training with Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back, Morpheus tells Neo, Don't think you are, know you are and Don't try to free your mind. Let it go.' It is only when Neo realizes what he is capable of that he can begin to take action. It is gratifying to see filmmakers tackling the subject of what makes us human. However, I feel that ultimately they played it safe, preferring to offer their enlightenment in a package of comic-book stylization and excessive violence to give it the widest commercial appeal. The Matrix is an intelligent film and the directors have correctly let us know that we live in a world where anything is possible, but their failure to show us a way to resolve our conflicts without violence dilutes the power of their message. In addition, by limiting special attributes to one person, The Matrix only tells us part of the truth. What it fails to say is that in our ability to transcend the limitations imposed by our minds and in our power to transform our lives at any moment, we are all The One.
