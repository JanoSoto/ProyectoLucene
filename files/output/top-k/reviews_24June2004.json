We meet John McClane once again, but now he's no longer funny, he's just a pathetic jerk, who you wouldn't pity if he was dying slowly from a horrible disease. He's given a new unlikely partner, much like the two previous films... only this time, it's an obnoxious, annoying, whiny, cowardly, loudmouthed black racist, played by Samuel L. Jackson, who delivers an unbelievably unappealing performance. I know this character was supposed to provide comic relief, but most of the time I just felt like knocking him out, if not for anything else, then at least to shut him and his incessant complaining up. The previous two films had action, shoot-outs, chasing, intensity... this has some lame car-chases and a very, very, very, far too long goose-chase that lasts throughout most of the film. The two characters run around, from one bomb to another, but the audience never really feels any actual intensity, or feels that they are in actual danger, since it's the same thing, constantly, over and over.WARNING! SPOILERS THROUGHOUT THE NEXT PARAGRAPH! DON'T READ THIS UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM!What are we supposed to care about, exactly? The kids, who defy logic and play card games when they've been instructed to follow the cop? Besides, what is there to fear in the movie? Half of the bombs are duds, anyway. And the premise is exactly the same as it was in the first film; Germans who pretend to be terrorist, but who are really just thieves; they kill the guards and put English-talking German thieves in place of them.SPOILERS OVER.The film has two or three actual shootouts, and each of them are horribly filmed, as well as the rest of the film. It looks like it was filmed by a kid with a home-video camera. The action was also dull and uninspired. Almost all of it consists of car-chases, and these are some of the most boring of them. Normally I'm not into car-chases at all, but at least Blues Brothers and The Matrix Reloaded put some effort into it. The humor is pretty much the same as in Die Hard 2; nearly everybody has some lame one-liner, if they're not spouting old clich√©s. The film bases almost all of the action on the long goose-chase, which relies entirely on twists, which means that, at best, you can enjoy watching it once, because the next time you'll know what happens, and you'll just be sitting and staring at the awful camera work. I've seen cheap independent films that are better filmed; honestly. The end is probably the worst cop-out I've ever seen, and definitely the most anti-climactic end ever in an action movie. It's like lighting some very expensive fireworks, only to find out that it's a dud. If you are going to watch this action film, against my best advice, be sure to watch it for free; this is in no way worth spending money on at all. All in all, just a lame excuse to make money off of the Die Hard franchise, without actually paying any kind of respect to the characters or previous films(unless ripping off the formula from the first is considered respectful). I don't recommend this to anyone, since I have no idea how anyone could possible find just a little enjoyment or entertainment value in this cinematic garbage. I don't know... maybe if you have really low standards, zero expectations, and you enjoy looking at big explosions that happen for no particular reason other than to show off pyrotechnics... you could give it a try.

I think this is because of these two main reasons. First, how shall I put this... in the immortal words of famous brat Bart Simpson *annoyed groan* Everyone is a comedian. Every single character that has a speaking part in this film utters, at least once, either a one-liner or a cliche. If a character only has one single line, that will be a one-liner or a cliche. Guess they thought that audience loved the first for the wisecracks(granted, I enjoyed them, but that's because Willis is great at them. I hate it when I hear some random character spout one-liners). Second, this one just took bits of the formula that worked so well for the first, and left more than half out. This time, McClane isn't confined to a building which he is trapped in, trying to rescue hostages. This one has him running around an airport, while the hostages are in planes, where the only threat to them is the limited amount of fuel, which will eventually force them to land. Nothing else. That makes you care too little about the hostages, and pretty much eliminates all the supposed intensity of the situation, apart from the immediate danger that McClane is in, which is a little limited. Also, in the first, McClane seemed more intelligent, cool and calm. This time, he's just running straight into the enemies, shooting constantly. Don't get me wrong, it's entertaining, it's just a little disappointing to us who liked the style of the first. We liked John McClane as he was, and I definitely hoped to see him like that again, instead what I got was Rambo. I also think this has far too many plot holes, especially compared to the first, that was virtually flawless. Okay, now that I'm done ranting, I'll get on with the actual review. The plot is OK, but fairly standard for this type of action film; it's also fairly dull and just barely manages to keep your attention. The intensity of the first is almost completely lost. The acting is about the same, no big surprises here. The humor is pretty lame, in the first it was very balanced, here, it's so plentiful that if I didn't know better, I'd have guessed it was a parody or a comedy. The action is fairly good, less intense than the first, but still pretty good. All in all, as an action film, it's above average, only slightly though, and as a sequel to Die Hard, it is just barely average.

Domenico Scala and Aldo Tonti (who would lens some of Rossellini and Fellini's films) help in envisioning the look of Ossessione, which is usually moving in on a character, then pausing to read as much emotion on their faces, their voices and mannerisms lovely and ugly, sad and dark and romantic. I think I've just scratched the surface on how effective it was that the film itself was moving me along, even as I was in fear of the futures of the two leads. The two leads (Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai) portray all the compelling, truthful, and near-operatic emotions, and the key supporting actors are also without their attributes. It's a brilliant, crushing adaptation, and it points as a striking signpost of what was to come for Visconti in his career.

The first half has two themes  (1)  the developing relationship between Dreyfus and Mason, and (2) Dreyfus's attempt to establish an acting career.  The second half is all about the love story.  Already this comment sounds like a term paper.  Don't bother saying it.  Don't even bother thinking it.The love theme in the first half owes a lot to Simon's classic The Odd Couple and it isn't quite as good because the earlier work had characters who were believable.  I mean, we all know extraordinarily fussy people and we all know careless slobs.  In The Good-Bye Girl, Mason and her daughter are more or less ordinary bourgeoise.  We can believe them, although they're not particularly interesting.  But Dreyfus' character has so many bizarre quirks thrust upon him by the script that he's not much more than a cartoon, and not an especially funny one.  He burns incense, he meditates and chants, he plays guitar in the nude in the middle of the night.  (He ought to have an ugly pet dog too.)  Do you know anybody like that?As in The Odd Couple, two people, he and Mason, begin by irritating one another while forced to live in the same apartment.  As their bond deepens, the story gets cute instead of amusing.  Simon forces common concerns upon them to get them to know one another.  Mason's daughter gets sick (with the flu) and Dreyfus, who likes the girl, sings a tender song to her and accompanies himself on the guitar.  I don't know if anyone tears up in scenes like this but I wince.  The Simon of The Odd Couple would have made chopped liver out of this kind of sentiment.  Oscar Madison had a kid too, who lived in California and who showed up on the phone for one scene that was full of genuine affection and equally genuine sarcasm. At the same time, Dreyfus's career worries, which are dispensed with in the second half, are really laugh-out-loud funny.  The director (Paul Benedict, who is very good here and in other films) wants to turn Richard III into a fairy in an attempt to internalize his infernal warps.  There isn't a hint of this in Shakespeare (who ought to know) or in history either.  Dreyfus is outraged and fights against this interpretation but Benedict prevails and Dreyfus winds up mincing around and lisping onstage while the audience walks out.  The expression on his face after the performance, when Mason tries to comfort him in his dressing room, is irresistable.  If he'd been found crying, it would have spoiled it.  Alas, he later returns to the apartment drunk, which isn't funny per se although the script tries to wring laughs from it.  Drunkeness played a large part in John Ford's comedies but he had the good sense to leave most of it offscreen.As for the second half of the film, which ends happily of course, I wish we'd had a flashback to Dreyfus's onstage performance again -- A laugh, a laugh!  My kingdom for a laugh!  Still it's a good-natured movie, not insulting in any way, just spotty.  The good spots are reason enough to watch it.

Since Adam and Barbara are confined to their old house by the powers of the afterlife, they call upon bio-exorcist Beetle Juice (Michael Keaton) to try to get the new family to move out.

It's certainly one of the most popular. But I have to disagree. Though Burton is a master director and is very stylish, BEETLE JUICE just doesn't sit well with me. It's supposed to be a dark comedy, and it is indeed dark, but I definitely don't find it to be very funny. It's not that the idea of making fun of death offends me or anything (actually, quite the contrary); I just don't find the jokes, for the most part, to be humorous.Also, the special effects are incredibly cheesy by today's standards. The Claymation scenes are almost ridiculous, but add a certain charming campiness to the whole film. Burton does set up many classic imageries, however (i.e., the snake, the faces Adam and Barbara put on to try to scare the family, the entire waiting room and its occupants). And there are a few timelessly classic scenes as well--namely, the wedding, the Day-oh dinner party, and the dancing sequence at the end.The acting is decent.

Plenty of spectacular car crashes, explosions and crazy 70s gang type villains (I always suspect a lot of 1970s villains are just hippies turned bad). It has non-stop action....and the opening scence is the best....worth watching only that part.One of the best action movies ever made and the best car movies made.Loved by motorheads the world over, the series is worshiped in Somalia (a country where the gangs ride around in cars patched together from spare parts and provide the only rule in a world turned to Anarchy...they even write Mad Max References on the side of their cars...called mechanicals), but it is also a vilification of the love of cars and the culture of speed and violence. Remember this is the same director who did The year my voice broke and Lorenzo's oil.One more fact.....many of the bit parts are played by Australian Actors who appeared in children's educational TV shows I used to watch when I was young. When the gangs take over the road....don't forget to look both ways before crossing.

He was shocked by the amount of violence he was seeing. Not the violence of guns and knives, but of cars. The drivers, hoons and police alike seemed to have a death wise.So Dr George Miller gave up his medical career to found Australia's most successful production company, become an internationally acknowledged director and make a little film called Mad Max.Mel Gibson (he looks very young in this movie) plays a bronze. That is a police officer. Society is collapsing, violence and mayhem is everywhere. People don't believe in hero's any more Max, but you and me, we are going to give them back their heros.But Max is sick of the violence on the roads. He finds he is beginning to enjoy the game of death. But he has a wife and child.When they are killed he goes over the edge, taking the last of the V-8s the serves high octane justice.All this was done on a tiny budget.

Jhonny Depp did a great job portraying Raul Duke, he was just as i pictured him when i read the book. Benicio Del Torro played a great role as Dr. Gonzo, although i thought that Gonzo would be a little bit shadier. i would recommend this film to anyone who isn't close minded, and anyone who likes to have a good time. The Criotien collection is the best version. it has many commentaries, and it also has great interviews with Hunter Thompson himself.

What I want is usually the paranormal mystery that needs resolving, and the revelation at the end. I live for the twist. Very few horror movies have actually scared me. I can think of two. Trouble Every Day, with Vincent Gallo and B√©atrice Dalle, made me feel genuinely sick in a way that no other movie has and like I thought none could. The other is Carrie, which made my hair stand on end several times. I mean, I was seriously creeped out.I think that for me it was a combination of DePalma's imagery--Spacek is a truly haunting figure, pure nightmare stuff--and the script. And here's what makes Carrie unique. It is actually a character-driven horror story. It just doesn't not follow the mandatory horror movie formula, but it takes its motivation and narrative momentum from the very realistically depicted inner torment of the protagonist. This had the effect of emotionally grounding the story for me, so that when all hell breaks loose, and the blood-drenched Spacek stares at us with empty eyes, it was the proverbial fist squeezing my guts.Recommended viewing, especially if you are wary of the boring standard-compliant stuff.
