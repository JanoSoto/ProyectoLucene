I don't think the movie quite succeeds on this point. If you look below the surface the typical American stereotypes are even so present.

Instead of being pictured as a person with many sides the emperor is pictured as an althrough evil person. Just like the standard badguy in any standard hollywood action movie. When the emperor cheats by stabbing Maximus with a dagger we are supposed to get the impression that the people view this as a very injust thing to do. I'm not so very sure that the morale of that time really worked that way. Why would the people care about a gladiator? And why would an emperor fight a duel with a slave? That seems just like something an American macho-emperor would do, nothing for a civilized roman if you see my point. Anyway too much of the American culture shows through in this movie in subtile ways. This makes the movie less interesting than it could have been. I guess the American audience will never notice this and maybe thats why it got so many oscars. To me it was entertaining to see once but nothing more than the fantastic scenography and some music in it is worth remembering. All in all it adds up to grade 7 in my opinion.

Utterly lacking in depth and believability, I shed a tear of sorrow over the knowledge that this film had been directed by one of the most talented film makers in Hollywood today, from a screenplay by two of the most talented scribes in the business.  Yes, the film I'm talking about is Hannibal and the power team behind the project of Ridley Scott, David Mamet, and Steven Zaillian.However, can we really blame them for this misfire?  I think the real problem started with the source material, the novel written by Thomas Harris.  The plot already contained problems, problems that even Mamet and Zaillian couldn't write away.  Here's an author so in love with his own creation that he's willing to throw anything on the table for the experience of keeping him alive.  My circle calls this The Jack Ryan Syndrome.For example, FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore in a monotone performance) is willing to go to any lengths to stop Hannibal The Cannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins chewing the scenery, so to speak).  She will even face certain death to stop him by handcuffing herself with him to hold Hannibal until the police arrive.  Why then, after finding out where he is, does she venture to the mansion in an attempt to arrest him on her own?  After all, Lecter is on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List and all she would have to do is tell her supervisor and there would have been a small army of heavily armed law enforcement officials ready to eradicate Lecter from the face of the earth.  A sad fact of this whole thing is that Hannibal Lecter, the murderer mind you, is the most charismatic, interesting character of the whole story.  I found his perverse love for Clarice, a love so deep he not only saves her life but would rather mutilate himself than to hurt her, a very interesting concept.  But I would rather go back to the days when we would root for the hero, no matter how flawed, and hate the villian.And what was with Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta)?  His futile attempts to bed Starling were more reminicent of male attitudes toward women in law enforcement in 1970 than in 2001.    I actually felt bad for Julianne Moore.  Her performance and the look on her face hinted that she was wondering how she got wrapped up in this project in the first place.

Since I don't, I'll leave with the suggestion that only die hard fans of the Lecter\/Starling story apply.

It more than deserves it.   Quaid is excellent as the cocky yet likeable Tuck Pendleton.  Here is a character who has personality to spare and a nice line in putdowns.  You get the sense that he gets as exasperated with Jack as we the audience do.  Quaid can really deliver when given the right material, something that Hollywood provides all too scarcely.  (POSSIBLE SPOILERS HEREON)   Short overacts but is still pretty funny, and anyway, I suppose exaggeration is forgivable given that he's playing a neurotic.  Ryan is cute but in all honesty is not given that much to work with.  It's credit to her talent that she manages to stand out at all.  Mr Igo is a cool villain, but one of many elements in the plot that aren't exploited to their full potential.  The film is so bursting with invention that often things are touched upon and then dropped before they've really been explored.  This all goes to show, however, that the film doesn't stand still for a minute, which can only be a good thing, especially when you have Quaid firing off the wisecracks.   It's fair to say that amidst all the general good fun the special effects aren't always something you notice, but they are superb, especially for '87.  Never once do they undermine the story.  It really is Quaid's film though, personal favourite lines including Dip, Dip, Dip all you like.  Nothin's gonna fit ya and You better, you two-faced sonofab**ch  An absolute blast from start to finish; this really is unfairly overlooked as being 'just another remake of 'Fantastic Voyage', when in reality it compares well with acknowledged classics of the comedy adventure genre such as Back to the Future.

The charitable theory is that people were put off by the title.  MY heart certainly sank when I heard it.  I mean, just say it out loud - The Emperor's New Groove - now how could a good movie POSSIBLY have a title like that?Yet now, I rather like the title.  It fits the story; it doesn't care if it's fashionable or not; it's just so pleasingly RIGHT - but in an almost indescribable way you'll have to watch the film to find out.  Maybe it WAS a marketing mistake.  Who cares?  I never took seriously the charge that Disney's artistic decisions were made by its marketing department, anyway.That was the charitable explanation for why it made considerably less, inflation adjusted, than every other one of Disney's animated features from Beauty and the Beast on, and failed to even get nominated for a Best Picture Oscar in a year in which they had difficulty coming up with half-plausible candidates.  The uncharitable explanation is probably closer to the truth.  People are idiots.  This is a classic - but it's also animated - by pencil on paper rather than finger on keyboard - so who will ever notice?Doubt me?  You won't once you've seen it.  Everyone to speak of who did reports that it's very, very funny, and they're right - and trust me, nothing is ever THIS funny unless it's clever and witty as well.  It goes without saying that their character animation is unmatched in its brilliance and ... I've already used the words humour and wit?  Well, I'll use them again.  In addition there's a charming dottiness that a merely hip film could never quite capture.  Art direction is perfectly judged and consistent throughout, with a pleasing absence of because-we-can computer effects.Here's just ONE example of what I'm talking about.  One side of the emperor's palace consists of this HUGE golden face, and we find out in a funny scene (but they're all funny) that all excess water is drained out through the nostrils.  But that's not all we see.  We see characters crawling out of the nostrils, we see someone dangling like a big booger on a rope out of one of the nostrils - one snot gag after another - yet no explicit camerawork ever draws our attention to them.  Not only do the characters deliver their lines perfectly deadpan, the camera delivers its images perfectly deadpan.  It's just perfect.Two more things I should mention.  Unlike Disney's other recent features, it never, not even for a second, feels as though the story has been unduly compressed - and at 78 minutes it's a trifle shorter than most.Also, despite the constant hilarity, it's rather touching.No movie I've seen in the past six months has filled me with such joy.
