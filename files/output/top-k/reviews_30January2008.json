That fact brings me to finally seeing the 80's classic First Blood. It wears its decade on its sleeve with the acting, broad humor at times, and cheesy credit song It's a Long Road. Despite all that, though, the movie lives up to the hype and fires on all cylinders. I had no clue that the story pitted one Green Beret against a hick town of bigot cops. When I thought Rambo and I had visions of one-man wars versus countries or platoons of soldiers, not civilians out with a vendetta. Rambo just wanted a friend in the world that saw him fight for his country with honor and return home to heckling and protest. All he did overseas was spit on by his return and he became a stereotype drifter, an untouchable to society. The truth of that comes out when a Sheriff in Oregon sees him crossing the street and escorts him out of town, refusing to allow him to even have one meal. He kept pushing and pushing, enough so that Rambo just couldn't take anymore.As far as the premise goes, this one is quite effective. Based off a novel, I can see where the story would be strong despite the subsequent sequels for which I hear are horrible. To have a man beaten, on the brink of giving up on life, find his way back to the horrors he has been trying his hardest to forget is a clich√©d setup for sure, but it is all we need to set this thing in motion. With some nice quick cuts, we are shown the torture he endured in Vietnam juxtaposed with the handling by the local authorities on a trumped up vagrancy charge for looking unclean. They drew first blood and it is up to him to get himself out, with or without taking other people with him. Rambo understands that these people are civilians and decides to only incapacitate them rather than kill all in his wake. These are not the Viet Cong, they are like him, however, they know nothing about what he has gone through in order to allow them to sit back at home feeling free. If nothing else, this film is here to show people that no matter what your views on a war may be, no matter how much one thinks it is not our fight, if our troops are there, they deserve our full support. They are doing a job and a service that we are not willing to do ourselves as we sit and watch TV feeds, shaking our heads that it is all for nothing. If we give even one inch, they will take a mile, you can't lay down, ever. They fight for us and deserve to be treated as heroes.With all that said, can one really condone what John Rambo does in this film? No. Not even his old superior Colonel Trautman, brilliantly portrayed by Richard Creena, can accept what he is doing. He doesn't come in to set his boy free; he arrives to get him into custody so the fight will stop. The private war that has commenced needs to come with consequences. The punishment just needs to fit the crime. Rambo does nothing wrong except to hope for some shred of decency from humanity. That idealism is what causes all the trouble. Sheriff Teasle happens to be the straw that breaks the camel's back and all hell breaks loose. It is a matter of survival at first, but with the unrelenting pace, it soon turns into a search for justice by a warped mind doing the only job he knows how. I laughed when I heard the stats that the character kills just one person in this film. I mean how can Rambo, the ultimate badass, kill just one person? The laugh is on me, though, because I don't even count that one as his, it was the helicopter pilot's fault for jerking the aircraft. Rambo may destroy an entire town, but a cold-blooded murderer he is not&#151;at least not until part two (with the great name of Rambo First Blood II, a dual title that confuses the heck out of people on what the original truly was called).First Blood has become so entrenched in popular culture and the lexicon of cinema that even though I had never seen the film, I could swear I knew Creena's monologue about Rambo verbatim. I'm sure it was parodied multiple times and probably shown at sporting events or something, but I just knew the entire speech&#151;pretty crazy since I had never seen it before. Besides his nice turn during and after that sequence, we get a powerhouse performance from Brian Dennehy as the sheriff. This guy is good and it is too bad he was never used to full potential in the industry. Sure he did a lot of films, but nothing that he stood out from the pack with. As for the star, Sylvester Stallone shows why he was pound for pound the best action star of the 80's. Between this series and Rocky, he was stellar. From the charisma and shy modesty with which he begins the film, searching for his friend, to the stoic killing machine on the warpath, to the broken man unable to believe what has happened to the world around him, Sly runs the gamut effectively and perfectly. By far one of the best action films I've seen, First Blood stands the test of time and delivers on the cult status it holds. Surprisingly, I am now really looking forward to Rambo (part four) and definitely checking it out in a couple of days.

Although age has certainly taken advantage on Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 thriller THE BIRDS, it's still one of the few of these nature goes wild thrillers that manage to keep its momentum and some of its effectiveness. Although the plot of nature turning against mankind seemed dated and became the subject of B-grade drive -in flicks and William Girdler's camping trip horrors, THE BIRDS does keep its credibility as a thriller, and a clever and subtle one at that. The silence and subtleness of the film, featuring the fact that it doesn't have an original score, presents The Master of Suspense's clever ways of obtaining suspense. There are a lot of scenes here that provide some tingle and chills, rather than violence and gore, which is somehow more effective. And, surprisingly, Hitch doesn't spare providing some bits of old-fashioned humor and romance. Hitchcock may be one of the few talents in Hollywood that can successfully fuse low-key comedy and offbeat romance with fear and panic.The first few half of the film (The first attack doesn't occur until later on) was more of a comedy and a mismatched relationship between characters. Mainly, it is about the human characters first, including spoiled city girl Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren's Debut), who flirts with lawyer Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor). Hitchcock continues on with the humorous tone when Melanie does follow Mitch in his summer house in Bodega Bay, with a present of lovebirds intended for Mitch's sister (Veronica Cartwright). Serious thing picks up when poor Melanie gets attacked by a gull, which is later followed by a series of bizarre attacks from the birds on Bodega Bay residence. What caused them to turn against mankind? Is Melanie involved? Is she EVIL? Not even Hitch or the climax will leave you the answer to that.This, I think, is a very underrated work from The Master of Suspense, with much of the complaints coming from the film ending short of what was expected. But I may be only the few ones who actually understand what Hitch is trying to do here. I think the ending may not explain the endless whats? and hows, but satisfaction has nothing to do with it. Hitchcock is not the kind of director who would wanted the film to end with a bang. Hitch wanted to give as the film that would give us the creeps, and successfully gives us one that we'd think about even after it's over.Yes, I give it *****. Although it isn't usually compared with Hitch's other efforts like PSYCHO, REAR WINDOW and VERTIGO, THE BIRDS, without the comparisons, is still a great thriller that manages to create a very competent material in a premise that hardly anyone would believe in. Alongside the said classics, THE BIRDS still remains one of the master's best and most interesting efforts, and still remains one of my favorite Hitchcock movies. Rating ***** out of 5.

Alongside the said classics, THE BIRDS still remains one of the master's best and most interesting efforts, and still remains one of my favorite Hitchcock movies. Rating ***** out of 5.

The first time I saw the film was in the summer of 2006 when I was 18. Since that day Ihave approximately viewed American Psycho 25 to 30 times and every time I see it I am simply more and more mesmerized by this piece of film. I may only be 19 but I have seen my share of great films over the years(i.e. The Godfather, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Sling Blade, etc.) These films that I just mentioned along with a very select few are those rare films that have no flaws whatsoever. American Psycho is one of these films. After viewing a movie I like to think back and review each and every aspect of the film, what could have been better, what scenes could have been cut, etc. I didn't need but more than a few seconds to realize this film was absolutely flawless. American Psycho is hands down the best film I've ever seen.After seeing the movie with a friend of mind, he was also astonished at how brilliant this film was and told me what he heard about the novel by Bret Easton Elis. He heard that in the book there is much more detail and a lot of questions could be answered and there is much more graphic detail than the movie. I then purchased the novel and read it. And like the movie the book opened my eyes to a new world. The novel was quite controversial at the time written in 1991. The brilliance of the whole thing though is the adaptation from novel to film. Obviously some of the detail in the book could never be shown in theaters and was cut for like I said for obvious reasons. But every single character is played to perfection, some of the names are different in the movie thats not uncommon in movie and novel comparisons. The movie to me is the perfect length for what detail is need from the novel. If you haven't seen the movie read the book and I will guarantee that you appreciate the movie more regardless of your current view of the movie.I had actually saw the movie Batman Begins before I had ever seen American Psycho and this was the first film in which I had seen Christian Bale.I viewed the movie and was blown away by Christian Bale's performance as this new aged Batman. So when I had heard about him playing the lead role in American Psycho I was very excited to find out if Bale was as talented as he was in BB. He was even better. I don't think I've ever seen a better performance by an actor in any movie. And after reading the novel it is even more amazing. When reading the Patrick Bateman lines in the novel, I could literally hear Christian Bale's voice in my head. Patrick Bateman is arguably the most complex fictional character every created. Not only is he misunderstood by most around him he also doesn't understand the significance of his own existence and for those who have seen the movie would recognize that you wouldn't even know that he feels this way by the way he acts around others. Patrick Bateman is 27 years old (in the novel he is 26) and works on Wall Street for a company called Pierce and Pierce. The extent of his job is actually not known as we see him just listening to music or watching TV while in his office. I don't want to give too many more details but Bateman his considered a yuppie. Yuppies were considered to be the young , up and coming business men in the '80s. But if you have not seen this movie or not seen Christian Bale you are truly in for a thrill, this is not only in testament to the character Patrick Bateman but to the acting ability and talent of Christian Bale.I have seen this movie at least 25 times and this is what I wish I could see in every film and this is one of the aspects that makes American Psycho so brilliant. It pretty much sucks you in. You can't help but want to know why certain things in the movie happened and you just will not be able to find the answers.Performances by Willem Defoe, Reese Witherspoon, Chloe Sevigny, and Jared Leto are mindbogglingly good. Willem Defoe plays Detective Donald Kimball and is at his absolute best even though he only appears in 3 scenes, those of you who have seen the movie can agree about why his performance is so excellent. Not too many people are huge Reese Witherspoon fans because of some of her recent disappointing roles but her role as Bateman's supposed fianc√© Evelyn is second to none.If you haven't seen American Psycho I suggest buying the DVD as opposed to renting it because you will most likely want to watch it a couple of more times. If you have seen the film I'm sure a lot of you might think I'm over the top by me saying that this is the best film ever made. One thing I forgot to mention is the humorous quality of the movie especially Patrick Bateman. This movie has so many different background stories, questions, and thoughts. But it is so important because of the world Patrick Bateman lives in. But what world does he want to live in? I think you might know the answer if you have seen the film. Hopefully I haven't taken up all your time on this lovely day but this truly is important to all of us as a society. And if you haven't seen it please try everything in your power to see this movie immediately.So if you'll excuse me I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at the Four Seasons in 20 minutes.

If you're expecting a high body count, slam-bang action, and fast-paced editing of the sort spoofed so brilliantly in HOT FUZZ (also featuring TWM star Edward Woodward), you may feel impatient, but chill out and pay attention, and you just might be glad you did.After a puckish opening title screen thanking the people of Summerisle for this privileged insight into their religious practices and for their generous co-operation in the making of this film, Sir Anthony Shaffer's screenplay tells the story of Police Sgt. Neil Howie (Woodward) investigating an anonymous tip begging him to find Rowan Morrison (Geraldine Cowper), a 12-year-old girl living &#151; or is she? &#151; on Summerisle, an island off Scotland that's renowned for its apples and other produce. A staunch Catholic and by-the-book police officer, Sgt. Howie's expectations are confounded from square one. When he arrives via seaplane for an overnight stay, expecting to be served fresh Summerisle apples and veggies, he's surprised to be handed a plateful of turquoise-hued beans from a can. Indeed, all the islanders seem to be eating nothing but canned produce as Summerisle's apple crates lie empty. But that's nothing compared to Howie's outrage as his investigation reveals that the islanders, led by Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee in a performance brimming with urbane mischief and menace) are all free-thinking, free-loving pagans.The culture clash between Howie and the Summerislers lends TWM as much wry humor as mystery and suspense. Things only get weirder, creepier, and often, more titillating as everyone he meets stymies his investigation into Rowan's disappearance. Everybody from Rowan's family to her teacher, Miss Rose (Diane Cilento), to Lord Summerisle himself initially deny that Rowan even exists, then claim she's dead, then&#133;well, with the strange excuses and even stranger rituals on Summerisle, the determined Howie has his work cut out for him as the film reaches its shocking climax.Over the years, fans and critics alike have tried to stuff TWM into the horror and fantasy categories, perhaps because the cast includes Lee and fellow genre movie veterans Ingrid Pitt and Britt Ekland. However, anyone anticipating traditional monsters, copious bloodletting, or F\/X-oriented frights will be disappointed; that's not what TWM is about. For all its suspense, we never see anything supernatural happen; even the weirdest things can be explained by real-world circumstances. There's a bit of low-key gore, but by and large, the monstrousness is of a purely human variety, the evil and intolerance that lives and lurks quietly like a sleeper cell in people's hearts, minds, and belief systems. To me, that's scarier than any supernatural creature, because it hits closer to home.TWM creates an air of unworldly unease, of events beyond what we can see and hear, keeping us guessing to the end. Between the uniformly fine acting, Robin Hardy's skillful direction, and Shaffer's slyly sinister script, TWM is a great example of how you don't need endless gore and sadism to chill an audience to the bone, just suspense crafted from atmospheric direction, a stellar cast, and foreboding arising from the enigmatic circumstances, character development, and a location whose beauty hides its treachery.Shaffer's script plays fair, trusting the audience to keep up with its skillful combination of wit, mystery, and dread. The characterizations are fascinating throughout, particularly with Sgt. Howie and Lord Summerisle. My husband and I have joked more than once that, in the end, what really killed poor, well-meaning, stalwart Sgt. Howie was the stick up his ass. Even before he realized he'd been tricked, that he and not Rowan was the intended blood sacrifice that the Summerislers hoped would appease their ancient gods and jump-start their crops, Howie showed nothing but hostility and intolerance towards the placid islanders' religious practices. If he'd only loosened up and let himself be seduced by the bewitching Willow McGregor, he'd have lost his virginity, rendered himself useless as a blood sacrifice, and saved his own life. God and Howie's fianc√©e would've forgiven him, I'm sure. -) I'll admit that as much as I love the film as is, there's always a part of me that wishes they could have had one last shot set one year later, showing whether Summerisle had their hoped-for bumper crop or, perhaps, showing Lord Summerisle himself being dragged into the wicker man and set aflame after another disastrous barren year. Yeah, I guess it's better to keep the audience guessing, but closure has its merits, too.Paul Giovanni's haunting music, with traditional Celtic songs woven throughout, is practically another character in the film, by turns erotic and beautiful, bawdy and joyful, fitting the film's tone perfectly. No wonder Eli Roth used Willow's Song in a key scene in HOSTEL! As Willow, Ekland looks luscious and does a decent Scots accent, though her singing is dubbed by Annie Ross, and some shots of her backside were done by a body double.

But that's nothing compared to Howie's outrage as his investigation reveals that the islanders, led by Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee in a performance brimming with urbane mischief and menace) are all free-thinking, free-loving pagans.The culture clash between Howie and the Summerislers lends TWM as much wry humor as mystery and suspense. Things only get weirder, creepier, and often, more titillating as everyone he meets stymies his investigation into Rowan's disappearance. Everybody from Rowan's family to her teacher, Miss Rose (Diane Cilento), to Lord Summerisle himself initially deny that Rowan even exists, then claim she's dead, then&#133;well, with the strange excuses and even stranger rituals on Summerisle, the determined Howie has his work cut out for him as the film reaches its shocking climax.Over the years, fans and critics alike have tried to stuff TWM into the horror and fantasy categories, perhaps because the cast includes Lee and fellow genre movie veterans Ingrid Pitt and Britt Ekland. However, anyone anticipating traditional monsters, copious bloodletting, or F\/X-oriented frights will be disappointed; that's not what TWM is about. For all its suspense, we never see anything supernatural happen; even the weirdest things can be explained by real-world circumstances. There's a bit of low-key gore, but by and large, the monstrousness is of a purely human variety, the evil and intolerance that lives and lurks quietly like a sleeper cell in people's hearts, minds, and belief systems. To me, that's scarier than any supernatural creature, because it hits closer to home.TWM creates an air of unworldly unease, of events beyond what we can see and hear, keeping us guessing to the end. Between the uniformly fine acting, Robin Hardy's skillful direction, and Shaffer's slyly sinister script, TWM is a great example of how you don't need endless gore and sadism to chill an audience to the bone, just suspense crafted from atmospheric direction, a stellar cast, and foreboding arising from the enigmatic circumstances, character development, and a location whose beauty hides its treachery.Shaffer's script plays fair, trusting the audience to keep up with its skillful combination of wit, mystery, and dread. The characterizations are fascinating throughout, particularly with Sgt. Howie and Lord Summerisle. My husband and I have joked more than once that, in the end, what really killed poor, well-meaning, stalwart Sgt. Howie was the stick up his ass. Even before he realized he'd been tricked, that he and not Rowan was the intended blood sacrifice that the Summerislers hoped would appease their ancient gods and jump-start their crops, Howie showed nothing but hostility and intolerance towards the placid islanders' religious practices. If he'd only loosened up and let himself be seduced by the bewitching Willow McGregor, he'd have lost his virginity, rendered himself useless as a blood sacrifice, and saved his own life. God and Howie's fianc√©e would've forgiven him, I'm sure. -) I'll admit that as much as I love the film as is, there's always a part of me that wishes they could have had one last shot set one year later, showing whether Summerisle had their hoped-for bumper crop or, perhaps, showing Lord Summerisle himself being dragged into the wicker man and set aflame after another disastrous barren year. Yeah, I guess it's better to keep the audience guessing, but closure has its merits, too.Paul Giovanni's haunting music, with traditional Celtic songs woven throughout, is practically another character in the film, by turns erotic and beautiful, bawdy and joyful, fitting the film's tone perfectly. No wonder Eli Roth used Willow's Song in a key scene in HOSTEL! As Willow, Ekland looks luscious and does a decent Scots accent, though her singing is dubbed by Annie Ross, and some shots of her backside were done by a body double. But why quibble when there's such a powerful erotic charge to watching Willow drive poor Howie nearly mad by, well, making love to the wall separating her room from his? Say what you will about pagans, they know how to party! -) The DVD's extras include the restored version and a terrific commentary track on Disc 2, with moderator Mark Kermode interviewing Hardy, Lee, and Woodward, exchanging entertaining stories about the tricks involved in making a low-budget, tight-scheduled movie while studio British Lion was on the slippery slope to bankruptcy. Disc 1's excellent documentary featurette, The Wicker Man Enigma, includes interviews with Woodward, Lee, Pitt, Hardy, Shaffer, and Roger Corman, as well as the jaw-dropping story of the idiots who thought they were putting the TWM negative in a vault but instead put it in a waste pile that was buried under England's M3 highway!

Not saying that these movies are bad (they are actually quite brilliant) they were made famous because of the publicity and the abilities these films had in the time. Star Wars started the sci-fi age, The Godfather made people interested in the secret society of the Mafia and Lord of the Rings brought life into the fantasy genre again. But what really made these sublime films so popular was the publicity and the fantastic special effects which costed certain amounts of money. In 1994 Frank Darabont decided to have a go on one of Stephen King's novels, not knowing what would happen. They made a film that is honest and that contains (on the contrary to Star Wars etc.) a vital lesson, a meaning and a message to all who watch it.This movie is redefining cinema. No explosions. No heart-stopping excitement. No, it's pure poetry, music and sublime acting. The overwhelming and intriguing story introduces banker Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) who was falsely convicted for a double life sentence in the heavily guarded establishment of Shawshank Prison. His life must go on and he makes friends with other inmates like Red (wonderfully acted out by Morgan Freeman) and Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore brings tears to your eyes). Warden Norton (played immensely evil by Bob Gunton) and Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown) don't make Andy's life comfortable in the prison, but with Andy's unique skills he manages to win their attention and gratitude.This film has some terrific moments like the helicopter shot over the Shawshank Prison and the stunningly beautiful scene where Andy locks himself up in the Warden's office and plays Mozart to all the inmates. Morgan Freeman's raw voice makes this moment more powerful than any other moment in any other movie I ever saw. At the release of the film, people criticised the film harshly and wasn't a big hit, certainly not at the box-office. But when the film appeared in the stores it became an enormous hit. And until this day, for over 4-5 years now I believe, it stands on the second place in the top 250, one place away from The Godfather.This is a film you have to see once in your life!

I wouldn't call it a classic for the reason that the plot makes it all too easy for Trotter. While you do share the excitement as the horses race, you never really get the feeling that Trotter's fate is in jeopardy, or that there is much sense of crisis - Teri Garr threatens divorce but immediately takes it back, the villains are nothing but cream puffs, everybody thinks Trotter's a hero. They even make it clear before the last race I'm covered - you can't put a price on a day like that, so the ultimate outcome is slightly irrelevant. It's also too easy for him to break his promise to stop gambling at the beginning; he doesn't feel guilty, he doesn't worry about it, his confidence is never shaken. It's not clear whether his 'good' day is a reward for being honest, his luck just 'happens'. This takes the film into the realm of fantasy wish-fulfilment, as though it was a sort of chick flick for guys. Nothing wrong with that, because the good humour is sincere enough. It doesn't become trite, anyway. I'd say it was fine for little kids apart from the f-bombs and the dubious message that gamblers win in the end, but it looks like they had fun making it.

The racetrack setting is reminiscent of the genre, too. Teri Garr is especially good as the long suffering gambler's wife, and Robbie Coltrane enjoys himself as the window clerk, (funny, but his stock American accent slips a lot!). I wouldn't call it a classic for the reason that the plot makes it all too easy for Trotter. While you do share the excitement as the horses race, you never really get the feeling that Trotter's fate is in jeopardy, or that there is much sense of crisis - Teri Garr threatens divorce but immediately takes it back, the villains are nothing but cream puffs, everybody thinks Trotter's a hero. They even make it clear before the last race I'm covered - you can't put a price on a day like that, so the ultimate outcome is slightly irrelevant. It's also too easy for him to break his promise to stop gambling at the beginning; he doesn't feel guilty, he doesn't worry about it, his confidence is never shaken. It's not clear whether his 'good' day is a reward for being honest, his luck just 'happens'.

It's a throwback to action serials from the 1930's, and it has a certain timeless feel, something that most 80's movies don't have. But a lot of credit has to go to Harrison Ford for portraying a flawed hero who got by by the skin of his teeth. He also has Ophidiophobia, a fear of snakes, which makes the snake pit scene all the more suspenseful yet humorous at the same time. Indiana Jones has become one of the most iconic film heroes of our time. There's always something appealing about treasure hunters, I guess because we want to be them, but the kind of treasures Indiana Jones goes after are more rare than just treasure chests filled with gold. One of the reasons Raiders works better than its sequels is its treasure hunt plot. It drives the story completely and is not obscured by any other element. The Ark of the Covenant is surrounded by an aura of mystery and danger that the other artifacts didn't have. The actual hunt for the Ark is fascinating too. The map room scene is one of my favorite sequences in the film. A lot of credit has to go to the supporting cast. Karen Allen portrays Marion Ravenwood, an old girlfriend from Indy's past. Even though her character is uneven (she goes from tough tomboy to damsel in distress a lot), she is still the strongest love interest in the series. She had a personality that was compatible with Jones, and the love story in Raiders is really the only believable one in the series. Sallah, played by John Rhys Davies, is just a really funny character. Asps. Very dangerous. You go first. Paul Freeman is Jones' main rival, Belloq, who does not really emerge as a particularly memorable character but he still delivers a fine performance. Ronald Lacey's character Toht is probably the most memorable villain in Raiders, because he's just so creepy.The action of course is top notch. I love the old fashioned sound effects, especially the guns, the explosions, the punching sounds, and of course, the whip! Everybody remembers the giant boulder sequence, but there are plenty of other scenes that are even more exciting. The truck chase is the best action sequence in the film. Indy hijacks the truck with the Ark in a scene reminiscent of the finale of Stagecoach and has to fight off all of the Nazi escorts. The Ark has an excellent payoff scene too. After hearing so much about the Ark's power, we are shown just what it can do in a jaw dropping moment that almost earned the movie an R rating. This movie was almost not made at all, even with Steven Spielberg and George Lucas' names attached to the project. Spielberg had just made 1941, probably his biggest flop, but I still find it amazing that the script was turned down by so many studios. Michael Eisner from Paramount recognized the movie's brilliance and said OK. Star Wars made Harrison Ford a bankable actor, but Raiders of the Lost Ark solidified his image as an action mega star. Indiana Jones is the character he is most identified with. Just think, Tom Selleck was nearly cast in the role. I wonder if the character would have been as memorable with him.

DiCola managed to capture the essence of Rocky, i.e. overcoming one's fears, fighting against the odds, perseverance in the face of adversity etc. I'm referring especially to Training Montage and Heart's on Fire (wonderfully sung by John Cafferty) more than any other piece of music I've heard in my life, Vince DiCola's tunes are incredibly inspiring, unbelievably motivating...

I acknowledge that the first time I saw Rocky IV, I hated Vince DiCola's music because it was so different from Bill Conti's, but after watching the movie again, I came to adore it. In 1985, it was a score ahead of its time, and more than twenty years later, it still is. It hasn't lost an ounce of its power. Is it humanly possible to compose a more motivating soundtrack?

I haven't read all of the book (there's still some time, hopefully, before I die to get it all in), but from just skimming the surface it is legitimately great literature, a kind of simple-yet-profound sense of the essential flaw of human ambition, and of the horrors with a wrath of God in the form of a vengeful sea captain. It might not be the easiest read- and some of it's authentic 19th century language has been brought over to the screen without much change (lots of 'ye's and such). But it is a bona-fide classic for all times, and John Huston doesn't disappoint even as he crams in the film for a two-hour Hollywoodized treatment. His film of Melville contains the God-fearing and God-abiding that is brought into question, making it a lot like a very powerful modern religious parable as much as an adventure picture- without making it seem preachy. It's a handsome epic, with a punch of a ride for its last half hour, and a helluva crazy, determined force to be reckoned with at its center (not talking about the whale, of course, the captain Ahab).And there's the wonderful characterizations Huston and Bradbury capture so well. From Queequeg, with his tattooed body and placid face and cannibalistic tendencies (he sells his heads, after all, before going on the ship with Ishmael), as played by Friedrich Ledebur with a quiet level of enthusiasm and a deep sorrow when he realizes he will die and makes up his coffin. To Starbuck, the one sane character on the ship, who will abide by God's bidding- which is to do the whaling that they've been placed by God to do- and tries his best to have order with his one-track-minded Captain. To the host of supporting characters by Stubb and Peleg. And of course Ishmael, who, by default as the observer of all things on the ship, stays a lot of the time in the background with his narration reflecting his wide-eyed view of this new way of life he's apart of and the realization he faces when there's no going back (Baseheart might be the only so-so actor in the picture, doing what he can to make him a believable presence, though I pictured someone younger in the part).But none is more amazing than the big Captain himself. Gregory Peck was thought as being a little not right for the part of Ahab, that a star who's played many a good hero plays this ultimate bad-ass, one of the quintessential figures of self-destruction manifested by the scars he carries and makes his marks to face off against the white whale. Peck fits in it, somehow, as such a force, who gives him soul when there shouldn't be any, and just those touches of conflict that get brushed away from completing his doomed quest (watch his face when they come across the other ship, where the captain's children have died, and Ahab just freezes up and leaves them to go on with the hunt). It's hard for an actor, especially of Peck's talents of focusing all of the energy and humanity (however in this case soured) in the eyes, to not soak up a character like Ahab. He's a symbol as much as a hero-turned-bad. He leads those under him right into the path of the big beast, who takes away their (possible) God given choice for his own determination. Killing the whale, for Ahab, is like killing a part of himself, what's underneath the mash which he can't stand. Allegory? Why not?It's such rich material that it would need a director like Huston to pull it off. And while I'm sure there would be detractors for a film that didn't contain all of the scope of the novel, there's enough put in that it doesn't feel compromised. It's often beautifully shot by Oswald Morris, a typical but still very rousing score by Philip Sainton, and the special effects and sea action pack a wallop some five or so decades later. Who wouldn't I recommend Moby Dick too? Probably Green Peace people; they'd be the first to take Ahab out.

From Queequeg, with his tattooed body and placid face and cannibalistic tendencies (he sells his heads, after all, before going on the ship with Ishmael), as played by Friedrich Ledebur with a quiet level of enthusiasm and a deep sorrow when he realizes he will die and makes up his coffin. To Starbuck, the one sane character on the ship, who will abide by God's bidding- which is to do the whaling that they've been placed by God to do- and tries his best to have order with his one-track-minded Captain. To the host of supporting characters by Stubb and Peleg. And of course Ishmael, who, by default as the observer of all things on the ship, stays a lot of the time in the background with his narration reflecting his wide-eyed view of this new way of life he's apart of and the realization he faces when there's no going back (Baseheart might be the only so-so actor in the picture, doing what he can to make him a believable presence, though I pictured someone younger in the part).But none is more amazing than the big Captain himself. Gregory Peck was thought as being a little not right for the part of Ahab, that a star who's played many a good hero plays this ultimate bad-ass, one of the quintessential figures of self-destruction manifested by the scars he carries and makes his marks to face off against the white whale. Peck fits in it, somehow, as such a force, who gives him soul when there shouldn't be any, and just those touches of conflict that get brushed away from completing his doomed quest (watch his face when they come across the other ship, where the captain's children have died, and Ahab just freezes up and leaves them to go on with the hunt). It's hard for an actor, especially of Peck's talents of focusing all of the energy and humanity (however in this case soured) in the eyes, to not soak up a character like Ahab. He's a symbol as much as a hero-turned-bad. He leads those under him right into the path of the big beast, who takes away their (possible) God given choice for his own determination. Killing the whale, for Ahab, is like killing a part of himself, what's underneath the mash which he can't stand. Allegory? Why not?It's such rich material that it would need a director like Huston to pull it off. And while I'm sure there would be detractors for a film that didn't contain all of the scope of the novel, there's enough put in that it doesn't feel compromised. It's often beautifully shot by Oswald Morris, a typical but still very rousing score by Philip Sainton, and the special effects and sea action pack a wallop some five or so decades later. Who wouldn't I recommend Moby Dick too? Probably Green Peace people; they'd be the first to take Ahab out.

I haven't read all of the book (there's still some time, hopefully, before I die to get it all in), but from just skimming the surface it is legitimately great literature, a kind of simple-yet-profound sense of the essential flaw of human ambition, and of the horrors with a wrath of God in the form of a vengeful sea captain. It might not be the easiest read- and some of it's authentic 19th century language has been brought over to the screen without much change (lots of 'ye's and such). But it is a bona-fide classic for all times, and John Huston doesn't disappoint even as he crams in the film for a two-hour Hollywoodized treatment.
