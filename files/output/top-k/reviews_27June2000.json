Outside Providence is tame, sort of funny, kind of sweet but mostly lacking that certain something that will make it fun to watch.  I guess the best way to describe it is to say that it is just like most of the films that have come out in the last few years.  It's just okay.  And when the best way to describe a film is with the bland word, okay, then you have problems.Perhaps this film tried to take a page out of Dazed and Confused by setting it all in the 70's.  Evidence to that can be attributed to many things, not which the least of it can be pinpointed to the drugs, the free sex, the school theme, and a few other issues.  But this film doesn't contain the charm of Dazed and it certainly isn't as smart as Dazed.  It is a cheap imitation and it was a deserved failure.The film tells the story of a father, Mr. Dunphy, or Old Man Dunphy, that is tough on his kids but loves them very much.  His oldest son, Timothy, just called Dunphy by his friends, is at that stage of his life where he into drugs, partying and insubordination.  After he goes a step too far ( ramming a parked police car while smoking from a bong that would make Cheech and Chong jealous ) his father pulls a few strings and gets him into a private school.  It'll prepare you for not getting smoked by me, his father explains to him as he sends him off to the school.  Upon reaching the school, he learns that it is more like a prison as there is no drinking, no drugs, no sex, no trips into town without permission, no locks on the doors,  F*** me,  Dunphy says,  and no swearing, the dean informs him.  The deans name is probably the funniest part of the film, Mr. Funderberk  Say it fast enough and you could get kicked out of school for uttering an obsenity.The usual things happen at this prep school.  The kids find a way to do drugs and party and then our little recluse meets the girl of his dreams.  Her name is Jane and she is played by Amy Smart.  I immediately recognized her from Varsity Blues and Road Trip.  She was Vander Beek's plain girlfriend in Blues and she was Beth, the gorgeous sexpot that Breckin Meyer sleeps with in Road Trip.  In Outside Providence, she is supposed to be the unobtainable vixen, the Rose DeWitt Bukater of this prep school.  Of course Dunphy ends up dating her and she changes his life in many ways.  He also becomes noble and at the end of the film he does something that shows how much he has grown.The film is not bad, it's just that it is a nice film.  It is kind of like Mumford, the film that came out last year that no doubt looked great on paper but when it transferred to film, it just lost some of it's edge.  There isn't anything hysterically funny about it, there is nothing new to be said about teenagers, the school isn't different than any other school I've seen in the movies and the characters aren't anything more than cardboard cut-outs of other characters I've seen in a dozen other films.  Alec Baldwin is good as the caring but insensitive dad but that is just a portion of the film. Maybe I've seen too many films and I am expecting to be shocked too much and too often, but this just felt old, stale and tired.  Outside Providence isn't bad, but it isn't that good.

I wanted love, action, patriotism, family, and triumph.  Instead I got cliche, holocaust, incest, insanity, and bitterness.The plot is a fairly simple one Mel was a great fighter once (legendary in fact), but has since hung up his sword and pistol to settle down with his wife and family.  When the Redcoats kill one of his seven children, he kind of snaps and goes back into action like a one-man Terminator.  Easy enough story.  Here were the problems...The filmmakers took almost a full half an hour before anything happened. I don't mean before the first fight, or before the first love scene--I mean ANYTHING.  Mel sitting around (literally) and looking lovingly at both his wife's grave and his children.  By the time the first scene that furthered the plot arrived, I was almost asleep, but I continued to give it the benefit of the doubt.  So they kill the son and Mel goes berserk.  The scene in which he eliminates a rather large band of Redcoats with the help of his two youngest sons is amazing.  I watched it and forgave the slow opening. Here it comes, I thought, The rest of this is going to kick butt.I was wrong.  You see, the incredibly weak script by Robert Rodat (who also wrote Saving Private Ryan, a movie that would have been boring had it not been directed by Steven Spielberg) has to force the idea that war is bad upon us repeatedly, as if we are all so stupid we didn't get it the first eighteen times. SPOILER ALERT The first son has to die--that makes sense.  It allows Mel to go back into action.  Then a bunch of other people die.  Then more of his children die. Then some more people die.  Then a guy kills himself.  Then the entire population of a town gets burned alive inside a church (the most unnecessary moment in the entire movie).  I'm sure I'm forgetting the other hundred people who bit it along the way as well.  The point is, kill one son to have Mel seek revenge.  Have some battles in which tons of people die (it worked in Private Ryan and Braveheart), just make sure it's no one you convinced us to care about.  If you really want to prove that the bad guy is evil, have him attempt to burn up the church, or give the order or something.  YOU DON'T ACTUALLY DO IT!As if that overkill wasn't enough, everyone has to end up happy in the end, as if none of it had happened.  All the men who lost their families are happy and dancing, the slaveowner loves the slave, the house that had been burned down is being built again, and the children who were upset with their parents suddenly love them once more.  They are so happy, in fact, that Chris Cooper almost smiles.  Worst of all, there's Mel Gibson, the man who lost his entire family, his home, his tranquility, his peace of mind, his connection with God, and his sanity, standing there waving the flag in patriotic triumph.On top of all of that, the movie is full of badly directed scenes (I'm not surprised--the director also helmed Universal Soldier and Godzilla), poorly written dialogue, and loooooooooooooooong monologues that could just as easily have been seen, not heard.  SHOW ME, DON'T TELL ME!I can't believe Mel Gibson accepted the role, $25 million payoff or not. Even more, I can't believe he didn't stop halfway through it and say, Listen guys, you all suck, I have two Academy Awards, let me finish directing this thing properly.To compare this to Braveheart is an insult.  This is the kind of movie that tries to be a thoughtful, dramatic, sensitive experience, but instead completely disrespects its characters, betrays its own hyped-up emotions, and gives the finger to the audience.  It's as if the filmmakers are telling us that if we don't understand or sympathize with the characters, we are bad people.Don't let them manipulate you, even though that is what they are trying desperately to do.  This movie is mediocre at best.  Bottom line is this Although I like Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger immensely, all this movie managed to do was piss me off.  With the actors they had and the epic subject matter they had access to, this could have been a true classic. What they did with it was downright unpatriotic.

You see, the incredibly weak script by Robert Rodat (who also wrote Saving Private Ryan, a movie that would have been boring had it not been directed by Steven Spielberg) has to force the idea that war is bad upon us repeatedly, as if we are all so stupid we didn't get it the first eighteen times. SPOILER ALERT The first son has to die--that makes sense.  It allows Mel to go back into action.  Then a bunch of other people die.  Then more of his children die. Then some more people die.  Then a guy kills himself.  Then the entire population of a town gets burned alive inside a church (the most unnecessary moment in the entire movie).  I'm sure I'm forgetting the other hundred people who bit it along the way as well.  The point is, kill one son to have Mel seek revenge.  Have some battles in which tons of people die (it worked in Private Ryan and Braveheart), just make sure it's no one you convinced us to care about.  If you really want to prove that the bad guy is evil, have him attempt to burn up the church, or give the order or something.  YOU DON'T ACTUALLY DO IT!As if that overkill wasn't enough, everyone has to end up happy in the end, as if none of it had happened.  All the men who lost their families are happy and dancing, the slaveowner loves the slave, the house that had been burned down is being built again, and the children who were upset with their parents suddenly love them once more.  They are so happy, in fact, that Chris Cooper almost smiles.  Worst of all, there's Mel Gibson, the man who lost his entire family, his home, his tranquility, his peace of mind, his connection with God, and his sanity, standing there waving the flag in patriotic triumph.On top of all of that, the movie is full of badly directed scenes (I'm not surprised--the director also helmed Universal Soldier and Godzilla), poorly written dialogue, and loooooooooooooooong monologues that could just as easily have been seen, not heard.  SHOW ME, DON'T TELL ME!I can't believe Mel Gibson accepted the role, $25 million payoff or not. Even more, I can't believe he didn't stop halfway through it and say, Listen guys, you all suck, I have two Academy Awards, let me finish directing this thing properly.To compare this to Braveheart is an insult.  This is the kind of movie that tries to be a thoughtful, dramatic, sensitive experience, but instead completely disrespects its characters, betrays its own hyped-up emotions, and gives the finger to the audience.

I wanted love, action, patriotism, family, and triumph.  Instead I got cliche, holocaust, incest, insanity, and bitterness.The plot is a fairly simple one Mel was a great fighter once (legendary in fact), but has since hung up his sword and pistol to settle down with his wife and family.  When the Redcoats kill one of his seven children, he kind of snaps and goes back into action like a one-man Terminator.  Easy enough story.  Here were the problems...The filmmakers took almost a full half an hour before anything happened. I don't mean before the first fight, or before the first love scene--I mean ANYTHING.  Mel sitting around (literally) and looking lovingly at both his wife's grave and his children.  By the time the first scene that furthered the plot arrived, I was almost asleep, but I continued to give it the benefit of the doubt.  So they kill the son and Mel goes berserk.  The scene in which he eliminates a rather large band of Redcoats with the help of his two youngest sons is amazing.  I watched it and forgave the slow opening.

A movie about a bunch of guys beating the crap out of each other didn't hold much appeal for most women except, I suppose, those who hate men. And why would someone use a pink bar of soap to advertise such a film? I didn't know and I didn't particularly care. I knew I'd get around to seeing it eventually--where and when didn't seem too important. But, after viewing a rented copy of this movie, I find I want to know everything I possibly can about it.Surprisingly, Fight Club is a relationship movie. It's about the relationships one man has with himself, and others, and what they all represent. And, like most of my favorite tales, it includes at least one poignant love story.The narrator of Fight Club, played brilliantly by Edward Norton, begins as a lonely insomniac. We accompany him on his search for some meaning in his life, which is irrevocably altered after meeting a new single-serving friend (Brad Pitt) on one of his many business trips. This new friend, who sells homemade boutique soaps, introduces the lost young man to a far more lively lifestyle, where each experience is met head-on and where fighting becomes a way to connect with other lost souls like himself.The relationships in this film are complex and, for the most part, well-developed, with Fight Club being the character binding most of the others together. There are no women involved in the fight scenes of the movie, but there are a couple of women with significant roles, particularly Helena Bonham Carter, who plays the love interest. She seems to be on a mission to reverse the typecasting of the virtuous women she played in most of her early films and she certainly succeeds with Fight Club. I had a hard time relating to this brash woman throughout most of the film, identifying more with the male characters, though I never felt eager to fight. In the end, her character illustrated the differences that men and women have in dealing with the same situations and feelings.The Fight Club DVD set truly takes advantage of the format in the best possible way, with multiple commentary tracks and all sorts of technical information for how'd they do that? viewers like myself.

However, there is a comparison I can afford to make. Forget EYE OF THE BEHOLDER. SHAFT is easily the worst movie I've seen to date of 2000, and anyone who goes to movies expecting even a minimal level of substance will be nonplused by this film. With a weak and unengaging story, single-dimensional characters, dull action, and idiotic humor, SHAFT nearly had me dying of boredom while everyone else in the theater may have been dying from laughter.For about 20-25 minutes, SHAFT sets itself up nicely and brings out laughter from profanity-stemmed jokes, but there should be a point in every movie where its time to pull the audience into the story and try something A LITTLE different, which never happens here. Somehow, the simple act of Jeffery Wright's latino drug-lord speaking seemed to send audiences into convulsions, certainly due to his thick, over-the-top accent. It's impossible to care about any of the characters either. Toni Collette and Christian Bale do solid acting jobs with the few scenes each of them are given, but their characters have zero depth.Samuel L. Jackson, however, is basically the movie's only redeeming quality. With a firm handle on dangerous situations, a peltiful supply of charisma, and a glare that would frighten anyone who tries to mess with him, Jackson's John Shaft is definitely a cool action hero. Ultimately, it doesn't matter, because the contrast of him to everything else in the movie is shocking. He's a sylistic guy caught in a bland, boring story surrounded by a gallery of over-the-top but uninteresting characters. The action sequences of course, are loud and chaotic, but there's no suspense and no true sense of danger. The climactic struggle between Shaft and Peoples seems like it's been done before (the whole I've got a key hostage at gunpoint thing), and I really couldn't possibly care less whether the cliched drug lord died or lived.To add insult to injury, the conclusion is simply unacceptable. Christian Bale's character, Walter Wade, is obviously the real villian here, and despite Shaft's burning desire to bring him down, a confrontation between these two never occurs. This cheats the audience out of the genuine catharsis and triumph that always comes with a good action movie. No one at the theater I went to seemed to care though; they were too busy soaking up the laughs to stop and think for just a second or two.In the final analysis, SHAFT is one of those movies that simply makes you loathe Hollywood. This film is so full of itself that it seems to think that profanity alone is funny when timed right. Personally, I call that offensive. There's really no edge or gags of any type to go along with the cursing, which probably doesn't matter to this film's target audience. This summer, if you want intense action to pump the adrenaline, see MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2. For an epic story with characters worth caring about, see GLADIATOR. For humor, I recommend SMALL TIME CROOKS in that arena. See anything.... anything but a movie as full of itself as SHAFT.

There are some big laughs involved with the size of the title character, as well as her with breasts, attitude, sexuality, and ignorance, but there are also some obvious audience pleasers that feel contrived. Although the make-up effects are astonishing and amusing, there are no surprises found within this material. We have already seen this film's punch line in better parodies like Some Like It Hot, Tootsie, and Mrs. Doubtfire. This movie is predictable, over-enthusiastic, and does not take off with its ideas. \tMartin Lawrence stars as a cop named Malcolm, who, with his partner John (Paul Giamatti), is assigned to investigate the jail bust of a convicted criminal named Laster (Terrence Dashon Howard). They suspect the murderer is after his ex-girlfriend, Sherry (Nia Long), and her son Trent (Jascha Washington), who may unknowingly own the stolen loot of a bank heist years ago. Sherry is somewhat aware of the danger she may be in, thus moves immediately to her relative's house, whom everyone calls Big Mamma (Ella Mitchell). Before Sherry arrives, however, Big Mamma leaves town for an engagement. John and Malcolm see potential involved with Big Mamma, thus they determine that having Malcolm go undercover as this character might originate information on Sherry's involvement with Laster's criminal actions. \tMartin Lawrence, reprising his Blue Streak character, is perfect for the fast talking Mamma in which he disguises himself. The actor is in nearly every scene and is basically what the movie structures upon one excessive comic situation after another featuring the concealed Malcolm participating in activities from karate class to a joyful church service and from the kitchen baking goodies to sleeping with the unknowing Sherry. Lawrence makes the movie succeed to the level that it does, however, his high spirits and willing energy only carry the film so far. It is only a matter of time before he wares out his welcome and becomes the only thing holding the story together. \tThe film does not stay focused on the plot of Laster attempting to reach Sherry; if a comedy makes the misconception to take its plot seriously, then it requires consistence. Here, although the setup contains potential, the only tension involved is when Sherry will discover her Big Mamma is an undercover cop. Essentially the movie's story is just an excuse to have Martin Lawrence play a funny character who does funny things.\tThe film's director is Raja Gosnell, whose Never Been Kissed and Home Alone 3 provided trifling laughs, just like Big Mamma's House does. In this film, he and screenwriters Darryl Quarles and Don Rhymer attempt to do too much with too little like developing a romantic subplot that feels trite and predictable.

It's more about experiencing these characters and situations, the sort of overall seductive nature of Lynch's film-making from the cool opening credits sequence till the peculiar ending. Pullman in one of his best parts (this time having to really 'do' something with a character, however restrained he might be,) plays a musician who is sentenced to death for murdering his wife.

But then something happens while he's awaiting the chair, by way of a pill meant to help him sleep...and then suddenly, it's not Pullman anymore...or is it?To say that this is Lynch messing with his fans and non-fans is an understatement, but in the end I more remember the images, the flashes of garish, nightmarish specks from reality than the full-on story. Robert Blake in white-face, Loggia as the male-dominating gangster, two versions of a male character with Pullman as one and Balthazar Getty as the other, these are some perks to the film. But there is also a troubled turn by Patricia Arquette- one scene involving some explicit sex is more than disturbing- and a couple of twists that almost bring whiplash.

Didn't they check with the Coen Brothers?  Kirstie Alley's accent was just atrocious, and Kirsten Dunst's was about as consistent as Kevin Costner's English accent in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves.  Denise Richards didn't even bother with one (good for her), and the rest of the cast had either non-existent or ridiculous accents.** SOME SPOILERS INCLUDED **And if that was all that was wrong with the movie, it would still be watchable.  However, the acting was as bad as the accents and the script was even worse.  Hands for everyone who guessed the float would explode as soon as the antagonist says, It smells like gasoline?  How about those who knew that their would be a massive food poisoning outbreak as soon as Dunst said that she didn't eat shellfish?  And how many thought that the poison twist was just a trite way for the writers to unbox themselves from a very lengthy movie?  At the 90-minute mark it seems fishy indeed.  And if you pay attention to the very end, you'll hear people scream just BEFORE the reporter gets it.Also, there are some very unfunny and offensive shots taken at handicapped people, both physically and mentally.  Ellen Barkin's attempt to open a beer can with a prosthetic arm was just stupid, and the whole Hank character served no purpose other than let's laugh at the retard -- and if you think that it's not PC to use that term, the movie uses it several times from several different characters, even some of the sympathetic ones.Dunst wasn't bad (except for the accent), and Richards was pretty good, but almost everyone else in this movie stinks it up.  Honorable mention for Worst Actress was a tie between the two 'state board' officials at the Puke Pageant.  These two were the pits in a movie straining to bottom out. If you want to see an effective and intelligent satire of beauty pageants, watch Smile.  Avoid this cinematic t**d at all costs.

Someone must have called in a lot of favors to get this cast paired with Eric Blakeney in his first feature film.  The story was ininspired and the directing was awful.This film attempts to be a cross between &#145;Donnie Brasco' and &#145;Analyze This' and is a poor imitation on both counts.  The comedy was sophomoric slapstick and just didn't fit well with the police story.  At times I wasn't sure whether Blakeney intended this to be a lampoon of cop movies or a comedy cop caper.  It doesn't really matter.  It didn't work either way.It was incongruous to see actors like Liam Neeson and Sandra Bullock in a film with such a low budget look and such poor direction.  The dialogue was eyerolling bad.  Blakeney tried to be clever, but just succeeded in making a fool of everyone, especially himself for writing this tripe.Liam Neeson was miscast in this role.  He is a great dramatic actor, but a comedian he will never be.  Sandra Bullock didn't really have much to do here other than bring another name to the marquee.  Oliver Platt was the closest thing to providing saving grace to this film as he was consistently funny.Eric Blakeney and Hollywood Pictures should be tried and convicted for actor and audience abuse with this film.  I rated it a 3\/10.  Even Neeson and Bullock fans will want to miss this one.

It is pretty much on the level of a good TV movie, with the exception of Helen Mirren, who is exceptional. The way she slowly gets into the minds of the kids, the way she knows exactly how to manipulate them and get them to mistrust one another is the creepy part of the film.The fact that the film does not fit easily into a specified genre is not, in itself, a bad thing. Many of us love entertainments like Buffy the Vampire Slayer for that very reason. This film is pretty successful in much the same way.I'm surprised by the many comments made here on how the Exorcist routine was pointless but well-done, as if the reference comes out of nowhere. Right after the kids tie up Mrs. Tingle, they comment on how she looks just like that girl in the Exorcist, you know, the one that vomits on everyone. This is a pretty funny insult to make. Funnier because Mrs. Tingle does resemble the possessed Regan (her face is all cut up; she's nice one second, evil the next; she has an uncanny ability to know each characters personal weakness). This is what causes the Jo Lynn character (a ham who is constantly trying to impress with her impersonations) to go into the Exorcist routine when she gets bored. I thought the setup and payoff was pretty obvious. It's pretty sad when Kevin Williamson jokes go over the audiences' head.
