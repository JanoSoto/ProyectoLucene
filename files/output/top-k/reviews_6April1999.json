With the appreciation of the little things and peculiar details that make a person's character unique, not mention the small-town soul, Altman has managed to make this film one of the most memorable character descriptions that I have enjoyed in a film.  For some reason aunt Camille, the character that Glenn Close plays gets a little bit out of control but lends the film a considerable humor.  This is by far the best film by Altman that I have seen.

Refreshing because, unlike most other period films, it does not strive to give the audience a history lesson or preach pompously - indeed, historical accuracy is all but ignored.  This film does not take itself too seriously, and seeks to entertain rather than enlighten. Plunkett and Macleane is set in the 18th century, yet director Jake Scott offers a thoroughly 90s take. There's action, sex and swearing aplenty, and in the inevitable ball scene the aristocracy dance to disco beats.  Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are brilliant as always, and the rest of the cast, especially Alan Cumming as a flirtatious fop,  are also highly entertaining.  The film is visually spectacular in places, and is a mixture of comedy, action and drama, with a love interest provided by Liv Tyler with a shaky english accent.  In short, if you're looking for an entertaining couple of hours, this is the film for you.  It won't make you think, but it could well put a smile on your face.

I suppose it's not his fault that he's been reduced to playing a stereotyped detective in Falling Down, one who is (as is so often the case in such cliched assembly line movies) on the verge of retirement when he's called out on one last case.  Well, Duvall's fault or not, it is his visage that was rapidly flashing across my TV screen as I fast-forwarded past his scenes to the slightly more interesting ones with Michael Douglas.  If I were of another generation, one that thought of Douglas as something other than Kirk's son, perhaps I would not find this double Oscar winner (for co-producing One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and as best actor for Wall Street) so undistinguished.  To me, he reached his peak as Karl Malden's partner on TV's Streets of San Francisco and comes across on screen as smaller than life.  In Falling Down, he is D-Fens (a name taken from his personalized license plate), a burnt out defense department worker who thinks the world is going to Hell in that proverbial handbasket.  On a day when the temperature in Los Angeles would make even Hades seem cool, D-Fens finally cracks and goes on a violent rampage with the aid of a machine gun he swipes from a gang member.  With his nerdy buzz-cut, short-sleeved white shirt, and pocket protector, Douglas puts on an entertaining show, if not a credible one.  But who can blame him?  The direction by Joel Schumacher is pedestrian, and so is the script by Ebbe Roe Smith.  As Douglas' wife, the lovely Barbara Hershey is wasted, while Tuesday Weld as Duvall's plump, nagging wife is unrecognizable.  Falling Down isn't dull, that's for sure, but it's little more than a cleaned-up retread of Death Wish, a much more provocative film.
