So instead I'm going to briefly touch on the impact this film had on me as an individual.  Carpe Diem (sieze the day).  That pretty much sums up the feeling that this film instilled in me after viewing it.  It made me realize that there are more important things in life than just following tradition and doing what is expected of you.  It showed me that I must follow my own path in life, with what makes me truly happy, rather than conform with what is expected of me.  Also, I don't think I have ever been so touched by a single scene in a movie like I was with the final scene in this movie.  When you could see the guilt in the eyes of the Ethan Hawke character, knowing that he was partially responsible for Mr. Keating's dismissal.  You could tell he just wanted to tell Mr Keating how much he meant to all of his friends and him.  And you could also see the forgivness in the eyes of Robin Williams, knowing that the boys were not to blame, but rather the establishment.  And when Mr. Keating was just about to leave the classroom for the last time, and Ethan Hawke jumped up on his desk and addressed Mr Keating Captain, My Captain!... I literally wept out loud.  I have never cried during a movie like I did with this one.  I literally bawled that entire scene (when the students stood up on their desks), and didn't stop until half-way through the final credits.  Anyone that enjoys being moved and touched by a movie MUST see this one.  It will also add two important words to your vocabulary.... CARPE DIEM.

It must be noticed during these years of intellectual poorness in american movies. It's not to say that there have been no clever movies but the most noticed movies were not. In France we keep overall movies like Rocky IV or Rambo where the hero is the stronger, he never dies and saves the world (what could we do without Americans ?). The point of view of Carpenter is very courageous, he shows what consumption society makes (consume, obey) and has that few people awares of it. It was an era where money and economical liberalism were ruling human relationnship. Carpenter couldn't stand this and showed it by the way of th seventh art. That's what movies should be made for  engadgement in the author's mind by the work. There are not a lot of movies today having surprised the viewer like this, by its cleaverness. The last american one is In the company of men by Neil LaBute. There are scenes which will stay in the memory of the person who watches, like the fight. You think it's going to end but it continues, and continues. In a typical movie it ends after one or two minutes, but there, no way. John Carpenter breaks the rules and this nihilism (see the name of the hero  Nada) was not the american way of life. By breaking the rules of movies he broke the rules of american society. There has been two other heroes, created also by Carpenter  Snake Plissken and Jack Crow. They are not perfect, they have weaknesses, they are just humans. They don't really make dream the spectator  but they're more similar to him than Armaggedon or Independance day's characters. The perfection is a notion that carpenter doesn't like, in his different movies (village of damned, Vampire$) the heroes lose sometimes, they're not more clever, they get f***** (the motel's scene in Vampire$). They live is a film about the human, the perfection and freedom. Carpenter broke rules of American society (and way of making films)in order to promode a typical American value  the freedom.

But still the question is... why?Van Sant says we should remake movies just like we re-stage Shakespeare plays. Well, guess what? You can't rent a live performance, that's why you have to do them again. A film is a finished thing that everyone can see. The other thing is... even if it's good, Van Sant can't take any credit for it, because it's just a recreation. I guess Universal has a lot of money to throw away.Van Sant also said that he wants to bring this movie to a new generation. Well, I think if so he needed to write a new version of the same story, because film pacing and effects have come so far, this film feels too slow to young audiences. Most people in my audience said That's it? and That's not scary! at the end. So...

But still the question is... why?Van Sant says we should remake movies just like we re-stage Shakespeare plays. Well, guess what? You can't rent a live performance, that's why you have to do them again. A film is a finished thing that everyone can see. The other thing is... even if it's good, Van Sant can't take any credit for it, because it's just a recreation.

With the exception of Harrison Ford and Sir Alec Guinness, it's pretty bland.  Is it just nostalgia of 20\/30-somethings who were kids and teens when it was relelased?  Sure, that's part of it.But above all the rest, the reason Star Wars is still at the forefront of our collective consciousness is the fact that it is a modern fairy tale.
