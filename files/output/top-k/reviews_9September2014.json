You know, the only time I've heard of Marty is in Robert Redford's Quiz Show when it becomes an integral part of the plot. John Turturro is made to say that On The Waterfront won Best Picture in 1955 instead of Marty and everyone, including Turturro, speaks about Marty with such fondness. Nowadays it's hardly mentioned, but it remains one of the Academy's most inspired choices for Best Picture, Director and Actor. It had my heart by the first scene and played with it the rest of the time. It's deliciously simple, set within a day or two and its scale is as small as you can make a gratifying movie. It's all about the characters, the warm, sensitive, deeply human characters. They may toss around typical lingo but they speak the truth in every word.Ernest Borgnine's performance is wonderful, delicately nuanced, utterly sympathetic and easily identifiable. He's an insecure and broken man stuck in a subversive tough guy shell. A gentle man that you support in every endeavour instantly and constantly chant Marty when he has to make a choice. The film is built entirely around organic conversations that are intimate in a way that you can't find in other mainstream films of its time. Paddy Chayefsky's mind-reading script is sharply economic and often says the things you think but other films wouldn't touch. The film is a very thoughtful and poignant meditation on love and relationships. It examines the pressures we get from society, the stigmas and the fulfillment we get from love. Although subplots feel extraneous at first and though they may be inconsequential, they add a lot to its themes and depict the pros and cons from the future of the relationships that we revolve our lives round.But above all, the point that's the most important is how the film is about the motivational inspirations you get from the people you bond with and how they ultimately fuel your life. It's contagious to watch. The only downside to the film is that it's fundamentally built on exposition and it does favour developing Marty over his elating love interest Clara a little too much. The experience is still slickly cinematic thanks to a lovable cast, jazzy music and stellar cinematography. It grabs you in its simplest moments and is wholly satisfying and refreshing, even if the stakes are inherently low. If I ever had to adapt a film into a play, I'd jump to this as my first choice. Marty is a complete package in a delightfully inspiring, emotionally engaging and thoroughly profound way. It's all that I love about movies and stories.

Organized as a series of tableaux separated by title cards, IF... spends its first half depiction the harsh rules that these boys live under at their elite public school, and the arbitrary punishments given out by senior boys, headed by the sinister Rowntree (Robert Swann) and the distant school officials. This is all in an environment of bizarre old rituals, Latin refrains, and hardly more intelligible English public school slang (and of course, it wouldn't be a classic story of British public school life without some innuendo about buggery.) Then, as the storytelling takes on an increasingly surreal tone where we question what is real and what is fantasy, the boys and a girl from town get their hands on weapons and go after those who have wrong them.The 1960s was a time of war in Vietnam (and other violent conflicts brought to viewers globally by the media) and youth uprisings in the United States and France.

In IF..., the walls of these boys' dormitory is covered with magazine cutouts of war photographs, as if to say that in a violent world, it is no surprise if the young too made recourse to violence. In this respect it feels very much like a precursor to Aki Kaurismäki's THE MATCH FACTORY GIRL. IF... also reflects the new sexual freedom of 1960s Britain, and the frustration kindled in these young men who see such open sexual expression in magazines and town streets but cannot have any of it. There are a number of films from this era that document the rise of a counterculture and more open attitudes, but few are as sympathetic to these young people as this film of Anderson and Sherwin.The only serious flaw of IF... is that the main actors are too old to convincingly play teenagers, being in their mid 20s at the time of shooting. Imagine how much more shocking the film would be if it were real sixth-formers acting, though I suppose the (few) sex scenes made this impossible. Also, I must express my discontent with the quality of the audio, which is very muddy.

Good part of the series ends to this movie and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre like but even worse splatter series with zombie Jason starts from next. This movie have least irritating and stupid humor and characters of series. There is them too but still its the least stupid from others. Also good idea of making fake Jason instead of not so good idea of making Tom new Jason (which was not done fortunately and in which movies name refers) was according to making story some kind of accidental but is still quite well made. Its sad that people need to have every part same like and if somebody have good idea without for example same antagonist its automatically bad. 6th part is dull and idiotic but fans like it better than this and even 7th...

But the whole thing was a trap so Sybok could get his hands on the Enterprise. With the starship and its crew under his command, Sybok sets to find a planet from Vulcan mythology where creation began, located in the center of the universeWidely considered the worst Star Trek film of the original series. Actually, I should say widely considered the worst Star Trek film period. It's hard to dispute this. The mountain climbing scene, the campfire scene, and 56 year-old Uhura's 'sexy' dance are some of the most embarrassingly bad scenes the original Trek crew ever filmed, on the big screen or small. A lot of this can be laid at the doorstep of William Shatner, who makes his film directing debut with this movie and does a terrible job. But let's save a good deal of the blame for screenwriter David Loughery, whose script is pathetic. The story itself might have worked in the hands of a better director and writer. The idea that the crew goes on a mission that takes them face-to-face with a being claiming to be God has a lot of potential. Unfortunately little is done with the idea and the payoff to the whole thing is underwhelming. Sybok is a lame character limply played by Laurence Luckinbill. Considering the movie revolves around him, it's unfortunate they couldn't get a more dynamic actor for the part. Sadder still is how the character is written as a cult leader with some kind of power to sway people over to his side, yet this power is frustratingly never explained. The regular cast all play their parts as well as can be expected given the poor script. There's a lot of comedy in this one and it's hit or miss. The special effects are spotty, as well. All of this taken into account, it's easy to see why it's so hated. But I'm going to back off my complaints somewhat and say that, while it's certainly not a good film, it is still watchable. This is Star Trek with Shatner, Nimoy, Kelley, Doohan, etc. I would watch them even if it was just 90 minutes of them yelling at kids to get off their lawn and turn off their rap music.

I'm fortunate that my parents let me watch Jaws, and I loved it. Seeing Close Encounters of the Third Kind at a friend's house left lasting images and ideas in my mind. But E.T. did nothing for me, despite the fact that it was in theory Spielberg's most child-oriented blockbuster. When I saw it for the first and (until now) only time, I was the same demographic as the child star, but the experience was, frankly, boring. I remember feeling, if not putting into words, that the movie with the boy and the inarticulate, Yoda- like puppet was slow and cold. It was far less engaging to me than the other Spielberg titles to which I had been exposed. I don't remember if I knew that they were products of the same director, but the art of movies, which Ebert compared to a machine that generates empathy, a tool for looking at the world through different eyes, was working on me I was already accustomed to relating to adults on screen instead of just kids. Whatever holes E.T. might have filled for me as a nascent movie buff were already occupied by more grown-up, and therefore more exciting, material. If I was in the mood for pure fun with a sci-fi flavor, the Star Wars VHS tapes with their more attention-grabbing special effects and attention-keeping pace were right there. It was no contest.Revisiting E.T. now, I don't see much cause to regret my early rejection of it. In fact, it's probably worse now, because it's hard to find an original cut; I had to watch the ill-advised digital remaster, in which certain camera positions no longer make sense, and the actors are often looking just behind E.T. instead of at him as they presumably did when he was a puppet instead of pixels. Even ignoring the awkwardness of the digital content, which really does great damage to the feel and persona of the title character, there's little in E.T. that feels real or fresh. The first part of the film takes place mainly in the home of the boy Elliott. The house always seems dim on the inside, lit by late afternoon sun even when it's midday outside. Elliott makes an emotional connection with the alien almost too easily, aided by an unexplained psychic connection between the two, and he causes some chaos with frogs in a heavy-handed scene that Spielberg seems determined to cram with ideas never to be unpacked.Elliott and his older brother are bland, generic kids, and they gang up on their young sister, who is a breath of fresh air and a splash of color around the edges of the increasingly disturbing main story. It's not just that Drew Barrymore is cute in the role; she's also a natural actor, stealing scenes from all her older costars plus the alien. Having a real live Barrymore on their hands, you'd think the filmmakers would have rethought the whole thing and cast her as E.T.'s main companion. It's her, after all, who teaches E.T. his most important vocabulary words and figures out what he wants to do phone home.The final act takes an unsatisfying route to this conclusion with a messily-edited, illogical home invasion by astronauts that segues into a dark riff on the massive government operation from Close Encounters. It's a nightmarish cycle of silly and sad and shrill right up to the final scene, but there are two particular moments that do work. These are the iconic bicycle flights, one eclipsing the moon and the other the sun, and they are made magical and memorable with the help of John Williams's accompanying score. I might appreciate these moments more now than I did as a kid, having seen them depicted in Spielberg's production logo over the years and developed a fondness for the idea of them.

This flick should switch around ratings with Never Cry Wolf, which is a '7.6' a horrid & disappointing film that was downright BORING & ridiculous & uncomfortable to sit through, and should be totally removed from the Walt Disney category!!They're just so many good things in this film. The train always gets fabulous shots, too. That scene on the bridge of trying to outrun the train will always seem to scare me. LOLThe frostbite in this movie really sends shivers down my spine - after all, it was the movie that introduced me to the reality of frostbite. Just looking at Stoneman at the end of the movie, he looks messed up! He gave everything he had to finish that race!I mean it, if I ever go on live TV, I'll make sure to bring this movie with me to show on air, just to give it the attention it deserves & needs!Disney Channel! Get this film on the air sometime! Or at the very least, Disney, re-release this movie so that we can again see the true story about Will Stoneman on the big screen!Beautifully directed, beautifully shot, and beautifully acted!9\/10!!

I was privileged, I repeat, PRIVILEGED to have grown up with this film! VERY appropriately rated as a Disney film, yes! Families all around can enjoy this film! Along with Balto, this flick introduced me to the sport of dog sledding! Also introduced me to many big Hollywood names, like Kevin Spacey, Brian Cox, Brian Ogden Stiers (RENOWNED for Disney movies), and especially August Schellenberg (R.I.P). They all played their appropriate roles. Although, I'll admit, I don't often like Kevin Spacey as an actor - always seems to act as antisocial & controversial characters. Also don't forget Richard Riehle, the guy who says If you're late again, you're fired, near the beginning of the movie; classic character actor of the century (in over 300 films!!!). Plus, I like the idea of John Terry playing Will's father, and just all-round playing father figures - he's just so kind & likable.I'm utterly surprised to this day why this film is so overlooked & underrated! After all, 1994 *was* the big year of MANY big blockbuster films; maybe that's why it was so overlooked. Mackenzie Astin, the brother of Sean Astin (Sam from Lord of the Rings), is great in this film! Such an under-appreciated actor! IMO, he's even hotter & more talented than Leo DiCaprio. He plays a REAL ACE in this movie - I fully realize just how well-written his character is!

I'll admit discovering that Disney made a horror film was unreal to me, I felt this was great because it really showed that Disney was starting to take chances they were starting to take the next step. It's a shame Disney didn't make more horror films, I really would of liked to of seen them.The film seems like a lost anthology tale for the TV show Are you Afraid of the Dark because like with that show this is a horror film for the family film genre which I think is really cool since we really don't have that many. It is a very tricky feet trying to mix both the horror and family genre, but this film I feel is one done right because it's able to successful balance out both without watering itself down.I really like the production value and even cinematography of the film which I think have some memorable visuals; I really liked how the film used the forest locale, the use of light and shadow which made the woods a character in itself as it emits a sense of mystery and menace. I even like the ruined chapel location which almost looks like part of a level in the video game Castlevania which looked spooky from it's Gothic feel and structure and amount of darkness that emitted almost a creepy feeling. Or even the viewpoint of the Watcher which adds to the creep factor because you not sure what this thing or entity is about to do, even thought it's not doing anything now you know it will soon.Music is solid, though not memorable which to me is one of the weak points of the film, I wish this film had a more memorable score but still it was good enough to give the film the right moodiness it has.I really like the story, it's not really a ghost story there really isn't a ghost per say it's more of a psychic mystery thriller, which I think is cool since we don't get nearly enough of those in the horror genre. The suspense is solid, yeah it's a slow burn but I don't mind because as the film gets further things start to escalate. You really have a creepy and disorienting feeling throughout the film because your not entirely sure what's going to happen next or even what all this is leading up to. The mystery I think is very good, it has a great amount of intrigue, there are clues but they're not obvious, we can see them but we can't entirely decipher their meaning or know how they really go together; and I like that feeling it really makes it feel like a real mystery, causing us to think and figure things out. Characters I think are pretty solid from the adult characters mainly Mrs. Aylwood played by Bette Davis one of her last roles. She is pretty much that mysterious wise women on the side of road character but I really like how you actually kind feel for her, as we see throughout the years she has been plagued by this mystery of not knowing what happened to her daughter which is a terrible feeling and in a way just motives you to want the protagonists to solve the mystery and win.And I like both the young female protagonists. Kyle Richards is solid as Elle Curtis and on a side note this actress played Linsey in John Carpenter's Halloween which is cool since that's one of my favorite horror films and that's two horror films in a row for the actress which isn't bad. Anyway, I like that she's not some stereotypical annoying little sister but she a sweet girl, she has a bit of charisma, loves dogs, despite young she's not totally naive she does exercise some intelligence.Lynn Holy Johnson I also thought was solid\/decent as Jan Curtis, her character is solid, she takes charge, cares for her little sister; there's a good back and forth between both of them, and I like that she's very open doesn't dismiss what's happening as things shes just seeing. Both the sisters are psychics but don't entirely know it or have no idea how to control it, each of them have the ability but it works different. For Elle it's mainly in hearing, she is able to hear voices from a distance or pick up sounds no others can hear, much like with a dog that can hear certain frequencies. Jan it's sight, where she can see images for a certain amount of time and occur at different times.This makes both sympathetic because their in the same boat as us, their struggling to figure out what in the hell is going on, why this is all happening to them. There are some memorable images like one scene which was creepy was Jan putting up a mirror and then when she looks at it again she doesn't see her reflection. But for me the best scene was in the mirror maze when we see Jan suddenly see multiple images of a girl, blind folded and from her lip movements is constantly saying help me.What also makes this films stand out are two of it's endings. I personally really liked the original ending they choice for the film it felt right and well balanced, though I even liked the alternate ending which I thought good let alone even stranger, I won't say what it is you just have to see both for yourself.Like any sight in the woods is worth a watch.Rating 3 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"9 September 2014","score":"","review":" The woods to me can be one of the creepiest places to be because you never really know what's hidden out there.This film is another underrated and forgotten gem.

The main character, Truman Burbank, stars in a wildly popular television show about the picture-perfect little town of Seahaven, which resides inside a large dome in Hollywood, California. The ultimate goal is to entertain the general public by filming the life of one citizen's entire life without having been given consent to do so. Therefore, everyone in the town is an actor, and everyone in the world knows about it&#x85; Except Truman. The Truman Show is an example of many satirical aspects, including a central problem, irony, and connotation. The movie goes into great depth about how Truman's life seemed so perfect to everyone, until he finds out and he does not find it so perfect. In our society, everyone believes everyone else's lives are so much more perfect than their own. This is highlighted in the way that the movie directors have no idea why Truman is so anxious to get out once he starts to uncover the truth. Additionally, we find ourselves heavily identifying with Truman, and feeling his same pain as he struggles to break free of the world that was created around him. The world revolved around him, and it was all that he wanted to escape. The directors of the The Truman Show in the movie often disregard the fact that Truman is human, not a caged animal to be observed. They also fail to realize that his fighting for his freedom is more ethical than them trying to keep it away from him. Indeed, they often make it seem like the end of the Truman Show is the end of the world, but it's only the end of Truman Burbank's involvement in a world that was never real.

With 'Misery', he has given us a story so close to autobiographical horror that you could be forgiven for being duped into thinking it actually happened to him.Paul Sheldon is a talented writer who has been bashing out trashy pulp romances which take place in the early 1900's involving a woman named Misery Chastain. They are wildly successful novels which amass him a fortune, facilitate sending his daughter to the best schools and all the other luxuries that a writer of such success enjoys. But he feels as though he has sold out, he has a burning urge to publish his 'real' book and to be taken more seriously, and in this adaptation of King's novel, we are introduced to him as he finishes his opus while holed up in a remote cabin in Colorado. He then attempts to navigate his car through a blizzard and ends up skidding off the road and landing on a snowy bank, upside down. A figure appears and carries him out of the snowed in vehicle. This figure, we soon learn, is Annie Wilkes, and she is his self-proclaimed 'number one fan'. She also happens to be a nurse, and begins the long process of treating his injuries and nursing him back to health in her home. She tells him she has called a doctor and been given what seems fairly reasonable advice about keeping him there until the weather clears if she is able to take care of him herself. I assure you that sharing these plot details gives nothing away, they are merely set-up for the very dark path the story goes down.It turns out that Annie is not entirely of sound mind, and that is almost certainly an understatement. She comes home one day with the latest of his 'Misery' novels and when she discovers that he has killed her off, well, let's just say she is not a little annoyed! I can give no more of the plot away, save to say that this is a thriller of the highest order, and the way Annie's psychosis reveals is performed by Kathy Bates with such masterful skill that she quite literally disappears into the role.Rob Reiner, whose credits include 'The Princess Bride', 'This is Spinal Tap' and King's own 'Stand by Me', at first seems a strange director to helm a horror adaptation, but I rush to assure you he has crafted an incredibly effective thriller. He seems quite at home creating scenes of almost unbearable suspense, but this is not solely to his credit. The casting here is sublime. I have never seen anything Kathy Bates has appeared in, and I believe my lack of knowledge of her work only enhanced my complete belief in her characters state of mind. Other viewers may not be so lucky. There are playful scenes at the beginning of the film which hint that she may not be the full ticket, but then, quite suddenly, we are in no doubt This woman is completely unhinged. Although some who have read the novel may feel that some of the more horrifying things she does to Sheldon have been watered down a bit, I thought the changes worked here. James Caan, who Reiner coaxed out of retirement and has spent virtually his entire career playing tough, virile and energetic characters, spends almost the entire running time of this film in bed. The dichotomy of having such a physical actor playing a helpless victim is absolutely inspired, and he carries his weight right along with Bates. The cat and mouse chemistry between these two is nothing short of fantastic. These are performers at the top of their game. The supporting cast is rounded out by fine actors too. Richard Farnsworth and the criminally underused Frances Sternhagen play the aging local sheriff and his plucky wife, and we are treated to Lauren Bacall as Sheldon's agent, who is dignity itself.A thrilling story by Stephen King, adapted screenplay by William Goldman, direction by Rob Reiner, performers of the highest standard, and a massively effective score all add up to one of the most suspenseful and effective horror-thrillers of recent years. Have fun, I did.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"9 September 2014","score":"","review":" I have long held the belief that most, if not all, of Stephen King's stories start out in his mind as 'what if' scenarios, we all have them, but King takes things to the most extreme conclusions possible and scares the daylights out of us in so doing. With 'Misery', he has given us a story so close to autobiographical horror that you could be forgiven for being duped into thinking it actually happened to him.Paul Sheldon is a talented writer who has been bashing out trashy pulp romances which take place in the early 1900's involving a woman named Misery Chastain. They are wildly successful novels which amass him a fortune, facilitate sending his daughter to the best schools and all the other luxuries that a writer of such success enjoys. But he feels as though he has sold out, he has a burning urge to publish his 'real' book and to be taken more seriously, and in this adaptation of King's novel, we are introduced to him as he finishes his opus while holed up in a remote cabin in Colorado. He then attempts to navigate his car through a blizzard and ends up skidding off the road and landing on a snowy bank, upside down. A figure appears and carries him out of the snowed in vehicle. This figure, we soon learn, is Annie Wilkes, and she is his self-proclaimed 'number one fan'. She also happens to be a nurse, and begins the long process of treating his injuries and nursing him back to health in her home. She tells him she has called a doctor and been given what seems fairly reasonable advice about keeping him there until the weather clears if she is able to take care of him herself. I assure you that sharing these plot details gives nothing away, they are merely set-up for the very dark path the story goes down.It turns out that Annie is not entirely of sound mind, and that is almost certainly an understatement. She comes home one day with the latest of his 'Misery' novels and when she discovers that he has killed her off, well, let's just say she is not a little annoyed! I can give no more of the plot away, save to say that this is a thriller of the highest order, and the way Annie's psychosis reveals is performed by Kathy Bates with such masterful skill that she quite literally disappears into the role.Rob Reiner, whose credits include 'The Princess Bride', 'This is Spinal Tap' and King's own 'Stand by Me', at first seems a strange director to helm a horror adaptation, but I rush to assure you he has crafted an incredibly effective thriller. He seems quite at home creating scenes of almost unbearable suspense, but this is not solely to his credit. The casting here is sublime. I have never seen anything Kathy Bates has appeared in, and I believe my lack of knowledge of her work only enhanced my complete belief in her characters state of mind. Other viewers may not be so lucky.

It would seem at first to be basically a one joke comedy - take an Italian American and drop him into the deep South - but it's developed in an entertaining way and has some real heart and charm going for it - although it does go on a bit long.Pesci stars in the tailor-made role of Vinny Gambini, a so-called lawyer who needed six tries in order to pass the bar exam. He's thrust into the unlikely position of defending his college age cousin Bill (Ralph Macchio) when Bill and his buddy Stan (Mitchell Whitfield) are accused of murdering the clerk at a convenience store. With his fiancée Mona Lisa Vito (a radiant Tomei) in tow, Vinny finds adjusting to life in the South - and adhering to the strict procedures of its courts - to be a struggle.Pesci and the Oscar winning Tomei are lots of fun to watch, and have fine chemistry with each other. They receive fine support from a well chosen bunch of actors. Macchio and Whitfield don't have much to do once Pesci enters the picture, but prove to be reasonably likable.

Then I let it sink in, and I realised that it was phenomenal, and I had to watch it again, and again, and again.The first version that I watched was the one featuring Deckard's voice-over, Rick Deckard being the world-weary detective played by a smooth Harrison Ford, which is not favoured by film purists, but works for me as it links it to the film noir genre. The version without the voice-over is just as good, but it does fill in some richer details and lends the proceedings more of a hard-boiled feel.Mention must be made of the scintillating Vangelis soundtrack, the use of the electronic instruments clashing with the natural orchestral score mirroring the struggle between natural and synthetic life in the film.The look of Blade Runner is magnificent, owing a large debt to graphic artist Moebius and to the Futurist artistic movement.
