[{"date":"18 July 2006","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Election shows what a person is able to do for winning, have power, and do what she wants. The movie tells the story of a successful teacher, Mr. Mc Callister, who really cares about his students, but hates one of them Tracy Flick. After Tracy postulates for president, Mr. M presents another student for president Paul Metzler. After this, Paul's sister, Tammy, postulates for president too. That's because she wants to revenge from Paul since he's dating Lisa, the girl that Tammy loves. So, what started as a simple election finishes as a real battle; and Mr. Mc Callister life finishes ruin after trying to cheat on his wife, Diane. Great satire about power relations. Great performances by Matthew Broderick as Jim Mc Callister and Reese Witherspoon as the neurotic Tracy Flick (She deserved a nomination to the Golden Globe as Best Actress in a movie Comedy\/ Musical in 2000 for this role). This movie is a total must see, so don't miss it! Score 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 July 2006","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Election shows what a person is able to do for winning, have power, and do what she wants.
