[{"date":"3 April 2015","score":"","review":" This atmospheric Civil War saga about ferocious guerrilla warfare in the border states of Kansas and Missouri qualifies as another memorable epic from eclectic Asian director Ang Lee. Lee has helmed a variety of films in different settings and eras, among them Sense and Sensibility, Brokeback Mountain, Hulk, The Ice Storm, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and Life of Pi. This complex, multi-gray shaded tale boasts a number of robush performances from a stellar cast featuring Tobey Maguire, Jim Caviezel, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Simon Baker, Jeffrey Wright, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Wilkinson, Skeet Ulrich, and Jewel Kilcher. Jake 'Dutchy' Roedel (Tobey Maguire of Spider-Man) and Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich of Scream) are Missouri natives who ride with the First Missouri Irregulars, notoriously known as the pro-Confederate Bushwhackers. Leading this disheveled, unkempt bunch is sinister Black John (Jim Caviezel of Person of Interest) and murderous Pitt Mackeson (Jonathan Rhys Meyers of The Tudors) who hate the Unionists with a fervor. Riding alongside them too are George Clyde (Simon Baker of Smith) and his African-American sidekick Daniel Holt (Jeffrey Wright of Casino Royale), and these combatants live off the land. The remote action transpires in anonymous woods, hills, valleys, and densely thatched woods. Eat Drink Man Woman scenarist James Schamus has adapted Daniel Woodrell's 1987 novel ''Woe to Live On. Lee and he go to extraordinary lengths to capture the dialects and eccentric linguistic manner of speech like a period western rather than an anachronistic Hollywood shoot'em up with popular dialogue. Ride with the Devil isn't just another Civil War tale. Lee and lenser Frederick Elmes make it look like the wood cut photography from the era. Myers makes a terrific villain, and our hero and he have a dramatic showdown at the end. Lee's gunfights are well staged but never obscenely bloody. The Lawrence raid is especially brutal but realistic unlike the one sanitary version in Quantrill's Raiders. After the raiders have evacuated the town, a youngster finds a drunken raider passed out in a store. He takes his revolver and before the raider can brandish his own gun, the youngster shoots him. This is the kind of movie where realism is stressed, particularly in the scene when Jake has to amputate Jack Bull's arm in their hovel in the middle of the woods. The costuming is as authentic looking as it can be. Genuine Civil War buffs will enjoy this outstanding opus. Ride with the Devil ranks as the best border war adventure on film.

The film opens at dusk where the main characters meet at local hangout Mels Diner to make plans for the night ahead. Steve Bolander played by Ron Howard is set to leave the town the next morning to go to college along with his friend Curt Henderson played by Richard Dreyfus who reveals that he is undecided about going and may spend another year at school. The Other main characters Terry the local nerd and John Milner racing legend and tough guy are sad their friends are leaving town, but are keen to make the most of the last night together. As night falls the characters head off to cruise the streets and the action takes us in and out of the finest collection of hot rods you will ever see in one movie set to the soundtrack of 50s and 60s hits echoing out of car radios as all the kids listen to local radio DJ and urban myth Wolfman Jack. Throughout the movie Steve and Curt wrestle with the decision of whether to leave town for college the next day to study for a better future or stay with their friends and family meeting girlfriends past and present and encountering local cops and Street gangs through the course of the night. Terry picks up local blonde Debbie impressing her with Steves car which he has been left to look after while Steve goes to college trying his best to impress her with lies about how many other cars he owns (he drives a scooter) Whilst cruising the streets John does his best to get himself a date for the night from a car full of girls cruising alongside him on main street, but gets tricked into taking one of the girls little sister Carol played by Mackenzie Phillips . At first John is annoyed but despite being the local tough guy decides to take care of her like she was his own little sister and the on screen relationship between the two characters is superb as John is taunted by out of town trying to take his title of fastest guy in the valley racer Bob Falfa played by Harrison Ford. Some of the kids spin stories on who and where their DJ hero and soundtrack to their lives DJ Wolfman Jack is He blasts that thing out of Mexico, He is black and fly around broadcasting from a plane In reality he broadcasts from a station just outside of town. One of the best scenes of the film is where Curt meets the Wolfman who pretends to be his own assistant rather than reveal his identity. On hearing his struggle of should I stay or go to college Wolfman gives him some advice which ultimately influences Curt's decision. The film culminates in a race between John and Bob Falfa in the early dawn and with Steve and Curt making their respective decisions about going to college. An on screen narrative reveals the fates of the four main characters. I have seen American Graffiti many times first when I was younger than the characters in the movie, but even now at the grand old age of fifty the film absorbs you into the twilight world of hanging out with your friends. The characters are strong and well-crafted and most of us will recognize elements of our own friends past and present amongst them. It's like a night out without leaving the comfort of your own sofa. 5 out of 5 stars.

Robert Rodriguez makes too many mistakes for this to be a timeless giant like Terminator or Die Hard. But because of how good the action and writing are, it is in the same realm of true action masterpieces.Desperado is the bigger-budgeted sequel\/remake of Robert Rodriguez's first film entitled El Mariachi. This is one of those sequels where it might help watching the original one first. Even by watching El Mariachi first, it does not clear up anything flaw that Desperado has.The one and only flaw I have to give this is the poor transition between the two films. El Mariachi is about a talented guitar player (played in that by Carlos Gallardo) who comes to a town in search of work, where he becomes the subject of a huge case of mistaken identity and bears witness to drug lord, Moco, murder his girlfriend, Domino. He shoots El's hand and El shoots and kills him. In this El (now played by Antonio Banderas) seeks vengeance against another drug lord known as Bucho for murdering Domino. Bucho had nothing to do with the first film, and he already got his revenge against Moco, whom he knew was responsible. There's even a flashback scene with Domino and Moco. This unclarity was the main reason why this meant any sort of negativity. The most logical assumption was that Bucho was a high-ranking drug lord just above Moco, But that assumption does not give our hero a truly clear motive for going on a killing spree. This is a revenge story, but the movie never gives any point behind it all.My inference to this is like Hamlet. (This is just what I interpret). After El kills Moco, his hand is maimed, his girlfriend is dead, and he is out of work. He has no other reason to live. Carolina says to him I've heard of you, you kill drug dealers. Given how much longer the character's hair has gotten and how much he's improved in his shooting abilities, it is evident that some time has passed. So El must've gone on a killing spree, getting everybody underneath Bucho. How is this like Hamlet? Hamlet has no reason to live, until he plots to avenge his father's death. Avenging his father's death has given him a reason to stay alive, so he procrastinates actually going through with it. After he gets revenge, he has no other point in living. El is pretty much the same way. If he doesn't go after all of Bucho's men (then Bucho himself) he has no point in living. Revenge has consumed their entire lives, giving new meaning, which they don't want to let go of. Well, this is my interpretation of it anyway!El arrives in a new town in Mexico where he destroys Bucho's goons with the help of his special guitar case. The lack of identity has Bucho paranoid, while El falls in love with bookstore owner, Carolina (Hayak) who works under Bucho. The relationship between Carolina and Bucho is exactly like Domino and Moco. There's a few other details which give this a remake feel. Desperado is a modern-day spaghetti western. Our nameless hero, only known as El Mariachi, battles armies by himself, where clichés are always around. A bunch of guys shoot him at close range with machine guns and miss, but El shoots them once and they die. Although the clichés are noticeable, the action sequences are loud, intense, gory, and awesome. Although this was made long after gunfights became an art form, almost every action scene this has beats many classic action movies. When it comes to violence, I know good from bad and this is full of some of the best. The first time I watched this (before I exactly knew good movies from bad ones) I was blown away. Despite my knowledge in movies growing since then, it still rocks me every time I see this. Although the action is really what makes this, it is not the only redeeming quality. Whenever there is music playing, it fits. There's rock, blues, and Spanish music put in their respective places, making the scenes that much better. The love story between El and Carolina is even pulled off, despite being generic. And Rodriguez constructs each character to a high degree. He is able to do this by creating killer dialogue, including a hilarious joke given by Quentin Tarantino. So even though there is a big gap between this and the first resulting in a shallow general plot, Desperado is a dynamite tribute to spaghetti westerns with fill redemption which will remain one of the best action movies ever.

Hitchcock often used it, as in The 39 Steps. This plot requires us to suspend disbelief, because no one has ever proved his innocence in real life by avoiding the police long enough to find out who really did it and getting evidence to prove it. Stage Fright is a slight variation on this plot. In this case, the suspect's friend tries to hide him from the police long enough to prove the murder was committed by someone else. Once again, no one in real life has ever managed to do that.In a really good movie, like The 39 Steps, suspending disbelief is easy, and we are well rewarded for doing so. But in a mediocre film like Stage Fright, we are only partially engaged in the movie, and thus find ourselves comparing what happens with reality, and being a little put off by the difference. Instead of suspending disbelief, we find ourselves simply disbelieving.Maybe it is just me, but if I were suspected of a crime I did not commit, I would get myself a lawyer and turn myself in to the police. The movie begins with Jonathan telling Eve that Charlotte came over to his apartment with blood on her dress, saying she killed her husband in self-defense during an argument. He says he agreed to help her establish an alibi, and he goes back to her place to get another dress, and while he is there, tries to make it look like a burglary. However, Charlotte's maid shows up, sees him, and is able to identify him to the police. Now, we later find out that this story is a lie. But while I was watching it, taking this story seriously, I thought to myself that I would have simply advised Charlotte to get a lawyer and turn herself in to the police. And if she refused, I would have notified the police anyway.Furthermore, when Jonathan shows up at the theater where Eve, an actress, is in rehearsal, he tells her that the police want him for something he didn't do, and she agrees to help him escape. She should have told Jonathan to get a lawyer and turn himself in to the police. If he refused to do so, she should have notified the police herself.She takes Jonathan to her father's place, where the father agrees to help Eve hide Jonathan. By this time, it will come as no surprise when I say that if I had been Eve's father, I would have told Jonathan to get a lawyer and turn himself in to the police. If Jonathan and Eve refused to go along with this idea, I would have notified the police anyway.Later, we find out that it was Jonathan who killed Charlotte's husband. But that only allows for one more iteration of my general advice. In that case, Charlotte should have gotten a lawyer and gone to the police. Even if she did instigate the murder, as Jonathan claims, she could have denied involvement, and Jonathan would have been the one to go to prison.Now, it might be argued that if any one of these characters had gone to the police, as I say they should have, there would have been no movie. But any movie that is lackluster enough to allow for disbelief, rather than the suspension thereof, is a movie we would have been better off without.

","genre":"Film-Noir, Thriller"},{"date":"3 April 2015","score":"","review":" Like most of David Lynch's movies, Mulholland Drive makes no sense strange things happen for no apparent reason, characters change identities, and by the end it's unclear what you've just spent two and a half hours watching. Once you try to make this movie fit into a neat little box, you've lost the battle. Once you accept that it won't give you the answers you want, however, you will have a great time making up the answers yourself. Mulholland Drive is about whatever you want it to be about; it's like a dream that could be a fantasy or a nightmare, depending on what you bring into it. The plot (if there even is one) follows the weird, twisty paths Lynch is so well-known for a young actress named Betty (Naomi Watts) moves to Hollywood to make it big, and meets an amnesiac named Rita (Laura Harring). She decides to help Rita solve the mystery of her identity, and along the way the two become lovers. Meanwhile, Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux), the director of the movie Betty wants to star in, is strong-armed into casting a certain actress by a shadowy group of mobsters, a mysterious cowboy (Monty Montgomery), and a malevolent dwarf (Michael J. Anderson) in the proverbial smoky back room.Of course, it wouldn't be a Lynch movie if it didn't take a trip through a parallel reality. It turns out that Betty may (or may not) be a failed actress named Diane Selwyn, and that Rita may (or may not) be her far more successful ex-lover Camilla Rhodes, whom Diane pays to have killed (or does she?). There are little vignettes about an incompetent hit man (Mark Pelligrino), a man (Patrick Fischler) whose recurring nightmare is coming true, and a spooky nightclub where everything is prerecorded. They may have nothing to do with the story, or may be very important to it. There are a plethora of fan sites, chat rooms, and even published academic papers debating the meaning, or lack thereof, of this movie. Maybe Betty is Diane's fantasy of a better life, and Rita is her perfect partner - no past, no baggage, existing only to love her. Or maybe both Diane and Betty are figments of Rita's dream. Or maybe, as the emcee of the dreamlike nightclub says, this is all an illusion. I prefer to think of it as one of those Choose Your Own Adventure books the path you choose will determine where you end up.Watts is completely convincing as both a starry-eyed ingénue and a jaded, depressed failure. She plays both parts (or is it the same part?) for keeps. Harring complements her perfectly as both a damsel in distress and a sultry femme fatale. The sex scenes between them would have been exploitative in a lesser movie, but here they're tasteful and serve a purpose; Betty and Rita (or whatever their names are) are looking for someone to be and somewhere to belong, and mistake sex for the answer to those needs. We've all done that.'Mulholland Drive looks, feels and sounds like a distantly remembered dream, the kind that still feels real after you've forgotten what it was about. Composer Angelo Badalamenti contributes his usual sultry, haunting score, and cinematographer Peter Deming gives the movie a bright, Hollywood-style sheen that looks too good to be real, adding to the movie's fantasy quality. Mulholland Drive is not for people who go to movies expecting to arrive at a destination. It might not even be for people who watch movies to enjoy the journey, since it's never clear what kind of journey it is. Mulholland Drive might work best for the kind of person who finds freedom in getting lost. If you're one of those people, Mulholland Drive is a great ride.

Then John leaves the decision of the union in the palm of Joey's parents' hands, giving the whites the superiority that is already evident in the society. Adding to that, John is the 'man', and he is the only one concerned about the problems their union will bring, as he is the caretaker in the couple. Joey being the 'woman' is not concerned, and perhaps also because she is white she does not need to be concerned because things will be taken care of for her. There are many more such examples, but the main thing that makes this movie all go downhill, is the ending, when Matt (Joey's father) silences everyone and tells them how he went through the process of opposing the union to listening to everyone-else's opinion, and finally to his conclusion (based on the mothers' influence), that all that matters is how much they feel for each other. But he comes to this conclusion like he came up with the whole idea by himself.I could go on longer, but let's move on.Oh wait, there's one more. John says to his father, You think of yourself as a coloured man, I just think of myself as a man. Reinforcing hetero-normativity much? It would have been better to say I think of myself as a human. But I don't blame them much for that 'mistake', even in today's world we reinforce this compulsive heterosexuality.The acting was pretty great considering that Spencer Tracy was deathly ill (he passed away 17 days after the movie wrapped). Katherine Hepburn and her niece Katharine Houghton, played their parts well enough, though Hepburn was more of a presence and had a stronger character. Not much is actually known about Houghton's character except that she was always a happy child. This too causes me to wonder what Joey and John have in common that they could be so in love. Sidney Poitier was pretty convincing in his character, though I noticed that he might have had a bit of a lisp, and I'm not sure if that was how he actually spoke or how his character spoke and I'm hoping its the former. If it was the latter&#x85;that just emphasizes the ideology.I read that this film helped other films that included African- Americans, to be main-streamed into the cinema culture, and I am glad that it had a positive impact.

While it did make breakthroughs in cinema at the time it came out, it still follows and reinforces the white patriarchal ideology.John has to be this perfect man, because if he was anything less there would be fault in him and that would make people think of how he might be 'kidnapping' or 'tricking' Joey into marrying him. Then John leaves the decision of the union in the palm of Joey's parents' hands, giving the whites the superiority that is already evident in the society. Adding to that, John is the 'man', and he is the only one concerned about the problems their union will bring, as he is the caretaker in the couple. Joey being the 'woman' is not concerned, and perhaps also because she is white she does not need to be concerned because things will be taken care of for her. There are many more such examples, but the main thing that makes this movie all go downhill, is the ending, when Matt (Joey's father) silences everyone and tells them how he went through the process of opposing the union to listening to everyone-else's opinion, and finally to his conclusion (based on the mothers' influence), that all that matters is how much they feel for each other. But he comes to this conclusion like he came up with the whole idea by himself.I could go on longer, but let's move on.Oh wait, there's one more. John says to his father, You think of yourself as a coloured man, I just think of myself as a man. Reinforcing hetero-normativity much? It would have been better to say I think of myself as a human.

Sure, subtlety isn't the movie's strong suit, but then again, you pretty much know that early on. This is a story that's easy to get sucked into.

It just seems to transport you to a certain 1987 that feels manufactured, but also somehow authentic. There's the sense that this is the world you'd inhabit if you'd just traveled in Gordon Gekko's circles. And it's got its finger on the pulse of the decade's excess, so it feels totally real.

Shot in Technicolor and filmed on location in northern Tanganyika in what is now Tanzania. The story didn't have that epic 'Call to Adventure' feel that it should had. I think, it hurt that director Howard Hawks decided not to use a plot for the movie, instead letting the characters develop and tying it together with Book Ends. The movie plays more like a romantic comedy, than an adventure movie. Most of the film, has John Wayne's animal dealer character, Sean Mercer trying to fight off the sexual advance coming from newbie, animal photographer, Maria D'Alessandro AKA Dallas (Elsa Martinelli) and her non-stop nagging. It's seem a bit odd, for the movie to have a romantic pairing of then, 27-year-old Martinelli with Wayne, a man twice her age. It's also a bit jarring that her character falls immediately attracted to Sean, despite the fact that he treats her brusquely and distrusts her. The love story gets a little creepy, when Sean Mercer find out that other men, are fighting over, Brady de la Court (Michèle Girardon), a colleague's now adult, daughter. After all, most of these men, help raise her. The European actresses that play them were the worst. They come across as very annoying. The rest of the cast are a mixed bag, in acting. Hardy Kruger as Kurt, the German driver, and Chips (Gérard Blain), the French straight shooter, sounds and look like villains, than heroes with their think European accents. Red Buttons as Pockets, the team joker, was pretty fun to watch. I still don't buy him, as a rocket scientist. Not one bit. The sequence with the rocket to capture monkeys is a bit, out-there and comes out of nowhere. Other characters like Luis Francisco Garcia Lopez (Valentin de Vargas) are pretty forgettable. I really forgot that he was in the film. John Wayne was alright as the main lead. It's pretty believable, that he would go to Africa, and go on Safari missions. I just wish, they didn't tied him up, most of the time, with these tiresome romance sub-plots. I was really hoping for more powerful drama and adventure. Something like 1966's Born Free, or 1952's The Snows of Kilimanjaro. Don't get me wrong, the movie does have some good action sequences with real life animals. Call me, nostalgia, but it's just nice to see animals being part of the film, rather than CGI creatures. Hatari is so fascinating to watch, because of that. It's nice to see the big name movie stars work with truly wild animals. It's funny in a way that some scenes had be redubbed to cover up Wayne's swearing at them. It was beautiful shot. Much of the film revolves John Wayne's team, chasing wildlife in jeeps and trucks across the African plains, roping and capturing animals for zoos & circuses. The way that they drive full blast through herds of animal in top speed was intense and somewhat dangerous. The way, the movie shot the chase with the rhino has influence filmmakers for years to come. A good example of this film, influence art is 1993's Jurassic Park. The car chase with the T-Rex kinda mirrors the Rhino scene in this film. One of the lamest action sequences in the film, had to be the scene where Chips shoots a crocodile that is threatening Kurt. The crocodile was just stock footage, and you never once, see the creature on screen with the main actors. As far as we know of, no animals or people were seriously injured, during filming, but there has been stories leak of random animal attacks, such as leopards. While, the movie characters are not, technically poachers, since, they're hunting during the season. There is a lot of things about this movie that today's society might find offensive or look down upon. After all, this movie portrays, an activity that is now, deem illegal in most Africa countries; which is wildlife catching. This procedure is banned today over concerns of exhausting and killing the targeted animals. I can see why, there was a lot of scenes of wildlife animals getting significant disturbances in their natural habitats. The rhino in the end, looks like he was so much pain, and about to pass out. It was a bit disturbing! While, I'm definitely not an animal-rights activist or part of PETA, I see these acts of 'animal-kidnapping' kinda cruel, because it can often affect hunting, breeding and feeding patterns of the animal herd that the wildlife hunters took members from. Thank god, that most zoos, today, only take animals that are injured or neglected. Most of the animals in zoos, are often from breeding or SSP (Species Survival Plan) programs. So you really can't make a movie, like this, today, without some kind of protest. While, I find this movie kinda upsetting, Hatari does have some good scenes with animals that I love. All of the scenes with the three baby elephants was very charming and cute. Even, if you never heard of the movie, Hatari, you probably heard of that famous whimsical tune from by Henry Mancini Baby Elephant Walk that came from this film. Another memorable musical moment is jazz duet of Stephen Foster's Old Folks at Home (Swanee River). Henry Mancini did a good job with the score. While, the music didn't sound anything, close to epic, it did capture the lifestyle of the 1960s where everybody smokes and drink way too much. I just wish, more of a John Barry's Born Free, type of a feel. The humor is a bit dated and cheesy. There were some really funny moments that I kinda like, but some were a bit politically incorrect, such as the black face scene. Overall Hatari is fun movie with some cool animals and beautiful scenery. It's one rare movie that need to be watch. At least, once.

The fourth installment in the franchise looks to kill Jason once and for all, and does away with the 3D gimmick of the previous entry.The film starts off with the aftermath of Friday the 13th Part 3D, showing us how Jason got carted off to the hospital. The big guy doesn't stay down long though, as he's back up and killing people right away. Meanwhile, the Jarvis family, consisting of Pam (mom), Trish (teenage daughter), and Tommy (young boy) has moved into a cabin on Crystal lake, with a group of teens moving in across the street. Jason works his way back to Crystal Lake and one by one, kills each doped-up, sex-crazed teen before finally meeting his match against Trish and Tommy, the wonder twins.Friday the 13th The Final Chapter went back to the seriousness of the first film in the series. Jason is even more violent here, the kills are more gory and just more sadistic this time around. Jason also grunts a few times, as he's killing and being killed, slightly taking him away from being just a killing machine. It's this seriousness that I enjoy about the film, but there are plenty of laughs to be had with a set of actual Double Mint twins, Jimbo being a dead f***, and Ted using his computer to try to help his friend get laid.The teenagers here feel a bit more real here, but are still cannon fodder. The real characters to watch are Tommy and Trish, the brother\/sister team. Tommy makes masks and dabbles in special effects, and Trish is a down to earth sweet girl who ends up being Jason's toughest opponent. Another character, Rob, is the brother of one of the girls from Friday the 13th Part 2. I like this little tidbit for the character, that he's out there to find Jason for killing his sister.As real as the teenagers feel, there is still very little characterization to be found here. I bring this up because slashers like Halloween and Hellraiser were able to get their characters, be it heroes or victims, across in their films. Had the Friday the 13th franchise just slowed down with the kill spots and upped the character development I would have enjoyed it even more.The film takes place directly after Part 3, which I think is great as it puts parts two, three, and four together as long one story happening over a few days. It also helps the idea of these people coming out to Crystal Lake, as everything is happening so fast no one is able to hear about it before they head out and end up getting killed. You have to think back in the day there was no Twitter or Facebook to spread the news quickly, so no one had an idea as to what was going on.Joe Zito did a great job of bringing the creepiness back to the franchise after Part 3D gave it up for its effect. I love Friday the 13th Part 3D, but I also love The Final Chapter because they did their best to make Jason a scary figure and the woods a more dangerous place to be. The music here is solid, with the iconic music returning and Tom Savini coming back to help in the make up department.Overall Friday the 13th The Final Chapter has a lot going for itself. The kills are nice and gory, there's plenty of nudity, and Jason meets his end thanks to a young Tommy Jarvis, who would return in the next two films. Another great score and slick work by Joe Zito means you'll have a great time watching this one.

It's an iconic franchise launched in the 1980's during the height of the slasher genre, and helped write many of the rules that horror movies would follow after it. Sure, Halloween and even Black Christmas started the whole unseen killer era of horror movies, but Friday the 13th really kicked it up a few notches.The story here is easy to wrap your head around, which it needed to be to get to the blood and guts of the movie. The story centers around Alice, the new head counselor, and Steve, the new owner of Camp Crystal Lake. They bring out a number of other counselors to help rebuild the place and get it ready to open. Over the course of three days, one by one each teenager is killed before Steve gets it. Alice is eventually the last one left alive, and ends up meeting Mrs. Voorhees, who explains how her young son Jason drowned there twenty years ago while the teenage counselors made love. This drove her insane, and she set about to kill any teenagers and anyone else that came out to Crystal Lake. The showdown between Alice and Mrs. Voorhees sets up the climax, where Mrs. Voorhees meets her demise via beheading.The look of the movie captures the feeling of being isolated out in the woods, adding to the scariness of the picture. The film moves along at a good pace giving watchers plenty of suspense. With kills every few minutes, you won't get bored watching this one.Who could forget the fantastic score? The creepy stalking music, the famous ki-ki-ki-ki that still sends a chill down my spine works so damn great here. The music is fantastic, and much like it did for Halloween, the music adds to the creepiness of the film.Tom Savini, the master of gore who worked on Dawn of the Dead among other films, really brought it here with the kills. For today's fans, they won't be impressed with the gore, for the time however it was pretty damn shocking. I still winch during the arrow scene, and the final kill of the film memorable.The one complaint I do have is the lack of character development, which won't always be a complaint from me (I swear) in future reviews. Here, however, we really only get to know Mrs. Voorhees and Alice, and we barely get to know them. The other characters are just glossed over here, and are mostly there for fodder. While this would be a normal occurrence for the franchise, there are characters that get plenty of back story and time to develop, just not in this one.This first movie is a toss up for fans thanks to Jason Voorhees, the killer for the majority of the franchise, not being the killer in this one. Spoiler alert for a thirty year old movie, the killer this time around is Jason's mother, Mrs. Voorhees (Jason does make an appearance at the end).Personally, I enjoy the movie even today. While it did bother me that Jason's mother was the killer when I first watched the movie as a kid, I attribute that to having seen the other movies first. I grew up watching the Friday the 13th movies, and this is one of the best in the series.

In fact, there is a great lack of dialogue between Caul and other characters within the film - he talks a lot about himself in a dream sequence, and that is the most information we get directly from him; otherwise, he is the unreliable narrator we see so often in the noir genre.If not connecting with people is unlikable, it gets worse; we learn from a story told by one of Caul's rivals that one job Caul had in the past resulted in the death of three people. The worst part? Caul didn't care about this nasty result - he simply did his job which the client asked for. People are not relevant to him, so why should he care? But he has a second chance with the story of this film; he assumes a woman will be harmed and makes it his responsibility to protect her.

The issue was, and spoiler alert for those that haven't seen the thirty year-old film, the killer in Friday the 13th was Mrs. Voorhees, and she was killed at the end. The issue now is what do you do with the sequel? One idea that was floated around was to make more films with each film having its own story, but this fell through and it's probably for the best.So, the writers decided to bring in Jason, the reason behind the carnage in the first film, back to life. Well, I suppose it really depends on what story you believe. It's never made clear exactly how Jason came to be. If the viewer is to believe Mrs. Voorhees, Jason died in the lake so many years ago. Then again, why would you believe her? She's a nutcase! Anyway, either Jason never died and Mrs. Voorhees flipped her lid anyway, or Jason lived, and watched his mother get killed that night, and decided to get revenge for himself.The only real issue is, if he watched what happened, why didn't he kill Alice, the lead in the first film, at that moment? That's the problem with bringing Jason into the fold, with no concrete reason why, it's hard for viewers to buy his story. At the end of the day, we just have to accept that Jason is here, and he's in for some killing.The film takes place five years after the first, giving Camp Crystal Lake some time to recover. Of course a group of counselors intend to reopen the resort, but instead of going back to the scene of the crime they take up shop a few hundred yards down river. In fact they're so close that people are able to wander into the old stomping ground. Jason, now out for revenge, is there to hack em up one by one.Ginny Field (Amy Steel), our hero of the film, actually lays down some good analysis on Jason, what he would be like if he was still alive, and how he would think like a child even though he'd be an adult. It actually adds some juiciness to the story; sure there are plenty of scares and some good kills, but it's nice to have some steak with that sizzle.The finale is one of my favorites, as we come to find that Jason's kept a keepsake from his mom, almost like a shrine to her. All but two end up dying in the end, but creates some problems heading into the next film. As expected, there's one final jump scare at the end.What a lot of people don't remember about Friday the 13th Part 2 is, its not really that gory. Turns out the MPAA had it's way with the film after the first film was able to get away with so much. I never really noticed how toned down the kills are in this one, so if you're a gore freak, this one really isn't for you. On the flip side, I think, the less gore, the better the chills.Steve Miner cuts a really good pace here, and when the film slows down we get enough story to keep us going, and of course the music is spot on again here. The creepy sounds of Ki-Ki-Ki come back to keep viewers constantly afraid of what's around the corner.To me this is probably the creepiest Friday the 13th in the entire series. We don't have a lot of gore, and Jason is running in this one (not walking) and has a sack with one eye hole for a mask, which is far more realistic then the hockey mask from the third installment.Basically, Jason could be some crazy backwoods hillbilly out in the woods. The less supernatural about the killer, the scarier he is.

It actually adds some juiciness to the story; sure there are plenty of scares and some good kills, but it's nice to have some steak with that sizzle.The finale is one of my favorites, as we come to find that Jason's kept a keepsake from his mom, almost like a shrine to her. All but two end up dying in the end, but creates some problems heading into the next film. As expected, there's one final jump scare at the end.What a lot of people don't remember about Friday the 13th Part 2 is, its not really that gory. Turns out the MPAA had it's way with the film after the first film was able to get away with so much. I never really noticed how toned down the kills are in this one, so if you're a gore freak, this one really isn't for you. On the flip side, I think, the less gore, the better the chills.Steve Miner cuts a really good pace here, and when the film slows down we get enough story to keep us going, and of course the music is spot on again here. The creepy sounds of Ki-Ki-Ki come back to keep viewers constantly afraid of what's around the corner.To me this is probably the creepiest Friday the 13th in the entire series. We don't have a lot of gore, and Jason is running in this one (not walking) and has a sack with one eye hole for a mask, which is far more realistic then the hockey mask from the third installment.Basically, Jason could be some crazy backwoods hillbilly out in the woods. The less supernatural about the killer, the scarier he is. Friday the 13th Part 2 is a great follow up to the first film, even if it introduces a problem with Jason returning from his supposed grave in the first film. Worth a watch for sure.

One of its good points is that there's some really enjoyable action scenes in the later half which is really quite fun as it really starts here with the policeman stepfather's resurrection. That brings along with it the rather enjoyable aspects such as the slow realization of his degenerative condition, the more violent and overt displays of aggression towards the rest of the family and finally the culmination of everything in the house-chase and resulting car-chase which is all really enjoyable and sets up the rest of the action later on. From the brawl in the house to the confrontation in the burning attic, these scenes are all rather fun and exciting and really make the best points for this one which is all pretty much found in the final half. Along with the blood and gore present throughout this, these are the film's good points which aren't enough to really overcome the various flaws within this. Among the more noticeable problems is the utterly ridiculous manner of accepting the locations powers and effects on everyone as the reaction to everything here is completely arbitrary. It's treated as if the reappearance of people who you have a personal hand in killing being up and acting as if nothing happened is a normal, everyday occurrence in town which doesn't generate any kind of special reaction or builds any suspense at all. That really affects the power of this pretty significantly as well as undermining the whole experience by keeping this one so relaxed about this very disturbing tactic in the film, as if it's not a big deal at all. That also shows up in the unbelievable manner of how those who interact with the resurrected as despite gaping and oozing wounds, a lack of life-like skin or eye-color and permanent cold skin no one catches on at all. The last flaw here is the actions within the finale, as the decision to resurrect the individual is quite illogical, the behavior of being supportive and on their side becomes quite troubling and then how easily this is abandoned makes this all quite confusing and flawed.

But not only has this film have great action sequences but it also has good characters besides Schwarzenegger's Dutch, but also like the silent and mysterious Billy (Sonny Landham), the tough mini-gun commando, Blain (Jesse Ventura) and the psychotic Mac (Bill Duke) and of course the deadly hunter alien (Kevin Peter Hall, RIP).

However not everything about A New Beginning is bad, it just takes some understanding to accept and appreciate the film.We start off meeting Tommy Jarvis, who we first met in the previous film as a kid played by Corey Feldman. Now Tommy is a teenager and headed to a halfway house out in the country. His mom and sister are dead (even though his sister survived the last film). Upon reaching the halfway house we meet the other troubled kids there. Joey is the fat one, who's not only got an eating disorder but is slightly mentally challenged. Victor is the loose cannon who can't control his temper, Violet just seems to like punk music (there's no reason given why she's here). There's a few others, but it's hard to tell why they're at the house and it's never explained. Whatever.Not long after Tommy shows up, Victor hacks Joey to pieces with an ax (because why not give weapons to teenagers with issues) and is taken away by the cops. Tommy keeps hallucinating that Jason is there, seeing him in his room and outside. More of the teens wind up dead, dropping like flies every few minutes. The local Sheriff suspects it's Jason Voorhees, but that's refuted by the mayor who claims Jason was cremated (which would cause some confusion for the next film).More and more bodies pile up until we're down to Tommy, Reggie (a young boy who was at the house to visit his grandfather) and Pam who helps run the facility. The three of them face off with Jason, taking their hits before dropping him onto a piece of farm equipment that is basically a bed of spikes. It's at this point we find out that Jason was Roy, an ambulance driver seen earlier in the film and also Joey's dad. The film ends on a cliffhanger, with Tommy wearing the hockey mask and ready to kill Pam.So let's tackle the biggest complaint people have with the film that Jason is not the killer. Okay, I get it, after three films you wanted Jason to be doing the killing. Let me stop you right there though, the first Friday the 13th film didn't have Jason doing the killing. Jason's mom, Mrs. Voorhees was doing all of the killing, because the camp counselors let Jason drown. Here, Roy loses his mind and starts killing because the people at the house let Joey get hacked to pieces. If anything, Friday the 13th A New Beginning is a remake of Friday the 13th. So yeah&#x85;put that in your hater pipe and smoke it.The kills come swiftly here, every ten minutes or so there's a death. This was a mandate handed down by the producers. This in turn meant that they needed more cannon fodder, so more characters were added. Too many if you ask me. This film has the highest body count in the series and it shows. Random extra characters are introduced and promptly killed off, like the greasers who have about seven minutes of screen time and then die, and they appear nowhere else in the film. The orderly and his date, also share about the same amount of time on-screen before eating it. I get they wanted to up the gore and have more bodies, but it really slows down the film and adds very little.Danny Steinmann does a decent job as director considering he'd done little directing before this. Of course the characters are for the most part under developed, while Tommy, the lead of the film, fails to the same fate. I wish they had put more time into Tommy's character, give us a reason to either suspect him as the killer or root for him to get over his problems and put an end to this killing spree. Neither is done, as you never suspect him nor are you relieved when he finally shows up at the end.The setting is a bit off, as it's a halfway house in the country with no rules. That seems to be an odd way of helping those that have problems. Again, it's hard to tell why half of these kids are here, some are obvious, like Victor and Joey. I liked seeing Violet doing the robot before she gets killed, only because people forget how cool the robot was.Overall people have hated on A New Beginning for twenty plus years. Real fans of the series however realize the film is more of the same from the franchise, and enjoy it like any other film. I get the argument that it's not really Jason doing the killing, but he didn't do the killing in the first film either and it was just as good. A New Beginning isn't great, and I wouldn't put it in my top ten horror movies, but it's still a solid offering and better than some of the later Friday the 13th films.
