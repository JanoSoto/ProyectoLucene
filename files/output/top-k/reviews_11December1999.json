From the beginning mind boggling shot (the whole thing with the nose) to the superb ending (and i don't just mean the twist), this film goes from strength to strength. Cinematically, i don't think i have seen a film that utilises the camera as amazingly as this one.Also, the comments it makes on loss of male identity, commercialism and consumerism are so poignant that you will be psycho-analysing your freinds and their roles in society for at least a week after you've watched the film. WARNING you may feel like hitting something after seeing it. GRRR!!!  ","genre":null},{"date":"11 December 1999","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Holy crap!
