First of all, I'd like to point out that the quote mentions quicksilver, which of course is Mercury. The Mercury Players are the stars of this film and Citizen Kane --- coincidence?There are at least 2 books that deal with the relative merits of film adaptations of novels -- which is better, the novel or the film? Both of these books that I read seem to think that the film of Magnificent Ambersons is better than Tarkington's novel. I read the novel -- it is not written in a wordy old-fashioned style typical of novels of its day (1918) -- it's a good read by today's standards -- even a great read -- I'd say that the novel and the film are co-equals in terms of artistic excellence. Factory soot and general air pollution is a prominent theme in the novel, as in 2 other novels by Booth Tarkington (he collected the 3 novels together in one volume under the collective title Growth). Tarkington was also concerned about what we today call urban sprawl.In both the film and novel, the name of Georgie's horse is mentioned several times -- Pendennis -- the title character of a 1850 novel by William Makepeace Thackery (who also wrote Vanity Fair) -- Pendennis is a novel about snobbery (and surely Georgie is also a snob). For what it's worth, in my opinion, Tim Holt's portrayal of Georgie is just fine. And isn't it ironic that Tim Holt, son of cowboy actor Jack Holt, returned to the family business of B-Westerns (along with his sister Jennifer) after he turned in good performances in 2 of the greatest films ever made (his other major role was in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre -- he also had a minor role in Stagecoach)?Read the novel if you want a full explanation of how the Amberson family lost its fortune. Also, the film mentions that Aunt Fanny lost her money by investing in a headlight company -- the novel makes clear that this company is NOT connected with Eugene's automobile company. Finally, as another reviewer pointed out, the non-Wellesian tacked-on studio ending for the film, though abrupt, is fairly faithful to the novel. I, too, wish I could see the 53 or 55 or 58 minutes of Welles's footage discarded by the studio, but I am not prepared to heap abuse or ridicule on the studio ending.When A&E cable network commissioned a remake of Welles's film, it's too bad the expanded 150-minute running time was not better used to clarify the plot. The same thing happened when TV produced a miniseries remake of The Long Hot Summer, loosely based on Faulkner's Snopes Trilogy (especially, the first novel, The Hamlet) -- instead of restoring some of what's in the novels, the TV writers were asked to confine themselves to expanding the original screenplay.

Frenzy, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, gives us one of the last glimpses into the mind of one of our greatest cinematic geniuses. While his style in this film is a bit different than what you may expect from seeing his earlier films, Frenzy is still a complete and utter Hitchcockian thriller. From the opening shot, to the uncanny cameo, to the swiftly tilting plot, anyone who has witnessed Hitchcock at his best will be able to see the mastery behind this film. The acting is superb and only helps to accentuate the brilliant eye that Hitchcock had to give us just what we came asking for. While he gives us a story that we may all be familiar with, it is the way in which he tells the story that makes Frenzy worth mentioning to friends and family.The genius about this film is that instead of having your usual murder mystery that Hollywood has reproduced a thousand times, Hitchcock balances this story between our hero and villain. In complete Hitchcock form, he tells us, the audience, whom the murderer is right from the beginning so that we do not sit in our seats trying to bend our minds over whom it truly is doing this evil deed. He does this so that we can focus on the insanity of being the wrong man and the sadistic pleasure the other finds from not being in the police spotlight. He does this will sheer delight and the brilliance of a true filmmaker. What is continually enthralling about this is that we, the audience, are still kept on the edge of our seat. We know who the murderer is, we know why he is doing this, yet we still bite our nails and wonder how it will turn out. You do not see films of this caliber any more. Even at the end, Hitchcock has us guessing what will happen next up until the final credits roll. He does not allow us a break, and for that I am grateful.There were some incredible scenes in this film that left a lasting impression on me as well as my idea of film. For example, the way that Hitchcock filmed the rape scene early in the film was shocking, powerful, and very risky for its time. Here we have a man, repeating the same monstrous words to a woman that he has forced himself on, while she repeats the inner voice inside of her out towards us. It sent a shiver down my spine like no other scene of this nature had. It was graphic, yet honest. It was raw, yet somehow cinematic ally intense. I had never seen a scene filmed like this in the past, so this was a sheer bold and stunning. Another scene that literally caught my eye was the moment when Babs leaves the bar, pauses, and right behind her is Rusk. The irony was killing me. It was so macabre that you couldn't help but laugh at the situation that was about to unfold. I felt that same way when I was watching Rusk with the potato sack. While I did think the length of the scene was a bit too much and at times a bit over-dramatic, I did see why Hitchcock left it in there. He was literally giving you the light side of serial killing, the parts that should perhaps make you smile, but instead they have this deeply rooted dark underbelly that keeps your hands firmly in front of your eyes or behind a pillow. It is frightening to think how Hitchcock could have changed the face of cinema today if he were alive to wave his magic wand. It would be powerful.Outside of the brilliant man behind the camera and the fascinating way to tell an age old story, I thought that the actors did a decent job with what they were handed. While I think that the Golden Globe was mostly for Hitchcock himself, I was pleasantly surprised with Jon Finch's character portrayal and the suave coolness of Barry Foster. I thought that both of these actors did an exceptional job of counterbalancing the story. One was truly evil, while the other just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Both controlled their roles with ease, but then again, with Hitchcock behind the camera, a story like this should just fall into place.While I have spoken very highly of this film, there were some small moments where I just felt Hitchcock could have gone further, pulled back, or just found the point instead of rummaging around a potato truck for it. That scene in particular did it for me. It was way too long and a bit too humorous for my liking. Also, the nudity was not needed in this film. I don't remember seeing a Hitchcock film with so much nudity, and I understand he was just trying to keep his films fresh for the 70s, but something can be said for style and class, and I felt there was just a bit of both lacking from this film. Outside of these small bits, the rest was flawless. I especially loved the court scene where all we had to rely on was the emotions of the convicted. Finally, who couldn't laugh at the fact that the only one to mess up the life of Blaney, to see the truth blurred and hypothetical, was the secretary that wore glasses. Ahh, it was good to see that Hitchcock has not forgotten all of his roots.Overall, this was a very dark and disturbing picture that has captured the essence of originality and suspense. You need to see this film more than once to fully absorb everything that Hitchcock has to offer.Grade **** out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"16 March 2005","score":"9 out of 13 people found the following review useful","review":" For being developed and released in the year 1972, this is a very impressive film.

While I think that the Golden Globe was mostly for Hitchcock himself, I was pleasantly surprised with Jon Finch's character portrayal and the suave coolness of Barry Foster. I thought that both of these actors did an exceptional job of counterbalancing the story. One was truly evil, while the other just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Both controlled their roles with ease, but then again, with Hitchcock behind the camera, a story like this should just fall into place.While I have spoken very highly of this film, there were some small moments where I just felt Hitchcock could have gone further, pulled back, or just found the point instead of rummaging around a potato truck for it. That scene in particular did it for me. It was way too long and a bit too humorous for my liking. Also, the nudity was not needed in this film. I don't remember seeing a Hitchcock film with so much nudity, and I understand he was just trying to keep his films fresh for the 70s, but something can be said for style and class, and I felt there was just a bit of both lacking from this film. Outside of these small bits, the rest was flawless. I especially loved the court scene where all we had to rely on was the emotions of the convicted. Finally, who couldn't laugh at the fact that the only one to mess up the life of Blaney, to see the truth blurred and hypothetical, was the secretary that wore glasses. Ahh, it was good to see that Hitchcock has not forgotten all of his roots.Overall, this was a very dark and disturbing picture that has captured the essence of originality and suspense. You need to see this film more than once to fully absorb everything that Hitchcock has to offer.Grade **** out of ***** ","genre":"Thriller"},{"date":"16 March 2005","score":"9 out of 13 people found the following review useful","review":" For being developed and released in the year 1972, this is a very impressive film. Frenzy, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, gives us one of the last glimpses into the mind of one of our greatest cinematic geniuses. While his style in this film is a bit different than what you may expect from seeing his earlier films, Frenzy is still a complete and utter Hitchcockian thriller. From the opening shot, to the uncanny cameo, to the swiftly tilting plot, anyone who has witnessed Hitchcock at his best will be able to see the mastery behind this film. The acting is superb and only helps to accentuate the brilliant eye that Hitchcock had to give us just what we came asking for. While he gives us a story that we may all be familiar with, it is the way in which he tells the story that makes Frenzy worth mentioning to friends and family.The genius about this film is that instead of having your usual murder mystery that Hollywood has reproduced a thousand times, Hitchcock balances this story between our hero and villain. In complete Hitchcock form, he tells us, the audience, whom the murderer is right from the beginning so that we do not sit in our seats trying to bend our minds over whom it truly is doing this evil deed. He does this so that we can focus on the insanity of being the wrong man and the sadistic pleasure the other finds from not being in the police spotlight. He does this will sheer delight and the brilliance of a true filmmaker. What is continually enthralling about this is that we, the audience, are still kept on the edge of our seat. We know who the murderer is, we know why he is doing this, yet we still bite our nails and wonder how it will turn out. You do not see films of this caliber any more. Even at the end, Hitchcock has us guessing what will happen next up until the final credits roll. He does not allow us a break, and for that I am grateful.There were some incredible scenes in this film that left a lasting impression on me as well as my idea of film. For example, the way that Hitchcock filmed the rape scene early in the film was shocking, powerful, and very risky for its time. Here we have a man, repeating the same monstrous words to a woman that he has forced himself on, while she repeats the inner voice inside of her out towards us. It sent a shiver down my spine like no other scene of this nature had. It was graphic, yet honest. It was raw, yet somehow cinematic ally intense. I had never seen a scene filmed like this in the past, so this was a sheer bold and stunning. Another scene that literally caught my eye was the moment when Babs leaves the bar, pauses, and right behind her is Rusk. The irony was killing me. It was so macabre that you couldn't help but laugh at the situation that was about to unfold. I felt that same way when I was watching Rusk with the potato sack. While I did think the length of the scene was a bit too much and at times a bit over-dramatic, I did see why Hitchcock left it in there. He was literally giving you the light side of serial killing, the parts that should perhaps make you smile, but instead they have this deeply rooted dark underbelly that keeps your hands firmly in front of your eyes or behind a pillow. It is frightening to think how Hitchcock could have changed the face of cinema today if he were alive to wave his magic wand.

Unfortunately I started watching them in the wrong order. I actually watched them in the order 2,1,4,3. Bizarre I know, but I did enjoy them still, and eventually managed to watch them in order and loved them even more. I can see why they're considered possibly the best buddy movies and are up there with the best action movies as well. I have watched them over and over again through the years and they never get boring. However, this one is definitely my favourite. I watched it today and felt I had to post my views here and highly recommend it to all you action fans out there, but I bet you've probably already seen it anyway.I don't want to get into the plot, although it is pretty interesting. I really want to talk about the action and humour, which is sensational throughout it and keeps the movie fast moving and it never gets boring. All the characters from the first 3 films are back, which is great as you very rarely see this today in franchises of this size and all of them do their part. These include Gibson, Glover, Pesci (who're all absolutely hilarious still and in this one they're definitely at their funniest), Russo, The Captain (not sure of the actor) and Glover's family, who're all still played by the same actors. A well done to bringing them all back to Director Richard Donner, who has helmed all 4 movies which has been a big key to it success. Another great character added here though is Chris Rock's who was the funniest in the movie. He has some great lines, but I won't spoil them for you though. Pesci in particular matches him though as his constant okay, okay, okay fast talking self.But the focal point here has to be the action and on an entertainment scale this movie blows it right out the window. When I commented on The Rock I said it was the best action movie ever, but I think today having watched this for the first time in a while, it may have overtaken it. The action is sensational and comes thick and fast from the opening scene to the climax. These are Gibson and Glover taking on an armoured guy with a flame thrower which ends in a bang, a fight on a huge ship followed by a great explosion, a chase on foot through Chinatown, A fight inside Glover's home which leads to the highlight of the movie- a terrific chase across a freeway, and finally a great shootout and showdown between Gibson, Glover and Jet Li whose also great as the villain.These action sequences are the best in the series, but the great thing about this movie is, it doesn't focus on action all the time and manages to fit in a decent plot, great humour and more importantly, the character development between the leads; Gibson and Glover. I also enjoyed the warm and friendly family scenes inside Glover's house involving the Chinese family and the relationship development between Gibson and Russo. I especially enjoyed the very end in the hospital. In fact there isun't one scene from this movie I would cut. Its perfect and is definitely the best in the series, which is a huge surprise and rarity because not only is it a sequel, its the third sequel! So, overall this movie is perfect and I'd be more than happy to see a Lethal Weapon 5 some day if it ever materialises because I love all 4 films, but this one especially. It is definitely one of my all time favourite action movies and up there with my favourite movies ever made. If your an action fan who hasn't seen this get out there and buy it now.

It gets worse when a tropical storm has been reported as heading for the island, computer programmer Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) uses this opportunity, he has been bribed by a corporate rival to steal dinosaur embryos, he deactivates security systems to gain access to them and escape, in doing this the guests in the cars come to a stop, and fences are failing all over the park. This leads to this escape of the most dangerous of the dinosaurs in Jurassic Psrk, the Tyranosaurus Rex, Gennaro is devoured, Malcolm is badly injured, and Tim is pushed off the embankment whilst in the car into a tree, but he and Lex are safe and rescued, and they and Grant climb into another tree to hide until the morning, Nedry meanwhile trying to get to the dock is killed by the Dilophosaurus, and the embryos he collected are lost in the mud.

While the three of them encounter a herd of Gallimimus, and avoid the T. Rex again, Hammond insists that to get security and communication systems working again they should reboot the system, reluctant chief engineer Ray Arnold (Samuel L. Jackson) agrees, and it does work, he heads for the maintenance shed to complete the rebooting process. Arnold does not return after some time, so Sattler and Muldoon head out, they find that the shutdown has allowed the escape of the other dangerous dinosaurs, the Velociraptors, Sattler makes it to the shed and using walkie talkie communicates with Hammond and Malcolm to reactivate the power systems, unaware that Grant and the children are climbing an electrocuted fence.

The acting is fine by all the actors in it, but the real stars are of course the dinosaurs, brought to life by both brilliant CGI special effects and models, the story is simple and the action is exciting, and the script is well written when you think about it, it is definitely a film the whole family can enjoy, many sequels have followed, but (besides Jurassic World) they have cannot surpass this original blockbuster, a great science-fiction adventure.

Basically paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) are renowned for studying dinosaur bones, and are invited by the founder and CEO of bioengineering company InGen, John Hammond (Lord Sir Richard Attenborough) to visit, certify and endorse the opening of his newly created theme park on Isla Nublar, an isolated Costa Rican island. Also invited are mathematician and chaos theorist Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero), the guests enter Jurassic Park, and are stunned by the sight of a living breathing dinosaur, a Brachiosaurus, plus two others and a herd of Parasaurolophus in the distance. Hammond takes them to the visitor centre where a laboratory tour explains that dinosaur DNA was extracted from the bodies of mosquitoes found trapped in hardened tree sap, called amber, and the incomplete DNA strains had sequences gaps filled by frog DNA, and to prevent breeding all dinosaurs have been engineered to be female, despite being initially stunned some of the guests question the ethics of bringing extinct (by selection) creatures back to life. The group are joined by Hammond's grandchildren, Tim (Joseph Mazzello and Lex Murphy (Ariana Richards), children being his target audience, to take the tour of Jurassic Park, with Hammond and his team watching from the control room, but it does not go to plan, as dinosaurs including the Dilophosaurus not appearing, and getting out of the controlled Explorer cars they find a sick Triceratops. It gets worse when a tropical storm has been reported as heading for the island, computer programmer Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) uses this opportunity, he has been bribed by a corporate rival to steal dinosaur embryos, he deactivates security systems to gain access to them and escape, in doing this the guests in the cars come to a stop, and fences are failing all over the park. This leads to this escape of the most dangerous of the dinosaurs in Jurassic Psrk, the Tyranosaurus Rex, Gennaro is devoured, Malcolm is badly injured, and Tim is pushed off the embankment whilst in the car into a tree, but he and Lex are safe and rescued, and they and Grant climb into another tree to hide until the morning, Nedry meanwhile trying to get to the dock is killed by the Dilophosaurus, and the embryos he collected are lost in the mud. Sattler and game warden Robert Muldoon (Edge of Darkness's Bob Peck) search for the survivors, only finding Malcolm alive, they narrowly an attack by the T. Rex, during the night Grant and the children get close to a herd of Brachiosaurus, and as morning comes they come across broken shells of hatched dinosaur eggs, Grant concludes that the frogs used to complete DNA sequences must have been West African bullfrogs, which have been known to change sex in a single-sex environment, allowing them to breed. While the three of them encounter a herd of Gallimimus, and avoid the T. Rex again, Hammond insists that to get security and communication systems working again they should reboot the system, reluctant chief engineer Ray Arnold (Samuel L. Jackson) agrees, and it does work, he heads for the maintenance shed to complete the rebooting process. Arnold does not return after some time, so Sattler and Muldoon head out, they find that the shutdown has allowed the escape of the other dangerous dinosaurs, the Velociraptors, Sattler makes it to the shed and using walkie talkie communicates with Hammond and Malcolm to reactivate the power systems, unaware that Grant and the children are climbing an electrocuted fence. Sattler discovers Arnold's severed arm and escapes an attack from a raptor in the shed, Muldoon is killed in a raptor ambush, and Grant and the children make it back to the visitor centre, Grant goes to search for the others, leaving the children inside, but they have two Velociraptors searching for them. Grant, Sattler and the children go the control room, and Lex being a computer hacker is able to restore full power, allowing the group to call for help, they are cornered by two raptors, but escape when the Tyrannosaurus suddenly appears to kill both raptors. In the end Grant voices his intent not to endorse the park, Hammond concurs this decision, and all the survivors board the rescue helicopter and leave the island.

It was a difficult film to watch because the pacing that Egoyan has implemented is unlike any other film that I have seen. His use of the camera to create that uneasy sensation on screen and while watching the film was very impressive. Hoskins gives the performance of his career as this very controlled man with a very dark secret while Elaine Cassidy impressed me with her simplistic portrayal of Felicia. This was a brilliant film, but there were just some scenes and elements that didn't seem to match the rest of the film. The ending in particular was a bit misleading and at times rushed, but everything building up to that point really hit a strong nerve. If you were to define the word thriller, I don't think that you could do it without mentioning this film. Brilliant acting, an interesting use of direction (which worked very well), and a story that allowed itself to be build upon during each scene are just a few of the great moments (that overshadow the poor) in this movie.Felicia's Journey would not have been the powerhouse that it was if it was not for the powerful acting by Bob Hoskins who completely engulfed this character and showed us this rare glimpse of evil humanity. While I am sure that some of it is due in part by Egoyan's direction, but you cannot keep your eyes off Hoskins whenever he is on the screen. He builds his character so well, and bit by bit, that you never can anticipate what will he will say or do next. That is what is brilliant about Hoskins. Normally, when you have a troubled soul like Hilditch you can sometimes guess what he is going to do next. Actors sometimes fall into a pattern of repetition, but with Hoskins it was as if we were watching the final chapter and there were bigger events taking place. He also worked so well with Cassidy that at times I had forgotten that I was watching a film. His ability to be this sinister father figure to this girl was impressive. Hoskins really built this beautiful family dynamic to the film that I never saw coming. Outstanding performances by both that any film connoisseurs should not miss.Taped onto the vintage acting is this deeply engrossing story that pours from the bottle like some freshly corked wine. The simplicity of the story allows the complexity of the characters emerge and be triumphant. The story gives our characters layers upon which we gradually peel away. Hoskins character especially. From the opening scene until the final, I felt as if I was given the whole course, and not just bits and pieces. While Felicia's name does take the title of this film, it is Hoskins whom this story is really about. We learn more about his life, and his struggles than we do with Felicia. Yet, the story does not stop there. I found it quite interesting that Felicia father caused her conflict, while a matriarchal figure challenged Hilditch's perception. I thought that Egoyan was really trying to do more than tell a serial killer story (as the box may reveal) by giving us these strange and strangled family moments. I felt as if this was more a story about family, then it was about the horrors of humanity &#133; or perhaps it was a slice of both. Either way, the story is the foundation to this picture, and for the first time it really worked. So many times we go to the theater expecting to be blown away by a creative and empowering story, but this time it was a polar opposite. The acting is what kept this film high above water, while the story (as simple as it was) only helped build Hoskins and Cassidy further into the world of impressiveness.Finally, there was Egoyan behind the camera doing what he does best. I have seen only one of his other films, Exotica, and he is notorious for building the suspense from behind the camera as well as in front. His choice of panning in the wrong direction, the colors surrounding our characters and the sound of the film hit our nerves before any actors even walk into the picture. This is all coming from Egoyan's mind, which continues to impress me with each film that I view. I cannot wait to see more of his work and to see how well he has developed with each project. You can definitely see the Hitchcock influence that has been imprinted with Egoyan. I finished watching Frenzy (by Hitchcock) right after this film and the similarities were uncanny. Egoyan reminds me of a cross between Hitchcock and von Trier. His bold style makes each film his own, yet he is not afraid to be brutally honest and attributive to the cultural setting. He is a true filmmaker that needs to continue to prove that you don't need millions to create a masterpiece.While I have given credit to everyone, and thing, that deserves it in this film, I must finish this review by saying that this film was not perfection on a stick, but very close. There were some unfinished ends that could have been tied better, and the ending just felt as if there was this outside influence at work that Egoyan was battling. Up until the final twenty minutes of this film, I was thoroughly enjoying what I was seeing, but when the idea of religion was brought in from left field, I felt the final moments were rushed and forced. I needed something just as dramatic, just not so random. Also, I needed some form of conclusion to Felicia's actual journey. Did she find what she was looking for? Overall, I was very impressed with this film.Grade **** out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"16 March 2005","score":"16 out of 25 people found the following review useful","review":" Felicia's Journey was one of those films that I loved, then hated, then liked, then thought was decent.

I would have been able to identify with the banker's suffering even more with more believable, American villains rather than ones that seemed calculated to evoke memories of WWII prisoner of war camps.

Overall I was impressed by what he had done, but I felt some parts of the film didn't quite work. Firstly, although i think Sellers is a great actor and I love him in everything I've seen him in I just couldn't get comfortable with his role here. When reading the book I had a totally different vision of Quilty, so I found it hard to readjust to Seller's performance. Although his acting is great and hilarious as always, it just didn't fit into the plot for me. I thought James Mason was good, and he played the gradual disintegration of Humbert Humbert with an intensity which i enjoyed. However, i felt that the film did not reveal as much of his character as the novel portrays. The name Humbert Humbert suggests two sides to his nature, and I felt that too much emphasis was placed on his suave and intelligent side, and not enough time was devoted to his burning desire and passion for Lolita. I particularly missed one of my favourite lines that was not used in film, 'Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.' Although i haven't seen the film in a long time, I think Jeremy Irons from the 1997 version is a much better actor for the role.Sue Lyon made a great Lolita, although she did tremble on the line between looking young enough for the role and looking too old for it. Still, there were times in the film where she looked so young the odious nature of Humbert's act really struck me. Speaking of this, I felt the film skipped past too much of what really went on between Humbert and Lolita. Although Nabokov similarly leaves this to the reader's imagination, I thought a little more could have been done to stress the nature of Humbert and Lolita's relationship.Shelley Winters was brilliant, and her acting added so much to the character of Charlotte Haze. I thought she was wonderful; she really fleshed the character out.Overall, I did enjoy watching this film despite the small niggles I had with it, but I view it as something separate to the novel. In this way it's a more enjoyable experience. I'm looking forward to seeing the 1997 version of the film again (I saw it once years ago!), as I think it is a movie that will benefit much more having been made in a time of a more permissive society, allowing more creative freedom in what can be shown.

That's for good reason, of course, because it's a sublime piece of cinema; but surely Laura deserves just as much of that praise. Simply put, the film is perfection and I dare anyone to argue otherwise. The acting, direction, script, morals; everything are absolutely spot on, and impossible to pick a fault with. The film works principally on two levels; on one level, it's technically stunning, with all those assets mentioned featuring heavily and to great effect, and on the other level; it's a potent love story, one that takes a premise and builds it into what is possibly the most powerful and brilliant expose of love that cinema has ever seen. Many films get one of these two things right to a great degree, but Laura manages both exceptionally - and that is a rare thing. The plot follows the murder of a very beautiful woman who seemingly has admirers coming out of her ears. She's so stunning, in fact, that she manages to gain another one in death; as Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews), the detective on the case falls for the girl who's murder he is investigating.Laura will be remembered by many for featuring one of the most shocking and surprising plot twists of all time. The twist can easily be guessed before the film, and it's this blatant edge that allows it to be such a surprise. Ace director Otto Preminger captures that film noir atmosphere that would go on to become the staple of the genre, and he captures it to such an extent that in the fifteen years or so that film noir would go on after the release of this film; it would never be bettered. The acting from all concerned is immense, and obviously Gene Tierney sticks out the most as title character. She is matched brilliantly by Dana Andrews, who brings life and believability to his character brilliantly. The cast is finally topped off by exuberant support performances from Clifton Webb and, of course, the master of the macabre; Vincent Price! This film marks an important milestone in the great horror icon's career as shortly before being cast in this movie, he was set to join the army - and I dread to think what a loss that would have resulted in for my beloved horror genre. So kudos to Otto Preminger for that casting decision! Not giving this film full marks is a completely ludicrous idea. If you see this film and deduce that it is anything less than absolutely brilliant, you seriously need to reconsider your status as a film fan.

And now in THE STEPFORD WIVES, he does an almost by-the-numbers repeat of his previous novel (sans the supernatural in favor for extremely subtle science fiction overtones) and switches not only location but divides the genders, in which the men, viewed mainly as piggish dorks, are behind some shady business and are somehow married to these knockout (yet oddly vacant) hausfraus whose only motive in life seem to be discussing fabric softeners, cleaning at all time, and then cleaning some more.I presume most people, if not all unless they have been living under a rock or Siberia, will be acquainted with the plot, which in the novel is very short yet covers a period of four months, and in the movie moves along a little too slowly in the beginning but later starts to gather quiet force in a tightening noose, so I won't detail it here because to do so would not only be redundant but could not be done without revealing an important aspect of the movie. While the novel basically drops the secret midway by means of a poem Joanna Eberhart writes, the movie takes its time to let us in on the conspiracy which at the end reveals itself in that final, horrifying sequence at the Men's Association. And by then we've been outraged by the women's blighted feminism, and infuriated at the men who are little more than dangerous cavemen hiding behind technology and deceptive appearances.I don't know if Levin, in creating his story, was looking for satire or horror but he manages to (again) blend elements of the two in a short yet unforgettable book.

The gore is plentiful but laughable, the dialogue and script ridiculous, acting and production values are close to rock bottom. The best thing you can say about it is that it's short.However, there must be some redeeming value to it, because I did watch the whole thing. I shut off Anchorman after 30 deadening minutes.

It's hard to believe that II ever made it to theaters. Truly a frightening thought.

I imagine that he spent more time directing her than all the other cast members combined. Manz's Linda, like Scout in To Kill a Mockingbird, is both narrator and character in the story. But Malick takes this even further as she also serves the same off-screen narrator function that Orsen Welles did in The Magnificent Ambersons; providing more of a parallel commentary than just a narration. And like Ambersons, the authority of her commentary is sometimes challenged by the images on the screen. This makes the tone and content of her narration an element of the film's message and significance, not just the definitions of them found in TKM.Basically the entire story is told by her, speaking sometime after the events have taken place and commenting about them as they were seen from her naïve perspective at the time. Manz was 16 when the film was made, convincingly playing a character of about 12. Her face and voice combine to present a child who has already experienced and survived at lot. She has seen the worst and it has made her resigned and emotionless; seemingly beyond surprise. But her face has a subtle expressiveness that visually communicates a hidden depth of feeling, and the attentive viewer understands that rather than being mired in despair she was full of wonder at the things she was then experiencing.As someone commented earlier, watch for how the four principal characters represent the four elements; earth (Linda), water (Abby), fire (Bill), and wind (the farmer), with Earth the least transitory and the one that remains at the end. And watch how Linda follows or chases after everyone to whom she becomes close-even in the closing scene with her new friend.Just understand, as you watch Days of Heaven, that it is the story of Linda and that the actions of the three adult characters (who are actually on-screen more than Linda) are significant only for the impact on her; and are presented from her subjective, somewhat distanced and detached perspective.The film inspired amazing comments by Roger EbertChildren know that adults can be seized with sudden passions for one another, but children are concerned primarily with how these passions affect themselves Am I more or less secure, more or less loved, because there has been this emotional realignment among the adults who form my world? This is a movie made by a man who knew how something felt, and found a way to evoke it in us. That feeling is how a child feels when it lives precariously, and then is delivered into security and joy, and then has it all taken away again--and blinks away the tears and says it doesn't hurt.
