For most of my life there has been only one movie to even speak of when it came to this subject - The Godfather Epic. For those of you not familiar with it it was the Godfather Parts I and II edited in chronological order.. I've seen it several times and to this day my Dad still thinks that this is the best mob story ever told..But With all due respect..I just watched Goodfellas for the 12th time and - There is no doubt in my mind that Goodfellas is the best mob movie ever made..The story starts off during the Golden Age of Organizied Crime 1955 Brooklyn NY. A young Henry Hill is intrigued by the mob way of life - and let's be honest - why not !?.. They have it all - respect, wealth, and power.. Everything about the movie at this point is made to romance you about the era.. The music, the cinematography, work so well together..its quite rare that a film can make you actually feel a part of it.. Goodfellas succeeds at this.. We meet all sorts of characters who add to the environment. Henry as he learns the ropes also decribes to the viewer how it works.. And just about the time your ready to stand-up and declare you wanna be a wiseguy When things are going so good -Goodfellas smacks you right in the face and says - Whaddasamatta with you..The deceit, the lying, the overall evil that consumes these people is staggering.. The movie shows that in the mob there is no love, no loyality, no care - even amonst themselves.. The biggest mistake the mob made was to include drugs into its business.Goodfellas exceeds the Godfather because of the feeling of inclusion you feel when watching it, it surrounds you and makes you feel like a part of the film.. I felt it's direction, and cinematography, and editing style are second to none.. This is Scorese and DeNiro's best film together..Raging Bull was great too but Casino was pale over this one -  Liotta was wonderful although he hasnt done much since.. and Pesci's best is My Cousin Vinny but his Tommy is very good - deserving of the Oscar that year - even though you wouldnt want to know him.If your a fan of mob storys in general see if you can spot two Sopranos guys in the movie !

If you don't want to know the ending, don't read on!!!This must be one of the most positive movies I have seen in the last couple of years. LIFE DOES NOT SUCK if you put some effort into it.This bittersweet story about a teacher challenging 7th graders to change the world, resulting in a little kid making up a system to make the world a little better. When somebody does something for you totally unselfish you have to pay it forward to three other complete strangers. This is the basic storyline for the movie.The acting was absolutely marvelous. Kevin Spacey cannot play a bad role, I am convinced of that. After his staggering display of suburban family life in American Beauty he returns as the tormented teacher Eugene Simonet who himself is afraid to change the world because he feels secure in his little world. The change in his life arrives in the form of Arlene McKinney (Helen Hunt), mother of the little boy who is a closet drunk and is unsure what life will become in the future, her life changes as well when she meets Eugene through the works of her son Trevor (Haley Joel Osment). Trevor just wants a steady home without his drinking father being a part of it.The primary cast (Spacey, Hunt, Osment) are very very good in this movie. They really move you and make you fell for them. Staggering to say the least. Osment delivers another powerhouse performance after his exquisite portrayal of the plagued boy in The Sixth Sense, he is absolutely adorable in this film. The rest of the cast, though, I am not so sure of. They deliver good performance but nothing that really stands out as near as good as the three leads, especially Jon Bon Jovi was terrible and unconvincing.The story on the other had trouble finding the right pace. I understand that it is difficult to edit two different timelines into one solid story, but Leder really missed the boat on this one. It was really to keep track of where the story wanted to go and the sheer amount of sidesteps in the story was very distracting from what the movie was really about, the relationship between the three leads.Honorable mention goes out to the make-up department for the wonderful accomplishment on the wounds on Spacey's face and body. This is Oscar-worthy material.I am aware that every visionary that ever lived was killed too early in their lives (King, Kennedy, Lennon, Biko etc etc) but why did Osment have to die in this flick. I think the movie would have benefited far better from an up-beat ending rather than Osment being the martyr for his ideas. The ending in itself was ludicrously American, I think if this ending was forced on Leder than it would have been better to stop the movie with Osment on the TV screen than having the whole world come to Las Vegas to pay tribute to Trevor in his front yard. Wrong choice, it left me unfulfilled, Leder slipped this one.When it comes to Leder, I have not seen Sentimental Journey yet, but I think she should practice more with not having all the grandeur in her films, I think she has potential to make a really moving film but her Americanistic big thinking always gets in the way (i.e. Deep Impact). She should take a good look at movies like Wonderland (Winterbottom, 1999) or Festen (Vinterberg, 1998).And than a little piece on the soundtrack, which was absolutely fabulous by Thomas Newman (American Beauty, Erin Brockovich). His work is becoming very recognizable in this business which is a good thing, because he has made some of the best and most moving soundtracks for movies in the past years.

Anybody who appreciates martial arts or stories of Eastern legend will love it!Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh have made an impact in the U.S. already with movies like Anna and the King and Tomorrow Never Dies.  In Dragon, they both demonstrate that they can perform ably as both martial arts phenom and dramatic actor of considerable depth.While at first blush this story seems to surround them and the chemistry between them, it becomes evident that this is really a story about the young princess they encounter in Peking.  While trying to recover a mystical sword, known in the subtitles as Green Destiny, and dealing with the intricacies of dynastic honor and family loyalty, each of them discovers severally that this young woman has an extraordinary amount of talent and grace.  More importantly, she is at a crossroads in her life, torn between family duty, true love, and her inward passion for a life free of responsibility, which is aggravated by the seldom-seen villain known as Jade Fox.  The coarse of events in the movie ultimately centers around her transition into adulthood and the gravest responsibility of all; deciding for oneself what path to take in life, and dealing with the consequences thereto.Enough about the characters for now.  The story is very well told, at some times severe, at others uproariously funny, at others heart-wrenching, at others introspective.  There is enough flashback and reference material that, even being thrown into the middle of the characters' lives, we can easily relate to the wide range of emotions and problems they face.  The ending wasn't what I expected, but is typical of Eastern legend and is in truth the best way to bring the story full circle.The cinematography is gorgeous, showing more than the standard wide-angle Forbidden City shots traditionally associated with China.  Instead we are treated to a vast country with an astounding variety of climates, from lush green mountains to dense forests to barren deserts rivaling the most arid parts of central Africa.But the true beauty of this film is in the action sequences.

The director clearly had no idea what he was trying to convey to the audience. It starts out as a somewhat serious and deep look at a depressed and confused young man, who begins forming a relationship with his English teacher.  But then after the first half hour or so, it's like the writers ran out of ideas.  The movie is suddenly transformed into a slapstick comedy, but the only thing is that the slapstick isn't that good, and the comedy isn't funny.  Then at the end the film suddenly becomes a feel good movie out of nowhere.  Just on a whim all the sadistic and depressed characters decide that everything's going to be all right.  I don't buy it. Must have been an early deadline for getting this script written.  The one thing I noticed about the movie though is that the more I got to know each character, the less I cared about them in any way.  I would see a character and think, well I like that character.  Then I'd remember, oh yeah, he's only been in one scene and had a two sentence speaking part.  This movie can be compared to The Big Lebowski in that it appears very confusing and to not fit together at all.  The difference is that the Big Lebowski DID actually fit together when all was said and done, and it was entertaining, and the comedy in it was actually funny.  I'm hoping the director's cut for this film will be about 10 minutes long.  That's about how much of the film had Katie Holmes wearing skimpy clothing.

It's manic pacing and overloaded visual style may annoy some viewers, but these techniques were quite intentional. The feeling of confrontation they create is completely appropriate to the subject matter and the story, set in the 80's Salt Lake City punk scene.Speaking of which, many of the comments on this site have harped on the fact that you have to be a punk to enjoy this film. This couldn't be further from the truth. Any fan of art, which by its nature tests the limits of society's rules, could enjoy this film. I would even hazard a guess that some true punks would enjoy it less than the average film buff, as turning a critical eye to the soundtrack or the exact depiction of affairs in the punk world could lessen the films overall effect, which is quite strong.This film deals in a meaningful way with the feeling of the Outsider. In that respect, it is perhaps a closer relative of On the Waterfront or Easy Rider than Pulp Fiction, the film to which it has most often been compared(largely because this is the inevitable comparison of 90's film.) What makes this film different from either Waterfront or Rider, as well as Sid and Nancy, is its often lighthearted tone. It is impressive that in this humor, we still can see most clearly the anger of the characters. It is a humor born of overwhelming tension and displacement rather than one of light-hearted frivolity and, as such, is completely believable.***Spoiler Alert***All this said, after viewing the movie, I was rather vexed by the ending. It was not so much the fact of the Lillard character's selling out that bothered me, but rather the ease with which he could accomplish the feat. To my mind, the film ignored its own wisdom, which lies in the fact that the true outsider feels too distanced from his society to be able to rejoin it, even as an establishment rebel, in one fell swoop. This movie is too good to end this quickly and wrap things up so tightly. A more realistic picture may have involved a somewhat tortured process for the Lillard character, which may have been difficult given the film's pace but which would have been much more believable.

Simply put, with Mel Gibson in the title role of a man fighting for his family and his country, I was expecting an historical epic that could somewhat reach the heights of Braveheart.  It didn't happen, but that's not to say The Patriot was a bad movie, which is not the case by a long shot.It's around the beginning of the Revolutionary War in America (specifically, South Carolina for this film), fighting for independence from England. Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson), a widower and father of 7, hopes to shelter his family from the horrors of war, but his attempts are rendered futile when his oldest son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger), disobeys him and enlists.After a few campaigns and battle defeats, Gabriel manages to return home, but insists he must go because he had been ordered to send dispatches. The British also arrive at the Martin residence, led by Colonel Tavington (Jason Isaacs), who takes Gabriel prisoner and has Martin's second child, Thomas, killed.Enraged, Martin ambushes the men escorting Gabriel, frees his son, and has them sheltered in the home of his sister-in-law, Charlotte (Joely Richardson).  But Gabriel refuses to stay, and returns to the army, with his father following aside.  Both eventually join and form a militia, which now has the assignment of trying to slow down General Cornwallis as long as possible and hold him in the south so the French can arrive in time.  At the same time they are taking down the British with ambushes, Colonel Tavington plans of a way to take down Martin and his colonial militia.The Patriot has so many things wrong with it that I'm surprised I didn't give it ** stars instead.  First off, the storyline is dull and cliched. Oscar-nominated screenwriter Robert Rodat's script is often unengaging and lacks the depth so vital to an historical drama.  He and director Roland Emmerich seem to be more concerned with inspiring subplots and cliches than real drama.  Consider the unnecessary side stories involving a slave who has to prove himself in battle, the daughter who won't speak to her father, etc., and you've got a movie that wastes too much time on material that really isn't all that important.Another flaw in the script is Rodat's obsession with injecting a lot of the humor into the film.  I have no problem with that, but only 1\/4 of the humor actually works, and it wears out fast after the first viewing, thus making the humor look out of place and even corny on a second viewing.But let me go into what is good in the movie.  The action scenes are impressively choreographed and the first ambush attack-with Gibson rescuing his son-is simply a magnificently done sequence, a white-knuckle set piece with true emotional power.  Had there been more scenes like this, The Patriot would have been a fantastic film.  The last battle itself is an exciting and long sequence, but features lttle compelling power or drama. Emmerich proves adept at handling action scenes, but does little to create true depth, instead often resorting to manipulation.The Patriot does have more action sequences than The last of the Mohicans and Glory, but you'd be surprised by the sometimes sluggish pace (as compared to the tight pacing of those aforementioned films).  When the movie's not on the battlefield, it can get quite slow moving (and even during the skirmishes, the annoying overuse of unstylish slow motion gets on your nerves after a while).  The fact is, the story is simply not executed well enough to maintain tight and undivided interest for 165 minutes.The performances are actually quite strong and help to lift the movie above its flawed script.  Mel Gibson is as great as ever, and his terrific portrayal of a man torn by family and country is one of his best performances yet.  Jason Isaacs is equally good as the villain.  His Colonel Tavington is convincingly cold and calculating.  Heath Ledger turns in a stellar performance, and his co-star\/love interest Lisa Brenner is decent (though her church speech is almost over-the-top).  The lovely and underrated Joely Richardson is good as Gibson's love interest but doesn't enough screen time to flesh out her character completely.  She also tends to speak rather slowly, as if though she's having a hard time trying to dispell her British accent.  The rest of the supporting cast is adequate, though some of the militia characters can get quite annoying.On the technical side, Caleb Deschanel's cinematography is at times gorgeous and the costumes and sets are convincing.  John Williams score is a mixed bag.  The haunting and foreboding elements of the score-particularly in the scene where Isaacs knocks the tomahawk out of Gibson's hand in their fight-work very well and is at times a terrible beauty to listen to.  The patriotic score, however, is too overly jingoistic and just too cheery.So, The Patriot didn't quite turn out to be that glorious epic I was hoping for, but it's by all means a watchable movie, one that I recommend with and\/or despite some reservations.  This year's true epics are really Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Gladiator, but The Patriot is a decent outing for those looking for some sweeping spectacle.

This is also one of my all time favourites.  I've finally been able to enjoy this movie in its original format after purchasing the DVD.  What can I say about this film?  The cinematography is just spectacular.  The other thing that just makes this movie stand out is the impressive film score by Basil Poledorious, the best film composer in the business today, better than John Williams IMHO.  The music is sweeping, exciting, and haunting, starting with the minimalist sounding The Wifeing to the loud, complete with full orchestra and choir, Battle of the Mounds.  My personal favourite is the Orgy, which is this incredible waltz.Conan is the last descendant from a race of Atlanteans, and witnesses the slaughter of his people and family by the ruthless Thulsa Doom.  He is enslaved and brought to a work camp for children.  It is through years of hard labour does he bulk up and become Conan.  After his master sees how large he is, he has him compete in some gladitorial combat, where he becomes victorious.  He is later released, and quests to destroy Doom, who is now the leader of a religious cult.  Conan meets the love of his life on his way, Valeris, and a friend, the thief\/archer Subotai.The acting is pretty standard for an Arnold movie, but not as cheesey. The scenes with James Earl Jones are really well acted, as well as the boisterous Max Von Sydow.  The thing that sets this movie apart from the other films in its genre is the heart in this movie, and the fact that it really doesn't focus as much on the sorcery as it does on the setting, and trying to ground this movie in history.  It has a historical feel to it, like it existed at some time, in some place.  There is a mystical aspect to it, like Thulsa Doom shooting snakes as arrows.Action wise, this is THE movie to own.  The sword play is very well done, and Arnold is quite believable as a barbarian warlord.  My personal favourite is the battle of the Mounds, just after Conan's prayer to Crom, where three men take out a chunk of Doom's army, especially the surprise that Conan delivers to Thorgrim.
