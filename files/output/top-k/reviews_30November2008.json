Where to start? first off, this movie is really boring. ignoring the fact that in space, shootings will make no sound, the spacecrafts are so cheesy and convoluted. cheesy moments between padme and Annie, Yoda saying wise crap, etc. half-hearted attempts made on the senator's life (if people like presidents and singers can get assassinated, much easier a senator can be), its just so clichéd! Then the acting abilities. Annie is just a pretty face. He screws up his face to act emo and evil. He has no emotions. He sounds fake when talking about how much he love Padme. Natalie Portman doesn't look like she can do yoga, much less fight, she's too skinny. Annie's mother's death scene is so fake! The evil cloner guy's son also can't act, he smiles evilly, but didn't pull it off. The plot is almost nonexistent. In fact, you could fast forward to the last hour and not miss anything. All the best ridiculous action are there. You see Yoda whizzing like a bullet, that's classic! Im not really a star wars fan, but i respect the intense amount of work put into the old movies. But this movie reeks of cheesiness, be warned! P.S. The music is too loud, and the talking are soft. Bad combination. The music also swells cheesily whenever Padme talk with Annie. Plot 1\/10 Acting 1\/10 Music 5\/10 Special effects 10\/10 Overall 4.25\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"30 November 2008","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Now i know why this movie got remade into an animated flick. it would be less irritating as a result.
