It is structured so that you know some of the basic tragic plot near the beginning.  This caused my eyes to water at some of the beautiful lyrical overhead tracking shots of the school bus winding through the snow covered roads of the Pacific northwest.The film switches between the time that the lawyer arrives in town to help the families receive compensation, and to days just prior to the accident. We witness a loving hippie couple who has adopted a beautiful Native American boy, a loving mother of a school phobic learning disabled boy, and a widower who loves his two children a great deal and sees them off to school by following them in his truck.  This same widower is having an affair with the mother of the school phobic--she is unhappily married to a pig of a husband.  Complicating matters is the father who obviously loves his teenage daughter in Lolita-like fashion.Part of the theme of The Sweet Hereafter is similar to Magnolia--accidents do happen--perhaps no one at fault... or perhaps all the adults had some part in it without anyone being at fault, as only the innocent children were killed.The town had changed... tragedy has taken away the town's joy and innocence. The parents are no longer open with each other, but guarded, suspicious... in deep grief.The lawyer is little more than an ambulance chaser, attempting to profit off their tragedy. Yet, he, too is a tragic figure who has already lost his daughter--He had saved her when she was a baby, yet she has now turned away from him... and his feelings are now ambivalent towards her--he is a grief-stricken, defeated father, who vascillates between wanting to talk with his daughter on his cell phone and deciding to cut her off.The story of the Pied Piper is interweaved between various events in the movie to give greater depth to the story.  There's also a great scene in the movie between the lawyer and the garage mechanic, who has lost his two children, that shows that the theme is much broader than the literal storyI'm telling you this because... we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel. They're dead to us. They kill each other in the streets. They wander comatose in shopping malls. They're paralyzed in front of televisions. Something terrible has happened that's taken our children away. It's too late. They're gone.This movie isn't for everyone. It's a serious, layered piece with a lot of melancholy.  The kind of fare that film critics can love, but Academy voters will avoid. But what it strives to accomplish is done very well.  And it will stay with you long after the final scenes have appeared.

Me, I haven't had as much fun since RUN LOLA RUN.  I think the disappointment stems from Soderbergh's disingenuous summary 'GET CARTER remade by Resnais', and the expectations this arouses. He is clearly talking nonsense, and having typical Soderbergh fun (which, as ever, is very difficult to catch) the film is much more about play, the failure of cinema and the 1960s.  What's most remarkable is the Proustian sense of history repeating itself Soderbergh, after a big success, Hollywood at this feet, squanders it all on an intellectual jeu d'esprit designed to alienate EVERYone.Soderbergh's tag is somewhat insulting - CARTER doesn't need Resnais, it is one of the last British masterpieces, as startling and dark an interrogation of the limitations of narrative as anything Soderbergh has offered.  The plot here is vaguely similar - a hardened ex-con goes to a strange milieu to investigate the death of a relative.  But the differences are crucial. Carter's relative was a brother, the abused teenager a niece.  Carter's revenge is therefore at a remove from him.  Wilson's quest is his daughter, a daughter disappointed by his persistant life of crime, who finally had enough and fled to the States.There is also a difference in the figures of the gangster and this feeds interestingly into the question of style.  CARTER is shot as straightforward narrative, with Carter dominating and forcing the plot.  And yet his power only leads to final emasculation and dissolution, his death is an end note for a genre.  Wilson, however, is repeatedly fragmented by style, by the strangeness of milieu, by the elliptical and elastic treatment of time, and yet he succeeds in both accomplishing his quest and achieving a sense of renewal.  Both are men from different times lost in a world that has utterly changed - Wilson learns to adapt.But even this is ultimately irrelevant because it presupposes a conventional treatment of character which THE LIMEY persistantly refuses to offer. Soderbergh has for a long time been subtly subverting the very representation we're supposed to be watching on screen.  The invocation of Resnais is worthless - true, Soderbergh uses overlapping image, montage, narrative and sound to crated an unstable drama that undermines character, plot, linear logic.  But it's never too unstable - once you get, quickly, used to the rhythm(s) of Soderbergh's editing, nothing is difficult to follow.He doesn't loop time back on itself as Resnais would to the extent where both time and place as coherent entities are destroyed, and the character\/pawns are lost in a vacuum sucked of all reliable signifiers. Say a narrative is a series of blocks going from 1-12.  Soderbergh might rearrange 2 and 3, say, now and again, but the plot follows a linear narrative that is easy to follow, everything follows as it should, with conventional enough flashbacks.  True, it is by breaking up the inevitablitiy of his plot, in a way Carter cannot, that Wilson becomes free. As a great man once said, 'A minute freed from the order of time has re-created in us... the man freed from the order of time'.What is important is not Resnais per se, but the whole range of 60s modes of culture - music, actors, directors, painters etc. - that Soderbergh brings into his stew.  It IS possible to watch THE LIMEY straight - there is an excellent car chase and some cracking violence - but the film feels improvisatory and amateurish, like Soderbergh took out the camcorder to muck about with his mates, using and discarding styles when it suits.  The presence of old icons like Peter Fonda force us out of the narrative - his stories and persona remind us of a different story, different people, different dreams.  It depends how alert you are - if you recognise Barry Newman as Fonda's minder, the car chase is less a plot component than an ironic inverse of VANISHING POINT, an awesome chase movie, in which Newman was chased over America by the police for two hours.This iconography has its locus in Terence Stamp (still astoundingly beautiful and graceful after all these years).  His performance has been largely ignored over here in favour of the ineptness of his accent, but this latter is something he tries on, like his clothes, his gun, his persona, his cockney rhyming slang.  These are of course patently false - like him, they are definitively outmoded.  But so is the film.  It's astonishing, as with RUSHMORE, that a film harking back over 30 years should seem fresher and more challenging than what's concerned 'modern' today.Check the remarkable scene in the narc's office where Stamp gives a monologue that amounts to nothing more than a stand-up routine of tired cliches of how an American director thinks hard Brits speak.  It is obviously ludicrous, but Wilson isn't a character.  He is the ghost of the promise of the 60s note the haunting, dreamlike strides he takes early on, a somnambulent walking through the empty wasteland of modern LA.  The constant flashbacks refer not to his character, but a character Stamp played in the 60s, a time when he, Fonda, Joe Dallesandro starred in daring, new films that promised to destroy the mainstream, but never did.Soderbergh manages to make the individual plights here very moving - Wilson's oneiric flashbacks; the sexual undercurrent of his quest which ends in his daughter bleeding, as if he has just violated her, not Fonda (the film is very much about how cinema is masculine, and the absences and suppressions this allows); the depressing, inevitable circularity of the plot; the extraordinary use of space, landscape, sunlight, and shadow to open out and refigure character (especially Fonda's house, hanging on the precipice of a canyon); the unsettling, shifting power of the gaze; the hilarious black comedy (see Wilson's wonderful dispatching of a bodyguard) - but ultimately this is a film about disappointment, age and the failure to deliver.

Conventionally, the rites-of-passage concerns the traumas and awakenings of a seemingly isolated young individual as he or she takes his or her place in ordered society.  KING OF THE HILL follows the opposite movement, the existential journey of a family son to an awareness of his own solitude.Like most rites-of-passages, this movie offers an episodic narrative over a single plot.  1933 Aaron Kurlander is a bright and imaginative pupil at a public school for rich kids.  His once wealthy parents suffered during the Depression, and now live in a dismal hotel where bellboys in the banks' pocket skulk in corridors waiting to throw out those who can't afford to pay their rent.  Aaron lies about his social position to save face, but his father is a failed candle salesman, and his mother is a consumptive, and they must send Aaron's little brother to stay with a remote uncle.Increasingly deserted by his family - his mother goes to a sanitarium, his father gets a job as a travelling watch salesman in distant States - and neighbours - who are being thrown out of their rooms - Aaron is forced to live by his wits, helped only by an older friend, Lester, a petty criminal.  He goes through the usual adolescent adventures - taunting policemen, driving an out-of-control car, conducting a tentative relationship with a strange, epileptic girl - and tests of masculine courage (in rites such as marbles), but these only serve to alienate him further from his peers.  His only remaining neighbour is a formerly wealthy businessman turned pimp, trying to keep an air of resigned gentility.  One day Aaron gets a note saying that his father has three days to pay their rent or they must leave.The evocation of the period certainly seems painstakingly accurate - the houses, avenues, alleys, hotels, schools, clothes, cars, street stalls; the air of despondancy and lack of hope; the marbles and crackling radios; the kind of poverty that forced some people to dress in their underwear; the remnants of gangster\/bootlegger culture; the American need for mythology.  This is compounded by the gorgeous sepia-tinged cinematography, evoking many of the familiar ways the America of this period is constructed in the collective memory.  The year 1933 is also the year Hitler became Chancellor in Germany, and although the fact isn't explicitely mentioned, there is a tacit critique of an American society of ominous paralells anti-Semitism; racist, fascist policemen; repellent WASPs, whose snobbery goes into collective, nightmarish action against the upstart outsider.  There are two very powerful images that evoke the camps that will feature in Germany over the next decade - the gaunt artist, Mr. Sandoz, forced out of his apartment into a makeshift settlement, dressed like an emaciated prisoner; the Jewish Lester being carted off by the police for bootlegging, saying goodbye to Aaron as if he'll never see him again.All of these elements seem to fix KING firmly in time, except for one thing - the style.  If you weren't told you were watching a film from early 1930s America, you wouldn't know it.  Whatever the horrors displayed on screen, the camera retains a dignified distance, with slowly elegant movements, opening and recording space like it's an Antonioni film.  The beauty of the photography, the perpetual sunlight, the charming music, the set design that makes a shabby armchair and a suburban mansion equally attractive are completely at odds with the story that is being told. Although the story is about a boy who is cut off from his family, partakes in risky adventures, undergoes demeaning social experiences and eventually begins to starve, the film doesn't vary its point of view or style to accomodate his mindset, always keeping the same steady distance.This might sound simply like bad filmmaking, but it's not.  Soderbergh's main interest is in how we represent history, how we construct our images of it.  This disparity between form and content forces us to question our responses to the latter.  How is it possible to make a pretty picture about the Depression?  Throughout the film signs are foregrounded and interrogated (eg billboards, the chessboard floor of the hotel, the discussion in the lift about different types of letters); the difference between how we experience reality and how society chooses to depict it.  This is brought most terrifyingly home when Aaron can't afford any food, has no-one to turn to, and is forced to cut out pictures from a magazine and arrange them on a plate.  This is also probably why the ending feels so ridiculous and forced - an impossible deus ex machina which weaves together a number of disparate crises into an ideal whole.  Only moments earlier, the film had finally begun to break its distance and show Aaron's mind in all its nightmarish terror.  How reliable is this ending?  Isn't it another example of the American inability to face genuine misery head-on without some kind of preposterous redemption?  Isn't American history simply a narrative of evasion?

It only confirmed what I thought about it all along It's one of the all-time great screen musicals, as well as one of the most innovative. Shot partly on location in New York City, you get that gritty where-it-happened feel from those opening tracking shots over the city, through that chilling close-up of Russ Tamblyn, successfully breaking away from nice boy roles as Riff, and on till that heartbreaking end when the gangs find understanding only in tragedy.Co-director Robert Wise, who up to then had been associated with good small-scale films, such as Curse of the Cat People, Odds Against Tomorrow, and I Want to Live, proved his worth as a director of big pictures with this film. He would go on to do The Sound of Music and Star! later in the decade, but this is where he established himself as a director of musicals. Co-director Jerome Robbins, while he'd done some brilliant work on Broadway and staged the musical sequences for the film of The King and I, had never handled an entire film before, and his too-painstaking-for-the-studio's-liking approach caused him to be fired fairly early on. His presence and influence, however, are felt throughout the film. Rarely had screen audiences seen dance sequences so energetic as in the Dance at the Gym and America. However, it was all a bittersweet experience for Robbins, who returned to Broadway and, apart from staging the dances for the film of Fiddler on the Roof in 1971, essentially washed his hands of Hollywood.That the music is some of Leonard Bernstein's best goes without saying. A true genius, this distinguished composer\/conductor\/educator never composed better music than he did for West Side Story. In truth, he spent the rest of his life trying to outdo his greatest achievement as a composer, and the results were mediocre at best, disasterous at worst. His young lyricist, Stephen Sondheim, proved to be more than up to the task, as well. One can already see those qualities which would make him one of Broadway's most illustrious names in the years ahead.Finally, we have the performances. I tend to agree with those people who feel that Richard Beymer's Tony comes off as being a little too whitebread for the part, but the other performances make up for it. Natalie Wood, even with Marni Nixon's singing voice coming out of her mouth, makes a convincing Maria, the childlike innocent becoming a woman steeled in grief in the space of twenty-four hours. The two Oscar-winners in the cast, George Chakiris and Rita Moreno, bring an intensity and strength to Bernardo and Anita. Simon Oakland's Lieutenant Schrank solidified his tough guy image. And, among the gang members, Elliot Feld, later a celebrated director-choreographer himself, and the late Jose de Vega, turn in especially good work as Baby John and Chino, respectively.In short, this is a film which just gets better over the years.

Whether you're seeing it for the first of hundredth time, it's still terrific.

If you think that one romantic song playing while the word us goes up and down, from one side to the other in the screen is annoying and that the first scene, when Katie (Michelle Pfeiffer) looks direct to the camera, alone, sitting in a sofa, and starts to talk about her wedding as in one documentary, is boring, you possible won't like it. But if you like one or both, as I did, you will for sure love The Story Of Us. The film is about one couple, Ben and Katie. They're married for about 15 or 17 years and they can't stand 15 minutes without one fight. As their children are in a Summer Camp, they're going to use that time alone to see if must stay married or divorce. Their situation is so serious that Ben will stay in a hotel while Katie will stay at their house. Most of the movie are past situations remembered by the couple. And that's the best thing about The Story Of Us. They're always reminding funny and happy situations but at the present time they just fight and fight. So, you have 10 minutes of romantic-comedy then 10 minutes of drama. And you don't even know what to fell. Should you laugh at the funny things or remember that these funny things are being shown because they're missing them, because nowadays they're just the opposite? Michelle Pfeiffer and Bruce Willis were great. I still think that watching Bruce in dramatic movies is a bit strange but as I had already seen his good performance in The Sixth Sense, I'm losing my preconception. And Michelle is perfect (as always) and just like the movie her face is so delicate, she looks sooooo fragile and nice but in fact her character, Katie, is very nervous and incomprehensible. So, that's how The Story Of Us is very realist. Don't expect a super-romantic story but a dense and real relationship with fights, screams, shouts and sometimes, kisses. In fact, that's the kind of relationship that we all have! And, to conclude, is The Story Of Us a highly recommendable film? Well, it's not a everybody-love-movie as The Sixth Sense but I think so.

With an equally ragtag band of idealists as his crew, this quixotic visionary hits upon an absurd scheme to bring his godawful action film script to fruition;  after it is handily rejected by Kit Ramsey, one of the hottest action stars in the business, Bowfinger concocts a scheme to film his screenplay AROUND the actor, plotting the man's every move, following him around town, and instructing his own amateur actors (who are oblivious to Ramsey's obliviousness) to jump out and act out their parts for the hidden cameras before an increasingly startled and distraught Ramsey.  This clever setup generates a considerable wave of comic energy that propels the story forward even though, like most films that rely heavily on a one-joke premise, the film does suffer a bit from the diminishing returns of repetition.  However, Martin's creative skills as both a writer and director keep the idea fresh for most of the film's running time.The film is blessed with an absolutely smashing comic performance by Eddie Murphy, who brings just the right note of both arrogance and anxiety to his portrait of a superstar whose internal insecurities and paranoia are hidden beneath a veneer of arrant egotism and aggressive despotism.  Murphy is less successful with his other role, that of a shy nerdish Ramsey look alike (he actually turns out to be Ramsey's brother) whom the crew is compelled to use as a stand in for the real star when the latter is driven to seek a rest cure to soothe his frazzled nerves, caused, ironically, by Bowfinger's own antics.  In all fairness to Murphy, however, in the character of Jiff, the actor has been given no solid center from which to build an effective comic performance.  As a writer,Martin has failed to really develop Jiff's purpose in the proceedings and the character seems tacked on mostly to give Murphy a chance to indulge in some weak displays of slack jawed buffoonery.Where the film does triumph is in the constant inventivenss of the situations, particularly the clever way in which Ramsey's paranoia dovetails so nicely with the absurdity swirling around him.

Nevertheless, Martin creates a tone of utter devil-may-care silliness that sparkles throughout the often quasi-slapstick proceedings.

The filmmakers obviously imagined that viewers of this movie have already seen the original. For I Still Know What You Did Last Summer has no character development. Nor does it bother to inhabit introduction to the motives of the characters. It concludes with so much stupidity in its script, it is amazing this film ever got the green light in the first place. \t I Know What You Did Last Summer detailed the misadventures of four young adults who accidentally ran over a fisherman named Ben Willis while drunk partying on the fourth of July weekend. They presumed he was dead, so made the conclusion that they should dump his body in a nearby lake instead of explaining their situation to the police. Ben Willis actually did not die, however, and he mysteriously came back to haunt the teens.  He ended up killing two of the four individuals, and mentally imprinting his horror in the minds of the survivors, especially Julie James. He is presumably killed at the end of the film.In I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, the film opens with Julie having nightmeres at school about her incident with Willis two summers ago. We then see that She has a few new friends, Karla Wilson, who has a boyfriend, Tyrell, and a new interest named Will Benson. The second remaining survivor, Ray, is still in the picture. The story has four teens, Julie, Will, Tyrell, and Karl, winning a trip to some tropical island on a radio station contest. The question asked  what is the capital of Brazil? They say Rio and jump up and down in joy of victory.Wait! Isn't the capital of Brazil Brasilia? Yes, as we learn later, it is indeed. So, why did the characters, who are so inane they don't know a simple geography question, win a trip to an exotic island in the middle of nowhere? Because the entire preparation is a setup brilliantly prepared by Ben Willis. He plans to lure the teens to a place where they will be unable to escape his clutches. The vacation spot is also a place where few people will stand in his way. But if the contest was rigged, why are there so many individuals, seemingly unconnected to any events proceeding, involved with the teens stay at their vacation? And just why would Ben Willis want to kill so many people that just happen to appear in the selected scenes? He kills because of passion, not craziness or relentless torment. This is obviously because the movie only features two surviving individuals from the last film. Thus is forced into providing audience pleasers for the lacking viewers craving such gory sequences.  I Still Know What You Did Last Summer has no common sense or intelligence. It continuously feeds us insipid sequences. For instance, there is a scene in the beginning where Julie hears someone in her house while she is alone. She tries to turn on her lamp, but it  burns out immediately. She grasps a large kitchen knife to defend herself assuming a murderer is in her presence. Then, after the movie builds up enough scary momentum, someone jumps out at her. It turns out to be Karla. But why would Julie's best friend sneak into her house late at night and not turn the lights on? And why would she jump out and scare Julie when she knows that she has been having some scary times in her life? We get this kind of material continuously.

For instance, there is a scene in the beginning where Julie hears someone in her house while she is alone. She tries to turn on her lamp, but it  burns out immediately. She grasps a large kitchen knife to defend herself assuming a murderer is in her presence. Then, after the movie builds up enough scary momentum, someone jumps out at her. It turns out to be Karla. But why would Julie's best friend sneak into her house late at night and not turn the lights on? And why would she jump out and scare Julie when she knows that she has been having some scary times in her life? We get this kind of material continuously. Then, finally, after several false shock moments, we actually begin to witness slasher scenes. But by whom? An old man with a hook for a hand who could easily be overtaken by several of his much strong and younger victims? Where can this horror flick go right?The movie offers a potentially scary atmosphere a deserted island with a hurricane on the rise. But doesn't that sound a bit like Jurassic Park? And I had another question dealing with the insanity of this production. If Ben Willis is so determined to seek revenge towards his victims, why does he always walk calmly towards his prey when if he picked up his pace a little, he could have easily prevent the person from escaping his claws. I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is one of the stupidest movies to come down the pike in some time.  Brought to you by Columbia Pictures.

Kit soon experienced characters (actors in Chubby Rain) walking up to him in public and doing acts, calling him Kieth, saying they love him, he soon is freaked and goes to a psychiatrist-like person at Mindhead (Terence Stamp). We discover that Kit used to see aliens and such and he thinks that the people coming up to him are aliens. And the movie Chubby Rain is about aliens coming down in rain drops. Soon he is running away from steve martin, heather graham (in her first well-acted role) and... Baranski (can't remember her first name). He is freaked and then theres the writer of the script who starts oozing brown goo, jamie kennedy (my fave actor from Scream, Scream 2, Three Kings), and then the cops find out about the making of chubby rain without bobby's permission we're talking about jail time. But soon the mexican immigrants they hired to be producers get footage of Kit doing something which persuade his psychiatrist to film the final scene. Also thrown in is (spoiler - - - -)Kit's brother (also Eddie Murphy) who they hire to do scenes when they can't find places to get the real Kit (when he doesn't know it's happening)Of coarse they don't know he's kit's brother. There are a few hilarious scene in this movie like when kit's brother must run across the freeway where stunt drivers are driving in his way, the fact that Heather Graham sleeps with anyone and everyone to get what she wants, the brown goo scene and whenever the actors come up to kit and do their scenes without him knowing and the fact that in the final scene they show the final product and it looks so amatuer and perthetic it is too funny! Then there is the scene with... Baranski with the knife when she is possessed by the aliens and she's screaming it is pure comedy. Steve Martin script is hilarious when it wants to be and as always my fave actor Jamie Kennedy gives a good performance but honours must go to Heather Graham who's acting skills are really put to the test (unlike in Scream2 where she played an actress in a movie within a movie that was meant to be cheesy, or Austin Powers 2 where i thought she didn't act well!

Running Time 104 minutes. Rated PG (for action violence and some gore, mild language, and brief sex-related material) By Blake French As I walked out of the theater in which I screened Galaxy Quest, I thought how surprised I was to have enjoyed what seemed as a cheesy family spoof. But the film turned to be an action adventure with some really hilarious moments. I loved the film. It has qualities of a successful science fiction drama, but also contains a variety of comical characters that had the whole audience overwhelmed in laughter. Galaxy Quest is right up there with Toy Story in merit, it entertains adults and children alike, standing out as one of the year's best family films. The story details the adventures of a canceled television science fiction fantasy cast, similar in content to Star Trek. Galaxy Quest is the name of the program. In their years, the stars, including Jason Nesmith, Gwen DeMarco, Fred Kwan, Alexander Dane, and Tommy Webber, were some of the biggest, most popular names in TV. Now, their means of making a living is signing fans' autographs for a price and being cast in amateur presentations. There is very detailed character development here. The characters are wonderfully cast and brilliantly portrayed. Unfortunately, most family films don't contain the patience for such necessary material. We bond with these characters; they are likable, funny, energetic and independent.  These individuals are the key of success to this kind of movie.The real plot begins when strange people come to Jason beging for him to save their existence from a powerful evil force who wishes to wipe them out of the universe forever. Naturally, at first our television star is skeptical, but when the strange people turn out to be humble aliens and transport Jason to their spaceship, he realizes this is something serious. The aliens begin to explain that they think he and his Galaxy Quest team are the only people in the universe who can save their race. He rushes to the members of his old cast and tries to justify his experience. He says that there are extraterrestrial creatures who require the help of their Galaxy Quest characters. None of his friends believe him, but once again give in when they find themselves transported off earth, onto the creature's spaceship.  Of course, the aliens don't realize that their hopeful heroes are simply out of work actors, but who needs to tell them? So it is up to Commander Peter Quincy Taggart, Lt. Tawny Madison, Tech Sergeant Chen, Dr. Lazarus of Tev'Meck, and Lt. Laredo to save the day for our innocent and haunted alien life forms. Galaxy Quest is a slapstick comedy that is smart, and does not go over the edge with its humorous material. It leaves room for several other essential elements such as happiness, romance, honesty, excitement, and contains a dramatic purpose. The story is very original, and contains a firm theme of action in its premise. It also has lots of outstanding visual effects and sight gags that are effective and interesting to watch. Although the film gets a little off-track near the end, Galaxy Quest is still  high energy laughs audiences will come to the theater expecting. This is one of the most victorious movies of this year in its execution of the script because we anticipate what we are going to view is a silly comic spoof. Even though parts of the film fit that definition, in the end we end up with a lot more than that.Brought to you by DreamWorks Pictures.

He plays Lloyd Dobler, an average(ish) high school student who is about to graduate.  He lives with his single mother sister Constance and her young son, while his parents are with the American army in Germany.He is besotted with Diane Court, an apparently beautiful brainbox whose astonishing academic success has been achieved at the cost of peer contact. She lives with her father, James, who runs a lucrative old folks home, and who comes under investigation from the IRS for mismanaging and defrauding his clients' money.  Diane is awarded a prestigious scholarship in England, but becomes derailed by her relationship with LLoyd, who, for all his aimlessness, offers her an emotional security she never had with her acrimoniously divorced parents.  She is seemingly obliged to decide between Lloyd and a glittering career, until shock revelations about her father force things to a head.There is nothing offensively wrong with SAY ANYTHING.  There is vague pleasure to be had in spotting future minor celebrities (Eric Stoltz, Jeremy Piven, Lili Taylor).  Writer\/director Crowe tries to incorporate a few formal devices into a generally naturalistic framework, such as the pseudo-Greek chorus of Lloyd's three girlfriends counterpointed with his late-night advice session from his male friends.The film is also mildly subversive.  The scene seems set for a reactionary tract about broken homes - Lloyd's parents are absent, Diane's are divorced. It might be suggested that the fears and aimlessness felt by the young in the movie arise from a lack of direction offered by the parents.  The parents are the culpable ones here, in Diane's case horrifically, unexpectedly so.  Lloyd is a thoroughly decent and dependable, as a surrogate father, as a kick-boxing coach.  Diane is finally able to make a decision after the burden of parental pressure is lifted.  It is seen as right to abandon the tainted tradition of the past.This is figured in the wonderful role-reversal ending.  All the way, as Hollywood convention decrees, it seems as if Lloyd, as male hero, is going to be Diane's teacher, despite her brains - he shows her how to fit in with her peers, how to achieve independence from her father, how to drive etc. But at the end, he goes to England with her; she is allowed fulfil her career; he is the, usually female-coded, hanger-on.  An 80s film about leaving America for Europe suggests an anti-Jamesian quest for freedom from corruption, uncertainty etc.  Happily, the film ends on unbalance and doubt.ANYTHING's problems are two-fold contrivance and lack of humour.  There is an air of phoniness about the whole thing, from the tried and tired 80s high school movie rituals, to the gropings for emotion (using sub-Phil Collins music as signifiers for emotion is really tacky and distancing).  The whole film, as my wife pointed out, is shot in a flat, TV-movie style, which focuses the now embarrassing 80s detritus.The lack of humour is the fatal flaw for a supposed comedy - anything that could be satirised is turned into melodrama; the fratboy slapstick has been done better elsewhere, the determination to take these characters oh-so-seriously lessens any attempt to see their angst as faintly ridiculous.  Which leaves verbal comedy.  As the title suggest, there is a running thematic motif concerning communication, truth, concealment, the ability to formulate emotion in words.  You can't say anything, it must be the right thing.  But too much talk and too little visual distance results in a very dull film.

There is an air of phoniness about the whole thing, from the tried and tired 80s high school movie rituals, to the gropings for emotion (using sub-Phil Collins music as signifiers for emotion is really tacky and distancing).  The whole film, as my wife pointed out, is shot in a flat, TV-movie style, which focuses the now embarrassing 80s detritus.The lack of humour is the fatal flaw for a supposed comedy - anything that could be satirised is turned into melodrama; the fratboy slapstick has been done better elsewhere, the determination to take these characters oh-so-seriously lessens any attempt to see their angst as faintly ridiculous.  Which leaves verbal comedy.  As the title suggest, there is a running thematic motif concerning communication, truth, concealment, the ability to formulate emotion in words.  You can't say anything, it must be the right thing.  But too much talk and too little visual distance results in a very dull film.  It IS interesting that middle-class white boys wanted to be black so early as 1989.  Of course, there isn't a single black character in the film.

She can play anything.  She can switch moods in the blink of an eye and make it look believable.  As for James Caan, well I already knew he was a great actor even before I saw Misery and I was very surprised to see he didn't get a nomination for his role in Misery.  The Stephen King   adaptation is excellent as well.  I think it's the best I've seen after The Shawshank redemption.  However, Rob Reiner has done some much greater jobs as a director than for Misery.  A few good men, for example, shows how much directing talent he has.  But he didn't use it all that much in Misery.  Paul Sheldon (James Caan) is a novelist who has invented a character named Misery Chastain and uses her name in each title of the Misery books.  Each time he finishes a novel, he goes up to a little lodge far from the city and once the novel is completed, he has one glass of champaign and one cigarette.  After having finished his latest novel, he starts to head back to the city.  However, a big snow storm starts and Paul has a terrible accident.  He wakes up in a house and the first thing he hears is I am your #1 fan.  He comes to realize he is in the house of a woman named Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) and who is a nurse.  It seems Annie has taken great care of him and has put bandages all over his body so that he can heal properly.  She tells him that as soon as the roads are clear, she will take to a hospital.  A few days go by and Annie and Paul have become friends.  One day, Annie asks Paul if she might be allowed to read the last Misery novel Paul has written before he sends it to his editor.  Paul lets her and she is very happy.  The next day, as she is giving Paul his soup, she tells him she has read forty pages of the story.  Paul asks her what she thinks of it.  She tells him she is no person to give him a critic but insists on the fact that she gives him the critic.  She tells him there is way too much cursing.  Paul tries to tell her that the cursing comes from slump kids and that he was a slump kid and that is the way they talk.  Suddenly, she starts yelling at him telling him that they do not talk like that.  After a few seconds, she apologizes and leaves the room.  But the same night, Paul gets a rather nasty surprise.  Kathy Bates deserved the Oscar she won and James Caan deserved at least a nomination.  As for Rob Reiner's directing, well it is very disappointing considering the great movies he had done.  His directing truly gives the viewer the impression that this is not a theatre movie but a TV movie.  But the movie is worth seeing simply for the performances.  Richard Farnsworth does a great job as the local town sheriff in a supporting role and Lauren Bacall has a cameo role as Caan's editor and she is very good also.  It's worth watching.

It is certainly thought-provoking, and Cherry Jones is infinitely watchable, as is Vanessa Redgrave; in fact, there isn't a Bad Performance in the film. However, I have to take issue with a handful of smallish issues that I couldn't avoid noticing.First of all, I think it helps to know a bit about the art and politics of the 1930s before anyone even thinks of seeing this film, if only because of the little textures thrown in which Tim Robbins and his production crew so obviously labored over -- the relationship between Diego Rivera and Freida Kahlo, Nelson Rockefeller discussing the future of art with William Randolph Hearst while Orson Welles is throwing a play downtown -- and it is these details which help the film rise above itself. I have never seen Robbins' other directorial efforts (Bob Roberts and Dead Man Walking), but I will say that he has a bit of an obviousness to his style. Subtlety is forsaken in honor of Symbolism and Irony that are planted so as to be immutable to the audience -- possibly to balance the great historical detail that may be lost on the underinformed.My greatest beef with the film comes from the fact that Angus McFadyen plays Orson Welles. Not that I have anything against McFadyen, who is normally a fine actor, but apparently someone thought it wise to play a good majority of the historical figures in this movie, Welles included, as cartoons of themselves, quite one-dimensional. Welles comes off as A Character, not a genius, which he is alleged to be in most accounts, and McFadyen seems to let a hint of an accent slip into some of his lines, which is probably unavoidable. What was avoidable is the fact that in 1936 Welles was 21, and McFadyen certainly doesn't pass for his 20s, period. It seems odd to me that Robbins would choose to overlook a large detail like that in favor of aestheticism.Still, beyond all of its minor successes and flaws, Cradle Will Rock is an ultimately satisfying film if only because of its final twenty minutes. After all of the hardships fought to be able to put on the title play, the actors involved do a spectacular job of pulling it together, even if they will only ever get to do it once. Hank Azaria is wonderful as Marc Blitzstein, the playwright in question, and the scene as a whole is inspiring even to those who don't create art for a living.

Both Gere and Roberts have improved as actors since PW in 1990, but the story here didn't give them much help.Ike Graham (Gere) loses his job as a columnist over an unsubstantiated story he writes about Maggie Carpenter's (Roberts) habit of leaving her prospective husbands at the alter in full flight.  He then takes a trip to her small town to see if he can get the real story and vindicate himself.  The story is ok to here, but thereafter it is contrived and implausible. The minute he arrives, everyone is just delighted to tell him Maggie's most intimate secrets.  That's just not the way small town folks act with complete strangers, especially big city reporters who just made a mockery of one of their own.  Since this universal acceptance and intimating is the key to everything that comes afterward, it makes the whole story a little far fetched.Despite this defect, the characters are well developed, and flawed though they are, they are lovable.  The age old romantic comedy angle of antagonists falling in love gets a good treatment here.  The plot really produces no major surprises after about midway through the film, but as this is a romantic comedy, everyone is rooting for it to end the way they expect anyway.As before, Gere and Roberts have great screen chemistry.  Richard Gere plays a little different character here than he is used to, less macho; more vulnerable and sensitive.  This was a much more mature performance than the cocky arrogant roles he usually takes on and I think it marks an expansion of his talent.  Julia Roberts is...well...Julia Roberts.

Mary Reilly, Conspiracy Theory), she will always do well.Marshall did the best that could be done with the script he had and kept the story moving along well.
