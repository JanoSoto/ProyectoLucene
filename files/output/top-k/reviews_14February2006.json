His life was absolutely amazing and i'm sad he couldn't go on living forever. His beliefs, in that period of time, were looked down upon. He surprised the British Empire so many times and deserves every credit he was ever given. This is a great story of an amazing man. I believe that it was help you more fully understand his life, accomplishments, and beliefs. It has some graphic features, so if you choose to show it to children, use caution.

When art is routine and banal, you feel on second viewing that you've seen the scenery before and might as well not bother. Some popular art is so banal you feel you've seen it before even if you haven't - like one more mile of prairie on a long train trip or a one note actor in an action flick. (no names mentioned). I've seen On the Town somewhere between 10 and 20 times, but I'm always discovering something new and pleasurable . This latest time around for instance - the continual ribbing and double-entendre aimed at Sinatra. and the brilliant transitions between segments of music. Leonard Bernstein was probably the most successful composer at bridging the gap between serious and pop music. Like a great athlete, he made the difficult seem graceful and easy. But, as you listen closely you realize that the effortless sounding pop music isn't even pop music at all. The rhythms and harmonies are on the cutting edge. They just don't have that painful angst that the cutting edge too often seems to carry like an albatross around its neck. Looking at all the musical credits it's hard to say just how large his contribution was, but the flavor of his work is heard throughout. As, I imagine, his collaborators left their pop music mark on his serious music. Is On the Town the father to West Side Story? I wouldn't be surprised. Gene Kelly's first job was as a dance teacher and it really shows here. Look closely and you can see him taking his co-stars by the hand and leading them to heights they could not reach without him. And, as the other great dancer of Hollywood's golden age, he shows himself to be incredibly generous with the spotlight. In fact, the flashy moves belong to the gorgeous and sexy Ann Miller who dominates the museum scene. In contrast to the earlier work of Busby Berkley and Hermes Pan, this choreography flows naturally out of the action and looks like spontaneous fun - no geometric floral arrangements - no canes imitating machine guns. Instead we see an ensemble looking like they're having a great time and getting laughs while they're at it. Sinatra is at the pinnacle of his early singing period, though he has little in the way of romantic material to work with. (he's stuck with the cabby after all). What stands out in this movie is his ensemble singing, reminding us that he started out singing with Tommy Dorsey's Pied Pipers. Whenever he joins the ensemble, the harmonies just seem so much richer. This really shows when they group the boys together and the girls together. The boys win cause they have Sinatra on their team. I could go on and on about the details and the depth in this movie, but that would detract from its most salient characteristic. On the Town is FUN FUN FUN from start to finish.

Ultimately it always comes down to The Godfather and Goodfellas. It's like debating over who is better, The Beatles or The Stones? Both are fantastic movies, but offer two different view points on the same subject. I do believe that The Godfather offers a more romantic point of view of the mafia. Perhaps that is because it focuses more on the early years of the mafia. The good years. Goodfellas covers a longer period of time.Including the early 80's when the mafia began to fall apart due to its involvement in drugs.Regardless of whether you prefer The Godfather to Goodfellas there is no denying that Goodfellas is an amazing film. Total perfection. From the directing to the acting to the soundtrack. This movie is flawless.As much as I think The Godfather romanticizes the mafia, when you watch Goodfellas you'll find yourself drawn to the characters and lifestyle depicted in the movie. Goodfellas is THAT powerful. Are these good people? Hell no. But it's all relative. Yes, they are all scumbags, but some are worse than others. When you finish watching Goodfellas, ask yourself this Are you ticked that it's over? Are you angry that Henry got busted? Do you want to punch the cop in the face when he licks the cocaine off of his fingers smiling at Henry as if to say, Busted!Stellar performances throughout make this a must see for anyone who considers themselves a fan of film. How powerful are these performances? I happen to think De Niro deserved an Oscar simply for the way he smoked a cigarette. The scene where Henry confesses that he knew Jimmy was going to whack Morrie. Sunshine Of Your Love by Cream begins to play as the camera zooms in on Jimmy (De Niro) standing at the end of a bar, smoking a cigarette, pretending to pay attention to someone who is talking to him as he stares off into the distance in anger. THIS is my favorite scene ever captured on film and it lasted less than 30 seconds. This scene is why De Niro is the best living actor. Without saying a word his facial expressions are Oscar worthy.De Niro aside, the movie is loaded with talent. Hell, even Martin Scorsese's mom, Catherine, steals a scene.The plot follows a crew in New York. In the beginning they ruled the neighborhood and ran all the schemes. When it all fell apart one of their own sold them out in court to save his own ass. It's not a movie for the squeamish. The f bomb is dropped constantly and the violence is real and raw.It's been said that when watching The Godfather you almost feel as if you are watching a family's home movies. If that is true, then Goodfellas is like watching the home movies the family didn't want you to see. These are not admirable people.

Most people over the age of 25 will deem it 'self loving' and 'ostentatious' but unfortunately few people under the age of 18 will actually understand what this film is all about.Donnie is troubled and meant to relate to us as an audience, and Gyllenhaal as always does that superbly, perhaps his talent was over-shadowed by the films overly pretentious ending.Donnie Darko's blink and you miss 'em jokes and dark humour might be wasted on some people who are wanting laugh out loud gags, which they aren't going to find in this film.If you're thinking of slitting your wrists Donnie Darko will only remind you of how awful the world is and how little you actually mean to anyone - so give it a miss.If you're looking for a light little piece of cinema to entertain you one evening, you might be shocked to find that Donnie Darko requires some thinking and might just root up some unanswered questions about your life - so give it a miss.If you're immune to psychological hallucinations and become freaked out easily then Donnie Darko might just terrify you - so give it a miss.If on the other hand, you're in for a little 'deep thinking' and want to be moved, then Donnie Darko is the perfect film for you, and will give you some wonderful topics of conversation over the coming months.If you like your 'indie-cool' flicks with clever plot-twists and meaningful scenes of silence then this film will open your eyes to how a slight pause here and a little look there can create a whole lot more than reels and reels of drivelling script.If you have a slightly odd sense of humour and are fed up of the 'Frat Pack' comedies like Anchor Man and Wedding Crashers then this little gem will take you away from the gags and offer you a darkly humorous, intelligently funny film.If you're a fan of any of the (surprisingly) star-studded cast including a fantastic Patrick Swayze and a slightly weird Drew Barrymore then that won't fail to delight.Or if, as most self-acclaimed fans of this movie will be, you just want to join the ranks of pro-mainstream teens who think they're making a bold statement of their intelligence and individuality by listing Donnie Darko as one of their favourite films, then watch it.

Its 1980's feel and look, De Palma's directing and of course Pacino's wonderfully diverse accent twinned with his ruthless efficiency as both an actor and a character make it something special. The glossy Miami setting proves a wonderful backdrop for the protagonist's quest to achieve in life, and achieve he does. Although spoofed on a number of different occasions, nothing really gets taken away from this film as it, in a way, 'got there first'. It contains all the original, necessary atmosphere and 'mise-en-scene' required to really grab the viewer and suck them in with its slick and often loud character attire, exotic setting and eerie lighting in some scenes, announcing the violence to come before we even suspect anything.Apart from the rather erratic captions early on in the film, there is little you can find fault-wise in this film. If you like the genre and the sense of the narrative i.e.; it is rather lending itself towards dialogue more than action in a 60-40 balance and will have all the necessary scenes to draw out the 'climbing the ladder' scenario, then this film is definitely for you. The interesting accents and one-on-one conversations the central character has during the film with numerous friends and foe's alike adds to the sense of time being passed and rungs being climbed - it works very well.The mind spinning soundtrack full of 80's music is something you can't really decide whether to love or loath but thanks to a certain computer game from a few years ago, they seem to have regained a bit of respect amongst fans and it is certainly a breath of fresh air in the sense it's different when comparing it to standard music as a convention found in other mobster movies such as classical Italian themes in 'The Godfather Trilogy' and 1950's tracks being pumped out to mobsters in black suits when thinking of 'Goodfellas'.What also sells this film is the element of narrative once the character feels he's reached a certain stage in his goal. When he feels he's hit the top, the journey through Pacino's characters mind is equally as fascinating as the one we had when seeing him attempt to get there in the first place. The paranoia and obsession with security early on in his 'reign' is a hint of things to come and the bloody climax builds up through Pacino's good acting and a turn of events which helps us really begin to recognise with what a danger he has become through corruption of power.Despite its basic 'American Dream' plot, Scarface deals with it in some style and punch which is perhaps lacking in other films in the genre. Its nice iconography, mise-en-scene and decent acting from the cast puts it in a healthy position near the top of all time greats of the genre and possibly of all time.

Richard Matheson turning his own novel into a perfect scenario ending up in a real quality celluloid adventure.It's a 1954 classic that belongs in the must see list of every movie-buff. Not is it only an iron-strong story filled with extreme powerful acting it's also amazingly in it's special effects for that time, remember we're in the 50ties. FX that are hardly spot-able and figuring out in exact which way they did it is one of the pleasures. The FX are really outstanding, everything you see is and feels real. Keep an eye on the suspense created by director Jack Arnold in the attack of the spider scene. No use of dummies or other fake material. Realism here is to key towards success in many of such scenes.The story handles the narrative of a guy, Scott Carey who starts to shrink little by little throughout a nature phenomenon that affected him while he was on a boat trip. Once down to a couple of inches he has to fight his way thru the vicious incredible gigantic world. His surroundings becoming a fierce jungle and the only thing he can rely on are his primordial survival skills. Even the most ferocious little things and creatures turning into rancorous phenomenon's of another world.The plot is simple though pretty strong and worked out in a superior way. There are little till none faults, open plot lines or story mistakes to be found. Actually more the opposite. By watching the movie you will discover they have covered each and every little detail.

Nowadays Misty might be considered a rehashed old concept but in 1971 the stalker film was a new concept. Made on an extremely modest budget (in fact Eastwood directed the film for FREE!), filmed entirely on location in Eastwood's town (which he later became mayor of.) Play Misty For Me rivals any Hitchcockian thriller I have ever seen. In fact I think Hitchcock was likely a major influence on Eastwood's style and direction for this film.Clint Eastwood not only directs for the first time but also stars in the film. He plays small town radio disk jockey Dave Garver. This is one of Eastwood's most unique roles. His gritty, rough image is truly put aside to portray a womanizing normal guy who gets caught up in the wrong situation. It's without a doubt one of Eastwood's best portrayals. After a supposed no strings attached evening with a fan of the radio show played brilliantly by Jessica Walter (Golden Globe nominated performance) Dave discovers he can't get rid of his one night stand quite that easily. Walter portrays Evelyn, a seemingly normal nice girl who gradually begins to take her obsession with Dave way too far especially when Dave finally wins back his former girlfriend. Jessica Walter in this role is quite simply insane. She rivals the great Kathy Bates in Misery for the most screwed up obsessed fan ever. She goes from nice to insane in split seconds and looks great doing both. You become almost annoyed with her but not because her performance is bad...the exact opposite, you feel Eastwood's annoyance with this clingy girl who eventually loses her mind completely. Donna Mills plays Eastwood's true love interest Tobie. She's the real nice girl and her and Eastwood have some great chemistry and you want them together. The rest of the supporting cast all do a great job along with the three main stars of the film. The banter and interaction between Eastwood and Walter is just captivating and her gradual loss of sanity is scary. It's the most suspenseful, and riveting film for it's time. Now it does have it's down sides. There are two rather tacked on, overly blatant love scenes and another annoyingly LONNNNG scene at a music festival. So long I fast forwarded it and missed nothing. But everything else is done brilliantly and this is a must see classic. You haven't seen suspense until you've seen Misty. Misty is what everyone says Psycho was for the sixties (although I was never a fan.) This film turned Eastwood into the Hollywood multi-talented star that he remains to this very day. You have to watch every shot to truly appreciate what he does and consider nothing in this film was done on a set or sound stage but rather in real homes, building, radio stations, on the cliffs...everything. It's brilliant and just feels so real and the character progression is equally as impressive.

The story is great (although nowadays not new territory by any means) but watch the film remembering that nothing like this existed at the time and you'll see it's true brilliance. 9\/10 ","genre":"Thriller"},{"date":"14 February 2006","score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" In light of the disturbing number of invective-laced replies, over on the discussion boards, to any post that DARES to criticize any aspect of this film, this seems to me the preferable forum in which to offer a handful of personal observations based on my somewhat less than positive response to Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange, a film I believe enjoys a gratuitously inflated reputation; a film of some value, but not the masterpiece so many have hailed it as.Kubrick sticks to the source novel rather closely here.

Here is the longest movie he did (three hours), and the theatrical version is only half of the original which was twice as long. But length should not stop you from watching this jewel of a film, which is both complex and accessible. After all, Gone with the Wind is just as long.Fanny and Alexander isn't exactly a family movie, but it is a movie about family. Family seen in all its different facets through the eyes of two children. The film is divided into three very different parts, each of them showing a different aspect of family life. It is set in Uppsala, Sweden (Bergman's native city), at the turn of the twentieth century. The story begins on Christmas Eve, and we are plunged right away into a fairytale atmosphere.Fanny and Alexanders family seems a happy one, actually a family of theatre actors. During the Christmas Eve party held at the grandmother's heavily-furnished house, the atmosphere is joyful at first glance, especially for the children who obviously feel very much at home. But reality is not just what it seems. The children's father is seriously ill. One of the uncles is manic-depressive, and the other is a skirt-chaser who has an affair with the young maid while his wife shows a lot of comprehension. Even the grandmother keeps a secret affair with a Jewish banker (played by Erland Josephson, a Bergman regular) that has lasted for many years.The children's world collapse as their father dies. Soon after, their still young and beautiful mother marries the bishop, whose name is Vergerus (that's the name of the villain in all Bergman's movies, don't ask me why). The atmosphere in the bishop's house could not be more different from the children's first home. It is bare, silent, freezing. Alexander and the bishop hate each other from the start. This hate culminates when the bishop flogs Alexander to punish him, during a suffocating scene. War is declared from then on. Although the children's mother is pregnant, she already regrets her second marriage and seeks help from her former family.The grandma's Jewish friend, who is also sort of a magician, manages to kidnap the children by a clever stratagem. They are sheltered in his house, which is full of puppets and mysterious objects. There, a strange nephew of his lives in seclusion (the role is played by a woman). From then on, reality and fantasy get blurred, but what is certain is that the evil bishop meets a cruel fate, and the children's mother finally makes it back to her former home. The film ends as it began, with a party. Two new babies are just born  the mother's baby she had from the wicked bishop, and the maid's baby with the luscious uncle. The two of them are accepted immediately as part of the family, which is a rather precocious sign of Scandinavian open-mindedness (in 1900, illegitimate children were generally rejected as bastards).Despite the title, attention is focused much more on Alexander than on Fanny. She is there all the time but speaks little, while showing unconditional solidarity with her brother. A possible reason is that the movie seems to have strong autobiographical elements, more than any other Bergman, and if so, Alexander seems to incarnate Bergman himself as a child. Bergman's father happened to be a minister, and the director confessed that he was raised in a very oppressive manner. Thus, it is quite possible that Alexander's step family is a representation of Bergman's real family, while Alexander's real family is the family Bergman had dreamed of, unsurprisingly a family of actors.This film also displays the most accomplished use that Bergman's renowned photographer Sven Nykvist ever made of color. He was a long time reluctant to color and kept shooting in black and white well into the sixties. Bergman's first color movies had nothing special, until Cries and whispers where an obsessive use of red started to appear. The color contrasts are very strong in Fanny and Alexander, and are especially used to underline the difference between the grandmother's colorful home and the bishop's house which is mostly all black and white. There are many characters in this story, and all the major adult roles are played by actors who are all very famous in Sweden. There is a special appearance by Harriet Andersson, who played the female lead in many Bergmans of the fifties, especially well remembered as the whimsical Monika. Here, she is ungratefully cast as the bishop's elderly tormented servant who likes scaring the children with horror stories. As for the young maid, she is played Pernilla Wallgren, who married Danish director Bille August and became later famous as Pernilla August. She played the lead in The best intentions directed by Bille August but based on a script by Bergman, and also taking place in Uppsala at the turn of the twentieth century...

I can't believe this is in the top 50...100...Hell! It shouldn't even be on the top 250! It belongs more in the bottom 100! How the hell can anybody think this movie is Good? It contains pretty well every action-movie cliché EVER! And when the hell did Jean Reno become Superman? He seems to be SO aware of his surroundings that he can kill dozen upon dozens of people, and then disappear like a fart-in-the-wind while the bad-guys run about like a bunch a chickens with there heads cut-off; but yet, when exiting a building, he NEVER seems to notice Gary Oldman walk up behind him and shoot him in the back. GIVE ME A FREAKING BREAK!! And if that wasn't lame enough for you, the filmmakers decided to through in a 12 year-old Wanna-be Hit-man (girl?) Natalie Portman who likes to play dress-up for the middle-ages Jean Reno, in what is sure to be the most Horrific musical montages ever put to film!Oh yeah, did I mention that this movie is Completely ridiculous and impossible!! And I'm sure it's much safer for a 12 year old girl to live with a certified and hunted hit-man, than it is to go to the police, FBI, CIA? Oh wait! Those are the bad-guys. Then couldn't she go stay with family? Oh wait! She has no family. This movie is SO F *cking Contrived it isn't even funny...No wait, it is funny! I was actually laughing...physically laughing when this movie started to unfold and every utterly ridiculous plot-device started to stack itself together. And really? Jean Reno wouldn't want ANYTHING to do with this girl EVER!!!I used to think that The Matrix was the biggest joke in the top 50...but this takes the cake by a mile! (and is it me?

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"14 February 2006","score":"","review":" I think that this movie was one of best zombie films. I say because it takes a different view on the zombies films. It has humor, which is good, and has the classics, gore and horror. If you like zombie films, you'd like this one. The cast is good, and proof that the government is up to something. This film shows what would happen if something like that did happen. I think I would act like cast in the movie. I mean, he dead just don't come to life very often. Since there are remake of the other zombie films, there should be a remake of this movie. I have the DVD and it's nice to get the commentary and making of. It also has sketches what the zombies would look like. Plus, a storyboard for the film. I wish there would be more stuff on the DVD like deleted scenes and things like that. But, in general I still think it's a ten on the scale. I really recommend you see this movie because it explains a lot. Well, that's all I have to say about this movie. Well one more thing, I guess. I love this movie!!

Many of us are like Judah, in that we are so burned up with hate because of the injustice of the world. We feel lost and cry out to God during personal unfortunate events, and feel Him with us. The best scene in the film is when marched to the galleys, Judah cries out, God, help me!, and our Lord gives him water. That does it for me! I have this movie on DVD, along with King Of Kings, The Robe and Jesus Christ Superstar, all of which I consider among the best Biblical movies ever made! The movie itself is basically historically and Biblically correct (even though it is a piece of fiction). However, there are a few inaccuracies here and there, which by no means take away from the grandeur of the film. First of all, the Romans had no concept of emperor as the word is understood today. The Roman emperors were imperial dictators with a variety of powers (based upon Latin words), which were bestowed upon them by the Senate. They have been labeled emperors because one of the titles the Senate gave was imperator, which in Latin means, commander-in-chief. The other inaccuracy is the very nature of Tiberius. He was far from the benevolent figure portrayed in this movie, or in The Robe. Tiberius was a paranoid tyrant, who had members of his family murdered on suspicion of treason. As this film wrongly portrays, he was also never in Rome, but had a private villa on the island of Capri, and left most of the affairs of state to his Praetorian Prefect, Sejanus. Always suspicious, Tiberius opened what he called treason trials where rumored enemies of the state were tried, convicted and murdered in cruel and unusual manners.That aside, this film deserves 4 out of 5 stars in my book!
