Maybe, it's just because I've not seen a lot of teen comedies.It was year 1996 in Russia, when I bought this movie on VHS in little shop near my house. At this time I was a little stupid kid. I think, I was 10 or 11 years old. This movie made a big impression on me. You know, it's kinda hard to explain my feelings in English, cause it's not my native language, but I'll try.Since I was a kid, I wanted to become a cool, mature guy. I thought that being mature is like having parties all the time, drinking alcohol and so on. Senior trip had it all in it. It was really funny, it had all this cool music, that I tried to like. At this time I got my first Nirvana CD. I liked to be the one I was. I liked being bad, talking in bad language, joking about sex. Yes, I was a bad kid. A really bad one. After years of life such as this I get to hospital, I was really depressed, but it has nothing to do with the movie.It was very cool to listen to grunge music in 1996, though it was not so popular in the US. And the movie felt like a grunge movie for me. Yeah, I know it's a very stupid movie, it has a lot of crap in it, but I still like it, cause it was like a Bible at my teenage. It showed me another, alternative life, not the stupid life I was living. My best friend liked this movie, too. He is the only one whom I showed it to this day. For me it's very personal movie, though it's neither about my life nor about my country. I think, it's very hard to understand, why I think it's great. Cause it's just my feeling, which I can't explain in Russian, too.After this movie I saw some teen comedies like American pie, Road trip, Not another teen movie, Scary movie, but all of them are a much more badder than Senior trip. Yes, I laughed when I watched first parts of American pie and Scary movie, but I've never wanted to re-watch them again.I don't think that this movie will be a hit, if it gets re-published today. The world has changed, the teenagers have changed. This movie is a history now. Nothing else. But in my heart it is a classic.

How could they possibly have made a movie this bad? Two actual good actors, Gary Oldman and William Hurt, are trapped in this atrociously written, badly directed waste of $80 million. Whether or not you liked the cheesy 60s TV series, you're going to hate this.Alright, this is how it goes it's the future and there's pollution, world peace (ugh!), and terrorists. The Robinson family is going to fly through a hyper-space-portal (or whatever the hell they call it) to a planet on the other side of the galaxy to colonize it and save humanity. Hurt, playing a respected scientist with no time for his kids, says at a press conference there's a lot of space out there to get lost in (ugh!). Matt LeBanc from Friends is horribly miscast as the flying ace who will pilot the Robinson's earth-saving space ship. Then we come to the children... but we wish we hadn't. The little boy is a science-fair genius who wishes his dad had more time for him and the girl is a teenage stereotype who argues with her mother and keeps a video diary. They both have very high, annoying voices, and the lines they deliver are terrible on top of that. Then comes the mother. I don't know who played her, and I don't want to know. They all live in a futuristic house in a futuristic CGI geodesic dome (ugh!). Except for family tensions I don't want to give up the next ten years of my life, the mission appears to be a shoe-in.Then we meet Gary Oldman, the 1998 version of Dr. Smith. He would have been a terrific character if his lines weren't so terrible (I think Akiva Goldsman was trying for Shakespearian). Anyway, he's evil and loves it, and works for the terrorists. He sabotages to mission, getting himself trapped on the ship in the process, and getting the Robinsons lost you know where.Along the way we see thoroughly unconvincing CGI used for just about everything, including an annoying monkey-creature that's supposed to be cute. The costumes (which director Hopkins had a hand in designing) are really terrible glossy-body-mold stuff (think BATMAN AND ROBIN for comparison) which basically gives everybody (even the kids) well defined ahem!- features. Even the music is bad, and horribly arranged. And the end titles go above and beyond tacky, being half music-video, including a rapped-over version of the original theme and sound-bites from the film. And then there's the robot, which the son makes friends with and teaches that it has a heart (ugh!).The script and direction are still probably the worst atrocities in LOSTIN SPACE. One of the more embarrassing bits has LeBlanc explaining to Heather Graham (to whom he is pathetically attracted) the concept of constellations and draws Porky Pig on a window. Even during intimate dialogue scenes, none of our actors seem sincere, or even to be speaking to one another. These characters don't even talk like human beings.It's hard to believe the studio didn't just put this one on the shelf and leave it there. In the end LOST IN SPACE didn't even make enough money to justify its release. The world really would be a better place without this movie.

Again, I am shocked and appalled at how brutal the other so called expert critics are towards this very funny movie.  Some critics bashed it because of the gullable way in which the college staff and students fell for Krippendorf's ridiculous plot.  Basically, Dreyfuss plays James Krippendorf, a college professor raising his 3 kids due to the untimely death of his wife and professional colleague.  They both studied native tribes in Africa, but the wife dies leaving Krippendorf very depressed and unable to continue with these tribal studies.  The college is unaware that he hasn't continued his research in spite of the generous grant which was spent on everything except the research for which it was intended.  He devises a scheme involving himself and his kids playing native Africans from a lost tribe being filmed on location to have something to show for the misappropriated grant funding.  His film is a big hit and he is forced to continue to make up additional stories and film on this lost tribe.  Jenna Elfman plays Veronica Micelli, a fellow teacher and admirer to his work who unknowingly gets duped into becoming a part of this scheme (by getting drunk and having sex with Krippendorf while both are made up to look like African natives in a hut!)  Lili Tomlin plays a jealous professor who doesn't like all the attention that Krippendorf is getting from this lost tribe and decides to investigate whether this tribe exists (by flying off to Africa to see this tribe herself).  Although this movie has a ridiculous premise (who would really believe that the lost tribe films were authentic in real life), it is still very funny and deserves a better rating than the 4.9 that was given.  I would give it a 7.5 as a comedy because it has many funny moments.  Krippendorf standing in front of a large classroom and nervously weaving his tall tale of the Mike-a-moo tribe with a blank sheet of paper as his research notes and the way which this story escalates makes for a very entertaining comedy.  Some critics should learn to develop a sense of humor and not bash films such as this for not being realistic in content.

It's also an excellent character study, about real people with real emotional conflicts. The two principal players, Jodie Foster and Richard Gere, are excellent in their roles, providing nuanced and subtle performances, and generating some intense chemistry between them.What sets this film apart though is the directing. If I were teaching a film class in direction, I would use this film as a highly-skilled example of the craft. Jon Amiel was able to draw excellent performances, not just from his two leads, but from the supporting cast as well. The film moves from one scene to the next with a seamless ease that helps draw you in to its complex story. Unease and menace are skillfully used in counterpoint to the burgeoning relationship of the two leads. And the story is resolved well, providing a path to redemption for a fallen man, and creating a mythic hero in the process.Without revealing any more I will just say that for me, this movie is a treasure. I hope I've piqued your curiosity enough to induce you to discover its hidden assets.

If I were teaching a film class in direction, I would use this film as a highly-skilled example of the craft. Jon Amiel was able to draw excellent performances, not just from his two leads, but from the supporting cast as well. The film moves from one scene to the next with a seamless ease that helps draw you in to its complex story. Unease and menace are skillfully used in counterpoint to the burgeoning relationship of the two leads. And the story is resolved well, providing a path to redemption for a fallen man, and creating a mythic hero in the process.Without revealing any more I will just say that for me, this movie is a treasure. I hope I've piqued your curiosity enough to induce you to discover its hidden assets.

I was amazed with the beginning of the story, one of the most scary I have ever seen. Yesterday I decided to see 'When a Stranger Calls' and it is indeed a tense and suspenseful thriller. The situation through which Jill passes is amazingly real and scary. When the police officer tells Jill that the phone call is from inside the house, he heart of the viewer 'jumps'. This part is too frightening. The greatest problem in both movies is the continuation of the story seven years later (five in the sequel). It breaks the tension and the viewer gets completely lost about what happened to the characters. With a better sequence, this film certainly would be considered a classic. The story is excellent, and the performances are very realistic. In my opinion, the famous 'Scream' copied the introduction of this film.

However, as one reviewer pointed out, it was difficult to tell whether some actors were playing themselves or not.

I live in a divided household (I love Evil Betty & my brother is a staunch supporter of the Chosen One) which makes for some hilarious episodes in our life, usually right when we're in the middle of an argument. ^_^Well, anyway, Kung Pow is a movie that I recommend that everyone see, simply because you have to watch it to formulate your own opinion on it.

No action, no intergalactic menace for Kirk and company to thwart, no ENTERPRISE, for crying out loud...nothing...just a moronic space probe providing what may well be the most contrived excuse for a voyage in sci-fi history! Even if a Star Wars fan intent on sabotage had slipped into the scriptwriting conference, I can't imagine how he could have done a better (by which I mean worse) job. For the blissfully uninitiated, a space probe appears over 23rd-century earth and starts causing storms. Why is the probe causing this havoc? Is it a plot for revenge by the not-quite-dead-after-all Khan? Have the Klingons declared war? No! The probe is destroying the earth because...wait for it!...it wants to 'talk' to a couple of humpback whales! This is utterly beyond belief. It reminded me of the South Park episode where the campers summon the spirit of Moses, and ask him what he wants, and he answers that he wants popcorn necklaces, macaroni drawings, and bean\/paper plate tambourines with glitter on the sides. And South Park wasn't being serious! Why didn't the writers resurrect some space villain from the original series, and have him hold the planet hostage until they produced two humpback whales? They could posit that this villain intended to don a pair of water skis and do jumps over the whales, once the earthlings had handed them over. I can honestly tell you that such a change could not possibly have made the movie any more ridiculous than it already is.Now, I probably wouldn't last a week at Starfleet Academy, but I just don't buy the story (which is wisely left unelaborated) that it's impossible to blow this space probe up. Of course, the real reason they can't blow it up is that this would end the movie, before Kirk and the gang got a chance to swim with the whales. So, they go back in time to pick up these whales, and oh brother, it's about the most heavy-handed thing ever to disgrace the screen. Not only do we get a love interest for Kirk who REALLY has whales on the brain, we are treated to a TOUR of the whale's aquarium (lovingly laid out in real time!), replete with films of poachers carving the whales up (!), long-winded speeches about whales (mostly from the aforementioned Whale Woman), and a final confrontation between the Klingon ship the crew is using (no Enterprise, remember?) and a whaling ship. I must admit that I was very surprised that Kirk didn't dispatch the poachers with photon torpedoes. I have a hard time imagining that this idea never occurred to the writers, but I have an even HARDER time imagining the people who wrote this dreck thinking of this idea and then dismissing it as hitting the audience over the head too hard. At least it would have provided a single explosion for the producers to put in the trailer. In fact, I don't remember one fight or confrontation in the entire movie. It's as if the people who wrote the film (one of whom was Leonard Nimoy himself) were venting some kind of hidden hostility or frustration with the series. It's as if they set out to destroy everything that made the original show so enjoyable. Shoot, they even have Spock sporting a big toothy grin as he and the others take a dip with the whales! The only thing worse about the movie than the fact that it was ever made is that it has become regarded as one of the best of the Star Trek movies (!!!). Let's just say that this opinion tells us a lot more about the quality of the Star Trek movies as a whole than it does about this one in particular. Okay, there was one good part in Star Trek IV.
