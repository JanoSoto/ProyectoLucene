However, I enjoyed Yentl immensely, despite its flaws.First of all, the music is magnificent.  Michel Legrand wrote songs that are both perfect for the movie and can be taken out of context as concert material (some of them, anyway--Papa, Can You Hear Me? is somewhat of a stretch).  However, I was supremely disappointed that Mandy Patinkin doesn't sing a note in this movie.  Obviously, the movie was meant for Barbra--it was HER baby--but still.  Why cast Mandy as your leading man (and he was very appealing, I must say) in a movie-musical and not write a single song for him?  Gah.And to everyone who says that the movie is not credible because Barbra could never pass as a man, I say listen to the soundtrack.  There's a lyric in Tomorrow Night (the one about her wedding to Hadass) that says They may have eyes but they don't see,\/They never really look at me.\/People are blind!\/How else would everyone believe me?  Yentl didn't think that her plan would ever work, but people are easily deceived by her man's clothing.Anyway.  I liked this movie very much, and I certainly recommend it, but I can see how, if one can't stomach Barbra Streisand, it might be a bit jarring and obnoxious.

The results of that chance meeting leads to a sizzling and torrid affair and ends in murder and deception and finally the loss of Ned's freedom in what has to be one of the most erotic and well thought out Film Noir movies ever made. Unlike the great Film Noir movies of the 1940's like Double Indemnity and Out Of The Past to name a few Body Heat is not hampered by the restrictions and limitations of the Hayes Commission back then. That's the reason it's much more interesting and less predictable then movies at that time were. Matty who's husband Edmund Walker, Richard Crenna, had her sign a prenuptial agreement before they were married wants him dead so that she can legally inherit all of his wealth. Matty talks a love stung and unsuspecting Ned into killing Edmund not knowing that she's only using him and will drop him as soon as her husband is dead. Ned goes along with the plan even though it seems to be against his better judgment. Even later when Ned starts to realizes that he's some how being set-up to take the fall he's still so infatuated and in love with Matty that he can't seem to help himself from going along with her scheme to kill Edmund. Edmund, the unfortunate husband of the scheming and deadly Matty, in spite of being an astute businessman and good judge of human nature as well as tough as nails doesn't see what's coming in what Matty has in store for him until it's too late. Good early career performances by Ted Danson, Peter Lowenstein, as Ned's friend and fellow lawyer and Mickey Rourke, Teddy Lewis, as an accused arsonist who Ned got off and who later reluctantly gets involved in the murder plot on Matty's husband Edmund. Teddy at first tries to have Ned change his mind about murdering Edmund but without any success. Also very effective in the film is Oscar Grace as J.A Preston a detective and friend of Ned who despite being on to Matty from the start is blind-sided by what Matty's ultimate plans really were, like everyone else in the movie. Superior story and acting with a really unsuspecting ending makes Body Heat not just one of the best Film Noir movies of all time but the one that all movies of that genre are to be compared too in the future.
