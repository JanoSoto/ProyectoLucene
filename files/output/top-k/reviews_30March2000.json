Rob has recently had a breakup with his girlfriend of several years, and this opens up a period of time in his life where he begins asking whether he is incompetent in relationships or merely if relationships are inherently faulty.  This dialogue with the audience is punctuated with hilarious instances of conflict with the two music nerds that work at Gordon's music store.  The choices of music in this movie are fantastic because most of them are quite obscure yet very good--perfect for a movie about music gurus.  Most of the acting is performed nearly flawlessly.  High Fidelity reminds me a lot of Annie Hall both in quality and content (although this one is more post-modern).  In fact, you could almost call this a Woody Allen movie without that annoying, neurotic Jewish guy.  The plot has numerous twists and turns without seeming busy, and the narrative format is perfect for conveying the personal tribulations that Gordon experiences.  I've given High Fidelity a tentative 10. . .almost a nine but the music is so good.  This one will surely be a classic sometime.

However, it does stay with you long after its closing. What I found most interesting is the pace of the film- we are talking about a well-constructed plot with momentum and suspense, and PLENTY of visceral violence.  However, the pace of the movie is nearly lethargic, with the fade-outs after every scene (Sixth Sense also used this well.) Jarmusch does an incredible job of putting us in the soul of his protagonist without ever knowing (sabiendo) his personal history or motivations (we know him about as well as the other characters can.)Whitaker is a wonder to behold here- he is casually lethal, lighting-quick instincts within a hulking, slow form, in no way seemingly heroic yet all honor.  I hate most hip-hop, but the music of the RZA (pigeons and sword-fighting tunes the best) was perfect for his character. I happened to like Louie's character and the Haitian ice-cream man they respect Ghost Dog for his devotion though their ways differ.It's hard to say I loved this film, because its pace is so slow. Ghost Dog is not a roller-coaster it is a succession of well-crafted moments such as the Latino, the Haitian, and the hitman marveling at the boat on the roof, wonder and admiration filling in for language.  Its ending is very satisfying in bringing the girl into Ghost Dog's ways, while Louie is finally the only one left standing, with nowhere to go but into his hitman's favorite story.I mention the Professional for the parallel of the young girl learning the ways of the reticent hitman, who learns to open himself to her.  I thought about the differences in Jarmusch's and Besson's visions of the city (supposedly NY?) where Besson sees seething corruption, Jarmusch sees random, pathetic violence.  Both see a certain self-destructiveness in the city, but Besson was far too modernist, simplistic, and tragic about it (solution get out to Roosevelt Island and save yourself!).  Jarmusch also sees death in the city, the death of beauty, codes, and honor, as lamented by the RZA in the opening song.  However, he complements this, as only HE does, with a real postmodern joy in the lack of universal\/hegemonic truths, codes, and language.  The mishmash of the American city holds as much potential as it does disillusionment.  It is after all the only place where a story of an African-American samurai of the Italian Mafia can find a home.

The bizarre, the romantic, the sad, and the funny all hold a place in the travels of Michael, Dempsey's character.  Writer, Rupert Walters, takes Dempsey's character, a college student in love with being in love, to Quebec where the object of his affection remains for Christmas. Jennifer Connelly plays Michael's girlfriend Gabriella, Gaby for short. Gaby drops out of school and returns home to Canada when her grandmother, played by Lila Kedrova, becomes ill.  This vacation to bring Michael and Gaby back together turns out to be an exploration in to love and sex starting when Gaby tells Michael that she is no longer in love with him. Michael's confusion about his situation begins to worsen when Gaby's odd sisters begin to interact with the sexually tense Michael.  The grandmother, or Granny, is afflicted with some sort of Alzheimer's disease.  Granny, at times, mistakes Michael for her late husband also named Michael, which fuels a relationship that requires and teaches love.The spitfire Gaby and her two sisters confuse and toy with both Michael and the audience.  The seemingly promiscuous sisters taunt Michael by jumping in and out of his bed and even kissing him.   Michael's loyalty to Gaby is almost non-existent as evident in his deeds and dialogue with her sisters. These three temptresses remain static throughout the movie while Michael develops his knowledge of adaptability and reason.  Granny eases Michael in to the thought of love and not just sex, however, I found the scenes between the two characters abrupt and not as significant or impacting to the movie as they should have been, as they came and passed quickly.As the movie progresses Michael learns from and interacts with the family and he seems to grow more distant from the emotional aspects of his relationship with Gaby while being pulled in different directions.  While Gaby and her sisters, on the other hand, are doing the pulling they do not show any signs of logic or reasoning in their actions, which Michael caters to.  By the end of the film we see the three sisters acting as if they had learned something from Michael when it was really the other way around. This development seemed more like a transparent farce than an answer to a complicated question.  Gaby's father is another question mark to this movie. He remains nude through the most of the film, yet he seems very stern about any physical contact between Michael and his daughters.  The idea behind the nude conversations, containing reference to Mr. D'Arc's work, is lost in the tension between the two.  Without this theme the audience is left simply gawking at the naked father and seeing Michael as a typical appeasing suitor for Gaby.  However, the theme of nudity for this film can not be suppressed. Nudity causes and alleviates Michael's problem.  Drawn to sex by the injection of nudity in to the already tense plot his chase is only overruled by love that he sees with more nudity, strangely involving the grandmother.The family's dog, Beowulf, plays only a minor role in the story.  However, his name and an alarm clock smack of symbolism.  The alarm clock shared in bed between Michael and one of Gaby's sisters embodies the pursuit of sex that is ripped away when Beowulf clutches it in his mouth when it goes off the next morning to wake Michael.  Michael ends up throwing the alarm clock out the window and Beowulf jumps out after it.  In the story of Beowulf our hero jumps in to waters of great depths chasing after Grendel, a man-eating monster.  However, the display of our hero, Beowulf, chasing the all consuming monster of sex and the comparison to the original monster is an intricate theme and difficult to recognize.  Although if Michael rids himself of the alarm clock by throwing it out the window and the clock is really a symbol of sexuality this could foreshadow a moral behind the story.This film is a combination of comedy and tragedy like no other film I have seen before.  The bizarre sexual comedy can actually be likened to that of another film starring Patrick Dempsey, Loverboy.  In this film Dempsey plays a pizza delivery boy who makes extra money by serving as a gigolo for female customers ordering pizza with extra anchovies.  The element of tragedy for this film is very short and supposed to tie the movie together, however, I feel it is drowned out by the comedy and nudity relating to the sex.  For instance, the inevitable death of the grandmother is bypassed for a sexual encounter and then later revisited for questions and impact to the plot.This film is suitable for really any audience with the possible exception of young children due to nudity and sex.  The concepts and themes are universal to all and can be understood or at least listened to by any class, race, or group of people.  However, those offended by nudity or displays of sexuality should refrain from viewing, but the screenplay is tastefully written. For those viewers willing to ponder the themes, characters, and other elements a good deal the movie is worth while.  Although, the fast-paced plot really suggests a second viewing for those interested in a more educational experience.  Dempsey plays young, confused, and in love Michael very well. The father, Mr. D'Arc, was very convincing even if he was a minor character. The rest of the cast seemed a little amateur, but overall the thought process revealed in this film makes it worth seeing even if it does lack in other areas.

MGM's Return to Me stars David Duchovny and Minnie Driver in a light-hearted comedy that is tender and romantic. The center of the plot to this film is a heart. Sure we have the blooming hearts of our main leads but we also have the magic of a real beating heart. You see these star-crossed lovers have a connection to this heart. Driver needs the beating heart to heal her from a heart defect and Duchovny's wife is the donor after she is tragically killed in an auto accident.Return to Me is one of those romantic comedies that suffer a lot from the cliché of the formula but as we watch we really just don't care. What makes this film a notch or two higher than the average comedy is its beautiful honesty and tender characters. Minnie Driver has a lot to do with why this film is so successful in this aspiration. Like her film credits behind her, Minnie has nailed the insecure girl next door image down to a science.

Building off that strong of a center you have a beautiful set of characters around her that accent her inner magic.As the film opened, I was worried about the stiff acting of David Duchovny and wondered if he had what it takes to be a romantic lead. In some ways I found myself surprised by his talent. One scene that really grabbed me was when he fell down in front of the front door. Overwhelmed with tears, he stretches out for his dog which loved his wife as much as he. These scenes with the dog brought out a side of Duchovny which was wonderful, passionate and honest. They brought out a depth Duchovny really has never touched on. There were a lot of stiff scenes Duchovny seemed to be lost in but from just seeing those dog scenes I think in time Duchovny may open up. Some of my favorites moments in the film are in the brilliant chemistry of the four patriarchs who look out for Minnie. Carroll O'Connor and Robert Loggia are two of Minnie's guardians. Its great to see these veteran actors doing something so light hearted. This is a group we won't soon forget because they were hiliarious.

For those who complain of the lack of plot must be stupid enough not to realise that maybe this was Fulci's intention to paraphrase a quote make a absolute film that was plot less and is nothing but a succession of images in the tradition Antonin Artolud and the theatre of cruelity.  There is a macabre sense of beauty that surrounds this movie.

I didn't think today's film makers knew who John Hughes was let alone could emulate even his subpar work.  In the 80's, as I was growing up, you had sweet, funny, but honest comedies like Sixteen Candles, Breakfast Club, Pretty In Pink and then other hilarious films like Fasttimes at Ridgemont High.  These films entertained you and kept you wanting more. They were honest with their humour. But then they just disappeared.  Maybe it was that Hughes and Heckerling wanted to make adult comedies like Planes Trains... and Look Who's Talking.  I'm not sure but somewhere along the way they became extinct.  But then something magical happened last year.  After the previous successes of okay films like Can't Harldy Wait and Ten Things I Hate About You, along comes American Pie.  Now American Pie took all that was great about the 80's teen comedies and made it into one hell of a funny film that all generations could enjoy.  It revitalized a somewhat stale market.  And as great as that is, it is also not so great in the way that you have any idiot with a computer trying to cash in on that craze.  Whatever It Takes, is one of those films.  I'm not saying it is absolutely terrible, it's just simply not that great.  But this film will probably go on to gross somewhere around 15 million and that will probably be a profit for the studio and then it will be considered a success.  And then more sub-par films will get made and more teens will go see them and they will not realize that just one generation before them is a library full of the quintessential teen films that are funny, exciting, filled with bathroom humour, nudity, drugs, partying, puking, teens wearing bras on their heads, masturbation, voyeurism, sex sex and more sex.  Films from the 80's were the pioneers of the teen genre and when I read comments in here that a film like this one is  the best teen comedy around   I feel sorry for the kids today if they feel that way because that obviously means that you have not seen some the great films from the 80's.  What a shame!The story is quite simple here.  Maggie and Brian live next door to each other and both are just friends.  Both are attractive people but they don't see the intrigue in one another.  They both either want other gorgeous people in school or are coveted by someone else.  And so when the school jock tells Brian that he can hook him up with Ashley, the schools ditziest, most self centered, conceited but most gorgeous girl, he jumps at the chance.  There is only one catch.  Brian has to help jocko get Maggie. Now Maggie is the best written character in the film.  For the most part she seems genuine and honest.  And she is beautiful.  To put the two of them side by side ( Maggie and Ashley ) one wonders why Brian wouldn't have gone for his friend long ago.  But that is besides the point.  The point is, that this is where the film fails miserably.  Maggie is too real of a character for this film.  She actually looks like she was a substitute character for the film American Pie that was cut at the last minute and then drafted by the creator's of this film.  Why she would fall for the school jock that has as much charm and wit as a doorknob is not fair to her character.  She is better than that.  And this is where the film falls.  Too many situations are just flat and there are too many characters that are just caricatures of a comic book person.  They do things that no other teen does, they act like no other teen does and they talk like no other teen does.

Scott of the New York times, about 10 years after the release of this movie, in response to a new crop of American films using working-class characters, non-professional actors, and rejecting the Hollywood aesthetic. These can largely be traced to the Dogme95 manifesto of the mid-90's, and to the pioneering work of the Dardenne brothers with Rosetta highly acclaimed at Cannes in 1999.Dreamlife of Angels is a classic in its own right, filmed at about the same time as Rosetta. It also takes a few pages from Dogme95, and does a better job following its main principles than its own Danish creators. The only major difference is the use of standard camera equipment, not the frequently annoying home video\/hand-held style as dictated by the Dogme school.This is perhaps one of the few films of the 90's which was able to achieve a complete removal of any sense of distance between the viewer and the screen. Through its intimate and effective cinematography, some phenomenally realistic acting, and total lack of anything one traditionally associates with Hollywood drama (weepy soundtrack, romantic lighting) we almost get to inhabit the same space that the two young female characters do, to experience the same feelings even. Its realism, which matches if not surpasses the French and Italian classics of the late 40's and 50's, is rather brutal at times, but not easily forgettable by any means. With no original music, no voiceovers, flashbacks or fancy cuts (which, if well-made, could also contribute to a great film, just of a different kind), Dreamlife of Angels broke new ground in its unpretentious desire to genuinely move.

This movie, possibly the greatest of its time, blew me out of my chair.  Going to see this movie, I was looking down on it, and expecting another Short Cuts.  Thats not what I got.  To understand this movie, one must see it.  Its almost impossible to explain.  It takes on the idea of that which is losing love, then regaining it.  The list of actors is also star-studded.  Tom Cruise, John C Reilly(Thin Red Line), Julianne Moore(Big Lebowski, End of the Affair), Philip Baker Hall(Hard Eight, Talented Mr. Ripley), and Philip Seymour Hoffman(Big Lebowski, Twister).  Paul Thomas Anderson I believe, has written the best screenplay in movie history.  The character development is incredible.  You must see this movie to realize what I am saying.  This will make you cry, laugh, and get you thinking.  If I could, I would give it a 15\/10.
