It's so deriviate, it's not funny. I was bored through 3\/4ths of it. By the end, when things pick up, I'd really stopped caring about what was going on up on screen.Some reasons1) The animation is *horrid* in places. It's very herky-jerky at times, as if you're watching a film on the Internet via RealPlayer. It seems as though this project was either rushed, or Don Bluth employs hacks for artists. Or both. It even seems as though some Fox executive came to Bluth and said, OK, listen, we need four or five really good set pieces to sell this flick. Everything else is fodder. Just ram this one through as quick as you can.2) The annoying character that John Leguizamo voices. Can you say Jar Jar Binks knock-off?3) This film has the same missing father\/mother\/sister\/family element to it as every other Don Bluth film. Ever see *The Land Before Time*? Or *An American Tail*? You've seen *Titan A.E.* then, just without dinosaurs or Russian field mice as main characters.4) Zero character motivation, which probably has something to do with points raised in 1). Characters do things without any rhyme or reason. There is no shading or back-history, except we know from the outset that the protagonist has some big-time abandonment\/father issues.

There are no less than three longish music montages that go on for no plot-motivated reason. Is this a musical or is it not?6) *Titan A.E.* can't figure out its audience. Is it a film for small kids?

And I'm not saying that I didn't enjoy it. What, are you kidding? This movie is impossible to enjoy. I mean that I did not find it successful.It's the kind of movie that only exists to challenge its audience. I may not have been entirely up to that challenge. Watching a Dogma 95 film on four hours sleep and ten hours work was certainly not the best idea I've ever had. But I was certainly not the only one who felt that the final product was kind of a dud. I saw it in a theater with at least 90 other people, and there were a lot of moans and groans being uttered during the last ten minutes. And this wasn't just from a couple of people who may have accidentally wandered in an art theater by accident. Here are my complaints a film like this has to be saying something, and, in order to work, it has to make me think about the world around me, especially regarding our old friend, the Human Condition. _Rosetta_ only made me think about how exactly the film failed. Basically the moral of the movie is life sucks. It never questions why life sucks. Its conclusion, as far as I can tell, is that it just does. The major obstruction that arose in my mind during it were obvious similarities in theme, style, and character to The Dreamlife of Angles, which I regard as one of the best films of the 1990s. They are both about young women living in the lowlands (_Rosetta_ takes place in Belgium, _Dreamlife_ in Lille, France) who desperately need jobs to live, jobs which are extremely hard to come by. _Dreamlife_ has an edge over _Rosetta_, though. It shows us two different perspectives of this sort of life. One of the two main characters of that film cannot handle the life of poverty, whereas the other finds ways to deal with it. Their characters are well drawn, and we care about them. Heck, I think there are no other two characters from the 1990s (besides maybe Ben and Sera from Leaving Las Vegas) whom I know and love more.Most of _Rosetta_ is just the camera operator following Rosetta as she stomps all over town. She has a personality, but it doesn't go to far. She lives to survive, if that even makes any sense. All of her personality traits arise from a very survival of the fittest attitude (and Rosetta knows that she is not the fittest). This is realistic, to be sure, but it is very hard to care for her. She is so closed off to the world that I could not care all that much about her. If you met her on the street and said hello, I would guess that she would punch you. But look at the bitter woman from _Dreamlife_. Her character generally resides in her bitterness, but she has extra depth. As people usually are when they are bitter, she is very vulnerable and is bitter to, at least partly, keep people from knowing her. Thus, I cared much for her, and I wept profusely for her all throughout the film. Rosetta did not make me feel a thing about her.But here is what I like While I may not have been the least bit compelled by the character Rosetta, the actress playing her was great. This seems paradoxical, but I'll try to explain it. The character as written by the screenwriter has little depth. But there is some depth, and all of it comes from the actress. Her constant stomping leaves her mainly with a sharp frown, but the scenes where she is actually doing something, that actress is amazing. Her face is very expressive, even though the directors seem not to have wanted her to use her facial repertoire during most of the film. There were a couple of scenes which elevated the film for brief periods. There are two very painful scenes where Rosetta tries to stay at her current job. And the very ending, while I was quite disappointed in what the plot was doing with the characters, shows us one of the saddest faces ever filmed.I would never suggest that anyone watch this film, but in the future, if this actress gains any of the fame which she deserves, you may want to hunt this film down. You may dislike it, but it is worth seeing it just for her.So I gave this movie a 7\/10, which is a pretty big stretch.ETA My original review of this film, written in June of 2000, can be found on IMDb. I am frankly embrassed by it (written at age 21), but I'm not going to erase it. It is, indeed, a harsh movie, one that's very single minded and quite small in its scope. It is, though, an extraordinarily powerful film that I thoroughly loved this time around. Emilie Dequenne just floors me. I like a couple of Dardennes films more, but her performance may be the best thing they've ever captured. 9\/10.

You may dislike it, but it is worth seeing it just for her.So I gave this movie a 7\/10, which is a pretty big stretch.ETA My original review of this film, written in June of 2000, can be found on IMDb. I am frankly embrassed by it (written at age 21), but I'm not going to erase it. It is, indeed, a harsh movie, one that's very single minded and quite small in its scope. It is, though, an extraordinarily powerful film that I thoroughly loved this time around. Emilie Dequenne just floors me.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"16 June 2000","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" I can say I definitely did not like _Rosetta_. And I'm not saying that I didn't enjoy it. What, are you kidding? This movie is impossible to enjoy. I mean that I did not find it successful.It's the kind of movie that only exists to challenge its audience. I may not have been entirely up to that challenge. Watching a Dogma 95 film on four hours sleep and ten hours work was certainly not the best idea I've ever had. But I was certainly not the only one who felt that the final product was kind of a dud. I saw it in a theater with at least 90 other people, and there were a lot of moans and groans being uttered during the last ten minutes. And this wasn't just from a couple of people who may have accidentally wandered in an art theater by accident. Here are my complaints a film like this has to be saying something, and, in order to work, it has to make me think about the world around me, especially regarding our old friend, the Human Condition. _Rosetta_ only made me think about how exactly the film failed. Basically the moral of the movie is life sucks. It never questions why life sucks. Its conclusion, as far as I can tell, is that it just does. The major obstruction that arose in my mind during it were obvious similarities in theme, style, and character to The Dreamlife of Angles, which I regard as one of the best films of the 1990s. They are both about young women living in the lowlands (_Rosetta_ takes place in Belgium, _Dreamlife_ in Lille, France) who desperately need jobs to live, jobs which are extremely hard to come by. _Dreamlife_ has an edge over _Rosetta_, though. It shows us two different perspectives of this sort of life. One of the two main characters of that film cannot handle the life of poverty, whereas the other finds ways to deal with it. Their characters are well drawn, and we care about them. Heck, I think there are no other two characters from the 1990s (besides maybe Ben and Sera from Leaving Las Vegas) whom I know and love more.Most of _Rosetta_ is just the camera operator following Rosetta as she stomps all over town. She has a personality, but it doesn't go to far. She lives to survive, if that even makes any sense. All of her personality traits arise from a very survival of the fittest attitude (and Rosetta knows that she is not the fittest). This is realistic, to be sure, but it is very hard to care for her. She is so closed off to the world that I could not care all that much about her. If you met her on the street and said hello, I would guess that she would punch you. But look at the bitter woman from _Dreamlife_. Her character generally resides in her bitterness, but she has extra depth. As people usually are when they are bitter, she is very vulnerable and is bitter to, at least partly, keep people from knowing her. Thus, I cared much for her, and I wept profusely for her all throughout the film. Rosetta did not make me feel a thing about her.But here is what I like While I may not have been the least bit compelled by the character Rosetta, the actress playing her was great. This seems paradoxical, but I'll try to explain it. The character as written by the screenwriter has little depth. But there is some depth, and all of it comes from the actress. Her constant stomping leaves her mainly with a sharp frown, but the scenes where she is actually doing something, that actress is amazing. Her face is very expressive, even though the directors seem not to have wanted her to use her facial repertoire during most of the film. There were a couple of scenes which elevated the film for brief periods. There are two very painful scenes where Rosetta tries to stay at her current job. And the very ending, while I was quite disappointed in what the plot was doing with the characters, shows us one of the saddest faces ever filmed.I would never suggest that anyone watch this film, but in the future, if this actress gains any of the fame which she deserves, you may want to hunt this film down.

Replace the giant crabs, snakes and spiders with three heads by some great modern looking aliens and we got PITCH BLACK. With a diference...in this movie the human characters are interesting, have personality and we end up caring for them, much more than we expected, after seeing dozens of alien monster movies through the years.In fact the characters was the thing in the movie that surprised me more, after all i already was expecting good special effects. In fact i wasn´t even counting to get much more out of this movie than just some good action sequences. I was surprised to find such well writen parts for such diferent characters, in a movie that didn´t asked for it to make money in the box-office.And i loved the fact that there were no Hollywood superstars in it.

In fact i don´t care much for this type of MTV edditing style, ( i didn´t liked it in Matrix for example altough it´s a good movie), but in this case i think it works wonders for PITCH BLACK because it doesn´t exagerates, trying to give style, instead of being used just to tell a story.In fact the direction gives a nice personal feel to this movie, and we can see the director trully likes sci-fi.

But i can see why it failled there, first it´s a very crude movie in its graphic depiction of some scenes. Even the more normal everyday scenes are not the usual politicaly correct ones, from a filming perspective. This is not a politicaly correct movie at all and by doing that it stays true to its story and specialy to its atmosphere wich is incredible, but at the same time makes this filme very hard to classify within a genre. BELOVED is another one of those movies that must be hell to publicize in America. Is it a drama ? An horror movie ? A supernatural thriller ? An historical drama ? Well it´s all of that and nothing of that at the same time. But sure is creepy and very disturbing at times. By the end of it i was still in shock, not from the tension and almost movie magic, but for having just seen one of the most original  stories i ever seen lately. One thing is for sure. I´m going to read the original novel !The first seconds of the movie are a rush, and we clearly get the idea that we are going to see something we didn´t expected. And talking about politacaly incorrect, that initial scene with the dog, is enough to make most people leave the room imediately. Particulary the ones who thought BELOVED was going to be THE COLOR PURPLE part II, wich is not ! Believe me.This movie is very hard to describe tough.  It´s a period drama, wich deals with slavery in the 1800´s inside rural America, but by telling a story of slaves and ex-slaves, goes into a very original ghost story territory that i never seen anywhere before i saw this story, (and i´ve read a lot of good ghost stories). I don´t know how to explain this movie to anyone who hasn´t seen it or doesn´t know anything about it, without spoiling the story, the drama and the horror in it. And believe me ,the horror in this movie allied with a mistery is all the fun...even if i might sound a little sadistic by putting it this way...This is a very creepy movie, altough not in the usual hollywood horror style. There´s no scares, but we get totaly unconfortable during the whole screening specialy when we meet the character of Beloved. But to give a brief idea of the plot, this is the story of a woman , who lived in a house with her daughter. And despite their house was haunted by a spirit, the woman refuse to leave the place. One day a man appears, an old friend of her and this is going to trigger some terrifying memories. Then a misterious girl with grave mental problems one day arrives alone at the house, also alone and all become a little like a family. But something was not right... And i can´t tell no more without spoiling the plot so i´ll shut up now.Just be prepared. This movie gets more into your nerves than any recent horror movie in years. And at the same time is a great drama and a brilliant exposure on slavery in rural America of the 19th century.And the actors are fantastic ! Movies like that show how injust and fake the Oscars are. Everyone here deserved to walk from this movie with a golden statuet. Ophra Winfrey, Danny Glover and Kimberly Elise who plays Ophra´s daughter, all do a superior job in every way. And Thandie Newton who plays Beloved ,will creep you to your bones sometimes more than any Poltergeist scenes in the haunted house. Everybody in this movie should be proud.The photography is beautifull, and Jonathan Demme keeps everything moving through the almost 3 hours this movie has, surprising everyone at every shot. This is his best movie. Oh, and the soundtrack couldn´t be better or more original, all based in strange chants and African drums and rithmms.How can a movie like this have failled in America ?!

The Titan is a gigantic ship that will somehow change the role of humans in the universe.  The movie follows Cale,  the son of one of the scientists who developed the Titan,  as he is recruited by former military commander Korso to hunt for the Titan.  His father hid the ship to save it from destruction by the Drej and placed a map to its location within Cale's hand,  leaving him as the only way of locating it and making him a target of the relentless Drej.I was anxious to see this movie after seeing the effects on display in the trailer,  and it certainly delivered in the eye candy department.  The computer generated scenes are quite entertaining.  The cat and mouse chase that takes place in a field of gigantic ice crystals near the end of the film is a treat to watch.  The atmosphere was very well textured,  with a very gritty feel to the environments that were brought across quite well.The rest of the package? Well...The characters are all done with traditional 2d animation and, while I thought were technically well animated,  seemed a bit out of place against the high tech backdrop generated by the rendered scenery.  They are without a doubt alien in appearance,  but in a way that is distinctly...Bluthian (for lack of a better word).  This studio has a style all their own,  and it is very apparent in the character designs.  I felt at times that I was watching Secret of Nimh instead of a space opera.  This, I felt, was only slightly annoying.  All of the characters are flawlessly voiced and easy to like, however,  and I certainly had no complaints about the humans providing the voices.The soundtrack does get a bit intrusive at times.  Several scenes seem inserted simply to serve as a visual backdrop for the grunge inspired songs. While none of them are really annoying,  and the visuals are quite nice, they eventually start to intrude on what would have been a perfectly interesting story all by itself.And the story...  It is quite compelling and well set up early in the movie. However,  not enough backstory is really given to answer all the questions you will have about what motivated whom to do what they do.  The Drej are certainly the most alien looking race in the movie and easy to loathe,  but they are left a fairly faceless bunch whose only words are their leader's cliched orders to wipe out humans.  The reason for their relentless hatred of the human race is NEVER explained.  There is a scene where it seems this would have fit very well,  so perhaps some story elements were cut in the interest of time.  This was my biggest complaint with the movie however. The device that sets up the entire rest of the rather interesting plot is never really explained!  After learning of the Titan's purpose (and extrapolating that use to other races besides the human one),  it's slightly more apparent why the Drej would seek to destroy our species,  but their motivations are still left very murky in the end.  There is one plot twist that comes completely out of the blue and while the character's explanation is satisfying enough,  it still happens so quickly as to be a bit unsettling.If you were wondering about the child friendliness of this animated movie, there's nothing older children won't have already seen on prime time television.  But I'd consider it perhaps a bit -too- violent (lots of gunplay) to take my five year old to see.An entertaining if disposable joyride for a couple of hours.  It won't be remembered as well as The Iron Giant (my favorite animated film) or much of the more cerebral anime fare,  but I felt overall it was certainly worth the price of admission.

The power of this film is the chemistry between Nic and Meg , and the atmosphere created by Brad Silberling. The romance is very sweet and believable, played into perfection by the leads, and the atmosphere of the 'city of angels' is captivating.               The only thing else a film like this needs is a suitable ending, which simply wasn't there. The fist hour-and-a-half was mysteriously uplifting, and the ending was downright depressing. It didn't work for me. Still, it is much better and definitely much deeper than your usual romantic drama and it never fails to entertain. Let's hope the DVD has an alternative ending.

Natural Born Killers is one of these films. Happiness is certainly disturbing. Nobody, however, could make the case that, like Killers, it is gratuitous. This is because the disturbing elements are what make up the story. For example, one character is a petaphile. The idea of this is disturbing. We never actually see him rape children, but it is spoken about. In a movie like Killers, you would see it to some extent. Here you never do. It's not necessarry. So it's a wierd subject matter that is handled very tastefully. The story is kind of a Short Cuts\/Playing By Heart where there are a bunch of stories interwined and connected to each other. The reason the movie is so great is both because of it's stories and because of it's humor. You will never see this many interesting stories together. Movies aren't that smart. Ussually, if you get one or two good stories, like in Four Rooms, the other two are lousy. If all four were great, the movie would be incredible. Well, in Happiness, all four are great. And more. The humor comes from great characters and even better dialogue. Lara Flynn Boyle is hilarious. This movie is great. But not easy to handle.

Do they remember that it was about unfolding plots and secret espionage and real characters?No, I think not.Mission Impossible II bares little resemblance to it's predecessor, which I found a guilty pleasure and intriguing, despite it's convoluted plot. This time around, John Woo takes over the reigns as director from Brian De Palma and turns it into a visual rollercoaster of action and stunts that will surely win over audiences (partly because they can't remember how good the original series was).The story involves a deadly virus called Chymera (spelling?) that was accidentaly created by a pair of Russian scientists that work for Australian pharmaceutical giant Biocyte. To avoid spoilers, I must skip certain elements of the story. Anyway, an evil ex-IMF agent called Sean Ambrose is out to steal the virus and the antidote, thus infecting people with the devastating disease and forcing them to pay for the cure. Meanwhile, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is given the task of stopping Ambrose with the help of Sean's ex-flame, and Hunt's now-flame, Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton). She is to infiltrate Ambrose's scheme by restarting her relationship with him and feeding information to Hunt. Ethan also has the help of IMF agents Billy Baird (John Polson) and Luther Stickwell (Ving Rhames, reorising his role from Mission Impossible). Soon, Hunt and his team are racing against the clock to stop Ambrose and to save Nyah, who is in great peril.Now, its pretty useless that Cruise plays Ethan Hunt in this film he resembles practically in no way the character from the first film. In Mission Impossible, Hunt was a cold, edgy point man who was vaunerable but smart. He wasn't unstoppable, but he had guts and fury in his blood. In Mission Impossible II, Hunt is basically James Bond super slick, super cool, he immediatley gets the girl and has tons of explosive toys to use in dispatching Ambrose and his team. Not only that, but he has become a martial arts wizard who is basically a one man task force. When infiltrating a business deal with Ambrose and the Biocyte CEO, he goes through waves and waves of guards with acrobatic moves, hardly breaking a sweat. Hunt is an entertaining character but is nothing like the one we saw in the first film. Then why label this a sequel? Well, the first one made about $452 million and has a catchy theme song so why not take advantage?This film also has a confusing plot, although not nearly as much as the first one. It involves a lot more of the brief masking that we saw in Mission Impossible and it becomes very predictable and even rediculous. I won't spoil it, but in one scene where a mask change takes place, it is evident that Hunt would have had to brought a mask for himself and another character and a voice-changer for that character to an event in which he is not sure will happen or not! And the voice changers too! It is a little over-the-top rediculous that a microchip strip (like a piece of tape) across the vocal cords can manipulate your voice to that of anyone (like the voice-changer in Scream 3). If you remember the scene in Mission Impossible where Hunt is disguised as Jim Phelps (Jon Voight, the bad guy), he does not say a word. How could he? He is still just Ethan Hunt wearing a mask!Also, this sequel feels just like a vehicle for Cruise to look cool and blow things up nicely. Sure, with a huge star like Cruise almost any film with him is a vehicle but remember Mission Impossible's fine supporting players? Jon Voight, Emmanuelle Beart, Kristin Scott Thomas, Emilio Estevez (who actually works well), Vanessa Redgrave, Jean Reno and Ving Rhames (who had a much better role in the first one). I felt that Rhames was wasted as Stickwell, who offered very small comic relief and who's main purpose was to jump out of an exploding van, run all over Sydney searching for Nyah at Hunt's command or getting pissed because someone put a hole in my Versaci. The cast in the sequel is good Thandie Newton stands around looking either bravely defiant or innocent and scared, which she does very well, and Dougray Scott is a pleasant surprise as the nasty villan. Anthony Hopkins is perhaps the best as he takes over the job as Hunt's IMF chief.But these multiple shortcomings are more than made up for woth the action. Oh, the action of John Woo. When Hunt executes his high-tech invasion of Biocyte, Woo turns the dogs loose in a blazing twin-barrelled fire fight that is absolutley thrilling. While I was kind of irked to see Cruise playing super cool through the rest of the movie, when the action came, I reveled in the magnificence. And how cool he is kung-fuing his way through enemies, throwing grenades with ease and the end motorcycle chase. WOW. Hunt takes off on a motorcycle and two or three SUVs filled with Ambrose's nasties follow, along with Ambrose on a chopper of his own. The SUV drives across a small bridge, where it is met by Stickwell's gunfire. The SUV explodes and takes some of the bridge with it. And from the fire, we see Hunt, super cool, flying through the flames on the cycle. WOW.So, expect something quite different from the original film and in my opinion, something not as satisfying. But if you are looking for something to hold you over until the next 007 film, this is the ticket. Most of the film barely works, if at all, but Woo puts on quite a show. This film puts him up there with today's best American action artists Spielberg, McTiernan, Cameron and Donner.
