I would say that this is some barely believable fiction. Ironically this is a true story. Of course since this is a movie some things were probably changed for the dramatic purposes , yet the main core of the story is true.The main problem is with the unlikable heroes. I'm sorry , but Hutton's decision seems to be made from stupidity. Was he really that naive ? Didn't he understood that politics is a dirty game where everyone is spying and manipulating the others ? Never was and never will be fair game ? That not only USA , but other countries aren't saints in any way ? That he was betraying his own country ? If he wanted to make change he should go to press. His intentions maybe were good , but in the end he only endangered his own country. And asking for help someone as irresponsible as a drug addict&#x85; He should know that this would end really bad.The movie sticks to the vision of Hutton's character being a really idealistic crusader and Penn being an sympathetic moron. I did care about them when things started to go really bad for them &#x96; the paranoia attacks , the fear , the sense of hopeless , the danger of losing your life. Schlesinger does show a great directing skills from time to time. The scene where gun appears on the table and the doors are locked , searching for the bugs inside the bird , the brutal interrogation in Mexico , the sad end for both of our heroes. There are also some funny scenes here , mostly involving Penn's character . The scene when he proposes a drug deal to Russians really tells you how f***ed up he is.The music by Pat Metheny is good , even if it's mostly one and the same theme appearing through the whole movie. The song This is not America by David Bowie and Pat Metheny is great and was quite a hit back in the 80's.Sean Penn is great as the drug addict . He really acts like drugs are the only thing he thinks about. His whiny voice , loose attitude and big mouth make him a memorable character. The Oscar nominee would do him justice. He dominates the screen.Timothy Hutton is great too , giving a depth to his character. He's lost , noble and honest character who lost his way. When he tells near the end of the movie why he did it I really believed him. Disliked him, but still believed him. He was able to make an cliché character real.There is a solid support by veteran actor Pat Hingle (Batman) as Hutton's father , Lori Singer (Footloose) as Hutton's girlfriend and especially from David Suchet (TV series Poirot) as the Russian spy.The Falcon and snowman is long (2 hours) , yet never boring movie . It's an interesting document about real life story with some nice moments in it. It's not a great movie by any way , because it's too shallow and one sided drama , yet it's entertaining enough to give it a chance. I give it 6\/10.

It isn't a laugh out loud, roll in the aisles funny movie. It is an incredibly adorable, pinch its cheeks, sugary sweet chick flick that doesn't try to be anything else. It does try to throw in just a tiny little dirty joke here and there but immediately covers its mouth and giggles nervously about it. You won't find any Oscar winning performances but you won't find any eye rolling performances either (except for maybe being just too insanely cute.) The film is one step away from being acted out by a team of homeless kittens and bunnies. There are some genuinely funny moments and it also follows the necessary recipe for a well received romantic comedy\/chick flick and follows it to the letter right down to the grand gesture of love at the hand that will have sensitive movie watchers tearing up at. I can't say much more than that because Never Been Kissed should be exactly what you would expect from it. It is a movie I have watched more than once without batting an eye over it, it is one of wife's favourite films and I can understand why because it is simply just dang likable.And that in a nutshell is also Drew Barrymore. She is just dang likable, adorable, sweet and innocent...looking. Once a wild child and now America's sweetheart usually in films and it works for her. This character takes every day innocence to a new level because she is book smart but so out of touch with romance. She makes it believable and she makes even some of the minor plot holes seem reasonable...especially the constant flirting she does with her high school teacher which is addressed in a small way but mostly ignored. Her romantic counterpart is played by the ridiculously handsome and yet average joe seeming Michael Vartan. Their chemistry is very good though they are very different characters. They connect intellectually and it works very well for the movie. I still feel like Vartan is a little drab at times but nothing that holds back the film. David Arquette is, surprisingly so, quite good as Barrymore's caring and popular brother who happens to have not made much of himself. He has a small role, definitely supporting but it really is a good part for him and he adds something to the story. Him and Barrymore are terrific together. Supporting cast are all quite good including Molly Shannon (who I find hopelessly irritating but this is a role that actually was okay for her,) John C Reilly, Garry Marshall, Jeremy Jordan, Marley Shelton, Jordon Ladd and even Leelee Sobieski somehow pulls off an excruciatingly stereotypical and predictable character quite well.If someone told me they hated this film I could sort of see were they were coming from. Although, I'm not sure what sort of expectations they had from it because you can read the back or watch a trailer and essentially know what you're in for. Still, there just isn't a lot of depth here. This isn't a smart film but so what!! We need movies like this because they are simple fun and sweet and enjoyable for a little relaxation. There is no intensity here at all but at the same time the story works and has a great pacing. Raja Gosnell, best known now for successfully bringing The Smurfs to live action and big screens, has a talent for fluff. That might sound like an insult but it isn't meant to be. He creates light fluffy adventures and stories that are fun and enjoyable and Never Been Kissed is simply enjoyable.

It's not at all that bad actually, though it couldn't kept some things that made of Shishinin no Samurai a great and possibly one of the best films ever made, one of that things would be the fantastic ending and the rich and involving character development, both aspects that can be easily noticeable for those who watched both films.For the standards of the American Westerns, this can be considered a good effort, but as a remake, it's disappointing and distorts a lot of things from the original. I don't want to spoil the original here, but i guarantee that it has much more details and is an infinitely times richest and involving film. You really care about the characters, because each one has a distinct and powerful personality, and you can easily follow each one. The acting was also way too underwhelming, it seems that the characters of this film were all apathetic and slow, it was weird. I couldn't care less about these emotionless characters. Of course, the only exception was_ironically_ the villain, portrayed by the excellent Eli Wallach. He did the only character that i felt interested in, unfortunately he don't has that much of a screen time. Still, he is much more of an active character than all the others in that film.

I never fully understood why people hate this movie so much. Here is why (I will also be speaking a bit about the other two prequels)First off, casting Anakin as a kid was an excellent choice on the part of George Lucas. COME BACK HERE RIGHT NOW! He's much more impressionable as a kid than he would be as a teen or young adult. When everyone in the movie keeps stepping in front of him and forcing him to conform to their way or their point of view, it helps build this feeling of powerlessness which he grows to despise and fear throughout the rest of the trilogy. I mean, he starts off as a slave (already powerless) who wins his freedom from his owner who refuses to let his mother leave with him. He feels powerless because he can't change Watto's mind.

Titanic is, without a doubt, a strong film, a compelling story, a attracting one. I myself have a big love\/hate relationship with this movie. In 1997, when it was released, and cynical 90's where at it's highest, I knew this movie was not going to be for me, I knew which was going to be my reaction to this film. We all knew James Cameron, he made The Terminator in 1984, Aliens in 1986, and Terminator 2 in 1991, all of them decent (not great) action flicks, with one common denominator, LOTS OF MONEY. And that is James Cameron about, he spends and earns tons of money, because (Regardless of your love or your hate for him) he makes the right choices. Avatar sucked, just putting it out there. But what was that worked so much about Titanic?. We might say that Leo DiCaprio or Kate Winslet, or the huge budget of which we where all informed of. I want to think that it was the Leo-Mania, of women that time, after Romeo+Juliet and Who's eating Gilbert Grape, or the fact that it got unbelievable amount of money for it advertising, or the good visual effects, or the Oscar swept, or the lazy, easy to entertain story, or the bland characters, which everybody could be identified with, cause it's easy to identify with so general personalities. I wanna believe that, but it is not true in a whole. Well, it's true in part, but the greatest factor of the success of this film, was truly it 's quality. Not it's story, nor it's characters, those where clichéd and bland (But entertaining, it was an entertaining story told a million times, not like Avatar, a lousy story told a million times). The fact that Rose and Jack know each other for about two days and decide to risk their lives for each other is pretty distracting, but, what the hell, Disney did that to us in all of it's movies. So, why 7 stars if I think all this crap about this movie? Because this movie is great, really great, I don't want it to be, but just look at it, it's so big, it's so fancy, the costume, the production, the visual effects, the amazing cinematography, the pacing, everything was correct, and makes you feel this three hours film like a two hours film, you want more, and not because it let you expecting more, just because it was amazing, and you want to see that again. So, to sum up. I don't see this as a great story, and I don't believe characters where great, but technically it was one of the most complete movies ever released. Look at the Oscars it won. Best Picture, Best director,Best editing, Best Cinematography, Best sound, Best sound effects, Best costume design, Best art direction, Best Visual effects, Best song and best score. And I agree with all of them, I think it is amazing visually and has a great score, even if I hate My heart will go on (Maybe it was Celine's Dion fault), and acting wasn't awful neither, regardless of the blandness of the characters, Kate Winslet was very good, Billy Zane was a nice over the top villain, and Leo DiCaprio was Okey (Just okay). So, I really like this movie, I can watch it over and over, even do it's not at all perfect, or it has way more cons than pros, it's hypnotizing, its easy to watch, it was made with a lot of effort and it shows, it's full atmosphere, full visual, and a relaxing story and characters.

I believe that this was only Denzel Washington's 2nd film. WOW, can you ever tell what a powerhouse talent and presence that he was to become. Adolph Caesar who rightfully received the Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance was fantastic!I think also what really makes this film resonate more strongly is that, as Jewison said in the commentary, being either white or black, many people can truly relate to these characters. He also said that this was probably the first film which gave such a substantial insight into the African-American psyche of those at the time and especially the ones in the military. I also appreciated the excellent theme of racism within one's own people.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"7 December 2013","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie, going for about two hours, is just so packed full of everything. The movie follows two people who join the star forces to go to war against a race of arachnids. They join to become citizens (for one of the ways to become a citizen in the federation is to spend a term in the armed forces, that is if you survive), but while they are there, Earth goes to war with the arachnids and their lives change. It focuses around three friends who still remain friends, but drift apart as one becomes a pilot, one an intelligence agent, and one a grunt, yet it is predictable as one can see that these three people remain the focus of the movie (or two as the intelligence officer disappears when they join the army, only appearing every so often to remind us that he is still around).The question is, is Starship Troopers a pro-war film or an anti-war film. There seems to be arguments that support both sides. First we will have a look at the pro-war aspect of the movie. Starship Troopers no doubts glorifies war. The whole thing about joining the army to become a citizen is a very pro-war sentiment. The idea is that if one is willing to risk their lives for their country then one is entitled to become a citizen of that country. The main characters have been described as being Captain and Miss America, while the iceman is Captain America's side kick. These main characters are the typical glorified Hollywood heroes who cannot die. Even though there are times where is seems likely they will die, they don't, they are the heroes. The supporting characters around them such as Diz and Micheal Ironside, die in horrific ways, but these two main characters, who see the action, remain alive throughout the movie. It has been commented that if this movie was an anti-war film then the main characters would have died in a pointless way that does not forward the war. The philosophy of the society is also very pro-war, it is right to fight for what you believe in, and that violence is the only way to solve problems. The trailer also opens with, in every lifetime there is a cause that one should fight for. Supporting the anti-war sentiments is the pure reality of war that is shown in the movie. In Starship Troopers we see the camera pan across battlefields littered with dead bodies. These bodies are been hideously mauled and ripped to shreds. We watch limbs get ripped off by the hordes of critters that come swarming over the hills, and we see loved ones die in the arms of their lovers. This movie is extremely violent and very blatant, it is not one for those who cannot handle the sight of blood, or scenes of mass carnage. Another anti-war sentiment seems to be the nature of the news reports. It opens with a camera man on the front-line and we are watching troopers getting ripped to shreds by the arachnids. This is a very 20th century way of reporting on a war where the journalists are right in the thick of the action. This seems to be an attack against the war reporting is conducting this era.Yet all of this blood and gore seems to serve a purpose, and that is as anti-bug propaganda. This propaganda is hammed up in the scene where we see children squashing bugs and a voice over saying and we should all do our bit for the war effort. This may seem really stupid but in both World War I and World War II Germans in Australia were detained because it was for the war effort. South Australia has a large German community in the Barossa Valley and Handorf, and they experienced a lot of prejudice during this era. Another anti-war sentiment is the way the humans probe the bugs and the bugs probe the humans. When the bugs do it we say, yuck kill them, yet when we do it we say, yay, we're probing the bugs!. This exposes our hypocritical nature when it comes to war. They even comment in the movie they're just probing us as we are probing them, yet with us it is good and with them it is bad.I guess the most important point to consider is the director Paul Verhoeven. He is described as being a typical American Director which means that he gives us what we see and there is little in the way of thought behind the movie. I guess the possible statement that comes from this movie is, war is good if you are fighting for what you believe in, but if you do this is the consequence.

They join to become citizens (for one of the ways to become a citizen in the federation is to spend a term in the armed forces, that is if you survive), but while they are there, Earth goes to war with the arachnids and their lives change. It focuses around three friends who still remain friends, but drift apart as one becomes a pilot, one an intelligence agent, and one a grunt, yet it is predictable as one can see that these three people remain the focus of the movie (or two as the intelligence officer disappears when they join the army, only appearing every so often to remind us that he is still around).The question is, is Starship Troopers a pro-war film or an anti-war film. There seems to be arguments that support both sides. First we will have a look at the pro-war aspect of the movie. Starship Troopers no doubts glorifies war. The whole thing about joining the army to become a citizen is a very pro-war sentiment. The idea is that if one is willing to risk their lives for their country then one is entitled to become a citizen of that country. The main characters have been described as being Captain and Miss America, while the iceman is Captain America's side kick. These main characters are the typical glorified Hollywood heroes who cannot die. Even though there are times where is seems likely they will die, they don't, they are the heroes. The supporting characters around them such as Diz and Micheal Ironside, die in horrific ways, but these two main characters, who see the action, remain alive throughout the movie. It has been commented that if this movie was an anti-war film then the main characters would have died in a pointless way that does not forward the war. The philosophy of the society is also very pro-war, it is right to fight for what you believe in, and that violence is the only way to solve problems. The trailer also opens with, in every lifetime there is a cause that one should fight for. Supporting the anti-war sentiments is the pure reality of war that is shown in the movie. In Starship Troopers we see the camera pan across battlefields littered with dead bodies. These bodies are been hideously mauled and ripped to shreds. We watch limbs get ripped off by the hordes of critters that come swarming over the hills, and we see loved ones die in the arms of their lovers. This movie is extremely violent and very blatant, it is not one for those who cannot handle the sight of blood, or scenes of mass carnage. Another anti-war sentiment seems to be the nature of the news reports. It opens with a camera man on the front-line and we are watching troopers getting ripped to shreds by the arachnids. This is a very 20th century way of reporting on a war where the journalists are right in the thick of the action. This seems to be an attack against the war reporting is conducting this era.Yet all of this blood and gore seems to serve a purpose, and that is as anti-bug propaganda. This propaganda is hammed up in the scene where we see children squashing bugs and a voice over saying and we should all do our bit for the war effort. This may seem really stupid but in both World War I and World War II Germans in Australia were detained because it was for the war effort. South Australia has a large German community in the Barossa Valley and Handorf, and they experienced a lot of prejudice during this era. Another anti-war sentiment is the way the humans probe the bugs and the bugs probe the humans. When the bugs do it we say, yuck kill them, yet when we do it we say, yay, we're probing the bugs!. This exposes our hypocritical nature when it comes to war. They even comment in the movie they're just probing us as we are probing them, yet with us it is good and with them it is bad.I guess the most important point to consider is the director Paul Verhoeven. He is described as being a typical American Director which means that he gives us what we see and there is little in the way of thought behind the movie. I guess the possible statement that comes from this movie is, war is good if you are fighting for what you believe in, but if you do this is the consequence.

","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"7 December 2013","score":"","review":" Cruising is one of the most controversial films in the last 40 years, up there with Straw dogs, Clockwork orange, and Natural born killers. The film follows police officer Steve Burns (Al Pacino) who has been assigned by Captain Edelson (Paul Sorvino) to go undercover into a gay S&M clubs to find a serial killer who has been murdering men after having sex with them. The film has many graphic scenes of Pacino in these bars observing men engaging in various sex acts. Pacino gives a solid performance as a cop in over his head, who can't quite make out how he should feel after spending night after night in these clubs. After several weeks undercover, Burns becomes emotionally and physically distant from his girlfriend (Nancy Allen). Because of the nature of being undercover, Burns can't disclose what he is experiencing, seeing, feeling, etc. There are strong hints that Pacino might be experimenting sexually with some of the men in the bars he has frequented and that there might be more then one killer. The movie is extremely ambiguous about the identity of the killer (or killers) and the ending only leaves you more mystified. One of the controversies of the film was that there was 40 minutes of film that was censored and cut out. When director William Friedkin wanted to add the deleted 40 minutes several years later when the film was released on DVD, but the footage was missing. Friedkin has had several explanations on what exactly was in the footage. He has claimed it was just more footage of gay sex in the s&m bars and other times that there was also some scenes suggesting who the killer may or may not be. You have to give Pacino credit for taking on the role even if he probably wasn't the best choice. (Gere had been offered the role but passed). Gay rights groups were justifiably outraged that one the first movies about homosexuals would be a film about a gay man who is so repulsed about his own sexuality that he murders the men he has sex with. Another controversy was the perceived inference that the S&M scene is common among gay men and that they spend their nights partying and having indiscriminate sex. I don't really believe the latter was true, but you can understand why film was so controversial.

Even so, when a Star Trek movie comes to the screen, I do drag myself out simply to see what it is like. My brother also wanted to see it so I decided that I would, and I am glad that I did because it was far better than the other two.Insurrection is a plot that twists and invites the viewer to work out what is going on. As well as being science fiction, it takes a far better approach that simply flashing Borg in front of us hoping to impress us. Instead it opens up with a problem and everything slowly unravels as the movie goes on.The movie begins on a planet among a peaceful society and the Federation, using personal cloaking devices, are monitoring these people. Suddenly Data malfunctions and reveals these spies to the village. The Enterprise is asked for the schematics and instead of simply giving it to Star Fleet, they travel to the planet to see what the problem is. The planet happens to be located in the middle of a large nebula and as such no communication out is possible, thus what is going on on the planet is hidden from the Federation, even though one of the admirals is involved.The thing about the planet is that the rings produce rejuvenating rays which restores body tissue. This is the secret of eternal youth which everybody is looking for. Such a benefit always comes with a disadvantage &#x96; and this seems to be a common plot in Star Trek &#x96; all other problems have been solved but people still die, so what can we do about it.This mimics humanities fear of death. They take everything away but there is still death so they decide to create a way in which to eliminate that as well. What Star Trek really is is humanities desire to live in a better world without having to submit to a supreme authority &#x96; God. I have had arguments regarding the morality of Star Trek with numerous trekkie friends and will always remain firm that the reason that I hate Star Trek is that they are openly against religion and claim that humanity can solve all of the world's problems itself. This I just cannot believe because in 6000 years of recorded human history we may have advanced technologically and culturally, but the same problems that faced our ancient ancestors face us today, so what makes us think we can solve them in a few hundred years. Maybe we argue that we have been evolving, but all we have to do is look at the social decay within America as everybody becomes hyper-individualistic to realise that this is not the case.I did like this movie and was suitably impressed, even with one that Jonathon Frakes directed. I was not suitably impressed with some of Frakes' directions as they generally seem nice and idealistic and generally sickening, but this was good. If they can keep up the quality of such films then I will be returning to see them.

Stanley Kubrick, the great innovator known for spending years on his craft had been surpassed by many award winning movies. Still like many of Stanley's movies that are initially despised upon release, are years later lauded as masterpieces beyond the scope of a mere camera lens. Full Metal Jacket, I feel represents Stanley working at his most un-prohibited in terms of humanities greatest flaw. After seeing through the bitter eyes of General Kirk Douglas in Paths Of Glory (1957), and the Superpowers of Dr. Strangelove (1964) we finally get to see what really matters. The soldiers coming to terms In a world of sh*t.The first act shows our cast of heroes begin their vigorous training into dehumanised killers, led by the cruel, but fair leader Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (Real life drill instructor Lee Ermy). Training goes well for all, except one Private definitely lacking in any physical advantages and whose shortcomings begin to cost the squad dearly. Eventually our lead character Joker (Matthew Modine), is eventually dispatched into Vietnam. From then on there are reunions with former comrades, sadistic peers and total disregard for human life on both sides. Tense and unnerving, the performances are worth the reasons of viewing alone. Whilst not the most quotable and recognised of the Vietnam depictions, Kubrick's camera-work is as sublime as ever, and it's hard not to be totally engrossed on how London's Beckton Gas Works got turned into Vietnamese soil.Final Verdict Essential Kubrick.

He meets Inspector Jean-Pierre Richard (Tchéky Karyo), a corrupt French police detective and tricks Liu into believing he is simply providing reconnaissance of a meet involving Mr Big when he is planning to use two prostitutes as a rouse to kill Mr Big and frame Li for it. Li realises he has been set up escapes from the hotel with a surveillance tape showing Richard shooting Mr Big and tries to clear his name. Along the way he encounters an American prostitute little knowing that their paths have crossed before.The story for this film was from Jet Li and it was produced by Luc Besson. It is primarily a martial arts action fight film for Li without much CGI or wire work and Li really delivers. From Besson you get that what is now a trademark Besson style of an outsider entering France and getting involved in a mystery and action where bad guys need to be dispatched with assistance from usually a female. It is almost a prototype Taken film.The best fight sequence is in the police training room when Li is taken aback to discover they are doing karate training.However the film has too many lapses of logic. Karyo is a great bad guy but we see him shoot civilians out in the open, surely someone would twig he is corrupt. We also have scenes of someone shooting at Li from a hotel lobby with two machine guns and again no one at the French Police raises questions. Bridget Fonda looks miscast as the prostitute and it would had been better if her character was French.
