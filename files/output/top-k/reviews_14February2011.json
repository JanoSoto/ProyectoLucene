[{"date":"14 February 2011","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Requiem is not a movie for the faint of heart or easily offended, this coming from a discriminating viewer who adores movies that showcase society's gritty and grimy underbelly; and while it really has no other movie to compare itself against, I'd say the shock value and wow factor are on par with that of City of God. In a move of inspired cinematic form, we are led into the story slowly, providing four unique perspectives of life in a quasi-forgotten landscape near Coney Island. Through a deliberately slow buildup we are made to see these peoples' dreams of grandeur blossom for the briefest of instants and just as swiftly, wither and die. Each person has their own utopia in mind, but all are afflicted with a debilitating condition, addiction. And as each spirals deeper into the depths of their cravings they are forced to take drastic measures to get their fix. The endings, in my mind, are quite appropriate as they all find themselves in their own private hell. As I said at the beginning, there is no glamor, no glitz to be found here, just cold reality and it truly is striking, not a movie that most will watch casually, but one that I'd highly recommend to anyone looking for a well-produced, chilling reminder of the harsh realities of the real world.
