It wears its references on its sleeve, and there's a lot of discussion of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and even a couple of huge references to The Thing. The cast is quite good (amongst others, Elijah Wood, Josh Hartnett, Robert Patrick, Piper Laurie, Bebe Neuwirth, Famke Janssen, Salma Hayek and Jon Stewart, who would start hosting The Daily Show within a few days of this movie's debut), though the stereotypical teenage characters are sometimes bland (of course, the movie plays so much with the concept of stereotypes that I don't think anything is done unironically). It also has a really cool monster. Definitely a fun flick.
