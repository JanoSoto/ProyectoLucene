[{"date":"15 July 2011","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Scream 3 has some major problems but I didn't think it was that bad. The production values are great, the score and sound are still effective and the direction and performances are credible. Not to mention GhostFace returns and is still as iconic and creepy as ever. However, the story is unoriginal and rather pedestrian, and the script is weak with too many unfunny and clichéd lines. When it comes to the scares, there were moments but too many weren't as strong or as genuine. The ending is also silly and predictable, and apart from GhostFace the characters are not as interesting. All in all, not bad but disappointing. 5\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"15 July 2011","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Scream 3 has some major problems but I didn't think it was that bad.

And it was a worthy sequel on the most part. Though it didn't entirely succeed, the story is less fresh and less original, it is not as efficiently paced and the killer's reveal was predictable. However, the production values are of high quality, the music is still haunting and the sound still unsettling, there are still the funny lines, the genuine scares, the credible direction from Wes Craven and the return of the iconic GhostFace. The acting is still good too. So overall, a worthy sequel, just not quite the instant classic the first was. 7\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"15 July 2011","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The original Scream was a classic, so this sequel had a lot to live up to.

Scream is a wonderful film, a classic of its genre and a real scream from start to finish. The production values are excellent with atmospheric photography and settings, Wes Craven's direction is to date one of his best directing jobs, the music is haunting and the sound effects unsettling. The acting from Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox and David Arquette is top notch, and GhostFace as a character is iconic. What struck me as truly impressive about Scream was its originality, the story is fresh and while there are some funny lines, there are some genuinely scary, jump-out-of-your-seat moments too. Overall, brilliant. 10\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"15 July 2011","score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" What can I say?
