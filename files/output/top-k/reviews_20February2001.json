It's really nothing of the sort and the only recognizable similarity between the two is Hopkins' exceptional performance.  I read a lot of bashing of this movie so when I went in to see it today I was skeptical.  I thought to myself, is this movie going to be another one those cheap ripoff sequels that aren't even half of what the original was?  My skepticisms were thrown out the window however as this movie turned out to be a very suspensful and highly entertaining piece of film.To compare this movie to Silence is unjust for the fact that Hannibal tries not to be like it's predecessor.  It is very much unlike Silence, so u really cant compare the two.  When u go into see this movie, judge it alone without the comparison and I think u will see that this movie is very well done.  The acting is overall very superb.  Anthony Hopkins does no less than entrance the audience once again as the character of Hannibal seems to fit him like a glove.  Julianne Moore does a fairly good job playing Clarice Starling.  I have heard a lot of bad reviews about her role and I really cant see why.  She plays a different Starling then Foster did, since this movie is 10 years later, and pulls it off exceptionally.  The supporting cast also did a fine job especially Gary Oldman as Mason Verger, who plays a deliciously evil villain who sometimes deserves pity for what he is doing and what he went through.The plot in itself seemed to me to be fairly well written, and highly plausible, and to not give too much of the ending away, it does leave room for perhaps another sequel.  Speaking of the ending, I heard so much about the gruesome and gory scenes in this movie but when I walked out of the theatre I thought that they were not even half as bad as what most people were saying.  Perhaps it is the fact that I am maybe decensitized to violence, but this movie did not shock me, and I really dont think that is what it set out to do.  I think Ridley Scott set out make a film using his own brand\/style of directing, and if some scenes called for a bit of blood and guts, so be it.To conclude, if u enjoyed Silence of the Lambs and are looking for a deserving sequel to live up to the Hannibal name, perhaps this is not ur type of movie.  I rated it a 10 because of it's originality and brilliance, and I applaud the filmmakers for bringing the very believable character of Hannibal The Cannibal Lecter back into our lives, and nightmares.

What´s amazing is that things haven´t even changed in this 50 years, so i guess general audiences are condemned to watch Hollywood rip apart good books to fit the american audiences lack of knowledge of the rest of the world.And this stuff ended up giving a bit of emptiness to the movie in all the bits where there is no action or special effects, because those typical patriotic-anti-comunist-50´s style characters have realy nothing to say.

When I heard that Jodie Foster had dropped out of the production, I honestly thought that making this movie would be a terrible mistake.   When it was announced that the excellent Julianne Moore was going to step into the part, I thought that it could work but didnt really want it to happen.

Moore was not to blame for the disappointment of this movie though, overall she was OK, but I think 'Hannibal's' problems lie with the script, the writing and the producers wishes to create a popcorn franchise. Is it just me or did anybody else find Hopkin's Lecter far more menacing when he was incarcerated?.    Lecter's Transatlantic hoppings to me were unbelievable, OK the character is supposed to be of a high intelligence, but dont you think that he may realise that some sort of disguise may be needed to jump a commercial flight especially when you are on the FBI's 10 most wanted list.  Didnt the FBI think to look for him in Florence for 10 years considering he had a picture he had painted (from memory, no less!) of the city in his cell in Baltimore.I feel like Im nit-picking now, but if you are going to make a high budget sequel to one of the best thrillers of the last 20 years, at least give the viewers some credibility.On a final note and to highlight the last point, the last thirty minutes of this movie contain the most ludicrous, tongue-in-cheek scenes I have witnessed in a production of this calibre.

The back of the laserdisc that I purchased without seeing compared the movie as a cross between A Hard Day's Night and This Is Spinal Tap. You couldn't have a better comparison.I am not the biggest Spice girls fan, but writing this review in 2001 long after their 15 minutes of fame are over, I can be a little less closed-minded.Here is some questions that you in 2001 (and beyond) may ask of this movie1) Is this movie is funny?Yes it is, I agree that if you liked A Hard Day's Night you will enjoy Spice World also.

The Emperor's only worry in life was to make great films. He greenlighted many films and loved to show them off to his people. A few of these actually were great films, but many were not.Word of the Emperor's films spread over his kingdom and beyond. Some film producers from a foreign land who had heard of the Emperor's vanity decided to take advantage of it. They introduced themselves at the gates of the Emperor's studio with a scheme in mind.`We have invented an extraordinary method to turn an average kung fu flick into a box office smash,' they said. `It is called 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. As a matter of fact, its greatness cannot even be seen by anyone who is too stupid or unhip to appreciate it.'The Emperor gave the producers a large bag of gold in exchange for their promise to begin working on the film immediately. `Just tell us what you need to get started and we will give it to you,' he said, `marketing, distribution, you name it.'The producers then pretended to begin working on a quality film. The Emperor thought he had spent his money quite well in addition to getting an extraordinary new film, he would discover which of his subjects were stupid or unhip.Some time later, the Emperor called in his most trusted advisors, the President of Production, the President of Marketing and the President of Distribution. In those mythical days of yore, everyone working at an Emperor's studio, no matter at what level, was entitled to be called `President' of something. In fact, they even had a President of the Mail Room.. `Go and see how the work is proceeding,' the Emperor told them, `and come back and let me know.'The advisors were welcomed by the producers. `We're almost finished,' they said. `Here Excellencies, admire the script, see the acting.' The advisors looked at the film and tried to see the greatness that was not there. They felt a cold sweat break out on their foreheads. `I can't see anything,' they all thought at once. `If I see nothing, that means I'm stupid, or worse, unhip.'`What a marvelous film!' the advisors said. `We'll certainly tell the Emperor.' The producers rubbed their hands gleefully. They had almost made it. More gold was requested to finish the film.Finally, the Emperor received the announcement that the film was finished. `Here it is, Your Majesty,' the producers said. `We have worked night and day, but at last, the most beautiful film in the world is ready for you. Look at the acting and see how fine it is.' Of course the Emperor did not see any real acting at all, nor was there anything which could actually be called a story or a script. He panicked and felt like fainting. But when he realized that no one could know that he actually saw nothing, he felt better. `Yes, this truly is a great film,' the Emperor said, trying to look comfortable. `You've done a fine job.'`Your Majesty,' the advisors said, `we have a request for you. The people have found out about this extraordinary film and they are anxious to see it.' `All right,' the Emperor said, `I will grant the people this privilege.' He summoned his distributors and commanded that showings of the film be held all over the land. Film critics raved about it. Incredibly, the film was nominated for many awards, including the most prestigious award, a gold statuette presented annually by the Emperor Oscar. Finally, all the people gathered in the main square, known as IMDB User Comments, pushing and shoving to get a better look. An applause welcomed the regal presentation.As the Emperor's film passed the crowd in IMDB, a strange murmur rose from the crowd. Many said, loud enough for the others to hear, `Look at the Emperor's new film! It's a masterpiece! I have never seen anything like it in my life.' Some of the more outspoken subjects even went so far as to voice their opinion that this was the best film ever.They all tried to conceal their disappointment at not being able to see anything in film other than the silly mediocrity that it truly was, and since nobody was willing to admit that he was unhip or just didn't `get it', they all behaved as the producers had predicted.One viewer, however, just a regular viewer who could only see things as his eyes showed them to him, went to the film hoping to see greatness. He sat through it, just the same as anyone else (he even tried, though ultimately unsuccessfully, to restrain himself from commenting openly when one of the characters in the film said `When will this end?').And when the film was over, this viewer said simply, `The Emperor is naked. There's no great film here; it's just an average grade B kung fu flick.'`Fool,' the critics and others reprimanded, `Don't talk nonsense.' But the viewer's remark, which had been heard by the bystanders, was repeated over and over again until everyone cried `The viewer is right. The Emperor is naked. This is a mediocre film at best and is certainly not even remotely worthy of an Oscar nomination. What could they have been thinking!'The Emperor realized that the people were right but could not admit to that. He thought it better to continue the film under the illusion that anyone who couldn't see its greatness was either stupid or unhip.

With such masterpieces as The Ice Storm and Ride With the Devil, (bizarrely enough, shown for less than 3 weeks in UK cinemas) Ang Lee has proved himself to be one of the most versatile, intelligent people working in modern cinema today.I won't regurgitate on what countless numbers of people have already written here; but for me, there are very similar and interesting lines drawn here that overlap what 'American Beauty' and similar dramas are trying to tell us. It seems to me that CTHD is a daring story about the courage it takes to be yourself, in the same vein as other dramas of the year. (American Beauty, Boys Don't Cry) Intelligent, discerning people should come away from this movie and reflect on the hidden ideas that Ang Lee is trying to relate to us - what is our place in society? why do we conform to authority? etc.The other thing is, if you're a martial arts fanatic and are expecting a full-blown studio production along the lines of Jackie Chan \/ Jet Li, you will be very disappointed.

I get the impression that the writer must have almost written the part for her - it is as though she has some kind of inherent haughtiness in her. Her expression can be read in more than one way at some points in the film and there is a definite unpredictable element in her attitude to the circumstances. Moreover, this film shows humanity, as American Beauty did. It shows compassion and caring.People go to see films to be entertained, excited, and taken on a ride for a couple of hours. CTHD does this and so much more, this is moral therapy of the very highest order.

You won't be disappointed leaving the cinema, and I don't mind admitting that I was crying at the end - I definitely wasn't the only one either. One half of the audience sat there slack-jaw, the other half were openly crying and it reminds me of the society that was, before all this materialism has entered into our lives.

I must have seen Outland about fifteen times since i first saw it on the theathers when it came out, and after a while i want to go back to it, because i can remember the solid sci-fi atmosphere but i can´t visualize the whole movie clearly in my mind no more. Pretty weird feeling... This isn´t even a great movie, but it has this quality, that makes it almost impossible to turn away from it. For me i guess, it´s that realy believable atmosphere of a possible future, as i don´t believe much in that carpeted spaceship Star Trek look. I can bet that if we ever get to have some colonies in our solar system, they will look very similar (and as depressive), as the ones presented in Outland, wich is a sad fact unfortunely, but makes this movie stand out from all the tons of sci-fi movies.Everyone who sees it once, will remember it for a very long time, and this is because despite all the westen clichés set in space, this is a very original story, maybe not in its idea but in the way it´s presented to the audiences. And it´s a strange movie, because it´s very hard to classify. Despite being now an old movie, it has better visuals and special effects than many new releases and you can totaly forget that this movie is now about 20 years old. And there is not a single computer generated effect on sight. It must be one of those rare movies out there wich can only be classified as pure sci-fi and nothing else. It has action, but it always feels that never reaches for the full potential in what could have been done, so it can´t be classified as an action film also. It has a disturbing and creepy atmosphere sometimes, some gore scenes but it isn´t an horror movie. It has that classic cops plot made and re-made a million times from westerns to modern cop shows, but it´s not any of those kind of movies. What we have here is an ambiguous movie that´ends up being very dificult to classify, and perhaps that´s what makes it special and weird at the same time.Because contrary to Blade Runner for example, this movie doesn´t have a fan base, and i don´t think it can even be classified as a cult movie. Outland belongs to its own category and that´s what makes it special and never forgotten, despite nobody ever remembers anything clearly about it.It´s sci-fi. And a very good sci-fi story despite some minor flaws. Peter Hyams has style and i think he did a great job with this movie. I wish he would go back to this type of  personal movies and stop acting like a hired hand for Hollywood like it seems nowadays. With all the fast-food crappy so called sci-fi wich is around nowadays, Peter Hyams is the right man to still create a good science fiction movie. I wish he would made more movies like this and like 2010 wich is also excelent. So, if you like pure sci-fi and miss watching a good sci-fi movie, get this one because you won´t be disapointed. It´s an excelent strange movie. A real independent movie inside a major studio, if ever there was one.A brilliant movie, without actualy being great.

It has action, but it always feels that never reaches for the full potential in what could have been done, so it can´t be classified as an action film also. It has a disturbing and creepy atmosphere sometimes, some gore scenes but it isn´t an horror movie. It has that classic cops plot made and re-made a million times from westerns to modern cop shows, but it´s not any of those kind of movies. What we have here is an ambiguous movie that´ends up being very dificult to classify, and perhaps that´s what makes it special and weird at the same time.Because contrary to Blade Runner for example, this movie doesn´t have a fan base, and i don´t think it can even be classified as a cult movie. Outland belongs to its own category and that´s what makes it special and never forgotten, despite nobody ever remembers anything clearly about it.It´s sci-fi. And a very good sci-fi story despite some minor flaws. Peter Hyams has style and i think he did a great job with this movie. I wish he would go back to this type of  personal movies and stop acting like a hired hand for Hollywood like it seems nowadays. With all the fast-food crappy so called sci-fi wich is around nowadays, Peter Hyams is the right man to still create a good science fiction movie. I wish he would made more movies like this and like 2010 wich is also excelent. So, if you like pure sci-fi and miss watching a good sci-fi movie, get this one because you won´t be disapointed. It´s an excelent strange movie. A real independent movie inside a major studio, if ever there was one.A brilliant movie, without actualy being great. I know this sounds weird, but Outland is exactely like this. Don´t miss it.

However, remembering how a similar prejudice against Jim Carrey was proved flawed, I thought I really should give the feller a chance. I fear I shall never know if I was lucky or unlucky in chancing upon this film as my first exposure to Sandler (except for Airheads, which came before his elevation to star status and in which I recall him giving a perfectly acceptable performance in a minor role); perhaps this is his greatest work and I have saved myself from far worse, perhaps this is some terrible travesty hacked to death by blinkered execs and stripped of all its comic genius. I hope I never find out, as having seen this I have renewed my vow to steer well clear of Sandler for the rest of time. Possibly his writers and director should shoulder some of the blame, as most of the film seems to have been made up on the fly, with near-constant changes of direction as if they were bored with the way the story was going and started afresh without bothering to change the previous sections. Some scenes seem quite superfluous while others are clearly rushed, paking in as much story and character development as possible without simply holding up a card saying 'this guy just did something bad and will now pay for it'. Most of the film however consists of Sandler 'performing', creating a truly repugnant character with no redeeming qualities even after smearing himself with a thick layer of schmaltz in the epiphany required of this genre (the 'really awful comedy' style). He has little or no acting ability (he plays drunk by tilting his head forward slightly while slurring his words in an even more unfeasible and irritating style than his normal delivery), none of Carrey's physical comedy skills, no charisma, charm or interest. Only the awesome Steve Buscemi's association with the project, and few brief appearances, prevent this from becoming my first ever 1\/10 film. Someone please put a stop to this awful man.

However, I could save you the pain of having to go see this poor excuse for a plot.Before I go into tearing this movie apart, I will say that the acting was good.  Charlize Theron was convincing in her part and Keanu Reeves was not bad.  But let's face it, the best actors in the world could not save this demented plot.  The ending leaves you wondering, did she die? But in reality, no one really cares because the plot died 45 minutes before the ending.Let's start at the beginning.  Here we have Keanu Reeves who is a successful advertiser.  He meets a very attractive woman who is nuts and, basically, stalks him.  He loses his job and his girlfriend and then with very little prompting (maybe a little bit of tantrum throwing), he is spending the night with her and in bed.  Now, I'm all for movies that are fairytales, but the reality is that the normal person would not have slept with this woman, because he would be violating his own restraining order, that he would have obtained the day prior.Okay, let's get past this.  Let's say that for some unknown, however stupid reason, he does stay with this nut.  Now the plot tries to lead you into believing that she is just a selfless person. She is a woman trying to help a man who is lost in the perversion of an every day boring life. She convinces him to stay with her and have sex, and look at the pretty sky and the world around them and then have more sex.  Now this is supposed to help him, How?But wait!!! It gets better!!!  We find out that she is such a selfless person that she not only is doing this for Keanu, she has done this on a monthly basis for numerous men.  Keanu is just the month of November.  Now, this should make him feel just great, to know that this caring woman names her men by the month and then just dumps them.  Oh, I can just feel the love!  By doing this, all of these men must have walked away saying, Gee, I'm so glad she deceived me and made me a better person for it.  Now, I will go lead a life with no job, smell flowers, pet dogs, look at the sky and thank that wonderful woman for jumping off the high rope and crushing my heart.What this movie really shows, was a woman who used men in a selfish way, to better her own loneliness, without committing to them.  she knew that their time was finished when the month was gone.  Time, to move onto the next sucker, until I die.  It showed someone who was out only for herself, not for any sacrifice for someone else, but solely and only for her.I kept waiting for this movie to redeem itself.  I watched it to the ending credits.  I have never watched a movie that was supposed to be about a woman (or man) dying and left with not a single feeling of sorrow for that person, until now.  The only one I felt sorry for, was the character that Keanu played, because he was such a dupe.  When he pulled that scarf down, I was happy to see that she was gone.  Now, maybe he would still have time to go get that restraining order.
