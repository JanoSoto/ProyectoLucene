The cast is worth your $7 to $10 bucks alone. I really admire Steve Miner's films. There is something about them that has great time guaranteed written all over them.

I mean they didn't do it alone but they were the stars. Dylan McDermott, Randy Travis, Tom Skeritt, Vincent Spano, and Alfred Molina were there too. Kinda like the old generation meets the new.I was extremely disappointed with the story though. Sure there are explosions and gun fire throughout but when it comes down to the point it was kinda weak. Let's put it this way, it didn't have anything spectacular that you could say was original. Like almost every other movie playing right now (Spy Game, Behind Enemy Lines, or even the recent American Outlaws), its not original. Sometimes I think these screenwriters pull out an old script and modernize it with a cool name and tagline. Maybe thats not a thought and the truth. I'd like to see a western like Tombstone again. I'd even like to see a new action movie without all the camera moving and jumping through the air 'Matrix' style. But that will probably not happen till I get myself out to Hollywood.Enough dreaming. The reality is its a cool hip western. A fun one that I wouldn't mind watching again someday. The cast was excellent and yes, the acting was fair. A whole lot better than American Outlaws and the violence was okay despite the PG-13 rating. Do some more reading on this movie before seeing it though, I mean I am the one who said Megiddo was a good Christian film.

It's very weird when a movie comes out claiming to be a sequel and none of the characters act the same.  The Bandit was just an all-out jerk in that one and it's a wonder the writers ever got a paycheck.  I would have sued. Bandit 3 should have been an apology for the second and while it wasn't exactly that, it sure was a lot of fun.  It's certainly got it's share of faults.  The whole thing feels very slap dash, kinda like Director Dick Lowry was in a hell of a hurry to get it made and released as quickly as the characters were trying to transport the plastic shark.

As many people know, Jackie Gleason was supposed to be playing both, Smokey and the Bandit (what the hell?) and the original cut of this film, was shot just that way (what the HELL were they thinking?!) as Smokey IS the Bandit.  I don't know who was to blame for that enormously stupid idea, but I thank God that the test audiences felt the same way as I do about it.  When everyone failed to see the humor in that, the director went back to work.

Knowing all of this, I still enjoy watching it.  I'm not sure why, but it's just good light-hearted fun.

They moan and groan about bad acting, bad special effects, bad directing, blah blah blah. Can you even comprehend the difficulty of what they set out to do in making this film? Bad acting? Radcliffe does an outstanding job of playing Harry Potter exactly as he is in the books. Very laid back, unassuming, quiet. The comments about John William's score just crack me up. Where the heck have you been the last 30 years. The guy is brilliant - the music was perfect for this movie, one of the highlights. The music in SWPM was one of the things that held the movie above water. It is common for people to gain attention by disliking something that is popular. Heck, we have a whole generation of people who don't know what they like because they are too concerned with what they don't like. I've read the books in the series twice. Yes, some things were left out. It's a movie - that's what always happens. Did you want an 8 hour movie? Heck, The Stand was over 6 hours and only contained about 25% of what was in the book. My expectations when going into the theater were  It's not going to be exactly like the book; It's a kids movie, so expect a kids movie; Hope the child actors can pull off their roles and give me a visual representation of the wizard world and the characters that is similar to what I have in my mind This movie surpassed my expectations.

Rather, it is one for all who lived during the 1940s north of the Mason-Dixon Line in any of the small towns from the East Coast to the Mid-West where there is an old-fashioned town square with one department store where everyone goes and an old-fashioned `Santa' parade where the whole town comes out to end up standing in a long line for their children to sit on Santa's lap.You would not know that this film was set during the time of World War II.  Except, if you looked really close you would see that the tires on Mr. Parker's car are bald.  There is no mention of wartime rationing or the lack of items to purchase because the country is at war during this time frame.  I guess this 1983 film suggests that people were not `thinking' about the war.The film is a telling of the pleasant memories of 9-year old, 4th grader, Ralphie Parker (played by 12 year old Peter Billingsley) who only wants a `Red Ryder' Carbine Action Two-Hundred Shot Lightning Loader Range Model B-B Air Rifle for Christmas.  Ralphie shares his bedroom with his 1st grade little brother, Randy (played by Ian Patrella).  Somehow, Raphie must get the message to his parents that this is the one present he is dreaming of for Christmas.Mr. Parker known only as `The Old Man' is played by then, 61-year-old Darren McGavin (AKA Carl Kolchak The Night Stalker (1974-1975) TV Series) Today, Mr. McGavin is 79 years old.  However he was playing the role of a father, maybe in his early 40s?  Mr. McGavin is a very talented and funny actor.  Can you imagine growing up with a father who is this nutsy all year long, let alone during Christmas Time?Mr. Parker is married to Mrs. Parker played by Melinda Dillon whom today is 62 years of age.  Ms. Dillon (AKA Close Encounters of the Third Kind - 1977) was at the making of this film 44 years old.  And, yet, Hollywood was able to pull it off pairing her with a movie husband who was 17 years her senior!  What goes on during this movie is hilarious.  We have an audience of 1,000 people in a classic films revival laughing out loud to scenes so good that they don't need a TV sitcom laugh track for people to know when it's funny.  There is the classic method of the actual author, Jean Shepherd, speaking as an adult, unseen, talking over the film, telling the tale of himself as a young boy, as he remembers it.  This technique would be copied later during the successful TV series, The Wonder Years.We have events in the life of Ralphie that we can all relate to.  Being bundled up like a mummy to go out into the snow to walk to school.  We have an elementary school built in the 1920s of red brick with old-fashioned school desks and cursive writing samples along the chalkboard.  We have that schoolmarm teacher who towers over young 4th graders and likes to make the kiddies write theme papers.  We have that kid who takes the triple dog dare and gets his tongue stuck on the cold metal school flagpole.  We have those older school bullies whom wait before and after school to scare and intimidate the younger students for their own amusement until one boy can't take it any more and fights the older boy.  We have the boy who wears glasses and finds ways to break them.  We have children who dream up excuses to try to explain away their misdeeds to their teacher and parents.  We have the children whom (there is no TV during this era) lie on the floor and stare at the console radio and listen to the weekly radio program while waiting for the secret Orphan Annie decoder device to arrive in the mail only to be disappointed by the weekly secret message.  We have authentic furniture of the era and old two story granny houses with wrap around wooden porches &#150; no modern ranch style homes in this town.  We have the trip to the Christmas tree lot and selecting a tree that we take home tied to the roof of a 1930's car.  We have standing in line for hours waiting to sit on the lap of the one department store Santa and the disaster that ensues during that encounter.  And, where does your family have Christmas dinner when the turkey is ruined?  In short, we have all the nostalgia of a young boy, your parents or grandparents, whom were born during the Great Depression and grew up during a great World War.  And these are just a few of the memories you may remember if you were a child during the 1940s.   Christmas time is only the vehicle used to tell this story.  Imagine being a young boy growing up all year long in such a household as the Parkers?  There must have been wall-to-wall laughs all day, every day!Does Ralphie ever get his much-wanted air rifle for Christmas?I saw this movie in a classical renaissance 1,500-seat movie theater on a huge screen.

Rather, it is one for all who lived during the 1940s north of the Mason-Dixon Line in any of the small towns from the East Coast to the Mid-West where there is an old-fashioned town square with one department store where everyone goes and an old-fashioned `Santa' parade where the whole town comes out to end up standing in a long line for their children to sit on Santa's lap.You would not know that this film was set during the time of World War II.  Except, if you looked really close you would see that the tires on Mr. Parker's car are bald.  There is no mention of wartime rationing or the lack of items to purchase because the country is at war during this time frame.  I guess this 1983 film suggests that people were not `thinking' about the war.The film is a telling of the pleasant memories of 9-year old, 4th grader, Ralphie Parker (played by 12 year old Peter Billingsley) who only wants a `Red Ryder' Carbine Action Two-Hundred Shot Lightning Loader Range Model B-B Air Rifle for Christmas.  Ralphie shares his bedroom with his 1st grade little brother, Randy (played by Ian Patrella).  Somehow, Raphie must get the message to his parents that this is the one present he is dreaming of for Christmas.Mr. Parker known only as `The Old Man' is played by then, 61-year-old Darren McGavin (AKA Carl Kolchak The Night Stalker (1974-1975) TV Series) Today, Mr. McGavin is 79 years old.  However he was playing the role of a father, maybe in his early 40s?  Mr. McGavin is a very talented and funny actor.  Can you imagine growing up with a father who is this nutsy all year long, let alone during Christmas Time?Mr. Parker is married to Mrs. Parker played by Melinda Dillon whom today is 62 years of age.  Ms. Dillon (AKA Close Encounters of the Third Kind - 1977) was at the making of this film 44 years old.  And, yet, Hollywood was able to pull it off pairing her with a movie husband who was 17 years her senior!  What goes on during this movie is hilarious.  We have an audience of 1,000 people in a classic films revival laughing out loud to scenes so good that they don't need a TV sitcom laugh track for people to know when it's funny.  There is the classic method of the actual author, Jean Shepherd, speaking as an adult, unseen, talking over the film, telling the tale of himself as a young boy, as he remembers it.  This technique would be copied later during the successful TV series, The Wonder Years.We have events in the life of Ralphie that we can all relate to.  Being bundled up like a mummy to go out into the snow to walk to school.  We have an elementary school built in the 1920s of red brick with old-fashioned school desks and cursive writing samples along the chalkboard.  We have that schoolmarm teacher who towers over young 4th graders and likes to make the kiddies write theme papers.  We have that kid who takes the triple dog dare and gets his tongue stuck on the cold metal school flagpole.  We have those older school bullies whom wait before and after school to scare and intimidate the younger students for their own amusement until one boy can't take it any more and fights the older boy.  We have the boy who wears glasses and finds ways to break them.  We have children who dream up excuses to try to explain away their misdeeds to their teacher and parents.  We have the children whom (there is no TV during this era) lie on the floor and stare at the console radio and listen to the weekly radio program while waiting for the secret Orphan Annie decoder device to arrive in the mail only to be disappointed by the weekly secret message.

Well after watching it first in English, then in German (with subtitles), and then again with the commentary track on (DVD) all on the same evening I knew that I had to add this movie to my collection.Run Lola Run is now in my top 10 of all time along with 2001, The Wizard of Oz, Fargo, Blade Runner, American Beauty, The Matrix, The Shawshank Redemption, Moulin Rouge, and Silence of the Lambs. Out of these, Run Lola Run has been played more times than all of the others, even though I've owned it for less than a month.A movie is really nothing more than images, sounds and a story, but it seems that every aspect of this film has been so well thought out and executed that I can't imagine anything that could be done to improve it. The camera movement and soundtrack suit the action perfectly. The way that the score fits in with the editing points is superb.The DVD version is excellent in picture and sound quality....Sony Pictures Classics knew that they had a gem in this movie and gave it a beautiful translation to DVD. If only the English dub was a bit better...there's so much happening on-screen that it is distracting to read the subtitles. I've actually learned quite a few German words by listening to the German audio track with subtitles!The performances are great - The final scene in the movie is excellent - notice Lola's subtle facial expressions as Manni walks towards her.... what is she thinking? Maybe a sequel will tell us.Run Lola Run is a rare movie that combines action, suspense, black comedy, music and is also thought-provoking....(What if I had done this differently?)
