[{"date":"24 February 2002","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Elizabeth is a perversely dark film that is impossible to ignore -- or forget.  The film, clearly the best picture of 1998, is a unique epic of its kind.  It's not overlong, nor is it presumptuous.  The film has a wonderfully dark atmosphere that is rarely seen in this kind of picture.  Although the film is dark, you never get the idea that it is trying too hard -- like a Tim Burton film would.Cate Blanchett is unforgettable as Elizabeth, but the real treat of the film is the marvelous Geoffrey Rush -- as her evil man servant who will do anything to protect her.A truly great film -- one of my all time favorites.
