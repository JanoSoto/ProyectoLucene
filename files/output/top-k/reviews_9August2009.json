I was a teenager when it first came out and it remains the quintessential 80's Teen movie. John Hughes made great and entertaining films and it is sad that he is no longer with us, by far his best work are the teen flicks of the 80s.Reading through the comments on here, I was initially really upset that some people hated it (how dare they!), but I have thought of a few reasons why.Firstly, there will always be people who just don't like this sort of film. It's just a given.Secondly there are people who are uneasy about the characters and how rigidly stereotyped they are. I understand this, but I also think I get why John Hughes made them this way. Obviously 'real' people are less defined and have a bit more of this or that in them, but my experience of school was that kids pigeon-hole people like crazy. If someone is big on sports that defines them, if someone is highly academic with no interest in sport they are 'a geek'. They are other things too, but this main characteristic is the 'essence' of who they are in high school terms. Brian says '....the most convenient definitions....' I think John Hughes simplified them to exaggerate this point.Finally, and this is the sad reason. I think The Breakfast Club is victim of its own success. These films (The Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, Some Kind of Wonderful, etc) paved the way for the teen movie format. They have been emulated, rewoven, and even copied. There have been so many teen flicks in the 25 years since The Breakfast Club was made, that I worry that it's near impossible for the modern teen to fully appreciate the films as I did when I was young. The Breakfast Club could seem clichéd even though it wasn't originally. It is a little slow by modern standards and the dialogue is occasionally dated. I wonder whether it would have been made if the script came along now; and that, my friends, would have been a great shame, because it really is a great movie and I don't believe the underlying messages are any less relevant now than they were then (eg prejudice, pigeon holing, petty authority, home life, wealth\/poverty, understanding) So, please do watch this film, forgive some of the dated vernacular and try to judge it sympathetically as an original format for its time.

However, those who perk up at the idea of following a narcissistic, pathetic, bad poetry-spouting, sociopathic mass murderer around for 90 minutes will find this clever, disturbing, and unique alt-classic well deserving of the Criterion Collection treatment it has received.There isn't much plot to be had here, only a document of heinous deeds performed by a nonplussed killer who cares about motive about as much as he cares about human life. We are allowed here to tag along with him as he engages in a series of brutal killings for no apparent reason other than the opportunity to steal money from his random victims, and to scratch our heads in befuddled wonder as he pauses between murders to introduce us to his parents, orate poems about the leaves in springtime, and expound on a variety of pressing issues such as the mating rituals of pigeons and the proper ratios for weighing down corpses before dumping them into the water (old people's bones are porous, therefore five times their body weight is optimal... good to know?).Benoit Poolverde offers us a character without a single positive attribute, yet somehow provides enough incredulous spunk to make even his most mundane actions absolutely riveting. It is a magnificent performance, and it would be ridiculous not to commend Poolverde for plunging himself so fully into the mind of a character so impossible to like. Further complicating Benoit's role is the absence of any sort of understanding about the monstrous life that this lonely and miserable human being inhabits. He'd much rather talk about obscure French films than psychological triggers, but with the zest and childlike buoyancy he thrusts into his extroversion of the most mundane topics one could imagine a serial killer pondering, we still want to hear the guy out.I'm realizing that none of this is making this film sound appealing. The truth is, it's probably not. But it surely is engrossing, and for those who were able to find the pitch black humor in the grim world of Trainspotting, the tone here will tickle the most psychotic funny bone in your body.I'm also realizing that I've mentioned Trainspotting twice, which may seem a bit odd since that film is about heroin addicts, while this one is about sadistic execution. Perhaps it is effective here to break a unique film like Man Bites Dog down to it's component parts. The bond with Trainspotting is the ability of both films to conjure comedy amidst such bleak and soul-darkening backdrops. The comparison to A Clockwork Orange at the head of this write-up is for the unabashedly devastating violence on display here. There are also shades of American Psycho, if only for the callous and remorseless mindset of our central character. We also have to mention Henry Portrait Of A Serial Killer, which is referenced heavily in a scene where Benoit and his dehumanized camera crew break into a couple's apartment and take turns raping the wife before performing dissections on her so thorough, they'd make Jack The Ripper blush. We can also compare this film to The Blair Witch Project because of the way the tiny budget complements the piece, as the grainy black and white stock used to capture this catalog of carnage perfectly visualizes the stark documentary realism we're being presented.But, all comparisons aside, Man Bites Dog remains unlike anything you've ever seen. Simultaneously revolting and witty, the film sets a tone that no other bit of cinema has ever dared. This is perhaps most suitably displayed in a scene where Benoit teaches us how to make a mixed drink called Dead Baby Boy, a libation which actually duplicates what would happen to the body of the titular victim after being dumped. In fact, your enjoyment of this film will likely depend solely on your reaction to the scene synopsis I've just offered.This is an unpleasant film to watch, and it seems to be reaching for no significant message or theme, but Man Bites Dog is an exhilarating road to nowhere, and even Benoit's eventual comeuppance at the conclusion doesn't dilute the unsettling feeling this movie conjures. Fans of the bizarre can consider themselves incomplete until they've added this gem to their list. Also highly recommended for pigeon enthusiasts, by the way.

We are allowed here to tag along with him as he engages in a series of brutal killings for no apparent reason other than the opportunity to steal money from his random victims, and to scratch our heads in befuddled wonder as he pauses between murders to introduce us to his parents, orate poems about the leaves in springtime, and expound on a variety of pressing issues such as the mating rituals of pigeons and the proper ratios for weighing down corpses before dumping them into the water (old people's bones are porous, therefore five times their body weight is optimal... good to know?).Benoit Poolverde offers us a character without a single positive attribute, yet somehow provides enough incredulous spunk to make even his most mundane actions absolutely riveting. It is a magnificent performance, and it would be ridiculous not to commend Poolverde for plunging himself so fully into the mind of a character so impossible to like. Further complicating Benoit's role is the absence of any sort of understanding about the monstrous life that this lonely and miserable human being inhabits. He'd much rather talk about obscure French films than psychological triggers, but with the zest and childlike buoyancy he thrusts into his extroversion of the most mundane topics one could imagine a serial killer pondering, we still want to hear the guy out.I'm realizing that none of this is making this film sound appealing. The truth is, it's probably not. But it surely is engrossing, and for those who were able to find the pitch black humor in the grim world of Trainspotting, the tone here will tickle the most psychotic funny bone in your body.I'm also realizing that I've mentioned Trainspotting twice, which may seem a bit odd since that film is about heroin addicts, while this one is about sadistic execution. Perhaps it is effective here to break a unique film like Man Bites Dog down to it's component parts. The bond with Trainspotting is the ability of both films to conjure comedy amidst such bleak and soul-darkening backdrops. The comparison to A Clockwork Orange at the head of this write-up is for the unabashedly devastating violence on display here. There are also shades of American Psycho, if only for the callous and remorseless mindset of our central character. We also have to mention Henry Portrait Of A Serial Killer, which is referenced heavily in a scene where Benoit and his dehumanized camera crew break into a couple's apartment and take turns raping the wife before performing dissections on her so thorough, they'd make Jack The Ripper blush. We can also compare this film to The Blair Witch Project because of the way the tiny budget complements the piece, as the grainy black and white stock used to capture this catalog of carnage perfectly visualizes the stark documentary realism we're being presented.But, all comparisons aside, Man Bites Dog remains unlike anything you've ever seen. Simultaneously revolting and witty, the film sets a tone that no other bit of cinema has ever dared. This is perhaps most suitably displayed in a scene where Benoit teaches us how to make a mixed drink called Dead Baby Boy, a libation which actually duplicates what would happen to the body of the titular victim after being dumped. In fact, your enjoyment of this film will likely depend solely on your reaction to the scene synopsis I've just offered.This is an unpleasant film to watch, and it seems to be reaching for no significant message or theme, but Man Bites Dog is an exhilarating road to nowhere, and even Benoit's eventual comeuppance at the conclusion doesn't dilute the unsettling feeling this movie conjures. Fans of the bizarre can consider themselves incomplete until they've added this gem to their list. Also highly recommended for pigeon enthusiasts, by the way.

From Count Olaf to The Riddler, Carrey actually gives his best performance as the Grinch. Jim Carrey is my favorite actor. I will see any film he's in, so it's no wonder I saw How the Grinch Stole Christmas. It tanked at with critics, but I must disagree. I couldn't believe how much I loved this film, it's an awesome film. Jim Carrey is fantastic as The Grinch, and I couldn't believe how much I loved this film. Like How much I couldn't believe I loved A series of Unfortunate events. Carrey is evil in that film but I still liked his character. Sort of like with Ralph Feinnes in Harry Potter. His character is a bastard but I think he is pretty cool. It sounds like i'm supporting evil, but trust me, i'm not supporting evil. Somehow, everybody hated The Grinch.

Having gained a significant cult following over the years, Christopher Nolan's breakthrough feature beautifully exhibits his incredible talent as a storyteller & remains one of the finest features of his illustrious film career.Divided into 2 not-so-distant timelines which periodically alternate throughout its runtime, Memento tells the story of Leonard Shelby; an ex-insurance detective who is suffering from short-term memory loss that leaves him incapable of remembering new memories and makes use of notes & tattoos as reminders. The plot covers his desperate attempt to find the person he thinks is responsible for the murder of his wife, which is the last thing he's able recall.Written & directed by Christopher Nolan, the best part about Memento is its carefully structured style of narration which puts the viewers in the protagonist's shoes as the reverse chronological order makes sure that just like Leonard, we have no knowledge of what happened before. And as the story progresses & we start connecting the dots, everything starts making sense to eventually deliver a cerebral experience that's as enriching as it is exhilarating.Cinematography makes the 2 segments easy to differentiate by capturing one in crisp black n white while the other stays in colour. Editing is its finest filmmaking aspect, David Julyan's score adds an elegant touch to its plot & the performances by its cast is no slouch. Guy Pearce really surprises with a properly weighed performance as Leonard Shelby while Carrie-Anne Moss & Joe Pantoliano deliver equally mysterious & complex performances in their supporting roles.Captivating, innovative, complex, exciting & entertaining from start to finish, Memento is a brilliantly directed, smartly scripted, finely photographed, ingeniously edited & wonderfully performed psychological thriller that will leave its own memento on your mind & you're gonna have a hard time forgetting how much you enjoyed solving this expertly crafted puzzle on your own.

I thought it was great when I first watched in back in the eighties and having just watching it again think it has lost none of its charm. While some of the technology seen in the film is old the film itself doesn't seem dated at all.Ferris Bueller is a seventeen year old high school student who has decided to feign illness so that he can take the day off and enjoy himself in the city. He is joined on his escapade by his friend Cameron who is off school because he really is sick and his girlfriend Sloane who gets let out of school when Cameron phones in, claiming to be her father, saying her grandmother has died. They head off to the city in Cameron's father's pride and joy; a 1961 Ferrari 250GT California. Once there they see the sights narrowly avoiding being caught a few times along the way; they probably learn much more than they would have had they stayed in school.While Ferris and his friends are out enjoying their day school principal Ed Rooney is sure that Ferris is faking his illness and he is determined to prove it. The only other person who believes Ferris is faking it is his sister Jeanie who is fed up with how he always seems to get away with everything.This is one of the great eighties teen movies created by the master of the genre, the film is full of memorably scenes that contain lots of classic lines.

He captured teen angst in a way that set him apart from any of his exploitation-driven colleagues. However, for my money, his best and funniest work is actually a road movie, 1987's Planes, Trains and Automobiles. Film critic Roger Ebert goes as far as including it as one of his top favorites in his 2005 compendium, The Great Movies II. For me, I continue to be surprised at how much I laugh when I see this movie.I thought that by now, surely the comic sight gags and the casting of Steve Martin and the late John Candy would automatically make this a candidate for an eighties time capsule. Instead, I have to agree with Ebert and say this film has only grown over time.

What it comes down to is a classic anti-buddy picture as two mismatched individuals are thrown together and of course, suffer one bizarre misadventure after another as they try to make it home to Chicago for Thanksgiving.Although one would think it would have more in common with Neil Simon's The Odd Couple, the plot actually reminds me much more of Simon's The Out-of-Towners, and anyone familiar with that film will have a good idea of what will happen to them.

The Godfather plot gets more into the political aspects rather than on mafia wars or vendettas and that brings in consequence more dramatic situations inside the family. Thus the film has a darker, more tense tone.It focuses more on the personal consequences provoked by the family's criminal empire in the US and in Cuba. Michael's character is explored and taken to a new darker level. We understand that his personal life is falling to pieces as his wife provoked an abortion and plans to leave him, while, at the same time, he faces a betrayal from his older brother and the burdens of his sister's life. Michael, unlike Vito, is more cold hearted but marvelous when playing his cards. Vito made sure to establish his criminal empire before others could consider him as an enemy and with his guts, he decides to take down the mafia leader in the zone, Don Fanucci. Later, Vito starts a huge oil business and executes a long time vendetta. That was Vito Corleone, a brilliant negotiator, persuasion leader, calmed down, and smart Italian-American who started from zero and thanks to his family's support, loyal associates, and leadership; soon started his own empire.When both character's reach a similar climatic situation; it's up to Michael to learn through his mother how his father would act in order to keep his family safe or how to deal with a certain problem. After plenty of intermissions that show us Vito's start in mafia; we construct in our mind a parallel story that will give us the weapons to know how Michael is gonna act.Vito, in his younger years, demonstrated to be very protective of his family and members of his other family. He didn't have to face betrayal or similar situations when he started to build the empire; unlike Michael who is in a very complex situation that not only deals with politics.The trial that the Corleones face is absolutely brilliant on the political side because Michael moves his cards in such a class act manner that witnesses who have the chance to take the business down suddenly regret on their accusations. Michael is now a brilliant politician who has controls the strings of senators, judges, mafia bosses, etc. His the most powerful criminal in the country.This makes Michael a true menacing leader with such power that he is feared, respected by everyone, including his close family.So the movie focuses primarly on Michael and Hyman Roth, making Vito in his young years a supporting character along with Clemenza and Tessio. The supporting characters from the actual events include favorites such as Al Neri (although he was in part 1), Rocco, Fredo once again, Willi Cicci, Frank, Connie, and Mother Corleone. Tom Hagen deserves a special spot for being the equilibrium of the family on the most difficult situations. He's just a splendid sidekick and opposite at the same time for Michael.Special mention for Michael's extremely creepy and lethal capo-bodyguard who provided some of the most suspenseful scenes in cinema history just by making presence. He must be a role model for the Giallo sub-genre.The atmosphere in the movie is absolutely amazing, beautiful. The funeral scene is sad and intense, while the Cuban new year's eve party is glamorous, colorful, and nerve tensing. I enjoyed big time the carnival in Vito's younger years.The movie is excellent, just excellent. It's a mix of classic score executed by orchestras, mixed with creepy piano elements, and classical\/popular Italian melodies.The acting is just wonderful. Al Pacino delivers the acting display of his career. Michael Corleone is a brilliant man, with an admirable temper, excellent knowledge of politics and human behavior. Al Pacino demonstrates he can act in EVERY single possible situation. Robert De Niro's performance is highly regarded because of his masterful display of Marlon Brando's behavior translated translated through the Vito Corleone character. The movie focuses on both actor's characters and that's why you just explore them at full. The acting by Robert Duvall is a glory. The rest of the cast is just wonderful and deserve to be congratulated but let's face it; this is all about Pacino and DeNiro.To be honest, myself as a die-hard Horror cinema expert, I can say this sequel is amongst the most tense, suspenseful and stressing but pleasant viewing experiences I've ever experienced.There's plenty of tension, high-quality action sequences (my favorites include Michael's murder attempt which is later spectacular when his gunmen search for the assassin's; Frank's murder attempt when Cicci gets injured; the Cuban citizens rebellion, and the climax when Frank commits suicide, Roth gets killed, Fredo pays for his betrayal, etc.).I loved the final sequence when the flashback takes place and Michael is left alone, drinking tea or wine I can't remember... he just thinks and plans his future in that moment. It's a brilliant scene.Please watch this movie because it's a lesson of life through tense situations that happen in real life, for some.Ford Coppola's delicate, classy direction makes this a great visual experience in all the sense of the word; he creates a whole new world in which we are invited without having to be worried. Now, when a movie is part of your life you can say it's more than a great experience.

'The Golden Bowl' does not reach the level of the aforementioned two films but it still was a good watch. Ivory does successfully manage to create a feel of that time period. The sets and costumes look quite authentic. Through subtle references one can see how James Ivory has been influenced by classic movies. The story is about complex relationships, between a father and his daughter, between two former lovers and between husbands and wives. The characters are very well etched and layered and it is the mystery of these characters that has intrigued me the most. How long has Verver known about Amerigo and Charlotte's relationship? Since when has Maggie known? Did Charlotte have any feelings at all for Verver? The film does move at a slightly tedious pace but it picks up when Maggie starts suspecting the relationship between Charlotte and Amerigo. Northam's Amerigo takes some getting used to. I found him funny initially but once one is passed that he's quite good and terrific in the scenes where he's restrained. Uma Thurman sizzles. Charlotte may come across as a temptress at times but Thurman portrays her vulnerability and despair with gusto. Kate Beckinsale is equally fantastic. Hats off to Nick Nolte for a studied and subtle performance of a father who has to make the ultimate sacrifice in order to save his daughter's marriage. Angelica Huston makes herself noticeable. 'The Golden Bowl' may not be the best of Ivory Merchant but it's still an interesting period drama a fascinating study of characters.
