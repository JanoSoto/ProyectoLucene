[{"date":"12 March 2013","score":"","review":" Somewhere after the halfway mark of this movie, I noticed that the tone had changed. It had gone down into a Spielberg style. I had missed the credits and didn't realize that it was under his direction. After 20 minutes or so, the initial style of the movie resumed, the Spielberg negatives disappeared, and the suspense and strong execution resumed. That middle segment is why I do not rate this movie more highly than 7.For some reason, Spielberg laid aside his usual faults for most of the movie. What are these faults that crept in during the middle? First, casting and\/or directing supporting actors who have no charisma. In fact, they are usually directed to act queerly in their voice intonations and deliveries. They reduce the film to a kind of comic book Superman status at that point. Second, the John Williams score cooperates with this juvenile approach at that point. Third, the actors even are made to look like oddballs, beside behaving like oddballs. Spielberg doesn't know how to handle grotesques without making them seem very strange. Fourth, introducing wacko action that's unrealistic. This includes Cruise chasing his eyeballs down a corridor and rescuing them from a grate. That's typical Spielberg. It also includes impossible acrobatics in a robotized car chase. Fifth, excessive exposition that runs too long and repeats itself. The explanation of the Minority Report is an example. A borderline case occurs when Cruise gets entangled in a robotic assembly line that is making automobiles. It has the feel of a Star Wars movie. Sixth, Cruise's capacity to fight off multiple cops is not believable. Better to leave out the juvenile action components which are by now hackneyed anyway.If Spielberg could have avoided these faults and maintained a consistent noir tone throughout, the movie would have been a much more coherent and effective work of art. He almost but not quite spoiled it.The movie is strong when the major actors, Cruise and von Sydow are on screen, which fortunately is most of the time. Also, the two female leads are very believable. That's Cruise's wife and Samantha Morton, who plays a female capable of pre-cognition of murder images. She is very convincing.The story is reasonably strong, although not without some inexplicable plot jumps, such as the recovery and release of Cruise from his treatment with a head-loop device. It is also not altogether clear why von Sydow behaves as he does. The ending in which the actions of the antagonist are revealed during a reception honoring him has been done before.The script takes developments that are happening now and projects them into the future 40 years. At this it excels. The iris-recognition technology combined with the use of spider-like drones to recognize people is an example. I wish the originality had been allowed to suffuse the whole story and the focus had been more on psychology and use of everyday elements suspensefully than on concocted action and queer characters at times.
