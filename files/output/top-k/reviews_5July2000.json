So I went after reading great and awful things about it. Well I would say it's nice to see a good, light, nice, cute film where the f word is not in each and every scene(Hope you'll read this, Mr Singleton with all due respect), where there aren't 2500 gun shots per second and where real human feelings are actually present all along. I think anyone who's been in such a relationship can totally relate to this film. Some people will reproach Jason Biggs role that feels too close from American pie and yes that's the movie main flaw but no movie is perfect and this one has not been produced for next year's academy award race. Also what really did surprise me was the great chemistry between Forlani and Prinze Jr. that you can definitely feel. I don't want to spoil it for anyone but the ending(even though predictable)is original and very very funny. It's nice to see a film where you sit, relax, enjoy yourself without having to expect the impossible and just experience it for what it is Fresh and Heart warming.

I was awed by the overall atmosphere the movie conveyed upon first viewing, and was shocked that every subsequent time I saw it, it just got better and better.  Even to this today, I notice something new and different upon each viewing.Critics who complain that the movie doesn't have a plot miss the point. First of all, there is a plot, albeit a wacky and zany one (a Coen Brother's trademark), that many people may not fully understand on first viewing. Second, the plot is only there to serve as a background for the amazing characters, scenes, and dialogue that the movie focuses on.   The interplay between `The Dude' & `Walter' is absolutely hysterical.  Just one example that comes to mind (I could've picked just about any bowling scene)  is Walter commenting on the Gulf War, comparing `the man in the black pagamas' to the current adversary, `a bunch of f**eaters where towels on their heads, trying to find reserve on a Russian tank' while The Dude is painting his nails.I could go on and on about my favorite scenes, but I'd just have to recite the entire movie, because every single scene is so exceptional.  From the repeated dialogue (`this aggression will not stand', `chinamen', `Pilar'), to the incredible fadeouts and transitions (`that wasn't here toe, dude'), you really have to see it multiple times to understand just how incredibly well-crafted this movie really is.In my mind, The Big Lebowski is the best of the Coen Bros.' movies, outdistancing Barton Fink.

The acting is superb (especially Mark Wahlberg) and so is the directing by Wolfgang Petersen. However something is missing, but it is hard to put a finger on it. The story is a little too brief, it feels like the movie tells a tale, but leaves out all the interesting stuff and concentrates on the action.

I turned it off out of boredom and confusion. At that time I knew nothing about WWII, nor did I really care.Lately, I have been reading alot about WWII,Hitler,Himmler, and have been reading survivor stories from concentration camp survivors, particularly Auschwitz. I have also read many stories on the other concentration camps, and have come across many more stories of camp and ghetto survivors, and have read them all with sadness, but with interest. I have even had the pleasure of corresponding with an Auschwitz survivor and Schindlers List seems VERY realistic as to what actually happened in the camps and ghettos.The movie is very easy to understand if you have basic knowledge of WWII and the holocaust. Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler, a NAZI businessman who wants to hire some camp jews as cheap slave labor to work for him (as many many companies did back then). These people that work for him are treated with a little respect and given decent working conditions. Soon many other Jews are depserate to work for him, as they realise that could mean they will not die in the camps. Oskar starts to get extremely irritated when he learns that the evil camp SS Amon Goeth (played by Ralph Fiennes) is killing many of his workers without good cause and wants the killings to stop. He then finds out that many of his workers will be sent to Auschwitz, where death is almost certain, unless something is done. He then uses his power and money to bribe many high ranking Nazi officials to bringing his workers to another country via train to have them work in a plant, where they will be saved from execution. Although he loses just about everything in the process, saving the lives of more than 1000 Jews proved worth it in the end, afterall, You save one life...you save the world entire. I was surprised they even threw in a small role of the Angel of Death, the evil Dr. Josef Mengele, who basically was responsible for the death of many many Jews, via the gas chamber, and his horrible, cruel,useless experiments. He was the one at Auschwitz who walked around determining who was fit to work, and who should die.

With `Me, Myself & Irene,' the same zany duo that brought us `There's Something About Mary,' have outdone themselves, and this time around they have Jim Carrey, again, to boot.  If ever there was a marriage made in cinematic comedic heaven, it's Carrey and the Farrelly brothers.  `Dumb and Dumber' (which also starred Carrey) was just a warm up for this one, though.  Here Carrey plays an eighteen year veteran of the Rhode Island highway Patrol, whose wife left him early in his career, not long after delivering triplets (all boys), the father of whom Charlie (Carrey) obviously is not.  Mild mannered, good guy Charlie never questions the lineage, however, and when the story picks up, the three are highly intelligent (their parents were both MENSA presidents), strapping (to say the least) boys, who share a loving relationship with their father.  Charlie is just too good for his own sake, though, and after years of suppressed anger and avoiding any kind of confrontation, the dam finally bursts. His psychological needs have created a split personality, and `Hank' emerges with a vengeance.  He quickly winds up in trouble and on medication, but it's only the beginning for him.  He's assigned to take a prisoner, Irene (Renee Zellweger), to upstate New York, where she is wanted on a bogus hit-and-run beef.  The real problem is, a former boyfriend thinks she's been privy to some shady dealings in which he's been involved, that have to do with his golf course (where she was greenskeeper), and the DEQ.  *SPOILER ALERT*  Soon Charlie and Irene are being pursued by a wrong cop (Chris Cooper) and a crooked DEQ agent (Richard Jenkins), and `Hank' takes over when Charlie just can't stand the heat.  And so begins the laugh filled adventures of Charlie, Hank and Irene. \tJim Carrey really breaks loose in this one, in what amounts to a duel role. Charlie is such a nice guy, totally benign, who gets no respect on the job or from the people in town, but who is nevertheless a stand-up fellow and good father.  When Hank emerges, though, all bets are off; affecting a Clint Eastwood, `Dirty Harry' style vocal rasp and an intimidating demeanor, the least civic infraction or personal affront no longer goes unattended.  If there was ever any doubt about it, Carrey here proves that he is nothing less than a master of physical transformation; his initial change into Hank is awesome to behold, and as the story progresses he slips effortlessly between one character and the other, and his final confrontation (with himself) is a riot.  And he does it by dexterously taking it to the edge without going completely over the top into the ridiculous.  Zellweger gives a notable performance, as well; initially somewhat nondescript, she warms up as things move along, and ultimately her Irene emerges as a rather endearing character. It's a tough part, given the fact that she is competing, somewhat, in what is predominately a showpiece for Carrey, but she is just winsome enough to keep herself in the running throughout.  The supporting cast includes Robert Forster (the Lieutenant, Captain, Colonel) and Michael Bowman (Whitey). \tAs with all of their movies, this offering from Peter and Bobby Farrelly is not going to be for everyone; it is politically incorrect and anything but subtle from beginning to end.  But it is funny, at times hysterical, and it's one of Carrey's best performances, one in which he aptly demonstrates just how versatile he really is.  There are some over-the-top, gross-out sight gags, definitely not for the squeamish, and some of the language is off-color.  If you're familiar with the Farrelly's previous work, you'll know what to expect; if not, just steel yourself and get ready for a wild ride.  No matter what your personal sensitivity level is, you're going to laugh at `Me, Myself & Irene,' even if it's in spite of yourself.  At the very least, you're going to find out what all the fuss is over Jim Carrey.

I did. A lot. Mainly because it was tricky, it was unpredictable, it made something new by playing on audiences expectations of the old, but its these expectations of old that MI2 sticks directly to. Right to a fault.You may say, hey, its a proven formula, why not stick with it. So, yes, MI2 does have some good action, some great action. If that is what you came to see, that is what you are going to get. Some good action.The thing is, I expected so much more from John Woo. I knew he was going to destroy everything the original stood for and turn it into an action movie with kung fu, explosions, and who can forget, pigeons, and I was absolutely blown away by Face\/Off, and excitied by the MI2 trailer, so what then was the problem. Well... I suppose my expectations may have been too high, exciting yes, but new, different or special, no. Just above average really.Then the plot... uh, well, usually in action movies they spend as little time on the plot as possible. This, however is a Mission Impossible film so you must, must include all sorts of espionage and hi-tech bits and pieces and face swapping (what do these people conveniently walk around with a bag with other peoples faces in it). So a lot of time is spent on plot, while it is paper thin they've tried to complex it up, but they still cannot save it. Just another terrorist thriller plot. Should have just left it as an excuse for more action. And the romance, the supposed backbone of the story, well, although Thandie Newton is one sexy lass, it is a thoroughly rushed, unbelievable, and subsequently indifferent romance. Who cares? I didn't. And John Woo, master of the over the top, who pulls of brilliant action scenes, explosions and slow motion hero shots in Face\/Off, which was just over-the-top to begin with so it was a lot of fun, here though every thing is taken to seriously and Woo's direction just seems off the mark, tacky, and in the case of Tom Cruise's hero shots, dare I say, homoerotic. All this and the returning characters from MI were bastardized along with the rest of it. If you want good action, see the movie, if you want to see a landmark action film, wait for another.

The premise of the story is that a young child played by Osment is able to see dead people as easy as you or I can see the living.  What do these dead people want of him??  Dr Malcolm Crowe ( played by willis) offers his help to unlock the mystery.  **** Do not read this next paragraph if you don't want to learn of the ending****       Ok, this is a great film, no doubt about that.  The ending is one of the best as well.. But I bring attention to the fact that if Crowe is suppose to be dead all along yet HE DOESN'T KNOW HE IS DEAD, why don't we see crowe trying to interact with the living?????? He is suppose to be alive yet wouldn't it seem a bit out of the ordinary if your wife never talks to you??  OR in the case of when he went to see Cole at his house, he is sitting with cole's mom--- wouldn't it seem feasible to want to strike up a discussing with the mother of a boy whom you are trying to solve his mental problems???     I just find it hard to believe that a man would not try to communicate with anyone throughout the duration of the time he is examining Cole, beacause he is DEAD so therefore if he did, he would surely realize something is wrong, why would everyone ignore him? hmm     This is about the only point of the movie that keeps it from a 10 for me.  The plot is well-developed, and Willis does a good job portraying Crowe.   Osment is the real star of this movie though.  The kid puts on one heck of a performance!  You believe his pain, his fear, and want to see his problems resolved.   Also, I would have liked to see Cole help the ghosts in his house ( the wife and the kid with the bullet wound) and maybe tell the audience a little more about the backgrounds of the ghosts to add more of an eerie twist.   But a solid movie nonetheless  8 out of 10 p.s. if you like this movie watch Jacob's Ladder, another psychological thriller with a litter darker theme ","genre":null},{"date":"5 July 2000","score":"","review":"      This film contains a great combination of horror, mystery, drama, and sci-fi all conglomerated into the same film.

The tension it creates is incredible, I mean I was on the edge of my seat watching it.Look at me, gushing over the movie I was least looking forward to this summer, who woulda thunk it? Well, when I first saw the trailer about 6 months back I thought, Ooo, a storm movie. Whoopee. As it got closer to release I learned that it was based on a true story, and I also read how it turned out for the real life crew of the Andrea Gail. I thought that this might get in the way of my enjoyment of the movie, but it really doesn't (you know how a lot of historical movies will end, but that never stops you from enjoying the good ones. Was the ending to The Messenger The Story of Joan of Ark a surprise to anyone?).Great cast of fellas everyone likes. Clooney is on a hot streak, he should be pulling in the big paychecks by now. The bar has officially been raised folks. $25 million to Gibson for The Patriot! A handful of the best and brightest are on the phone with their agents now, i'll bet. Meanwhile, Schwarzenneger, Van Damme and Stallone are getting grief from the supermarket clerk when the try to use their food stamps. Sorry guys.Clooney and Wahlberg together again, Wahlberg and Reilley together again. Who wants to bet there wasn't some serious hard drinking and skirt chasing after work on that set? I also want to mention William Fichtner, who I've been dying to see more of since his hillarious performance in Go. He definately stands out as 'Talent most deserving of wider recognition'. He's been playing bit parts for years and I hope he really gets the chance to flex his muscles sometime in a big film, but his is not a big role in The Perfect Storm. Oh well.Complaints? Sure, I have a few. Only minor stuff. I thought it ended rather abruptly. I don't know, I was expecting more. This was a little odd for a summer blockbuster. It's a true story, still fresh in the minds of some people I'm sure, and it's a special effects film. It's a tightrope that this movie walks across. It's entertainment, but it also has to be very careful in its treatment of the events leading up to and during the storm, in respect to all those involved with the rescue and those on board the Andrea Gail. I think it succeeds, and I don't believe the movie ever went for cheap thrills or was manipulative. I give her an 8\/10 stars. G'night!
