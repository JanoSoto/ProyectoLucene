At first interested primarily in the publicity that the case will bring, he comes to believe that his client is truly innocent, much to the chagrin of the prosecutor,Janet Venable.In the process of Vail's investigation,he discovers that powerful civic leaders, including the District Attorney, have lost millions in real estate investments due to a decision by the Archbishop not to develop certain church lands. The archbishop received numerous death threats as a result. He also learns that the archbishop had been sexually abusing altar boys, including Stampler.Introducing this evidence to the court, while it would make Stampler more sympathetic to the jury, would also give his client a motive for murder, something the prosecution otherwise has lacked.The trial does not proceed well for the defense, as there is considerable evidence against Stampler and public opinion holds him almost certainly guilty. When he confronts his client and accuses him of having lied, Aaron breaks down and transforms into a new persona, a violent sociopath who calls himself Roy,who confesses to the murder of the archbishop and throws Vail against the wall, injuring him.When this incident is over, Aaron appears to have no recollection of it.The psychiatrist examining Aaron, is convinced he suffers from multiple personality disorder due to childhood abuse by his own father.However, he cannot enter an insanity plea during an ongoing trial.Then,Vail sets up a confrontation in court. After Venable questions him harshly, Aaron turns into Roy and charges at her, threatening to snap her neck if anyone comes near him. Aaron is subdued by courthouse marshals and is rushed back to his cell. In light of Aaron's apparent insanity, the judge dismisses the jury in favor of a bench trial and then finds Aaron not guilty by reason of mental insanity, and remands him to a mental hospital.In the final scenes,Vail visits Aaron.But in the turn of events, Stampler reveals that he has been pretending to be insane the whole time. But he didn't make up the identity of Roy, he made up Aaron and now admits to having murdered the archbishop, as well as his girlfriend, Linda, whom the cleric also had molested. Stunned and disillusioned,Martin Vail walks away.Thus ends the courtroom thriller,Primal Fear,an adaptation of William Diehl's novel of the same title. It was one of the best films when it was released.Or I even consider it as one of the courtroom thrillers ever released.It stars Richard Gere as Martin Vail;Edward Norton as Aaron Stampler and Roy;and Laura Linney as Janet Venable.It was directed by Gregory Hoblit.Watch the movie for the performance of Edward Norton,in his film debut,as the schizophrenic murderer alone for he is simply outstanding.I believe the he should have won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor instead of Cuba Gooding Jr. in his portrayal of an athlete in Jerry Maguire.With regards to the attack of the movie to the sexually abusive priests in the Catholic Church,I think that it never in a way presented the institution as an immoral religion.They were simply baseless.I think that just as the novel was fiction so as the characters in the film although one cannot deny that there are some evil-doers among Catholic priests.Finally,the story provides great suspense from beginning to end as the immoral and publicity-seeking lawyer learns his lesson.Definitely a must-see.

This is a film of various different tensions in which nobody is unreservedly right or wrong. Characteristic of Pakula's films, The Devil's Own has a solemn, subdued atmosphere that mutely connotes magnitude and seriousness. Cinematographer Gordon Willis' inimitable use of light and dark is especially effective in a scene where Tom and Rory are caught in the sporadic lights of moving cars, a pertinent image for a story in which honor's moorland is so transitory.An Irish-American judge coordinates for Rory Devaney, an Irish rebel, to lodge in the suburban home of NYC police sergeant Tom O'Meara. This upright cop, his wife and their daughters haven't a clue as to Rory's real identity. While Rory is occupied obtaining Stinger missiles from Treat Williams' American gang boss, Rory discovers himself emotionally enticed by his host family's life. He hasn't known this sense of comfort and peace since childhood before his father was slain before his eyes by a British agent. As the arms deal plods on, ample time is left for the two men to connect, and for Rory to feel remorse facing Tom's morality and virtual pacifism.Meanwhile, Tom confronts the prime predicament of his career when his partner Ruben Blades shoots an unarmed offender in the back and then presumes upon him to suppress it. Tom chooses to retire. But before he can submit his badge, he's dragged into Rory's nightmare when it invades and terrorizes his home.Pitt and Ford give moving and realistic performances as two men whose fanatical dedication to justice puts them on a path to conflict. Instead of stressing epinephrine-boosting action sequences, Pakula fixes the film on the ethical clash between the resistance fighter and the unfaltering advocate of law and order. The action sequences are intermittent but vigorously ringing, with a premium put on the enduring formation of character. At an early stage of their growing personal rapport, Rory tells Tom, Don't look for a happy ending. It's not an American story. It's an Irish one. The two actors have remarkable pull on one another. When they're together on screen, you want to focus on both of them. They don't seek to trump one another, but to enforce one another's sincerity.The Devil's Own unmistakably seeks to build a father-son histrionic between Tom who has no sons and Rory, and it succeeds mainly since it never labors overmuch to labor on emphasis. Their relationship is relaxed and unaffected. A game of pool here, a snippet of conversation there. And Pakula counts on the actors to create a bond without turning to banal dialogue or unseemly bursts of emotion. These are two understated, strong-minded men who just appear to admire and enjoy one another. And when Pitt turns unreservedly cold-blooded when he's forced into a corner, Pitt gives him the disillusionment of a guy who can't meet the expense of a conscience. This point is that it's unfeasible to choose sides, a point distinctive for a Hollywood film, a battle between people whose virtues were decided by their circumstances.Naysayers called the plot incoherent, just a lot of moral grappling, not all of which relevant. Funny how they didn't say that about the character of Mike Yanagita in Fargo, for instance.

The movie's premise is not new, the script takes the more traveled route just to please a larger part of the audience that loves some easy tension, those moments when you can play the psychic with family and friends while watching together, saying That character is going to die now things like that.Once again, there's a boy who because of his constant lies no one will believe when he finally says the truth and needs help from his parents. In this case, the boy (Matt O'Leary) is in trouble after being the sole witness of a crime committed by Rick, his stepfather (Vince Vaughn), arranged for life now that he recently married with Susan (Teri Polo), who divorced the boy's father (John Travolta). After that, it's a battle to prove that Rick is a killer and needs to stay away from his new family.Let's face it, the kid is a brat! The movie would be interesting if the writers take the father away and let the kid try to make things for himself, because he knows how to cause trouble and he could play fire with fire against his step dad. imagine this kid being a dangerous type who can challenge his opponent family member, knowing how to make the other guy a living hell, blackmailing the guy or doing tricky things, trying to survive the whole situation and we would have a greater picture. Instead, there's this other known thing. It's too damn predictable! You can always tell what's going to happen next, surprises are so rare to find in here.However, anyone can and will enjoy this flick due to fact the cast united here is very good even playing some dumb roles. Matt O'Leary and Steve Buscemi (as the mysterious Ray Coleman) are the best in the show; Vaughn and Travolta got a little bit ridiculous playing heavy clichéd figures, evil versus good. But it's not a great example of what Harold Becker knows how to do in terms of thriller (the spectacular ones City Hall, Malice and Sea of Love). Domestic Disturbance is quite good, watchable but it's light years from being a helluva of a movie.10 years later and we're still waiting for another Becker's film, back in shape, but it looks like we're not gonna see that so early and this might be his last picture.

Although Steinbeck's original thoughts and emotions are written down in the text, John Ford and this cast do a superb job of conveying these emotions and thoughts on screen. Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad, and does so flawlessly. Each character has their own influence on making this movie great in different ways. At first, we see Tom fresh out of jail, naive to the current times and angry with people and the world in general for the state most people are in during the depression. Toward the end, Tom realizes he can't control every situation presented him, and matures over the course of the film by accepting things that he can't change. Although he carries with him good intentions, the Joad's and many like them are victims of the times.Steinbeck's novel is a classic, and I think that John Ford does an excellent job of paying his due diligence through this movie. If you are familiar with Steinbeck you'll already know that he writes of many things simultaneously, that is, many of the things he says can be taken at face value or delved into deeply and contemplated end over end. John Ford understands this, and it shows in scenes where his characters give monologues, usually with close up shots to show the raw emotion in their faces. At the end of the movie we see Tom saying farewell to his mother before leaving the ranch. Mrs. Joad inquires, What'll you do Tom, go off? How'll you survive- what if you get killed? I'd never see you again, to which Tom replies, Ma I'll be everywhere helpin' out the everyman. (If I were to die) I'll be there when a cop is beatin' a poor fella for no reason, where children laugh because they're hungry, an' they know supper's ready... I'll be everywhere. It is here that we see Tom's change in his character, which is reflective of the entire country at the time. Beaten and broken, most are forced to fend for themselves in hopes of finding better days. Tom is the opposite, looking out for those he loves and complete strangers simultaneously.This movie reflects the nation as a whole of the time, and gives us a peek into the simple will and desire of those folks to merely get by without worrying about starving or having a place to sleep at night. As Ma Joad says, We'll keep on forever 'cause we're the people. Born on this dirt, live, die, and pass on to the youngster's here, we'll keep on going forever. See it, read it, love it.

But a girl prays for a hero and than there comes the gun-slinging preacher who fights for what is right. And than you get the story. But the movie has more to it than the generic element you would expect from the plot. Clint is very used to playing a lone-wolf gunfighter in many of his western, but this time he plays more of a righteous gunslinger. Anyways Clint was able to add elements to the characters for what would have ended up being a standard western story to something more. This isn't one of the best western Clint has directed but that isn't to say this is not a good western. In fact this western is close to being great, just isn't one of the best I seen when it comes to this genre. Although this movie comes out a bit dry at times, it still got my attention most of the way through though because of certain aspects of this film. What really stands out about this western is the strong dialogue though, it isn't one of the greatest but it still stood out. Sometimes the exchange of dialogue between characters is enough to get the attention in this movie. So through the interaction and emotions shown in this movie is what really drives this western for the most part.

Patton emerged as the most accomplished battle commander in WWII.From his troop training in the US prior to the North African invasion (which he led), galvanizing US forces after Kasserine Pass, his leadership in the invasion of Sicily, his establishment of American equal command in Sicily to Montgomery's after an impassioned address to theatre commander Alexander, his dynamic leadership in securing first Palermo & then Messina, to his un-excelled leadership in the Normandy breakout, his brilliant foresight in the concept of breaking off a full winter attack in order to re-direct his forces toward the German encirclement of Bastogne & his subsequent relief of the embattled town, and his successful crossing of the Rhine ahead of any other allied forces all while his supplies were curtailed by his rapid advances as well as a jealous Montgomery.He bristled at the weak leadership displayed by his superiors and contemporaries alike, both American and British.

The mix of whimsy and melancholy will puzzle some, who may ask how seriously they are meant to take it? Its length and occasional problems with continuity will put others off. Added to this, what is intended to be the central romantic relationship never quite convinces. But the film as a whole is redeemed by its sheer ambition and, most importantly, the humanity and the generosity of its vision.It's 1999 - that's seven years into the future - and the world is threatened by an orbiting satellite that carries a powerful nuclear device. Meanwhile, Henry Farber has stolen a camera of his own invention from the American government, not trusting the uses to which they might put it. He sends his son, Sam, around the world, collecting images with this device. These images are to be electronically projected into the brain of Henry's blind wife, Edith. On his travels, Sam picks up a stalker, Claire Tourneur, who is on the rebound from a broken relationship with the writer, Gene FitzPatrick. Sam collects images for his mother. Claire chases Sam. Gene chases Claire. The investigator, Philip Winter, who appeared in Wenders' previous film, 'Alice in the Cities,' chases all of them. Eventually, everyone ends up at Henry's lab in the Australian outback, the satellite having exploded and, with all communication cut off, no-one being sure whether the world is still alive. Here, the precious images are projected into Edith's head and, in the single most moving scene in any film (IMHO), she sees a picture of her San Francisco dwelling daughter Elsa, for the first time, but with no idea whether Elsa herself is still alive.And there's more to it than that. Much more.As Sam, William Hurt delivers a convincing and sympathetic performance throughout. Sam Neill is likable as Gene. Rudiger Vogler as Winter is stratospherically cool. Max von Sydow, as Henry, is intensely flawed yet utterly sympathetic and, appearing on screen only about half way through, comes close to making the second half of the movie his own. Jeanne Moreau as Edith is, at some points, heartbreakingly moving. Special mention must go to Solveig Dommartin, who played Claire and who conceived some of the story. It was clearly a labour of love for her - for example, finding that they couldn't film in China, she snuck in with a video camera and taped a few lo-fi sequences single-handed. The film's lack of immediate success must have upset her deeply, and her premature death has robbed her of the chance to witness the recognition that this lovely, warm-hearted story is, little by little, beginning to get, now that the four-hour version is available on DVD.

As far as acting goes, Kevin Bacon was fine as Tom Witzky. Katherine Erbe did a very convincing job as his wife Maggie. There are a few really decent stand-out scenes. One is when Witzky is first hypnotized at the party. That was really creepy. Another one was when he discovers the woman in the wall.The digging for the body under the house was spot on for a horror\/thriller, exactly what you want to see in this type of movie. The whole cover-up plot of the killing that occurred in the past was cleverly executed and well-done in my opinion. The final shoot out took me by surprise. The only thing I was lukewarm about was the ending when Jake hears voices from each house.But other than that, a pretty good movie for the most part and recommended to check out if you like thrillers.

Snatch will rank the top in this genre. What a movie it is! The story is centered around the 84 carat diamond rolling in different hands! It starts slowly picking up a pace and holds the viewer right till it ends. The dialogues are awesome! I think the screenplay is written so carefully that it holds the meaning in every line. To not to loose any good lines I enabled the subtitles on, literally! Brad Pitt is good! Perhaps this one is one of the most liked character of mine so far. Jason Statham in a different style as well. The way the director and writer has given slight touch of humor just makes this flick watch worth and do not make it wrong in any way. In fact the humor has been taken care of so closely that it just don't spoil the original thrill and crime theme in it and balance the movie throughout. After I watched this one, I really felt being away from such a masterpiece for so long time. I mean the movie was made in 2000 and I got chance to watch it after 11 years! Overall, nice movie to go for an entertainment if you haven't watched it yet cause it will still give the same pleasure even if time changes and we are in the completely changed world!

After a short (slightly altered) recap of the first movie, we find Ash (Bruce Campbell) still in the cabin, having survived until daylight, the last man standing. But the forces of evil still lurk in the woods, and the bridge is out, so Ash is stranded.The tone is significantly lightened this time around, with much of the film spent on watching Ash get his ass kicked inside the cabin - whether it's getting beaten over the head with glass plates (by his own possessed hand) or being doused by a spray of blood from the walls. Just witnessing Campbell wage war with his own hand is worth the price of admission. There's so much Looney Tunes comedy and Three Stooges slapstick that you can't help but laugh at Ash's abuse (which seems to be the driving force behind the making of this film).It's the prototype for the horror\/comedy we see so much of today. Even so, Evil Dead II bristles with so much manic energy, you can't help but appreciate the humor and sentiment from the filmmakers. A supremely watchable film of the highest order.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 October 2011","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Evil Dead II is a departure from the first, in that it's not a straight-up horror film.
