Also it is the film that tells us possibly the most about Bond's close friend Felix Leiter. Here he faces the same fate as Bond doe in On Her Majesty's Secret service when his wife is killed. There is also a reference directly to Bond's marriage with the garter scene. Not too common that they reference directly previous Bond movies, or even Bond girls. Tracy sure was something special. Only difference to Bond Leiter gets severely injured as well. So Bond is out there trying to catch or kill those responsible. MI6 does not approve, so Bond is out there pretty much on his own and he even has to hand in his license to kill, therefore the title. And Gladys Knight's title song, which is pretty good again as well. But don't worry, Q will help him out again and he will even play his chauffeur. Pay attention though to how it is not one of Q's gadgets that helps Bond in the final fight, but the lighter from his close friend.The intro to this film already shows us the movie's main antagonist, which is not always the case. Robert Davi plays Franz Sanchez, a super criminal to whom loyalty is everything. I really liked his performance and to me he is probably one of the five most memorable Bond villains. And Sanchez was quite a character, who has even business connection with the President and the President seems to be the one who needs Sanchez more than the other way around. The fact that one of Bond's helpers here (with a pretty unlucky fate himself) is called Sharkey surely has some irony as a henchman says as well at one point. Anyway, sharks in Bond films are always fun and if you remember Jaws (the character, not the movie), you will think of another interesting shark fight scene. Another interesting fact about this film here is that there is not really a giant muscular henchman in the likes of Jaws, Oddjob or Hans, but a mean knife fighter played by the very young Benicio Del Toro. And then there is also Krest, another henchman, quite an interesting character too. Especially his death scene is one of the most disgusting scenes in Bond history. But equally fascinating somehow.Another mention goes out to the way Timothy Dalton played Bond. Many say he is the closest to the books, but he is rarely in discussion when it is asked who was the best Bond. Anyway, Dalton portrays him as a stone-cold assassin who won't back down from anybody in his way. The scene when he kills the corrupt agent who was responsible for Sanchez' escape describes him perfectly. He gives him back his suitcase and pushes him down to the sharks this way. I though the first half of the film was slightly superior to the second, but the second is pretty good as well. Both parts offer great plot developments and approaches on loyalty, an interesting issue which is probably not dealt with in any other film as much as here, also because of the main antagonist's ideals. Oh and the Bond girls of course. They are crazy for Mr. Dalton too. Even if he does not get an Asian Bond girl so he would have them from all ethnicities as I expected before the Asian agent was killed, he has some great women drooling over him again and acting like angry jealous little girls when they won't be getting him seemingly. Carey Lowell (Richard Gere's ex-wife) and Talisa Soto, both in their prime, are as good as it gets.Finally I recommend watching this film a lot. It is pretty magnificent. I remember liking it a lot more than Dalton's other Bond film, but his first appearance, The Living Daylights certainly needs a rewatch.

Now to the date of this review, I've only seen one other of his films and that is MASH. But I would have to say that this film is better. It's a complicated film that may be worth more than one viewing, but the parody of country music is there and is done quite well. I was laughing quite a bit, but there is an explosive ending and one that came out of nowhere. Despite being a parody, the movie has quite a few excellent songs namely the one sung by Keith Carradine. There is a lot happening in the film, but this character piece is worth the initial confusion.Altman's feature film doesn't really have a defined plot. It is pretty much a tale of what goes on in Nashville, the country capital of the world for a span of several days. There are twenty-four characters whose stories are interwoven with each other. This kind of gave me a sense of what a country-style Woodstock would be like.The film doesn't have any big stars, or whom weren't at its 1975 release date. Elliot Gould may have been the biggest star, and he was just a small cameo. There are many characters here to mention, but I do have a few standouts. Lily Tomlin was excellent as the mother of several deaf kids. Keith Carradine was fabulous in his role of the womanizer. Ronee Blakley was very good as the popular country singer who is plagued by injuries. Finally, Henry Gibson as the popular country singer who always wore white was also great.Overall, Nashville is a very good movie with musical and even political overtones. That last scene reminded me of a certain historical assassination, so that was an interesting finale to watch. The music is great as I found myself singing and dancing to some of the tunes. It may not be obvious at first, but Nashville is a parody and a pretty darn good one of Southern music. Quite frankly, even with so many films under his belt and I need to see, this may be Robert Altman's best film. I rate this film 9\/10.

It is one of those very sad movies that are out there for the sole purpose of making you cry. Not only did I not cry (I didn't laugh by any means), but I was confused as there are many instances that just simply come out of the blue and are not fully explained. The acting is fantastic, the script is okay, but the plot is low and weak.In one of the best roles in his illustrious career, Sean Penn plays mentally challenged Sam Dawson. He makes his living working at Starbucks and has an entourage of four other men at his intellect. There is one scene where Sam is buying shoes for his daughter, Lucy (Fanning) and is a little bit short on bread, so his friends each pitch in some money to help Sam pay. I love that scene, as it is cute and funny, yet cheesy in a good way. I wish that more scenes were like that. Sam lives in a nice apartment with his daughter whom he loves more than anything. It never fully states how Sam had Lucy because he is a single father with a very low IQ. It briefly mentions that he knocked up a homeless girl and he does have run-ins with the law about solicitation, so I figured that he knocked up a hooker. It just never made sense to me that that would happen. Sam is too innocent to just be fooling around with just anybody. I guess it is possible, I just highly doubt it. We do see Sam and Lucy having good times together as well as Sam and his buddies having fun. Only, those bits are very brief. Most of the early scenes show Sam embarrassing himself and Lucy, and having run-ins with the law. I know that Sam is mentally challenged, but he embarrasses Lucy and himself is some bits that are unpleasant. Like there's one scene where he has a tantrum at a restaurant because they don't have his favourite breakfast. I really felt embarrassed for Lucy. Then there is the scene where the movie takes off and the plot fully begins. Sam is arrested a Lucy's birthday party and is sent to live in foster care as Sam loses custody. I always hated that scene because the cops show up just out of the blue to arrest Sam on past things that have been dropped like solicitation. Would they really just arrest a mentally challenged man like that even if they had a warrant? That scene never clicked for me. Sam decides to fight for custody as he hires an expert family lawyer (Pfieffer) who actually is laughable. She is the stereotypical and over-the-top, paranoid, workaholic mother. She does do a fine job of acting, but her character is often funny. The ending is confusing to some, but its all how you interpret it.I have always been on the fence about the general premise. Sam has the mental capacity of a 7- year-old and Lucy is holding back as she herself is 7. I know that Sam is loving and caring and patient, but he can't take care of himself. He can't teach Lucy the facts of life or guide her. Lucy would be the one taking care of Sam when she's like 10. No child should be a parent at such a young age. Her foster family has regular parents and a mother figure the Lucy needs. I don't want to ruin the ending, but the whole movie itself has always made me question things. I have experience with mentally challenged people, I found this movie to be a little bit of a mockery. The regular people are painted as even worse off than Sam in terms of intellect. Sean Penn does a dynamite portrayal and the acting in general is good, but the movie is too sad, unrealistic, unclear, and sometimes insulting.

And definitely not enough to ruin the movie heck The World Is Not Enough. We have a great and thrilling pre credit sequence that is also tide with what is about to come. A great boat chase along the river. It kicks the film of to a great start. The introduction that the villain gets is great, he doesn't arrive until 40 minutes in and its done nicely to build up for the character. Elektra and Bond have a great chemistry that gives this movie so much for the ending of their relationship, or more even the ending that she gets. And when Bond finds out that she is truly on the wrong team was nicely done. It was also good to see Robbie Coltrane re praise his role in the movie, he had more to do here than in Goldeneye and that was appreciated as was John Cleese cameo.

And definitely not enough to ruin the movie heck The World Is Not Enough. We have a great and thrilling pre credit sequence that is also tide with what is about to come. A great boat chase along the river. It kicks the film of to a great start. The introduction that the villain gets is great, he doesn't arrive until 40 minutes in and its done nicely to build up for the character. Elektra and Bond have a great chemistry that gives this movie so much for the ending of their relationship, or more even the ending that she gets. And when Bond finds out that she is truly on the wrong team was nicely done. It was also good to see Robbie Coltrane re praise his role in the movie, he had more to do here than in Goldeneye and that was appreciated as was John Cleese cameo. Bottom line is this is such a well told story that makes sense and with some great performances from all the main cast except for yes i don't have to say it. This movie is very under appreciated, it certainly belongs among the best in the series. Some people complain that there is to little action but the action is there for a reason this time! we don't need more. People have also commented on that it has little to do with Bond, heck we see who Bond really is in this film. How cold he is when he kills of Electra.. its one of the best scenes in the history of the franchise. Bond has had the enough and the world even is not enough.. he even said it himself.

There are no designated lawmen around, so things can get rough. And they do. Very suspensefully and not necessarily to a good or happy end.

When you put them together, the results are nothing less than spectacular. Case in Point, The Naked Gun From the Files of Police Squad!, which is one of the most outrageous, side splittingly hilarious comedies ever made.Neilson is perfectly cast as LAPD Lieutenant Frank Drebin, who surely must be related to the legendary inspector Clouseau. After socking it to America's enemies in the utterly ridiculous pre-title sequence, Drebin must save Queen Elizabeth II from an assassination plot at the hands of the dastardly Vincent Ludwig (Ricardo Montalbon). This would prove impossible for the spectacularly incompetent detective if not for one small fact everyone else in this movie is nearly as clueless as he is. Rarely does a movie combine as many comedic devices, or use them to such effect, as this film. Naked Gun joins together the slapstick of Keaton, the manic energy and one-liners of the Marx Brothers, and the sheer ridiculousness of Monty Python, then dials them up in a way that only the Zuckers can manage. The slapstick sequences build and build, linking together one mishap after another in a way that defies all logic. Their dialog utilizes a one of a kind mixture of double entendre, mixed metaphors, monologues, and self-negating sentences that produce some of the most quotable lines in cinema. Speaking of quotes, watch for delicious parodies of some of the best known lines from famous cop dramas.And before the movie ends, they manage to skewer practically every cliché known to the cop genre. The shootouts, the chases, the interrogations, the tearful meeting with the partner's wife, it's all here. They even managed to spoof the opening credits of practically every cop movie ever made. And no-one understands the comedic power of overstatement more than they do. Their car chases don't end in a massive fireball, they end in three. When they introduce the requisite romantic subplot, they take you through every possible variation of the semi-obligatory lyrical interlude. And when the hero's heartfelt statement of true love comes, it's so moving that it ends the Arab\/ Israeli feud. While they were at it, the Zuckers also managed to spoof the Bond franchise, and to include possibly the best sports scene in any non-sports movie. It may not be subtle, or entirely tasteful, or contain any twists that a third grader couldn't predict, but Naked Gun is just about the most fun you can have at the movies.

Stuart (Sadler) devises a plan to hold the entire airport hostage. Stuart has taken over control of all the electrical equipment affecting all the planes that are landing on the runaway. With no lights on the runaway, all planes are in trouble. If that isn't enough, McClaine's wife Holly is on one of the planes. McClaine must rediscover his nose for trouble and the heroics from the Nakatomi situation to save his wife and everybody else. No matter how hard Reny Harlin tries, this is nowhere near as good as the first movie. The first movie is a groundbreaking action movie that inspired many clones over the years. This movie is inferior like most sequels. Despite the effort, I didn't sense anything else but wanting to make money from everyone involved. It feels disingenuous and I never really bought into it. The storytelling pales in comparison and it just feels there. Sequels are very tricky because you have to make sure that it feels legitimate and not just a money-maker. This is one of those movies. All that aside, I actually do enjoy this movie a fair amount. It's action packed and Renny makes sure there is never a dull moment. The action is really brainless that feature some ridiculous OTT stunts that aren't believable for a second! McClaine escapes situations that make him look like Superman in certain scenes. Luckily, McClaine's character manages to make you feel like it was smarts and dumb luck. Despite my criticisms, it's entertaining all the same. I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the action. Memorable moments include some good scraps on the wing of a plane near the end. It does begin to drag after a while, but I did enjoy them for the most part. The performances are pretty good. Bruce Willis is great as McClaine. When he wants to be, Bruce is a fun actor that can easily carry a movie. He carries this sequel for sure. He has some awesome one- liners that he ad-libbed himself. His boorish wise cracking persona is a treat to watch and he's perfectly adept in the action scenes. He doesn't have as much to work with here, but he makes the most of it. He's a perfect everyman that anyone can relate too. Bonnie Bedelia is wasted here. Her screen time is much shorter than she had in the first. She has a couple of memorable scenes, but she's nowhere near as prominent. William Sandler is technically solid as the villain. His performance is kind of dull, though. He lacks spark and the charisma that Alan Rickman had. His intensity makes up for that somewhat. William Atherton's role is shorter as well, but he does what he does best! Play an A*hole. Dennis Franz can do this type of thing in his sleep, but he's so fun to watch with it! He's so good at what he does, it's impossible to fully dislike him. His interactions with Willis were a blast. John Amos is fun in his role. Reginald VelJohnson is limited to a cameo in this movie, which is a shame. His dynamic with Bruce in the first movie is sorely missed here. Franco Nero makes a dull bad guy. Robert Patrick and John Leguizamo show up as well. The violence is typically strong for a Harlin movie. An ice pick in the eye was the highlight, in my opinion. Even though it's my least favorite of the original trilogy, I still watch this once a year. This movie is fun!

Sure, the vampire's name has been changed, and the story moved from London to Bremen, but the plot and many of the characters remain the same. Bram Stoker's widow actually sued the filmmakers for copyright infringement, securing a court order that all copies of the film be destroyed. We are fortunate today that a handful of prints survived. Sure, Nosferatu may be a rip-off, but it's still one heck of a horror movie.The movie does have some very real problems. Although the filmmakers had one of the great novels of the previous century to work with, the problems of adapting it into a screenplay, together with the constraints inherent to all silent films medium, mean that some plot points never become all the way clear. There is also a bit of Bad Exposition Syndrome involving the film's solution. And although Professor Van Helsing appears, he never actually confronts the villain.But the issues are more than made up for by Nosferatu's sheer creepiness. Conrad Viet (?) playing the title role, sports one of the all time great horror movie makeup jobs. His pointed ears, completely bald head, narrow cheekbones, and bushy eyebrows give him an aspect that is terrible to behold. His hands are oversized, with his fingers narrowing into long claws. And forget the standard pair of fangs; all of his teeth are needle sharp, and his mouth is absolutely packed with them.This eeriness extends to practically every other aspect of the film as well. The Transylvanian castle fills the viewer with foreboding from the moment it is first seen, and the darkly lit halls and corridors within are no less disquieting. Even more menacing is the ruined manor in Bremen. Every window is broken, part of the roof is collapsed, and indeed it seems that at any moment the entire structure could come crashing down.The special effects are also worth noting. Although crude by today's standards, there is still something frightening about seeing doors open and close on their own, or coffin lids floating through the air. We know that these sights can't be real; the jerkiness of the movements tells us that something is up. But the incompleteness of the illusion only adds to the feeling that something is not right, heightening our sense of apprehension.Great advances in production values have taken place since this film was made, and I admit that Todd Browning's Dracula, made only a decade later, had much better plot and characterization. But Nosferatu is still the one of the most frightening movies I've ever seen, able to give even the hardiest of audiences nightmares. And if it can still have this effect today, just imagine what it must have been like for people watching this in 1921. It's not hard to picture many a burgher making their way home through the dark, narrow streets of Berlin or Munich, convinced that their every step was shadowed by an immortal being that lived only to suck the very life out of them, and to&#x85; You're not reading this in the dark are you?

Bram Stoker's widow actually sued the filmmakers for copyright infringement, securing a court order that all copies of the film be destroyed. We are fortunate today that a handful of prints survived. Sure, Nosferatu may be a rip-off, but it's still one heck of a horror movie.The movie does have some very real problems. Although the filmmakers had one of the great novels of the previous century to work with, the problems of adapting it into a screenplay, together with the constraints inherent to all silent films medium, mean that some plot points never become all the way clear. There is also a bit of Bad Exposition Syndrome involving the film's solution. And although Professor Van Helsing appears, he never actually confronts the villain.But the issues are more than made up for by Nosferatu's sheer creepiness. Conrad Viet (?) playing the title role, sports one of the all time great horror movie makeup jobs. His pointed ears, completely bald head, narrow cheekbones, and bushy eyebrows give him an aspect that is terrible to behold. His hands are oversized, with his fingers narrowing into long claws. And forget the standard pair of fangs; all of his teeth are needle sharp, and his mouth is absolutely packed with them.This eeriness extends to practically every other aspect of the film as well. The Transylvanian castle fills the viewer with foreboding from the moment it is first seen, and the darkly lit halls and corridors within are no less disquieting. Even more menacing is the ruined manor in Bremen. Every window is broken, part of the roof is collapsed, and indeed it seems that at any moment the entire structure could come crashing down.The special effects are also worth noting. Although crude by today's standards, there is still something frightening about seeing doors open and close on their own, or coffin lids floating through the air. We know that these sights can't be real; the jerkiness of the movements tells us that something is up. But the incompleteness of the illusion only adds to the feeling that something is not right, heightening our sense of apprehension.Great advances in production values have taken place since this film was made, and I admit that Todd Browning's Dracula, made only a decade later, had much better plot and characterization. But Nosferatu is still the one of the most frightening movies I've ever seen, able to give even the hardiest of audiences nightmares. And if it can still have this effect today, just imagine what it must have been like for people watching this in 1921. It's not hard to picture many a burgher making their way home through the dark, narrow streets of Berlin or Munich, convinced that their every step was shadowed by an immortal being that lived only to suck the very life out of them, and to&#x85; You're not reading this in the dark are you?

Here they turn the situation on its head by substituting a whiny prince for the beautiful princess, and manage to skewer both sappy song-and-dance numbers and mindless violence while they're at it. Witch hunts are another familiar subject. We've all seen plenty of witch burnings in the movies, but this is the first time that the accused witch is tried using the latest scientific methods. The logic displayed here is more tortured than Pavarotti at a Tiny Tim concert as Scott Adams would say, and it's absolutely side splitting.Holy Grail was the epitome of randomness long before the term had been coined.

They make a bet with one another that they can switch the lives of two people, a successful commodities broker with their firm and a homeless beggar. They arrange for the broker, Louis (pronounced Lewis, not Louie) Winthorpe III, to be fired from his job, evicted from his luxurious home and arrested on trumped-up charges of theft and drug-dealing. They then approach the beggar, Billy Ray Valentine, and offer him not only Winthorpe's job but also his house. Winthorpe is reduced to despair by this sudden crumbling of his world, but Billy Ray proves an unexpected success in his new role, as though his life on the streets has given him an instinctive understanding of the economic facts of life. When Billy Ray and Winthorpe (who has been befriended by a prostitute named Ophelia) discover the trick that has been played on them, they combine to seek revenge on the Dukes.Film critics like Roger Ebert and Janet Maslin compared Trading Places to the comedies of earlier directors such as Frank Capra and Preston Sturges, and it reminded me of the screwball comedies of the thirties and forties. Of course, if it had been made during that period it would have been very different. Billy Ray would almost certainly have been white; here he is black. On the other hand Winthorpe's butler Coleman, who here is white, might have been black, as domestic servants were one of the few types of role exempt from Hollywood's unofficial colour-bar. Ophelia would probably have been a poor-but-honest working-class girl rather than a hooker. And in the days of the Production Code there would have been no toplessness, no sex references and none of the bad language with which the film is liberally sprinkled.Thinking how the film might have been made in the past also made think of how it might be remade today. Today, of course, there would be no objection to casting a black star. Indeed, the film-makers might even be daring enough to make Winthorpe black and Billy Ray white. Although the colour-bar had gone in the sixties, in 1983 there was still a tendency to think of black actors in terms of working-class roles. The idea of making a wealthy, aristocratic character black would probably have been a little too far outside the box for the eighties.I suspect, however, that a lot of the sex and bad language would go. In 1983 the cinema was still suffering from a seventies hangover, and it was a defining principle of the Decade that Taste Forgot that film- makers were under a solemn duty to show just how hip, trendy and adult they were by breaking as many taboos as they thought they could get away with. Today this attitude is not as prevalent as it once was- gratuitous bad language and sexual references often seem more adolescent than adult. Trading Places, which is essentially about money, class and status, is not a sex comedy or a gross-out comedy, so a lot of the sex and profanity could safely be discarded. A modern remake would doubtless also dispense with all that eighties political incorrectness (Of course there's something wrong with him. He's a Negro!).In some respects, however, this is a very modern story. Its satire on greed and corruption among the super-rich leaders of the financial services industry is just as relevant to the post-Lehman Brothers world of the 2010s as it was to the greed is good eighties. Moreover, its satire is not just relevant to America. One thing that struck me was just how British the rich characters seem to be. The Duke brothers' surname was presumably deliberately chosen to suggest a link to the British aristocracy, and their country house is a self-conscious replica of an English stately home in the Tudor style, down to the stained-glass windows. Louis lives in the Philadelphia equivalent of a Georgian London townhouse and employs an English butler. His upper-class chums all wear English-style cricket sweaters, although none of them presumably play cricket. He even speaks with a quasi-British accent. (This is particularly noticeable with the short o in words like job which Louis is careful to pronounce in the rounded British manner; most Americans either flatten this vowel (jaahb) or drawl it (jawb). The acting is of a generally high standard. Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy combine well as the two men whose lives are inadvertently swapped. Aykroyd's Louis is honest, good at his job, intelligent and well- educated, and yet he is a classic example of the man who is, paradoxically, limited by his very intelligence and education.

","genre":null},{"date":"7 January 2015","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The brothers Randolph and Mortimer Duke are the wealthy owners of a Philadelphia-based commodity dealership. They make a bet with one another that they can switch the lives of two people, a successful commodities broker with their firm and a homeless beggar. They arrange for the broker, Louis (pronounced Lewis, not Louie) Winthorpe III, to be fired from his job, evicted from his luxurious home and arrested on trumped-up charges of theft and drug-dealing. They then approach the beggar, Billy Ray Valentine, and offer him not only Winthorpe's job but also his house. Winthorpe is reduced to despair by this sudden crumbling of his world, but Billy Ray proves an unexpected success in his new role, as though his life on the streets has given him an instinctive understanding of the economic facts of life. When Billy Ray and Winthorpe (who has been befriended by a prostitute named Ophelia) discover the trick that has been played on them, they combine to seek revenge on the Dukes.Film critics like Roger Ebert and Janet Maslin compared Trading Places to the comedies of earlier directors such as Frank Capra and Preston Sturges, and it reminded me of the screwball comedies of the thirties and forties. Of course, if it had been made during that period it would have been very different. Billy Ray would almost certainly have been white; here he is black. On the other hand Winthorpe's butler Coleman, who here is white, might have been black, as domestic servants were one of the few types of role exempt from Hollywood's unofficial colour-bar. Ophelia would probably have been a poor-but-honest working-class girl rather than a hooker. And in the days of the Production Code there would have been no toplessness, no sex references and none of the bad language with which the film is liberally sprinkled.Thinking how the film might have been made in the past also made think of how it might be remade today. Today, of course, there would be no objection to casting a black star. Indeed, the film-makers might even be daring enough to make Winthorpe black and Billy Ray white. Although the colour-bar had gone in the sixties, in 1983 there was still a tendency to think of black actors in terms of working-class roles. The idea of making a wealthy, aristocratic character black would probably have been a little too far outside the box for the eighties.I suspect, however, that a lot of the sex and bad language would go. In 1983 the cinema was still suffering from a seventies hangover, and it was a defining principle of the Decade that Taste Forgot that film- makers were under a solemn duty to show just how hip, trendy and adult they were by breaking as many taboos as they thought they could get away with. Today this attitude is not as prevalent as it once was- gratuitous bad language and sexual references often seem more adolescent than adult. Trading Places, which is essentially about money, class and status, is not a sex comedy or a gross-out comedy, so a lot of the sex and profanity could safely be discarded. A modern remake would doubtless also dispense with all that eighties political incorrectness (Of course there's something wrong with him. He's a Negro!).In some respects, however, this is a very modern story. Its satire on greed and corruption among the super-rich leaders of the financial services industry is just as relevant to the post-Lehman Brothers world of the 2010s as it was to the greed is good eighties. Moreover, its satire is not just relevant to America. One thing that struck me was just how British the rich characters seem to be. The Duke brothers' surname was presumably deliberately chosen to suggest a link to the British aristocracy, and their country house is a self-conscious replica of an English stately home in the Tudor style, down to the stained-glass windows. Louis lives in the Philadelphia equivalent of a Georgian London townhouse and employs an English butler. His upper-class chums all wear English-style cricket sweaters, although none of them presumably play cricket. He even speaks with a quasi-British accent. (This is particularly noticeable with the short o in words like job which Louis is careful to pronounce in the rounded British manner; most Americans either flatten this vowel (jaahb) or drawl it (jawb). The acting is of a generally high standard. Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy combine well as the two men whose lives are inadvertently swapped. Aykroyd's Louis is honest, good at his job, intelligent and well- educated, and yet he is a classic example of the man who is, paradoxically, limited by his very intelligence and education. He is quite unable to imagine what life might be those who did not go to Harvard and who do not have a job in high finance.

My major problem with this movie is the casting of the two youngest children of 'the Doc' and Manulani - Sarah and Luki were in no way children of the Doc and Manulani - Leilani looked the part and played it well but Sarah and Luki each had at least one Chinese parent. They could not have had an Hawaiian mother and a Caucasian father. The visual clash really interfered with their being presented as Leilani's siblings. The two child actors did well - but couldn't overcome their appearance. Trying to pass them off as half Hawaiian and half Caucasian was really an insult to them and their own heritage. My other problem with it was the spanking scene - I know, those kinds of scenes were in several movies of that time period but even then I found the 'it's okay to spank a woman to get her to behave the way you (the man) want her to behave' was objectionable. Other than those two issues .. an entertaining movie.

After hearing about the concept of this film and the nature revolved around it, I decided to sit down and watch it. Conveniently, Youtube has the entire unedited film in its entirety for free to view. On first note, I must identify the superb acting of Justin Pierce as Casper and may his tragic suicide in 2000 be noted and perhaps this role had a daunting effect on him. Kids today are curious, and this film exploits the innocence of adolescence to a the underground world of drugs and unprotected sex. This highly critical portrait of 90s youth is a phenomenal commentary on the ignorance of adult society as parents need to be aware of what their children are up to. This film presents a message through a highly disturbing and engaging 90 minutes of drugs and teenage fornication. For a shaky independent film, Kids will leave a lasting feeling on those who view it and hopefully will provide a critical point of view to parents who let their children out past midnight. I recommend this film to everyone as it shows us the life of uneducated and rebellious children who don't know anything about reality. Phenomenal work of art and excellent criticism on the dark side of youth. PARENTS MUST WATCH THIS FILM.

No names are given till the very end of the movie and then it is only 2 jurors, apart from a quick scene in the courtroom and outside at the end, the rest of the movie is filmed in the jurors room on a hot stinky summers days.
