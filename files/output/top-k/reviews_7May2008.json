There's even a part where he is asking a shady character played by Roger Moore called Lord Edgar Dobbs (Dobbs, Lord Dobbs&#133;) to buy him so he can have a chance to go to a mysterious place called the Lost City to enter an ultra-secret fighting championship and win his freedom and maybe a little glory along the way.Sadly, the plot is one of the weakest I've seen in a Van Damme movie, which is not a good thing. The first hour comes across as almost an excuse just to get to the fight scenes at the end, which resemble some of his earliest fighting movie like Bloodsport and Kickboxer, but here are so brief and watered down that they are meaningless. It would be better if they just described them. But I'll get to that later.Clearly, Chris' motivation is to get his freedom, but there is also the matter of this fighting tournament, which is a little difficult to understand. The best fighters from all of a dozen or more different countries are there to find out who is the best in the world. It's sort of like the Olympics for fighting with all those nations represented, except it's super-secret so there is no publicity and no recognition for their achievements. One journalist is there, but she had to pull a serious amount of strings in order to get there. These must be fighting purists, the guys that do it for the spiritual reasons and not the money or fame.Anyway, this Lord Dobbs becomes interested when Chris explains to him that the prize for winning the tournament is a big dragon made of solid gold, so Chris is able to enlist his help in getting to the tournament, provided he can win his freedom if he shares the prize with him. All of this is generally irrelevant, of course. The movie exists just for the fight scenes, but sadly, once they finally get started it quickly becomes one of the most disappointing parts of the whole movie.The tournament takes place somewhere called the Lost City, which is described as the top of the world. Maybe this is meant to evoke something like Lhasa, the capital city of Tibet, which calls itself the roof of the world. There's no resemblance, but it's an interesting coincidence. Anyway, soon we learn that there is more to risk than getting the tar beaten out of you. One of the fight officials ominously warns Chris that, if he loses, he can never leave the Lost City.How's that again? Such stipulations are always a complete mystery to me. When I was in Tibet last summer, we took a trip to Namtso Lake a couple hours north of Lhasa, which claims to be the highest lake in the world at about 5200 meters (I'm pretty sure that there are dozens that are much, much higher, but no matter), the locals at the lake told us that the lake was sacred to them, so if you bathe in it, or even just wash your face or hands or feet, your punishment will be that they'll never let you leave. Uh-huh. Who would they really be punishing? Anyway, the actual tournament looks like a video game, a cartoonishly overblown ceremonial setup that reminds me of Mortal Kombat, which I understand is one of Van Damme's worst movies ever. I haven't seen it, but I can certainly imagine! Each country is represented by a goofy stereotype, often in wildly inappropriate attire. There is the German fighter who looks exactly like a Nazi, complete with calf-high standard issue military work boots, the Japanese sumo-wrestler, the squirrelly Chinese guy, the mountainous, frightening Mongolian (who doesn't look remotely Mongolian, but no matter), etc.What I especially love is that every fighter comes out, does some bizarre dance, and then the fight begins and ends within 10-15 seconds without fail. The Turkish fighter, who looks like one of the toughest fighters of all of them, gets shoved backwards by the sumo-wrestler and then I guess he just passes out. I've never seen anyone get knocked out from being pushed, but it happens in this movie. Anyway, things get strangely familiar again when Chris takes off the headband of a fallen friend, swearing revenge with an evil stare at the scary Mongolian. This is as goofy as it gets, but for some reason it's still fun to watch Van Damme in this kind of situation. Too bad the rest of the movie is so bad.What I mean by that, of course, is things like the conclusion of the movie, where Lord Dobbs and his hapless sidekick attempt to steal the golden horse, which has cleverly been left out in the middle of an open courtyard during the tournament, with so little security that no one notices when they try to steal it using a BLIMP. You see, they figure it's too heavy for anyone to carry off, which renders even the most conspicuous and noticeable vehicle perfectly acceptable. NICE.The end of the movie is abrupt and cheesy, complete with a ham-handed moral and a totally uncreative mention of the future of the cast. At least Lord Dobbs mentions that he's a pirate, but used to be a captain in the Royal Navy. Interesting because that's what most pirates were in real life before they turned to a life of crime. Sadly, there's not much else here.

Just hands down a terrible film. Writing stinks, the direction stinks, and overall the performances are just mailed in.

It is also an example that, for producers, who want to create movies for people to view this world in a better way and aware of social responsibilities, they should make the movie like this.This movie is not for people who like western movies just to satisfy their basic instinct and never understand the real cowboy life and the cowboy code. It is not for people who wants to enjoy nonsense violent and killing as one can expect from Italian cowboy movies. It is not a movie in the kind of The Good, The Bad and the Ugly that made Clint Eastwood famous. It is a movie about how a real man in reality should be. For this world, trying to avoid violence, keep your promises, protect a man's and woman's honor when ever necessary, are what we are dreaming for in our society today.You have to prepare that this is not an action western movie but a sensitive western drama for people who care about being someone in his\/her society. It shows that people can not ignore culture and tradition of their community. This is a good movie that I want today's teenagers to see and to learn how good men and women should be.Many people may not like it because it does not satisfy their dark side instincts but I watch movie not because of that reason. The hero John Grady Cole in this movie is the best role model for a real cowboy as I've ever seen. I watched more than 100 western titles, to me, all those heroes as played by John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, Charles Bronsons, Alan Ladd, Gregory Peck, Gene Autry, Roy Rogers can not match John Grady Cole in this movie.

Although the movie-going public ignored the film at the time, Bluth's subsequent films, An American Tail and the marginally superior The Land Before Time both broke box-office records for animation and routed Disney competition.In 1989, Bluth's fourth, All Dogs Go to Heaven, was released on the same weekend as Disney's latest, The Little Mermaid, a musical in the style of the Golden Age cartoons. Bluth's new film boasted an interesting and original premise, whilst Disney's was yet another sweetened fairy tale. Bluth and his cohorts could hardly be blamed to maybe shoot for fifty million this time around, and Disney fans would have been either in denial or omniscient to expect The Little Mermaid to be other than lackluster.The Little Mermaid raked in $84,000,000. People tell you that the business a film does doesn't matter, but it does it matters a helluva lot to the films a studio makes after it. Without The Little Mermaid's extravagant success, the resurgence in American animation might never have taken place, and we have audiences' uncharacteristic discernment to thank.Above all, what is important about The Little Mermaid is what a superlative film it is. A penny saved might well be a penny earned, but a few billion pennies spent wisely can be millions and millions of dollars earned. This is The Little Mermaid's approach, and but one of many ways in which it returned to the Disney philosophy of the Thirties and Forties, when art was exalted above immediate financial gain, when no expense was spared in the pursuit of excellence, and when animation was considered a medium and not a genre, when an animated film was more than a 'kiddie movie'.Computers eased the burden on the animators and the studio's pockets, making the sort of dazzling imagery that characterized the early Disney films practical again, also enabling certain wildly impressive sequences to be brought to the screen in a manner that would have had Uncle Walt selling his multi-plane camera for scrap.And then there was the duo of Howard Ashman and Alan Menken. The pair made The Little Mermaid's score Disney's best since Dumbo, and truly animated Broadway for the first time. The songs are longer, better placed and more important to the plot than ever before, and not a dud among them. Part of Your World is the obligatory ballad, but, refreshingly, it's not a love song--even more refreshingly, The Little Mermaid doesn't really have one of those; Kiss the Girl is far too witty and entertaining to be one, and is more concerned with making out than love anyway. Poor Unfortunate Souls is deliciously wicked, and Under the Sea is pure entertainment, a showcase for Samuel E. Wright's magnificent crab, Sebastian, and a virtuoso display of animated choreography. The use of song might seem unsubtle as compared to the great animated films of the Nineties, like The Iron Giant and the Toy Story films, but it is never less than enjoyable. And by the way, it was co-producer Ashman's idea to make Sebastian a Jamaican-vizier-crab as opposed to an English-butler-crab. Masterstroke, that.Remember how scary Pinocchio was? (The movie, not the puppet.) While The Little Mermaid does not quite plumb those depths, it is bold in its occasional darkness Ursula's grisly garden and many forms, the seriousness of Ariel's situation and the despair that accompanies it, ensure that, for all its humor, the film never suffers from the childlike levity that Disney films, for time out of mind, had been trying to make adults take seriously. When it means to be funny, the film is funny; when not, not.Certainly Disney's finest villain since Cruella De Vil, and perhaps even before, Ursula, a half-octopus half-purple-human, voiced by Pat Carroll, is darkly funny while never letting one forget that she cannot be trifled with. Ursula, like most of the great Disney villains, manages to be funny as well as intimidating by being rather aristocratic in her manner, a la Cruella, Shere Khan and Scar.Another unprecedented quality of The Little Mermaid was the presence of an excellent main character as well as an excellent villain. Ariel, voice of Jodi Benson, remains the studio's most endearing heroine. Rebellious and often foolhardy, she thinks for herself and makes mistakes--she is no passenger. She is, in fact, the catalyst for the events of the film instead of the antagonist. She is also funny and makes you want to actually listen when she speaks, which Disney had always seemed to think could never work in a main character.Even Prince Eric isn't relegated to automaton status--for a Disney movie, the central conflict seems to almost have an excess of character. A rather frustrating love interest he may be, but he is, at least, a character, and always a likable one. Kenneth Mars' King Triton is another excellent supporting character, and Buddy Hackett steals the show entirely as worldly seagull Scuttle.I need say no more than that the film is about a mermaid princess who falls in love with a human and strikes a deal with a witch for a pair of legs. The Disney version of The Little Mermaid is so different from Hans Christian Andersen's tortuously Christian parable as to be an entirely different story that happens to share some plot points with the fairy tale. Disney's version is better. I state this without compunction, and do not feel the need to list my reasons. Read the story, then watch this film, and tell me which you like better.Or don't read it. But do watch the film. It is a remarkable experience.

Although the movie-going public ignored the film at the time, Bluth's subsequent films, An American Tail and the marginally superior The Land Before Time both broke box-office records for animation and routed Disney competition.In 1989, Bluth's fourth, All Dogs Go to Heaven, was released on the same weekend as Disney's latest, The Little Mermaid, a musical in the style of the Golden Age cartoons. Bluth's new film boasted an interesting and original premise, whilst Disney's was yet another sweetened fairy tale. Bluth and his cohorts could hardly be blamed to maybe shoot for fifty million this time around, and Disney fans would have been either in denial or omniscient to expect The Little Mermaid to be other than lackluster.The Little Mermaid raked in $84,000,000. People tell you that the business a film does doesn't matter, but it does it matters a helluva lot to the films a studio makes after it. Without The Little Mermaid's extravagant success, the resurgence in American animation might never have taken place, and we have audiences' uncharacteristic discernment to thank.Above all, what is important about The Little Mermaid is what a superlative film it is. A penny saved might well be a penny earned, but a few billion pennies spent wisely can be millions and millions of dollars earned. This is The Little Mermaid's approach, and but one of many ways in which it returned to the Disney philosophy of the Thirties and Forties, when art was exalted above immediate financial gain, when no expense was spared in the pursuit of excellence, and when animation was considered a medium and not a genre, when an animated film was more than a 'kiddie movie'.Computers eased the burden on the animators and the studio's pockets, making the sort of dazzling imagery that characterized the early Disney films practical again, also enabling certain wildly impressive sequences to be brought to the screen in a manner that would have had Uncle Walt selling his multi-plane camera for scrap.And then there was the duo of Howard Ashman and Alan Menken. The pair made The Little Mermaid's score Disney's best since Dumbo, and truly animated Broadway for the first time. The songs are longer, better placed and more important to the plot than ever before, and not a dud among them. Part of Your World is the obligatory ballad, but, refreshingly, it's not a love song--even more refreshingly, The Little Mermaid doesn't really have one of those; Kiss the Girl is far too witty and entertaining to be one, and is more concerned with making out than love anyway. Poor Unfortunate Souls is deliciously wicked, and Under the Sea is pure entertainment, a showcase for Samuel E. Wright's magnificent crab, Sebastian, and a virtuoso display of animated choreography. The use of song might seem unsubtle as compared to the great animated films of the Nineties, like The Iron Giant and the Toy Story films, but it is never less than enjoyable. And by the way, it was co-producer Ashman's idea to make Sebastian a Jamaican-vizier-crab as opposed to an English-butler-crab. Masterstroke, that.Remember how scary Pinocchio was? (The movie, not the puppet.) While The Little Mermaid does not quite plumb those depths, it is bold in its occasional darkness Ursula's grisly garden and many forms, the seriousness of Ariel's situation and the despair that accompanies it, ensure that, for all its humor, the film never suffers from the childlike levity that Disney films, for time out of mind, had been trying to make adults take seriously. When it means to be funny, the film is funny; when not, not.Certainly Disney's finest villain since Cruella De Vil, and perhaps even before, Ursula, a half-octopus half-purple-human, voiced by Pat Carroll, is darkly funny while never letting one forget that she cannot be trifled with. Ursula, like most of the great Disney villains, manages to be funny as well as intimidating by being rather aristocratic in her manner, a la Cruella, Shere Khan and Scar.Another unprecedented quality of The Little Mermaid was the presence of an excellent main character as well as an excellent villain. Ariel, voice of Jodi Benson, remains the studio's most endearing heroine. Rebellious and often foolhardy, she thinks for herself and makes mistakes--she is no passenger. She is, in fact, the catalyst for the events of the film instead of the antagonist. She is also funny and makes you want to actually listen when she speaks, which Disney had always seemed to think could never work in a main character.Even Prince Eric isn't relegated to automaton status--for a Disney movie, the central conflict seems to almost have an excess of character. A rather frustrating love interest he may be, but he is, at least, a character, and always a likable one. Kenneth Mars' King Triton is another excellent supporting character, and Buddy Hackett steals the show entirely as worldly seagull Scuttle.I need say no more than that the film is about a mermaid princess who falls in love with a human and strikes a deal with a witch for a pair of legs. The Disney version of The Little Mermaid is so different from Hans Christian Andersen's tortuously Christian parable as to be an entirely different story that happens to share some plot points with the fairy tale. Disney's version is better. I state this without compunction, and do not feel the need to list my reasons. Read the story, then watch this film, and tell me which you like better.Or don't read it.

He had been making major motion pictures for several years at the time that he began the Spiderman trilogy, and has made movies even better than this (A Simple Plan seems clearly like his best work since moving into mainstream movies), but Spiderman is a surprisingly fun adaptation, coming amidst a seemingly endless barrage of disappointing comic book movies. I have to admit that I was immediately put off by Toby Maguire as the title character (and he still doesn't at all match my original impression of what kind of person the comic book Spiderman was, but his performance is so good that he embodies the character in a way that enables you to overlook the difference between what you seen and what you always imagined. This is a major obstacle to overcome, and if it's done right, you are in for a treat.New York City is captured with a brilliant reality that reminds me of great films like Do The Right Thing, but retains a sense of excess and hyper-reality, namely through some of the characters, like the loud-mouthed Jonas Jameson (played with hilarious overkill by J.K. Simmons), the editor of the newspaper Peter Parker works for.Admittedly, some of the flying through the city streets scenes are less than convincing with their total reliance on digital effects, but amazingly it doesn't look at all out of place here, probably because the only Spiderman we've known until now has been nothing but drawings. The only real complaint I would make about the movie is the costume of the villain, The Green Goblin, played with cartoonish craziness by Willen Dafoe. For all of the sheer size of the movie, it is amazing that they chose what looks like a plastic, dime-store mask for him, and a lot of the battle scenes between him and Spiderman seem genuinely contrived.Nonetheless, the movie is one of the best examples of good popcorn fun that I can think of in recent memory. It is pure, fun entertainment and even features a love story that doesn't seem forced into a movie where it doesn't belong. Kirsten Dunst gives a warm-hearted performance as the increasingly fascinated and fascinating Mary Jane, as her relationship with Peter Parker evolves but never feels predictable. The opening of the movie, where we learn what mishap created Spiderman, is wonderfully presented and lends a sense of fascination to the upcoming adventures. Sadly, the film is easy to pick apart, but overall it's just good fun. Nice work!

Korshunov thinks he has lost the president but Marshall is still on board & is determined to save his family, the other passengers & not give in to Korshunov or his demands...This American German co-production was co-produced & directed by Wolfgang Petersen & while it's not up there in the higher echelons of the big budget action film genre alongside the likes of Die Hard (1988), Terminator 2 Judgment Day (1991) or Speed (1994) for instance it's an entertaining enough big budget action spectacle with which to pass a couple of hours. The script by Andrew W. Marlowe really rams home the all American hero plot with the president of the United States turning into an action star as he single handedly takes on a bunch of terrorists, it's all very patriotic & a bit sentimental as it tries to makes all you Americans out there feel a little bit better about your foreign policies & stance on terrorism. Air Force One repeatedly states that America & it's stance is right & everyone else is wrong. However take away some of the more questionable political aspects of Air Force One & we are left we a action packed thriller with a familiar hijacking plot but plenty of fights, shoot-outs, explosions & action to pass a couple of hours with the minimum of fuss. The character's are your usual cardboard cut-outs & clichés, the dialogue is functional & the pace does drag at times but if you like big budget Hollywood action flicks then I am sure you will like Air Force One.Director Petersen does alright, there are maybe a couple of plot holes like how did known terrorist Korshunov & his men get through the fingerprint security check at the start? There's some stuff about inside help but it's never really explained to any satisfactory degree & then there's setting all those explosives off on the plane which in reality would be a really bad idea. Then there's the secret service traitor, why does he just stand by while the terrorists plans go down the toilet? Why does he not try to rectify them? Why remain anonymous? It just seems weird that he would stand by & let all the plans that he was involved with go to waste, I just don't really get it. The action scenes are well handled but a little repetitive.

The final plane to plane mid air rescue is apparently an almost shot-for-shot copy of the same type of rescue in Airport 1975 (1974).With a supposed budget of about $85,000,000 Air Force One is well made with big budget Hollywood production values, some of the CGI computer effects look a little dated these days but they still suffice. The lead role was originally written for Kevin Costner but he did The Postman (1997) instead, big mistake Kevin big mistake.

It was Luc Besson's first American film and made Jean Reno into a star in America and started off Natalie Portman's career at 12 which lead her to do films such as Heat, Star War Prequel Trilogy and Mars Attack!.Leon is a simple story, an American remake of Nikata, and follows the story of Leon, a mafia assassin. It has an action packed start, showing how good an assassin Leon was. At the same time Mathilda is a rebellious child who smoke, swore, skipped school, but also abused by her parents and sister. However she loves her brother and both Leon and Mathilda had a soft spot for each other. When Mathilda was out of the apartment building a corrupt team of DEA agents led by Gary Oldman killed her family and she goes to Leon for safety and interrupt his very private live. Leon takes the girl under his wing, tries her up to be an assassin and she starts to fall in love with Leon. It is debatable whether it was just love between a father and daughter or something more extreme. Mathilda tries to kill the DEA agents who killed her family and the film leads to a dramatic climax.As I said the film works because it is simple and it focuses on the characters. It tries to be fairly realistic and is small scale, it could have been easy to make the film more epic but it wouldn't have worked. It also a fairly low budget and Luc Besson makes full use of it. Leon has been fairly influential, showing that these sorts of films can be made with an indie spirit and has influential ideas such as the Hit-man games. Luc Besson has directed the Fifth Element after Leon, which was his last good film and become a big producer, from Unleashed to the Transporter.Leon is a good film, especially for students the world over.

Sam Raimi has never really been one of my favorite directors, but I've got to admit about how stylish he often is when it comes to making his movies. ARMY OF DARKNESS is the third film in the EVIL DEAD series, and since I haven't seen the first two yet, I'm reviewing simply this film, without making references or comparisons to its predecessors. But ARMY OF DARKNESS still does fill the void for those who might not seen the first film, therefore free from confusion.The film isn't related to its predecessors either. For, while the first two films are more of horror films (or a satire of horrors), this one is also an old-fashioned sword-and-sorcery film, complete with cheesy (intentional) dialog and swashbuckling battle scenes. The good thing about it is that Raimi takes it all less seriously, and producing a number of hilarious bits as well.Bruce Campbell reprises his role as the chainsaw-armed store clerk Ash, who is whisked into the Dark Ages, facing rival kingdoms and the army of the dead along the way. To get him back home, he must retrieve the Necronomicon, the cursed Book with the Dead, which can also prevent a small kingdom from being invaded by the Deadites. It ends up with a final confrontation against the army of Deadites when they are awakened by their lust to get the Book of the Dead back.Cheesy isn't it? But that's just the point. ARMY OF DARKNESS aims for a mockery, and it does a great job and rewards greatly. It's a lot of fun, with lots of in jokes and its own jokes, thanks greatly to the presence of Bruce Campbell, he's effectively funny. The 'low-budget' special effects are fun, and if you think they look cheesy, try saying that to the great Ray Harryhausen, which these effects pay homage to.ARMY OF DARKNESS is filled with dozens of slapstick humor and lack a number of smarter wit, but even so, it's a lot of fun and craziness. Viewers, including eventual fans of the director, will enjoy the films craziness and wit, but more on the macabre style that took to create it.

Many IMDb users voted this movie a 10, and for the life of me, I cannot see how this film remotely compares to any of the three Godfather movies (among my favorites), Gone With the Wind, Platoon, or even Scarface. If not presented in the broken, nearly reversed chronological order, there would be virtually no plot, and very thin character development.WARNING - Spoiler section....I'm not one adversely affected by violence in films, but the torture scene in Reservoir Dogs really put me off. It seemed realistic and sadistic, but I can't say that I was entertained. (I know, I probably wasn't supposed to be entertained at that point.)I had issues with a couple of the plot developments, and believe me, there were very few plot developments. First, I was rather dismayed at the idea that Harvey Keitel's character could stand against his long-time friends, Joe and Eddie Cabot, to the point of gunning them down, all while trying to protect someone he virtually did not know, and who could easily (and did) turn out to be the informer\/cop. Then, if that weren't silly enough, the undercover cop (Tim Roth's character, Mr. Orange, I believe) tells Harvey Keitel (Mr. White) that he's a cop. What could have motivated such a move? Did he want to make Mr. White feel bad for saving his life? Did he have a death wish? I think my mouth fell open trying to figure that one out. In the end, I just lumped it into the category of no plot and moved on.My last negative comment relates to the lengthy, meaningless, inane banter between the thugs around the breakfast table and in the car. It may reflect real life, but so does mowing the lawn. Neither situation is terribly fun to watch for several minutes on film.On the positive side, I thought the movie was well acted, especially by Steve Buscemi. It was certainly realistic, and the chopped, reverse chronology turned a nearly non-existent plot into a bit of a mystery. Overall, I'd rate this movie a 4 out of 10.
