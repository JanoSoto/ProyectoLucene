Sometimes, it's for their groundbreaking special effects, like the original King Kong (1933) or The War of the Worlds (1953). Sometimes it's because they have a particularly interesting character or villain like Frankenstein (1931) and The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958). And sometimes it's because they feature a creature that absolutely frightens or haunts you like Count Orlok in Nosferatu (1922). But there's only a handful of classics out there that get their recognition because of a moral message they carry. One such example is the original, Japanese version of Godzilla (1954). Another is the 1951 revolutionary classic The Day the Earth Stood Still.This memorable motion picture, recently remade with Keanu Reeves, and based on a story by Harry Bates, tells the fictional tale of an event in history when a flying saucer landed in Washington D.C. Two extra terrestrial beings emerged from its mysterious form. A humanlike messenger named Klaatu (Michael Rennie) and an eight-foot-tall, invulnerable robot called Gort (Lock Martin). These two beings arrive upon the era where mankind had began to strongly develop atomic energy and increase the violent and catastrophic potential of its warfare. The extra terrestrials arrive with a warning for all of mankind. By harnessing such horrible power and using it to create weapons, mankind was creating an intergalactic threat as well as endangering its own existence on Earth. Klaatu's warning was simple cut off the production of nuclear weapons and live in peace, or be destroyed as a threat to other worlds in the universe.Like many other popular science-fiction films, The Day the Earth Stood Still features impressive visual effects. Even the robot, Gort, which is nothing more than a man in a flexible costume, looks like a machine made from foreign-world material. The scenes where the UFO lands in Washington D.C. and where a death ray sprays into a tank and dissolves it in a flash of white light still spellbind to this day. But its more notable elements were created by the characters and by the screenwriters.The extra-terrestrial, Klaatu looks remarkably human. He doesn't have antenna, or three eyes, or tentacles, and his physical form is not a disguise. Oddly enough, this is more convincing than the present standards for aliens, which have to look like animals, particularly invertebrates, to be believable. And because he looks human, Klaatu is more relatable as a being instead of a creature. And he has morals, again, relatable and more compelling a buggy-eyed, other-planet nihilist bent on enslavement and destruction. And besides, they way I see it, if there are other beings out in the world, they wouldn't be much different than us. Physically or morally.Another noteworthy element is its symbolism, which like Godzilla (1954) stands out against nuclear war and the destruction of the environment. While it does not carry its message as vividly and horrifyingly, director Robert Wise wisely influences this message several times to keep it fresh in our minds. And while a movie cannot change the world, it is comforting to know that there were, and still are good people who realize these nightmarish elements of our world and feel compelled enough to communicate a message to us.The Day the Earth Stood Still has aged a bit since its debut in 1951, but this does in no way, take away from its influence. It has deservedly earned his place in the long list of classics from the age when true motion pictures were made instead of the standard, hackneyed projects that seem to attract audience members today in the 21st century.

Mr. Norton plays \u201CDerek\u201D a Nazi skinhead ex-convict who tries to prevent his younger brother \u201CDanny\u201D, played astutely by Edward Furlong, from going down the same path. The movie is narrated by both these protagonists as plots and sub-plots get unfolded smoothly. The plot is relatively simple but it\u2019s the natural ease with which all actors play their parts that ignites the story. Mr.Norton is absolutely convincing as the angry young man, furious at his social system and in the process gets caught up in his own ideologies.Scowling and scoffing at anyone who is non-white, Mr. Norton delivers a performance worthy of his Oscar nomination; a perfect foil to the timid \u201CNarrator\u201D of Fight club. The scene in which he grins at his brother as he gets arrested and then the shocking realization as he is dragged away from his family is a gem.The other actors including Edward Furlong have played their parts extremely well. The characters have been sketched extremely well and reflect the contemporary American society. Edward Furlong as \u201CDanny\u201D who worships his brother reminds a little of the spoiled child in T2-Judgement Day. Derek\u2019s mom, the mentor \u201CMr.Sweeny\u201D and even Mr. Norton\u2019s friend in prison, all are memorable characters that do stick in your mind. The film does have flaws. I found the movie a little short for its social undertone, but that\u2019s acceptable since the director did not want to delve too much into Derek\u2019s past. But his transition from the brutal skinhead to the redeemed prisoner is not as developed as one might expect. This is where the movie could have gained more intensity. It is not really clear why Mr. Norton lands in trouble. As a result, this sequence alone comes out half baked; a very crucial under-development to the storyline. Typical of its genre, the redeemed man is not let off the hook that easily. We know life is going to come hard on Mr. Norton. The shattering climax was expected but not surrealistic. History X suffers from falling into stereotypes so characteristic of it's genre.

But his transition from the brutal skinhead to the redeemed prisoner is not as developed as one might expect. This is where the movie could have gained more intensity. It is not really clear why Mr. Norton lands in trouble. As a result, this sequence alone comes out half baked; a very crucial under-development to the storyline. Typical of its genre, the redeemed man is not let off the hook that easily. We know life is going to come hard on Mr. Norton. The shattering climax was expected but not surrealistic.

Donald Sullivan, or Sully, is the main character of Robert Benton's Nobody's Fool. Paul Newman is certainly no fool, and he plays Sully as a grumpy old man, unimpressed by anything or anyone, short of words and emotion. However, Sully describes himself as someone who grows on people, and apparently every time he feels he's done something right, he hits the closest thing to him&#133;Twice. It's a wonderful performance by Newnan, whose character believes in luck. Well, while Frankie Dunn probably didn't, there's something that connects them both besides their human qualities (being grumpy may not be something nice, but it's still a quality), and that's the fact of living a life knowing they haven't been the best of fathers. A movie like Nobody's Fool, written and directed by someone as experienced as Robert Benton, is always going to be a winner, but it's interesting to know why. It may not be the easiest thing to develop an almost two-hour film in a small town where essentially, as it occurs in most movies of the type, nothing happens. But this statement is confusing, because a lot of things take place in Nobody's Fool, that if you look at them from a greater scale, they're still nothing.Benton takes the time and dedication to show us the lifestyle in this town, Bath, and the characters that inhabit it, more precisely the ones who are involved in Sully's life. That's how we meet his friends the stubborn Rub (that Pruitt Taylor Vince), Wirf Wirfley (Gene Saks)- Sully's one-legged lawyer-, the old lady he lives with-and loves him more than he imagines- Mrs. Beryl (Jessica Tandy's last performance); and his enemies his boss Car Roebuck (a charming Bruce Willis), who owes him a lot of money and cheats on his wife Toby (a beautiful Melanie Griffith), with whom Sally gets along well; and Raymer (a young and Great Philip Seymour Hoffman), a rookie police officer who wants to put him in jail because he doesn't pay traffic tickets and who knows what else. As Sully himself says, he's a well-known, loved man; so that's why we are surprised when he encounters his son Peter (Dylan Walsh) and they both behave like total strangers. As I mentioned, a lot of things occur in the film and various plot lines are unfold, but there is always one that has to highlight above the rest. In Nobody's Fool, that plot line is the father-son relationship, which comes with a grandson. Luckily, as it happened with Eastwood in Million Dollar Baby years later, Newman has the expertise to take enough distance and keep the movie from turning into an intense melodrama. The script throws in a couple of dramatic scenes where the wrong actor could have taken it too far. Newman also takes advantage of the few funny lines he's given and establishes a distended mood of performance that affects the film, in which you can laugh. The truth is that Benton wrote a predictable and cheesy screenplay (and Howard Shore composed a predictable and cheesy score, however pleasantly 'little town-ish'), but somehow a certain honesty prevails. Maybe it has something to do with Benton wanting to respect Richard Russo's homonymous novel, but Nobody's Fool is a winner because due to that respect we don't miss a thing and we believe and appreciate the things we see. Sully really grows on us too, and the same happens with his friends and even his enemies, who fight and steal things from each other, but at the end of the day meet at the same table, in the same bar, to play a good game of poker.

Call it a guilty pleasure.Mission Impossible is my guilty pleasure. It's based on a 1960s television series created by Bruce Geller and the movie with Tom Cruise is kind of like a mash-up between The Bourne Identity and the James Bond pictures. Basically, the standard spy movie. Tom Cruise plays a spy who is falsely accused of betrayal to his organization and finds himself working with some unlikely partners to track down the real mole in the system and expose him and clear his name. Now, this is a plot as old as the hills and Mission Impossible works with it just as well as the others. Not enormously well, but on an acceptable level.Tom Cruise is great as the film's action hero lead, unfortunately his supporting cast is quite uninteresting. Another defect worth noting is the film's convoluted plot, which sometimes is hard to follow. This is caused by a screenplay in need of revisions. That's one of the film's major weaknesses and really the reason why it's just a standard spy movie with lots of cool gadgets instead of something special.But that's really my only significant complaint about Mission Impossible.

Again, it's all been done before, sometimes better sometimes worse, but that doesn't meant it's boring or overdrawn. In fact, sometimes it's very primal.

It's almost a shame to burden it with any deeper meanings than that, as that is quite sufficient. But there are some 'messages' in it, I suppose... more on them shortly. Dustin Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey, a pain-in-the-ass actor who can't get hired anywhere because he's a pain in the ass. So he hits upon the idea of posing as a woman, Dorothy Michaels, to get hired for a soap opera. It works. Is Hoffman really so convincing impersonating a woman? No, I don't think so. But he's dead-on in his portrayal of a man pretending to be one. He's always just a little too made up and well-dressed and perfectly-coiffed to be believable next to the more natural (and real) women he interacts with, mainly Jessica Lange and Teri Garr. But aside from a stray comment here and there, nobody seems to notice. The entire cast is wonderful; I have to single out Teri Garr though. Her character, Sandy, is a very complicated and moody variation on the classic ditzy blonde and Garr is perfect in the role. Her mood can change in the blink of an eye, and it does, often.

The other virtue of Robert Wise's seminal film is that, much like most episodes of The Twilight Zone, it doesn't contain that many things to suggest otherworldly stuff is going on. What counts is the good, old, nail-biting suspense.As such, the beginning of the movie, with a spaceship landing in Washington, D.C., relies on editing and music (by none other than Bernard Herrmann, who also scored The Twilight Zone) rather than visual effects the ship lands, and doesn't move for the rest of the film. An alien emerges, but he's in human form (Michael Rennie). He has a robotic bodyguard, Gort (Lock Martin), but it doesn't do much beside guarding the ship. The important thing is Klaatu's message to the world, one that must be heard by all of mankind. Unfortunately, only a single mother (Patricia Neal) and a scientist (Sam Jaffe) are willing to listen to him without shooting first.The great thing about The Day the Earth Stood Still is it doesn't shove its message (a subtle critique on nuclear energy) in the audience's face, save for a somewhat preachy closing monologue (but hey, it was the '50s - they could get away with it) it's the moments that lead up to that point which make the movie a classic. Be it the smart and sometimes humorous dialogue, Rennie's alien performance or the fact that the film's major set-piece (Klaatu demonstrating his power) is pulled off in the simplest fashion (but a very effective one nonetheless), Wise's first sci-fi feature can boast real soul and intelligence to go with the more outlandish props (the interior of the ship especially).Plus, and this is what genre geeks tend to love the most how many serious science-fiction films, which have even be said to have religious subtexts, can brag about inspiring the funniest scene in Sam Raimi's deliriously entertaining Army of Darkness?

While its predecessor, Babe, is traditional and safe, the sequel offers more of a post-modern world-view that encapsulates various structural narrative elements, including expressionism, absurdism, futurism, and existentialism. I now wish to conduct an analysis of the piece and describe how these elements apply. I intend, however, to show how the film predominantly relies upon the expressionistic and absurdist structures. Here's why.Expressionism In a way, the film seems to mourn over the loss of spirituality. By 'spirituality,' I mean the essence of comfort and balance&#151;in a word, home. As the expressionistic structure suggests, the art we create ought to include characters that try and reclaim their homes of comfort by recognizing the world as imbalanced. Only with this recognition can we then seek and desire to reclaim balance, and thus our homes of comfort. As applied to the film, Babe's home of comfort is upset when he accidentally falls down the rabbit hole (i.e. well). Consequently, he indirectly compromises the life of his owner and severely bed-rids him. With the bank's hefty demands and the farmer's wife unable to pay the farm-land debt, she takes Babe away from his spirituality and embarks upon a mission with him into the city. Her overarching objective to reclaim enough money to sustain and preserve the farm. Babe's overarching objective to reclaim his spirituality&#151;his home. Both characters need each other to fulfill the other's objective, thus suggesting our need to serve and love others. Upon entering the big city, Babe recognizes a dramatic change in his environment. It's a strange place, and this leads us now to analyze the absurdist qualities the film possesses. Absurdism The absurdist structure seeks to purposefully defamiliarize the audience to that which they have become familiarized with. Its purpose is to help people not take life for granted, but to recognize just how truly amazing and wonderful this life is; not to forget show how profoundly strange it is too. As applied to the film, Babe becomes unfamiliar with his environment upon entering the new, strange city. There is a sense of uneasiness he feels as his lonesome eyes scan the city from a birds-eye-view looking out an open window. As he looks, the film literally begs the question within Babe's soul What kind of establishment is this? The filmmakers, too, seem to ask the audience the same question(s) in reference to earth-life. Questions like What kind of place is this? What is reality? Why are we here and where are we going? Like Babe, we are all foreign pilgrims traveling through an unfamiliar world as we desperately try and familiarize ourselves with our surroundings. Also like Babe, we are all searching for the cure to our spiritual homesickness. We find this cure by developing an expressionistic desire to restore our fallen, imbalanced lives, but only after we have recognized just how absurd our imbalanced lives really are. There are some individuals who never become enlightened to this. They are not consciously aware of life's absurdity, and so view their lives as balanced and in no need of curing. Consequently, their souls hunger on a very deep subconscious level for spiritual reconciliation because they are unable to acquire absurdist-like glasses, and therefore do not rigorously question life as something that ought to be deeply questioned. Existentialism Life for an existentialist only gains genuine and authentic meaning by one's active level of participation in the life process. The meaning that we find in life is ours to create; it's as if it floats out in the ether just waiting for us to reach out and grab&#151;but it cannot be dictated and made somehow objective by authorities\/institutions. It also is a structure that causes people to ask the why questions of life. In the film, Babe is chased down by a pack of ravenous dogs that try and violently hurt him. Upon seeing the destruction they create, Babe humbly asks, Why? This question is profoundly existential and it seems to ask the audience why we live in such a bleak and violent world filled with hateful beings. Along the same line, the film seems to presuppose that there's something wrong with the world that Babe\/we live in, and it's up to us to fix it. To fix our world, we're going to need high moral principles. The film teaches us to live with high moral principles when Babe is shown saving the life of his enemy drowning in a river. Babe Pig in the City is a wonderfully charming yet also thought-provoking tale that can entertain both child and philosopher. At its core is a sweet, ingenuous pig that possesses the type of morale that every human being ought to possess too. In this sense, the film seeks to uplift people, helping them to live as Babe does. Though it may appear that he possesses an inferior and weak personality, the filmmakers suggest that it is only those who humbly exempt themselves from the limelight who are exalted in the end. The story of Babe does just that.

While its predecessor, Babe, is traditional and safe, the sequel offers more of a post-modern world-view that encapsulates various structural narrative elements, including expressionism, absurdism, futurism, and existentialism. I now wish to conduct an analysis of the piece and describe how these elements apply. I intend, however, to show how the film predominantly relies upon the expressionistic and absurdist structures. Here's why.Expressionism In a way, the film seems to mourn over the loss of spirituality. By 'spirituality,' I mean the essence of comfort and balance&#151;in a word, home. As the expressionistic structure suggests, the art we create ought to include characters that try and reclaim their homes of comfort by recognizing the world as imbalanced.

Which in turn leads to a paralyzing self absorption or self pity that most of us don't recognize until it's too late, if at all. And that is the theme of this extraordinary film.The plot revolves around a group of middle class suburban kids a couple of years removed from high school. Jeff (Giovani Ribisi) is a college dropout who lives in his parent's garage. Tim (Nicky Katt) is a former high school football star who did a brief stint in the Air Force before chopping of part of a finger to get a disability discharge. Buff (Steve Zahn) is a stoner who's life revolves around his next buzz and his next sexual conquest. The trio whiles away their aimless lives drinking at their old high school hangout - a convenience store now run by Pakistani immigrants. In addition, there's Jeff's girlfriend Sooze (Aimee Carey), a budding artist; her friend BeeBee (Dina Spibey), a recovering alcoholic; and an old high school buddy named Pony (Jayce Bartok), now a major rock star who drops by the old stomping grounds while in town for a show. Of the group, only Pony and Sooze have any ambition in life - Pony is well on his way to achieving his dream, and Sooze is preparing to move to New York to pursue her career.Except for those two, and the convenience store owner who is studying to become an engineer, every character in the film suffers from a kind of inertia that prevents them from taking charge of their lives and achieving any meaningful success or happiness. Tim has seen the third world, but has no sympathy for its inhabitants or appreciation for how good he has it. Buff is mired in perpetual adolescence. BeeBee lives vicariously through Sooze, and, despite her own sordid history, cares little for the substance abusers she tends to as a nurse's assistant, .Then there's the liquor store clerk whose life revolves around the local high school football team, and Pony's slutty manager (Parker Posey) the rebellious poor little rich girl who went into the music business against daddy's wishes. Jeff is the one character in the film who is truly sensitive to the plight of others, but he is immobilized by his own self-pity. That is, until one night on the town with Pony when he realizes that he indeed controls his own destiny, and decides to strip away his shackles (represented by his clothes) and move to NY with Sooze. But, ironically, it's too late... Sooze hooked up with Pony while he was experiencing his revelation.At the end of the movie, the Pakistani store owner belittles Jeff and his buddies for being so stupid as to throw away all of the opportunities they are afforded by living in the greatest, most prosperous country on earth. But he, like everyone else, is blind to the desperation of those around him. Desperation that can engulf even the lives of those in the land of plenty. Thanks to the mesmerizing script by Eric Bogosian, the outstanding direction by Richard Linklater, and the performances of the stellar cast, the audience gets the message loud and clear.
