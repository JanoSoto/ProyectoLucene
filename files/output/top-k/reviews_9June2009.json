Most projectionists (like critics) are a difficult lot to please, simply through the amount of product you got to view. No film in that 30 year period 'hit' all our crew like this film did. A roaring Frankie Laine song over the opening credits falsely lead you into thinking this was going to be 'another cowboy movie', how wrong could you be? It hit us like nothing before and whilst films like Airplane & Life of Brian rose to challenge it was, and still is, the best comedy (and my favourite film) ever. You need to watch this film at least half a dozen times to get all the gags, both visual & oral (those that saw the noose around the horses neck fell out of their seat laughing - those that missed it were bemused). I must have watched it 200 times or more. The jokes are great, many stand up to this day and whilst some people simply don't get the irony or the change in scenario (e.g. Lily Von Stupp leading a Nazi singalong or the end sequence), at the time this was (and still is) hilariously brilliant. The casting was perfect, Little, Wilder, Korman, Khan, Brooks, Pickens, Deluise and a wonderful supporting cast ran with a gem of a script.

In the UK this film was a 'sleeper' which meant it started off to average audiences but once word of mouth got around the cinema was full for weeks.

This sequel (or prequel, even though this is never indicated in the film, only in the trailer) doesn't have the stigma of the original haunting it (pun completely intended), since there wasn't a best-selling book to compare it to. This certainly helps along the enjoyment of Amityville deux, although the film itself offers plenty to satisfy fans who prefer mental horror over the visceral.The subtleties here make the film, and rewatching it after several years of distance, I noted many minor elements that added new dimensions to a movie I had seen many times as a kid. The gradual change our possessee undergoes is very well realized and clips along at a natural pace, bringing about a slow-burn horror instead of a series of boo-s. The acting is very strong, and the ensemble's reactions to the happenings around them are more natural than hysterical, putting a distinct this-could-happen-to-you air on the proceedings since the characters ring true as normal people instead of horror movie archetypes. Burt Young is absolutely loathsome as the domineering father figure who rules his family with a quick-tempered fist, and his family's obvious fear of him hangs like a spectre in the air of the already-haunted abode. The dynamic between him and his soon-to-be-possessed son is perfectly essayed, and the subservience of the young man to his overbearing senior goes a long way toward explaining the weakness within him that would allow a spirit to enter and take control.While the special effects are understated, this minimalist approach serves the realism of the story, and our possessed lead's performance is so startlingly precise, he sells the demon within him even without layers of latex on his face in every scene to drive the point home. Also effective are the rare moments when we see him overcome with his own humanity, writhing in despair as the reality of his deeds overtakes him. The balance of the two, and seeing him pull the former off without complex make-up effects, really sells the realism at the core of the story.The house, itself, was the star of the original, and it doesn't lose its chilling magic upon the second visit. Perhaps it's the lore associated with the book, but the house actually looks like a place that evil spirits would run free, so simple shots of exterior windows carry an implied menace that are far more effective than the floating red eyes that served as scare tactics in the original.Of course, any review of this film would be incomplete if it didn't mention the unsettling creepiness of the incest subplot, which is unfurled in a seedy way that will test even the most acclimated horror fan. From the brother and sister duo's first scene together, they come across more as a couple than as siblings, and when this unnatural pairing is consummated, the fine acting once again steals the show. The look on sis's face when brother makes his move is a complex combination of revulsion and lust, and her nuanced countenance as she cedes to his advances conveys a string of emotions that it would take most actresses a 30-minute monologue to get across. This scene is surely the most memorable in the film, but it is so because it's played out with the malicious toying nature of a cat stalking a mouse, instead of as a look at her boobies scene.Though disturbing to watch, this subplot is given additional weight from the establishing scenes that portray these siblings as overtly flirtatious to begin with. The culmination of their sensual sparring offers the thinking viewer a great deal of context with which to further ponder the idea of possession and, indeed, evil itself. After all, since it's obvious he thought about sleeping with his sister before the big bad demon came along, did the devil really make him do it? Or did the spirit haunting him simply offer him some sort of excuse to do what he wanted to do anyway? Furthermore, what does it say about the forbidden nature of this particular act when the sister later seems to openly enjoy the scenario? Does enjoyment of sex with her brother indicate some sort of deviant evil within her, and since she's not the one possessed, does that point to an underlying theme of each of us harboring wickedness ripe for exploration? Certainly, no one in the family is truly innocent. Even the youngest children are hinted to have mischievous deeds in their past, as evidenced by Young's reaction following the incident with the paint brushes. Young himself is an aggressive alcoholic who abuses his children and wife, and his spouse allows him to do so, which fosters an environment in which these sins are accepted. Then you've got big brother boinking big sister... So, does the evil truly live within the house, or is the house merely a nexus where the evil within each of its occupants is allowed to flourish and take form? This is probably more thinking than the film-makers intended to produce (actually, I'm guessing this is definitely the case), but the cerebral response is another example of how many different levels this film works on.On the downside, the film it a bit too lengthy (like this review. Ha! Beat you to it...). The running time is about 10 minutes longer than it needs to be, and the most effective parts occur in the first act, which climaxes with the familial executions. However, this is certainly the strongest of the original trilogy of Amityville films. Writing that, I'm keenly aware that distinction is a bit like being the best film the Witchboard series, but even without the Amityville moniker, this remains an intelligent, well-realized, and well above average haunting\/possession tale.

This film is set in the thirties at first in Joliet, Illinois then as the main character Johnny Hooker tries to find his deceased friend's friend the setting changes to Chicago. Well Hooker and his friend Luther Coleman has set up a small con outside of a Joliet bank. The men don't realize that they are in fact stealing money from a mobster named Doyle Lonnegan. That money that Hooker and Luther stole was money that was being transported to Lonnegan. Therefore Lonnegan sends his men to kill Luther and Hooker. Hooker gets away, but Luther is thrown out of his window and is dead. Hooker remembers that Luther told him to find his old friend, Henry Gondroff and soon Hooker meets up with him in Chicago. In the meantime, Lonnegan's men and a cop from Joliet are looking for Hooker. So in Chicago Hooker and Gondroff plan a big con to get even with Lonnegan. Hooker wants to get revenge for Luther and follows whatever Gondroff says to do. Gondroff hires many men in order to make this con believable in the eyes of Lonnegan. Lonnegan is set up at first in a train where Gondroff acts drunk while playing cards and cheats his way into winning while Lonnegan was cheating in the same way but lost in the end. He gets very angry and even more when he realizes that he has been robbed of the money he had carrying with him. In the end Lonegan is convinced into betting on some posed races. In his last bet he had half a million dollars on the race and then lost the money. So both Gondroff and hooker stage a fight in order to get rid of Lonnegan and keep the money.I really liked the music used in this film. The music is very happy and cheerful and not once did I feel that the music was out of place in the scenes. The music had very catchy melodies that right now I find myself humming them. The ending scene was very tricky and apparently very planned. I myself found that I liked how the ending all tied up the whole story. I especially liked how one scene was so technical, it was a close-up shot of Hooker getting ready for the final stage of the big con and he put something into his mouth. Later we see what that something was supposed to be, it was red liquid that he bit in order to look more dead in the final scenes. That was a very creative way to foreshadow what was about to happen.I really didn't see the humor involved in this movie. A couple of scenes were funny but the overall movie was just humorless. I think I was too critical of the scenes but I just didn't see how certain scenes were funny. For example when Luther was lying outside his home dead, to me that was not funny at all. Maybe in the seventies (which is when this movie was made and released) this was comedy. Personally I don't laugh easily at movies so maybe this is why I wasn't laughing off of my chair during this movie.I liked both Hooker and Gondroff. They seemed to have a very good chemistry on screen. Their friendship is probably what many people would like to emulate in their own lives. Anyway overall this movie is not that bad it has a very technical way to get points across. So I would give this movie a four out of five just because I didn't find it very funny.

Anyway overall this movie is not that bad it has a very technical way to get points across. So I would give this movie a four out of five just because I didn't find it very funny.

They may not love their jobs, but they do not necessarily show it, having as much fun in one day as you could possibly imagine. Playing hockey, attending (and ruining) a funeral... and much more.This film came about after Kevin Smith was inspired by independent filmmakers of the 1980s and 1990s like Richard Linklater (particularly Slacker) and Jim Jarmusch. Before making your own movie was an easier prospect, he ran himself into debt, took a risk, and it paid off big. He may not have the talent of Linklater or Jarmusch, and will probably never have a film in the Criterion Collection, but he brings i nthe box office dollars.I do not know what to say here. My favorite film of all time is Mallrats, which would not exist if it were not for Kevin Smith's success with Clerks. Now, I love Clerks and have long found it to be one of the funniest films out there with numerous insights into life. Though, now I am not so sure. Having watched it again a few days ago, it seemed much less funny to me and the crude acting really stood out, as well as the questionable shaky camera and overall juvenile tone.This is not to say that Clerks will not go down in history as an important film, but I am starting to think that it will lose its timeless nature if it has not already. In many ways, it is a time capsule of the mid-1990s, for better or worse. Kevin Smith as a whole is waning, it seems, with more failures than hits these days... and once he fades into the background, his films will not be far behind. I cannot fault the man for what he has done... but almost wonder if he was better off making his mark and walking away.One of the more interesting things about this film, in hindsight of twenty years (as of November 2014) is whose career took off and whose did not based on this film. Kevin Smith obviously became huge, and took with him his crew of Scott Mosier and David Klein. Jason Mewes, of the actors, has probably been the most successful. Brian O'Halloran has done alright, and Jeff Anderson has a career more or less completely reliant on Smith. Perhaps the strangest thing is that Lisa Spoonauer, by far the most photogenic of the Clerks alumni, more or less never acted again.If you have not seen Clerks, see it. Especially if you are younger, and can appreciate what it is like working in a thankless dead-end job. You may wish to follow it up with Clerks 2, though that film is vastly inferior. Go for Mallrats or Chasing Amy.

The plot is tight, logical and constantly surprises you (compare to the plot problems in Terminator Salvation). T2 can even be seen before all others as I did many years ago as it stands by itself. The cinematography and camera shots are beautiful. Notice the color schemes particularly in the asylum (blue-gray) and the foundry (orange-red). The visions scenes are very inspired and memorable. The action is intense, engrossing and escalating as it should be. The visual effects are very impressive and were revolutionary back then, especially anything involving the T-1000. The actors are top-notch particularly Linda Hamilton who shines in the strong yet fragile, tough yet conflicted Sarah Connor, the role of her life.The terminators, supposed to be unemotional, are quite cool, menacing and relentless yet fascinating. The interactions between John Connor and the terminator are wonderful and add depth to both characters. After seeing T2 for the first time, I was so awed by Robert Patrick's performance that I kept looking for him in other movies. Everything is in the physicality and the deliberate movements with no small nod to the talents of the director. Compare the T-1000 to the terminatrix in T3 who for some reason was much less memorable. The music is much better and grandiose than the first (such a good percussive theme) and the sound effects are so good they won 2 academy awards. Let's finish by mentioning the powerful unforgettable ending that is not only moving but ties up neatly the loose ends. There's actually something big that does not make sense (darn time travel paradoxes) but even after seeing T2 more than once, it just doesn't bug you when you actually watch the film. It's definitely worth buying but be careful with the different DVD editions.

Born of Hugh Hefner's Playboy philosophy of the 1950s -- how to choose an expensive pipe, the most stylish watches, the sveltest babes -- it seems monstrously dated, eclipsed by its own imitators, all the action-by-the-numbers movies of the 1980s. It's descendants offered more gore and violence, though the wisecracks and double entendres remain at about the same level.Roger Moore as James Bond, to a beautiful young woman I see you've been in the saddle. Woman Yes, I like a good morning ride. Bond I'm an early riser myself. They all must be really expensive and, with a few exceptions, they're hard to differentiate. Oh, some star Sean Connery, some Roger Moore, and some Pearse Brosnan -- but what's the difference really? Some of the difference is in the kinds of chases, in the sense of what kind of vehicle is pursuing what other kind of vehicle. I can't remember them all, but I do recall half a dozen speedboats in the coves of Florida. This one features Moore in the driver's seat of an out-of-control fire engine pursued by the Keystone Cops, bouncing over the streets of San Francisco. (See Bullit for the original.) Then there are the glamorous women themselves. This one features Tanya Roberts as Bond's good companion. Grace Jones is the villainess, and she's startling. Her body is that of a sinewy leptosome, and her physiognomy and even her hair style are suggestive of a Tutsi warrior. Her eyes seem unable to simply look at something. They glare. And her teeth, generally exposed, are always clenched. She can't act but neither can good girl Tanya Roberts so it evens out.Yes -- the story. Moore, as Bond, foils a plot by a mad man (Christopher Walken) to blow up the reservoirs above the San Andreas fault and flood silicon valley, cornering the market for computer chips.Aside from some nicely choreographed action scenes, Walken may be the best thing about the movie. I can only think of one film in which he's given a performance so poor that it becomes ludicrous -- something to do with Anne Heche being gang banged by the police. One of the most hilarious scenes in any movie ever made HAS to be Walken's brief appearance in Pulp Fiction, a story delivered dead pan, a sentimental tale, about Walken's being a prisoner of war in Vietnam and walking around with another man's watch in his anus.I keep waiting for the series to develop Cheyne-Stokes breathing, shudder, gasp that it was once a big shot, and expire, but it never does. The last two entries feature Daniel Craig as a serious Bond, an attempt to resuscitate, I suppose.Will there be another remake? Does a bear sit in the Vatican?
