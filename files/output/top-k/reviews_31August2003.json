I suspect it's partly a christian-thing given the theme and all.  Not being raised christian it doesn't connect with me.  But regardless, the movie has several problemsFirst, every scene is twice as long as it needs to be.  Also include many formulaic scenes when I the moviegoer was supposed to go ooh ahh in wonderment, but instead I was so bored.  This film could have been 1.5 hours long with no loss of content.  Tom Hank's closing line is even something like the green mile can seem awfully long.  Oh the irony.Second, the writers give the characters a handicap of being incapable of communicating -- JC rambles about helping people when he could simply say hey look I have special powers allow me to demonstrate.  If I were in charge of sentencing, I could see myself putting him on death row too -- it is so frustrating.  The same frustration comes from the buildup to the scene with the warden's wife -- if Tom Hanks only lucidly told the warden what's up, they could've done the job in 5 minutes without any fuss.  Instead, they were cryptic and turned it into a 45 minute production.  What a waste of time.Third, the philosophy of the movie just doesn't seem right.  The prison guards all have super-cushy jobs.  Compare to the characters in Saving Private Ryan.  Which extreme commands more respect?  I don't see building heroes out of prison guards.  Similarly, the main character JC is wallows in self-pity.  Rather than be so depressed about the evil in the world, he needs to swallow it and go out and do something with his life.  Take valium if you have to.  If you're in trouble with the US government, flee to Yemen.These problems were on my mind every minute of the film.  Most likely you won't be bothered by them, given the ratings.  But to be safe, in case you watch The Green Mile and after 1\/2 an hour you don't like it, turn it off you won't like the next 2 1\/2 hours either.

For those kinds of films, it makes no difference what is their literary legacy because they presuppose no antecedent, unlike a sequel or a film based upon a tv series.  The Claim begins with the brownish look of some of the earlier Clint Eastwood westerns and seems to almost attempt to emulate some of that feeling. Naming a town, Kingdom Come, almost immediately brings to mind Pale Rider with The Claim lacking the austerity of that film.  No one can fault the backdrop of this movie - the Sierra Nevada's.  There is hope that this will be more than a decent film with an adequate budget and good actors because it is associated with the BBC.  It certainly has a look to it that strives for authenticity.  So how does it turn out?The British underpinning of this movie can either take one of two forms tally ho and away we go or the stiff British lip that one finds in sound bites from its parliament with those here, here.  Well, the 'here, here gets the nod here.  Even with its nudity, the film is too conservative, indicating a misunderstanding of the feel of the old American west.  Whoever wrote the script should have studied the early Clint Eastwood movies (such as The Outlaw Josey Wales) more thoroughly.  It is just too genteel and lacks rawness.  Nastassja Kinski receives third billing in this film.  Her role is the glue that holds this movie together.  Very early on, for those looking for her, she is seen in 1\/8th profile for less than a second and then holding on for dear life as an open ended wagon bounces along the dirt road with her and her daughter in the back.  At best, this role is two dimensional and clearly lacks depth because none was called for in the portrayal of a dying woman.  As soon as she is shown coughing up blood, it is obviously curtains for her with the hope that she can make something out of the role like Clint Eastwood in Honkytonk Man - she can't.  She does what she has to with a convincing cough.  The other actors, with more defined and difficult roles, are simply not up to the task to pull them off in a convincing manner.  They fail to rise to the occasion.  Wes Bentley, as Dalglish, is not credible.  He would appear to be more comfortable waiting on tables in between acting jobs at Campanile, a restaurant in Los Angeles.  He doesn't appear to possess the mental grit to cold heartedly kill someone, much less spearhead the laying out of a railroad in the wild west.  Milla Jovovich as Lucia is passable.  There is no electricity in her performance even with her prosthetic gold tooth.  Peter Mullan as Daniel Dillon is way too conservative.  The role calls for more emotional espression or at least the hint of it.  Sarah Polley being a young actress of 20 or so at the time, must have been thrilled to get the role and isn't pushed very hard on the performance scale.  The Claim is a movie that is very much like a full cup of water in its beginning, but by the end of the movie one realizes that there is a hole at the bottom of the cup because everything has dribbled away.

Serendipity throws every known romantic comedy cliche at the audience with dizzying speed, finally concluding with the unavoidable happy kissing scene.  This movie is intended for hopeless romantics (like the woman who dragged me to it) who will happily sit through an hour and a half of pointless nonsense for the happy kissing scene at the end.  And did I mention the happy kissing scene?  The trailer had an intriguingly romantic premise--two people supposedly destined by fate to be together--which could have been made into an intriguing romantic movie.  Looking back, I can see that this high concept was merely intended to lure hopeless romantics into the movie.  Instead of living up the promise of this idea, Serendipity turned out to be just another cookie-cutter romantic comedy, and then some. The biggest, largest, hugest mistake the movie made was to make Cusack and Beckinsale engaged to supporting characters.  The movie would have been much, much more palatable if they had been lonely and searching.  The central part of the movie involves Cusack and Beckinsale walking, driving, and flying around in a desperate race against time to find each other before they have to get married to somebody else.  This race against time is ultimately meaningless, because Cusack jilts his girlfriend at the altar--off screen!  Cusack's girlfriend and Beckinsale's boyfriend simply disappear from the movie!  They must have been heartbroken, but since they are the obligatory supporting characters who have to be discarded so that the romantic leads can get together, their feelings don't matter and the audience shouldn't be burdened with them.  It's an outrageous cheat on the part of the writers.  And by the time Cusack finds the copy of Love in the Time of Cholera with Beckinsale's name and phone number in it, and Beckinsale finds the five-dollar bill with Cusack's name and phone number on it, they have already spent half the movie trying to find each other, so what's the point?  At the end of the movie, after Cusack lies down on a skating rink and lets snowflakes fall into his mouth in a scene with no apparent purpose except to showcase his cuteness, Beckinsale finds him, they tell each other their names to be sure they have the right person, and then they immediately start kissing, even though they spent only one evening together five years ago.  After all, now that they've found each other, there's no point in continuing the movie; the requirements of the formula have been satisfied.

The Special Edition DVD is the perfect way to preserve Ron Shelton's funny, sexy, passionate, action-filled baseball masterpiece.Movies aimed at grown-ups are a rarity, which may be why Bull Durham still feels like such an amazing movie. Not a moment of it is aimed toward the lowest common denominator. There is sex in this movie, and talk of sex, but it's not silly or gutter-minded, and never gross. You can feel the physical and emotional passion of the characters; baseball simply provides the philosophical backdrop behind the romance -- the reason the characters are together.Kevin Costner and Susan Sarandon make my favorite romantic screen couple; they burn up the screen. Costner in particular is excellent, showing a knack for verbal comedy and physical heroism that he put on a shelf until Tin Cup. And Tim Robbins turns in a memorable performance as Nuke Laloosh.I see no reason in going into the plot details, as everyone who has seen the film knows what Bull Durham is about, and those who haven't seen it are in for a wonderful treat. Few movies approach perfection, but this one, set in a world of lovable losers where the game is just as much a job as selling appliances at Sears, joins that select handful.

Not a moment of it is aimed toward the lowest common denominator. There is sex in this movie, and talk of sex, but it's not silly or gutter-minded, and never gross. You can feel the physical and emotional passion of the characters; baseball simply provides the philosophical backdrop behind the romance -- the reason the characters are together.Kevin Costner and Susan Sarandon make my favorite romantic screen couple; they burn up the screen. Costner in particular is excellent, showing a knack for verbal comedy and physical heroism that he put on a shelf until Tin Cup. And Tim Robbins turns in a memorable performance as Nuke Laloosh.I see no reason in going into the plot details, as everyone who has seen the film knows what Bull Durham is about, and those who haven't seen it are in for a wonderful treat. Few movies approach perfection, but this one, set in a world of lovable losers where the game is just as much a job as selling appliances at Sears, joins that select handful.

This movie is simply hilarious.  David Spade plays Joe Dirt with heartwarming flare.  And with supporting actors like Christopher Walken (who's always genious) and Kid Rock (in the ONLY role he was born to play) the movie weaves together great characters and situations into a story that will leave you feeling that Life's a Garden.
