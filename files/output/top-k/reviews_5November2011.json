[{"date":"5 November 2011","score":"","review":" MPAA rating for this film is lousy and way off base, as usual. But hey what do you expect from a bunch of 40 to 60yo, when this should be reviewed by 25 to 35yo.s I would have ratted this film somewhere between PG13, and R. Get real people, the stuff depicted in this film is actually much cleaner than anything you would see in a sex ed video in jr. high. Plus kids are much more aware of gays and lesbians in society than most people think, and they should be educated about same sex unions in the same class on opposite sex unions, it just makes sense. I would highly recommend this film to anyone. the frivolity of it all is very nice simple and straight forward. two thumbs way up. Now we just need a film about transsexuality for jr high school kids and we will be all set.
