So far, nothing's worked and this movie is a good example of this. The story is the beautiful princess, Odette, is kidnapped by a powerful sorcerer (a plot we have seen dozens of other times), but here is the twist. The bad guy puts a spell on her, making it so that she will always be a swan, unless she is on the lake when the moon's light is shining on it. Now, let me introduce the 'prince charming' of the story. Derek is the prince of another kingdom who blows the two kingdoms chances of being allies when he says the wrong words to their princess, but he is still in deep love for her and is looking for the creature known as the Great Animal, who kills Odette's father. While Derek is searching for the identity of the Great Animal, Odette, as a swan, meets three characters definitely meant for small children. You have Jean Bob, the frog who thinks he is a prince, Speed, a turtle that sounds and feels way too close to Winnie the Pooh's Eeyore, and General Puffin, a puffin bird.After the opening song This is my Idea which was the closest the movie got to being anywhere as good as Disney's orchestra, the movie seems to fall apart. Jean Bob has the fakest French accent I have ever heard and he is just annoying, rather than funny. Speed? Probably the only decent character in the story. General Puffin? It seems like he is just showing off for Odette, knowing she is a princess, and the methods of helping her just become too childish and too immature for any audience to really care for the story.The Swan Princess is stuffed with songs, all of which sounds either horrible, or just plain idiotic, like the sorcerer's song No More Mr. Nice Guy and Princesses on Parade. Every song makes you wonder why they put in the song, and after hearing 3 of these pathetic tunes, you just want to go and spend your day elsewhere.The story is also packed full of clichés. It would have been easy to simply avoid these, but for some reason, the director couldn't. The whole princess being kidnapped, and prince rushing to save her sounds like a dozen of Disney's movies, and the characters in the Swan Princess aren't any different. You have innocent, little Odette who has a terrible curse on her (*cough* Sleeping Beauty *cough**cough*), the fair, defeats-all prince, and the three child-friendly characters. Also, here's a surprise! Well, not really. The bad guy is actually the Great Animal!? What other movies have villains that change into awesome creatures? Aladdin, Sleeping Beauty, and probably many more other movies that I am too tired to think of right now. And what a surprise also. The 'Great' powerful Animal is killed in ONE HIT! Again, WAAAY over-used.If you are looking for a decent family movie for kids to leave you alone until half way through, this could be that movie. But if you have a chair that has a leg that is smaller than the others, The Swan Princess is definitely more efficient than some cardboard. Honestly, The Swan Princess is a movie that feels far too much like a would-be Disney clone and has too many clichés for me to actually recommend it.

Were there ever two film stars easier to look at than Grant and Hepburn, who epitomized elegance, glamour and sophistication over two generations? Despite their 25 year age difference, their on-screen chemistry is like watching cotton candy being spun out of the air. You know what's wrong with you? a querulous Hepburn demands of Grant after a trying evening out. No, what? out-of-sorts Grant replies. Hepburn leans over to him with her liquid doe eyes and dreamily intones, Nothing. That triple entendre, meltingly spoken by Hepburn, delights as a moment of cinematic perfection. Another is Walter Matthau's impeccable comic timing as he corrects Hepburn's mistakenly calling the CIA the CIO. It's worth waiting for.But the stars, gorgeous and witty as they are (check out Hepburn's hilarious final line of the film) are not the only element that makes CHARADE sparkle. The script shines as much as the acting and the direction. The film is unashamedly full of Hitchcock touches (why apologize for borrowing from the best?) yet never feels derivative. The clever original story by Peter Stone and Marc Behm, and fine pacing by director Stanley Donen keeps the audience guessing through the many twists and turns that lead to Hepburn's climactic discovery of Grant's true identity--the charade of the title.My only quibble would be the shower scene--perhaps taking the borrowings from Hitchcock into parody. It feels unnecessary and slows down the story. Seeing Cary Grant embarrass himself in this way with his effeminate gestures as he washes in his drip-dry suit jars the viewer temporarily right out of the picture. And the trio of heavies that dominate the first 2\/3rds of the film, played by James Coburn, Ned Glass, and George Kennedy, seem to be working too hard to be frightening when no one seems particularly scared of them. Hepburn's panic only begins to register when she confronts Grant at the end. Hepburn saved her intense terror for WAIT UNTIL DARK five years later, so why not let these villains lighten up a little and get into the spirit of the fun? These are minor distractions. With its effervescent score by Henry Mancini, gorgeous wardrobe by Givenchy for Miss Hepburn, and shimmering photography in Paris and Swiss locations by Charles B. Lang, CHARADE is the assured work of old pros, supremely confident movie makers who set out to entertain and did so while barely missing a beat. Even The Master himself was charmed. Hitchcock wanted Grant and Hepburn for the lead roles in THE BIRDS.
