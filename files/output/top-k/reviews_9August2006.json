Baxter is a junior clerk with a giant New York insurance corporation who has found an unusual way to get on. He is the tenant of a small apartment which he allows senior executives of the firm to use for sexual assignments with their mistresses. He does this not in exchange for money but on the understanding that the managers involved will use their influence to advance his career. As a result Baxter quickly finds himself promoted from his lowly position to that of a junior executive with his own office and a key to the executive washroom. Complications arise, however, when Baxter falls in love with Fran Kubelik, the elevator girl who just happens to be the mistress of Jeff Sheldrake, the head of the company's personnel department, who has often taken Fran and his other mistresses back to Baxter's apartment. This film is in the tradition of the sophisticated comedies centred upon adultery and divorce which were considered very daring and risqu√© in the forties and fifties. Director Billy Wilder had made another film of this type, The Seven Year Itch, several years earlier. The difference between that film and The Apartment perhaps reflects the growth in permissiveness which took place between the mid-fifties and the early sixties, The Apartment being considerably bolder in its treatment of sexual themes. In The Seven Year Itch, Marilyn Monroe's character is the object of the fantasies of the married man who lives below her, but nothing ever takes place between them. In The Apartment, however, although there are no bedroom scenes, we are given to understand that adulterous sex takes place in Baxter's apartment on a regular basis (to the horror of his neighbour, a Jewish doctor, who mistakenly believes that Baxter himself is the lover of all these different women). Moreover, the film is a romantic comedy which has as its heroine a woman who is conducting an affair with a married man, something that would have been unthinkable a few years previously. In this respect The Apartment can be seen as looking forward to the fully-fledged sex comedies of the late sixties and seventies and to modern rom-coms in which it is no longer necessary that the characters be chaste and virginal. It was also one of the first films to deal with sexual harassment in the workplace, something that has become a staple theme of modern office-based films. In other respects, however, it is rather old-fashioned. In a seventies sex comedy Baxter would probably have been presented as an attractive jack-the-lad whose pursuit of self-interest is wholly admirable, Fran as a go-getter happy to sleep with her boss all the time she thinks she is in with a chance of becoming the second Mrs Sheldrake but equally happy to throw him over when she realises he is not serious about her, and Sheldrake himself as a groovy swinger. The Apartment takes a more moralistic line. Baxter may not be the drunken womaniser that Dr Dreyfuss imagines him to be, but the film condemns his conniving at the sexual immorality of others for the sake of his own self-advancement. Fran is hopelessly in love with Sheldrake, even after she discovers how insincere and selfish he is. At times the comedy becomes much blacker than the average romantic comedy; Fran's suicide attempt shows how dangerous and destructive the casual philandering of a man like Sheldrake can be. Another difference between this film and the more traditional romantic comedy is that the humour is often very satirical in nature. Most of the satire is at the expense of American big business- the impersonality of big corporations (Baxter proudly announces that his firm employs more people than the total population of Natchez, Mississippi), the culture of corporate philandering, the bullying of junior staff by senior management, the snobbery of the top brass. Combined with the satire is a more serious study in character development, of how Fran overcomes her hopeless infatuation with Sheldrake and how Baxter becomes (in Dreyfuss's words) a Mensch by learning that his love for Fran is of more import than his selfish pursuit of success by dubious means and that there are more important things in life than who gets the key to the executive washroom. (The word Mensch is German for human being; its use in this film, and the character of Dreyfuss himself, possibly reflect Billy Wilder's own German-Jewish roots). The script is often witty and Jack Lemmon as Baxter shows just why he was regarded as being among the best comedy actors of the period. (At times, as in Days of Wine and Roses, he got the chance to show that he could be a very good actor in serious dramas as well). Nevertheless, I am surprised that the film won the best picture Oscar ahead of not only Elmer Gantry but also Spartacus and Psycho, neither of which were even nominated. It is overlong, and the character of Fran seems problematic for a modern audience. Shirley MacLaine does her best to portray her as a feisty, independent woman, but this portrayal sometimes seems at odds with the way the character is written. The fact that she remains hopelessly devoted to Sheldrake even after it becomes clear to her what a scoundrel he is can make her seem weak and passive. Perhaps the audiences of the early sixties would only accept as a romantic heroine a woman involved in an adulterous affair if it was made clear that she was truly in love with him. This is an entertaining film, which has dated better than The Seven Year Itch, but I would not rate it as highly as Wilder's other great comedy from this period, Some Like It Hot. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 August 2006","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" C.C.

Despite a few alterations to the over all story, such as the Risqu√© Bettie Page character from the comics being replaced with the much more repectable girl next door Jenny Blake, the film very rarely strayed for the main ideas presented in the comic book.The film was pitched to audiences as Indianna Jones meets Top Gun, but in fact the Rocketeer was actually an update and homage to the popular 1950's pulp movie serial Commando Cody.The film was released in June, 1991, and grossed just under $50,000.00 in the US despite some very positive critical buzz. The film was one of Disney's major financial flops and quickly slipped into obscurity.However as with many films of this genre the movie has built up a cult following both stateside and in Japan, were even to this day a major toy manufacturer (Medicom) continues to produce 12 action figures and replica helmets based on the film.The films cult status is well deserved, and is one of the most under-rated action films of the 1990's. The script, the actors and even the action were all top notch and exuded a sense of charm that has been somewhat lacking in the last decades barrage of summer popcorn flicks. There was a true sense of that old Gee Whiz feeling that was so key to the serial films of the 30's 40's and 50's. Billy Campbell, who like the film has slide into a level obscurity, fully embodied the all American fly boy image that America was trying to establish at the time. Billy was able to walk that same fine line between awkward geek and hero that Christopher Reeves did in Superman. Alan Arkin made the fatherly role of mechanic Peevey his own. Jennifer Connoly struck the perfect chord as the girlfriend who feels distanced and shut out from her boyfrieds life and is always on the defensive regarding her career choice to be an actress.This is also one of the most memorable roles for Timothy Dalton whose much maligned jaunt as James Bond never allowed him to show the kind of acting range he displays here. As a villain Dalton was spot on.Yes there are clich√©s, Nazi's once again are the villains. Yes there are mechanics in the film that are questionable, the Rocket pack shoots out flames that should set Cliff Secords pants on fire. But it's all very tongue in cheek and if you can see past the few flaws then the film is one hell of a ride.This is also one of the last big budget films to use practical effects. The film was released in the same month and year as Terminator 2 which used heavy CGI to accomplish many of its action scenes and is considered by many to have begun the CG revolution. There are directors such as Jon Favreau that have argued for a return to practical effects due to the over saturation of computer Graphics in modern sci fi and action films, and looking at the Rocketeer it's easy to understand why some directors are beginning to rebel against the use of CG. The effects in the Rocketeer have a certain charm and magic that would have been lost with the cold and sterile feel that computer renders tend to exhibit in these kind of films.

The film was one of Disney's major financial flops and quickly slipped into obscurity.However as with many films of this genre the movie has built up a cult following both stateside and in Japan, were even to this day a major toy manufacturer (Medicom) continues to produce 12 action figures and replica helmets based on the film.The films cult status is well deserved, and is one of the most under-rated action films of the 1990's. The script, the actors and even the action were all top notch and exuded a sense of charm that has been somewhat lacking in the last decades barrage of summer popcorn flicks. There was a true sense of that old Gee Whiz feeling that was so key to the serial films of the 30's 40's and 50's. Billy Campbell, who like the film has slide into a level obscurity, fully embodied the all American fly boy image that America was trying to establish at the time. Billy was able to walk that same fine line between awkward geek and hero that Christopher Reeves did in Superman. Alan Arkin made the fatherly role of mechanic Peevey his own. Jennifer Connoly struck the perfect chord as the girlfriend who feels distanced and shut out from her boyfrieds life and is always on the defensive regarding her career choice to be an actress.This is also one of the most memorable roles for Timothy Dalton whose much maligned jaunt as James Bond never allowed him to show the kind of acting range he displays here. As a villain Dalton was spot on.Yes there are clich√©s, Nazi's once again are the villains. Yes there are mechanics in the film that are questionable, the Rocket pack shoots out flames that should set Cliff Secords pants on fire. But it's all very tongue in cheek and if you can see past the few flaws then the film is one hell of a ride.This is also one of the last big budget films to use practical effects. The film was released in the same month and year as Terminator 2 which used heavy CGI to accomplish many of its action scenes and is considered by many to have begun the CG revolution. There are directors such as Jon Favreau that have argued for a return to practical effects due to the over saturation of computer Graphics in modern sci fi and action films, and looking at the Rocketeer it's easy to understand why some directors are beginning to rebel against the use of CG. The effects in the Rocketeer have a certain charm and magic that would have been lost with the cold and sterile feel that computer renders tend to exhibit in these kind of films.
