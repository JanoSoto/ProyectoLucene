Out trying (and mostly failing) to shoot rabbits, Captain Albert Wiles stumbles over Harry's dead body lying with gunshot wound to the head. He decides to hide the body but before he can move it others have already stumbled over the body but have taken a surprisingly uninterested approach to it. As he waits for his time, Captain is discovered by local artist Sam Marlowe, who offers to help cover it up. When they work out who he was, they also find that there are a couple more people in the village who think they are responsible for the murder.One of the missing Hitchcocks this is, in my opinion, the least of the five films although it is still interesting and amusing to a point. The interesting setup could have been used to much better effect although Hitchcock does enjoy the contrast of murder set against the rather nonplussed residents of New England. The film's score underlines this approach by being constantly upbeat and flying in the face of the macabre events on screen. The narrative does take some time to get going and spends far too long with Sam Marlowe early on but when it gets up a bit of energy by the middle stages it is a bit more fun. The problem is that other than being fairly amusing it isn't actually that interesting a story all told. The spirit of restraint that is inherent in the characters and place cannot help but slow and rather damage the film to a degree. I know some people shudder to criticise Hitchcock but he cannot bring enough pace or humour to the film to make it as good as his other impressive films.What he does do very well is direct although it helps that the cinematography is so lush; the rich New England reds and golds work well with the subject of death in the air. His direction of the cast is misjudged though and most of the performances are pretty poor. I don't want to be unkind to the cast but for some of them I felt that Harry himself was more natural and convincing than some of them. Forsythe is the leading man but he isn't that good and is rather dominated by a so-so but enjoyable turn from Gwenn. MacLaine is pretty lively in her debut performance but Marfield couldn't have been more wooden if he had been provided by IKEA. Dunnock and Natwick are reasonable. The restrained air that they produce does work to generate some nice moments of humour but I felt it also held them and the film back from doing more and I didn't think it worked that well.Worth seeing for Hitchcock fans then but perhaps not strong enough for a wider audience and surely I can't be the only one that viewed the conclusion as just one big weak cop-out?

The guy who Argento taught everything he knows too. In 1994 Soavi directed Dellamorte Dellamore (Cemetery Man) yet another entry into the horror genre. But this wasn't your standard zombie gore fest. This movie had a little more going for it, what was it? Oh yeah, some freaking originality! Story is about this guy named Francesco Dellamorte who works as a caretaker at the local cemetery. There, day in and day out he is in charge of burying the dead and sending them of to the afterlife. Only problem is that in this cemetery the dead rise after seven days of being dead! Soon Francesco finds himself knee deep in zombies! Weird thing is he treats everything very matter of factly and just kills the zombies and continues with his life. That is until he meets an extremely gorgeous woman in a burial. He immediately falls for her. It seems Francescos life will not only revolve around death this time because apparently love is just around the corner for this grave digger.One of the things I admire most about this movie is its atmosphere. The location where they chose to shoot the film was fantastic and beautiful. And the few scenes that were shot on the real cemetery add a level of reality to the proceedings, this wasn't an obvious set. This cemetery looked real, filled with real graves and awesome Gothic statues. Rupert Everett is a real asset to this film. I cannot imagine anyone else playing Francesco Dellamorte, its his role and no one elses. He dominates the screen as a guy who has gotten so used to living amongst the dead, that he actually prefers it. He prefers living amongst the dead and the undead, for they don't pester him as much as live humans do. I also dug Francois Hadji as Gnagi, Francescos assistant and best friend. He is a cartoon of a character, sometimes retarded, sometimes funny and most of the time just gross to look at. Then there's Anna Falchi as she. The girl of Francescos dreams. And to be quite honest I don't blame him. This girl is hotter then Georgia Asphalt! She is the girl grieving over her husbands recent death, and soon she becomes the object of Francescos affections. Man, this movie has some steamy sex scenes! Lots of boob and ass shots here for both the girls and guys and from the guys side Ill say this You wont be disappointed! Of course the movie (I'm sad to say) does have a few flaws here and there. Technical difficulties were present for example, there's a scene in which Francescos making out with the girl on top of a grave and some ghostly lights appear next to them. They are little balls of blue flame floating around, now this is a very cool idea that I loved immensely, but I was so distracted by the fact that you could see the strings that were holding the little light balls up in the air. I really hated that and wished they'd taken a little extra care so that those strings wouldn't show up on screen. Same thing goes for a scene in which a fly is hovering above a corpse. The strings holding the fake fly were obviously visible through out the whole thing. But thats about as far as I go when it comes to faults on this movie. The zombies were excellent looking and very different here. The gore was great too and not as plentiful as one might expect from an Italian horror production, but it was there.The movie also has a pretty big fault because it doesn't do a good job of explaining certain plot points. This is extremely common place in Italian horror films and it happens yet again on this film. At certain point in the film you feel like something is not quite right, and according to what I've read of the movie certain things are happening, but it isn't explained in a matter that one would understand. I only became aware of certain plot points after having read explanations about the plot. But I can honestly tell you that from your first watch, you might not catch certain things that are happening. In a way I liked the fact that I didn't fully understand every single little detail, but I'm sure that if the movie had done a better job of explaining certain things it would have been that much cooler. Still, its like a little puzzle that you'll have to figure out if you really want to. Let me put it this way, you can watch the film and take the story exactly for what is happening literally, but when you read about what was really happening in the film you gooooooh I see! And then you get all the little hints that the movie gives you all through out.So in conclusion, Dellamorte Dellamore is a fantastic film from Michele Soavi. I only wish he would make more horror movies. Sadly it seems he has retired from directing straight horror films. Still, Dellamorte Dellamore is his crowning achievement and shouldn't be missed by horror fans just because its a foreign film. Its a movie that talks a lot about death and love as the title so appropriately suggests. This film has many original ideas not seen on other horror films before, its artsy, its surrealistic and dreamlike, its beautiful to look at. In short, I freaking loved it!

Nicole is your average teenager, and she lives with her architect dad, stepmom, and little brother in her father's custom-designed, secure home. While going clubbing one night with her friend Margo (Alyssa Milano), she meets David (Mark Wahlberg), who seems like a charming young man. She and David begin to form a relationship, despite her father's instinct that David is a dangerous guy. But David's true colors show after he beats up one of Nicole's male friends for giving her a friendly hug. As Nicole tries to distance herself from David, he keeps coming back, obsessed and determined to get her back. Nicole relapses for him again, but she finally decides to break it off after she sees him being abusive to Margo at his home, where he lives with a bunch of lowlife thugs. But David will have Nicole, and nothing less - even if it means killing her family and friends.All around, Fear is a pretty predictable movie. While it may be predictable, it is also quite entertaining and held my attention the entire way through. Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon did well in the film, especially since this is some of her much earlier work. Wahlberg was menacing as David, besides some of his angry facial expressions coming off as a little corny. The chemistry between the two worked well though. I found the story to be halfway decent, even though these romantic thriller revenge stories have been done before. The finale house-attack was great, it was definitely the best part of the whole movie. If you're a horror fan, this movie may be a little slow for you. It is mostly dramatic and slightly romantic through the first half, then David's true character is really established. Throughout the film the violence is kept to a minimum, but the ending sequence is actually quite gory. The only problem with the finale is there is one major plot hole - nobody has a mobile phone! It was 1996 and this is a rather wealthy family, you can't tell me they don't own cell phones! Other than that though, I thought the ending was really well done.Overall, Fear is a decent thriller. The story was interesting (if not a little bit predictable at times) and the acting was decent. For hardcore horror fans, this may be a little bit slow, but the ending made it worth it, for me at least. Not bad for the type of movie it is, quite entertaining. 7\/10.

Tom Cruise plays an eccentric guy who is so full of himself that even those closest to him don't really matter. He's a very wealthy publisher with everything youth, looks, cars, women, et al. His best friend is played by Jason Lee, a sarcastic and forgiving guy always ready to party. He also works for Cruise as a writer. Cameron Diaz plays another friend of Cruise who also happens to be his booty call. She's a skanky, obsessive beauty with not much going on in her head except for dreams of being with Tom forever. The story begins with Tom Cruise in a jail talking to a psychologist, portrayed by Kurt Russell, about the murder that took place. Kurt is a warm, but firm man who could care, or could care less (if that makes any sense). Cruise begins his story at his birthday party where Jason brings a random girl he just met, who happens to be played by Penélope Cruz. She is a quiet, cute and exotic woman who captivates the attention of Tom, much to the chagrin of Cameron. Tom ends up spending a sleepless night with Cruz drawing caricatures of each other, and talking about random stuff, and invariably fall in love. When he leaves the next morning, he is in a massive automobile accident that crushes his arm and face. I've left out a little there because I don't want to spoil the plot. Cruise wakes from a coma weeks later with a disfigured face, and the surgeons really can't do much about his looks, and he has terrible headaches. He falls into a depression, and is struck with the feeling that he's unwanted by his friends, his company, and even Penélope. Tom finally learns they can repair his face, and things turn his way again. Cruz is finally his, and they live happily until things start happening that Tom's mind cannot reconcile.The movie is directed by the incredulous Cameron Crowe with the beauty and grace you would expect from him. Vanilla Sky easily slides in and out of beautiful scenes you'd expect from Monet if he did film, and harsh scenes of emotional intensity. The story is well written as well, and very much like Mark Twain's The Mysterious Stranger. There are better movies of this type, but this one does have its own feel to it (thanks to Crowe) that sets it apart as something special. It really is a great film about love, loss, and friendship.

","genre":"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"},{"date":"14 August 2006","score":"13 out of 19 people found the following review useful","review":" Basquiat is a film with an agenda. Far from being a neutral stage upon which the life and emotion of the artist is played out for us to observe, this film wants to make a point about the art world, casting Basquiat as Oliver Twist. If you are looking to find out what drives an artist you are not going to find it here - unless the answer is money. The filmmakers did not go very far into the head of their subject - either that or he was a very shallow and vapid person. I did not get the feeling from this film that Basquiat was a true artist; rather, he came off as an opportunist who figured out how to capture the mechanics of bad abstract impressionism and pass himself off as one. Then a lucky break, combined with silly art collectors who have way too much money and not enough of their own thought processes, multiplied by a guilt ridden population of white people flush with 1980's cash, combine to equal the phenomenon of Basquiat.I am not saying that this is (or is not) the truth. In the world of art there are no truths anyway. What I am saying is that this is not a neutral biography. It may pay to do a little bit of research into Basquiat before watching the film. As for myself, I admit to watching it only because I was bored and nothing else was on. I knew vaguely the story, and who Basquiat was, but had no opinions of and no real knowledge about him. Since I am not the type of person who forms his opinions on any subject based on information from only one source, I did some research into Basquiat after the film before coming to any sort of conclusions. What those conclusions were are irrelevant as far as this review is concerned - but what does concern me are the many people who undoubtedly had their opinion about Basquiat fed to them by this film and who now consider themselves educated on the subject.As far as the film itself, it is not bad. Not great, but not bad. It had a certain feeling to it. But it is hard to get beyond its portrayal of the subject, as he is the reason for the film. As noted, Basquiat comes off as an empty headed and shallow individual without a lot of talent or original thought who likes to use drugs and drink a lot. The film's Basquiat seemed not to care much about art, that it was an afterthought to him. He was shown as a dabbler - dabbling in music too but not doing much or giving it much effort. Perhaps that is the truth, I don't know, because overall the film is more a study of art and what constitutes it and gives it value than a biography of an artist - and postulates that today's art is more about the name than the actual piece. The same thing that is given away for free by a homeless man who lives in a box can be worth six figures if the right people decide that it should. I also felt that he filmmakers relied on cliché' a bit too much for my liking. The scene that sticks out in my mind is the one where Basquiat was on a schoolyard basketball court with his buddy, who was trying to get him to play. Basquiat was totally inept at the game and had no desire to play whatsoever. The filmmakers were obviously trying to demonstrate either one or both of two things - that Basquiat was so much of a cerebral artist that he was incapable of physical sport, or that Basquiat was a black man who could not play basketball. Whatever the case, the scene was painful to watch. It was ham-fisted imagery at its worst. A well done scene with some good conversation and emotion could have sent the same message intended in the schoolyard - actually could have done it better because as blockheaded as the schoolyard scene was, it still did not send a clear and defined message.The acting in Basquiat was for the most part serviceable, with David Bowie turning in the most inspired performance as Andy Warhol. Bowie brought a subtle warmth and humanity to a person who is often portrayed as a cold cartoon character. Although Warhol was clearly intended to be an exploiter in the film, Bowie managed to show him as a person who felt that Basquiat was a true friend and not just a paycheck. This is an Andy Warhol who cared about people, and who could have his feelings hurt just like anyone else. This is not the stereotypical movie Warhol, playing with people like the proverbial chess pieces. This Warhol genuinely admired the work of his protégés. And David Bowie would know, wouldn't he? He was there. I got the feeling that Bowie took the part to make a statement about Warhol - as if he was annoyed by younger filmmakers using the stereotypical Warhol image in an exploitative way. I felt that he was subversively reading the lines between the lines. Good for him.This film is more a commentary on the art world, on racism, and on exploitation than it is a biography. I would say that it is better to look at it this way, for as a biography it is biased and somewhat mean-spirited. Remember the first line of this review? It seemed to me that the filmmakers were saying that Basquiat was bereft of talent and inspiration - that he was a bum and a drug abuser who got lucky. Perhaps he was, but I'd prefer to make up my own mind. So it would pay to know a bit about the subject before watching - this Basquiat is a light dessert, not the main course.

His new bank manager, Milburn Drysdale expects his new billionaire clients to be the height of breeding and sophistication and is surprised to find that although the Clampetts are salt of the earth people, they aren't really Beverly Hills material.One of countless remakes of TV series of yesteryear, this basic, bland and unfunny affair is probably no better or worse than the average television show original but where that has the benefit of nostalgia to strengthen it, this film is left totally exposed in the cold light of modern American cinema. Without this protection the film must stand on its own thanks to a slick narrative, lots of laughs and so on. Sadly the makers seem to have forgotten this and the plot is a predictable and forced narrative along the lines of little people makin' good.

A bit of a problem when it then comes to following a story but then, hey, at least I'll be laughing too hard to care about the detail.Well, not really. The comedy here is very basic and seems happy to just rely totally on how stupid Jethro is; how tomboyish Elly is; how old Granny is and how everyone else either slaps their forehead with frustration at these characteristics or just do pratfalls over furniture. Attempts at postmodernism are mostly very lazy and lack any inspiration or genuine wit. It might appeal to children but it was all too little for me. The cast aren't able to help much but in fairness several of them are used to operating at this level. The late Varney is actually pretty restrained but this doesn't mean he is funny or produces a good character &#150; because he can't.

I had seen it before, but somehow now it became one of my favorite horror films. It has a style, beauty and grace that many horror films seem to miss nowadays. So naturally I set my eyes on seeing all of Michele Soavis horror films. I had already seen two of them The Church and Cemetery Man, and The Sect isn't out on DVD so I decided to see his only other movie on DVD which is Stagefright. This was Michele Soavis directorial debut, so I didn't really know what to expect. A flawed film made by an at the time rookie? A promising film with glimpses of greatness here and there? The story is about this group of actors that are putting up a play. They have very little time to practice some of the dance moves and songs so they are all under a lot of pressure. A psycho killer finds his way to the theater and locks everybody inside with absolutely no way out. Then he begins to systematically kill all the actors on the play in some really gruesome ways.Well its no secret that Soavi was Argentos pupil and I think that out of all of Soavis horror films that I have seen Stagefright is the one in which this is most evident. There's the killers point of view, some strange and interesting camera angles and even an animal themed killer. But thats not a bad thing in my book because eventually Soavi found his own voice and style as evidenced by his last horror film Cemetery Man. Still, Stagefright has a great style and look. What I love the most about Soavis films is that they deal with all these horrible killings, yet the film has a class and a finesse about it that kind of elevates the sleaziness of the slasher genre to a high that it rarely reaches.Don't get me wrong here, this movie may be artsy and classy, but its still very very much a slasher film. There's some truly brutal deaths here! After the movie sets up its premise the ball gets rolling really fast! Thats one of the things I liked the most about this movie it had a fast pace and wasn't boring in the least! Once the killer puts on that cool as hell Owls Head mask on his noggin things get really gory and interesting. From people being cut in half with chainsaws (great scene man!) to some cool decapitations this movie had me cheering for more! So slasher fans and fiends, you wont be disappointed! Another excellent thing about this movie was that it wasn't an incoherent mess. I've seen a lot of Lucio Fulci films, a lot of Dario Argento films and a few other Italian directors and they all suffer from the same illness. They cant seem to bring together a story and tell it in a coherent understandable fashion. Not so with Soavis Stagefright. I was surprised at how smoothly the story flowed and I was surprised that I was actually understanding it without any extreme effort. In a sense I would say that Soavi took everything that Argento and Fulci did wrong and did it right. He learned from their mistakes and therefore he is a better filmmaker for it. He is the next step in the evolutionary ladder as far as Italian Horror goes. This might also be why Soavi is heralded as the savior of Italian Horror by many a horror connoisseurs.So in conclusion, Stagefright is a solidly well directed slasher. One that showed promise for what is one of horrordoms best directors,even though his body of work is comprised of only four movies. I hope Soavi wakes up from that dream soon and delivers us with something as good or better then what he has already done. Soavi you the man!

Patric's character is one of the most twisted and narcissistic characters in cinema history, but he brings a vulnerability and a likability to the screen, and it's hard to hate him. You want to know where he's coming from, and you get a glimpse after he describes a brutal sexual encounter in which he attacks a classmate, and then says it's the best sex he ever had. Even though it is an ensemble cast, Patric owns the film. Eckhart, in a 360 turn from his character in the aforementioned In The Company of Men, plays a nerdy, emotionally distant husband who can't enjoy sex with anyone but himself. Amy Brenneman, as a neglected housewife who has an (almost) affair with Ben Stiller's character does a good job, but you never see it coming when she ends up with Patric, and it makes no sense. The always brilliant Catherine Keener puts in another deadpan performance, this time as the bitchy artist type who decides she prefers a woman (the luminous Nastasja Kinski) over Stiller.

Ben Stiller, who most of the time annoys me with his constant mugging and nervous jittery energy, fits in well with the cast, and you end up feeling sorry for his character. He means well, he just seeks out the wrong women.The movie is talky, but the conversations are riveting. You want to hear more, and learn more about what makes these characters tick.

Eckhart, in a 360 turn from his character in the aforementioned In The Company of Men, plays a nerdy, emotionally distant husband who can't enjoy sex with anyone but himself. Amy Brenneman, as a neglected housewife who has an (almost) affair with Ben Stiller's character does a good job, but you never see it coming when she ends up with Patric, and it makes no sense. The always brilliant Catherine Keener puts in another deadpan performance, this time as the bitchy artist type who decides she prefers a woman (the luminous Nastasja Kinski) over Stiller. She does get hers in the end, after she snottily rejects Patric's character and he puts her in her place. Ben Stiller, who most of the time annoys me with his constant mugging and nervous jittery energy, fits in well with the cast, and you end up feeling sorry for his character. He means well, he just seeks out the wrong women.The movie is talky, but the conversations are riveting. You want to hear more, and learn more about what makes these characters tick. Overall, I give the movie an 8 out of 10.

This movie is one of those typical well build up thrillers from the '70's, that however in the end still falls sort of flat, due to some improbabilities in the story.The movie begins slow, perhaps unnecessarily slow, to set up the characters and their relations. It does give the movie a certain sense of realism and at times suspense but it also provides the movie with some unnecessary long sequences that don't really add enough to the movie and its style. It's has '70's written all over it but the movie is not as 'experimental' as other genre movies from the same period. The cinematography by Victor J. Kemper is without any fancy tricks and the musical score by Jerry Goldsmith is (disappointingly) simple. All indications that this movie was made in the late '70's. It still has '70's style but without all the movie technical experimental elements, like genre movies from the more early '70's. It does make this movie more watchable for a wider audience.Basically from a technical point of view, the thriller elements in this movie are well build up and executed in the movie but unfortunately the story itself is filled with too many loose ends and improbabilities to consider this a perfectly made thriller. Too bad, since the premise itself of the movie is quite good. Especially in the end the movie becomes more and more unlikely. For instance why only just O.R. 8? Wouldn't that just arouse automatically suspicious after a while? And why does Susan Wheeler keep returning to the hospital, were she knows that she has more enemies than friends. All logically flawed plot elements that causes the movie to be a bit unlikely and not always credible as a thriller.It's nice to see that the main character of the movie is a female. Geneviève Bujold delivers a strong performance in the main lead. I don't know, for some reason the movie also becomes more realistic because of that the main lead is a female. With a male lead movies like these too often and too easy turn into heroic macho movies, which are not halve as credible. The movie also has a very solid supporting cast, with lots of actors that later grew out to be big ones, such as of course Michael Douglas but also Rip Torn, Tom Selleck and Ed Harris, who portray some much smaller roles.Overall this still is one fine typical '70's thriller.

First lets talk about the acting... I was only slightly impressed by Angelina's attempt at a new york accent. Other than that, I thought it was a less than stellar performance on all fronts. Come on, Dezel what the heck were you thinking? Hmm, maybe he thought he had already payed his dues making movies where he actually had to walk, and felt he owed it to himself to take it easy on this one. I felt he over acted throughout the whole picture. And that has got to be hard to do when you are stuck in a bed the entire time. Angelina was so skinny it was uncomfortable to watch. Aside from that, the whole melodramatic feel to the movie took away from it's coolness. It just seemed that the relationship between Denzel and Angie was forced and fake and totally romanticized, forcing it into something it wasn't at all.

But there is always a but especially with the 80s because there were so many cheesey Friday night action films or mainstream romantic comedies that comprised of typecast goof balls who got paid good money to do nothing. The 80s was also the decade where Buddy-cop movies were popular and the majority of them are bad or average. Still there were great exceptions, the stand out examples that stood out as brilliantly crafted action movies. The most famous and probably the best buddy cop film was Lethal Weapon, the one really kicked off the genre and showed promise. A year later Midnight Run came along and provided a whole new dimension for it all. Midnight Run is a mainstream film, but one with great intelligence that still provides entertainment all these years on.It easy for people to overlook Midnight Run and just see it as some goofy crime comedy that for some reason starred Robert De Niro. I personally feel Robert De Niro is perfectly cast and suits his role with great elegance, providing a wonderful array of humour to the cop Jack Walsh. Robert De Niro manages to take the role seriously and at the same time the film is very quirky. Charles Grodin manage to not get shoved aside by De Niro's tremendous acting ability and stays on par with De Niro's performance throughout the film's running time. Charles Grodin plays Jonathan Mardukas the sensitive accountant who just wants to get out of a mess that he mistakenly got himself involved in.I find it hard to see how anyone could not find Midnight Run entertaining, it mixes hilarious action with somewhat sentimental moments that are littered throughout the film. You might seem it strange that I've said sentimental, well surprisingly the film has realism and thought provoking moment. The whole See you in the next life is a great touch to a friendship created by accident. What makes the film more impressive that the average action comedy is the fact that the script is so tightly wrapped.The script is so fast paced and keeps the film's substance and characters on the same level as the viewer. The script is one that shows hard work and intelligence. It helps you understand these wacky characters and the crazy situations they have got themselves involved in.The films pacing level would not be as good as it was if it was not for the the witting one liner dialogue.

It seems more like a pat on the back for long and faithful service (and with a little added political correctness) than a true award for outstanding achievement. That being said i still think it's insane that this movie (or rather the actors in this movie) was nominated for two Academy Awards and received one.Now don't get me wrong, Denzel Washington is a terrific actor. I have seen and liked him in many parts but this just isn't one of them. In fact part of why this movie is such a failure is Denzel Washington. The whole streetwise cop-routine just doesn't work for him. He ends up looking like the kind of cop who wouldn't have survived one episode of The Shield (to name one similar reference). And still we are to believe that he is a man who has lived well off of bribe money for a long time.And the second issue of credibility is of course Ethan Hawke. I'm not an expert on the American police authorities but somehow i doubt that someone would like to put Ethan Hawke in plainclothes in an all-black\/Hispanic neighborhood. Even that issue put aside Ethan Hawke still looks like he's fifteen years old and completely lacks any credibility as a policeman. And for this he gets one Academy Award nomination? And beside these monumental issues? Well it's more or less like one long and quite poorly written episode of The Shield. The old jaded corrupt cop shows complete disregard for his own and his rookies safety when he plays the streets like an amateur throughout. The technical quality of the movie are OK, as is the scenery. The acting is not impressive though, although i would credit that to poor writing more than substandard actors.Training Day is a B-movie in every respect except one; it has stars attached to it and one of those stars was long overdue for an Academy Award. This movie could just as easily have been in theaters for two weeks and then gone right to the video store if you replaced Denzel with, say, Cuba Gooding Jr. And an over-acting star in a poorly written role does not a good movie make. Personally i lament that Denzel couldn't get his award for a more memorable performance, also in that regard is this movie a waste.

And beside these monumental issues? Well it's more or less like one long and quite poorly written episode of The Shield. The old jaded corrupt cop shows complete disregard for his own and his rookies safety when he plays the streets like an amateur throughout. The technical quality of the movie are OK, as is the scenery. The acting is not impressive though, although i would credit that to poor writing more than substandard actors.Training Day is a B-movie in every respect except one; it has stars attached to it and one of those stars was long overdue for an Academy Award. This movie could just as easily have been in theaters for two weeks and then gone right to the video store if you replaced Denzel with, say, Cuba Gooding Jr. And an over-acting star in a poorly written role does not a good movie make. Personally i lament that Denzel couldn't get his award for a more memorable performance, also in that regard is this movie a waste.

It seems more like a pat on the back for long and faithful service (and with a little added political correctness) than a true award for outstanding achievement. That being said i still think it's insane that this movie (or rather the actors in this movie) was nominated for two Academy Awards and received one.Now don't get me wrong, Denzel Washington is a terrific actor. I have seen and liked him in many parts but this just isn't one of them. In fact part of why this movie is such a failure is Denzel Washington. The whole streetwise cop-routine just doesn't work for him. He ends up looking like the kind of cop who wouldn't have survived one episode of The Shield (to name one similar reference). And still we are to believe that he is a man who has lived well off of bribe money for a long time.And the second issue of credibility is of course Ethan Hawke.

She was very funny as Sister Mary Clarence. This movie had a truly wonderful cast that I think helped make the movie a success. Mary Wickes, Kathy Najimy, and Wendy Makkena were fabulous supporting actresses and Maggie Smith as Mother Superior was a perfect fit. While this movie was definitely funny, the heartwarming elements also made it great. Some of my favorite scenes are certainly the choir performances, but also those in which the special bonds between the sisters are revealed.This film also has a stellar soundtrack, and I would highly recommend the sequel, Sister Act 2 Back in the Habit, to see the sisters in action again.

Fox..great as always)has a good thing going with his partnership with two ghosts as they con poor innocents to exorcise and replenish homes of ghoulish forces. What Frank doesn't see coming is a grim reaper type taking should from humans. He can see what victims will be chosen next by way of a number that forms on their foreheads. The reason behind Frank's unique ability to see and communicate with ghosts who didn't go into the light is that he went through a devastatingly traumatic experience when his wife was killed in a car crash caused by something he can't recall. She was found with a number cut into her forehead for which Frank can not recall. Frank's life will change forever when he exorcises the home of Ray and Lucy Lynskey. He sees a number appear on Ray's forehead and Lucy remembers this when her husband is taken from her thanks to a cardiac arrest. Frank can now communicate with Ray and this brings him to Lucy. Her belief in Frank is his anchor when all hell breaks loose as death stalks his next victim..Lucy! The film might be very interesting for Peter Jackson completists desiring to sample earlier works before his Lord of the Rings films. This film marks his American debut and you can see Peter's ability to use computer visual effects in such harrowing and awe-inspiring ways. The ghosts and how they movewell, particularly death as he moves through walls and such within the house of a woman named Patricia who was the partner-in-crime with serial killer Johnny Charles Bartlett(Jake Busey)are especially impressive. There's a major twist towards the end that is excellent and it deals with the identity of Death, the soul sucking reaper. Death's mission and a particular partner of his bring much suspense to the climax as Frank and Lucy must stop him at all costs. We watch as Frank tries to rescue humans before Death takes their souls and that also provides some thrilling moments. The whole film is one long wild roller-coaster as problems arise worse for Frank as he has a nemesis in an agent for the FBI named Milton Dammers. Dammers is at the brink of complete breakdown and we can see in how he approaches people & is effected by certain behaviors(such as women screaming..it ails him). Dammers has been a part of varying cults, working for the FBI, all his career and we see the horrors of this job etched in his entire being. Dammers has this will so strong it's boundless to put an end to Frank's practices. He uses Lucy in many ways to do just that. I feel Dammers is in this film mainly as a fork in the road to Frank and Lucy's quest to stop Death and there are many moments where he causes complete conflict. Combs plays him quite freakish and he's memorable in every scene he's in. Dee Wallace as Patricia stretches madness and terror, but this particular character is much more to the inner story of Death's quest than meets the eye. Jake has that sinister, twisted chagrin that works well in his scenes as Johnny, the killer. But, the film's dynamic is Fox's energy and Trini Alvarado's(Lucy..I couldn't take my eyes off her she's so beautiful)serene face..they gel so well in their scenes together. I do feel that many might look too hard at the angles regarding the abilities for people to jump in and out of death by unusual ways(particularly Fox's hero..his ability to do this might be a bit of a stretch), and one might could dissect how Death does what he does and how he does it. But, if you just go with it, I'm sure many horror fans will be very entertained.

Watching it again was almost like a fresh experience. Depp was very young, Ryder was a teenager, and they were perfect. The DVD extras has a few sound bites from several actors and the writer and I was particularly struck by how poorly the young Depp expressed himself. But that is history.An old inventor (Vincent Price) living on the mountain at the end of the cul-de-sac in this flat Florida suburb has made this boy, Edward (Johnny Depp), but didn't have a chance to finish him when he dropped dead. Edward still had scissors for hands, and many nicks on his face from inadvertent cuts.Peg (Diane Wiest) is an Avon sales lady and is having a particularly unproductive day, when she decides to drive up to the old house on the hill, go in, and try to find someone to sell Avon to. She encounters Edward and does what any mom would do, she took the orphan home, gave him some clothes, and sat him at the dinner table with the family.Edward is, of course, very different. While the old inventor explained lots of things to him, Edward had never experienced social settings, he had no idea what real people did in real everyday life. Kim (teenager Winona Ryder, before her felony days) is Peg's daughter and she sort of takes a sympathetic liking to Edward, in the end defending him against her mean boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall). Kathy Baker plays Joyce, the over sexed neighbor who tries to seduce Edward, and Alan Arkin, sounding a lot like Christopher Walken, is the dad, Bill, who takes everything in stride.The movie is mostly entertainment, seeing how this unusual character Edward copes with his new surroundings. But it is also a story about acceptance of someone who is different. Edward never quite fits in, even though he fascinates people with his skill, sculpting hedges or cutting hair. The movie has a somewhat dark ending, but the only one possible in this impossible situation.SPOILERS FOLLOW. Jim is relentless, and ends up following Edward back to the old house on the hill, along with Kim. He is mistreating her too and, angry, Edward stabs him and Jim falls to the ground below, bleeding and eventually dead. Kim tells the gathering crown that Edward died in the building collapse, but in fact he was safe. Kim narrates the story as a very old woman and when the little girl asks if Edward still lives she says she is sure of it, because before him it never snowed, but now it snows every winter.
