It is easy to compare this film, with the two previous Dirty Harry movies, because there some things have (still) not changed. First of all, Harry (obviously) kept his cheeky mouth, which again provides the viewer with the necessary laughs and his boss with the necessary headaches. This is not the only thing that has stayed the same though. Again some of the scenes could have been shorter, thus (theoretically) making The Enforcer a much tighter package. A perfect example of that is the scene in which Harry chases a bad guy to the rooftop of a building. Not only could this scene have been shorter, but it could also have been much more exciting had there been adequate use of music and cinematography. There is however one upside to this installment in the Dirty Harry series, which is, that it is far more stable than it's predecessors. It is not a decent or good film film, but it gets very close, mainly because of the good acting and the fact that the film remained interesting for the despite it's downsides. Best Dirty Harry film until then. If you want to know if it is the best in the series, check my comment for Sudden Impact.6,5 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 November 2003","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  This film was to be Dirty Harry's last outing in the seventies (do not worry though, he had two comebacks in the eighties).

The basic premise has been copied to death by weaker films, and everyone who sees it remembers Ned Beatty squealing like a pig.I won't rehash the plot, since it is so familiar, but I'd like to point out a few highlights. This film obviously wishes to point out what a previous reviewer mentioned about there being a big difference between having an appreciation for nature and being able to deal with it. Burt Reynold's character was by far the best equipt of the four main guys and he still got the crap beat out of him by the river. I think that his speech about them leaving the body of the hillbilly behind was the most impressive dramatic point of his up and down career. I love that scene!This film also goes to great lengths to show the difference between city folk and country folk. No matter what part of the country you live in, the biggest difference between people I have ever seen is the one between rural and urban types. Here in Nebraska, you have two main groups Those of us who live in Lincoln or Omaha and.....the rest. It may be unfortunate that these differences exist, but they really do!I like this film because it makes you really think about what you would do if you were in the main characters' shoes. My gut reaction was that Reynolds had the right idea by convincing them not to go to the cops. It seems like this film is setting Ronny Cox up to be the wimp when he insists they tell the cops about the rape\/murder incident. But, when they let his dead body go for the last time, I think it was Voigt's character who says he was the best of us.Anyway, this is a very good film. Not everyone will be impressed, but such is life. This film has great music, creepy hillbillies, white water rafting, a quick glimpse of a cottonmouth snake, people getting shot with arrows, and much more. I strongly recommend it.9 of 10 starsSo sayeth the Hound.

I agree, the movie was obviously very long, but if you enjoy history you will probably not mind.  In addition, reading Michael Shaara's The Killer Angels, with which this movie was based on, helps to build a better understanding with the common viewer about certain events in the movie and characters.  Most notably, why General Lee had to attack and stay on and fight at Gettysburg, why General Garnett had to ride at Pickett's Charge etc.Overall, a very moving film and extremely well-done.
