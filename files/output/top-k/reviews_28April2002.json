There are two very strong reasons to see this film the visuals and the music score. Both are gorgeous. Director Tim Burton and composer Danny Elflman are in top form. It's those damn screenwriters who sucked all the potential out of this film. For starters, we've got too many characters competing for precious screen time.

Instead, this boring guy steals the 'main villain' credit. There was also a huge backlash over this film being too dark. Let me be the first to support the decision to change the Penguin's origin and demeanor. As Burton himself said, some little guy in a tuxedo just would not have worked. There's also been criticism that as  a bad guy, you just felt sorry for the penguin... you didn't fear him. I found this added a whole other layer to the film. Believe me, it was intentional. Batman and the Penguin were of the same ilk. So-called freaks from the same background who walked different paths. What made one go one way and the other another? Could it just as easily have been the other way around? Far more interesting than typical maniacal villain b.s. We have Catwoman and Shreck to fit that stereo-type. My biggest complaint about the script is that because of all the new villains, Batman gets even less screen time in this installment than he did in the first film. This is not a Batman film.

Not surprisingly, it fails on all counts.I'd like to be nice and just say that it's an interesting idea that is just not done right.  But it's really not even that interesting the way it's presented.  A couple of New Yorkers on opposite ends of the monetary and social spectrum get into a car accident.  Without getting into the silly plot, the two proceed to get hell bent on destroying the others life.  These are not necessarily bad guys at heart, mind you; their dark sides are simply taking hold of them.  The film pretends to be different in the different things the characters do to each other throughout.  The problem is, the manner and style in which this different story is presented is no different than any other garden variety thriller to come out of Hollywood.  Standard character setup, accident\/plot point, altercation, altercation, altercation, revelation, revelation, happy ending.  It's really not even this that I have such a problem with.  I only point it out because I find it laughable that so many moviegoers and film critics find this film to be so different and unconventional.  Perhaps if Christopher Nolan, Aronofsky, or the Coen brothers got a hold of it, it could be those things. The real problem I have with this film are the two lead actors, especially Ben Affleck.  Twenty minutes into this film, I knew that he was incapable of playing the character the way it should be played.  Affleck is the master of playing the smug, cocky and arrogant character.  But when any sort of emotion, depth, or other dimension of the character needs to come out, I always want to laugh Affleck right off the screen.  He's a BAD actor.  His sort of cheesy and one dimensional acting could cut it in soap operas, but it doesn't fly in feature films.  This character, despite the fact that he may inherently be good, has an evil and harmful side (as we all do) that comes out throughout the day.  Affleck plays that side of the character like he's playing a video game.  And since the whole film is dependent on the believable coming out of the evil sides of Affleck and Jackson, it fails when these two actors cannot deliver.While I think this role was way too much for Affleck, I think Jackson could have pulled it off.  He's shown a dark and desperate side in a number of films.  But in this one, I found him no more convincing than Affleck.  I really would have loved to see what Guy Pearce and Don Cheadle could have done with these characters.The actors are not helped at all by a terrible script (possible spoilers).  First of all, it's another one of those there's no way all that could happen in one day films.  Not just one day, but about 8 hours.  But it's the finer points of this script that make it so implausible as a whole.  Affleck offering a blank check?  Laughable.  No one is going to do that, except maybe Bill Gates.  The incredibly easy way in which Affleck obtains the truth about his partners involvement with the signature fraud?  I'm sure that in real life, such incriminating documents would be under lock and key, not in a file cabinet where anyone could access them.  I'm no expert on cars, but I would imagine that Affleck's Mercedes would have wheel locks to prevent someone (without the proper equipment) to remove or loosen his lugnuts.  It seemed as though every scene had some sort of incredibly ridiculous thing that lied at the center of it.And then there was the happy ending, which just didn't fit in with the dark tone of the film as a whole.  Ending with the somber revelations that Affleck and Jackson make near the end would have made the film much more gritty, socially conscious and realistic, like I think they intended it to be.  What had been a C- film up to that point fell to a D for me.The supporting cast was probably the only redeeming thing about this film.  Toni Collette quietly added another subtlely solid film to her repertoire, and I wanted to see more of her character.  Sydney Pollack always seems to pick his roles carefully, this one being no exception.  The noteable exception was the laughable performance (one scene, really) of Amanda Peet.  Too much.  No one talks or makes speeches like that.Usually, good films of this nature are independently made.  There's just too much money, too many egos and too may collaborators with a major studio film.

After seeing it, I was unsure if I had seen a good movie or not. I knew I had not seen a bad one, but I did not think it was a masterwork either.I allowed myself to get excited about a film directed by Steven Spielberg. He is easily the greatest filmmaker in cinematic record. The single best moment in Hollywood history is 'Schindler's List,' followed by 'Saving Private Ryan.' Unfortunately, 'A.I.' is not close to either of those films. It is even safe to say that 'A.I.' is no 'E.T.' either. In fact, I could easily create a long list of more satisfying movies from Spielberg.The first hour asks us to accept a robot as a real living, loving boy, and it seems that the boy eventually does earn the family life he was hoping for.But, the organic, normal people decide they don't want him anymore, and that is when the film takes a radical tangent I could not fully accept. It descends into nothing more than an odd quest, and when the boy finds it, it does not satisfy us in anyway.Let me defend Spielberg slightly to a point. He was working with ideas that started with Stanley Kubrick. Spielberg did it to honor Kubrick, but made a big mistake.

A sequel to the great action flick was a must!!  Unfortunately the first sequel is not everything it should have been, and in some aspects it was too much of some things.  Joe Pesci being the too much.  The story line seemed jumbled and hard to follow.  Diplomats from South Africa are hiding behind their diplomatic immunity in order to carry out a drug smuggling organization and some other things that are forgettable or too hard to figure out to remember.  Gibson and Glover are nonetheless perfect as Riggs and Murtaugh.  The two best friends and partners are closer than ever and on their toes.  Unfortunately they don't have a lot to work with when it comes to the bad storyline.  Joe Pesci is brought into the mix as a witness that they have to protect from the diplomats who are also money laundering or some fool thing.  The movie starts out promising with action packed scene in grand Richard Donner tradition.  The comedy in the film between Riggs and Murtaugh, their one liners, and bantering between the two of them is hilarious and perfect, but all of a sudden completely unnecessary Joe Pesci comes in and he is just too much...he is definately the Jar Jar Binks of Lethel Weapon.  He is barely funny and is just slapstick comedy that doesn't sit right in the movie.  The bad guys are not scary and we don't hate them, in fact, they are forgettable and easily defeated.  Riggs also finds himself falling in love again with a beautiful diplomat working for the bad guys.  She doesn't like her boss and she hates what he's in to and eventually he becomes her demise in a very touching scene.  The romance is very good, and we feel for Riggs losing another lover.  Riggs also discovers that one of the men working for this bad guy is the man who killed his wife...which is an interesting and a good storyline but it's handled very poorly.  Riggs doesn't get the kind of revenge that perhaps we would like to see him get against his wife's and his new lover's killer. The movie was also chock full of bad language that is completely misplaced and annoying...it's gratuitous.  As well the body count rises as Riggs and Murtaugh kills everyone in their path which is TOO unrealistic and borders on crazy.  Even certain explosions and car accidents would have killed civilians but that is never mentioned either.  Usually in an action film this is overlooked but there is just sooooooo much of it that you can't miss that fact of it.  Overall it's a sequel that falls very short of the amazing original.  However, it's a must see just because of Gibson and Glover and it's part of this wonderful action series.  I have given it harsh words but it entertained me and despite the negatives it's not bad.

If The Rock's starring debut is any indication, this summer will be the worst on record.  Scratch that; it's not an indication, it's a warning.  Summer movies are here; no brains allowed.Audiences should have known something was up when Universal claimed they were so excited by The Rock's `performance' in The Mummy Returns that they simply had to give him his own starring vehicle.  In his five minutes of actual screen time (the rest of his performance was completed by a CGI scorpion), he did little more than grimace, grunt, and growl.This film charts the character's ascendancy, from mercenary named Mathayus to a powerful sovereign capable of a transformation into a giant CGI creature.  A terrible despot named Memnon (Steven Brand) rules the ancient world with an iron, arrow-catching fist, with the aid of a clairvoyant, semi-nude sorcerer (Kelly Hu).  Over the course of ninety-odd minutes and endless swordfights, Mathayus tries time and time again to kill Memnon while bearing his teeth and arching his eyebrow.Clearly a film in the Conan vein, The Scorpion King gives The Rock plenty of opportunity to twirl things in the air and glower with hammy abandon.  Of course, the dialogue is kept to a minimum.  `I've come for the woman &#150; and your head' is about the most complex sentence Mathayus utters; although you might be inclined to believe that the character's silence is less a function of his stupidity than the film's inability to go more than four minutes without increasing the body count.I never thought I could miss the Mummy movies so much. While Steven Sommers' movies were dumb, he knew how to make great action sequences.  The Scorpion King, all clanging swords with squishy sound effects, is a film dying for a great action scene.  Time and time again, indistinct royal guards charge The Rock, who dispatches them with quick, bloodless swipes from his sword.  Helpfully, The Rock's sword appears to be enchanted; no matter how many times it gets lost or broken, it always reappears at his waist at the start of the next scene.In a crazier movie, The Rock's overbearing acting style, wide eyed and frowning like he smells something bad, could work.  But director Chuck Russell's work is uninspired; he's missing the sense of uninhibited abandon he brought to The Mask.  A novel of The Scorpion King would probably be just as bad as the movie; there are no standout images, no great fights, no good performances, and nothing worth remembering.  It is the epitome of bad Hollywood filmmaking.  Here's hoping this bad omen is only a false alarm.

This symbolism is personified by Danny Parker, played by Val Kilmer, who, after suffering from an unexpected and brutal crime that killed his wife, has sunk so low that his life has virtually evaporated, leaving him only with despair. His only way out is to completely transform himself into something else, someone new, in order to avenge her death. But, the task is so demanding, requiring a full and complete commitment, that he loses a sense of himself - who he really was, or is, or will become.To disclose more of the film's plot would give too much away, since its effect is dependent on unexpected twists and turns and the slow discovery of new information. To gradually learn of Danny's motivations and the unfolding of his past are part of the movie's best qualities. It's Danny in the spotlight, and Kilmer does a reasonably good job at depicting the various moods that Danny goes through. But, it's also evident that the movie was made for Kilmer himself, since minor characters are so strongly de-emphasized. With such a dependence on a single actor, Kilmer has a lot riding on his shoulders, and while his performance is noteworthy, he doesn't carry it to extraordinary levels that would warrant awards by any of the more well-known and respected organizations.I have a similar view about the film as a whole its positive points are good, but too many weaknesses failed to give the film a three-dimensional quality. It's like a film-noire version of Pulp Fiction - there are lots of fast-paced, drug-induced acts of violence, all with a pinch of sardonic humor, fully aware that it's mocking a movie genre as well as a subculture. At the same time, Danny's quiet, drawling narrative voiceovers, the subtle interplay between the characters, and the classic use of lighting are clearly from the film-noire genre. I enjoyed the film as I watched it, but after I left, I became more aware of the missed opportunities for more depth in supporting characters, and more history in the lives and motivations of the villains.I mildly recommend The Saltan Sea if you're a Kilmer fan and want to watch his career evolve. It  should be a good platform for his next performance in a serious role, and I look forward to seeing it. So, while this isn't a bad film by any means, it's just not strong enough to stand out in the crowd of movies of a similar vein. Two films that I liked better in the same genre were Positive ID (1997) and last year's Momento.

As in Rocky III, Stallone kills off one of the major characters in the series as Appollo Creed is killed fighting Russian fighting machine Ivan Drago in a superbly staged fight, and this sets up a grudge match between the Soviet and our hero Rocky Balboa...in Russia! Which is the perfect set up for an utterly fantastic training sequence (in my opinion the best of the five films) as Rocky trains in the mountains, chopping logs, climbing mountains (!) as Drago trains in a state of the art space-age training gym, boosted by performance enhancing drugs. Its the good old USA v The Soviet Union, who needs a nuclear war when you can settle your diffrences in the ring. This part dates Rocky IV badly, and to be honest the sheer anti-communist feel of the film sits uneasily in the Rocky series, also one of the best things of the films was Rockys easy going, likeable personality, but after Appolos death he's more like Rambo than Rocky.

'Tetsuo' is short (barely over an hour), difficult to follow, physically and morally exhausting because of its graphical and musical violence, and above all painful. Shot in a white-saturated (metallic) B&W, with a nearly always trembling frame and rapid and repetitive stop-motion sequences, this movie contains scenes of such weird and intense pain that you can nearly feel it. That should suffice to explain why there are usually two reactions to 'Tetsuo' either you enjoy it like an intense and truly unique experience, or you can't bear it at all (above all if you follow Tsukamoto's advice watching the film alone, with maximum sound and as close to the screen as possible!!).So what is it all about? What makes this seemingly nonsensical and weird object the major, groundbreaking film it has been said to be? Well, the difference between nonsense and art is usually the presence of meaning. And preferably deep and multiple meanings. And there's all that in Tetsuo. The story in itself is quite simple in fact, once you've seen the film a couple of times A young metal-fetichist-freak is hit by a car and remembers the driver, dreaming of vengeance. His hate manifests itself on the culprit (a depressingly normal japanese salary man) by transforming him progressively into a mad machine. The salary man is in for a real nightmare as his monstrous metamorphosis causes chaos and death around him, until the final confrontation with the young freak (also transformed in a metal\/flesh mutant but quickly rusting) where they accept their monstrosity and declare war to the rest of the world, announcing a new world of metal and pain.What is really interesting in 'Tetsuo' is the fact that these two metal monstrosities are presented as the only ones in an already dead world (or at least the city of Tokyo) who find a way to be really alive. By mutating through metal and pain, they find a way out of a world of zombies, out of the oppression of the city and of 'normal' life. They achieve a nearly godlike status. Tsukamoto's vision is influenced by his own extremely negative vision of modern urban life, which in his films looks like a post-apocalyptic life where everything is already dead, albeit nobody seems to know it yet. His characters, be it in 'Tetsuo' I and II, 'Tokyo Fist' or 'Bullet Ballet', through the pain they experience, find out that they can be still alive, at the cost of discovering and admitting the monsters that they contain (deadly metal monsters in 'Tetsuo', boxing machines in 'Tokyo Fist'). Tsukamoto shows this way of violence and pain as the only solution. Whether it is optimistic or pessimistic is for the viewer to decide. And the best way to decide this is to experience the pain yourself! That's the basic justification of provoking such a shocking experience for the audience forcing the choice, forcing the discovery of a sort of pleasure, beyond the pain, and admitting its existence to oneself.With that sort of content, it is thus not very surprising that people like William Gibson or Alejandro Jodorowsky declared themselves fascinated by 'Tetsuo'. Neither is it surprising that 'Tetsuo' is placed among the films that gave a new start to japanese cinema (after all, Tsukamoto sees the japanese cinema of the 80s as as dead as Tokyo's inhabitants...).Some people might argue that there's not so much to be seen or understood in 'Tetsuo' and that if those were the director's intentions, the film does not meet them. Well, that might be true, but I think of Tetsuo' in very much the same way as 'Eraserhead' (above the evident formal influences, mixed with Cronenberg's) 'Testuo' is a sort of original matrix from which all of Tsukamoto's subsequent movies emanate. 'Testuo' can thus be better read and understood through 'Tetsuo II' (its more explicit remake\/sequel) or even 'Tokyo Fist'. It is a sort of artistic manifesto, but not adressed to the mind rather to the body and the flesh, which integrate the meaning before reason can analyze it.
