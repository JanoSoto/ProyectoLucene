[{"date":"22 April 2004","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Rounders is a fantastic movie. I think the only reason people criticize this movie is because they know nothing about poker. Oh well, that's just their bad luck they can't enjoy this brilliant movie. The characters are great, especially Worm, and all actors did a fine job. There are so many excellent quotes in the movie, most of them narrated by Matt Damon's character, and I just love the philosophy that some of those quotes are about and how they are related to life. It's a movie about tactics, decisions, and risks. Great stuff. You can watch this movie over and over and never get tired of it, and if you are a poker player, it really gives you great hints. I beg for a sequal.  ","genre":null},{"date":"22 April 2004","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Rounders is a fantastic movie.
