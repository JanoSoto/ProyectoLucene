The long list of FAQs for this one is mute evidence in support. When I saw the film in 1992, for the first time, I was intrigued but also disappointed. Seeing it again on DVD, I think Tarantino sacrificed clarity for the sake of speeding up the action &#150; because, being such a talky film, he had to keep the action going to appease the audience. This, after all, was a diamond heist that went wrong, not a garage sale for diamonds...Some might argue that the violence is excessive. I disagree, mainly because Tarantino very explicitly laid out what types of men these were during the overly long talkfest at the lunch feast misogynist, narrow-minded, callous, racist and psychotic &#150; but, in an exchange completely at odds with those attitudes, showed them dipping in to help out the waitress with a big tip. The only reason for that must be to show just how different Mr Pink (Steve Buscemi) is to the rest - which is important throughout this narrative.So, the violence that follows is quite in character for all of them, even for Mr Orange (Tim Roth) who shoots a woman who shoots him, as he and Mr White (Harvey Keitel) steal her car. I think Tarantino did a good job in showing just how violent these violent people can be, leaving the viewer with an implied lesson, of course don't do crime, or crime will do you! It was great to Lawrence Tierney again - even though he was almost impossible to recognize (playing the Big Boss, Joe Cabot) as I'd seen him in many B movies in my youth.In the end, however, I'd didn't care two hoots for any of the characters, except for Officer Nash (Kirk Baltz), the only person with real courage and honour, as he refused to reveal who the rat was.This was the first Tarantino film I saw. It's not his best. If you want that, see Jackie Brown (1997), an Elmore Leonard novel that Tarantino puts to film very well.

Had this script been even a small bit weaker, this film would have be awful due to it's lead. Farrow is the product of celebrities, that is how she became one herself, it was never due to any talent or acting ability. She has been extremely lucky to get amazing material to work with, thus many confuse the material for her ability to act. Had this part been given to a good (or even great) actress, this would have been one of those masterpieces that everyone speaks of often. Instead, her lack of ability or any natural talent brings the whole production to a much lower level. My advice, watch this with the closed captioning on your television or DVD player turned on, it's a much better movie when you can concentrate on the brilliance of Allen's script without having to be subjected to Farrow's, her acting (and I use that term loosely for what she does) is rudimentary at it's best and verges straight into horrendousness. She once again gets a gift of great writing and manages to turn it into garbage, just as she's done in Allen's other works in which she starred, September, The Purple Rose Of Cairo, A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy, Husbands and Wives (et al).
