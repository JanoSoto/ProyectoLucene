So, when I watched it on DVD I was pleasantly surprised how engaging a film it is.I am not a gambler, so maybe that is part of why I found it so fascinating. Basic story - Damon's character is a 2nd yr law student in NYC, and a good enough poker player that he has aspirations of entering and winning the million-dollar prize in the world series of poker in Lasvegas. However, Ed Norton plays his good buddy just getting out of prison. Norton's character is also a poker player, but also incorporates cheating because that just helps you make money faster. This approach gets both of them in some pretty hot water, and also deep in debt!!Damon's character has a S.O. played by Gretchen Mol. Her distaste for gambling puts a great strain on their relationship. Will she stay, or will she move out??And finally, John Malkovich does a wonderful job as the Russian gambler nicknamed KGB. John Turturro is perfectly cast as Damon's friend and street advisor. I simply found myself caught up in this story, anticipating the next poker game, wondering if they would all get whacked, or survive. Plus, Matt Damon has such a relaxed acting style, with that great smile of his, which makes all of his movies easy to watch.I rate this one 8 of 10 for the well-done gambling drama depicted here.

A more appropriate comparison would be the recent docudrama of Huey Long, KINGFISH.  While John Goodman is excellent as Long and the movie worthwhile, it reveals just how good a film ALL THE KING'S MEN is.Of course, Robert Rossen's picture has a drab look.  It should. It suggests the drab appearance of most U.S. states (anyone who has visited Kansas will know why Dorothy and L. Frank Baum wanted to go over the rainbow) and the use of common townsfolk rather than Hollywood extras adds to this look, as do the drab locations (check out something like the Marlon Brando movie THE CHASE, a movie that should have a drab look, but instead looks like a glossy Hollywood backlot).  Thank God Columbia, a studio that loved locations because it had no back lot, financed this movie!  I wouldn't call this film realistic, but I've read the pulitzer prize winning novel, and I wouldn't call it realistic either.  Every page brims with beautifully poetic language which the movie often incorporates and which Rossen makes sound more like natural conversation than it really is.  Compared to the book, the film, I think, reveals its real weaknesses it does simplify moral issues and also reduces some of the characters to the level of melodrama (Willie Stark, in the novel, resembles more someone like Andy Griffith's character in A FACE IN THE CROWD a charming good ole boy you want to love, but who will knife you in the back the next minute).  Broderick Crawford, with his Bronx accent, hardly suggests either a hayseed or, as he calls himself a hick, but he has a bullying power that I think is brilliant for the role.  Personally, I'm glad neither Spencer Tracy nor John Wayne (both of whom Rossen wanted) got the part.And I think this movie holds up very well, even in our post-Watergate era of cynical politics  like the novel, it shows how the populist leader can easily be a tyrant.  This message is not in CITIZEN KANE the lofty Kane was never one of the people; he just wanted to be one of the people.  Considering how much Hollywood in the era of Harry Truman embraced the populist sentiment with the films of John Ford and Frank Capra, considering that dictators like a Hitler and a Stalin like to present themselves as one of the people and enjoyed popular support, considering how much Americans love politicians who are charming rather than substantial, I'd say Rossen's film hasn't dated at all.

It seems a lot of people miss the whole point of the movie; these two air traffic controllers are competing to be the ultimate, the coolest, the most together and in-control guys on the planet. But ultimately, they're demonstrating the futility of trying to maintain control over one's life or one's surroundings.Interestingly enough, this is one of the few John Cusack movies where he plays a significant role as someone other than the typical Cusack... his fans know the role. A self-deprecating, extremely neurotic, overly talkative insecure man who happens to also be gifted and charming in really quirky ways. Think Grosse Pointe Blank or Say Anything. In this film, Cusack's character is really not a likeable guy (perhaps because he reminds a lot of us of characteristics in ourselves we don't like).I don't think Cate Blanchett or Angelina Jolie are wasted in this movie; they play very well into their roles, but don't exceed them and impede the point of the movie. While we're not really used to seeing Cate as a typical housewife, I think she does a very good job of highlighting the quiet insecurities and struggles many women in that walk of life endure. She never steals the show from Cusack and Billy Bob, but I found myself much more attracted to her character than either of theirs. Cusack's character is arrogant and horribly insecure, and Thornton's seems to fancy himself a guru simply because he's only slightly less active with his own insecurities than Cusack. These guys are a stereotypical pair of type A personalities.When all is said and done, though, this movie does a nice job of getting across a good lesson in life, all the while posing as a comedy (and it does have it's share of witticisms and excellent one liners). My only big quarrel with it is that the ending seems much too sugar coated; I won't ruin it completely for you, but after you see it (which you should) try to imagine it ending a bit more within the framework of the concept of being tossed into the jetwash of a 747, and liking it.

But in They Live, John Carpenter turns it into the almost-ultimate word in satires of American culture at the end of the twentieth century. It would be the ultimate, in fact, if Paul Verhoeven had not beaten him to the punch in the previous year with RoboCop. Both films depict an America that is in the terminal stages of its addiction to capitalism, although they also approach the material from completely different tacks. While RoboCop uses a cog in the increasingly totalitarian wheel to depict a system and a world gone mad, They Live instead tells the tale from the perspective of a total outsider. It is not a coincidence that our central protagonist's name translates into English as nothing. He is a full representation of the ever-growing underclass that the wheel rolls over. Here, John Carpenter's fiendish imagination fleshes out a tale of who really rules in a world where the President is basically an actor.Nada, played with a surprising restraint by Roddy Piper, starts the story as exactly what his name implies. He is nothing, a mere cog in the system that is leaving him without a place to work. As he talks his way into a job on a construction site, one of his new co-workers shows him a place to stay and get food. Coincidentally, it happens to be near a church where some strange goings-on can be observed. Meanwhile, the television set in the nearby outdoor group home is acting up, breaking the program every so often to present a speech that, in fragmentary form, makes little sense. Most of the residents dismiss it as just being the work of a crank, but Nada's curiosity grows until he sneaks into the aforementioned church and discovers that the broadcasts are coming from there. Not long after, the police raid the church, and the people hacking the television signal are scattered to the four winds. But Nada manages to investigate what the police left behind.The moment when Nada opens the box and finds nothing but sunglasses is puzzling, but nothing can prepare one for what soon follows. Putting them on, he discovers that what the man on the hacked television signal has been saying is true. Signs depicting models suddenly bear messages saying MARRY AND REPRODUCE, and it gets even more puzzling from there. It is not until a rich-looking businessman comes to buy a newspaper that the shocking truth becomes fully evident. How John Carpenter so seamlessly pulled off the contrasts between the world we see and that monochrome real world would make for an amazing audio commentary in itself, but alas, no DVD with this feature exists yet. By most commercial standards, the film was a roaring success, earning over three times its production budget at the box office. Matter of fact, it only cost two-thirds what it cost to make Escape From New York, at least if you believe the IMDb. Carpenter must have kept in practice in the years between these two films, as They Live looks more like it cost fourteen million.As I have intimated in the subject line, Chris Carter must have really liked both The Thing and They Live, as almost all of The X-Files' material is more or less directly lifted from those two films. This, however, is an example of the aliens secretly controlling the world idea done the right way. Knowing that the idea alone is too preposterous for the audience to accept, Carpenter surrounds it with details of the workings of their society within a society. In less time than it takes Carter and company to meander around a single X-Files episode, Carpenter creates a living, breathing alien civilisation. He expertly suspends reality in graduating steps. It is not until the second act that we get the idea that all is not what it seems, and then it is only for brief flashes. Our hero reacts in much the same manner as any of us would. First by having doubts about his sanity, then by hedonistically exploiting the situation. It is not until the final act that our heroes get it into their heads to do something about it. By this time, the monochrome effects showing the aliens in their true form are minimised. It has the pleasant side effect of emphasising that the heroes now see clearly.If there is a weakness in They Live, it may be that the pacing is off. Scenes that establish the problem and its solution go by in less than a minute at times, but a brawl between the two main characters takes more than five minutes. There also seems to be a sense that the resistance network shown consists of only one cell somewhere in America. Perhaps this was the effect that Carpenter wanted, but it does throw the viewer out of the film at times. Roddy Piper is not the best actor, but this part literally has his name all over it. His dialogue in the bank robbery could only have come out of his mouth. This soon gave rise to the Wrestler Rule when you want a character to sound boisterous nine out of ten times, cast a former professional wrestler. Keith David does not let the side for real actors down, either. His portrayal of slowly becoming more of a believer is what keeps the viewer in the reality of the film during much of its latter half.I gave They Live a nine out of ten. I paid something like thirteen American dollars to buy it from Amazon, and I felt it was money well-spent. I can mention it in the same breath as RoboCop, and that is not an easy thing for a film to achieve. It is a perfect postcard of the 1980s. See it post-haste.

His portrayal of slowly becoming more of a believer is what keeps the viewer in the reality of the film during much of its latter half.I gave They Live a nine out of ten. I paid something like thirteen American dollars to buy it from Amazon, and I felt it was money well-spent. I can mention it in the same breath as RoboCop, and that is not an easy thing for a film to achieve. It is a perfect postcard of the 1980s. See it post-haste.

But, the more i watched the movie, the more i liked it. So, by the time i heard about the third in the Scream series, I was counting down the days till it came out. I ended up seeing it the day after it came out with my best friend. I found that it was scary, original, and had some really good fight scenes and unforgettable characters (PARKER POSEY'S JENNIFER JOLIE). The voice changer this time was really unique and very clever. I also thought the buddy\/hatred-ness  between Courteney Cox and Parker Posey was hysterical. Mainly i thought Parker fueled most of the movie with her comedic preformances. I thought the ending at Roman's birthday was truly the best. And i was also surprised to see Jenny McCarthy give such a good performance for just the short time she was in it. David Arquette also gave a good performance, along with the rest of the cast.  Neve Campbell was great with her lines like It's your turn to scream, ***hole! and You want me, mother******, come and get me! I found those to be effective if not cliched.

Not exactly the life of the party, now are we?  Wharton knew from sadness, and when she wrote novels like Ethan Frome and The Age of Innocence she infused them with a tragedy unknown in any other author of the time.  The latter work in particular is a tear-inducing criticism of a society that quashes the life out of passionate individuals who dare to feel for themselves without asking permission from the rest of the world.Martin Scorsese, the man most famous for giving gangsters a loud, cinematic voice, has done the unthinkable he has made what is probably the most elegant film ever created.  Out-costuming the Merchant Ivory team, he's taken the starch out of costume dramas and created an epic of beauty.  He also goes one step further than his cinematic colleagues and perfectly translates Wharton's writing on two important levels having key passages from the book directly narrated (in the most languid voice work) by Joanne Woodward, and visually translating Wharton's sentiments with his camera movements and Thelma Schoonmaker's skillful editing.The story centres on the life of Newland Archer (Day-Lewis), a young member of the New York gentry in the 1870s who has the affluent life anyone in his position should have.  He is a successful lawyer, he owns a beautiful home, and is just recently engaged to the beautiful and, ahem, proper May Welland (Ryder).  Upon announcing his engagement, he meets for the first time since childhood May's cousin, one Countess Olenska (Pfeiffer).  She has just returned from Europe after leaving her abusive husband, a Polish Count.It is soon obvious that Archer and Countess Olenska are attracted to each other in the most gripping of ways they understand each other.  This leads them to a passion that is practically deadly in the watchdog society they live in.From the beginning of the story, Scorsese makes sure we get to know who these people are.  Scanning over an opera audience's heads, he gives us close-ups of the ornaments in the women's hair, the chains on the men's ornate pocket watches.  When we are shown a dinner scene at a particular hosts' grand estate, Scorsese lingers over the perfectly arranged plates of food, or the meticulously designed floral bouquets.  All this may seem unnecessary, but it's actually the setup for a love story that needs this careful attention to detail to be told correctly.These elements are given to us in such detail because the world we're watching knows nothing of more importance than your house's interior decoration if your host doesn't have a proper drawing room decorated in the generally accepted fashion, he might be considered unfit for your patronage (at one point, the not-so-respectable Julius Beauford hangs a nude Venus, audaciously, in plain sight).  In her novel, Wharton painted a picture of two-dimensional people, people who wasted entire lives (and loves) on making sure they could avoid the careful whispers being spoken behind closed doors, even though it never stopped them from joining in on the whispering when someone else was involved.These details are comfortably housed in Dante Ferretti's brilliant production design.  The sets come from a beautiful dream, looming large over the actors' heads, surrounding them with the obsession of `conspicuous consumption' that heavily marked the Victorian period.  In the same way, Gabriella Pescucci's detailed costume designs display the plush fabrics and embroideries that reveal to the audience much of the characters' emotions and situations.  Even the stark black and white of the men's suits seem to suggest how these gentlemen view the issues they face in their lives, such as a nearly-married man involved romantically with his fiancee's cousin.  Archer's suits, as the film progresses, begin to be worn in the colour gray.Filling these costumes is no easy task.  For the three main characters in this battle of wills, Scorsese has hired none but the very best.  As Archer, Day-Lewis gives his most comprehensive performance so far.  Abandoning his usually ingratiating showy techniques, his performance lies in the suffering that we witness behind his eyes.  I so much prefer this role over his overstated innocent-prisoner turn in In The Name of the Father, which also came out the same year (and for which he received all the critical attention and award nominations); here he treads more along the same lines as his tenderhearted punk rocker in Stephen Frears' My Beautiful Laundrette.Michelle Pfeiffer is as sharp as a tack as Ellen Olenska, a woman who has seen it all and is still forced to suffer.  Looking at it from her point of view, the film is about a woman who is punished by society for being comfortable with herself.  From the outset we see she is different she doesn't speak shyly to men or wait for them to initiate conversation.  `Why would they start a new world only to make it exactly like the old one?' she asks Archer.  She smokes in front of Archer, is seen publicly being escorted places (quite innocently) with a married man (Wilson) who she doesn't want to go out with but feels obligated by family ties, and dares to attempt a divorce from her monster of a husband.  A woman who knows what she wants and goes for it? Demonic! She must be destroyed.  All New York shamelessly rallies together to eradicate this villain.Who better to lead the haughty fray than Olenska's own nemesis May Welland.  As May, Ryder is simply remarkable.  In her first scene she seems to us a complete nitwit a pretty and well-dressed girl, but one who pays no attention to the betterment of her mental faculties.  Ryder tears down that façade with burning relish.  She understands the character from the inside out, making May the most emotionally inspiring character in the whole movie (and the one that inspires the most conversation after viewing the film).  As the plot progresses, we start to understand how May really works; though she is intellectually unrefined, she's not in the least bit stupid.  She is Wharton's representation of the society Archer and Olenska are trapped in she plays by the rules like she invented them, and uses any device to make sure everything turns out her way, and it does.  She never comes out with what she wants to say, opting instead to turn passive-aggressive on her husband.   When she slips up on a story he's made up to get away from home to visit the Countess, May questions him like she has no idea what he's talking about.  `Oh never mind me, it's too complicated for me to understand,' she intimates with her large doe eyes and wan smile.  It comes as no surprise to me that Ryder wrote an essay on this character in high school and got an A for it.Wharton's message of doom is clear the one who plays along with the lie we've all helped to create is the one who succeeds.  May has her marriage, her children and a completely comfortable life.  Archer is caught into a plastic marriage and separated from the one person who ever makes him feel alive.  Olenska, feeling too threatened by those around her, is forced to make her home in Europe again, but far away from her husband.Who would have thought Scorsese could do it? Well, myself for starters.  Just because he's most famous for his gangster films doesn't mean that those are the only films he's capable of doing well.  With projects like After Hours, The Last Temptation of Christ and Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, Scorsese has shown his capability with a wide range of cinematic genres; why stop him at the period-drama threshold?  He drives the pace along with a slow but sure hand, never for a moment letting the film get carried away with itself.  Not to mention the atmosphere.  There are moments during this movie I just couldn't breathe.  No matter where in New York they go, Archer and the Countess are just never alone.  They might seem to be, but even the hand-sewn curtains seem to have eyes (those eyes are all photographed by Michael Ballhaus, the man also responsible for the gorgeous Bram Stoker's Dracula a year before, also starring Ryder).  The rooms with their overstuffed decorations and walls covered with numerous paintings loom over our protagonists with a close gaze; they're never trusted from the second they meet.Real love is the answer, but no one can ever dare ask the question.  Who knows what sadness Wharton knew to paint such a tormenting picture of true passion-between watching this and The Remains of the Day a week later, it's amazing I was able to leave my room for a year.  No one escapes this doom, Wharton says we either break the rules and are punished to death for it, or play by them and watch ourselves slowly perish on the inside.  We become less human and more drawings of humans; we become as hollow, or shall we say `innocent', as the age around us.

He also goes one step further than his cinematic colleagues and perfectly translates Wharton's writing on two important levels having key passages from the book directly narrated (in the most languid voice work) by Joanne Woodward, and visually translating Wharton's sentiments with his camera movements and Thelma Schoonmaker's skillful editing.The story centres on the life of Newland Archer (Day-Lewis), a young member of the New York gentry in the 1870s who has the affluent life anyone in his position should have.  He is a successful lawyer, he owns a beautiful home, and is just recently engaged to the beautiful and, ahem, proper May Welland (Ryder).  Upon announcing his engagement, he meets for the first time since childhood May's cousin, one Countess Olenska (Pfeiffer).  She has just returned from Europe after leaving her abusive husband, a Polish Count.It is soon obvious that Archer and Countess Olenska are attracted to each other in the most gripping of ways they understand each other.  This leads them to a passion that is practically deadly in the watchdog society they live in.From the beginning of the story, Scorsese makes sure we get to know who these people are.  Scanning over an opera audience's heads, he gives us close-ups of the ornaments in the women's hair, the chains on the men's ornate pocket watches.  When we are shown a dinner scene at a particular hosts' grand estate, Scorsese lingers over the perfectly arranged plates of food, or the meticulously designed floral bouquets.  All this may seem unnecessary, but it's actually the setup for a love story that needs this careful attention to detail to be told correctly.These elements are given to us in such detail because the world we're watching knows nothing of more importance than your house's interior decoration if your host doesn't have a proper drawing room decorated in the generally accepted fashion, he might be considered unfit for your patronage (at one point, the not-so-respectable Julius Beauford hangs a nude Venus, audaciously, in plain sight).  In her novel, Wharton painted a picture of two-dimensional people, people who wasted entire lives (and loves) on making sure they could avoid the careful whispers being spoken behind closed doors, even though it never stopped them from joining in on the whispering when someone else was involved.These details are comfortably housed in Dante Ferretti's brilliant production design.  The sets come from a beautiful dream, looming large over the actors' heads, surrounding them with the obsession of `conspicuous consumption' that heavily marked the Victorian period.  In the same way, Gabriella Pescucci's detailed costume designs display the plush fabrics and embroideries that reveal to the audience much of the characters' emotions and situations.  Even the stark black and white of the men's suits seem to suggest how these gentlemen view the issues they face in their lives, such as a nearly-married man involved romantically with his fiancee's cousin.  Archer's suits, as the film progresses, begin to be worn in the colour gray.Filling these costumes is no easy task.  For the three main characters in this battle of wills, Scorsese has hired none but the very best.  As Archer, Day-Lewis gives his most comprehensive performance so far.  Abandoning his usually ingratiating showy techniques, his performance lies in the suffering that we witness behind his eyes.  I so much prefer this role over his overstated innocent-prisoner turn in In The Name of the Father, which also came out the same year (and for which he received all the critical attention and award nominations); here he treads more along the same lines as his tenderhearted punk rocker in Stephen Frears' My Beautiful Laundrette.Michelle Pfeiffer is as sharp as a tack as Ellen Olenska, a woman who has seen it all and is still forced to suffer.  Looking at it from her point of view, the film is about a woman who is punished by society for being comfortable with herself.  From the outset we see she is different she doesn't speak shyly to men or wait for them to initiate conversation.  `Why would they start a new world only to make it exactly like the old one?' she asks Archer.  She smokes in front of Archer, is seen publicly being escorted places (quite innocently) with a married man (Wilson) who she doesn't want to go out with but feels obligated by family ties, and dares to attempt a divorce from her monster of a husband.  A woman who knows what she wants and goes for it? Demonic! She must be destroyed.  All New York shamelessly rallies together to eradicate this villain.Who better to lead the haughty fray than Olenska's own nemesis May Welland.  As May, Ryder is simply remarkable.  In her first scene she seems to us a complete nitwit a pretty and well-dressed girl, but one who pays no attention to the betterment of her mental faculties.  Ryder tears down that façade with burning relish.  She understands the character from the inside out, making May the most emotionally inspiring character in the whole movie (and the one that inspires the most conversation after viewing the film).  As the plot progresses, we start to understand how May really works; though she is intellectually unrefined, she's not in the least bit stupid.  She is Wharton's representation of the society Archer and Olenska are trapped in she plays by the rules like she invented them, and uses any device to make sure everything turns out her way, and it does.  She never comes out with what she wants to say, opting instead to turn passive-aggressive on her husband.   When she slips up on a story he's made up to get away from home to visit the Countess, May questions him like she has no idea what he's talking about.  `Oh never mind me, it's too complicated for me to understand,' she intimates with her large doe eyes and wan smile.  It comes as no surprise to me that Ryder wrote an essay on this character in high school and got an A for it.Wharton's message of doom is clear the one who plays along with the lie we've all helped to create is the one who succeeds.  May has her marriage, her children and a completely comfortable life.  Archer is caught into a plastic marriage and separated from the one person who ever makes him feel alive.  Olenska, feeling too threatened by those around her, is forced to make her home in Europe again, but far away from her husband.Who would have thought Scorsese could do it? Well, myself for starters.  Just because he's most famous for his gangster films doesn't mean that those are the only films he's capable of doing well.  With projects like After Hours, The Last Temptation of Christ and Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, Scorsese has shown his capability with a wide range of cinematic genres; why stop him at the period-drama threshold?  He drives the pace along with a slow but sure hand, never for a moment letting the film get carried away with itself.  Not to mention the atmosphere.  There are moments during this movie I just couldn't breathe.  No matter where in New York they go, Archer and the Countess are just never alone.  They might seem to be, but even the hand-sewn curtains seem to have eyes (those eyes are all photographed by Michael Ballhaus, the man also responsible for the gorgeous Bram Stoker's Dracula a year before, also starring Ryder).  The rooms with their overstuffed decorations and walls covered with numerous paintings loom over our protagonists with a close gaze; they're never trusted from the second they meet.Real love is the answer, but no one can ever dare ask the question.  Who knows what sadness Wharton knew to paint such a tormenting picture of true passion-between watching this and The Remains of the Day a week later, it's amazing I was able to leave my room for a year.  No one escapes this doom, Wharton says we either break the rules and are punished to death for it, or play by them and watch ourselves slowly perish on the inside.  We become less human and more drawings of humans; we become as hollow, or shall we say `innocent', as the age around us.

On the other hand, I can never help but weep at the end.  Perhaps it's something to do with self-hatred, but I love hating this film.Deborah Kerr plays a young woman engaged to be married to a wealthy New York businessman, who is thwarted in love on an ocean liner traveling from Europe to the Big Apple when she meets world-class playboy Cary Grant.  They fall in love, partly because Kerr is the only woman who doesn't fall flat on her back when she sees Grant, which to him I suppose signifies challenge.  Unfortunately, Grant is too famous, and so their romance must be kept a secret so that neither of their fiancees find out.Eventually they reach harbour and decide to meet after six months, to see if they really do want to be together.  They even pick a romantic meeting spot the top of the Empire State Building (those of you who are thinking, Wow that's just like Sleepless In Seattle, well you're right, but backwards).  But lo and behold it is not to be, for Debs doesn't notice the taxi cab coming straight at her the day of the great rendezvous and she gets pummeled to the ground.  This is where it really gets bad.Now she's a handicapped teacher for underprivileged children in the inner city, and Grant is a penniless painter.  There's a scene where they see each other at the ballet and don't say much.  Then there's a sappy, pat happy ending that is all Hollywood and makes me want to throw up (after I dry my eyes).That it's a remake of Love Affair is one thing, but that it was remade by the same director is quite astonishing to me.  His intent was to not only remake the film in colour (disgusting, overly bright colour which was the fashion for CinemaScope romances in those days), but to extend the film in length as well.  All his extensions are unnecessary, from a longer waving sequence on the cruise ship when the stars have landed in New York, to a horribly dull musical number involving Kerr's students (the part where the only two African-American children in the class break out dancing always makes me want to scream).  There's also a scene where Kerr sings the title song (dubbed by Marni Nixon, who the year before had filled in for Kerr's singing voice in The King and I.The only part that I really adore (and which is my favourite aspect of any version of this story), is when Grant takes Kerr on a trip to the coast of France to visit his widowed grandmother (Cathleen Nesbitt-Maria Ouspenskaya in the original 1939 version, Katharine Hepburn in the 1994 version where the scene took place on a South sea island instead of France).  In this sequence the sentiment is pliable, tender and very touching, partly because it involves Kerr.  It's a testament to her profound powers as an actress that she can take a character who could potentially be a complete ninny and make her a vibrant and passionate woman who maintains her stately poise without compromising the fire within her.

It's a testament to her profound powers as an actress that she can take a character who could potentially be a complete ninny and make her a vibrant and passionate woman who maintains her stately poise without compromising the fire within her.  I love this about her in every film I've seen her in (and consequently have had the pleasure of falling in love with her time and time again).  The ting with the scarf never fails to get me choking.All in all it's a film so purple it's scary, but it seems to deserve its status as the most famous romance film from its time.  It has all the trappings it needs tragic story, beautiful actors, full-throated monologues, and not a hint of believability.  If you have the patience, grab a Kleenex box and dive on in.

Therefore, the boy wandering in the movie was strange, but it did not bother with the story.  Now that I have seen this opening scene, I can say that it did not have a great effect.The opening scene features a child who plays violence with his toys while wearing a bag over his head.  The play is very excessive, and seems to be way over-the-top.  I have never seen a child play like that with his toys, and most would probably say that he was ADD right on the spot.  It did not help the film, even though I understood what it was supposed to mean.  The film could have stood to be without it.The rest of the movie is still breathtaking, and awesome.  Shakespeare was a vicious man with a brutal sense of humor, in his plays.  The movie retains the brutality and viciousness of the movie, and emphasizes the humor in the play.  The dialogue was kept the same as in the play, and it was surprising. The modern slang, probably not its origins, in the movie and play were funny then, and still funny now.The movie also realized the meaning of the play.

But the acting, I think, was terrific. I don't have no experience in acting, still I can't believe how people can consider this terrible! Maybe they've only  seen two movies (ever), and the other one must have been very good indeed!I specially liked Jeremy Irons, and really understood his character, someone who crawled up the social ladder with very hard work, then fights against those who would take his life's work from him, only he gets so involved in this fight, he doesn't realize reason is no longer at his side, and he ends up a beaten, disappointed man. Irons made this so believable, I sympathized with the character despite his brutality.After Jeremy Irons, Winona Ryder is also wonderful as a romantic young women, who is drawn into the revolutionary ideals by her boyfriend (Banderas, he had an under-developed part, I think), and Glenn Close was also very good. Meryl Streep had an average performance, it was not bad, just not up to the standards of the other actors. Watch out for Miguel Guilherme, a fine Portuguese actor, between so many stars.In contrast to today's movies, here only the interpretations, only people matter, but at the same time, it is not a pretensious film, too worried trying to be intellectual.

The major flaw I spotted was historical detail, with several cars, trains, clothes, etc. I think don´t belong at that time.***Possible spoiler*****The technical aspect of the film is ok, nothing to brag about. But the acting, I think, was terrific. I don't have no experience in acting, still I can't believe how people can consider this terrible! Maybe they've only  seen two movies (ever), and the other one must have been very good indeed!I specially liked Jeremy Irons, and really understood his character, someone who crawled up the social ladder with very hard work, then fights against those who would take his life's work from him, only he gets so involved in this fight, he doesn't realize reason is no longer at his side, and he ends up a beaten, disappointed man. Irons made this so believable, I sympathized with the character despite his brutality.After Jeremy Irons, Winona Ryder is also wonderful as a romantic young women, who is drawn into the revolutionary ideals by her boyfriend (Banderas, he had an under-developed part, I think), and Glenn Close was also very good. Meryl Streep had an average performance, it was not bad, just not up to the standards of the other actors. Watch out for Miguel Guilherme, a fine Portuguese actor, between so many stars.In contrast to today's movies, here only the interpretations, only people matter, but at the same time, it is not a pretensious film, too worried trying to be intellectual.

The script is well written and has great one-liners. The cast is incredibly funny; Kevin Kline as a man who discovers his homosexuality, Joan Cusack (who seems to be able to play any character) as his terrible fiancee, Tom Selleck as the love interest and Matt Dillon as a parody on those many Hollywood studs are all wonderful. This movie is light, pleasing and has also the message of tolerance in it 2 thumbs up!
