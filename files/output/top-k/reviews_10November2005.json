This intense psychological thriller is genuinely shocking and shows the audience what lunacy does to people whilst at the same time, luring the audience in to a journey of fear that can not be escaped.What makes Misery so memorable is Kathy Bates portrayal of Anne Wilkes which is one of the most memorable performances of the decade. Wilkes is such a complex character; her apparent motherly nature is greatly complimented by her obsessive behaviour towards Caan. It is this obsessive nature that gives the first clue she is psychopathic. When her psychopathic behaviour dominates her personality is when the film really starts to become something special. Her constant outburst are often surprising and her body language shows more than her lines, just how on edge she is. Although not in the same league as Bates, James Caan is a great choice for Paul Sheldon. As an actor who often plays very physical, tough guy roles, his frustration at being bed ridden and chair bound comes across very well in his character and his shock and fear mirror exactly how the audience feel.The infamous 'hobbling' scene is a particularly gruesome scene and will be shown on television for many years to come. The lack of discreteness makes it so real to watch and you really feel the pain when you see it. When the plot unravels on Wilkes' character and her background is explained, the film becomes even more disturbing and shows that Caan is in more trouble than he ever imagined.With Bates' performance stealing the show and the fact it is one of Stephen King's better novels, Misery is a contemporary classic that has more than enough thrills and chills to keep audiences satisfied.

The plot concerning a young English aristocrat initially set in Elizabethan times charts how the character longs for love and companionship falls for a Russian girl who toys with his feelings and ultimately breaks his heart. Queen Elizabeth offers him a house and land if he can remain young and not wither away. Miraculously Orlando does not age at all and remains young (However the reason for this is not explained). He is given an then ambassador post in the East, forms a friendship with the ruler and gives them weapons to fight of a mutual enemy. He returns to England and falls into a long sleep and awakes as a female (yes really)and whilst out horse riding falls off her horse and amazingly along comes Billy Zane and the same thing happens to him they immediately feel something towards each other and return to Orlando's house and make love. He is a free spirit and ultimately returns to America. Then we quickly are rushed through the World Wars to the present day London where she has passed her writings to a publisher in the Docklands and we see her and her child riding off back to the House she owned for centuries. I have probably left a few things out. But then I felt there was a lot of emotional depth missing from this film. I did not for once find Tilda Swinton believable as a man in the beginning of the film. Even when Orlando changes sex I did not find her acting to be of the required emotional depth, although the script was probably partly to blame for this. I found some of the dialogue to be quite trite in places. And even though the story of Orlando could have been interesting this 90 minute film seemed like it was well over 2hrs. As another reviewer has stated, the character passes through these times but there is no real connection, you do not find out a great deal about the periods and what life was like as the film concentrates more on Orlando's emotional quest. Also I am not really a fan of movies where the protagonist often makes asides to the camera, in most cases it is not essential to the plot and adds nothing to the film.I would give this film 3.5 out of 10. It is not worth the time, unless you are a fan of Virginia Woolf's writing or interested in feminist movies, but even then there has been better. If you want to see a much better Tilda Swinton film I highly recommend you check out a 2001 movie called The Deep End she co-stars with Goran Visnjic.

He just needed to be emotionally fulfilled, it brings a tear to my eye every time I see it. Man...I'm so lonely.Actually this is one of the most divisive Bonds, it made a lot of money, over $200 million when the average price of a movie ticket was less than $3. But the reason for that has been hotly debated. Some think that since the late-1970's were the hey-day of sci-fi spectacles, people were just continuing the fad, which coupled with the mere fact that it was a Bond picture (none of which have ever lost money in theaters) kept people coming to the theaters. Others think it is a really good movie. I take a somewhat middle of the road stance.As far as action and sci-fi films go, this is the top of the line, better than anything to be brought forth by most of the action stars of the 80's and 90's (yet strangely nobody ever lists Roger Moore among the action heroes). As a Bond film, it's far from the worst. Not the best film in the series, and I have seen them all, but somewhere in the middle. Roger Moore is my favorite James Bond, reputed to be Ian Flemmings original choice for the role, he had to wait ten years to get his shot, oh well the time brought forth a great experienced Bond. As the oldest Bond (oldest at time of casting and at time of final appearance), Moore had a certain quality that I always liked even when I started watching Bond films at the tender age of five-which incidentally was A View to a Kill, another Moore film-I guess he is just my Bond. The things that make a bond film work are here, the gadgets are in force. Q is around with some of the best witty banter. Miss MoneyPenny is in fine form-dang Lois Maxwell was hot. Drax, our main villain, seems to have put some real planning into his plot for world domination. He has armies of people who are ready to put it into motion, not just cannon fodder for when Bond starts to ruin the bad guy's plan. Very much of it's day, the film is a little dated when you consider the space shuttle is about to be retired in the real world, but there hasn't been a Bond film that doesn't get dated after a while, no biggie. Everything works, we were used to high tech cars and boat chases, the production staff threw us for a loop with a high tech boat chase. You know they're thinking when they combine the nest elements from the previous films without making it look stupid or insulting to our intelligence.And then there is the relationship between Jaws and Dolly, although a pretty minor subplot of the context of the film, it was just so remarkably handled. The actors took what in the script was maybe a half a paragraph total of direction and dialog and made it the most memorable thing to ever enter into the movie. I know I am making a big deal out of it, but, if you don't think it's a big deal, then you really missed the movie. I pity you for that. But if you see what it really is, the greatness of it, then there's hope for you. The 180 Jaws brought about in Jaws by this young lady (called Dolly) is astounding. Odd-job (GoldFinger), Grant(FRWL), and Stamper (TND) are all big henchmen who wouldn't possibly do such a thing in a convincing way. Maybe someday in a future Bond film, we'll see Jaws and Dolly again, married with two or three kids, bump into Bond, maybe invite him to a BBQ or just say hi.

The neighbor goes on and on about how great Joan Crawford is, and how she and her daughter would love to meet her. Bette Davis replies- My sister is not fit to receive visitors and never leaves the house. She then sends the neighbor away.She goes upstairs to bring her invalid sister her breakfast. She hears Joan Crawford watching one of her old movies on TV. Just before she enters the room she says- Enjoying yourself? Oh why yes Joan Crawford replies. Bette Davis walks to the TV and then hits the off button. Joan Crawford jolts-I was watching that. Bette Davis turns and jolts back with jealousy- THEN YOU'RE AN IDIOT! That sets the whole mood for the film. You'll find yourself laughing and falling off the couch.This movie ROCKS! It is so ahead of it's time. It is quite controversial in my opinion. Even to this day. It deals with issues of codependency, toxic relationships, fame, reputation, female power struggles, addiction, alcoholism, denial, insecurity and redemption. You name it this film has it. I really have to give the women in this film A lot of credit. No woman in Hollywood today would ever allow themselves to be filmed so unattractively. I know Charlize Theron did for Monster. I'm talking about older actresses.It was very, very bold of Bette Davis to be filmed in such bad lighting and such hideous makeup. She allowed every crag, wrinkle and bag to be seen. And quite closeup I might add. That takes some real balls to do that. Hell, not even male actors nowadays would allow that. This movie is a frightening portrayal of what happens to the ego once it collapses. All she has left are her distant memories of her heyday, and now those are not even enough to keep her afloat. So what does she do? Drowns herself in booze and tries to drag everybody down with her. This movie is tragic, funny and frightening all at the same time.I think we all see Baby Janes in our society nowadays. Ehhh emmm, can anyone say Michael Jackson, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Liz Taylor? And I'm sure we'll see plenty more to come in the future. Madonna, Britney Spears, Courtney Love. Now those are gonna be some really frightening Baby Janes. Madonna is almost there! Perhaps one day when Lidsay Lohan and Hilary Duff are old they'll be confined to a house together left to destroy each other. Only if there's a God. LOL!

A neighbor comes by who had watched one of her old movies the night before on TV. She brings flowers to the back door. Bette Davis answers looking like a real bitch. The neighbor goes on and on about how great Joan Crawford is, and how she and her daughter would love to meet her. Bette Davis replies- My sister is not fit to receive visitors and never leaves the house. She then sends the neighbor away.She goes upstairs to bring her invalid sister her breakfast. She hears Joan Crawford watching one of her old movies on TV. Just before she enters the room she says- Enjoying yourself? Oh why yes Joan Crawford replies. Bette Davis walks to the TV and then hits the off button. Joan Crawford jolts-I was watching that. Bette Davis turns and jolts back with jealousy- THEN YOU'RE AN IDIOT! That sets the whole mood for the film. You'll find yourself laughing and falling off the couch.This movie ROCKS! It is so ahead of it's time. It is quite controversial in my opinion. Even to this day. It deals with issues of codependency, toxic relationships, fame, reputation, female power struggles, addiction, alcoholism, denial, insecurity and redemption. You name it this film has it. I really have to give the women in this film A lot of credit. No woman in Hollywood today would ever allow themselves to be filmed so unattractively. I know Charlize Theron did for Monster. I'm talking about older actresses.It was very, very bold of Bette Davis to be filmed in such bad lighting and such hideous makeup. She allowed every crag, wrinkle and bag to be seen. And quite closeup I might add. That takes some real balls to do that. Hell, not even male actors nowadays would allow that. This movie is a frightening portrayal of what happens to the ego once it collapses. All she has left are her distant memories of her heyday, and now those are not even enough to keep her afloat. So what does she do? Drowns herself in booze and tries to drag everybody down with her. This movie is tragic, funny and frightening all at the same time.I think we all see Baby Janes in our society nowadays. Ehhh emmm, can anyone say Michael Jackson, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Liz Taylor? And I'm sure we'll see plenty more to come in the future. Madonna, Britney Spears, Courtney Love. Now those are gonna be some really frightening Baby Janes. Madonna is almost there! Perhaps one day when Lidsay Lohan and Hilary Duff are old they'll be confined to a house together left to destroy each other. Only if there's a God. LOL! Then we will all finally be vindicated.I highly recommend this movie. It will freak you out.

Good idea? Sure, it doesn't sound too promising, but trust me-it is! The film starts out with Tom Hank's wonderful performance of Forrest Gump. He sits on a bench telling his about his life to people that will listen. What exactly is his life? Forrest has lived a dramatic, passionate life full of love, romance and laughs.Forrest Gump plays out in chronological order. We start out in his childhood, which Forrest lives through without a father. When he goes to school, he meets Jenny, the girl he is destined to fall in love with. The childhood is a bit embarrassing- the kids are all very odd, but luckily, that is soon over when Forrest goes to high school. He is picked on for his low IQ, and only Jenny sticks up for him. When the kids throw rocks at him, he runs. And thus, one of the most famous lines in Cinema History Run Forrest, run! So, Forrest lives through life, often meeting historical figures, which are seen through Forrest's eyes. (The tag line is Your world will never be the same, once you've looked through the eyes of Forrest Gump.) Meanwhile, Jenny goes in her own direction, having boyfriends, becoming a hippie, prostituting, and much more.Through the thirty years Forrest lives, only a few moments are spent with Jenny. Because of this, those moments are the sweetest moments of them all. Well, they might be. There are so many moments; it's hard to pinpoint just one.I know this film has some flaws such as some gross jokes, and embarrassing moments. I cannot deny these flaws, but I also cannot deny the warmth that was in my heart after the movie was over. The acting, witty humor, drama, creativity and romance will do noting less than put a smile on your face.10\/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.

It appeals to intellectuals and it appeals to non-intellectuals. It's fun to watch, the special effects blew me away as a kid and still hold up today, looking better and more real than anything George Lucas has made in the past few years. If you don't enjoy yourself it's probably because you have a dislike of violence--and this movie has to be one of the most violent things I have ever seen--or because the dialogue is so childish, campy, and vacuous that you feel as if your brain is being sucked out by a gigantic termite.On the other hand...It's a satire. It puts on display the ideal right-wing society, and all the hilarious brainlessness thereof. Authority is never questioned. Leaders are always correct. You don't matter unless you're a warrior. The enemy is a faceless, writhing mass of animals--no, insects--that must be destroyed at all costs. Everyone is remarkably beautiful, but at the same time every character's mind is so malnourished and so filled with state propaganda that no one has anything of any importance to say. The human mind has become so frail that soldiers go into combat without any kind of strategy--beyond kill them all!--regularly break formation, wear useless armor and carry weapons that are practically useless, rarely if ever have any kind of effective support in the form of cavalry or artillery, and always fly their ships as close together as possible even though they know that in doing so they are easier targets for the bugs--who do have artillery--and that they will inevitably crash into each other. It's a prophetic film, with it's own Pearl Harbor\/911 moment, its own terrorists who hate freedom and are most certainly not defending themselves from a foreign invasion of their own lands--compare the U.S-backed regime in Saudi Arabia to Fort Ticonderoga in the movie, deep in the Bug Quarantine Zone--and with plenty of its own blind patriotism. The difference, however, between the film and the modern age is that the Starship Troopers win, as they have the intelligence to fight an actual enemy rather than the concept of terrorism, like us. The metaphor isn't perfect, though, since the Starship Troopers don't feel the need to occupy Klendathu and civilize--pardon me, democratize--the bugs. Beyond that, the sound, music, and cinematography is solid, never getting in the way of telling a violent, satirical adventure. The love story is stupid, as is really every relationship in the movie, but that's because this is the right-wing paradise, where everyone is a little brainless cog too busy making babies or killing bugs to think of anything interesting. The film is about as similar to the book as The Wrath of Khan is to Moby Dick, but that doesn't detract from the immense pleasure I feel in watching it. I laugh, I cringe, I think I am entertained. Star Wars was obviously a huge influence. My only complaint has to do with the plot the siege in the middle of the movie is really the high point, and should actually go at the end. It was simply too incredible to be topped. And as an aside, they don't really explain how bug plasma could shoot an asteroid across the entire galaxy in what seems like a matter of a few weeks at most, which leads me to believe that the whole reason for fighting--the destruction of Buenos Aires--was faked by the Federation itself, but who knows?

It may look weak in comparison to A Hard Day's Night, widely regarded as the Citizen Kane of rock musicals. But it's an easier film for a kid to relate to. Instead of a realistic, ironic mockumentary about the lives of rock stars, it's a harmless escapist fantasy that has precious little to do with the real Beatles. These are the Beatles of myth, the four asexual men who all live in the same house, which is supposed to pass for an automated futuristic type of home, at least to audiences in the 1960s. I suppose that as a kid I got a kick out of the idea of having a vending machine in one's own home. Somehow, I never asked myself what the advantage of that would be, and the film never does, either.Looking back on the film as an adult, I have a hard time determining what it is I liked about it. Certainly, I can't remember laughing at any of the jokes. In fact, I was vaguely aware that most of the jokes fall flat. (In contrast, the Monkees' TV show, modeled heavily on this movie, was often quite funny.) The superintendent who does a bad Cagney imitation and inexplicably begins every sentence with the words So this is the famous.... left me staring at the screen blankly. This is quintessential British humor, revolving heavily around people's nonchalant reactions to bizarre events. It's a brand of humor that has great potential to be funny; here, it's just strange, probably because none of the ideas are all that inspired. The idea of a tiger who likes Beethoven might have sounded good on paper, I suppose, but it doesn't come together on screen. I suppose it could have been used as the setup for a funnier joke; instead, it's used as the punchline. At least I was able to get that joke when I was a kid. Many of the other jokes involve references that went over my head, such as the line It's the brain drain his brain's draining. Those sophisticated enough to know what the brain drain is are likely to be too old to appreciate such a pedestrian pun.The Beatles themselves do not emerge in this film as talented comic actors, to put it mildly. Their line readings are wooden, their comic timing is off, and their apparent attempts at improvisation are pathetic, as in their continual ho ho hoing throughout the film. The Beatles were supposed to have been very funny on stage and in interviews, but none of that ability translates to the screen. It may not have been their fault. The characters they play are given no identifiable traits, and as a result they come off as interchangeable, except for Ringo because of his role in the plot. Instead of giving them distinct comic personas to play, the film turns them into straight-men who are the victims of a zany, insane world that's conspiring against them. This is presumably what led the real Beatles to complain that the film reduced them to extras in (their) own movie.So why do I have so much affection for the film? Probably because I was just sort of enchanted by the events. The movie has a lot of the types of scenes that delight kids, like the aforementioned automated house, as well as a ton of weird gadgets. The various methods in which the Beatles attempt to remove the dreaded ring from Ringo's finger is the best aspect of the film, plot-wise. It may not make me laugh, but there still is a certain pleasure in watching these scenes. Besides, I've always liked movies about Thuggees.

Temple of Doom at least alludes to that fact, and bases its plot on the premise that the cult has secretly survived.

It actually has a better soundtrack, in my opinion, than A Hard Day's Night. Among the songs that Help! popularized are not just the hits like You're Gonna Lose That Girl, Ticket to Ride, You've Got to Hide Your Love, and the title song, but also lesser known tracks like The Night Before and Another Girl. The earlier film appropriately focused on their dance music. The songs from this film have a greater focus on harmony and musical virtuosity.

It may look weak in comparison to A Hard Day's Night, widely regarded as the Citizen Kane of rock musicals. But it's an easier film for a kid to relate to. Instead of a realistic, ironic mockumentary about the lives of rock stars, it's a harmless escapist fantasy that has precious little to do with the real Beatles. These are the Beatles of myth, the four asexual men who all live in the same house, which is supposed to pass for an automated futuristic type of home, at least to audiences in the 1960s. I suppose that as a kid I got a kick out of the idea of having a vending machine in one's own home. Somehow, I never asked myself what the advantage of that would be, and the film never does, either.Looking back on the film as an adult, I have a hard time determining what it is I liked about it. Certainly, I can't remember laughing at any of the jokes. In fact, I was vaguely aware that most of the jokes fall flat. (In contrast, the Monkees' TV show, modeled heavily on this movie, was often quite funny.) The superintendent who does a bad Cagney imitation and inexplicably begins every sentence with the words So this is the famous.... left me staring at the screen blankly. This is quintessential British humor, revolving heavily around people's nonchalant reactions to bizarre events. It's a brand of humor that has great potential to be funny; here, it's just strange, probably because none of the ideas are all that inspired. The idea of a tiger who likes Beethoven might have sounded good on paper, I suppose, but it doesn't come together on screen. I suppose it could have been used as the setup for a funnier joke; instead, it's used as the punchline. At least I was able to get that joke when I was a kid. Many of the other jokes involve references that went over my head, such as the line It's the brain drain his brain's draining. Those sophisticated enough to know what the brain drain is are likely to be too old to appreciate such a pedestrian pun.The Beatles themselves do not emerge in this film as talented comic actors, to put it mildly. Their line readings are wooden, their comic timing is off, and their apparent attempts at improvisation are pathetic, as in their continual ho ho hoing throughout the film. The Beatles were supposed to have been very funny on stage and in interviews, but none of that ability translates to the screen. It may not have been their fault. The characters they play are given no identifiable traits, and as a result they come off as interchangeable, except for Ringo because of his role in the plot. Instead of giving them distinct comic personas to play, the film turns them into straight-men who are the victims of a zany, insane world that's conspiring against them. This is presumably what led the real Beatles to complain that the film reduced them to extras in (their) own movie.So why do I have so much affection for the film? Probably because I was just sort of enchanted by the events. The movie has a lot of the types of scenes that delight kids, like the aforementioned automated house, as well as a ton of weird gadgets.

I even like films that are bad enough to be accidentally entertaining. Whether the battle scenes are believable is something I leave to others, but The Messenger is neither of the other two. It is a mishmash of scenes with little, if any, focus. It takes itself far too seriously for the viewer to extract any fun out of it. Above all else, it features a cast vying so hard for an Oscar that it becomes painful. Milla's performances in the Resident Evil films were more appealing than as the seventeen year old rebel leader who forever changed the history of France. Not that I find France a particularly interesting subject in the first place, but France deserves a lot better than this. I must concur with most of the critics in this instance that Hollywood's desire to grind the histories of every country, even America's, into five-minute-noodle-like chunks has grown out of control. You do not expect complete truth in any historical epic, but come on.To those who claim that this is yet another attempt by Hollywood to demonise Christians, I have one word to say suckers. Films that demonise Christians exist solely so you can whine about it. Speaking as an Aspie (a member of a minority group that was slandered to hell and back recently in Law & Order Trial By Jury), your crocodile tears are wasted on me. While Joan's fanaticism is all over the place in this film, the most scarily accurate portrayals are those of the Church figures drafted by both governments to put Joan out of their misery. Anyone who wants a kindergarten version of why the trial by jury system was invented would do well to observe these scenes. Contrary to what some critics might tell you, these instances of verdicts being decided before the trial begins are quite common in societies where Church and State have intermingled. So kudos to Luc Besson for getting that part right.Unfortunately, the rest of the film is an unholy mess. Milla Jojovich is badly miscast as J'eanne, the girl who would lead an army to take back a small plot of land. She is about as French as I am, and there is no effort on the part of makeup artists, dialogue coaches, or even screenwriters, to hide the fact. Although faint tinges of her original Ukranian mode of speech remain, she sounds so American that half the time when she is addressing Richard Ridings' La Hire (one of the few well-cast roles in the film), you half expect her to ask him if he wants fries with that. In spite of having a mere fraction of the screen time, Tchéky Karyo and John Malkovich act rings around Jojovich. Put them in a girly suit and give them a sword, I am sure they would make a far better J'eanne. Their dramatic range is far wider, for one thing. Roger Ebert hit the nail on the head when he said that this film labors under the misapprehension that Joan's life is a war story and takes place largely on battlefields.When The Messenger is on the battlefield, it manages to remain interesting for about half of a scene length. The tactics used in one major siege sequence are even amusing. The problem is that when Besson tries to do anything besides an action sequence, it does not work. After the umpteenth shot of Milla acting all bug-eyed for the camera while an array of stupid visual effects surround her, you are just waiting for Joan to be defeated so this mess can finish already. Not content to be incomprehensible while Joan is fighting or developing her reasons to fight, however, Besson insisted in including scenes with Dustin Hoffman where he constantly tells her what an idiot she is, or something along those lines. It always amuses me when people whine about Joan being portrayed as if she is insane. She was a seventeen year old girl who felt so strongly that she had to go to war that it impressed veterans in the French army. That, and statistics, pretty much convince me that she was. Religion had nothing to do with her marching into the hundred years war. No film, no matter how much it crows at me that the Church is awesome (the same Church that burned her at the behest of the government?), is going to convince me otherwise.I gave The Messenger a two out of ten.

It takes you back to another place and time, the Frontier, to a place that you wish still existed. The movie has excellent actors-Rodney A. Grant, Graham Greene, Wes Studi and so many more. I loved the beautiful scenes of the endless prairie, of the Lakota Sioux camp, and the wonderful music of John Barry. The story centers around the life of Liutenant John Dunbar, and his trek of self discovery. In the beginning we see him as a disillusioned Union soldier, lying wounded in the surgeons camp bed. He attempts to take his life, but instead ends up saving the day. He is promoted and given the opportunity to leave the fighting grounds of the Civil War for the posting of his choosing. He chooses to be posted in the Frontier, in order to see it before it is gone. Once he arrives at the camp, he finds out it is deserted. He remains there, alone, hopeful that new troops arrive soon. Yet they never do. He finds out that he alone must learn to live in an environment he knows nothing about. Then he makes contact with a Sioux, and several times they try to steal his horse, Cisco. The movie, to me, begins really when he travels to the Lakota Sioux campsite, to make contact. It is here that a relationship with the Sioux really begins, as well as Dunbar's relationship with Kicking Bird. Gradually, John Dunbar realizes that the Sioux are not the way he envisioned them. He had had preconceived notions about them-about all Native Americans, to be exact. He finds himself identifying with them, with their way of life and beliefs. Eventually he comes into contact with his own former world, the world he left behind. He finds out that he no longer identifies with his former comrades or with the US government.

He attempts to take his life, but instead ends up saving the day. He is promoted and given the opportunity to leave the fighting grounds of the Civil War for the posting of his choosing. He chooses to be posted in the Frontier, in order to see it before it is gone. Once he arrives at the camp, he finds out it is deserted. He remains there, alone, hopeful that new troops arrive soon. Yet they never do. He finds out that he alone must learn to live in an environment he knows nothing about. Then he makes contact with a Sioux, and several times they try to steal his horse, Cisco. The movie, to me, begins really when he travels to the Lakota Sioux campsite, to make contact. It is here that a relationship with the Sioux really begins, as well as Dunbar's relationship with Kicking Bird. Gradually, John Dunbar realizes that the Sioux are not the way he envisioned them. He had had preconceived notions about them-about all Native Americans, to be exact. He finds himself identifying with them, with their way of life and beliefs. Eventually he comes into contact with his own former world, the world he left behind. He finds out that he no longer identifies with his former comrades or with the US government. It is then that John Dunbar discovers just how far he is willing to go to protect his new adopted family-the family he learned to love. I deeply recommend Dances With Wolves. It is timeless.

They are both to be commended for their genius.This is an extraordinary film, perfect in every way (apart from a couple of minor glitches I noticed, not worth mentioning).I particularly like the way Aronofsky has cameo appearances by Selby (prison guard in kitchen), his father Abraham (man on train in hat), and James Chinlund (long-haired man on train). Similarly he had Clint Mansell in 'Pi' as a student photographer.I also like the reuse of particular actors between the two films - Sean Gullette, Samia Shoaib and Ben Shenkman especially.There are so many aspects to this story - a snapshot of ordinary lives, interactions between mother and son, a relationship turning sour, a friendship stretched to breaking point, the quality of life ultimately destroyed.In my opinion, only Tyrone really survives, even though his final scene shows him on a prison cot, suffering withdrawal symptoms. It seemed to me he never became as deeply addicted as Marion or Harry, and was able to exercise some control over his habit. So even though he's in prison, he's still alive and relatively sane, compared to the main other characters.Sara has a nirvana of sorts at the end - although her brain is fried. In this state she can live completely within her head. Being in hospital means she's cared for in the basic ways - food, shelter, hygiene - and can concentrate on herself.There is hope for Harry - also in hospital, and with his infected arm removed, he may yet have some kind of life. For Marion, though, I fear, there is only further decline.
