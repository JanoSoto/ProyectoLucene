Sometimes &#150; particularly in his silent films &#150; this could be a bit unnecessary and distracting, but in Rich and Strange it works for two reasons. First, it is always woven into that musical flow of images. Secondly he never allows it to interfere with the dramatic moments. In the second half of the picture, when the drama becomes more intense, his visual style settles down and the scenes are shot in a fairly straight ahead manner. This balanced structure, switching smoothly from heavy stylisation to stark simplicity as and when the story demands it, makes Rich and Strange all the more affecting and compelling.The plot has similarities to the forbidden-love dramas that Cecil B. DeMille made in the late teens and early 20s. Like DeMille, Hitchcock uses positioning of characters to show the affairs developing &#150; increasingly pairing the lovers together in one shot, amidst pretty framing devices. What is particularly neat is how, as Henry Kendall and Joan Barry's marriage starts to fall apart, Hitch several times frames them side by side appearing as mirror images of each other. These shots look quite funny, but also seem to summarise the state of mind of an increasingly bored couple. The dialogue is more or less superfluous &#150; which is just as well with the appalling sound quality.Contrary to what some have said, Rich and Strange is not one for Hitchcock completists only. Of course it will come as a disappointment for anyone expecting a thriller, but taken as the romantic drama that it is, this as tightly structured and expertly envisaged as the greatest of his suspense pictures. Rich and Strange is easily the best film from the first ten years of Hitch's career, and I would even go as far as to place it among the top four or five Hitchcocks of all time.

Once again, my relative inexperience with cinema seems to have caught me out; this film from Jean Renoir uses a similar formula, and predates it by almost fifteen years. Billy Wilder must certainly have seen 'The Grand Illusion (1937)' &#150; since it features Erich von Stroheim, whom he himself used in 'Five Graves to Cairo (1943)' and 'Sunset Blvd. (1950)' &#150; and so Renoir's influence is present throughout. It's a WWI film, but we see no combat. Whereas most anti-war films illustrate their stance by pounding the all-too-familiar adage war is hell through images of death and destruction, Renoir's approach is considerably more understated. He highlight the futility of war through human interaction, both between the captured French prisoners and between the Germans who watch over them.Just what is the grand illusion? Renoir derived his film title from The Great Illusion, a 1909 non-fiction book by Norman Angell, in which the author argued for the impossibility of a large-scale European war for economic reasons. That WWI broke out five years later obviously proved detrimental to Angell's arguments, and Renoir deliberately plays on the irony of this knowledge. More significant, however, is that the book was released in a revised edition in 1933, the general argument modified to assert the utter utility of waging war, a theme that supports Renoir's stance this would not be the war that ends all wars. With WWII just around the corner, there's an bitter urgency to what the film has to say; just three years later, the director would be fleeing France. The topicality of the film's message proved especially successful overseas, and 'The Grand Illusion' was unusually nominated for the Best Picture Oscar in 1939.Of course, no Jean Renoir film is complete without some class-related social critique. Most striking in this regard is the relationship between Capt. de Boeldieu (Pierre Fresnay) and Capt. von Rauffenstein (Erich von Stroheim), from which, scandalously, it is implied that one's class forms a more binding camaraderie than that of nationality. Boeldieu and Rauffenstein, both multilingual upper-class aristocrats who sense their social dominance is drawing to an end, seek solace in each other's company, and feel closer to one another than to the lower-class men of their own armies. However, there is hope in Renoir's vision of society. The age of aristocracy is coming to a close, and a new social order &#150; in which all men are accepted as comrades &#150; is at the cusp of existence. Boeldieu accepts this inevitability, and, despite the initial suspicion of his fellow Frenchmen, ultimately offers his life to allow two lower-class companions to escape. He betrays von Rauffenstein in favour of duty to his country, even if his death provides only temporary relief from the inescapable futility of war.

You don't get the deeper character development you manage to get out of The Final Chapter and a few of the subsequent films, but you will actually grow to like some of the doomed campers (particularly Shelly and Vera....the film's odd couple.....and you end up pretty dang surprised that Vera bites it, because in all honesty, her character is better developed and more all-around likable than the film's solo survivor, Chris Higgins). There is an interesting side note with a biker gang, a grocery store manager on a crapper, and a Crazy Ralph-esquire doomsday prophet. Pretty much all of the familiar clichés are here (the weird fat guy, the jock guy, the stoners, the hot chick...OK, several of those), and we even get a strange little back story that really adds nothing to our surviving camper's likability quotient....but DOES add a little bit of tension between Chris and Jason that we have not seen in the series yet (but an idea that Part 8 eventually tries to duplicate....even more poorly than this one does....at least in this one, it's an ORIGINAL idea...).The chase scene is a fairly big stand-out in the movie....it starts with a BANG as Chris finds the first body, and it doesn't let up from there....even if her annoying moaning and screaming gets on your nerves as bad as it did mine, the fight that she puts up with Jason will be appreciated by any horror fan.

DEFINITELY better than the other 3-D gimmick films of the early 80's (ever notice how Jaws 3-D, Amityville 3-D, and this one are all the THIRD pics in their series'?.....hmmm.....maybe Halloween 3 shoulda been in 3-D....but then again, nothing could save that slop....but i digress).

Why do so few films challenge their audiences? And why are the ones that do so hard to find? A film like Picnic at Hanging Rock is not just watched, it is experienced. Combining an attractive cast, breathtaking shots of nature, beautiful music, and some eerie sound effects, this film is a lot like the rock itself. It either absorbs you completely, or probably just rejects you like it does to various characters we meet.The story is presented in almost documentary manner at the beginning and very end, yet it is not based on any actual event. It is Valentine's Day in rural Australia in 1900. A dozen of more girls from an elite finishing school pile into a wagon and head out for a leisurely gathering at a foreboding rock formation.

Now, for those who haven't seen this, and have seen the likes of, oh, I don't know, The Hunchback of Notre Dame II or Tarzan and Jane, you may ask how this is possible.Start with the voice actors. You have the complete original cast back on board (minus Jonathan Freeman, for obvious reasons), plus a few extras. Jasmine may sound slightly different than she used to, but my spies tell me that she is indeed the same actress. John Rhys-Davies provides his voice for Aladdin's father, and the King of Thieves, Cassim. Jerry Orbach (of Beauty and the Beast fame) plays one of the forty thieves, Sa'luk. And finally, the star of the show has returned. I like Dan Castellaneta, and I think he did an acceptable job as the Genie, but Robin Williams is still the best.In fact, William's performance here could be best described as 'unleashed'. The Genie impersonates no less than five Disney characters, including Mickey Mouse himself, becomes an entire army (comprised of SWAT, cavalry, paratroopers, bagpipe men, the ED-209, and Pocahontas), picks up an elephant with his bare hands, and comforts Jasmine as Mrs. Doubtfire, albeit a bearded version.This movie has a coherent plot, which is, you know, strange for a Disney sequel. Some may say it was stolen from 'The Last Crusade' and I'd have to agree. You know, hero meets father, father is looking for some important artifact, appears to love it more than his family, but&#133; doesn't. Yeah. Except instead of the Holy Grail, we have this awesome Hand of Midas that can turn anything into gold.The villain foundation is not as good as the original, but Jerry Orbach still manages give us the next best thing with a grey-skinned, muscle-bound, wolverine-claw using man known as Sa'luk. I would rate his death scene as one of the best in cinematic history.Songs&#133; Ha. Well they don't measure up to the originals, but they do the best they can do. Genie is so over-the-top with his two songs that it's almost unbelievable, and the forty thieves song is quite entertaining. Just, uh, pretend that you can't hear the sappy song Aladdin and Jasmine sing about his childhood, as it may induce vomiting and\/or cancer.After the exercise of utter futility that was 'The Return of Jafar', this movie gives us some of the best direct-to-video animation you'll see out there.

Who needs detailed, close-up shots of man's internal organs spilling out like rice from a hole in a sack when you have the marvellous talent of Tobe Hooper? His craft makes TCM (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) one of the most brilliant and atmospheric films of any genre, never mind horror.The title pretty much sums up what to expect in the ensuing 80 minutes. An innocent, young group of people are caught up in bloodbath in the hot, dry and deserted back-lands of Texas. It is a simple premise, and it works well for what the film is. The characters themselves are much like the story, simple and straight-forward; there's no real depth to their personalities, but that is not entirely a bad-thing for director Hooper is more concerned with the film's depiction of horror, and the tension and atmosphere developed by this.As one may have been able to tell, it is the function and construction of horror which makes this film the classic that it is. The atmosphere and tension of the film makes your heart pound like it were begging for mercy to be released from your chest. The look of the film gives it a raw feeling, something unkempt, and dirty, like it were itself a rotting limb from one of Leatherface's several victims. Tobe Hooper's choice of setting, a farm house in the middle of a deserted Texas, adds a sense of isolation and helplessness; filming particular scenes in the dark also add to this effect as well as a sense of nowhere-to-run. The corroded, dry roar of Leatherface's chainsaw as an alternative to music builds the tension up fantastically; the louder the roar as it approaches any innocent individual, the more nails you bite. Chase scenes, in particular, feel never-ending; you simply want the hunted to escape somehow, and this adds loads more tension to what is already a very scary film. One aspect of Tobe Hooper's depiction of horror that is so wonderful is that he doesn't rely in any way on explicit gore, something which is common to most horror films, even the best of them.Tobe Hooper's achievement with Texas Chainsaw Massacre has been unrivalled to this day in terms of pure atmosphere and tension. Never has a film succeeded so well in keeping the audience on the edge of their seats feeling no other emotion other than anxiety for 80 straight minutes. And in my opinion, it is arguable to suggest that this is one of the best directed films in cinema history.

This movie isn't terrible, but it is fair to say, it is the worst out of the Aladdin trilogy. If you want a really good DTV sequel, check out Aladdin and the King of Thieves (the best DTV sequel) or Beauty and the BeastThe Enchanted Christmas.The characters were less appealing here.Most of the voice actors return, but all of them sound different. Aladdin and Jasmine were less mature here, as well as the Sultan. Jafar wasn't as frightening or as humorous as he was in the first movie, and Iago is sometimes annoying, unlike King of Thieves, when he is actually funny. Dan Castellanetta does a serviceable job as the genie(he is funny at times), but it just isn't the same without Robin Williams. The worst character was Abis Mal, I absolutely hate that character. He just grates on my nerves. The animation sometimes looks nice, but at other times, it has a rather nasty quality about it. Almost all the characters look poorly drawn, and I really didn't want to say this. Even the Genie wasn't up to top animation standard. It wasn't the backgrounds as such, some were very nice, it was the character animation that was the problem.As for the songs, they aren't dreadful, but they are the weakest batch in any Disney movie. Iago's singing made my ears bleed, and Second Rate sounded as though Jonathan Freeman was struggling with the song. (No wonder, it is very hard)I don't know about you but the old woman in the chair bit I found creepy as a kid. The best song in my opinion is there is nothing in the world quite like a Friend which has a decent melody. Also Liz Callaway has a nice singing voice. I really liked the incidental music though, and the scene of the winged horses.The story was the biggest problem, it went at such a slow pace. Also the villain back for revenge formula was over-familiar, and has been done so much better before. I also disliked the fact that Iago seemed to be the main character, when he was truly irritating here, and some of the dialogue is very lame, there was one part when Aladdin says something that is meant to be funny and he raises his eyebrows cheekily, but I found myself groaning than laughing. I'm sorry, that's my view. On a positive note, this film actually has one of the best climaxes in a DTV sequel, and the voice acting if different was decent especially Jonathan Freeman as Jafar.This is a very disappointing sequel, especially when it was released two years after the original. but on the bright side, it isn't as bad as the Cinderella and Jungle Book sequels, which are both thinly plotted. 6\/10.

The plot setting is not the Crystal Lake camp anymore but the surroundings, also in the countryside and in the woods of course (in spite of not being in the camp the setting is very similar). The characters, the suspense, the soundtrack, the deaths and even the clichés are pretty much the same.

Chad, this character, is probably the most purely evil character ever portrayed on film. Sure, there are psychos, sickos, nuts who chop people up, but they're really not all that real, and sometimes it's because they're not sane. Chad's real, and Chad's sane. When asked why he did it near the end of the film he says, coldly, 'because I could'. That's pure evil right there- a phenomenon we'd love to think is rare but which really isn't.The film is not a 'comedy' as the IMDb page suggests. I find the suggestion to be absurd and idiotic. Sure, there is dark humor here, and it is ultimately satirical, but it is at least as much a drama as a comedy and in my own perception far more significantly a drama. The film confronts head-on the male-driven workplace and its victimization of women, it confronts head-on the brand of misogyny that isn't uncommon among the white male businessman in North America today. That's not to say these characters, and the situation, aren't exaggerated. Sure they are, but that's a perfectly conscious, acceptable decision by the writer. The important thing is that the characters feel real, and that it is entirely possible for something like this to happen. Like The Shape of Things LaBute's screenplay is in-your-face and clear-cut about what it's trying to say.

Luckily helpful truck driver Warren 'Red' Barr (J.T.

Jeff starts to panic & with good reason as he soon finds out that Amy has been kidnapped by Warren & his gang & want a $90,000 ransom or he will kill her. Jeff is on his own & has to think quickly in order to save his wife as he doesn't have the 90,000 the thought of which is the only thing keeping Amy alive...Co-written & directed by Jonathan Mostow one has to say that Breakdown is a terrific, taught & often quite tense little action thriller that I personally rate highly, in my opinion it's certainly one of the better Hollywood made thrillers out there anyway. The script is nice & focused, there's not too much extraneous exposition & just about every scene moves the story forward in some way. The character's are simple yet you understand them, for instance we never find out too much about Jeff or Amy except they are moving house & find themselves in the situation they do & that's all we really need to know, the bad guy's don't have any deep motivation or anything & quite simply they do what they do for the money which is all that we need to know. The film has a good pace, the script throw's all sorts of difficult situations at Jeff & it's very entertaining & often fairly tense to see how he overcomes them. The script also has a really good balance, there's some gripping & intriguing thriller elements, there's some nice action adventure scenes, there's a touch of mystery & just enough exposition without slowing things down too much. Overall I liked Breakdown a lot & it's as simple & straight forward as that, if you think about it hard enough there are probably certain things that Jeff might have done differently & maybe considered slight plot-holes (the IMDb message boards for Breakdown are full of 'why didn't Jeff do this' or 'why didn't he do that' type threads) but that's just nitpicking really since Breakdown is a film so just enjoy it as such.There are some nice action sequences here as a jeeps ends up in a river, there's a couple of car chases including a pretty impressive one at the end & a tense scene in which Jeff has to climb along a truck while it is moving. The one part I didn't like was at the very end as the large truck was hanging off the bridge, my main problem with the scene was what was it hanging by exactly? There's a bit of violence & some profanity but nothing excessive.With a supposed budget of about $36,000,000 Breakdown is well made with good Hollywood polished production values, filmed in California star Kurt Russell was apparently helicoptered in & out of the shooting location so he could be with his family in Los Angeles at night. I must admit to being a bit of a Kurt Russell fan & have liked him in every film of his I have seen & I think he's great in this while the late J.T. Walsh makes for a cold calculating villain.Breakdown is a terrific action thriller & for me has the added bonus of starring one of my favourite Hollywood actors, I liked it a lot & definitely recommend it.

Let's just begin by saying that for almost everything good we find in the preceding Chapter and most of the subsequent and prior efforts, this all-out stinker manages to pretty much take a giant dump on the series.We find ourselves with a pretty strong (if somewhat confusing)opening....young Tommy Jarvis (in a cameo appearance I'm sure an adult Cory Feldman regrets) is going in the middle of the night (WHY??? And in thunderstorm, no less) to visit the grave of the Masked One, himself, Jason Voorhees. The same guy who killed his mother. The guy he dispatched in gruesome awesomeness in Part 4. Then, his visit is interrupted by a couple of truly stupid thrill seekers who want nothing more than to see a rotting corpse at night in a thunderstorm. As Tommy watches in horror at a (seemingly) safe distance, the vandals dig up Jason, they get killed by Jason (naturally), and Tommy is then killed, himself, by Jason.....the whole scene, in spite of its implausibility (it's OK...this IS a Friday flick) is actually pretty darn scary.And that's more or less where the thrills end.Tommy wakes up, no longer as a preteen Cory Feldman, but as a teenage mental patient.....he dreamed the whole thing. He's totally f#@*ed up from the events of Part 4, and he's headed to a halfway house for rehabilitation.....a halfway house in the middle of the woods at Crystal Lake.....RIGHT.......He arrives to the usual array of clichéd characters (for some strange reason, they are pretty much the same characters rehashed from the previous 4 films, only now being a pot-smoking, sex obsessed teen is a reason for mental institutionalisation). We meet Pam (the sexy assistant), Matt (the kind doctor in casual attire), Reggie (a slightly taller and no-less annoying version of Gary Coleman), Reggie's Gramps (Fred Sandford with positive moral values), and all the so-called nuts....including the hillbilly neighbors (who SHOULD be the ones in the halfway house, themselves).And what kind of Friday the 13th would it be if people didn't start getting hacked to pieces? Yep, it begins, only Jason doesn't start the mayhem.....a really pi$$ed off dude named Vic chops up the obligatory fat guy (COMMON SENSE ALERT....never give the guy with anger issues an AXE....).I'll just go ahead and ruin it right here, because from the moment the paramedics arrive to pick up the dead fat kid, it's OH-SO obvious who the killer is.....it's one of the paramedics (whose son just so happens to be the dead fat kid....well, pieces of the dead fat kid, anyhow).From this point on, an unseen killer begins slaughtering anyone and everyone in sight....is it Tommy? Is it the creepy guy shoveling crap from the Hillbillies' chicken coupe? Is it Colonel Mustard using the candle stick in the kitchen? Nope....although any one of those scenarios (particularly the first of them) would have been more interesting.....but one thing is for sure, it AIN'T Jason, people. Never mind the fact that we already pretty much figured from the get-go that the paramedic is the killer. Gee, what DO they teach in EMT courses, these days? It pretty much gets worse as the movie drags on....if you were expecting lots of gore, forget it....the MPAA hit this one (as well as the next three) HARD, and what we are left with is a lot of off-screen kills, a mannequin with a road flare in it's mouth, a painful-but-implausible death-by-leather strap, and a survivor (?) chick who likes to crawl around in the mud. We actually get the first beheading since the original Friday, and not even that one is very fun to watch. And, after waiting the ENTIRE movie, we finally see Jason (or Pseudo-Jason, anyhow) for about ten minutes after all the victims are dead. The pits.There are a FEW redeeming qualities....John Shepherd does a MARVELOUS job as the tortured Tommy. Harry Manfredini does his usual greatness with the music score. There are breasts....several of 'em....and probably the biggest pair in the series' history. We get to laugh out loud when Reggie takes off and leaves Pam in the dust during the chase scene. None of these perks helps to detract from the massive amount of shortcomings that plague the rest of the film.And unfortunately, we get the worst script (and that's saying a LOT) in the entire saga. Although none of the Friday the 13th films ever lost money at the box office, this was the first to be a disappointment to Paramount execs. Why? Well, let's see.....very little blood, NO JASON, more stupid characters than you could shake a stick at, NO JASON, an incredible boredom factor....and did I mention there's NO JASON????? This one actually spoke for your typical Friday the 13th fan.......we may not require a lot out of our plot, but at LEAST don't try to insult us by sticking Roy the Psychotic Paramedic in Mr. Voorhees's shoes and try to make us believe he IS Jason.And that's ANOTHER major gripe I have with Part 5.....the parental revenge scenario worked great for Betsy Palmer.....but it ROYALLY sucked when it was duplicated in this instance....give us a better reason for someone to just go off and snap like that.....maybe someone stole his ambulance and it pi$$ed him off.....maybe he's an unreformed former patient at the halfway house....maybe he just doesn't like the way his waitress cooked the eggs....hell, I don't know, but DON'T give us the same old my-son-is-dead-and-you-let-him-die bit.Friday the 13th (Part 5)-A New Beginning is without a doubt the worst of the series.

We meet Pam (the sexy assistant), Matt (the kind doctor in casual attire), Reggie (a slightly taller and no-less annoying version of Gary Coleman), Reggie's Gramps (Fred Sandford with positive moral values), and all the so-called nuts....including the hillbilly neighbors (who SHOULD be the ones in the halfway house, themselves).And what kind of Friday the 13th would it be if people didn't start getting hacked to pieces? Yep, it begins, only Jason doesn't start the mayhem.....a really pi$$ed off dude named Vic chops up the obligatory fat guy (COMMON SENSE ALERT....never give the guy with anger issues an AXE....).I'll just go ahead and ruin it right here, because from the moment the paramedics arrive to pick up the dead fat kid, it's OH-SO obvious who the killer is.....it's one of the paramedics (whose son just so happens to be the dead fat kid....well, pieces of the dead fat kid, anyhow).From this point on, an unseen killer begins slaughtering anyone and everyone in sight....is it Tommy? Is it the creepy guy shoveling crap from the Hillbillies' chicken coupe? Is it Colonel Mustard using the candle stick in the kitchen? Nope....although any one of those scenarios (particularly the first of them) would have been more interesting.....but one thing is for sure, it AIN'T Jason, people. Never mind the fact that we already pretty much figured from the get-go that the paramedic is the killer. Gee, what DO they teach in EMT courses, these days? It pretty much gets worse as the movie drags on....if you were expecting lots of gore, forget it....the MPAA hit this one (as well as the next three) HARD, and what we are left with is a lot of off-screen kills, a mannequin with a road flare in it's mouth, a painful-but-implausible death-by-leather strap, and a survivor (?) chick who likes to crawl around in the mud. We actually get the first beheading since the original Friday, and not even that one is very fun to watch. And, after waiting the ENTIRE movie, we finally see Jason (or Pseudo-Jason, anyhow) for about ten minutes after all the victims are dead. The pits.There are a FEW redeeming qualities....John Shepherd does a MARVELOUS job as the tortured Tommy. Harry Manfredini does his usual greatness with the music score. There are breasts....several of 'em....and probably the biggest pair in the series' history. We get to laugh out loud when Reggie takes off and leaves Pam in the dust during the chase scene. None of these perks helps to detract from the massive amount of shortcomings that plague the rest of the film.And unfortunately, we get the worst script (and that's saying a LOT) in the entire saga. Although none of the Friday the 13th films ever lost money at the box office, this was the first to be a disappointment to Paramount execs. Why? Well, let's see.....very little blood, NO JASON, more stupid characters than you could shake a stick at, NO JASON, an incredible boredom factor....and did I mention there's NO JASON????? This one actually spoke for your typical Friday the 13th fan.......we may not require a lot out of our plot, but at LEAST don't try to insult us by sticking Roy the Psychotic Paramedic in Mr. Voorhees's shoes and try to make us believe he IS Jason.And that's ANOTHER major gripe I have with Part 5.....the parental revenge scenario worked great for Betsy Palmer.....but it ROYALLY sucked when it was duplicated in this instance....give us a better reason for someone to just go off and snap like that.....maybe someone stole his ambulance and it pi$$ed him off.....maybe he's an unreformed former patient at the halfway house....maybe he just doesn't like the way his waitress cooked the eggs....hell, I don't know, but DON'T give us the same old my-son-is-dead-and-you-let-him-die bit.Friday the 13th (Part 5)-A New Beginning is without a doubt the worst of the series.

Let's just begin by saying that for almost everything good we find in the preceding Chapter and most of the subsequent and prior efforts, this all-out stinker manages to pretty much take a giant dump on the series.We find ourselves with a pretty strong (if somewhat confusing)opening....young Tommy Jarvis (in a cameo appearance I'm sure an adult Cory Feldman regrets) is going in the middle of the night (WHY??? And in thunderstorm, no less) to visit the grave of the Masked One, himself, Jason Voorhees. The same guy who killed his mother. The guy he dispatched in gruesome awesomeness in Part 4. Then, his visit is interrupted by a couple of truly stupid thrill seekers who want nothing more than to see a rotting corpse at night in a thunderstorm.

Not so in America, where forty years after his death the creation\/evolution issue was still the subject of furious debate in religious circles. In 1925 Tennessee passed a state law that prohibited the teaching of evolution in public schools, and a young teacher named John Scopes was put on trial for breaching that law. Inherit the Wind (based on an earlier play of the same name) is a fictionalised account of what became known as the Monkey Trial. The title comes from the Book of Proverbs He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind.All the leading figures in the trial are fictionalised. The characters Matthew Harrison Brady, Henry Drummond and Bertram Cates correspond to the historical figures of William Jennings Bryan (prosecutor), Clarence Darrow (Counsel for the defence) and Scopes. The town of Dayton, where the trial occurred, is here named Hillsboro. There are also some invented characters, such as the Reverend Jeremiah Brown, whose bigotry and fanaticism shock even Brady, and his daughter Rachel, who also happens to be Cates's girlfriend.The makers of Inherit the Wind, like the original playwrights Jerome Lawrence and Robert Lee, were probably less interested in the creation\/evolution debate itself than they were in using the Monkey Trial as a warning against intolerance and as a metaphor for McCarthyism. The film often departs from the historical facts of the trial, and generally does so in order to further this agenda. Cates is portrayed as the victim of unjust persecution, whereas in reality Scopes, who was a sports coach rather than a science teacher, was persuaded to volunteer for the role of defendant by the ACLU, which wanted to test the constitutionality of the state law, and by a group of Dayton businessmen who hoped that the publicity generated by the trial would boost the local economy. The people of Hillsboro are portrayed (with only a few exceptions) as hostile, hate-filled bigots, at one stage even threatening to lynch Cates and Drummond. In reality, even Darrow paid tribute to the courteous reception he was afforded by the citizens of Dayton.The film plays down the fact that Bryan, far from being part of what today would be called the Religious Right, was actually part of the Religious Left, holding progressive social views which he saw as being based on Christian teaching. His opposition to Darwin was not only theological; he also disliked the way in which evolutionary theory, under the guise of Social Darwinism, was being used to justify eugenics and laissez-faire capitalism. It also plays down the fact that H.L. Mencken, upon whom the journalist E.K. Hornbeck is based, was something of a reactionary who despised democracy and later became an apologist for Hitler.Another playwright of this period, Arthur Miller, also used historical events, in his case the Salem Witch Trials, to draw parallels with McCarthyism. I sometimes find myself in disagreement with Miller's political views, including his views on McCarthyism, but I am nevertheless a great admirer of his The Crucible, one of the most powerful theatrical dramas of the twentieth century. Similarly, I find that there is much to admire in Inherit the Wind, despite its occasionally tendentious political stance, largely because of the power and sincerity of the acting. Cates (played by Dick York, best known as Darrin Stephens in Bewitched) is a relatively minor figure; the main emphasis is on the courtroom clashes between Drummond and Brady. They are played by two great veterans, Spencer Tracy and Fredric March. March's Brady is sincerely devout but blinkered and narrow-minded; he is dangerous not because he is a wicked man but because he is so certain of the rightness of his ideas that he is unable to tolerate opposition to them. Tracy plays Drummond as a rather gruff liberal; the previous year Orson Welles had, in Compulsion, played a similar character also based upon Darrow. Like the historical Darrow, Drummond is an agnostic, but his main concern is not to attack religion but to oppose bigotry and to uphold freedom of speech. It is only when the judge refuses to let him question the constitutionality of the law or to call expert evidence on evolutionary biology that he resorts to cross-examining Brady on inconsistencies in the Bible.The third main character is Hornbeck, a non-singing, non-dancing role for Gene Kelly. He is nominally on the same side as Drummond, but the two eventually fall out. The liberal Drummond dislikes what he sees as Hornbeck's unprincipled cynicism and there is also a hint that the atheist Hornbeck is just as prejudiced and self-righteous as Brady. There is also a good performance from Claude Akins as Reverend Brown.The Cold War is now over and McCarthy is, for most people, just a name in the history books. The revival of the creationist controversy (which had died down somewhat by 1960) in recent years, however, means that the film has now taken on a greater literal significance than it had when first made. Millions of Americans (and quite a few people elsewhere) now believe that the Genesis account of creation is literally true and that it, and not the scientifically accepted theory of evolution, should be taught in schools. The views expressed by Spencer Tracy in this film still need to be heard in defence of science, reason and intellectual freedom against latter-day Matthew Bradys. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 February 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The 1960s are often seen as a decade of great social change, both in the film industry and elsewhere, and it is notable that the opening year of that decade saw two major films, Inherit the Wind and Elmer Gantry, which took a critical look at religion, a subject which filmmakers had previously been obliged to treat in a respectful manner.In Charles Darwin's native Britain the religious controversy which his evolutionary theories provoked when first published largely died away during his lifetime; when he died in 1882 the Church granted him the honour of burial in Westminster Abbey.

It is only when the judge refuses to let him question the constitutionality of the law or to call expert evidence on evolutionary biology that he resorts to cross-examining Brady on inconsistencies in the Bible.The third main character is Hornbeck, a non-singing, non-dancing role for Gene Kelly. He is nominally on the same side as Drummond, but the two eventually fall out. The liberal Drummond dislikes what he sees as Hornbeck's unprincipled cynicism and there is also a hint that the atheist Hornbeck is just as prejudiced and self-righteous as Brady. There is also a good performance from Claude Akins as Reverend Brown.The Cold War is now over and McCarthy is, for most people, just a name in the history books. The revival of the creationist controversy (which had died down somewhat by 1960) in recent years, however, means that the film has now taken on a greater literal significance than it had when first made. Millions of Americans (and quite a few people elsewhere) now believe that the Genesis account of creation is literally true and that it, and not the scientifically accepted theory of evolution, should be taught in schools. The views expressed by Spencer Tracy in this film still need to be heard in defence of science, reason and intellectual freedom against latter-day Matthew Bradys. 8\/10 ","genre":"Drama, History"},{"date":"11 February 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Some films know not to take themselves too seriously. Gladiator is one of the few films that know it must take itself seriously. It sweeping story, epic action, unflinching villain, determined ensemble, involving story, and larger than life hero make this a classic film by more than one standard. Director Ridley Scott (Blade Runner, Alien, American Gangster, Black Hawk Down, Thelma & Louise) has made many a great film but his ability to let his incredible visual technique tell his stories is by far an aspect that has made him a legend. The narrative itself is not lacking in anyway. In fact it might be the best one Scott has presided over. Maximus's rise from noble general, to broken man, to finally a valiant, defiant, righteous hero is beautiful, triumphant and heart-braking. Russell Crowe can embody any hero and here he take on a true superhero like persona. Senators, queen, and Roman citizens rally around him to bring down a suspicious emperor. To us though Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) is much more than suspicious we see him as disturbed, perhaps perverted, certainly sadistic, evil, murdering, disillusioned son of Marcus Aurelius (whom he murdered when he found that Maximus was to be emperor). The battle scene at the beginning when Maximus's troops rout the Germanic tribes is hauntingly beautiful and glorious. Also worth noting is the solid display of the supporting performances. Connie Nielsen is stellar as Lucilla, a woman who is caught between trying to best her diabolical brother (whom she still loves because he is family) and trying to keep her son safe. The implied past relationship between her and Maximus adds to the stakes of the story. Derek Jacobi is well cast as a seasoned determined senator on the side of Maximus. Djimon Hounson and the later Oliver Reed are likable and identifiable as Maximus's gladiator allies. On the whole Gladiator is unforgettable, involving story whose characters move us. The action is thrilling, the stakes are many, and our hero personifies righteousness and strength. This film won the Academy Award for 2000's Best Picture. I highly doubt it that close of a vote.

Certain aspects of the film seemed dated. But there are many aspects that are quite relevant too.It has an interesting premise. A struggling screenwriter Joe Gillis(William Holden) starts living with an old star of the silent era Norma Desmond(Gloria Swanson) in order to write a screenplay for a movie she wants to act in(which is supposed to be her big comeback). Joe is amused by Norma's behaviour. She still lives in an illusory world in her mansion where she is still a big star. Her faithful servant Max Von Mayerling also feeds her ego and keeps telling her that she is a big star. Norma begins falling in love with Joe and gives him presents in order to keep him. The movie then follows Norma's degeneration and the final over the top conclusion. The situation of old actresses who were stars in the past is very well portrayed in this movie. The dry humour and sarcasm in this movie is also an aspect that raises it above the other classics of the Old Hollywood era. It can also be seen as a satire of the Hollywood system. The scene where the director tells his assistants not to call her again - the same director who had once promoted her heavily - is a sad scene which shows the fleeting nature of showbiz. The portrayal of Norma's obsession with Joe is also excellent. The way Joe gillis uses the opportunity to his own advantage is also quite funny in a sad depressing way.The attitudes of the people reveal a somewhat dated attitude that doesn't quite fit in today. The scene in the shop where the shopkeeper says Well, as long as the lady's paying for it, why not take the vicuña? shows a somewhat derisive attitude towards a woman having a trophy man(while the opposite has been accepted). The attitude of Joe Gillis also seems dated. He behaves as if he is embarrassed that an older woman is interested in him. The line I had to be with people my own age. shows the derisive attitude he has towards Norma's love towards him. I felt that the movie was a bit behind the times in these aspects. The ending was also a bit too over the top for my liking.The performances are top notch. The laidback acting style of William Holden is complemented by the over the top performance of Gloria Swanson. The over the top performance was appropriate in this movie, I guess. In many scenes she even seemed cute when she proclaims that she is one of the biggest stars. There is a likability to her character even though she seems a bit unhinged throughout. Nancy Olson is gorgeous and she is adequate for the role. Erich Von stroheim is very good as the faithful servant Max and it is surprising to note that he wasn't a professional actor while doing this film. Cecil de mille's cameo is actually quite good.I liked the movie but felt that the movie seemed a bit too dated for my taste.

No matter how many times I see it, it just gets better and better, like burgundy. Jane Greer's performance is one of the most subtle and sophisticated portrayals of a corrupt female ever filmed. The way she alternates between domination and whimpering submission in the twinkling of an eye, over and over again, like a dog that fawns before it can be beaten, then snarls and snaps, then fawns again, her innate compulsion to lie and conceal, her ruthlessness, her weakness, her lack of hesitation to kill, her need to steal, her passion, her lust, her self-contempt intimately interlaced with an obscene self-love, is all simply spectacular. In this brilliant story and script by Daniel Mainwaring, she seems to replicate her weird relationship with Howard Hughes by being the moll of smooth gangster Kirk Douglas, who at 31 was in only his second film role and pulls it off wonderfully by seeming much older. The hero is Robert Mitchum, he of the gliding hipster walk and shoulders as broad as a bus, who looks down at Greer with alternating infatuation and horror, a helpless victim of her irresistible allure, but also adept at saving himself from danger time after time, and not hesitant at telling her to get lost. (However, no man can really tell Jane Greer to get lost, because who can resist her?) The direction by Jacques Tourneur surpasses even his usual excellence. Dickie Moore adds a superb and haunting touch of strangeness as a deaf-mute devoted to Mitchum. Rhonda Fleming, in only her fifth credited screen role, puts plenty of her own glamour about, and isn't leaving the field wholly to Greer. The script has lots of terrific one-liners, which are highly amusing, if occasionally corny. There are plenty of such opportunities to laugh out loud. Sometimes the drollery is exaggerated on purpose, such as when Rhonda Fleming says to Mitchum at her first meeting 'Do you always leave your fingerprints all over a girl's shoulder? Not that I'm complaining, mind you. You have big strong hands.' But Mitchum has seen gals like Rhonda before, and isn't falling for any of that stuff. This film isn't really about the story, it's about the people and the atmosphere. Who cares who shoots whom, who falls off a cliff into a river, who steals whose documents, who gets the dough or doesn't get the dough. That's all beside the point.
