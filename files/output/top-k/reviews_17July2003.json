From what I read, 'Nark Dark' is supposed to be one of the most innovative and interesting vampire horror films of all time. It didn't take me long to realize how truly awful it is; however, I sat through the whole thing nonetheless. Here's what initially confused me how could anyone call this innovative when it has cliché written all over it? Everything from the unlikely love between a vampire and a human to the police search subplot and everything in between is trash.Sure - it's well done trash - but that still qualifies it as trash. Some of the special effects are impressive, particularly the combustion that occurs when the vampires touch light. The subtle, haunting soundtrack by Tangerine Dream deserves all of the recognition that it has received over the years. And Bigelow's framing is surprisingly beautiful at times - a shot of the vampires on top of a moonlighted hill and Adrian's second wrist-sucking scene amongst oilrigs are both not to be forgotten, but these occasional bright spots do not save 'Near Dark' from being anything more than a mindless slasher flick.Fans seem to love the fact that these vampires have been modernized - they certainly don't wear long cloaks or suddenly turn into bats and fly away. What I'd like to know is - so what? The film doesn't actually go anywhere but down with this premise, and if vampires must be depicted as insanely irrational murderers then couldn't it have been done in a slightly less juvenile, idiotic way? There are no good characterizations in this film - everyone fits a stereotype, right down to the unfortunate patrons of the bar that the vampires terrorize. The vampires act so over-the-top that, combined with Bigelow's in-your-face direction, makes the film more forcibly laughable than creepy or frightening in any way.The traditional vampire story is very interesting, but this film is in no way an intelligent riff on the genre. The better part of this film is basically about showing how incredibly stupid these vampires are by coming up with newly creative ways of offing people - and no doubt they are creative, which probably accounts for the cult following that this film has of people who get their kicks out of watching mindlessly exaggerated killings. The acting is awful all around, although there wasn't really much of a script to work with anyway. The dialogue is horrid - perhaps if both the vampires and the humans talked like everyday people then the film would've achieved the gritty, realistic tone that it was clearly going for.The film even contradicts its overall aim in showing us that humanity perseveres by having the protagonist happily endear himself to the amoral vampires (witness the scenes following the police shootout escape.) The plot relies on coincidences to progress the storyline - wow, Caleb's father and sister just so happen to be staying at the same motel! And there are some hilarious inconsistencies - it turns from night to day unbelievably quickly at that same motel. And I had to repress my laughter when we see Caleb ride his horse through an open street - this juxtaposition just doesn't work well at all.The way that the film moves along even has a made-for-TV thriller quality about it, with standard cutting between the distraught father and the vampires' murderous actions.  'Near Dark' could have at least tried to be slightly complex or remotely thoughtful instead of simply focusing on how entertaining it can be to see people getting their throats slashed open. It's really is a shame too, because Bigelow's obvious visual flair - when coupled with a plausible screenplay - can potentially produce a great film.

Of course this was usually during the school week, which somehow made it even more desirable. The trip was nearly always made to see Monty Python films.For years I have lamented that few seem to remember Jabberwocky from the Python canon. It was not until I scanned the IMDb site this week that I discovered that it officially was NOT one of the Monty Python movies. This is a pity, since it perfectly maintains the flavor and feel of their other movies-although it may lack some of the frantic pace and rapid-fire gags.I have just viewed Jabberwocky for the first time in several years and still find it to be an extremely enjoyable film. I still consider it a Monty Python film, whatever they say, and still consider it second in their canon, only to The Holy Grail. Like other Python films, Jabberwocky catches the essence of its time period. In these films, excrement, hunger, death and eminent danger are always close at hand-and well as some clever anachronisms. I'm not sure whether or not parodying the unrealistic romance of medieval times, as portrayed in movies, was one of the group's main goals. This certainly seems to have been a key point, though.In Jabberwocky, Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin continue their fine work from the Holy Grail-minus the rest of the gang, of course, just two years later. They tackle one of my favorite poems, Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky. The film actually combines slapstick comedy, historic adventure and horror. We don't see the hideous Jabberwock until the very end.and then it is quite in keeping with Sir John Tennial's rendition of it. Borrowing John Williams' Jaws score as the monster approaches, just two years after the movie, adds a nice comic touch.To briefly summarize, Palin is Dennis Cooper, named so for being an apprentice to his father, a master cooper or barrel-maker (Paul Curran). Rather than his father, though, Dennis looks up to a neighbor and merchant, Mr. Fishfinger (Warren Mitchell). This finally leads to Dennis' father disowning him on his deathbed. Dennis bids good-bye to his true love, Fishfinger's fat, rude and uninterested daughter, Griselda (Annette Balland), before heading off to the big city to make his own way.Meanwhile, the Jabberwock has been terrorizing the entire kingdom, destroying whole villages and forcing panic-stricken peasants to flee to the giant walled city. The wonderfully named King Bruno the Questionable (Max Wall) is being pressured by his chief chamberlain (Jon Le Mesurier) to rid the country of the monster, while leading merchants urge him NOT to do so. (Business has never been better than during the panicked migration to the city!)Without giving out spoilers, let us say that Dennis finds more trouble than he had imagined in and out of the big city, including a jousting tournament to determine a champion to fight the Jabberwock (and a DELIGHTFUL means of finally choosing the champion after 2\/3 of the nation's nights are killed or maimed in the competition) and several narrow escapes.The movie has wonderful absurdities, such as Dennis' unrequited love for the obnoxious and unattractive Griselda, compared to the amorous advances of the lovely princess (Deborah Fallender), the king's first long-winded herald (John Bird), and a cult of masochistic religious fanatics. Anachronisms like `rush hour' in the city, `rats on a stick' and Dennis' constant efficiency-expert suggestions ring out delightfully among the muck and mire of ye olden times.This film deserves neither to be forgotten nor to be trashed. It still provides laughs, chills and a somewhat thoughtful look (as in the true Python films) at history. Even the climactic scenes with the Jabberwock look pretty darn good for a fairly low-budget 1975 film! Check it out and enjoy.just beware the jubjub bird and shun the frumious bandersnatch!

Rather than his father, though, Dennis looks up to a neighbor and merchant, Mr. Fishfinger (Warren Mitchell). This finally leads to Dennis' father disowning him on his deathbed. Dennis bids good-bye to his true love, Fishfinger's fat, rude and uninterested daughter, Griselda (Annette Balland), before heading off to the big city to make his own way.Meanwhile, the Jabberwock has been terrorizing the entire kingdom, destroying whole villages and forcing panic-stricken peasants to flee to the giant walled city. The wonderfully named King Bruno the Questionable (Max Wall) is being pressured by his chief chamberlain (Jon Le Mesurier) to rid the country of the monster, while leading merchants urge him NOT to do so. (Business has never been better than during the panicked migration to the city!)Without giving out spoilers, let us say that Dennis finds more trouble than he had imagined in and out of the big city, including a jousting tournament to determine a champion to fight the Jabberwock (and a DELIGHTFUL means of finally choosing the champion after 2\/3 of the nation's nights are killed or maimed in the competition) and several narrow escapes.The movie has wonderful absurdities, such as Dennis' unrequited love for the obnoxious and unattractive Griselda, compared to the amorous advances of the lovely princess (Deborah Fallender), the king's first long-winded herald (John Bird), and a cult of masochistic religious fanatics. Anachronisms like `rush hour' in the city, `rats on a stick' and Dennis' constant efficiency-expert suggestions ring out delightfully among the muck and mire of ye olden times.This film deserves neither to be forgotten nor to be trashed. It still provides laughs, chills and a somewhat thoughtful look (as in the true Python films) at history. Even the climactic scenes with the Jabberwock look pretty darn good for a fairly low-budget 1975 film! Check it out and enjoy.just beware the jubjub bird and shun the frumious bandersnatch!

Of course this was usually during the school week, which somehow made it even more desirable. The trip was nearly always made to see Monty Python films.For years I have lamented that few seem to remember Jabberwocky from the Python canon. It was not until I scanned the IMDb site this week that I discovered that it officially was NOT one of the Monty Python movies. This is a pity, since it perfectly maintains the flavor and feel of their other movies-although it may lack some of the frantic pace and rapid-fire gags.I have just viewed Jabberwocky for the first time in several years and still find it to be an extremely enjoyable film. I still consider it a Monty Python film, whatever they say, and still consider it second in their canon, only to The Holy Grail. Like other Python films, Jabberwocky catches the essence of its time period. In these films, excrement, hunger, death and eminent danger are always close at hand-and well as some clever anachronisms. I'm not sure whether or not parodying the unrealistic romance of medieval times, as portrayed in movies, was one of the group's main goals. This certainly seems to have been a key point, though.In Jabberwocky, Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin continue their fine work from the Holy Grail-minus the rest of the gang, of course, just two years later. They tackle one of my favorite poems, Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky. The film actually combines slapstick comedy, historic adventure and horror. We don't see the hideous Jabberwock until the very end.and then it is quite in keeping with Sir John Tennial's rendition of it.

If you got hooked on the original episodes, then your attitude towards the first six films is vastly different than a casual viewer. Because in those first films you got to see a world made barely believable by bad make-up and worse special effects come to life in a very real, breathtaking way(or about as real as 1980's special effects could get). If not, I could see how they might seem dated and lame.As an ending to that series, Star Trek VI succeeds for many reasons - the first one being that it engages us in the characters.  On a fundamental level that is where V failed.  ST5 turned the entire crew into an aging set of charicatures.  In VI we see a little depth put into the mix.  Endings are bittersweet, and while a tinge of sadness hangs over the whole film, another overarching theme seems to be the wisdom (or gravity) of age, of knowing when it is time to step gracefully into the shadows.  For, any true hero knows when to make an exit as well as an entrance.As an homage to films past, it seems that Meyer was channeling almost exclusively from The Manchurian Cantidate.  Although there were some other references to films that I didn't realize until I read other users comments. The suspense and conspiracy elements of the plot do well to distract the viewer from dwelling on the fact that this is it.There are some weak links to this films, most notably DeForest Kelley and George Takei's performances (they were never the strongest actors, but here Kelley is simply bad, while Takei over-emotes to the point of nausea). As well, the tendency to lean back on sitcom-esque one-liners, while on the surface is diverting, tends to strip credibility from the overall images that Meyer and Nimoy are trying to portray.  The guess who's coming to dinner? line in particular seems to have been created specifically for use in a theatrical trailer.  Also, there are major plot holes surrounding the character of Valeris that would have been easily resolved if Saavik had been in the story as originally intended.Well paced, and interesting, with some of the best SFX of the original series films, ST6 is a must see for even a casual fan of TOS.
