I can see now why this film was nominated for so many Razzie awards because it most certainly deserved it.Let me begin shall I - the actors To be honest I was so disgusted to see Lorraine Gary reprise her role as Ellen Brody. Her being in a movie like this made me never want to see another movie with her again. And then we get introduced by even more lame actors. Mario Van Peebles comes into this movie as an annoying fast-talking Jamacian freak. This is where the film takes place in The Bahamas. They make the shark swim in warm water. Wow! What an accomplishment! NOT! Lastly, Michael Caine also stars in this movie. Now, let me ask a personal question, how is it that a great actor such as Michael Caine be put in cast of a really terrible movie like this? This film just had a lot of unnecessary actors who each gave a very poor performance in this film. Plus, it says here that Lorraine Gary had won a Saturn Award or something for Best Supporting Actress. I don't know how the hell she managed to win an award for something like that being in a movie like this.- the dialogue The worst scripted movie I've ever listened to in my life. This Jaws movie is the only one in the series that's rated PG-13. My guess is that it's because the writer felt that he needed everyone using the word, s***, scene after scene, so that it would help make the movie more interesting and good. It absolutely didn't! The action was so slow-paced and there was hardly any suspense built up in this movie whatsoever. The dialogue was just awful, in every sense of the word.- the special effects The special effects in this Jaws movie weren't at all better or even improved since the last Jaws films. So, you mean to tell me that they made the shark stand on its tail and roar like a lion? In case the filmmakers didn't know, sharks do not even roar and they most certainly cannot stand up on their tails on water. The special effects really were dull and it was so obvious to tell that the shark was fake.- the acting The acting in this movie is probably one of the worst I've ever heard. Really, it's absolutely atrocious. I was so sick of having to hear that little girl, whatever her name was, Thea, singing and screaming almost half the time throughout the whole movie. I can understand that they're all on vacation and she wants to have a fun time, but you know what, when it comes to Jaws, right when people see the shark swimming around, they should have to scream as if they're really scared. This girl, every time when I heard her scream, it sounded like she was screaming in a very hysterical manner, and that was just sad to see.In conclusion, This is one of the worst movies that I've ever seen in my entire life. Heck, on the back of the DVD case it says that it's a suspense-packed thriller and that it's the scariest 'Jaws' of them all. Yeah? Well, that's complete bulls***! It is in no way, shape or form a suspense-packed thriller and it certainly isn't the scariest 'Jaws' movie of all time. It's just like any other regular B-monster movie with poor actors, poor script and poor special effects. Only this one doesn't even show the shark most of the time, there's barely any action in this movie whatsoever, and not a lot of people get killed or eaten in it too. I've finished counting up exactly how many people actually get eaten by Jaws in this movie. The result is 2. How disappointing is that? That in the other Jaws films, more people got eaten by Jaws and in this one, the filmmakers made only 2 people get eaten by Jaws in a 1 hour and 31 minute film? I don't even need to explain how terrifyingly bad this movie was any further. I think I've pretty much covered all of it up. If you're a fan of the first Jaws movie, I would recommend avoiding watching this poor excuse of a sequel. Trust me, it's totally not worth it.With all of that said, I give Jaws The Revenge, 1 star out of 10.

OK, we all know sequels are pretty much remakes, reboots or at least unoriginal attempts to cash-in on the success of the original and that's pretty much what we get here. This certainly isn't a bad movie but over the years I find myself liking it less and less each time I see it as the flaws are certainly pretty clear. For starters, the film has an overall made-for-TV look to it. I'm not sure what it is but this just doesn't really look like a big-budget Hollywood movie and some of this might be due to the director just not doing that good of a job building up anything in the film. I mean, there's very little in terms of suspense and he also has a story built around a bunch of kids, many who can't act to save their life. The film is often criticized for not building up suspense and for showing the shark too much but I've got mixed thoughts on this. I'm sure everyone involved knew they weren't going to top the Spielberg film so they instead went with a slasher mentality of just having the shark stalk out its victims. I didn't mind the fact that they kept showing the shark because they really didn't have anything else to do since there was no tension and the story was really lacking. However, by seeing the shark too much it becomes clear how fake looking it actually is. We got a pretty decent attack on a boat, which causes the shark's face to catch fire, something that has come under attack by fans, but I didn't mind this too much. As for the attack scenes they're all pretty tame but it's clear the filmmakers were trying to get a PG rating so there's not too much violence or blood. The most memorable one would have to be a scene where one lady gets eaten whole. Everyone knows Scheider didn't want to do this film, for good reasons, but that didn't stop him from delivering a fine performance. He really gets back into the character without problem and I thought he handled everything very well. Lorraine Gary returns as his wife and Murray Hamilton is back as the Mayor. I think it was a big mistake making the Mayor someone who didn't believe Brody again as this was used in the previous film and you'd think he would have learned his lesson. With all the negative things it's still hard not to get some sort of entertainment out of this thing. It doesn't come close to anything in the original movie but at least we did get three characters back and at least they did try to continue the story (even if it wasn't believable).

His niece, whom is named after him suspects that he is not all he claims to be, when two detectives start questioning them.Rope, Saboteur and now Shadow of A Doubt. These are the only three films from the legendary Hitchcock that I have seen. Each one couldn't be more different. One is confined to one room, while another takes one character across America. Shadow of a Doubt tells the tale of family secrets and takes us to a small town. The film creates the tension needed to make one just uneasy enough to sit through the film. Shadow of a Doubt is considered one of Hitchcock's classic films and according to his daughter, his personal favourite. I found it to be rather brilliant at times, but testing at others. Joseph Cotten plays the character of uncle Charlie, who is downright frightening at times and made my enjoyment of the film more fulfilling. I won't go into detail about the plot of the film, I went in knowing nothing about it and appreciate it more because of that. The film doesn't depend on star power or any glamour, just the story and characters. The uncle Charlie character is one creepy guy who is portrayed brilliantly by Joseph Cotten. In one brilliant scene he has a monologue that is pretty harsh, even by today's standards and one simple turn of the head makes the scene all the more intense and creepy.The film doesn't reach the suspense levels of other films in his catalogue, I've seen bits and pieces of Rear Window, which was more suspenseful, but it does have the slow burner feel that builds up to something. You know some kind of confrontation is about to happen at the climax and your itching for it to happen the whole time. A few things did bother me though, even if they were intentional.The sexual tension between uncle and niece is just a bit much. It seemed that in every scene they were itching to go at each other. The constant talking about how much they have in common and how they are so alike is fine, until they start to hold each other and get close. It's uncomfortable. Second, the detective declaring his love for Charlie, totally out of place. To me there was not enough room for the two to grow as a romantic couple. Does she feel the same way? No, which is what made me a little bit happier, had she had the same feelings as him, I would have been upset with this film.Shadow of a Doubt is a well crafted thriller that doesn't mind taking it's time getting to where it wants to go. Subtle hints here and there adds to the mystery of what's going and is intriguing. It pulls the viewer into the web that is this story. It's not my favourite Hitchcock film, but rather one that I appreciate and respect the most, at least so far.

It was apparently a box office success during its run that year, and I had been familiar with that 1960's sci-fi series for many years by the time this spoof was released, but I never even heard of Galaxy Quest until years after its release. I first saw it in 2007 and was not disappointed. That was very soon after I had first seen ¡Three Amigos! for the first time, and I found that this film was like a sci-fi version of that western spoof. I watched this movie for the second time in 2008, and I guess I still thought it was pretty good, but not as good as the first time. However, it's been over two years since then, and I recently decided to watch it again. This time, I can rate it 8\/10 instead of 7, just like I did after my first viewing.It has been seventeen years since the cancellation of Galaxy Quest, a cult sci-fi TV series, but the former members of the show's cast appear at conventions and grand openings. Jason Nesmith, the egotistical former actor known for his role in the show as Commander Peter Quincy Taggart, meets some mysterious individuals one day! At first, he thinks they're a group of obsessive Galaxy Quest fans, and goes along with them, but these are actually real extraterrestrial beings that have seen episodes of the show, and Jason finds himself on a real spaceship for the first time! Soon, the entire former cast of the sci-fi show find themselves on board. Unfortunately, where these aliens are from, the concept of acting is unheard of, and they think these fictional episodes are historical documents! For that reason, they are now counting on these former TV stars to save their kind from the evil General Sarris! These Galaxy Quest cast members staged many adventures like this in the show, but can they do it for real?! In this film, the story begins at a convention, with the Galaxy Quest cast about to appear in front of an audience. This part is memorably funny, introducing the lead characters and showing how Jason Nesmith's ego causes trouble for the others (based on William Shatner and the trouble other Star Trek cast members had with him), and Alexander Dane (another main character) not wanting to appear at this convention. The starring roles in this 1999 movie are played by Tim Allen (Nesmith), Sigourney Weaver (Gwen DeMarco), and Alan Rickman (Dane), and these three all deserve credit for a job well done. The supporting cast is generally impressive as well. The movie isn't consistently hilarious, but there are a number of comic highlights, such as Jason meeting the aliens and thinking it's all a show at first, what happens when the other former GQ stars board the ship for the first time, Alexander served what the aliens think he eats, etc. The conflict between Nesmith and the other former sci-fi stars, the aliens (even if they can be pretty silly), the Alexander Dane character's bitter remarks, and other things help with the humour. There were times when I laughed, and other times when I smiled. As well as being funny, this spoof can also be exciting, sometimes even poignant. Unsurprisingly, there are also great sets and special effects.This movie parodies various aspects of Star Trek, including William Shatner's arrogance causing trouble for other cast members and the show's hardcore following. Unlike some modern spoof movies, this one actually works for the most part. There may be some fairly weak scenes, but fortunately not very many, and my third viewing might have been my most memorable one. ¡Three Amigos! parodies the western genre and Galaxy Quest parodies sci-fi, but the main characters in both movies are actors who find themselves actually doing what they've only been known to act out on screen, and both of them can certainly be funny. I've seen Tim Allen in more than one unfunny comedy and know of some others which I haven't seen but know they're not so popular. This doesn't mean ALL his films are bad, but clearly, he hasn't had the greatest film career in Hollywood history.

Nice to see them together again after Rio Bravo.- I usually don't pay much attention to musical scores, but this one stood out as very good.- Good story. The characters were all believable (with certain exceptions listed below) and I cared about everybody at the end.- Nice supporting cast. Martin is excellent. I always like Earl Holliman. Paul Fix is solid. Very nice work by George Kennedy as the henchman. James Gregory is appropriately slimy and devious as the heavy. Interesting appearance by Dennis Hopper as his sniveling son. Even a short bit by my fave Strother Martin.- This was a typical town Western. Town Westerns are usually very restricted in their use of dramatic Western scenery and landscapes. Shane solved this problem by placing the town right at the foot of the Grand Tetons. I liked the way this movie used a couple of subplots to get out into the country for some scenes. i.e. the Elders' horse drive and their later prisoner transfer to Laredo.- The plot was pretty clever regarding the timing and place of Paul Fix's murder and the Elder's trip to Pecos to pick up the horses.Here's what dragged the movie down- Wayne's just way too old for his role. He was 57 when he made this, but was coming off of a major lung operation, making him look much older. It appears Katie Elder gave birth to her youngest son at age 50 or older!! - It's especially ridiculous for him to have a romantic interest. I believe this may have been his last quasi romantic lead role before moving on to more appropriate parts as a father and grandfather.- The basic plot is confusing. Bass Elder was murdered six months before Katie died, yet the sons only returned for Katie's funeral? The script waxes romantic about Katie almost endlessly. Perhaps the boys didn't care for their father? Then why do they risk their lives to avenge his death?- The actress who played the female romantic interest was horrible and her part was gratuitous and creepy, given her flirtation with a man almost old enough to be her grandfather.

He was 57 when he made this, but was coming off of a major lung operation, making him look much older. It appears Katie Elder gave birth to her youngest son at age 50 or older!! - It's especially ridiculous for him to have a romantic interest. I believe this may have been his last quasi romantic lead role before moving on to more appropriate parts as a father and grandfather.- The basic plot is confusing. Bass Elder was murdered six months before Katie died, yet the sons only returned for Katie's funeral? The script waxes romantic about Katie almost endlessly. Perhaps the boys didn't care for their father? Then why do they risk their lives to avenge his death?- The actress who played the female romantic interest was horrible and her part was gratuitous and creepy, given her flirtation with a man almost old enough to be her grandfather.

Park creator (Louis Gossett, Jr.) is about to open a new attraction when a Great White shark gets into the park and begins its destruction. It's pretty clear that the only reason this movie was made was to cash in on the title as well as the 3-D effects, which were becoming popular again. I've heard from countless people that this film was one of the worst looking 3-D movies and that's pretty easy to see even when viewing it in 2-D. I was surprised to see how poorly this film was shot and at times how dark the footage actually is. Just take a look at the sequence where they're trying to lure the shark into the tunnel. This entire sequence is so dark that you'd think someone dropped some ink on the film print. The actual story of a shark entering Sea World just doesn't work for a number of reasons. For starters, there's really no epic feel of an ocean going on here. Having everything taking place in the park just gives the film a very small feel to it. It also doesn't help that the shark really doesn't get to attack very many people here. The film really doesn't have any guts as no one we care about every gets attacked and for the most part we get poorly constructed characters who are going to be the obvious bait. The shark here is also rather mixed. We get some footage of a real shark thrown in yet this ends up being a major goof because when the shark is actually captured and brought into a tank, it's obviously a lot smaller than the one we see used in the real footage. The shark itself looks okay but I can't say it was better than the previous two. It's certainly the biggest of the three but this is pretty much wasted as she (yes, it's a girl) doesn't get to do too much. I'm really not sure why'd they'd spend the money to build this thing and then not do much with it. What's most shocking about this film is the fact that the performances are probably the best thing. Both Quaid and Armstrong are good but they're obviously drowning in a bad screenplay. Lea Thompson is cute in her few moments here but Gossett is pretty much wasted. He turns in a fine performance but there's just not much he can do with the character. As far as the attacks go, we get one great one where we see the killing from inside the shark's mouth. This scene is worth sitting through everything else. The ending with the shark breaking through the glass is just silly and pretty much sums up everything you need to know about this movie. I'm not sure if the original idea of having a spoof would have worked any better but this here is certainly the least in the series and one that can easily be forgotten. It should be noted however that Universal pulled the plug on the 1981 Italian rip-off GREAT WHITE, which borrowed dialogue, scenes and stories from the first two films in the series.

Right? Wrong. I liked Wild Wild West, yes that's right I liked it & it has problems but is a fun ride that I found more entertaining I had any right to expect considering Wild Wild West has a really bad reputation. Straight away I liked the playful & often funny script, sure it's absurd with a huge mechanical Spider, a legless villain, flying machines, decapitation traps & a plot to take control of the US but I was entertained & thought it moved along like a rocket with barely a wasted moment as the jokes, visual gags & special effects come thick & fast. The humour is hit & miss I will say that, I thought some of it was very funny like the hilarious speech Will Smith gives to the Louisiana plantation mob while at other times I thought it was embarrassing like Will Smith turning up in a see through Harem outfit to save Kevin Line but what the hell at least it tries & there's just about enough positive here to outweigh the negative. While the film never takes itself seriously & it's good fun there are times when Wild Wild West slips into embarrassing slapstick & some parts are just too goofy like Will Smith bouncing between two trains on a bungee cord, or the revolving billiards table or people randomly emerging from paintings or the silly flying Penny Farthing bike although at other times it's funny like when Will Smith takes on some bad guy's while naked or Will Smith & Kevin Kline trying to outrun two huge spinning blades through a cornfield. The narrative is poor, gaining clues from the burned in image of a decapitated heads eyes, a woman finding out where Loveless is by listening to his female guards talk about how the desert will effect their hair & so on but plot isn't really the strong point of the film.The special CGI computer effects are pretty good, the giant marching mechanical Spider looks great as does the whole film including other machines such as a tank, trains & the Loveless wheelchair which itself grows legs at the end. The production design is great with a period wild west look combined with the whole steam punk technological look with huge pistons, huge metal machines bolted together with huge rivets & the intricacy of the designs are impressive & memorable. There's not much violence here, a few fist fights & a decapitated head. Apparently undergoing expensive re-shoots to add more humour after test audiences didn't know if it was meant to be a comedy or not, maybe that's the reason some of the more silly moments are present. The ending was also re-shot with Will Smith fighting those men in the engine room as originally he only fought & killed those female guards.With a supposed budget of over $150,000,000 Wild Wild West was the most expensive film made in 1999, although shot in oragney desert hues the film looks good with great production values.

After the death of Sean Brody from a shark attack, his mother Ellen (Lorraine Gary) goes with her other son Michael (Lance Guest) to the Bahamas where he works. Ellen has a fear that the Great White shark is stalking her family and sure enough soon there's a beast in the Bahamas.If you read enough reviews you'll come away thinking that JAWS THE REVENGE is one of the worst movies ever made. In fact, many people call it one of the worst films of the decade. Heck, the movie isn't nearly that bad and it's certainly much better than the third film in the series.

Most of these films (Grease being an exception) differ from the traditional musical in that the characters do not normally sing except in situations where people would sing in real life.Dirty Dancing is another film of this type. It is set during the summer of 1963, a date which here carries a certain significance. The late fifties and early sixties, the period immediately preceding the Kennedy assassination and the Vietnam war, are often seen as America's age of lost innocence, a view reflected in other nostalgic movies from the seventies and eighties such as American Graffiti, Grease and Diner.The film tells the story of the Housemans, an affluent Jewish family from New York, spending their summer vacation at a resort in the Catskill Mountains. In particular it tells the story of their 17-year-old daughter Baby and Johnny, a dance instructor working at the resort. (Baby's real name is Frances, although we don't find this out until well into the film). Much of the running time is taken up by dance scenes, and the film is sometimes dismissed as a feelgood movie. Although much of the music is of a cheerful nature and the film has an optimistic ending, I feel that there is more to it than that. The word feelgood suggests something shallow, whereas Dirty Dancing treats some rather deeper themes than is normal in pop-and-dance musicals.One of these themes is that of social class. Here in Britain, we tend to analyse class differences in excruciating detail (not only in the cinema, but in the theatre, on television and in literature too), but in America Hollywood often glosses over the subject. Here, however, it is brought more to the fore. The Housemans are middle-class, Johnny and the rest of the entertainment staff are working-class. Even within the resort there are class differences; some of the staff are middle-class students working in the vacation to fund their university courses, and they are permitted to fraternise with the guests much more than the entertainers. Baby's family disapprove of her relationship with Johnny, but have no objection to her older sister Lisa dating Robbie, a waiter in the holidays but a medical student in term-time.A second theme is that of the relationship between the generations, specifically father-daughter relationships. (Baby's mother plays a less important role in the film). Baby's father Jake, a successful doctor, is a political liberal who supports all the right progressive causes. Baby is planning to study the economics of underdeveloped countries at university and then enter the Peace Corps, and there is a strong implication that this future is one that has been mapped out for her by her family, not chosen by herself. Even her name is taken from that of Frances Perkins, the first woman in the U.S. Cabinet. Despite his political liberalism, however, Jake is much more conservative when it comes to family matters and is a rather authoritarian father. The title of the film reflects the older generation's disapproval of the new styles of dancing popular among the young at this period.A third theme, and a controversial one, is that of abortion. There is a subplot involving Johnny's dance partner Penny, who gets pregnant and has an abortion at a time when it was still illegal. Jake's disapproval of his daughter's lover is based not solely on social class but on the mistaken belief that Johnny was responsible for Penny's pregnancy. It turns out, in fact, that the real culprit was Robbie, a serial womaniser and first class cad; when Jake realises this he does at least have the grace to apologise to Johnny.Dirty Dancing was made on a low budget, and initially the studio (the recently formed Vestron Pictures) did not hold out much hope for it; according to one story the producer's reaction on first seeing the finished film was Burn the negative, and collect the insurance. It had no major stars; Patrick Swayze did not count as such in 1987. Critical reaction was lukewarm, and in some cases much worse than lukewarm; Roger Ebert complained of its idiot plot. Yet was a massive success at the box office, proving that critics can't be right all the time, and remains popular to this day.Part of the reason for its success was doubtless its nostalgic charm; nostalgia for the sixties has been an important part of American and European culture ever since 1970, or at least since 1973 when American Graffiti appeared. The film is, however, about more than just vintage pop music. It was the film that made a star of Swayze, although, strangely, its female lead Jennifer Grey never really had a comparable success in her later films. Perhaps she was a better dancer than she was an actress; although she is good at conveying emotion through gesture and facial expression, her lines are not always delivered clearly.Dirty Dancing is also a sensitive coming of age drama about a young girl finding herself and discovering a strength of character she never knew she had. Certainly, part of its appeal is due to its straightforward morality of be true to yourself and do the right thing. The final scene, where Johnny lifts Baby above his head at the climax of their dance, is one of the great finales of movie history. I am always surprised that it did not give rise to a sequel.

Baby's family disapprove of her relationship with Johnny, but have no objection to her older sister Lisa dating Robbie, a waiter in the holidays but a medical student in term-time.A second theme is that of the relationship between the generations, specifically father-daughter relationships. (Baby's mother plays a less important role in the film). Baby's father Jake, a successful doctor, is a political liberal who supports all the right progressive causes. Baby is planning to study the economics of underdeveloped countries at university and then enter the Peace Corps, and there is a strong implication that this future is one that has been mapped out for her by her family, not chosen by herself. Even her name is taken from that of Frances Perkins, the first woman in the U.S. Cabinet. Despite his political liberalism, however, Jake is much more conservative when it comes to family matters and is a rather authoritarian father. The title of the film reflects the older generation's disapproval of the new styles of dancing popular among the young at this period.A third theme, and a controversial one, is that of abortion. There is a subplot involving Johnny's dance partner Penny, who gets pregnant and has an abortion at a time when it was still illegal. Jake's disapproval of his daughter's lover is based not solely on social class but on the mistaken belief that Johnny was responsible for Penny's pregnancy. It turns out, in fact, that the real culprit was Robbie, a serial womaniser and first class cad; when Jake realises this he does at least have the grace to apologise to Johnny.Dirty Dancing was made on a low budget, and initially the studio (the recently formed Vestron Pictures) did not hold out much hope for it; according to one story the producer's reaction on first seeing the finished film was Burn the negative, and collect the insurance. It had no major stars; Patrick Swayze did not count as such in 1987. Critical reaction was lukewarm, and in some cases much worse than lukewarm; Roger Ebert complained of its idiot plot. Yet was a massive success at the box office, proving that critics can't be right all the time, and remains popular to this day.Part of the reason for its success was doubtless its nostalgic charm; nostalgia for the sixties has been an important part of American and European culture ever since 1970, or at least since 1973 when American Graffiti appeared. The film is, however, about more than just vintage pop music. It was the film that made a star of Swayze, although, strangely, its female lead Jennifer Grey never really had a comparable success in her later films. Perhaps she was a better dancer than she was an actress; although she is good at conveying emotion through gesture and facial expression, her lines are not always delivered clearly.Dirty Dancing is also a sensitive coming of age drama about a young girl finding herself and discovering a strength of character she never knew she had. Certainly, part of its appeal is due to its straightforward morality of be true to yourself and do the right thing. The final scene, where Johnny lifts Baby above his head at the climax of their dance, is one of the great finales of movie history. I am always surprised that it did not give rise to a sequel. (Unless you count the boring Dirty Dancing Havana Nights, essentially a remake in a more exotic setting). 7\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Music, Romance"},{"date":"18 June 2010","score":"","review":" This is what happens when you don't get in to see the film you intended. There we were, looking at alternatives, and I say lets see this. Why? Isn't it obvious? Neil Jordan, Bruce Robinson, both awesome at what they do, Robert Downey Junior, great actor. All I can say is I have never lived picking this film down with my mate and whenever I try to say anything about his taste, he reminds me I picked this. It isn't scary, it isn't interesting, there is no suspense. Maybe Robinson was operating out of his comfort zone, but this film is truly appalling, boring, and occasionally laughably silly. If you want to see something vaguely like this, see 'Fallen' with Denzel Washington, which is much better. Stay away from this.

All the strengths he was gathering as a filmmaker came together in this brilliant satire of (among other things) 19th century Russian literature, war, epic films about war, Ingmar Bergman, etc. etc. It's very very smart, and very very funny.An amazing mix of sophisticated intellectual verbal comedy, parody, low and high-brow visual gags (from speeded up film of bopping a character repeatedly over the head with a bottle, to homages to great images from early Russian films) , terrific cinematography, and some real ideas, both political and philosophical. Diane Keaton is wonderful, and fully comes into her own as Allen's on screen equal partner. And the look of the film shows the deep visual sophistication that would become a hallmark of the next phase of Allen's career; Annie Hall, Manhattan, etc. With this film Allen completed his journey from brilliant joke teller to brilliant director-writer. It would be his next film, Annie Hall, that would make the world realize he was a world class filmmaker. But you can see the all groundwork laid here, and have a lot of fun in the process.It's shocking to me that as of this writing, the DVD seems to be out-of-print in the U.S. I can only assume that's a temporary situation, but you might want to try and grab a copy now, just in case.

He is the greatest athlete of all time, and a true genius, artist, mystic and philosopher. It was a great pity, he died so young. He would have been around 70 today. He was a renaissance-genius from a great time in human history. I think, this movie is way better than Enter the Dragon because you can watch the whole movie from start to finish, whereas no one (I think) will watch all the scenes of his other movies, I mean, in Enter the Dragon, there's a lot of stuff which is not about Bruce Lee, and doesn't seem to be about the plot at all, and his other movies, also have these minor mistakes, but The Way of the Dragon does not. You can watch it again and again. Also it contains the great scene with Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee fighting. Probably the single most amazing scene with Bruce. His other movies contain great scenes, and Enter the Dragon is great also because it's the only one where we hear his real voice. Nora Miao is also very talented, and does an extremely good job in The Way of the Dragon. All things considered, this is an epic masterpiece which should be on art-museums all over the world. It is an image of the 20th century that we cannot afford to miss.
