During one of the assignments a bomb goes off in a Dallas building but it turns out due to an informant(played by Martin Landau) that the bomb was actually a cover up for the dead bodies in the building that had a virus of extra terrestrial origin. What happens then is the stuff that X-Files is known for(most notably the mythology episodes) government conspiracies, possible aliens, and black oil.Fight the Future acts as a bridge for the gap between seasons five and six but also tries and fails to hook in casual viewers who have never seen an X-Files episode. It's very clear that this movie is for the hardcore fans of the TV show mostly because there is very little exposition on who's who or what's going on unless you have watched the TV show. Despite that flaw I do believe that this is a good extended episode movie. Unlike most movies based on TV shows Fight the Future extends the plot with a higher budget and good storytelling of The X-Files variety. (Although parts of the plot borrow from Ridly Scott's Alien but I'm not complaining) But a few things don't make sense like the bee that gets stuck in Scully's shirt then stings her hours later in Mulder's apartment or the confusing connection between the black oil and the aliens in the movie. But then again, The X-Files never really explained everything and always left things ambiguous in the show which was one of the reasons for me why the show was so good when I watched it on Netflix.David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are great as always as Mulder and Scully. Their chemistry was also one of the things that made the show great and the emotional payoff in the movie will only make sense if you watch the TV show. Martin Landau is always great in a lot of things that he does and the informant he does is a good role. Then there's Willian B. Davis as the Cigarete Smoking Man and what can I say the guy was perfect for the role because he had that mysterious atmosphere about him.Fight The Future is a well directed and well made movie despite some plot holes, inconsistencies and its inability to bring in new viewers unless they've watched the TV show. I enjoyed it but its for the fans only.

Rocky whose nickname is the Italian Stallion, is joined by a supporting cast of his best friend Paulie (Burt Young), his love interest Adrian (Talia Shire), his tough spoken trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith), and his biggest opponent ever faced in a boxing ring Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers).Rocky Balboa is a small time street thug that survives by collecting debts for a local loan shark and taking low paying fights in a local fight club. Rocky sees himself as a bum, and that is reinforced many times throughout the movie when many people refer to him as a bum including his trainer and father figure Mickey. Rocky does have a dream to be more in life and this can be seen in the symbolism shown in the names of Rocky's pets, his two turtles, Cuff & Links, and his fish, Mobey Dick. Rocky sees the Cuff links as a status of wealth, and Mobey Dick as being the biggest fish in the boxing world. While you may see Rocky as a tough guy, his image is softened when he does not have the heart to follow through with breaking the thumb of a person that fails to fulfill his debt to the local loan shark, or in Rocky's love for animals, which leads him to meet his love interest, Adrian. Rocky's life changes when Apollo Creed the Heavy Weight Champion of the World, comes to town to promote a fight offering a virtual unknown a shot at the Heavy Weight title. It becomes obvious that Apollo does not consider Rocky a real contender because we never really see him train for the fight. This is reinforced when Apollo's trainer sees Rocky on a news segment and tells Apollo he needs to come take a look at the guy he's going to be fighting. Apollo dismisses his trainer's suggestion by talking about business investments to others in the room.As Rocky trains for the fight you see his progression during the training and know he is ready for the biggest fight of his life as he sprints to the top of the long stairway to the Philadelphia Art Museum, backed by the inspirational song Gonna Fly Now by Bill Conti. Rocky and Apollo Creed meet in the ring and it is obvious this is just a show to Apollo, but he soon finds out he may also be in the biggest fight of his life when Rocky knocks him to the mat for the first time in his career. The fight has its dramatic up's and down's but goes the distance for a split decision. Rocky may not have won the fight, but he wins in life, putting behind his image of being a bum and giving him a shot at his dream of wealth and success. Rocky is a Rags to Riches story much like Cinderella Man (2005), it gives us hope that with the right opportunities anyone can be someone.
