[{"date":"7 June 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Election (1999) written and directed by Alexander Payne, is a movie that stumbles along trying to find its niche. It's sort of funny, but not quite, sort of serious, but not quite, and filled with random sexuality and sexual dialog that don't really work.Both lead actors do well enough--Matthew Broderick as high school teacher Jim McAllister, and Reese Witherspoon as his student Tracy Flick. The problem is that the director didn't know how to shape the movie into a coherent film. The film goes one way, than another way, then a third way, then it ends.As the movie stumbles forward, there's one serious scripting mistake--a new major character (the student who counts the votes) emerges in the last ten minutes of the film. He plays a crucial role. He's one of the few honest people in the movie. Where did he come from? Why hadn't we met him before?I think that this film is a mess and it's not worth seeing. It's really not worth reviewing, except as a service to those who might be thinking about watching it. My advice--find a better movie.
