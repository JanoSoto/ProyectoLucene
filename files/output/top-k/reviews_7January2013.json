But....HG Wells is one of my favorite authors, not so much that he was an exceptionally good writer, more that he had exceptionally good concepts - many are still relevant to today with some changes for advancements in science. Take the Island of Dr. Moreau and apply it to DNA research. Think War of the Worlds and how cautious NASA is to not spread organisms from Earth to Mars. Knowing what the book is about, I couldn't sit through this movie and just enjoy it because all I can think is, That's not what happens! Granted the book might not translate well into a movie, I think, it would take more skill anyway. I have seen the 1960's version and it is closer to this version than the book also. So I am going to talk about the book so you can understand my protestations.The book the Time Machine is a joke! Literally, it is a joke, a satire of modern society. Wells was British and he is making fun of the aristocracy saying they are lazy pretty fools who would only be useful if they were food for the working class man. Humanity has evolved into two distinct species. The Eloi are pretty, lazy, carefree and stupid - they are the descendants of aristocrats. The morlocks are industrious, resourceful, and hardworking who due to certain events have been forced to live underground - the working man. The eloi are able to survive because the morlocks provide for them, do you see the satire? The time traveler in the book prefers the morlocks and holds the elois in contempt - yup, he prefers the creepy underground-dwelling night creatures who eat the eloi. Why? Because they are hard-workers as opposed to the eloi who engage in folly all day long. The eloi Weena (now Mara) who follows the time traveler around gets left in the woods to either be burned to death or captured by the morlocks and guess what? The time traveler isn't sure what her fate is nor is he too worried about it. So, leave it to cinema to praise the pretty idiot and kill the hard working man. I'm guessing an American audience is what inspired the change and removed the symbolism. We think of wealth as something attainable through innovation and hard work. We believe in social mobility and don't see being rich as something simply bestowed by inheritance (though sometimes it is). Ane we also don't have an aristocracy. If you liked the movie, you might not want read the book.

One major difference between the book and the movies that many people don't understand is that in the first one Rambo does not kill because he has honor and was in a non-combat situation.

This very lean action movie has a simple story Rambo going back to Nam to rescue the boys left behind and blowing the Commies to smithereens on his way out. The way the action was shot and cut has been aped so many times this film doesn't even feel original anymore, but if you can appreciate the origin of action trends look no further than this movie ground zero for pure 80s action. This movie has a lot going for it, not least of which are editors Mark Goldblatt and cinematographer Jack Cardiff the latter a legend and the former would become one. The editing is amazingly timed and coherent, making for a great visual narrative. Many people complain the story makes no sense, but they also don't know their history. The story plays as a Rambo version of Bo Gritz's P.O.W. mission, giving Vets a cinematic redemption for the war and P.O.W. issue. Even Regean himself canceled some P.O.W. missions because he was afraid that the secret wars of Laos and Cambodia would receive too much attention.

Off the top of my head, I can't think of any others that stand out than this movie. Balto (1995), was loosely based off the real life events of an actual husky dog of the same name. The only difference is that the story was changed slightly to give the character of Balto a little more background. That is why it's loosely based off the actual events. Kudos to the four writers because it made this movie very enjoyable.Here, Balto lives on the edge of a town because he's not a husky. Yet somehow, everyone in the town, including the humans know his name? How is this possible (this is really the only thing I didn't understand)? His ancestry comes from dog\/wolf, which leaves him in a bad spot because no one wants to trust him and the snooty pure bread husky dogs don't want a mutt joining their dog team. What Balto dreams most of, is running with the husky dogs and pulling the sleds they pull. And little does he know, but his chance will come sooner than he thinks, when a virus breakout comes on the town and he decides to fetch the medicine for the sick.The cast in this film is horrendously good too. Kevin Bacon voices our hero, Balto. Bacon is able to make his role really sound courageous and emotional when it needs to be and that's good. Voicing his love interest is Bridget Fonda as a little girl's husky named Jenna. Even if this is Fonda's first time doing voice acting, she did a great job. She knows how to give Jenna the right tone of voice and emotion at the same time. And I got to admit, Jenna and Balto make an adorable dog couple. Thank you animation department! Let's also not forget our antagonist named Steele voiced by famous voice actor, Jim Cummings. Cummings, who can do this work in his sleep, also gives a convincing performance as the thickheaded, husky with way too much hubris.And along with Steele are always the knuckle head followers of the antagonist. All of which have their own quirkiness about them, which make them funny. But that's not all. Accompanying Balto on his travels are three other friends. Two are a duo of polar bears named Muk and Luk, which are both voiced by musician Phil Collins. Surprisingly, even Collins gives a memorable performance. But the character I found the most entertaining when it came to comic relief was Boris the goose (the other friend) played by Bob Hoskins. Boris is such a great character because of how well he knows Balto and the problems that he faces. It is because of that, that he does his best to make sure his closest friend is in good hands. If you don't fall for Boris, I don't know what will.The art department did a nice job at keeping the view big and broad. Since the setting was in Alaska, it is only respective that the picture be epic looking. Mainly because, Alaska is epic period. Also I like the sounds a lot. Cracking ice to crunching snow. The one sound that I got chills from was hearing the wolves howl. I couldn't stop from getting goosebumps. I have no clue why but it gave me the shivers and that made me like it more. Adding to that was the soundtrack provided by composer James Horner and boy did it work. Excluding a few previous works that Horner has made that were mishaps, Horner really knows how to evoke the right emotions at the right time. It made watching Balto fun and invigorating.The characters alone is what makes the cake in this movie. The icing to the cake is James Horner's music, the grand backgrounds and involving sound effects.

The action is bad. The plot is bad, and the contrived romance between Padme and Anakin is so awful that it essentially ruins the story of the prequel trilogy (since it rests so heavily upon the romance between those two). It has a little bit of value in the first viewing, largely because you expect its nonsensical plot to lead somewhere. Instead, however, it remains a mess that does almost nothing to advance the trilogy's story. The biggest failure with Attack of the Clones is that it leaves so much unfinished that the third movie had to cover every bit of ground that was supposed to be covered in three separate movies. The prequel trilogy fails its main task &#x96; to tell a convincing story about how the once noble Anakin Skywalker was seduced by the dark side to become one of the most heinous movie villains of all time. It fails miserably, and the biggest culprit is this lousy second movie. Instead of progressing this difficult story, Lucas spent this entry of the trilogy keeping computer animators employed and boring the audience.The plot of Attack of the Clones is broken. It starts off with a mystery &#x96; who is trying to assassinate Senator Amidala? The answer, which you are given about 3\/4 of the way through the movie, is disappointing and nonsensical. The entire assassination plot makes no sense whatsoever. In fact, assassinating Padme would actually hurt the cause of the bad guys. This part of the plot is a disaster of epic proportions. The original trilogy made Obi-wan and Anakin out to be best of friends. It is this friendship that made Anakin's betrayal that much harder to take. In addition, the original trilogy implied that it was partially Obi-wan's fault, because he arrogantly tried to train Anakin himself. Thus, Obi-wan ended up as a somewhat tragic figure who achieved redemption through Luke. Does Attack of the Clones do a good job of telling this back story? No, it does not. Absolute, pure 100%, unadulterated fail. Anakin and Obi-wan never come across as friends. What little screen time they share is mostly spent bickering. The element of tragedy that comes from one friend betraying another is completely ruined. In addition, Anakin is simply going through typical Jedi training. The guilt that Obi-wan feels over Anakin turning into Darth Vader is ruined too.The Phantom Menace had some pretty bad writing and plot holes, but Attack of the Clones is worse in every way except for the de-emphasis of Jar Jar. Lucas, though he never admitted it publicly, clearly realized his mistake with Jar Jar after the first movie, and made him a very minor character in this movie. Other than that though, this movie is a step backward in every way except for the CGI budget. Especially weak is the action in this movie. Attack of the Clones doesn't even provide shallow entertainment. The first action scene is an overly long, pointless, boring chase where Anakin and Obi-wan chase a bounty hunter across a crowded CGI sky. The Phantom Menace had CGI, but it generally supported the story. The lame Coruscant chase scene is where the trilogy crosses the line and the story starts supporting the CGI. Later, there is one good scene where Obi-wan faces off against a bounty hunter. Then, at the end, there is a massive CGI lightsaber orgy involving a hundred jedi and a few hundred robots. It is incomprehensible and unexciting. There are so many lightsabers, so many laser blasts, and so many enemies on screen that there is no way to follow the scene. That scene is followed by another gratuitous CGI battle between two large armies. Like the lame lightsaber fight, it is full of flashing lights and explosions that mean nothing to viewer, who can barely tell the good guys from the bad. *Yawn* There is a poorly choreographed lightsaber fight at the end between two Jedi and a dark side dude too. It features lots of close-ups and quick edits in an attempt to hide the fact that the elderly actor in the scene has no business being in an action movie. Is there anything that works in this movie? There are a few parts that aren't horrible, I guess. As I mentioned above, the battle between Obi-wan and the bounty hunter is pretty exciting. Christopher Lee's Count Dooku character is a bright spot too. He has one great scene, in particular, where he tries to tempt Obi-wan to join him by revealing that the evil emperor is behind everything. Keeping Count Dooku's loyalties a mystery to the viewer until the end is the lone successful accomplishment of this movie. Attack of the Clones could have been okay if the romance between Padme and Anakin had been even slightly convincing. It isn't. It is terrible. It is apparent to the viewer throughout the movie that the romance is entirely contrived for the sake of continuity with the original trilogy. After all, somebody has to have Anakin's babies, right? The two characters have no chemistry. When they finally declare their love for each other, it is one of those moments where if you are watching the movie with somebody else, you feel embarrassed, as if that person will think less of you for watching this schlock. The lousy romance affects the next movie too, because Anakin's turning to the dark side depends on it. If the romance isn't convincing, then neither is Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader. It is mind-boggling that a movie with a script this bad could be put into production. The CGI budget could have been cut in half, and a tenth of that money could have been used to hire a decent writer. It would have made for a much better film. Attack of the Clones is horrible.

In fact, it's a little more intense than some people might expect. It marked the transition of screenwriter Chris Columbus (Gremlins, Young Sherlock Holmes) into directing, and stars an incredibly appealing Elisabeth Shue as Chris, a high school senior who, unable to go on a date with her boyfriend (Bradley Whitford), reluctantly agrees to take a babysitting gig, even as she feels she's getting a little old for that sort of thing. Her charge is young Sara (Maia Brewton), a kid with a fixation on comic book character Thor, and the girl's older brother is Brad (Keith Coogan), who's got something of a crush on Chris. Chris expects a rather quiet night, but is pulled into one nightmare after another when she decides to come to the aid of her desperate friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller). She, Sara, and Brad, along with Brad's obnoxious buddy Daryl (Anthony Rapp), end up pursued by psychotic criminals (led by a genuinely spooky John Davis Chandler), caught up in a gang fight, spending time at a frat party, taken for a ride by a crazed tow truck driver (John Ford Noonan), and coming dangerously close to being discovered by Sara's and Brad's parents. The good thing is just how well all of this flows - even at an hour and 43 minutes, there's no filler, just a wild story that moves from one episode to another. The true key to its success is how engaging the cast is, though. Shue does well in her first starring role, Brewton is cute, Coogan is likable, and Rapp is frequently hilarious even if playing kind of a clichéd role. The film also works as a collection of talented actors near the beginning of their careers in addition to Miller, who has her own night of horrors while waiting at the bus station, and Whitford, there's Calvin Levels as helpful car thief Joe Gipp, Vincent D'Onofrio as muscular garage mechanic Dawson, George Newbern as nice guy college student Dan, Lolita Davidovich as an air headed gal at the party, and Clark Johnson as a gang leader. The show stopping scene of course is the one where blues master Albert Collins, in a special appearance, won't let Chris and company leave his stage without singing the blues, and they belt out a ditty about their babysitting woes. (Southside Johnny also puts in an appearance as well.) This movie is certainly never boring, delivering some good laughs and keeping up a high energy level right up to its feel-good ending. Recommended. Eight out of 10.

It marked the transition of screenwriter Chris Columbus (Gremlins, Young Sherlock Holmes) into directing, and stars an incredibly appealing Elisabeth Shue as Chris, a high school senior who, unable to go on a date with her boyfriend (Bradley Whitford), reluctantly agrees to take a babysitting gig, even as she feels she's getting a little old for that sort of thing. Her charge is young Sara (Maia Brewton), a kid with a fixation on comic book character Thor, and the girl's older brother is Brad (Keith Coogan), who's got something of a crush on Chris. Chris expects a rather quiet night, but is pulled into one nightmare after another when she decides to come to the aid of her desperate friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller). She, Sara, and Brad, along with Brad's obnoxious buddy Daryl (Anthony Rapp), end up pursued by psychotic criminals (led by a genuinely spooky John Davis Chandler), caught up in a gang fight, spending time at a frat party, taken for a ride by a crazed tow truck driver (John Ford Noonan), and coming dangerously close to being discovered by Sara's and Brad's parents. The good thing is just how well all of this flows - even at an hour and 43 minutes, there's no filler, just a wild story that moves from one episode to another. The true key to its success is how engaging the cast is, though. Shue does well in her first starring role, Brewton is cute, Coogan is likable, and Rapp is frequently hilarious even if playing kind of a clichéd role. The film also works as a collection of talented actors near the beginning of their careers in addition to Miller, who has her own night of horrors while waiting at the bus station, and Whitford, there's Calvin Levels as helpful car thief Joe Gipp, Vincent D'Onofrio as muscular garage mechanic Dawson, George Newbern as nice guy college student Dan, Lolita Davidovich as an air headed gal at the party, and Clark Johnson as a gang leader. The show stopping scene of course is the one where blues master Albert Collins, in a special appearance, won't let Chris and company leave his stage without singing the blues, and they belt out a ditty about their babysitting woes. (Southside Johnny also puts in an appearance as well.) This movie is certainly never boring, delivering some good laughs and keeping up a high energy level right up to its feel-good ending.

But you've got to hand it to him just for popping the fantastic story idea. Following juggles quite a lot of story ideas in its runtime of 70 minutes but somehow the puzzle still remains incomplete by the end of it.A young writer (Jeremy Theobald) follows people around London to find inspiration for the characters for his first novel. He follows specific people and never the same person again, just to see where they go and what they do but decides never to obsess about or get curious as to why they do what they do. Those are the rules he abides by. One day, he decides to follow a clean cut, smart-looking fellow who goes by the name Cobb (Alex Haw). Cobb quickly figures out that he is being followed and confronts the young writer. Cobb introduces himself as a thief, who burgles the houses of people he finds interesting and asks the young writer to accompany him on his burglaries. The young writer becomes infatuated with a young woman (Lucy Russell) whose house he burgles along with Cobb and then things start to go wrong for him.With a budget so low, a film with a story as gutsy as this deserves high praise. To be honest, Following starts off spectacularly, skimming the streets of London with inspiring cleverness that makes the city look as tempting as it makes it look dangerous, and Nolan slowly builds the tense atmosphere that the narrative requires. The writing in the first few sequences is outstanding, and Nolan delves into the story as soon as the film begins. The two lead characters, the young man and Cobb, are meticulously written so that the viewer gets a useful insight of what they are thinking. And that's one very important aspect of the film  You need to guess what the characters are thinking even though they don't voice it out loud. And those are pretty much all the positives I have to say about the film.Somewhere in the midst of the narrative, the film cripples. And that's very unfortunate because Nolan's got some great ideas up his sleeve, and he makes a big flaw of letting one on too soon. After that, the film turns into a drama instead of a mystery for the plot continues to unfold in a frustratingly predictable manner. What's left to enjoy is some kind of twist that unfurls in the last sequence, managing a graceful conclusion to a decent feature. But the plot does not attempt to avert what's about to happen and the conclusion does not differ much from the one you might've guessed sometime during the film.Of the performances, Theobald and Haw are convincing. Haw, who plays the cunning Cobb, certainly looks the part and delivers well. The same goes for Theobald. Russell, on the other hand, lacks the urgency that her character was required to throw up in a traumatic situation. Playing the role of a seductress, she comes off as wooden instead of charming, thus remains totally unconvincing in her performance. Following has compelling wit and diabolical cleverness stashed up somewhere in its stupendously structured plot. The non-linear narrative is slightly soporific though the style and writing are exemplary. It is a film that won't disappoint you though when the plot concerns a mystery, I expect it to keep me guessing till the very end. Sadly, Following fails there.

Usually the insane, chaotic style like in Memories of Matsuko is used to make the story more interesting and offering a new way to tell your regular stories.

Those two sick, demented freaks we have for main characters don't suffer fate worse than death... Instead they kill the only character I liked (Robert Downey Jr.) and live happily ever after...In other words, Natural Born Killers is failure in my eyes. It fails both as a character study and as a media satire. Oliver Stone spends more time on over the top visuals and brutal violence rather than actually examining the characters or satirizing our mass media... The last 30 minutes are a disjointed mess that the only thing it has going for is over the top performances and loads of brutal, tasteless violence. Basically if Natural Born Killers were exploitation film but not a satire of mass media and violence than I would have been more or less fine with it. In an exploitation film you don't need to have any context or reason to anything. It's made for pure shock value to cash in on certain trends, society issues or film genres.In the end I think that Natural Born Killers is a pretty repulsive and ugly film that fails at everything it tries to achieve.

","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"7 January 2013","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Out of the three prequel movies, Star Wars Episode 1 has taken the most heat over the years from Star Wars fans, and is widely perceived as being the worst of them. I disagree pretty heavily with this sentiment though. I believe that Episode I was perceived that way because, at the time of its release, the expectations were much higher. It is, actually, a decent movie, because it retains more elements of the Star Wars formula than the two movies that followed it. It has some strong points which made it somewhat popular when it came out, and it has, by far, the best action scenes of the prequel trilogy.Let's get one thing out of the way right off the bat. There is absolutely no defending the Jar Jar Binks character. None. He is probably the worst character in the history of film, and a product of the grossest miscalculation ever made in the medium. He is a terrible annoyance, and every single scene where he has dialog is a failure. Jar Jar is one of the many examples in this trilogy of how Lucas desperately needed some devil's advocates to impose some restraint, instead of toadies who refused to question his godawful decisions. Sadder though, Jar Jar is also an example of something that could have gone right in the film. Star Wars Episode I is a story about two completely different races of beings finding common ground to fight a common foe. Jar Jar, at some level, should have been an important story link. Instead, he is the product of George Lucas's obsession with slapstick humor that nobody above the age of four could possibly enjoy.This is an important point that I am trying to make. Lucas is almost universally criticized by Star Wars fans as being a sell-out with this trilogy. Every bad decision is chalked up to a desire to sell toys. However, when I listen to the commentary on the DVDs, I get a sense that this is not the case. I get the impression that George Lucas wanted to tell a great story with some consistent themes. The problem is that Lucas seems to have the mentality of a five year old when it comes to telling those stories. A couple of these themes are 1. Symbiosis &#x96; beings in nature working together for a common good 2. A technologically inferior army defeating a technologically superior foe The concept of the Gungans and the Naboo banding together to fight the droid army fits both of those themes. It could have worked, but Lucas bungled it by making Jar Jar a retarded version of Bugs Bunny who talks like a slave.Let's talk about what does work in this film. The best part about it is that it has a few terrific action scenes. The action scenes in the Phantom Menace are vastly superior to the action scenes in Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith for two reasons1. The move along the story. There is a clear purpose and objective to each one of them. The other two movies of the trilogy had pointless, boring chases and battle scenes that could have been removed from the story without losing anything of value.2. Choreography. Like the scenes in the original trilogy, the action can be followed by the viewer. It isn't a blur of meaningless CGI where you can't tell how many good guys or bad guys there are, where everyone is, and who is winning. The lightsaber fight at the end is spectacular. I love the pod racing scene, despite the conventional wisdom that it was a scene manufactured to sell video games. Even the large scale CGI battle between the Gungans and the droid army is watchable.The Phantom Menace has never gotten its due credit for being a great action movie. For that matter, the original Star Wars trilogy has never gotten enough recognition in that department either. So much commentary gets devoted to the characters and stories of Star Wars that people forget how cool and exciting they were. The Phantom Menace doesn't match up in terms of storytelling or characters, but it does match up when it comes to action.If you aren't convinced, then watch the lightsaber fight at the end of The Phantom Menace, and compare it to any scene with a lightsaber in Episode II or III. Casting a martial arts expert as Darth Maul was a wise choice. If you ask me, the prequels would have been better with more martial arts-inspired lightsaber fights. The duels in Episodes II and III suck. The scenes with lightsabers in those movies are poorly choreographed garbage between guys who look like kids playing with glow sticks.Another part of this movie that works is the two Jedi, Obi-wan Kenobi and Qui-gon Jin. They are the pillars that keep the story from collapsing into a pile of infantile garbage. They have good chemistry, and the master-student relationship is much better realized in this movie than in the latter two movies. Liam Nesson brings a great presence to the role of Jedi Master &#x96; a role that he is now typecast in because of his success in this movie. Ewan McGregor brings some presence as a young Obi-wan too, although he is badly underused in this movie.Does the Phantom Menace have some pretty big flaws? Yes. Do these problems make Star Wars I The Phantom Menace a bad movie? Absolutely not, unless you are looking for that to happen. Jar Jar isn't in every scene, and the action is really good. If you are young and watching this whole series for the first time, or if you watched it once a long time ago and your memory of it is a little faded, then give this movie another chance.

It is, actually, a decent movie, because it retains more elements of the Star Wars formula than the two movies that followed it. It has some strong points which made it somewhat popular when it came out, and it has, by far, the best action scenes of the prequel trilogy.Let's get one thing out of the way right off the bat. There is absolutely no defending the Jar Jar Binks character. None. He is probably the worst character in the history of film, and a product of the grossest miscalculation ever made in the medium. He is a terrible annoyance, and every single scene where he has dialog is a failure. Jar Jar is one of the many examples in this trilogy of how Lucas desperately needed some devil's advocates to impose some restraint, instead of toadies who refused to question his godawful decisions. Sadder though, Jar Jar is also an example of something that could have gone right in the film. Star Wars Episode I is a story about two completely different races of beings finding common ground to fight a common foe. Jar Jar, at some level, should have been an important story link.

You've got your star protagonist; a young, blonde leading lady, and a real- world scenario that provides plenty of his trademark suspense.In one of those premises that is just meant for film, Jimmy Stewart is an injured photographer who gets interested in his apartment block. And for the first half hour, that's all that happens. We meet his not-quite- mutual girlfriend Lisa, charmingly played by Grace Kelly. Then we look at the neighbours and see a bit of who they are. One in particular catches Jeffries' eye, a salesman who likes to take late night walks...And thus the caper begins. How can you build a case from an apartment, bound to a wheelchair? That's where all of the action takes place, leading to a certain enclosure in the film, but also a sense of home. The question becomes, did he even do it? Jeffries works to prove it, but we also need convincing too. And Detective Doyle doesn't believe it, and our own loyalty wavers too. Once the film picks up, and it slowly picks up until the tense finale, we aren't quite sure which way the story will go.First, eat while watching the film. The first act is slow, and maybe even a bit too long. Second, it's certainly dated, more so than say Psycho or Rope (I give Rope the slight edge to this film). Certain elements, including one very important camera flash, breaks the otherwise sublime tension that had been building to a crescendo the entire film. The falling action is also quite weak, an issue that soured the ending of North by Northwest as well. If you've enjoyed Hitchcock's other work and look past these issues then Rear Window will knock you out, but in the grand comparison these are issues that other films don't have.Is Rear Window a great film? Yes. Is it one of the absolute best films ever made? Not quite.

Actually, although The Odd Couple can be seen as the original or, at least, the one that popularized this theme, it isn't that much more sophisticated or unexpected than any of the others. Felix and Oscar are very nearly cartoon characters, with the defining feature (neat vs. messy) as extreme as humanly possible. The big difference, though, is in the comedic duo of Lemmon and Matthau (in their second collaboration) who make these characters real, hilarious and so very lovable.The Odd Couple was adapted from the popular Neil Simon play, but as funny as the play is, it takes a back seat - this is Lemmon and Matthau's show, and they made the most of it. These two had perfect chemistry and comedic timing, but unlike other great comedic duos - Abbott and Costello, Laurel and Hardy - Lemmon and Matthau were both accomplished dramatic actors as well, and in all their films they managed to create characters who are extreme, polar opposites but also very relatable and very convincing as a pair of good friends.

Mix a sexy devil, a clueless anti-hero, some wishes gone terribly wrong, and voilà!It's funny, with each wish and consequences well devised. The dialogs are good and the script well thought out.Unfortunately, the movie over all feels a little cheap when you see it for the second time. It's not enough to stop me, but... What create that impression is that they reuse the same 5 actors to do different secondary characters. Also, some special effects are not as good as they could have been, and most scenes feel a bit empty.
