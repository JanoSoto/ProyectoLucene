In terms of film-making and the message of the film, it is very good, and probably excels some films on many different levels. However, in terms of the pace of the film, it is slow and generally boring on several occasions.Liv Tyler plays Lucy Harmon, a young virgin girl who visits friends of her late mother in Tusacny, Italy. These are an odd bunch, not least the chronically ill Alex (Jeremy Irons), who tells her not to give up on her search for her father. While she is there she also intends to sleep with the boy whom she shared her first kiss with and who she has been writing letters to. In the end, however, she makes a very interesting discovery about who has been sending replies.Liv Tyler is not really my favourite actress - I still feel damned after watching her gut-wrenching performance in Armageddon - but here she plays the character of Lucy brilliantly. She is sweet, virginal and intelligent enough to make you believe that not only will she succeed in her quest, but also she will not be pushed around by anyone, or taken advantage of. I was also impressed by the performance of Jermey Irons, whose rather obscure CV has taken him from Godspell to Die Hard With A Vengeance. But here I warmed to his character, and the relationship between these two characters was played very well.But there are many parts of the film where you just have to sit back and realise that the scenery is the true star of the film. The beauty of the Tuscany countryside is breathtaking and a delight to watch. This does, however, seem to be played with a bit too much - we want to see a new chapter in Lucy's story, not some moving postcards that Bernado Betolucci, who directed, put in to make the film longer.This film will be remembered, however, not for the strength of the acting of some of the actors - incidentally, Sinead Cusack is also very good - but because of one or two risqué scenes. The final one of these is the climax if you will of Lucy's quest, and I must admit it was rather a touching scene to watch. But personally I feel the strength of the film is elsewhere, and not just with this one scene By the way, I am not ignoring the earlier risqué scene, where Lucy poses rather interestingly for a portrait, but then again I feel the strength does not lie here. It's reputation has been sadly built on these one or two scenes.In conclusion then, I would not recommend this film as something to watch with a partner or friend, unless you've been to Tuscany and want to reminisce.4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 March 2005","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Stealing Beauty is an interesting film.

He has to do something, any suggestions? Of course! Our tin friend gets his gun and shoots all the gangsters. Don't forget he's invincible; bullets make him no harm, never misses a shot and things like that.

A once vibrant Gothic tale of an estranged super-hero turned into a campy piece of crap. Batman was becoming like the 1960's series. While I like Adam West and the ludicrously hip series, the originality and darkness of the Gothic novel influenced movies was gone. Joel Schumacher's Batman Forever and then Batman and Robin hath destroyed one of my favorite characters. Nevertheless, even if the sequels deteriorate and degenerate even more, there will always be Batman.At the core of this movie is Michael Keaton. Before, I saw the film I questioned the casting of him, but in retrospect, it was a brilliant decision. He is a character that is believable as a man violently thrown into the fray early as a child. After watching his parents become the victim of a brutal crime, Bruce Wayne creates a schizophrenic personality to combat the evils in the world. Possibly to cover up his guilt of not being able to save his parents. Keaton is perfect as a balding, small, slightly shy business man Bruce Wayne and the angst ridden Batman. The worst casting would have been to hire a pretty boy to play Batman.In order for the movie to succeed there has to be a vile and virulent villain. Enter Jack Nicholson. He said he took this role for aesthetic reasons. I believe they were to rompish in his role while collecting a huge paycheck. That is what is noticeable from his performance -- he is having fun. His Joker is one of the great screen villains of the past two decades.The Joker was once Jack Napier, henchman of Carl Grissom. Grissom sets-up Napier to be arrested, over a girl, and Batman was responsible for tossing Jack Napier into a vat of bleach. He survived; however, not intact. His soul and skin had been bleached. Jack was dead, and Batman's nemesis Joker was born.Grizzled character actor Jack Palance plays Grissom in another great supporting role. He even outshines Nicholson in one scene where he grabs him and says Your my number one, guy. On paper, it does not seem like much, but on the screen it is a fabulous scene. The look on Nicholson's face is priceless.When I first saw this film in the theater, the scenery and special effects awed me. I went by myself, because I could not find any companions and spent the evening emerged in this Gothic tale. Gothom City is a dark and doleful town with skyscrapers that reach way atop the atmosphere and look part of a Kafkaesque nightmare. Anton Furst won an Oscar for the production design and Danny Elfman's has a terrific score. While some of the atmosphere is not translated onto the small screen, nevertheless the brilliant and brooding direction of Tim Burton is still relevant. Most of Burton's material is fodder for my cinematic appetite. Ed Wood and Batman Returns are among my favorite movies.Other characters include the love interest (Kim Bassinger) and comic relief (Robert Wuhl). Both are common elements in 'super-hero' movies and are a bit clichéd in this movie though both are acted well enough.

A once vibrant Gothic tale of an estranged super-hero turned into a campy piece of crap. Batman was becoming like the 1960's series. While I like Adam West and the ludicrously hip series, the originality and darkness of the Gothic novel influenced movies was gone. Joel Schumacher's Batman Forever and then Batman and Robin hath destroyed one of my favorite characters. Nevertheless, even if the sequels deteriorate and degenerate even more, there will always be Batman.At the core of this movie is Michael Keaton. Before, I saw the film I questioned the casting of him, but in retrospect, it was a brilliant decision. He is a character that is believable as a man violently thrown into the fray early as a child. After watching his parents become the victim of a brutal crime, Bruce Wayne creates a schizophrenic personality to combat the evils in the world. Possibly to cover up his guilt of not being able to save his parents. Keaton is perfect as a balding, small, slightly shy business man Bruce Wayne and the angst ridden Batman. The worst casting would have been to hire a pretty boy to play Batman.In order for the movie to succeed there has to be a vile and virulent villain. Enter Jack Nicholson. He said he took this role for aesthetic reasons. I believe they were to rompish in his role while collecting a huge paycheck. That is what is noticeable from his performance -- he is having fun. His Joker is one of the great screen villains of the past two decades.The Joker was once Jack Napier, henchman of Carl Grissom. Grissom sets-up Napier to be arrested, over a girl, and Batman was responsible for tossing Jack Napier into a vat of bleach. He survived; however, not intact. His soul and skin had been bleached. Jack was dead, and Batman's nemesis Joker was born.Grizzled character actor Jack Palance plays Grissom in another great supporting role. He even outshines Nicholson in one scene where he grabs him and says Your my number one, guy. On paper, it does not seem like much, but on the screen it is a fabulous scene. The look on Nicholson's face is priceless.When I first saw this film in the theater, the scenery and special effects awed me. I went by myself, because I could not find any companions and spent the evening emerged in this Gothic tale. Gothom City is a dark and doleful town with skyscrapers that reach way atop the atmosphere and look part of a Kafkaesque nightmare. Anton Furst won an Oscar for the production design and Danny Elfman's has a terrific score. While some of the atmosphere is not translated onto the small screen, nevertheless the brilliant and brooding direction of Tim Burton is still relevant. Most of Burton's material is fodder for my cinematic appetite. Ed Wood and Batman Returns are among my favorite movies.Other characters include the love interest (Kim Bassinger) and comic relief (Robert Wuhl). Both are common elements in 'super-hero' movies and are a bit clichéd in this movie though both are acted well enough.

I remember watching it for the first time some ten or fifteen years ago, after reading about it in a martial arts magazine, if memory serves.Plot outline - Biker Harley Davidson (Mickey Rourke), aside with the bike-riding rodeo cowboy Marlboro Man (Don Johnson) and a few other small time crooks robs a money transport, which turns out to be a big mistake when they find out that they got more than they bargained for. And all hell breaks loose...The story of this movie isn't too complicated, but it contains a lot of fighting, gunfire and explosions. Which seem reasonable, since it is an action flick, and therefore should be judged as such, and not compared to other movies with more solid and refined story lines and so on. And as pure action, it is great. Mickey Rourke does a great job portraying the biker who turns out to be a less-than-proficient marksman who couldn't hit a barn even with a sniper scope. Don Johnson does very well as a gun-slinging cowboy - especially since his weapon of choice is a .44 cal Desert Eagle, not the most handy or practical handgun on the market - who would fit in any classical western movie. Together they form a must-be-seen-to-believed duo.To me, this is Rourke's finest performance on the silver screen up to this date - although I have a feeling that this one went straight to the video shelves - and Don Johnson does a great job too, even though I've only seen him in Miami Vice as well as a couple of other movies. We also see a young - and thin - Daniel Baldwin as the goon in charge, and Tom Sizemore as the mobster posing as a respectable business man, with Tia Carrere as his sidekick\/secretary.All in all, and as an action flick, this is as good as any other. Movies in this category often get rather low ratings, and in my eyes the problem is that they aren't judged for what they are, and not compared to other action flicks. Yes, the storyline could be summed up in a few sentences, but come on, that's what action is about - Action. Bullets flying, fists pounding, vehicles exploding. If I want to watch a good drama or thriller, I watch a good drama or thriller.

Sure, it may be a little predictable and a bit 'all been done before' but there is a certain level of originality and uniqueness to it also.For starters it has a fantastic cast and both lead actors (Jolie and Washington)have won Oscars and thats says something. It can't be easy playing a paralysed man and remaining so still and wooden and he plays the frustrations and emotions so realistically that I would imagine a person actually would be like in real life. Jolie is charming, composed and works well with the camera. Her character is convincing enough and this goes for her performance.The support cast is fantastic too, especially Queen Latifa.The film may have the usual iconographic elements found in the psychological thriller genre but they are necessary for it to firstly conform and also progress. 'The Bone Collector' introduces new techniques and a slightly different angle for the viewer. there has to be a certain amount of repetition with this genre for it to work and this is the case for many others, such as romantic comedies and a couple falling in love or teen flicks with a football jock character.I am currently writing my degree dissertation on sexual subjectivity in psychological thrillers and this film is perfect for that. The changing levels of gendered representations is very interesting and both supports and detracts away from the current representations in society.I say, give it a go! Don't listen to people who have already seen it and didn't like it. If I'd have done that then I wouldn't have given it a go and my dissertation would have been short of argument!

Nobody ever had a clue what I was talking about, & looked at me like I was completely crazy, so I finally had to get a subscription to NetFlix, to see it again. I'm a big kid at heart, & enjoyed this movie just as much today, as I did almost 20 years ago. I was always a huge fan of the whole Sci-Fi\/ Time Travel story lines. Flight Of The Navigator, Voyagers, The Time Machine, & Sliders were at the top of my list.About 5 years ago, I was in Florida, & saw the Navigator spaceship just sitting in storage, in a studio junkyard. It was great to see it, but kind of a crappy way to display it. So much more could be done with it. Anyway, sorry to ramble on. If you like the kind of genres that I mentioned above, but haven't seen this movie, I suggest you give it a try.I had forgotten that Sarah Jessica Parker was in this movie, fresh from her Square Pegs look. I read that the kid who starred in this movie (Joey Cramer) only did a handful of movies\/ TV appearances, and dropped from the public eye. His whereabouts are listed as unknown today.Pay attention Disney guys, this needs to be re-released next year for it's 20th anniversary, with cool DVD extra's. Get busy & find him, so you can film segments & comments for the DVD. Hopefully we'll hear from him, Sarah Jessica Parker, & Paul Pee Wee Reubens, as well as other cast members.

Although it is only the beginning of a long journey for all the actors, crew, and director, it sets the pace for what is to come in a superlative way. Each character is presented beautifully, especially Frodo and Gandalf, and you really savor the growth of each one as the movie progresses to its first cliff-hanging end. This is the movie that made me fall in love again with Tolkien's books, and also made me believe in fantasies again, as well. Jackson must go down in history as one of the greatest directors of all time. This is the most personal of the trilogy, as you come to know each character, and begin to care about his or her journey. Who could not help but fall in love with Frodo as he takes on the burden of the ring in his innocence and goodness? Elijah Wood is truly amazing in this role. He seems to have been born to be Frodo. As is true for all the characters Jackson so skillfully developed and steered in the right direction to make film history. Congratulations to everyone involved in creating this epic masterpiece.

Meanwhile, Jamal (played by Redman), motivation comes in the form of his well-meaning, but verbally abusive mother urging him to get his degree so she can place it on the wall by his brothers' Prison-issued Barber Certificate and his sisters' Weave-Masters Degree. Through a turn or events (of course involving weed), the two find themselves as freshmen at Harvard and then the fun begins. From pranks on the freshmen class Dean (involving Pigeons) to a hilarious Pimp (played to the hilt by Mike Epps), with only TWO WOMEN in his stable, the laughs are are never ending! Meth & Red may not win any awards from this movie but I would cast my vote for them as the next candidates for Best Buddy Movie combination. In the tradition of Cheech & Chong, Lewis and Martin, Pryor & Wilder, Harrelson & Snipes... These guys Definitely have that potential.
