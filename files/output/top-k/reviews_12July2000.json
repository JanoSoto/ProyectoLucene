Add to the pros of Goonies its kitschy band of ragtag characters, some of whom stay with you (Sloth, Mouth and the irrepressible Chunk) and some who don't (the older brother, the girls), and you have a movie that stands the test of time, for better or for worse.

But this movie was an offensive, misogynist, anti gay, sexist, and completely racist piece of garbage that did nothing but perpetuate stereotypes and beat already low brow, unfunny jokes into the ground. Was it the Wayans intention to promote this level of thinking? I hope so, because at least on one level they can feel a sense of accomplishment.This was one terrible movie. It didnt even seem like a spoof; it seemed like a bad horror movie, and the way they intended. There was very little irony, nor tongue in cheek wit to keep this thing afloat. The humor did not come from characters nor affectionate nods at past horror movies; where did it come from? This movie employed the same countless sketch comedy gags that this director was using 10 years ago in the Near Beer version of Def Comedy Jam meets SNL (In Living Color). The pop culture references will date this movie beyond belief in about oh, I'd say six months, and the sad thing, the references even for today are squandered.

It doesn't purport to be a dramatization of actual historical events or the lives of historical personages though the inspiration for its plot can certainly be found among historical events. The only historical figure we see in the movie is a briefly glimpsed George Washington.  He doesn't speak and is seen from afar.The story centers around one Benjamin Martin, played by Mel Gibson.  He's a Carolina plantation owner, widower, and hero of the French and Indian War. The movie opens with Martin putting his souvenirs of that war, including an engraved tomahawk, into a trunk and cryptically stating that he fears his sins will come back to haunt him.  Those sins turn about to be organizing an atrocity against the French and their Indian allies.  His role in that event is known to almost everyone except his children, and the memories of war keep him from taking up arms against the British though he thinks the colonies should be independent.  His duty, he maintains, is to protect his family.But a son's willful enlistment in the Continental Army and the brutal actions of the decidedly ungentlemanly Tavington, an officer in the British Dragoons (his character is based on an actual officer nicknamed Bloody Tarleton just as Martin bears more than a passing resemblance to Francis Marion aka The Swamp Fox -- subject of a Disney movie of the same name) violently transforms Martin from a sullen neutral into the sort of violent avenger familiar from many of Gibson's other movie characters (see Hamlet, Riggs, Porter, and Mad Max) and, eventually, into a true patriot.I didn't mind this character arc, expected as it was.  Dramatically it works, and, historically, the brutality and military and diplomatic incompetence of the British did push many a person off the fence during the Revolution and into the arms of the rebellion.There are other things to like in this movie.  Historically, it does a good job in showing that not all the Colonials were pleased to have the French as allies, particularly the older soldiers who fought against them in the sometimes brutal French and Indian War.  The Carolina theater, with its savage guerilla warfare, a civil war where colonist turned on colonist, sometimes for political ends, sometimes to settle personal grudges, is well depicted.  And the movie shows a wide variety of Loyalist, British, and Colonials.  No side is universally brutal in the war.But the latter is part of the movie's problem too.  This movie has too much going on, would have been served by another edit.  Screenwriter Robert Rodat wrote the excellent Saving Private Ryan.  Here, though, free from dramatizing events set against a quite specific historical event, his focus drifts.  At times, he seemed to be trying to write two movies.  One is about the American Revolution and its ideals.  The other is darker and about the practical and moral dilemma of whether leniency or brutality is the best way to bring a guerilla foe to heel.  The latter is the more fascinating movie, but it often overshadows the story of the Revolution.  Indeed, this plot of atrocity and reprisal could have been set in many time periods (including Missouri during the Civil War).The movie also is weighed down by two romantic subplots.  One is a palatable, subtle romance between Gibson and the sister of his dead wife. The other is an intrusive romance between Martin's son and a woman whose main purpose is to satisfy the dramatic dictum that the innocent must suffer.The movie also suffers from a lot of movie cliches  enemies who conveniently go down with one shot except, of course, the villain; many a coincidence; and dramatic entrances at darkest hours as well as some literal flagwaving (though, in the movie's defense, flagbearers at this time were important to not only the morale of the military but also to its tactical deployment and would remain so at least through the Civil War).  Roland Emmerich, never a particularly subtle director (Exhibit One  his Independence Day), delights in sentimental tokens in a way that would warm the heart of a Victorian melodramatist.  Besides the nascent American flag, he drags out  lead soldiers and silver necklaces and uses them not once, not twice, but several times as touchstones of poignancy.I call them cliches.  But maybe these are what other people meant when they referred to the film as old fashioned moviemaking.  However, the film's overuse of slow motion was certainly not old fashioned.Historically, I was slightly bothered by the rather unbelievable congeniality that slaves and freedman showed towards Martin, a slaveholder, and his family.  (Though the movie does accurately show blacks fighting for both sides.)  The flintlock handguns used in the movie also seem to have unbelievable range, accuracy, and lethality.Michael Mann's The Last of the Mohicans depicts the warfare of the period in a more exciting way.  Gettysburg and, of course, Waterloo do a better job showing the terror and tactics of Napoleonic style warfare though this may be the first movie to try and accurately depict the effects of cannonballs on massed formations as we see some decapitations and general maimings.So why do I recommend this movie?  Because, beneath the sentimental excess and dramatic cliches, there is an interesting story of brutal warfare on American soil, and Gibson, in two or three scenes, is allowed to show a genuinely dark character who (rather like Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven) has been reformed by the love of a now dead woman and finds his violent nature again brought to the fore.  And it troubles him and his family.

It's a film I know so well now that it's too easy for me to get into a massive dissection of it.So instead I thought I'd focus on how it first affected me and what it still means to me now.My first knowledge and exposure of this film was surprisingly not a first viewing of it but rather a shocking (for me,I was only 7!) cinema trailer that was showing on British television at the time.A fast cutting trailer(that I've never seen since)comprising mostly of the rushing shots through the forest accompanied by the now famous Evil Dead chase sound and the were going to get you chant. The trailer absolutely terrified me and I had nightmares for weeks, mainly because I had no idea what it all meant and also had never really seen anything but Hammer horror on the TV.When I was old enough to start seeing more risqué' horror(about 12) The Evil Dead was one of the first I saw on video (along with The Exorcist, Mothers day and Halloween 3 bizarrely enough.)What can I say, the film had a profound effect on me and I can safely say it was the one that whetted my appetite and eventual love of horror in the years to follow. Never had I seen such an atmospheric, creepy and sense assaulting, freaked out horror film. Repeated viewings years later only confirmed what an effective low budget this film still is.I recently watched the Bruce Campbell audio commentary on the Elite DVD and all I will say is that his views put paid to all the detractors of the movie. For every one that complains about the supposed shoddy effects, the bad acting and how it's not really scary, these are the same people who queued for Armageddon and Godzilla and sat there numb at 'Blair Witch' waiting for an explosion or sex scene. A film like The Evil Dead reeks of passion, made by people who love films and not fuelled by mass market and greed. The original camera work, the scant disregard for the faint hearted in the audience, the repeated viewing factor, the mastering of equipment because it was all they had to use, the atmosphere (Intentional and un-intentional) and the jet black comedy in this film all put it up there in my all time top five. A must see for any self respecting horror fan.To partly quote Alan Bryce If you don't like this film you have no imagination (talking about Blair Witch) I'd say if you don't find at least something redeeming in this film then you don't like Horror.

Not only has The Matrix abstractly demonstrated today's programmed society and how we need spiritual redemption, but other films like American Beauty and Fight Club demonstrate as part of their narrative that materials and a slave-driving, cubicle-stomping, keyboard-pushing, number-crunching computer existence robs us of our humanity.Rife with religious and biblical inferences, The Matrix serves allegorically what society has become.  Post World War II\/1950's American Dream thinking that the Baby Boomers sold out to in the '70's and '80's is an outdated mode of living for their sons and daughters, who, more or less, will do the same thing.  However, I feel The Matrix shows that there is a slim band of folks out there in the world who refuse to accept being lulled to sleep and choose to live thus repudiating what society says they SHOULD do with their lives--feed the capitalistic machine.Inspiring as it looks, going through an awakening is a hard and painful process that The Matrix demonstrates.  There is the feeling of wasted time, although when asking upon his awakening, Am I dead?, Larry Fishburne responds, Far from it, signaling a birth to a new person, a new life.  As an example  I read an article explaining how more and more dentists, accountants, and lawyers are scrapping the desk\/office job to become personal trainers.  Talk about the other end of the spectrum right? However, this article goes in-depth of how they feel better spiritually about doing something they love to do and realizing how their inner being was bankrupt of any humanity prior to their awakening.To the untrained film theorist, my posit could be construde as hogwash.  I hear chants of IT'S ONLY A MOVIE!! as I write this. However, these stories are not written for the hell of it.  The writer is trying to tell us something; the film-maker does his best to show us.  With media replacing religion as the opiate of the people, it's good to see that film-makers such as these are tapped into and aware of this phenomena to inform us of who we are and where we are headed.
