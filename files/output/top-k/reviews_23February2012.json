Although it can't compare to the horror movies of today for its time it was deemed one of the great horror of it time and was a big box office hit and I can see how that is. It had great cinematography with great lighting and set designs.The camera man should have received an award for the work he did there are a couple scenes were remarkable. The sound was OK the sounds of Frankenstein were OK but could have been a little bit louder and dramatic in my eyes. Boris Karloff was great acting as the Monster and Colin Clive did a great job as Dr. Frankenstein. The set has a feel of Transylvania and reminds me of a show took from this idea called the Munsters.
