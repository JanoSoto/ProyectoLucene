A movie that would make one laugh, in suspense, excited, and even touched. A film that takes two personalities which clash, and learn to get along with each other, to where they actually care for one another in the end.  A film that touches one's soul, is a film that one can consider to be their favorite of all time.      Robert De Niro plays Jack Walsh, a ex-Chicago police officer who is currently a bounty hunter.  He works in Los Angeles for Eddie Moscone (Joe Pantoliano) who is a bail bonds man.  Eddie offers Jack a job to catch and bring back the infamous Jonathan the Duke Markukas (Charles Grodin).  Jonathan is a accountant who stole millions of Jimmy Serrano's (Dennis Farina) money, and gave it all to charity.  Jonathan jumped bail and is in hiding.  Jack needs to find John, bring him to the L.A. county jail within four days, and Jack will collect 100 thousand dollars.  Jack does find John, in New York City, the first day.  But Jack has many people following him.  First there's the FBI, led by Alonzo Mosely (Yaphet Kotto) who wants John to testify against Jimmy Serrano.  Second there's Tony Darvo (Richard Foronjy) and Robert Miranda (Joey), two dim-wits working for Serrano, who want John dead.  Then there is Marvin Dofler (John Ashton), another bounty hunter who wants John also, but for a smaller price.     From there on, it's a cross country trip which involve all of the men looking for Jack and John.  A film which has some very exciting moments with action.  Other moments where the scenes are intense where Jack and John's lives are in danger. And scenes where the two men share each other's thoughts and feelings, which surprisingly makes the movie touching.      The acting by De Niro is at his best.  He does his usual tough guy attitude, but he also mixes it with some humor, and emotions.  Charles Grodin is also great as the sensitive accountant who is the exact opposite of Jack's personality.   And Dennis Farina is funny and scary as the outraged mob boss who has a vicious attitude.      The music by Danny Elfman, I find to be his career best. It's not like his famous BATMAN, BETTLEJUICE, or SLEEPY HOLLOW style of score.  It's more like a mixture classic Chicago rhythm and blues, which even Elfman himself considered to be his most unusual score.        The writing by George Gallo is also excellent.  He manages to fit a cross country story within two hours of time, while still bringing out personalities of the characters and making sure there are no holes in the plot.  He also manages to have some very funny scenes involving Jack and John.      And the direction by Martin Brest is outstanding.  He keeps the movie at a very fast pace, without any slowing down.  He does brilliant moves like having De Niro and Grodin improvising their lines while arguing.  Brest also does a great job by making the film enjoyable for it's 125 minutes.      This is a movie that touched me, it can be considered a man's movie on the surface.  But take apart this film, and it's also a film that women can enjoy also.  The most emotional scenes involve Jack seeing his ex-wife and daughter after not seeing them for ten years.

The visuals are unlike any movie, the Wachowski brothers have created a roller coaster ride with only a few stops (although those stops are just as beautiful as the rest of the movie - I especially liked the sensitive display of Neo's healing process after he had woken to the real world). The premise of the movie - that the world might be nothing more than an illusion fed to our heads - is a bit of a science fiction cliché, but it can still be used to make an excellent sci-fi film (and most of the time The Matrix does just that). The acting is good, even Keanu Reeves manages to be credible, by acting as little as possible. Carrie-Anne Moss is also good, though her screen time could have been longer. The one who really steals the show, though, is Laurence Fishburne. His portrayal of Morpheus is excellent, I especially like the little touches that separate his Matrix persona from the Morpheus of the real world. To sum it up technically speaking The Matrix is nearly perfect.So, the set is excellent, the actors are good, and the speed is breathtaking - what is there to complain about? The problem, as in so many other big budget science fiction movies, is the ending. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the last third as well, but only on a physical level, not intellectually. The shoot-out in the lobby is one of the greatest action scenes cinema has ever produced, but that's all it is - a great action scene. The deeper elements of the plot (such as the agony agent Smith feels having to live in a world populated by humans) are left unexplored when the rumble begins. Scenes like Keanu Reeves yelling My name is NEO!, or Carrie-Anne Moss reviving Neo with a kiss make my cliché-o-meter bounce up to ten. And why, oh why does a film with such potential have to end in a kung-fu fight? Having already seen Bound, the Wachowski brothers' previous film, I had high expectations for The Matrix, but in the end it was clear that the low-budget Bound would still remain the better one of these two. Big money doesn't always equal conventionality, but in this case, sadly, it does.Let's just hope that the success of The Matrix gives the Wachowski brothers the courage to make movies which are satisfying both visually AND intellectually. They certainly are capable of doing so.

They certainly are capable of doing so.

The writing was clunky at best, offensive at worst.

Just try to ignore the blatant cynicism behind it all. If you want a titillating story of 18th-century sexual intrigue, I suggest you read Les Liaisons Dangereuses.

I really think this is one of the most underrated Disney movies out there.This version of Robin Hood has animals in the roles of the characters, and it works marvelously!  It would be natural for Robin Hood to be a fox if he was an animal, for both the fox and Robin are very clever.  And if Robin Hood is a fox, naturally, Maid Marian would be a vixen.  Also, having Prince John and King Richard as lions are natural choices, since the lion is the King of the Jungle.What I loved most about the film, as I hinted at earlier, is the humor, most of it provided by Prince John, Sir Hiss (a snake), Trigger, and Nutsy (both vultures).  Prince John's habit of sucking his thumb whenever anyone mentions his mother is priceless!  And he's so vain it's little trouble for Robin Hood and Little John (a bear) to rob him when they're disguised as fortune-tellers!

I found the film to be very different from the novel- less about Patrick Bateman's almost gleeful spree of sex and murder in high society, and more about a rich man watching his life dissolve as he comes to realize how empty everything and everyone in his world is. I found Christian Bale's portrayal of Bateman to be almost as I visualized from the book- handsome, spoiled, wealthy, but with a certain coldness and vacuousness that allows him to take lives without thought. I see now why Harron insisted (even to the point of almost quitting the film) that Bale play Bateman- he was perfect for the role. I am not among those who thought Bateman was imagining the killings (the book makes them too real), and, for me, the lack of violence in the film, or rather, the boiling down of the murders largely into one montage sequence, really detracted from the shock that the book carried with it. In addition, for a film that was supposed to give something of a feminist treatment of Ellis' novel, I found the female characters, especially Reese Witherspoon's Evelyn, to be sadly underwritten and under-developed. Evelyn is reduced to a whiney sideshow in the film; her relationship with Patrick was much more central to establishing the emptiness of the characters in the book, and leaving her out of all but 2-3 scenes in the film was a major mistake. Instead, Jean, Bateman's secretary, a minor character in the novel, is given much more screen time. I didn't see what the issue was over the censored sex scene- anything that was cut wasn't obvious, and you still get the feeling of Bateman's utter self-absorption. The cultural references (especially a particularly humorous monologue on Huey Lewis & the News) made for a good showcasing of the characters' fascination with trendiness, money, and power, while still showing how culturally empty the majority of the characters here are.

A few friends originally planned to come along, but they all gave me a rain check about an hour before we went to the cinema. Anyway, I hated the movie. I liked the first one, although it was (after Scream) too much like the 80´s slasher flicks. It had a nice atmosphere and all.The sequel stunk. It was like a generic 80´s slasher movie, no suspense, no nothing. Each kill happened formula-vise here´s a one minute scare scene where the victim looks around confused, then the fisherman shows up, the victim is petrified and just stands there (without doing something intelligent like running away The best example is the dock hand He hangs there and looks up at the fisherman striking him with the hook. Gee, he couldn´t have let himself drop back into the water...). Oh, and I hated it how easily the guys died in this movie. It´s not even baseball Just one strike and you´re out. Come on, compare it to Scream, people are really GUTTED there before they were finally dead. It may be gory, but at least it´s realistic. I mean, I don´t want gore-fests, I don´t even have to see the blood, but I want to know it´s there. There was a scene were I thought What the... how could she die from THAT???. I´m talking about the fisherman throwing Brandy into the shelf. Okay, now she is alive in the end, but come on.

This movie didn't really turn me into a super duper star wars fan. But I sure must                               admit that ''Star Wars'', ''The Empire Strikes Back'', and ''Return Of The Jedi'' (                               or in another way the ''Star Wars Trilogy'' ) is by far the greatest movie(s) ever                               created. George Lucas rocks! The actors where good, the effects was ( in the                               70s ) incredible, and the directing very good. It's an adventure beyond everything                               else. And the other 2 movies were at least as perfect.                               In the ''first'' Star Wars-movie princess Leia is captured by the evil Space                               Empire, lead by the even more evil Darth Vader, from their gigantic space station,                               The Death Star. The rescuers are Luke Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Han Solo,                               C-3PO, R2-D2 and Chewie, but let's not bore you. We all know that.                              The best thing about this movie is that it combines so many kinds of genres. Star                               Wars is filled with action, adventure and absolutly fantastic space scenes. But in                               the same time the movie is human, sad and the romance is not as flat as in all the                               80's action movies. The movie is also a saga. The farmerboy finds the eremite,                               they take help from the raw cowboy and his sidekicks, and the mission is to                               rescue a princess. That message was strongest in Episode IV.                               It is a classic battle between good and evil. And not in a Evil Dead-way nor in a                               Exorcist-way. It is the Star Wars-way. The best example of the longtime battle.                               Once again, I can't say that I'm a Star Wars-freak, but this is the greatest movie.

But I sure must                               admit that ''Star Wars'', ''The Empire Strikes Back'', and ''Return Of The Jedi'' (                               or in another way the ''Star Wars Trilogy'' ) is by far the greatest movie(s) ever                               created. George Lucas rocks! The actors where good, the effects was ( in the                               70s ) incredible, and the directing very good. It's an adventure beyond everything                               else. And the other 2 movies were at least as perfect.                               In the ''first'' Star Wars-movie princess Leia is captured by the evil Space                               Empire, lead by the even more evil Darth Vader, from their gigantic space station,                               The Death Star. The rescuers are Luke Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Han Solo,                               C-3PO, R2-D2 and Chewie, but let's not bore you. We all know that.                              The best thing about this movie is that it combines so many kinds of genres. Star                               Wars is filled with action, adventure and absolutly fantastic space scenes. But in                               the same time the movie is human, sad and the romance is not as flat as in all the                               80's action movies. The movie is also a saga. The farmerboy finds the eremite,                               they take help from the raw cowboy and his sidekicks, and the mission is to                               rescue a princess. That message was strongest in Episode IV.                               It is a classic battle between good and evil. And not in a Evil Dead-way nor in a                               Exorcist-way. It is the Star Wars-way. The best example of the longtime battle.                               Once again, I can't say that I'm a Star Wars-freak, but this is the greatest movie.
