It was so wonderful in taking its time and having great character moments all throughout the film...and that's important...they're not just used to establish characters at the beginning...they are used to show the emotional journey as the film progresses...and not just Frodo, the main character, but all the characters are developed...each is on his own emotional journey...you care about them all, you have hopes and fears as to where their paths will lead them, and you can't wait to continue on.

Yeah, orcs and wizards rule, we all know that, and we could all watch a badass elven archer sniping trick shots into things' eyes all day, but how engaging a story is boils down to whether or not you care about the characters and what happens to them...and in this film...you do...and these genuine emotional connections combined with the fantasy world of Middle Earth...it brings you back to the magic of childhood...the sense of wonder and fasciantion...the raw emotion...it gives you back your innocence and takes it away again...it is moving and it is brilliant.These wonderful characters need a world to exist in and a lot has been written about how detailed and realistic the world of Middle Earth has been depicted in the film.  While, yes, it does have that quality of history...like all this did physically exist...but the aspect of the world that stands out as another incredible achievement is a conveyed sense of wholeness and what I mean by that is a sense that these are characters in a world...sounds simple, like, every character is a character in a world right?  But no, that's not true.  So many movies present stories that have the sense that they're being played out in a vacuum...that all that exists in the world is wherever the characters go.  In Fellowship of the Ring, you get the sense that there is a complete world going on apart from the main characters and that these particular characters are just tiny individuals in that world.  The creation of this wholeness on the part of the filmmakers serves two purposes...first, it is essential in creating the sense of danger, the idea that the world is creeping in on these characters' lives and we watch and see how they deal with it...and second, it evokes a spirit of exploration in you as a viewer, like, you want to go out and discover the wonders of Middle Earth for yourself and so you can't wait to see where the characters will go to next...and you especially can't wait to see where they will go to in The Two Towers as Fellowship of the Ring ends...you know it's made and you can't wait a year to see it...it's a blissful madness to be sure.There is really too much to praise about this film to put in a brief review but what I've written about above...the sincere connection to the emotional journeys of the characters and the sense of wholeness that the world of Middle Earth is given...these are, for me, what make this film, and consequently the entire trilogy, something very special.

Also I found that it did not satisfy my desire for an ending to the story. However that may be a part of what the film is meant to be.Unlike most I loved the ape sequence all apart from the monolith.  Never was it explained how it got there or why or even what impact it had, I thought when I saw it that it would empower the chimps somehow but then it seemed they evolved themselves.The cut from bone to space ship was daring at the time, not particuarly well done but it does provoke thought.  The musical sequence from there is what the movie is known for and is good to watch once although i'm not sure about more than that.  It must be remembered that at the time it would have facinated viewers with ideas they had never seen before and that is how it should be judged.The story starts off well, setting up a plot of finding a monolith and sending an investigation crew to Jupiter.  This is where it feels like I started watching a different movie, one inside of the main movie.  The idea of HAL and him going mad was well done but not explained at all in 2001 (more on that later).  Apart from HAL none of the charachters were personable enough to gain any empathy with them, which detracts a little from me and the movie tends to plod along from there.Then bowman finds the larger monolith and the movie turns.  The stargate sequence (not sure what to call it) is visually stunning even by todays standards and the realisation half way through of a birth is good even though I had a clue from the DVD chapter title.  It did however last too long for my liking and I didnt like the changing ages much at all.Then the movie ends, I feel a little empty, stunned by those effects being from '68 and not '98 but empty.  I didn't understand.Until I bought 2010 which despite not being directed by Kubrick is the actual sequal.  It explains HAL's madness, it uses the changing ages of bowman and expands on the Birth and full of stars idea and has  a nice message at the end, especiually in the middle of the cold war.Really Kubrick used the book as a template to try something different, some of it worked, some didnt, the story was nearly forgotten in the artistic element.As a stand alone movie in the current day it is OK, not good, not bad and very confusing.

Jean Roberts (Delores Taylor), sort of Billy's love interest, runs the Freedom School.  She is the passionate figure of the movie, but certainly only platonically.One curiousity is what the director is trying to do with the character of Sheriff Cole, a compromising personality, but who overall seems to be presented favorably.  A good man rather than bad like the rest of the town, he is unable and unwilling to mount an effective resistance to the bad guys tho he serves as a go-between, helps Billy and the Freedom Schoolers behind the scenes, and yes, once, rescues Billy, by, sort of, standing up against the beaters.  Like Billy, he is totally outnumbered by pretty much an entirely bad white community, like the prosecutor in the Mississippi civil rights murder cases trying to convince the jury.

They just don't get it.It really p***es me off when people trash an ambitious, thought-provoking movie like Vanilla Sky.  They do it because it makes them feel important. Anyone can trash Tomcats, right?  But if you can bash Cameron Crowe, you must be REALLY smart.People put out this bad buzz, and then the ambitious movies don't make as much money, and then we end up with theaters full of Scary Movie III and Dude Where's My Car.  Oh joy.To the people who call this movie unfocused  Look, you cretins.  This is an ambitious film.  It blurs the traditional lines between fantasy and reality, it leaves you hanging in limbo for much longer than you're used to. Most movies tell you exactly what to think.  Vanilla Sky leaves you guessing.  Calling this movie unfocused is another way of saying I need to be spoon fed the plot!  I'm a cinematic toddler!  Go watch Legally Blonde and talk about how cute Reese is in her argyle sweater and leave this movie alone.To those who said Vanilla Sky is full of bad acting  Excuse me?  I'm sorry, but it is an absolute travesty that Cuba Gooding, Jr., Anna Paquin, Jack Palance and Marisa Tomei have acting Oscars, and Tom Cruise doesn't.  He's a great talent, no question.  He takes chances.  He plays strange, even unlikeable roles, and he's not afraid.  We need to give him his Oscar, because there's a bit of desperation creeping in to his recent work--as if he's doing acting backflips to get respect.  Penelope Cruz is gorgeous and likeable.  Cameron Diaz could get by on just being HOT.  But she doesn't. She takes roles in Being John Malkovich, and Vanilla Sky, and she even elevated her character in Best Friend's Wedding.  Brava, Cammie.To those who say the movie is too long  I'm sorry, but when Pearl Harbor comes in at 3 hours, I think I can forgive Vanilla Sky for being 135 minutes (not 150, as a million reviewers have incorrectly stated).  As if all of you geniuses who have time to write reviews on IMDB can't spare an extra 15 minutes.To those who say it's not as good as Almost Famous  Whatever.

Oh joy.To the people who call this movie unfocused  Look, you cretins.  This is an ambitious film.  It blurs the traditional lines between fantasy and reality, it leaves you hanging in limbo for much longer than you're used to. Most movies tell you exactly what to think.  Vanilla Sky leaves you guessing.  Calling this movie unfocused is another way of saying I need to be spoon fed the plot!  I'm a cinematic toddler!  Go watch Legally Blonde and talk about how cute Reese is in her argyle sweater and leave this movie alone.To those who said Vanilla Sky is full of bad acting  Excuse me?  I'm sorry, but it is an absolute travesty that Cuba Gooding, Jr., Anna Paquin, Jack Palance and Marisa Tomei have acting Oscars, and Tom Cruise doesn't.  He's a great talent, no question.  He takes chances.  He plays strange, even unlikeable roles, and he's not afraid.  We need to give him his Oscar, because there's a bit of desperation creeping in to his recent work--as if he's doing acting backflips to get respect.  Penelope Cruz is gorgeous and likeable.  Cameron Diaz could get by on just being HOT.  But she doesn't. She takes roles in Being John Malkovich, and Vanilla Sky, and she even elevated her character in Best Friend's Wedding.  Brava, Cammie.To those who say the movie is too long  I'm sorry, but when Pearl Harbor comes in at 3 hours, I think I can forgive Vanilla Sky for being 135 minutes (not 150, as a million reviewers have incorrectly stated).

He should stick to this kind of thing.  There is, as everyone has noticed, a distinct shortage of good character actors.

It was made in '71, and yeah it really, really looks it-but ya gotta like it. William Windom as da Prez is pretty cool too, def. a knockoff of hostile Nixon in places I would say.This sets up the next two fine, though its both better than them and better than #2 in the run also. I think you can do worse than to sit through this.......**1\/2 outta ****   ","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"15 December 2001","score":"12 out of 14 people found the following review useful","review":"  You have Ricardo Montalbon, you have Soap star Eric 'mustache' Breaden, and you have Sal 'Rebel without a Cause' Mineo.

A walk through the snow, a father to son chat, or a freckle...Vanilla Sky is a great, psychological thriller. If you walk out on the movie and say it was stupid because it was too far fetched, you are missing the concept. How many new ideas are out there today in movies.

It's not that it was godawful, but having read the book, I knew how it all worked out-- and I had no confidence left that there would be anything the least bit interesting about how Rowling's story would be illustrated.That's what it is; the book faithfully, and dully, illustrated, line by line.  It's so faithful to the order of incidents (and the need to keep the story moving) that it has no time to give us any of the characterization that made us root for Harry; at best we get instantly recognizable movie stereotypes (Draco Malfoy has a Richie Rich 'do, therefore he must be from the same snotty rich kids' fraternity as Greg Marmalard).  Seemingly ideal casting-- Alan Rickman as Snape, say-- is wasted when the characters turn out only to have half a dozen lines in the entire movie, most of them expository.  Maggie Smith, Ian Hart, Richard Griffiths, Fiona Shaw, all wasted; the peerless John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick has, as memory serves, all of two lines-- one to explain why he's nearly headless, and one to announce, in Boys' Own Weekly cliches, that the Quidditch Cup is sure going to be hotly contested this year.  Maybe only Robbie Coltrane and John Hurt get enough dialogue to begin to sketch a character.The other problem-- not unrelated, surely-- is that Chris Columbus is, for the millionth time, the wrong wrong wrong director for the job.  He has no sense of magic, of mystery, of English eccentricity.  Give him two wizards skulking about a suburban tract house, and he'll make them seem as ordinary as two retirees strolling and chatting about the weather.  Give him an evil spirit sucking the blood of a dead unicorn and being interrupted by a centaur, and he makes it seem like two retirees strolling and chatting about the weather.  Give him a chess game, and he makes it seem like World War III.  Give him Gringott's bank, and he ignores the baroque set that's been built and can't wait to show us a big pile of gold, which is surely a bit revealing.  This isn't as awful a blockbuster as, say, Tomb Raider, but it comes from the same land of impoverished imagination camouflaged with booming, expensive yet somehow cheap-looking special effects.
