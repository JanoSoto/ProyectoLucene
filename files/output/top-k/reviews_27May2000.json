But the rest sucked!  Warning spoilers throughout so be wary if you haven't seen the movie!Okay, all the slow motion stuff was bad.  I mean its cool if you use it now and then for the really cool stuff, but not ALL THE TIME!  Like in the begining when he jumps from the cliff, that was cool.  But I dont need to see it in slow motion evertime he does a little flip that's not really even that complicated.  I swear, virtually every stunt he did was in slow mo, and most of them weren't that complicated, we don't need to see everything slowed down just to see Cruises hair fly all over the place.Story  Story not that good, love story didn't even develop, there might be a lot of missing footage from that.  Bad guy not that bad, rather flat actually.  I was actually bored for at least 45 minutes while the story developed which it really didn't.Action  Now since this was John Woo I thought the action scenes would be great, but they weren't.  They sucked.  The motorcycle chase has its moments of coolness, but also its moments of obsurdity.  Like when Cruise and the villain jump off their bikes and hit each other and fall off the cliff, how dumb was that.  People were laughing because that belongs in a cartoon. And why, in the biotech building, when he was supposed to be hurrying, why was Cruise slowly walking everywhere?  And it wasn't slow motion, he was just walking dramatically slow, and right before he can destroy the last of the virus he pauses for like thirty seconds thinking.  That was sooooooo dumb. The mask thing was cool at first, but they did it so often at first that it got confusing, I really think there was a lot of cuts made to this movie, cause things didn't seem right.  The last time they did the mask switching was cool, that was the moment of genious in the film, but every other time they did it it was dumb. It was okay, worth watching on video definently, but not really spending ten bucks to go see it in the theators.
