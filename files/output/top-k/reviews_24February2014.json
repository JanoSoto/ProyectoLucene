Debuting on April 6, 2001 in theaters, it was sure to be a fan favorite, with aspiring dreams of reaching the heights of movies alike like the Godfather. With a star studded cast headlined by Johnny Deep (George Jung) and Penelope Cruz (Mirtha Jung) and backed by solid actors such as; Franka Potente, Jordi Molla and Cliff Curtis, anticipation was high for the release. Out of the $30 million starting budget, $12.5 million was made back just in opening weekend. Speaking to the strenghth of the movie as a whole, the film went on to gross $53 million as of July 2001. (Blow) Surprisingly, to me at least, the movie did not go on to win any prestigious awards, which could be in part do to the smaller budget of the film. The director, Ted Demme did go on to get nominated for a Crystal Globe by the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, along with another personal nomination of Penelope Cruz for Breakthrough Female Performance by the MTV Movie Awards. The only win the movie was able to capture was a Prism award presented by the Prism Awards for Theatrical Feature Film. Graeme Revell was nominated for Best Original Score of the Year Not Released on an Album for his role in Blow. (Blow) Just a little background on George Jung, he was born in 1942 in a small suburb outside Boston, Massachusetts. One he got to high school\/college age, he began to experiment with marijuana, both smoking and selling also to make small profits. This is where the movie starts, George and his childhood friend Tuna decide to leave their small town in the East and see what California has to offer them. California has all they can ask for; drugs, women, beautiful beaches, and most importantly a market for them to sell their weed that they obtain from flamboyant hairdresser Derek, who they met through George's lady Barbara, who also is a stewardess. George naturally, always looking for something better soon realizes after a visit with a friend from back East that the market for weed back in his childhood state is exponentially higher than in California and with that could come exponential profits. Gears get moving and before you know it, Barbara's suitcases are packed tight with pounds upon pounds of marijuana headed back East almost daily. More, More, More is all that George hears in his mind and Derek is simply not able to deliver. George is no longer playing a game of small risk, small reward, he has elevated himself to a new level with new risks. 1972, games it is no longer, the police bust him with 620 pounds of marijuana crossing through Chicago. Followed by 2 years in prison, George Jung exclaims I went in with a bachelor's of marijuana and came out with a doctorate in cocaine. (Roger, Ebert) Mid 1970s, can be looked at and world wide power Pablo Escobar can be seen. Who was this man? Pablo Escobar was one of the most powerful men of this decade because of a thin white powder called cocaine. Here, in Medellin, Colombia, George Jung is introduced to the Colombian cartel led by Pablo Escobar. A budding mutually profitable relationship forms between Escobar, who needs a runner and seller in America and Jung, who needs a source and a supply of this new drug running rampant through the country. Jung is now blinded by the light of success and power and money, with the cartel at his back he says that he now feels invincible. At this point in his life he meets beautiful but wild Mirtha (Penelope Cruz), who he soon marries. This part in the movie would be considered the climax, because from here on out it goes downhill, whether it is because he is not thinking as clearly or if it is simply just a matter of business. George tells his partner Diego who his middle man is that is helping him deliver and distribute the cocaine. With this newfound information, Diego goes right to Derek, the middle man, and undercuts George right out of the business that he started from the ground up. At this point, George leaves the cocaine business, but not without harsh consequences. In a spiraling turmoil he loses all his money, his freedom through one last DEA bust, and even his family whilst he is in jail, all in quick succession. Ending with a beaten and demoralized and completely broken picture of the real George Jung. This is a story of the damaging effects that such rapid success can have on a human being. George Jung started his life on top of the world but quickly fell to his knees losing everything he had by getting blinded by the light of success he was having.

Quite funny and give's off some good laughs for you, but also provides a fairly good spy film as well just like a James Bond but with much funnier humour than even Roger Moore. I'll tell below why I think it is a good film.The story is solid and as I said a good spy film and with Dr Evil being one of the most famous and most funny villains in film, you can't help just feel good whilst watching it. The film has a slow start but get's into it quick enough and Powers is humorous throughout but it really is Dr Evil who steals the humour off him in this first instalment. Finally on the story it is actually a good Sci-Fi too which blends in well with the comedy and crime and also makes for some crazy sequences.I do like Mike Myers in this film but I felt he failed slightly at playing Austin Powers as his other portrayal of Dr Evil is much funnier and basically rules he comedy in this piece. Liz Hurley is a good performance as Power's agent helper and she guides the more serious side of agents which is then lampooned by Austin. Finally One great comedy part of this is with Dr Evil's table of evil people, and his son Scott who is just brilliant(Seth Green portraying) and the only person who isn't frightened of Dr Evil and constantly complains about little things.I think the set's and gadgets etc used are great because they optimise what James Bond uses but completely humour's them and makes for some funny joke set up's. It is well written comedy wise by Mike Myers who serve's as the main actor, producer and writer and he put's together a film that he truly owns, it also makes you want to see what he could write for the next instalments and that would test his skill that is seen in this film.The film can be unfunny and not that I think everyone will hate the jokes but some jokes just miss the mark and become just to crude, slightly less crude and this film could have been massively better but it is still a good comedy all around. I think also that the story is obviously not the strongest ever but what do you expect with a comedy, and don't think this film isn't funny because people say it isn't, just watch it first.I recommend it for anyone who enjoys a good and crude comedy that can be tasteless at times but manages enough class to be funny but also sophisticated in it's jokes. If you don't enjoy a lot of sexual humour then this isn't for you as Powers is a sex addicted man from the 60's who tries it on with any female he see's it seems but though it isn't serious perverseness he is obviously making himself look stupid to make you laugh.Overall a just about good film, it only just scrapes out being good rather than just fairly good but I think many will agree with me, although some will be disappointed with this film as well so I expect mixed reviews from most who see it. Worth a watch and if you watch it purely for the comedy you can enjoy yourself, just don't open your mind too much or you may not enjoy it as much.

As far as understanding the movie, there is little to worry about understanding the plot. There is very little information given to outline the plot, and very little plot. It's pretty simple, he is crazy. That doesn't mean he is not also brilliant, but assuredly he is a nut job. This matters little in the end as the story is fleeting and pointless. Now for the acting. The lead actor is one of the worst actors I have ever seen. His portrayal is labored and not believable. I can actually feel as though I can see Aronofsky off to the side saying OK now get a bit more frantic, and break that computer there! Now look kinda scared and confused... Ben Shenkman is actually redeemable and somewhat interesting, and Mark Margolis is a terrific actor and is the one actor who shines through. This is not nearly enough to make the film even remotely enjoyable. The woman and her goons that accost him randomly throughout the movie are some of the worst over the top actors I have ever seen, as is the little Asian girl. I don't enjoy bad mouthing a child actor (though she is a grown up by now at any rate) she was just so bad it's atrocious. Friends of mine (with whom I usually agree with when it comes to taste in movies) say this is the early version of requiem for a dream, supposedly requiem being the Hollywood money version.

Requiem is an amazing film, fantastic direction, acting, script, style etc. It is a strong film that shines a light on drug addiction, the pressure of adult life, actions, reactions and consequences. Pi is nothing like this, not even one tiny bit. It is a horrible mess of video and audio, it really does not deserve to be called a movie as it would signify that it has some kind of story and\/or cohesion, which it absolutely lacks in every way. To be clear, I am not a hater of independent films or artistic films. I loathe Michael Bay and his ilk of directors. The fact is that good film making is just that, whether it is a low budget gem or a high budget Hollywood gold mine. I have no problem with black and white films either. That being said, filming low budget b\/w film doesn't automatically make it deep and rich in texture. Much as you can't put $200,000,000 into a film and guarantee a blockbuster smash hit that gets great reviews, you can't shoot low budget and expect to make a great film based on almost no story and terrible acting.

Poor direction, terrible acting, lousy choices in set design... I could go on an on but I wont waste too much time, I wasted enough on this stupid film. While I'm not a mathematician or numerologist I am a smart man who has seen and studied many movies and styles of movies. As far as understanding the movie, there is little to worry about understanding the plot. There is very little information given to outline the plot, and very little plot. It's pretty simple, he is crazy. That doesn't mean he is not also brilliant, but assuredly he is a nut job. This matters little in the end as the story is fleeting and pointless. Now for the acting. The lead actor is one of the worst actors I have ever seen. His portrayal is labored and not believable. I can actually feel as though I can see Aronofsky off to the side saying OK now get a bit more frantic, and break that computer there! Now look kinda scared and confused... Ben Shenkman is actually redeemable and somewhat interesting, and Mark Margolis is a terrific actor and is the one actor who shines through. This is not nearly enough to make the film even remotely enjoyable. The woman and her goons that accost him randomly throughout the movie are some of the worst over the top actors I have ever seen, as is the little Asian girl. I don't enjoy bad mouthing a child actor (though she is a grown up by now at any rate) she was just so bad it's atrocious. Friends of mine (with whom I usually agree with when it comes to taste in movies) say this is the early version of requiem for a dream, supposedly requiem being the Hollywood money version. I must say I do not see this at all. Requiem is an amazing film, fantastic direction, acting, script, style etc. It is a strong film that shines a light on drug addiction, the pressure of adult life, actions, reactions and consequences. Pi is nothing like this, not even one tiny bit. It is a horrible mess of video and audio, it really does not deserve to be called a movie as it would signify that it has some kind of story and\/or cohesion, which it absolutely lacks in every way.

I felt the movie was bad, but couldn't say why exactly. It's hard to find fault in a movie with such an esteemed cast, such great sets and cinematography, etc. I knew it was based on a famous novel, so I figured the problem must have been in the adaptation.Upon reading the novel and then going back to the film, I realized something interesting the film starts out as a faithful adaptation before losing its way, but the biggest issue is the tone.The novel's style of magical realism is, right from the start, difficult to adapt to film. There's green hair, there's magic remedies, and there's a very darkly humorous tone. The film on the other hand is very bleak and brooding, with only some slight supernatural element, which is kind of shrugged off. Roger Ebert, who always has a perfect way of articulating the best criticism, worded it best Magic realism, which informs so many South American stories, is treated here as a slightly embarrassing social gaffe, like passing wind. Clara's gifts are not made integral to the story; the filmmakers see them more as ornamentation. For example, in the book, Severo and Nivea die in a car accident and Clara keeps her mother's decapitated head in the basement. Years later, when Clara dies, Esteban tells his servants Well, we might as well bury my mother-in-law's head now. Moments like that are missing, and instead we just have a scene of Severo and Nivea in a random car accident in the film, and are then never mentioned again. Why even bother having the car accident at all? And why waste Vanessa Redgrave in such a small role? Now this leads into another issue the most infamous criticism of this film is that it stars a bunch of gringos (Jeremy Irons, Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, and Winona Ryder) as Chilean characters. At first glance, you might think this is a shallow thing to criticize actors play characters of different ethnic backgrounds all the time, nor is there any one way that a Chilean person should look. But I think this criticism is actually a misdiagnosis of a bigger problem. The problem isn't that these actors are all Anglo; it's the fact that they play their characters in a very Anglicized way for an Anglo audience. They mispronounce names like Tres Marias (Trays Muh-ree-ahs) and Esteban (Estuh-baan) and say them all as if these names are foreign to them. Irons, who is British, sounds American while Close, who is American, sounds British. Winona Ryder's character is presented as an all-American girl. There's even a scene towards the end, while Blanca is being tortured and Alba waits for her at home, where Alba is eating out a Kentucky Fried Chicken box in the 1970's! (KFC didn't start opening stores in Chile until 1992. Yes, I actually looked it up out of curiosity). Now you might say Who cares if they show a KFC box? That's nitpicking. It might not seem important, but on a subtextual level, it's significant. The filmmakers are trying to dilute the Hispanism of the story and create the mindset that this could easily be happening in the US. All of this adds a feeling of displacement to the movie. Because it loses its Chilean and Latino identity, the politics lose their context. What is the coup at the end all about? Why does it happen? What happened to the workers at Tres Marias? Why was Pedro III an enemy of the military's?When you take this story, remove its Hispanic context and magic realism, what you're left with is just a domestic drama, which is less interesting than its book counterpart when it is simplified. The adaptation's biggest change is the removal of an entire generation and combining Blanca and Alba into one character. This completely changes the third act and it now makes no sense for Esteban to help Pedro III escape. In the book, Esteban joins forces with Miguel as they both care about saving Alba. In the film's version, joining forces with Pedro III will in no way have any affect on saving Blanca. The impact of Esteban's relationship with Alba is also lost as she is reduced to only a small child in the film and not given much character. In the book, Esteban has affairs with multiple women at Tres Marias and fathers many children, which everyone is aware of. In the film, he just randomly commits violent rape one day in a very abrupt scene, and then completely forgets about it until a son shows up one day. Because of the removal of an entire generation, Esteban III in the book is Esteban II in the film, and his character is given the Hollywood archetypes of a perverse and disturbed villain rather than as the symbol of lineage of violence he was in the book. In addition to this you have the removal of Blanca's brothers from the book and a climax that doesn't play very dramatically, and the resulting story is very fractured and loses the epic 3-generation sweep of the novel.I am left wondering if any film could have been made of this book, which has so many characters and spans many different episodes. Regardless, this film, and its serious tone, do not suit the book at all, and just leaves audiences wondering what the story they just saw was all about.

An array of recurring patterns and themes throughout the movie present a viewer with the honest truth about drug addiction and a number of the horrors that accompany such a lifestyle. Though drug addicts are often looked down upon in society, and many will agree that they should be, Boyle's film represents a sincere and almost sympathetic point of view regarding the path down which many individuals travel in the pursuit of an unhealthy but ever powerful drug addiction. Despite the fact that the movie contains a number of disturbing scenes and scenarios, they are an attempt to force a viewer to face the reality that drug addiction is a sickness of its own that holds many captive against their will. Ultimately, it is through the use of interesting character development and subtle symbolism that the 1996 film Trainspotting presents a disturbing, yet brutally honest depiction of the horrors of drug addiction and the consequences that result from choosing such a path in life.The first, and perhaps most terrifying message illustrated within the film is the idea that despite all that may result from living this particular lifestyle, a drug addict never seems to have enough. Trainspotting (Boyle 1996) highlights the lengths to which addicts will travel in order to feed the monster inside of them that is a powerful addiction. The opening scene, along with many others in the film, displays the characters robbing, fighting, and running from the police simply in an effort to pursue their next hit. One scene that caught my particular attention regarding this message is when we see Mark Renton sneaking into his parents' bedroom to steal money from under their mattress. The idea presented here is that a drug addict and a normal human being are simply incomparable in terms of moral values. Once the addiction has grown to the point that is highlighted in the film, all moral values become inexistent, and as Renton describes in his narration of the film Who needs reasons when you've got heroin? (Trainspotting 1996). This idea is the driving force behind the actions illustrated within the film, and leads to the infinitely long downward spiral that is a drug addiction. The movie also utilizes a number of symbolic scenes to highlight the fact that an addict is always chasing their last hit. After Renton procures the suppository pills that, at the time of the scene are his alleged last dose, they fall into the disgustingly dirty toilet presented in the beginning of the movie. The following scene, in which Renton climbs into the toilet to find them, is a hallucination that is very significant to this idea. As he swims through the water in this strange hallucination, the idea presented is that Renton is chasing his last hit before he will quit for good; a process that we later find out never ends for most. Although his plan to stop using for good fails, this strange scene depicts this idea perfectly. Steven Rea writes in the Philadelphia Inquirer that Brian Tufano's agile cinematography captures the stoned-out, gut-churning experience of hardcore addiction with hallucinogenic acuity. which I find to be a perfect depiction of this message. Another important message that illustrates the terrors of such a horrible addiction is the theme that choosing heroin means not choosing life. Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune describes Trainspotting (Boyle 1996) as a guided tour of a specific hell in his review of the movie, which is certainly an accurate representation of the lives of the characters. The movie begins with Renton's satirical narration that encourages the audience to choose life (Trainspotting 1996), as he sarcastically mocks the commodities that accompany such a decision. However, as Renton explains towards the beginning of the movie, when he is not using heroin there is simply too much to worry about. The characters are presented with a startling revelation that they are in fact human with the death of Allison's baby, yet react in a very inhumane way. As Renton stands there observing the dead baby, he explains that he cannot think of anything human (Trainspotting 1996) to say in such a situation. Instead of offering sympathy or compassion, Renton simply utters I'm cooking up (Trainspotting 1996) and offers Allison a hit as well; a symbolic representation of the fact that heroin is the only outlet they have to deal with the many stresses of living a drug-free life. In my opinion, this is one of the most startling aspects of the life of addiction the fact that a combination of chemicals has the power to cover up the pain of life, and death in this situation. While many will argue that Trainspotting (Boyle 1996) is a groundbreaking film that will certainly be remembered as a classic, in my opinion it is simply a grotesquely honest representation of the lives of drug addicts. While Danny Boyle's character development and use of symbols throughout the movie effectively illustrate the horrors of drug addiction, Trainspotting does not do much else. As a whole, I would give Trainspotting (Boyle 1996) a rating of four out of five stars although I do not believe the individual aspects of the movie would receive such a high rating. Trainspotting (Boyle 1996) is certainly worth watching for those that are interested to learn more about the lives of drug addicts, but may not be as entertaining to those who are not.

As a whole, I would give Trainspotting (Boyle 1996) a rating of four out of five stars although I do not believe the individual aspects of the movie would receive such a high rating. Trainspotting (Boyle 1996) is certainly worth watching for those that are interested to learn more about the lives of drug addicts, but may not be as entertaining to those who are not.

An excellent movie with potential to rise higher and here is why I think so below.We'll start with the story which is well different to many other Drama's in the sense it nearly could have a little comedy genre under it's title as some parts can be quite hilarious. The film is also very serious as well and as you will see if you watch it, part's can be hard hitting and you see the hard effect drugs have on the addicts and the one's they love as well. I loved the ending I am sure you will too as out of the bleakness some parts can be happy and in a certain way philosophical too, with Ewan McGregor's character showing us his mind and what he thinks' about life and it's adventure's.Danny Boyle the director and future Oscar winner(he won for Slumdog Millionaire in 2009), does a great job here and make's the fine actors he has at his disposal even more dramatic and his artistic vision I think came off the way he wanted it too. The screenplay is fantastic and all thanks to John Hodge who is unknown in truth but this film wouldn't be what it is without it really. The film's set's are also fantastic and the heroin dens are superbly set out to make the film authentic and a strange city in Edinburgh which you really ever connect with drug addicts.McGregor is great in the main role and even his voice as the voice- over is fantastic too. The supporting cast are also fabulous with particular praise going to Robert Carlyle and his fairly insane character who seriously should not be angered. There isn't really a truly clear villain in this but you could say that in the end the drugs were the villain stopping the characters from living a truly normal life and whenever any of them try to give up, they get sucked back in again.If any bad come's from this film in a critical sense it is well, well, it is hard to find wrong's really but I guess at the beginning there is the humour part of it but from the middle till the end the film get's very serious. I won't write too much because it is hard to be critical, this isn't my favourite film of ALL time but nonetheless it is still hard to criticise.Recommend the film for those who like a film that is drug fuelled and that makes the world seem dark then bright and then back again to being bleak. I think many won't like the drug part because it has serious drug taking and a lot of swearing so not for those who don't appreciate 18 rated films but generally if not I think anyone who like any films can love this.Overall it was safely Great, it wasn't quite near being superb in my opinion but nonetheless pulls away from just being very good. It has potential to be much better but that is for you to work out, it is a film where you can sit and sit back well and just enjoy an excellent piece of Drama.

If so, then 10 Things I Hate About You did this. Gil Junger directs this 1999 Touchstone teen romance that follows the love adventures of 4 teens. The plot line is nothing too different from every other teen romance movie and is quite predictable. The actors, however, were charming, engaging, and lovable. Their wonderful portrayals brought the seemingly worn out plot line to life and left the audience feeling happy and filled with warm fuzzies. The dialogue and one-liners added humor and made the movie enjoyable for everyone watching. The story follows the classic chick flick plot line and doesn't stray too much. While it is quite predictable, viewers still find themselves drawn in and excited when things work out. The standout actors in this film are Joseph Gordon Levitt, Heath Ledger, and Julia Styles. Joseph Gordon Levitt portrays the adorable Cameron, the new kid who falls for the popular, beautiful Bianca (Larisa Oleynik). He is cute, sweet, pure hearted and very easy to love. Ledger and Styles, on the other hand, play the scary and misunderstood teens. Styles gracefully embodies her heinous bitch character but is immediately liked by the audience because of her sass and wit. The same goes for Ledgers character, Patrick. This fierce Australian boy is surrounded by mystery and rumors, which causes the students at Padua high to be very afraid of him. He plays the bad boy role well but in a way that leaves room for later in the movie when his character is seen as a respectful, kind guy. Andrew Keegan, who plays Joey, and Larisa Oleynik playing Bianca have much easier characters but also portray them well. Joey simply has to be the handsome, popular jerk and Bianca is the ditsy cute girl who eventually gives up her selfish ways. Its no surprise that this film racked up seven nominations for awards based on actors performances (IMDb). The actors were excellent, and it was obvious to everyone who saw the movie. Having such good actors, however, may have hurt the film. Viewers are forced to see the actors change their minds with almost no prompting. The plot does not address why Bianca suddenly changes her mind about Cameron, or why Patrick eventually falls for Kat. All that the viewer sees is that these teens now magically have feelings for people that they were originally using for their own selfish gain. As Robert Ebert said in his review Sometimes it's a mistake to have acting this charming; the characters become so engaging and spontaneous, we notice how they're trapped in the plot (Ebert). If you ignore the over used plot structure, however, you see a great movie. The story has a lot of heart and some great one-liners. The dialogue in the movie is fantastic with the sexual innuendo and sassy retorts. For example; in English class when Kat and Joey were arguing Joey asked the teacher Mr. Morgan, is there any chance we could get Kat to take her Midol *before* she comes to class? to which Mr. Morgan fired back Someday, you gonna get bitch-slapped and I'm not gonna do a thing to stop it. What makes this line even better is that it is foreshadowing because at the end of the movie Joey does get bitch-slapped and not a single person helps him after. Even the sisters' outrageous father is hilarious when he is telling them what not to do when they go to a party; No drinking, no drugs, no kissing, no tattoos, no ritual animal slaughtering's of any kind. Oh, God, I'm giving them ideas (10 Things 1999). While some of the lines are a bit wacky, they give the movie character and help it stand out from the thousands of other films in the genre. It is these moments that really make the viewers fall in love with the characters and become invested in the story. When a movie is quotable, people talk about it more, mention the quotes whenever possible and thus they want to watch the movie again to hear the funny lines. Overall, the movie, while being very predictable, has a lot of heart. The witty dialogue and the fantastic performances make 10 Things I Hate About You a memorable and enjoyable movie. I would give the movie a 4.5 out of 5 stars. Anyone can find something they like about this movie.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"24 February 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I've never met anyone like Forrest Gump in a movie before, and for that matter I've never seen a movie quite like Forrest Gump. Any attempt to describe him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Or a dream.The screenplay by Eric Roth has the complexity of modern fiction, not the formulas of modern movies. Its hero, played by Tom Hanks, is a thoroughly decent man with an IQ of 75, who manages between the 1950s and the 1980s to become involved in every major event in American history. And he survives them all with only honesty and niceness as his shields.And yet this is not a heartwarming story about a mentally retarded man. That cubbyhole is much too small and limiting for Forrest Gump. The movie is more of a meditation on our times, as seen through the eyes of a man who lacks cynicism and takes things for exactly what they are. Watch him carefully and you will understand why some people are criticized for being too clever by half. Forrest is clever by just exactly enough.Tom Hanks may be the only actor who could have played the role.I can't think of anyone else as Gump, after seeing how Hanks makes him into a person so dignified, so straight-ahead. The performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths.Forrest is born to an Alabama boardinghouse owner (Sally Field) who tries to correct his posture by making him wear braces, but who never criticizes his mind. When Forrest is called stupid, his mother tells him, Stupid is as stupid does, and Forrest turns out to be incapable of doing anything less than profound. Also, when the braces finally fall from his legs, it turns out he can run like the wind.That's how he gets a college football scholarship, in a life story that eventually becomes a running gag about his good luck. Gump the football hero becomes Gump the Medal of Honor winner in Vietnam, and then Gump the Ping-Pong champion, Gump the shrimp boat captain, Gump the millionaire stockholder (he gets shares in a new fruit company named Apple Computer), and Gump the man who runs across America and then retraces his steps.It could be argued that with his IQ of 75 Forrest does not quite understand everything that happens to him. Not so. He understands everything he needs to know, and the rest, the movie suggests, is just surplus. He even understands everything that's important about love, although Jenny, the girl he falls in love with in grade school and never falls out of love with, tells him, Forrest, you don't know what love is. She is a stripper by that time.The movie is ingenious in taking Forrest on his tour of recent American history. The director, Robert Zemeckis, is experienced with the magic that special effects can do (his credits include the Back To The Future movies and Who Framed Roger Rabbit), and here he uses computerized visual legerdemain to place Gump in historic situations with actual people.Forrest stands next to the schoolhouse door with George Wallace, he teaches Elvis how to swivel his hips, he visits the White House three times, he's on the Dick Cavett show with John Lennon, and in a sequence that will have you rubbing your eyes with its realism, he addresses a Vietnam-era peace rally on the Mall in Washington. Special effects are also used in creating the character of Forrest's Vietnam friend Lt.

Any attempt to describe him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Or a dream.The screenplay by Eric Roth has the complexity of modern fiction, not the formulas of modern movies. Its hero, played by Tom Hanks, is a thoroughly decent man with an IQ of 75, who manages between the 1950s and the 1980s to become involved in every major event in American history. And he survives them all with only honesty and niceness as his shields.And yet this is not a heartwarming story about a mentally retarded man. That cubbyhole is much too small and limiting for Forrest Gump. The movie is more of a meditation on our times, as seen through the eyes of a man who lacks cynicism and takes things for exactly what they are. Watch him carefully and you will understand why some people are criticized for being too clever by half. Forrest is clever by just exactly enough.Tom Hanks may be the only actor who could have played the role.I can't think of anyone else as Gump, after seeing how Hanks makes him into a person so dignified, so straight-ahead. The performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths.Forrest is born to an Alabama boardinghouse owner (Sally Field) who tries to correct his posture by making him wear braces, but who never criticizes his mind. When Forrest is called stupid, his mother tells him, Stupid is as stupid does, and Forrest turns out to be incapable of doing anything less than profound. Also, when the braces finally fall from his legs, it turns out he can run like the wind.That's how he gets a college football scholarship, in a life story that eventually becomes a running gag about his good luck. Gump the football hero becomes Gump the Medal of Honor winner in Vietnam, and then Gump the Ping-Pong champion, Gump the shrimp boat captain, Gump the millionaire stockholder (he gets shares in a new fruit company named Apple Computer), and Gump the man who runs across America and then retraces his steps.It could be argued that with his IQ of 75 Forrest does not quite understand everything that happens to him. Not so. He understands everything he needs to know, and the rest, the movie suggests, is just surplus. He even understands everything that's important about love, although Jenny, the girl he falls in love with in grade school and never falls out of love with, tells him, Forrest, you don't know what love is. She is a stripper by that time.The movie is ingenious in taking Forrest on his tour of recent American history. The director, Robert Zemeckis, is experienced with the magic that special effects can do (his credits include the Back To The Future movies and Who Framed Roger Rabbit), and here he uses computerized visual legerdemain to place Gump in historic situations with actual people.Forrest stands next to the schoolhouse door with George Wallace, he teaches Elvis how to swivel his hips, he visits the White House three times, he's on the Dick Cavett show with John Lennon, and in a sequence that will have you rubbing your eyes with its realism, he addresses a Vietnam-era peace rally on the Mall in Washington.

Side effects of the formula begin to drive him insane and he goes on a rampage across the countryside with police baffled about how to stop a killer they can't even see! What a fantastic movie. Possibly the best script of any of the Universal horror films. James Whale, director of the first two classic Frankenstein films, does an amazing job here tackling a special effects-laden movie that was ahead of its time. These effects are in a class by themselves for the period in which they were produced. We can find faults with them today but in 1933 they must have been pretty mind-blowing.Not enough good things can be said about Claude Rains here. Despite not being able to see his face until the film's final scene, he commands the entire movie with a magnetic performance. Boris Karloff was the original choice to play the role. As much as I love Karloff, I can't see him bringing the same manic intensity to the part that Rains does. It would have been a much different film, to be sure. Perhaps not worse, but definitely different.The rest of the cast is good, as well. Beautiful Gloria Stuart plays the love interest. Henry Travers is her kindly father and Griffin's employer. He was years away from being an Angel, Second Class but always a likable and reliable actor. William Harrigan plays the unlikable Kemp who pays the ultimate price for crossing Griffin in one of the film's most memorable scenes.

Flashback to the year 1961, where the streets of New York City were filled with two rivaling gangs, the recently immigrated Puerto Rican Sharks, and the defending white natives the Jets. Each respective gang with a leader, to whom the entire gang looks to for advice, and would protect until the very end proves the movie's overall theme of loyalty. However, complications arise when outsiders, somehow related to either gang (Maria is the Sharks leader's sister) fall in love with each other at first sight and decide to spend the rest of their lives together. Begging the question, will either gang put aside their differences so these two lovebirds can be together? Based on Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, the movie of West Side Story contains elements that could satisfy anyone. The opening Prologue, proves, through Jerome Robbins use of aerial shots of the surrounding city contrasting Leonard Bernstein's instrumental, that an intricate action scene is about to take place. The vivid incorporation of ballet, mixed with the sporty style dance fighting is so incredibly detailed, an obvious homage to Gene Kelly's masculine dancing style that became popular after his critically acclaimed Singin' in the Rain debuted. This scene introduces a new genre of gangster fight dancing, which can be argued as an early hip hop dance style, popularized modernly and seen throughout the movie. There is a reason the movie has earned 19 awards and 7 overall nominations. Each scene transitions flawlessly, introducing more action, drama and other popular genres along the way. Elements of the tragic play are emphasized, including the exaggerated love story for the hopeless romantic. John Astin relieves the heavy drama with comedic relief during the dance scene\/Mambo number. Even the obsessive musical theater major will enjoy this movie. Overall, an audience interested in multiple stylistic qualities can follow the movie, which is what makes this film an overall classic.The music incorporated furthers the storyline without interrupting key aspects of character development, like in other musical movies, meaning songs don't just appear because this is a musical. The songs are so catchy, you'll be singing them days after you've witnessed the movie. Each song serves a purpose, sometimes surpassing the duologue in the film. In fact, the songs without singing tend to be the movies best, enhancing the dancing visuals, intensifying the storyline. The placement of every song may differ from the musical, for good reason, moving the light-hearted numbers to the beginning act, and saving the darker songs for the second. Some musical theater buffs would argue against the authenticity of this but by doing so Robbins somehow added more heart to an already emotional piece simultaneously ensuring the film's originality. Each actor possessed the emotionality behind every song in every scene, which is why some earned Academy Awards for their portrayals. However, a majority of the cast was dubbed over by trained singing professionals. Common for film on this era, the idea behind awarding someone for work that wasn't entirely their own seems cheated. The dubbing was fairly obvious in certain scenes as well, making it very distracting (Rita Moreno and Natalie Wood were both dubbed by the same singer at one point in Tonight, which made the harmony sound like it was being sung in one key). Keeping in mind the generation to which this movie debuted, and how incredible the acting is, the sound discrepancy can be overlooked. The camera style and seamless combination of colors in the set contrasting the climatic scenes during the film should be admired almost as much as the acting. The use of multiple angles throughout the film made it more realistic, and added a perspective that couldn't normally be seen through the musical (because of it's stationary viewpoint on stage). The sets resembled an authentic version of New York in the 1960's. The tall skyscrapers, fire escape behind every apartment and graffiti written buildings helped audiences believe that the film actually took place in New York. Scene's containing both Tony and Maria sometimes showed a blurred background, making it seem like they were the only people and nothing else mattered. Every scene was more breathtaking than the last, making the film one of the greatest musical adaptations even today.Following certain ridiculous qualities of the original play however proved the film's faults in storyline. The two main characters that fall in love despite their feuding families, don't really know each other that well but are willing to put everything aside to pursue this relationship. This becomes incredibly absurd when Maria finds out that her lover killed her brother, and instead of being upset immediately sleeps with him. From a realist perspective it seems pretty bizarre to forgive someone that quickly for murdering your sibling just because you love him or her. This plot line parallels Shakespeare's equally ridiculous suicide scene that could have easily been avoided if either respected an outsider's opinion over their own, which is again seen in this film during its climatic scene. Tony upset of Maria's death, runs through the streets trying to be killed because he couldn't live without his true love, essentially causing his demise in the process. This was an incredibly frustrating aspect of the film, but needless to say falls under the romantic genre smoothly.Besides the minor flaws, the overall quality of the film garners respect not only to the filmmakers but also to the incredible cast. Even though the movie came out over fifty years ago, it still maintains relevancy, making it a classic must-see. The expression they just don't make movies like this anymore, directly correlated with this film. No matter how many times viewed the ending scene with Natalie Wood threatening to take her own life will bring any audience member to tears. It's extremely well made, and easily and overall favorite.

Un-American super snitch Elia Kazan might as well have plunged a knife into John Garfield's (David, here) back. What makes Kazan particularly odious as the most infamous creep in Hollywood history is him being such a hypocritical wolf in sheep's clothing, which is probably why GENTLEMEN'S AGREEMENT rings about as false as ON THE WATERFRONT (Kazan's Mea Culpa for making fascists squirm with his first best picture). To foist these two diametric opposite films on Americans featuring actors such as Gregory Peck and Marlon Brando suggests that Kazan himself was the best actor of them all, cleverly hiding his two-faced willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone in the interest of his own self-preservation and personal aggrandizement.

Let's face it, there are some acts you just can't follow. How do you follow one of the biggest popcorn movies in cinema history, an adventure so spectacular that it earned an Oscar nomination for Best Picture and has become part of our common language? In lesser hands, this second adventure might have been a repeat of the same formula trotted out with nothing new to discover. But Steven Spielberg and George Lucas are not lesser hands. They have used their collective imaginations to create something special and even in trying to follow-up a grand adventure like Raiders you can feel that they wanted to try something new. Temple of Doom is not Raiders. It is a red-blooded adventure that moves with a life and energy all its own.This isn't even a sequel, it actually takes place a year before his search for the lost ark, though it never makes predictions or allusions. Like the pulp novel adventures that inspired it, this is simply another adventure in the travels of Indiana Jones. The familiar elements are all there, even a plucky kid at his side, an Asian boy called Short Round who acts as a sort-of moral compass. It is always in the tradition of these stories that a sidekick is necessary, usually a non-American who gets the hero out of trouble. And of course, there's a love interest, this time an American entertainer named Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) whose function in the plot is to be dragged along and occasionally rescued.The movie hurtles these characters from one damn thing to another. Temple of Doom is in the tradition of great movie adventures in which the plot is stew of craziness encompassing all manner of chases, fights, shoot-outs, hedonistic cults, mystic artifacts, booby traps, gross-outs, a diabolical plot to take over the world, and the always reliable scene in which the hero is hanging from a cliff by his fingernails. The movie never denies us any of these things, nor does it make them standard or boring. It has just as much urgency as the earlier film, but not in dealing with the Nazis becoming all-powerful. Here the plot is a little more personal, but no less diabolical.This adventure is a little darker, meaner. The earlier film was a grand, globe-trotting adventure featuring Indiana as a man sent on a mission to keep the Nazis from ruling the world. Here, Indiana kind of backs into the plot. It's not his mission, but he takes it anyway, landing in India via a plane crash he finds himself in a small village desolated by the theft of an ancient stone with magical properties. The earlier film traveled the world; this one takes Indy down, down, down into the deep chasms of a forgotten Hindu temple where ritual sacrifices include ripping out your heart before tossing you into a pit of lava. The prize is a sacred stone that was stolen from a humble Indian village. The stone is no Ark of the Covenant, but when it lights up, it's pretty impressive.In fact, the whole production looks impressive. The temple where the human sacrifices are held glows with a fiery redness, as if it was one level up from Hell itself (there's an indication that it actually is). The caverns beneath the earth, where the children work as slave, actually looks like an underground cavern, not a theme park attraction.Spielberg and his writing team have also done a good job of keeping their lead character consistent. One of the great things about Indiana Jones is his vulnerability. He is intelligent and fallible, always pushing forward, heedless of the danger. He's not just a peg to move around the plot. He's interesting, and we like him, even when he's taken into darker territory. The same cannot be said, I'm afraid, for the film's chief weakness, Indy's leading lady. Raiders gave us Marion, a tough talking gutsy broad who greeted our hero with a clip to the jaw. Here we get Willie Scott, an American nightclub singer whose chief characteristic is that she whines and screams a lot. Kate Capshaw is a good actress with a winning smile, but she's given a bad role. A little of her goes a long way.Even still, the movie is a grand adventure, breathless, fast-moving and a great deal of fun. If it doesn't measure up, then it's only because of the adventure that preceded it. You can't fault Lucas and Spielberg for not measuring up, nor can you fault their desire to mine this territory again.**** (of four) ","genre":null},{"date":"24 February 2014","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" The most refreshing thing about Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is the fact that this is not a retread of Raiders of the Lost Ark .

Major Payne (Castle 1995), directed by Nick Castle, is no except to this ideology. Making over 29 million dollars since being released in March of 1995, the movie definitely had a specific target audience (imdb.com). This movie was for teens and tweens with stereotypical middle school boy humor. Major Payne is a comedy that portrays a hardened killing machine of a soldier who is transformed into a loving, friendly father\/mentor figure.After watching this film, people will either absolutely love it or hate it. The script is full of hilarious one liners and bodily function type humor; while incredibly funny to some people it may be considered childish and impractical to others. Major Payne employs the use of stereotypes from start to finish. It is used in character development, the storyline, and even the film's musical score. None of the stereotypes disappoint. They are funny, well timed, and make for a movie that is hard to forget. Ultimately, Major Payne could end up being one of the next great cult classics like Monty Python The Holy Grail.One of the wisest choices of the entire movie is the use of music throughout the film. At the start, Major Payne (the hardened soldier) is taking over a city and its drug lord single- handedly. The song Bad to the Bone is playing in the background typifying Payne's badass persona. Later in the movie, the song RESPECT is played to increase the comedic side of the story as well as increase the amount of sympathy for the boys in the JROTC and Ms. Walburn. Finally, at the end, while Major Payne is waiting for his train and completing his characters' transformation, the theme song for The Donna Reed Show plays in the background. Payne has gone from killer to father figure and the music has gone from hard rock to a sickenly sweet family friendly tune.Another aspect of the film is the choice of actors. Damon Wayans plays his role perfectly as Major Payne. His personality and standup comedy routine-like performance is exactly what makes Payne so funny and likable. He deadpans his lines as the killing machine of a soldier and yet has a very distinctive and trademark laugh to help with his transition as mentor\/father. As for the character of Ms. Emily Walburn, Karyn Parsons is an incredibly bubbly individual who is precisely what every student would want in a school nurse. She is extremely attractive and dressed in short skirts, tender, motherly, and nurturing to a fault with the boys. Additionally, Steven Martini stars as Cadet Alex Stone. While Major Payne is the main character and undergoes the biggest transformation of character, Alex Stone's supporting character is the one the audience will most easily identify with throughout the movie. Stone's persona is that of a kid with a troubled past, an over-bearing stepfather, he is not respectful of authority, as well as refuses to take anything seriously. Payne's and Stone's character transformations are affected by each other. As Payne begins to soften, Stone becomes more sure of himself. As Major Payne begins to show interest and concern for him, Stone begins to show desire, respect, and proves to be a very effective leader. In the end, we see him as the heart and soul of the squad and having confidence in his own abilities along with the other cadets. The little used aspect of narration in the film provides context about situations in the movie. Throughout, Major Payne acts as the narrator to further show how tough of a marine he really is. One scene has him riding over to Madison Academy in a military hummer. Major Payne narrates by saying, Finally after two whole weeks of living a civilian's puke existence, I was back in the corps, back in uniform, and back to the sweet smell of mustard gas. We are left with little to the imagination as to how tough Major Payne is supposed to be as the marine and drill sergeant.The story line is a familiar one tough guy comes in, a woman and some lovable kids melt away his toughness, then a happily ever after ending to finish it all off. But while this is a comedy feature film, the underlying story is one of hard work, perseverance, and family. So even though a ten year boy will laugh and laugh at all the gags and crude humor, any parent would be happy to take their kids to see these kinds of values portrayed on the big screen. I know as an eight year old I loved the humor and memorized tons of lines that made even my grandparents laugh as I repeated the quips that included curse words. Major Payne shows the boys working together and becoming a family with Payne's mentoring. Payne goes from soldier\/killer to mentor with a girlfriend. Ultimately, Major Payne works as a film because Damon Wayans portrays his character perfectly (Ebert). The movie is light hearted, funny, and memorable. It is also my family's favorite and has provided us with many fun evenings together. All in all, I would give Major Payne a 5 out of 5 star rating as a must-see movie because of the comedy and execution of the story line.Work Cited Major Payne. Dir. Nick Castle. Perf.

Trying to hit a judge is bad but apparently not as bad as calling the cops because he thought a crazy client of his might kill people, which is a conflict of interest. Makes sense.There is another judge in the story who is purely suicidal. He spend his lunches on the ledge of the 4th-floor, pilots helicopters with limited fuel supplies, and attempt to shoot his head off with a long rifle in his bathroom before court starts. Next to him, the Joker is the picture child for mental stability.The climax of the movie is the courtroom scene where Arthur is making his opening statement. He stops midway and announces that he can't continue because his client's guilty. The presiding judge tells him he's out of order to which Arthur yells back No, YOU'RE out of order! indicating to everybody that his comebacks have the wit of a 6-year old. Incredibly, the courtroom audience erupts in applause, give him a standing ovation, and the accused judge is seen with his head in his hands, all telling us, that the defendant will finally pay for his crimes. Unbelievable. I have seen more tactical argumentation from Creationists.Arthur is then seen sitting on the steps of the courthouse where Jay, who is clearly wearing a wig, is ready to come in. Jay salutes Arthur by lifting his wig off like you would a hat as a gesture of politeness. This surreal scene tops anything in the movie. Even in his drunken foolishness, the director must have thought the same, which is why the credits started rolling right after... complete with bland disco beats!

Directed by Joe Pytka, it was released on November 15, 1996 in theatres worldwide. This mix of an animated and non-animated movie was a huge success, which can be proved by its box office success, grossing a total of $90,443,603 (Space Jam). But, what makes this movie so great? What makes this movie different from all the other movies out there? The creators of Space Jam craftily combined actors, different audience appeals, and parallelism with reality into a movie adored by critics and the public alike. The actor choice in Space Jam is not something to overlook. Everyone knows and loves Michael Jordan, who played for the University of North Carolina in college and the Chicago Bulls and Washington Wizards in the NBA (Michael Jordan Bio.). Besides the great Air Jordan, there are other famous basketball players in the movie, including Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, Shawn Bradley, and the great Larry Bird. Moving away from basketball stars, this film also features Wayne Knight, who played Newman on Seinfeld, and Theresa Randle, who also starred in films Bad Boys and Beverly Hills Cop II. And of course, who can forget the Looney Tunes. Every character from the show appears in this movie, including Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, the Tasmanian Devil, and introducing Lola Bunny, Bugs' sweetheart (Space Jam. IMDb). All of these characters are vital in feeding audience's attraction to this movie. The child appeal for this movie is pretty obvious. First off, most kids are going to want to prefer animation in a film than no animation at all. And of course, you have the Looney Tunes. Although they were around more prevalently from 1970s through the 1990s than now, all the kids during 1996 knew who they were because of The Looney Tunes Show. The antics they pull in this movie are hilarious, anywhere from the cleaning the gym with spit to Daffy showing off his curves in a mini fashion show. Although a lot of Space Jam's content is geared toward the young, adults definitely do not have a hard time sitting down with their kids to watch it. Although it is cartoon, adults truly do appreciate Space Jam. The actors, especially the NBA players, are very familiar to the adult audience of the time. Plus, there is a sense of happiness watching MJ, whether he is acting or playing basketball in a cartoon gym. Some adult humor is also present in the movie, like the reference to Ghostbusters, Charles Barkley's relations with Madonna, and a therapist asking Patrick Ewing about being unable to perform in other areas in his life. These small things go unnoticed by kids, but the movie's funny comments and the true parts of MJ's life keep the adults entertained. Like in the classic movie Forrest Gump, Space Jam has real history events embedded in its plot. In the opening credits, highlights of Jordan's years playing for UNC and the Bulls are shown. Then, during the movie, he retired from the NBA and went on to play baseball. This all took place, playing for the Tar Heels from 1981 to 1984, the Bulls from '84-'94, and baseball during the '94-'95 season (Michael Jordan Bio.). During the entire movie, he plays baseball, which he is terrible at, just like in real life. At the end of the movie, MJ decides to come back to basketball with the Bulls once again. Because of the parallelism with reality, I think that one of goals of Space Jam was to make a story about how playing for the Tune Squad motivated Jordan to quit baseball and play basketball once again. Critically speaking, Space Jam got positive reviews by credible movie reviewers. Peper Stack, a Chronicle Staff Critic, said that Space Jam is littered with laughs, partly owing to the interplay among Murray, Bird (Larry, not Tweety) and Jordan, and a giddy on-court pacing that brings brain function to a halt. Bugs has some great lines; inspired jokes take swipes at Warner Bros. rival Disney as well as humans who don't really have a clue about toon life (Shooting Hoops&#x85;). Even the famous Roger Ebert called it delightful. He said he thought the movie was funny, especially how it takes a jab at Disney (Space Jam). Even though the movie can be cheesy sometimes, the critics seemed to have really enjoyed it. The creators of Space Jam were geniuses. They took famous basketball players and the classic Looney Tunes characters and put them into an 88-minute film with a great American sport (Space Jam). Honestly, if you have never seen this movie, you are really missing out. The actors, audience appeal, and parallelism with reality intricately combine into the classic movie Space Jam, a timeless classic that you and the critics will want to watch over and over.Works Cited Ebert, Roger.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"24 February 2014","score":"","review":" Though I am not the biggest aficionado of romantic comedies, but there are two romantic comedies that that are absolutely spell-binding. The first one is Annie Hall and the other one is the classic 1989 movie When Harry Met Sally. What makes When Harry Met Sally standout is the glaring energetic integrity it has backed up by the equally compelling script by the late Nora Ephron which goes beyond the formulaic run-of-the-mill boy-meets-girl cliché that most romantic comedies suffer through.The emotional build-up has a lot coming for it from the beginning and never once does it ever go back. Harry Burns (Billy Crystal) and Sally Albright (Meg Ryan) have been meeting each several times since 1977. They first started off as total strangers as they drive together from Chicago to New York City as sexual intentions eventually keep them apart. Years later, they run into each other now both career-oriented (Harry is political consultant and Sally is a journalist). The charisma and the chemistry between Crystal and Ryan wants us to see their characters fall in love and get married. Sadly, they are still head-blocked by their previous relationships which put them at doubt of committing to getting into another relationship.The feisty performances of the two leading stars compliments nicely to the script that Ephron wrote. Even though Billy Crystal has a one-dimensional character, he still manages to pull off some sleaziness within the character of Harry Burns. Whereas Sally has a personality that changes in many different places. When we are first introduced to her she comes off as a vulnerable determined college graduate ready to take on all challenges that the world wishes to throw at us. But with all the trials and tribulations that manifest with the issues on relationships which gives her a newer more alert perspective of the world around her. Ryan goes through this transition so naturally, we never really see it coming.Ephron was a master in her own craft writing script filled with a cornucopia of hilarious perspective of human relationships throughout her career as a scriptwriter. Here in When Harry Met Sally, we look through both genders perspectives about relationships on an even field. Harry sees that men and women have sex does not have room just being friends. That applies to anyone who has been in a relationship before. Every scene has a reason, even the brief scene with the elderly couples also contributes the purpose of this movie.Over the years, director Rob Reiner has made mediocre as of late. But it is very pleasing that When Harry Met Sally was released we can reflect back to when he made quality films like these. His colorful direction and Ephron and her brilliant script make just as much of an effective couple as Harry and Sally were. The endearing couple are so likable we actually care if they get together no matter what direction in life they wish to pursue.
