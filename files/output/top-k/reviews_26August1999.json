However when I was watching this, I couldn't keep it out of my head, I kept comparing this to ANALYZE THIS.  It's another mob movie with comedy that works at parts, and is weak in others. Hugh Grant plays Michael Felgate, a Englishman in New York City working as a antique art dealer.  He is in love with a school teacher named Gina,(played by the beautiful Jeanne Tripplehorn) and would like to marry her.  The only problem is Gina's family, not her immediate family, the family her father Frank (James Cann) is involved with, a mafia family.  So Michael wants to make a good impression with these people, and he does it quite well, at first.  Frank is very pleased that his daughter is marrying someone decent.   The family head, Uncle Vito (Burt Young) is also pleased with Michael, and wants to use him for a hidden money laundry scheme.  Then all of the trouble begins, and things keep getting worse and worse for poor Michael. This was a so-so comedy, I was pleased to see some mob jokes being used that ANALYZE THIS didn't cover, and the acting was also good.  Grant is funny at times, but at other times is quite annoying.  When Grant tries to put on a gangster accent, he doesn't sound like a gangster, he sounds more like John Kennedy, which is a bit tiresome.  Cann is decent as the mafia father who assists Michael through his entire troubles.  And Tripplehorn is also good as the confused and worried girlfriend and daughter of the two men in trouble.  But if anyone steals the show, it's mafia regular Joeseph Viterelli playing one of the associates of the mafia.  Viterelli does have funny moments in this film, but not as much as he did in ANALYZE THIS.  But just seeing him again after the excellent ANALYZE THIS is a nice welcome. I did get a headache while watching MICKEY BLUE EYES, not from the quality of the film, but just on the situations that these people get themselves into.  The viewer wonders on how much more trouble can these people get into, and how in the world can they ever get out of it?The reason on why I enjoyed ANALYZE THIS more is because it had actors act unlike they normally would (De Niro crying and making all of the jokes, Crystal being the straight man). Where MICKEY BLUE EYES has the actors act like they normally would in any of their other movies, Grant the bumbling fool, Cann the tough-guy, and Tripplehorn the girl in distress. Overall, MICKEY BLUE EYES is o.k., but not great.  If you enjoy Grant's comedies, then this is one of his better, but it's nowhere as good as NOTTING HILL.  And it's good to see James Cann play a good guy again.  I would reccommend that if you want to see a good mob comedy, then rent ANALYZE THIS. If you already seen ANALYZE THIS, then it's o.k. to go ahead and see this film. But by the film's credits, you'll probably say, it wasn't as funny as ANALYZE THIS.

However, as faith would have it, my new school is by the theater in town showing foreign and independent films.  You know the kind of films, the brilliant ones that are shown on The Independent Film Channel, Sundance Channel, and BRAVO!  Now I am proud to review my first (of hopefully many) foreign or independent film, and the film is entitled CONTE D' AUTOMNE (AUTUMN TALE). This film has an appropriate title, since most of the character's in this film are in the Autumn years of their life.  The main character is Magali (Beatrice Romand) a widow who lives in the southern part of France and runs a vineyard. Her children (a son and daughter) are both adults and have gone on their own ways, which leaves her lonely.  So her friend Isabelle (Marie Riviere) decides to secretly put in a ad, in the local newspaper under the singles section, looking for a man for Magali.  However, Magali's son's girlfriend, Rosine (played by the very attractive Alexa Portal) decides to also help Magali, by having Magali meet Rosine's older ex-boyfriend Etienne (Didier Sandre), who was also Rosine's former teacher. Then Isabelle's ad got answered in the paper by a lonely man who just moved back to France from Egypt named Gerald (Alain Libolt).  Gerald has something in common with Magali, they both worked on a vineyard.  However, Gerald thinks that the person that is looking for someone to meet is is Isabelle, and Isabelle is happily married. I found AUTUMN TALE to be a nicely put and sweet story. The story has elements of a Shakespeare comedy, with some nice bits of modern romance.  I highly enjoyed the acting, especially by Alain Libolt, the man who plays the love struck Gerald.  When Isabelle is talking to Gerald, the viewer can see and tell by Gerald's eyes, that he is completely awe struck by Isabelle's beauty.  I also found the story fun and enjoyable, granted it's not original or brilliant, but it is fun. I saw AUTUMN TALE after hearing many critic's (especially Roger Ebert) rave and praise this film.  I was glad that I did see it, and it really grabed my intrest in watching some more of Rohmer's films.  I also found out that AUTUMN TALE is Rohmer's third of his season films, so now I have yet to see his other two, and am also looking forward to it. AUTUMN TALE is the kind of romantic comedy that stays away from the American style of a romantic\/comedy (i.e. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY & AMERICAN PIE).  No gross jokes or words are used, it's just funny situations at perfect timing.  If AUTUMN TALE happens to be showing in your town, then I would suggest that you should go see it.  It's fun, heart-warming, and it's something that one wouldn't be embarrassed to take the older folks to. However I must warn some people, this is a sub-titled film, and you'll have to read the dialogue.  There are a lot of people that I know, who won't step foot into a theater with a movie with subtitles.  And that is a major shame, because they will miss some of the cinema's little treasures, like this film.  ****1\/2 (out of five) ","genre":null},{"date":"26 August 1999","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  It's hard for me to see a foreign film, they are only showing in one theater in the Phoenix area.

However, as faith would have it, my new school is by the theater in town showing foreign and independent films.  You know the kind of films, the brilliant ones that are shown on The Independent Film Channel, Sundance Channel, and BRAVO!  Now I am proud to review my first (of hopefully many) foreign or independent film, and the film is entitled CONTE D' AUTOMNE (AUTUMN TALE). This film has an appropriate title, since most of the character's in this film are in the Autumn years of their life.  The main character is Magali (Beatrice Romand) a widow who lives in the southern part of France and runs a vineyard. Her children (a son and daughter) are both adults and have gone on their own ways, which leaves her lonely.  So her friend Isabelle (Marie Riviere) decides to secretly put in a ad, in the local newspaper under the singles section, looking for a man for Magali.  However, Magali's son's girlfriend, Rosine (played by the very attractive Alexa Portal) decides to also help Magali, by having Magali meet Rosine's older ex-boyfriend Etienne (Didier Sandre), who was also Rosine's former teacher. Then Isabelle's ad got answered in the paper by a lonely man who just moved back to France from Egypt named Gerald (Alain Libolt).  Gerald has something in common with Magali, they both worked on a vineyard.  However, Gerald thinks that the person that is looking for someone to meet is is Isabelle, and Isabelle is happily married. I found AUTUMN TALE to be a nicely put and sweet story. The story has elements of a Shakespeare comedy, with some nice bits of modern romance.  I highly enjoyed the acting, especially by Alain Libolt, the man who plays the love struck Gerald.  When Isabelle is talking to Gerald, the viewer can see and tell by Gerald's eyes, that he is completely awe struck by Isabelle's beauty.  I also found the story fun and enjoyable, granted it's not original or brilliant, but it is fun. I saw AUTUMN TALE after hearing many critic's (especially Roger Ebert) rave and praise this film.  I was glad that I did see it, and it really grabed my intrest in watching some more of Rohmer's films.  I also found out that AUTUMN TALE is Rohmer's third of his season films, so now I have yet to see his other two, and am also looking forward to it. AUTUMN TALE is the kind of romantic comedy that stays away from the American style of a romantic\/comedy (i.e. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY & AMERICAN PIE).  No gross jokes or words are used, it's just funny situations at perfect timing.  If AUTUMN TALE happens to be showing in your town, then I would suggest that you should go see it.  It's fun, heart-warming, and it's something that one wouldn't be embarrassed to take the older folks to. However I must warn some people, this is a sub-titled film, and you'll have to read the dialogue.  There are a lot of people that I know, who won't step foot into a theater with a movie with subtitles.

Watching it then, I felt it was a well-written movie and an event that I would one day hope to experience myself.  Watching it now as a person in my young\/mid twenties, I realize that I've experienced a feeling very similar to this movie Being independent and actually falling in love.That experience was brief, honest, and fulfilling, leaving an impression on me that I'll always remember.  This film generates those same feelings for me, and watching this movie after my own experience, I can only see myself in Jesse's place, living out my own similar situations.This movie is one of the finest, most underappreciated (in my opinion) romantic stories of the '90's.  It's a very real movie, and it's an accurate portrayal of what it feels like to meet someone who you just instantly click with.  No gripping score, no dramatic good-bye only to be surprise reunited at the end.  Before Sunrise portrays all of its messages with the sincere awkwardness of a beginning relationship, a bit of insightful conversation, and two people with similar views and interests finding each other. Delpy and Hawke don't play stereotypes in this movie.  They play people, and that's what makes this film so interesting.  The pacing of the film is slow, yet time seems to rush by.  These are people you could actually meet.  These people could actually be you.When Before Sunrise ends, there's no contrived, cheesy good-bye, it just ends, which is how life works.  It leaves the possibilities open, but not in the way that you could see a sequel being made. If anyone has ever felt like this in a relationship, this movie will never ring truer than it does.  For those who have yet to find that bit of spontaneous adventure, Before Sunrise is a good guide of what to look for.I can't recommend this movie highly enough.  An intelligent, inspiring film.

We all know how the overuse and dependency of drugs can destroy a life, the gripping struggle many endure to pull themselves out of that toilet, and the ruin they can bring to others around them. But Trainspotting is a movie that shows more than just the dark travails of this ugly trip as the movie 'Basketball Diaries' does to excruciating detail. It reaffirms why life, as is wonderfully described in a Dylan like way by Ewan McGregor in the beginning of the movie, is worth living. What separates this movie and elevates it from other movies that cover this same tone and subject material is that the main character is not totally destroyed and left in a dark hopeless state at the end just to emphasize the why you shouldn't do drugs lesson. The movie ends with great hope and answers McGregor's own opening question of why choose life. And I will say emphatically again it is one hell of a ride. We follow McGregor and his excellently casted mates through all the stages of drug abuse and the Alice in Wonderland like adventures that follow it. Robert Carlye played the volatile Francis Begbie to an Oscar like perfection. His outburst struck me like a dark comedy where you almost hate to laugh but your true honesty leaves you no choice. Definitely one of the most memorable characters from a movie in the 90's.  From drug dens to night clubs the cast mixes so well. The humor bounces wildly off the wall like something you get out of a gum ball machine. You never know when it will jump out in front of you so be ready. Danny Boyle deserves a great nod and a raise of the glass for a directing job well done. He chooses shots from great angles and adds all kinds of perfectly captured perks as well. One of my favorite scenes is the shot from the floor as McGregor has just taken a large hit of heroin. He proceeds to sink into a large red rug right through the floor. Every proceeding shot is from this unusual point of view until he is brought out of his dazed state at a local hospital. For someone who has never done heroin (and doesn't particularly plan to) this is one of the feelings I can imagine the drug delivering me to as I watch McGregor dip into the floor. That folks is a sign of a good director. When you have a camera in your hands and you want to have the audience truly feel what something is like why just tell them? Too easy and makes for a dull movie. Which is an incurable disease eighty percent of filmmakers have today. Show them dammit!! Use your imagination and create uniqueness. Make your movie stand out. The soundtrack compliments Trainspotting to a tee and adds to the movie's slick electric settings and rich cinematography. The only slight problem with the movie is that at times some of the Scottish accents get as thick as something out of a broken espresso machine. You will find yourself trying to understand what the hell is being said but just pay attention to what is going on within the scene and you will make it through with flying colors. This movie was not what I expected. It thrilled me in many different ways and added new life to subject material that I am sure hasn't seen the last foot tracks come its way.

I was having trouble staying awake for most of it.  Little and no musical accompaniment didn't help.  There were about 3 'gotchas' when considering the length of the movie, there could have had at least 10.  I figured out the 'surprise' ending less then half way through the film.  The only bright point was the acting in the kid.  A couple of scenes were overacted just a tad, but this little guy is overall a fine actor.  The mother did a good job too in a working-class role.  I did love the shots of Philadelphia.  It was nice to see Bruce Willis without a gun in his hand.  I feel he did an adequate job in his role.  I think the only reason people are raving about it is because he has had so many macho roles that people had typecast him.   I think most people liked it because they didn't foresee the ending.  For those of us that did, the movie wasn't nearly as fun.  My recommendation is if you have to see it, wait for it on video.

I was having trouble staying awake for most of it.  Little and no musical accompaniment didn't help.  There were about 3 'gotchas' when considering the length of the movie, there could have had at least 10.  I figured out the 'surprise' ending less then half way through the film.  The only bright point was the acting in the kid.  A couple of scenes were overacted just a tad, but this little guy is overall a fine actor.  The mother did a good job too in a working-class role.  I did love the shots of Philadelphia.  It was nice to see Bruce Willis without a gun in his hand.  I feel he did an adequate job in his role.

","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"26 August 1999","score":"","review":"  This remake was exactly like I expected it to be. a remake of the original. But come on, did we really need to see Norman Bates masturbating at the sight of Anne Heche? I didn't think it was that bad, but I did not like Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates. Every time he did that aw-shucks laugh I wanted to punch him. I am thoroughly convinced that Vaughn is the only one that showed up for the casting call. I did however like Jullianne Moore and William H. Macy. I thought they did well in their parts, replacing Vera Miles and Martin Balsam, who also did excellently in their roles. Even though Macy's character was killed after only a short time. It's okay to see, but if you haven't, go see the original. It's a lot better, and Anthony Perkins does an excellent job in a character that he is always most remembered for.
