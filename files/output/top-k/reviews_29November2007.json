One day, near Christmas, he reaches for a pair of black gloves in a department store and finds someone else is intent on grabbing them, also. Sarah (Kate Beckinsale), a pretty psychology student, has chosen them for a gift but is willing to concede them to Jonathan, as there are no other pairs available. But, Jonathan insists that she buy them and they part company. But, a short while later, they meet again on the same spot, mainly because Jonathan has left his scarf behind and Sara is still shopping. Now, declares Jonathan, this is fate throwing them together and they should go get a cup of coffee together. They end up at an ice cream shop called Serendipity, a favorite of Sarah's and then they head over to the local ice rink. Jonathan wants Sarah's digits, despite the fact that both he and Sarah are involved with others. But, after writing down her telephone number, the wind wrestles the slip of paper out of Jon's hands. Sarah says she believes in fate, too, and that the timing must not be right. So, Jon goes his way and Sarah goes hers. Now, close to seven years later, Jon is about to marry beautiful Halley (Bridget Moynahan) and Sarah is just becoming engaged to Lars (John Corbett). Yet, Jonathan suddenly longs to find Sarah and see if what they felt for a few brief hours was real. How do you spell complications? This is a lovely film for those romantic dreamers of the world. Perhaps there is only one soulmate for each of us and, if we search long enough, he or she will be found. As the star-crossed lovers, Cusack and Beckinsale are terrific, touching and sincere. The rest of the cast, including the marvelous Jeremy Piven, the equally marvelous Eugene Levy, Moynahan, Corbett, Molly Shannon and others, is great, too. The script is imaginative and sweet while the costuming, scenery, and production values are extremely nice. If you have skipped over this one, do not let days or weeks go by before locating it at the video store. It is an excellent choice for those blustery evenings, where tea and a serendipitous movie can make the world's problems go away.

In this first film, they reluctantly team up to bring down a drug cartel run by high-level mercenaries. The plot is rather average, but what pushes this film into A-list category is the pitch-perfect chemistry between Gibson and Glover, and the dark humor throughout. Roger Murtaugh (Glover) has just turned 50, and is a few years from retirement when the death of the daughter of an old army buddy teams him up with Martin Riggs (Gibson), a burned-out, seemingly suicidal cop grieving over the recent loss of his wife. In a stand-out scene, we see Riggs, alone, ready to kill himself while looking over his wedding photo. Excellent acting, and from a buddy-cop picture! As the two cops begin to slowly earn each other's trust (after Riggs saves Murtaugh's life), the chemistry really kicks in. It's as though these guys have known each other 100 years! Gary Busey (once brilliant in THE BUDDY HOLLY STORY) is reduced to an albino thug, here. But, if it's any consolation, he's very menacing. Watching this film again after about eight years or so, it struck me how brooding and sober it was compared to the more cartoonish sequels (which are also fun in their own right). But LW 1 has a darker energy and while the humor is still there, it's just a little more sporadic. The stunt-work is amazing, but not gargantuan! Compared to how ridiculously over-the-top big-budget cop films have become lately (LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD, for example), LW 1 is the FRENCH CONNECTION! Lots of character-driven scenes (the Murtaugh family dinner scene feels improvised, as though the cameras just happened to catch it), and also some great location work (spanning a lot of Southern California; from the desert to the beach). Some not-so-PC dialogue (a nearly subliminal gay slur, and some racist bits, such as Who's the chin?) aside, the movie is a product of its time, and the writing reflects that. Warts and all. And despite a recycled, Miami Vice-rehash of a plot (right down to a neon-lit nightclub as a front), LW 1 is the most enjoyable of the '80s buddy-cop films. It's spawned three sequels (so far). And among the countless imitators, few have really captured the magic and chemistry of the lead actors (one possible exception being the first RUSH HOUR). Watching them work on DVD was almost like revisiting old friends! Not many cop films of that (or any) period give one that feeling. Lethal Weapon still shoots on the mark after 20 (!) years!

Director Tom McLoughlin...Screenplay Tom McLoughlin.Tom McLoughlin directed and wrote this little known romantic comic movie from 1987, one that is warm and magic but was overshadowed by the more A list and popular romantic comedy classics of the 80's such as the films of Molly Ringwald. Truth be told, you have to suspend disbelief in order to enjoy this film about a guy and his feelings for an angel. Despite the appearance of an angel, this film has nothing to do with Christianity nor does it contain some moral message. It's pure comedy, pure romance, fantasy and 1980's memorabilia. When aspiring music composer Jim Sanders (Michael E. Knight) is taken away from his engagement party to Patty Winston (Phoebe Cates) by his friends, he has a drunken night of recklessness and discovers an angel has fallen into his pool. The angel (the beautiful French actress Emmanuelle Beart) is mute and speaks in a weird, unknown language, attracts forest animals and has divine powers such as the ability to emanate light, become invisible and fly. But her wings are broken and she is therefore vulnerable. Jim's friends seize the opportunity to expose the angel and profit off the controversy and publicity it would trigger. Soon, Jim finds himself running from these friends, from his jealous and enraged fiancée and from the authorities. This is not a complicated story nor does it offer any philosophy or questions the meaning of life despite the fact there's an angel in the movie. Don't expect something deep when it's simply a romantic comedy from about 20 years ago. Terrific script, cinematography with a dreamy look (by Alex Thompson) and a blend of 80's music and celestial-techno from Randy Kerber. Emmanuelle Beart is beautiful and even believable as an angel. The comedy style may go over the heads of today's young audiences but if you grew up in the 80's this comedy is sure to bring back memories. Funny are moments like when the angel learns to enjoy French fries\/fast food, when the Love Beatle delivery boy does his thing and the many comic dialogues which come from almost everyone. Because of some language, because of sexual innuendo (though sex is never shown) and the fact that it's a romance about a guy who dumps a bitchy girlfriend for a hot angel, this movie should be viewed by older children and mature audiences, around the ages of 13 and up. It's not exactly a family movie as there are certain elements which classify this film as an adult romance. So take a trip back to the 80's and watch as an angel learns to love the human world.

It's a fascinating dark satire, but mostly for all the wrong reasons, with chapters of indescribably graphic sexual content and violence. If Ellis was aiming to receive a strong emotional response with his novel, then he certainly succeeded. I most definitely didn't enjoy it &#150; in fact, I felt so uncomfortably filthy that I could hardly get to sleep &#150; but he certainly knows which buttons to push. Thus, it was with some trepidation that I approached Mary Harron's 2000 film adaptation, which starred an up-and-coming Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman, a murderous psychopath who finds himself caught up in the rampant materialism of the 1980s and early 1990s. Thankfully, and I say this with the greatest relief imaginable, the intense violence of the novel was toned down considerably for its translation to the screen, and, despite some weak direction in various scenes, Christian Bale's performance is positively awesome.To look at him, you would never have guessed that Patrick Bateman was a disturbed serial killer. He is 27 years of age, handsome, intelligent, impeccably-stylish and holds a high-paying job at the respected Wall Street investment firm of Pierce & Pierce. He tries everything within his power to fit into society, but cannot suppress his distaste towards it, erupting into nightly sprees of blood-lust, during which he tortures and murders women and others who evoke his revulsion. Though we are not offered any concrete explanations for Bateman's psychosis, these acts of incredible violence appear to act as a distraction from the frustrating monotony of his 1980s yuppie lifestyle, and as a means of overcoming the intense feelings of inadequacy he harbours among his peers. Though Bateman candidly speaks of his horrific crimes on more than one occasion, the people around him are seemingly so absorbed in their chaotic, materialist lives that they hardly acknowledge his presence. In a stark indictment of American life, society is so busy comparing business cards, booking restaurant reservations, using recreational drugs and discussing fashion trivia that nobody even notices when one unhinged mad-man slaughters dozens of innocent people.Less than a decade ago, Christian Bale was pretty much an unknown, having starred in a few notable films such as Steven Spielberg's 'Empire of the Sun (1987)', but nothing that would make him a household name. After a string of actors &#150; Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio &#150; showed a passing interest in the film's main role, the opportunity fell to Bale, who delivers an absolutely extraordinary performance, portraying the infamous Patrick Bateman as cool, calm and collected character on the surface. However, to the scenes of violence, he brings a frenzied intensity to the role that is both disturbing and darkly amusing. Bateman's cocky lectures on 1980s pop music, prior to each of his killing sprees, are delivered with relish. It's perhaps a good thing that the film's director, Mary Harron, was a female, otherwise much of 'American Psycho' might easily have been misconstrued as sexist. In actual fact, the film always stops short of glorifying its gruesome protagonist, following his exploits with obvious disapproval and repulsion.Now we come to the most fascinating question posed by the film how much of what Bateman does may we accept as reality? In the novel, Bret Easton Ellis cleverly keeps the answer to this completely ambiguous, offering scattered hints that support each of the possibilities. In media interviews, director Mary Harron has stated that she had always intended for Bateman's murders to be completely real, though I think that this is where her direction was a bit weak; I'll wager that almost everybody who hasn't read the book finished the film with the belief that Bateman had imagined all the killings. The final scene, in which Harold Carnes (Stephen Bogaert) claims to have recently had dinner with one of Bateman's victims, Paul Allen (Jared Leto), was handled quite well, since we already know that, throughout the film, it is commonplace for characters to mistake each other for somebody else indeed, at the start of that very conversation, Carnes refers to Bateman as Davis. The scene of which I am not quite so enthusiastic is Bateman's revisit to Paul Allen's residence, where he finds a perfectly-clean apartment and a real estate agent.

SPOILERS ENSUE!*At first I did not want to see this movie, because I had seen many a movie that butchered a favorite cartoon of mine for one thing, and the whole PG-13 rating kind of turned me off. But curiosity got the better of me, and I ran across it one night on some premium movie channel or another while I was channel surfing.I wish I had kept on channel surfing that night.Though I do admit, there were some things of the movie I liked. Four of the songs, and some parts WERE funny-Alexandra being asked why she's there, and her responding with because I was in the comic book. (I love jokes like this!)-The band meeting in the Starbucks ladies room. I *loved* how Val got Alex out of there. Anybody have change for a tampon? I'll be outside. (something like that. That's one way of getting a guy out of the girl's room!)I thought the idea was good, though. Putting subliminal messages into music to sell not only the music, but products as well (orange is the new pink!) I told my sister, as a joke, Hey! Now we know why all those Boy Bands are so popular! (my sister and I were in our teens during the whole Boy Band craze, but we never really followed the crowds on them. To this day, I still don't like Boy Band music). Actually, this movie inspired me to write a story, but that's beside the point.Now, for what I hated about the movieThe Language. I'm one of those weird people who can not stand swearing. I can take it in small doses, but usually, comedies rated PG-13 have swear words coming out the wazoo. I also hated all those sexual innuendos. It's like nobody can make a movie these days that does not have sex jokes somewhere in it.Melody got kind of annoying fast. Sure, she was a dumb blonde in the cartoon, but in this movie, she was a complete airhead. She wasn't this stupid in the cartoon series (can you tell I like the cartoon a lot better than this movie?) Valerie also had an attitude problem that I couldn't really picture her having. What did they do that for? To make her more interesting? And Josie was . . . . . well, just Josie.You could not take one single look at anything in this movie without seeing a product placement. Yes, I realize it was a parody. Yes, I realize you can't take this movie seriously. But it was a 90 minute commercial.Sebastian! What happened to Sebastian?! You remember Sebastian, don't you? Alexandra's pet cat? The band's mascot with the Muttley-esquire snicker? The one who got Josie and the gang out of the messes they got themselves into in the cartoon? How can you have the Pussycats, without their black and white snickering Pussycat mascot?! What, they couldn't find a black cat with white feet to be Sebastian? Or was a computer generated Sebastian (complete with snicker) just not in the budget? Either way, this ticked me off big time!Alan, Alex, and Alexandra. What happened to them? I hated the way Alan was portrayed, a shy, dumb blonde. I can't see that from Alan. They did not cast him very well, either. He needed to be more muscular. And what was with Alan M? I know that was in the original comic, and I have to ask what was with that there, too. But that didn't bother me much. I never really cared for Alan, anyway.Alex and Alexandra, on the other hand, is a different story. They were barely in this movie, and that ticked me off because Alex and Alexandra (and Sebastian the cat for that matter) are my favorite characters in the cartoon. Actually, I think the only character in this movie that was true to form was Alexandra, little screen time that she had. I think she was the only character that was actually IN character!I absolutely hated when Fiona and Wyatt tried to turn Josie against Valerie and Melody. That really bugged me. I don't know why it bugged me, but it just bugged me. Was that trip really necessary? I never liked the Best Friend Turns on Best Friend angle (I guess it's because it reminds me of my high school years).In defense of the plot, it was an interesting idea, but I felt it was poorly executed.

Four of the songs, and some parts WERE funny-Alexandra being asked why she's there, and her responding with because I was in the comic book. (I love jokes like this!)-The band meeting in the Starbucks ladies room. I *loved* how Val got Alex out of there. Anybody have change for a tampon? I'll be outside. (something like that. That's one way of getting a guy out of the girl's room!)I thought the idea was good, though. Putting subliminal messages into music to sell not only the music, but products as well (orange is the new pink!) I told my sister, as a joke, Hey! Now we know why all those Boy Bands are so popular! (my sister and I were in our teens during the whole Boy Band craze, but we never really followed the crowds on them. To this day, I still don't like Boy Band music). Actually, this movie inspired me to write a story, but that's beside the point.Now, for what I hated about the movieThe Language. I'm one of those weird people who can not stand swearing. I can take it in small doses, but usually, comedies rated PG-13 have swear words coming out the wazoo. I also hated all those sexual innuendos. It's like nobody can make a movie these days that does not have sex jokes somewhere in it.Melody got kind of annoying fast. Sure, she was a dumb blonde in the cartoon, but in this movie, she was a complete airhead. She wasn't this stupid in the cartoon series (can you tell I like the cartoon a lot better than this movie?) Valerie also had an attitude problem that I couldn't really picture her having. What did they do that for? To make her more interesting? And Josie was . . . . . well, just Josie.You could not take one single look at anything in this movie without seeing a product placement. Yes, I realize it was a parody. Yes, I realize you can't take this movie seriously. But it was a 90 minute commercial.Sebastian! What happened to Sebastian?! You remember Sebastian, don't you? Alexandra's pet cat? The band's mascot with the Muttley-esquire snicker? The one who got Josie and the gang out of the messes they got themselves into in the cartoon? How can you have the Pussycats, without their black and white snickering Pussycat mascot?! What, they couldn't find a black cat with white feet to be Sebastian? Or was a computer generated Sebastian (complete with snicker) just not in the budget? Either way, this ticked me off big time!Alan, Alex, and Alexandra. What happened to them? I hated the way Alan was portrayed, a shy, dumb blonde. I can't see that from Alan. They did not cast him very well, either. He needed to be more muscular. And what was with Alan M? I know that was in the original comic, and I have to ask what was with that there, too. But that didn't bother me much. I never really cared for Alan, anyway.Alex and Alexandra, on the other hand, is a different story. They were barely in this movie, and that ticked me off because Alex and Alexandra (and Sebastian the cat for that matter) are my favorite characters in the cartoon. Actually, I think the only character in this movie that was true to form was Alexandra, little screen time that she had. I think she was the only character that was actually IN character!I absolutely hated when Fiona and Wyatt tried to turn Josie against Valerie and Melody. That really bugged me. I don't know why it bugged me, but it just bugged me. Was that trip really necessary? I never liked the Best Friend Turns on Best Friend angle (I guess it's because it reminds me of my high school years).In defense of the plot, it was an interesting idea, but I felt it was poorly executed.

Like Stephen King, he larded his pages with references to consumer products and familiar names. In the novel Victoria Gionoffrio looked exactly like Audrey Hepburn, not some fictional actress.Here, Levin has written an almost perfect woman-in-jeopardy film that, had it not had the performers, director, and production values of a feature film, would have fit neatly into the sort of template that leaps out at a view from an LMN movie. Where's my BABY?, Rosemary Woodhouse screams towards the end.Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and husband Guy (John Cassavetes), an upwardly mobile young couple in New York, rent an apartment in a building haunted by its violent and mysterious past. Guy is an actor, limited to unimportant roles, until his rival for an important part is suddenly struck blind and Guy gets the part he's been praying for. His turn of fortune may have had something to do with their somewhat odd but unpretentious neighbors, especially the Castavets, Sidney Blackmer and the amusingly dotty Ruth Gordon. In fact, as it develops, his good luck owed everything to them. Cassavetes has achieved his goal by selling his wife as a vehicle for the conception, gestation, and birth of the child of Satan. The pregnancy is really bizarre too, involving magic potions prepared by Gordon, and the conniving of a celebrity Ob-Gyn doc (Ralph Bellamy) who is in on the plot.Mia Farrow gradually twigs to the plan and tries to escape, but her every attempt is blocked. We want things to turn out well for her and her baby, of course, but, as is usual with Roman Polanski, the ending is sad. More than sad, actually. The son of Satan is born and will lay waste to the world! shouts an ecstatic Blackmer. Right. The formula calls for a perceptive young man who is a friend, hopelessly in love with Farrow, to catch on and come to her rescue at the last minute, sort of like Hutch (Maurice Evans), but it doesn't happen here.The movie is about as well done as these horror fantasies get. All of the principle actors are splendid. And nobody could have embodied the threatened mother-to-be better than the waif-like Mia Farrow. She's skinny and beautiful to begin with. But as her pregnancy progresses and she suffers severe and continuous pain, and after she has a prison haircut, and after she loses still more weight, she becomes positively hebemorphic and afflicted with raccoon eyes. The fetus may be flourishing but she looks as if she's about to waste away to nothing.

No one with more hideous outfits than Ruth Gordon's has been on the screen for a generation before and after the release of this movie. I guess there is one weak scene. In desperation, Farrow visits her original obstetrician (Charles Grodin) and tells him about her entrapment.

He is on the run from his latest (unexplained) adventures when he finds himself in the small Texas town of Jericho. The town, not really much of a town, is plagued by two warring gangs. Smith sees the situation as an opportunity to make some quick cash by playing both sides against each other. However, as the story unfolds we find Smith to be caught in a conflict of his own warped sense of honor and conscience (which of course is profoundly ironic since Smith claims to be without a conscience).The movie is solid but nothing special. It is well acted, Bruce Willis as the lead character John Smith is superb and Christopher Walken is, as always, superb as the Irish mobs number one shooter. The two lead female characters in the film play a major part in the development of the story despite not having large roles.Overall Last Man Standing is a fantastic movie, but not in the sense that it's a good movie but the sense that it is quite unrealistic. Regardless it is very entertaining and a great movie to watch when you don't want to put much thought into the movie. It is a guy movie though, meaning it is rather violent (though not graphically so) and contains a fair amount of female nudity and sexual content (again not graphically so).My final recommendation is sit down with a bag of popcorn and enjoy watching Bruce Willis kick some bad guy butt.

The two lead female characters in the film play a major part in the development of the story despite not having large roles.Overall Last Man Standing is a fantastic movie, but not in the sense that it's a good movie but the sense that it is quite unrealistic. Regardless it is very entertaining and a great movie to watch when you don't want to put much thought into the movie. It is a guy movie though, meaning it is rather violent (though not graphically so) and contains a fair amount of female nudity and sexual content (again not graphically so).My final recommendation is sit down with a bag of popcorn and enjoy watching Bruce Willis kick some bad guy butt.

I don't like Cameron Diaz in most roles, but this was her best one by far. She is very good as a woman owner of a football team trying very hard to do it as a woman. In addition, at times the football action was entertaining. It is the off-field dramas that mar the film substantially.First of all, it was a professional football team. In the real world of pro football, the quarterback doesn't puke on the field. There are fans watching the game. James Wood's role was largely comical and irrelevant. Since pro football is a multi-billion dollar business, amoral doctors are not going to be hired or tolerated. It was also almost playoffs. As bad as the sport's world seems, players don't party openly, do drugs, and hire prostitutes right before the playoffs. Even the most irresponsible football players are not that dumb, because at that point of the season they wouldn't want the entire team and city hating them. The coach of a football team would be planning plays after the game, not drinking at bars and being propositioned by prostitutes. A coach wouldn't openly scowl, when his quarterback deviates from the play slightly, if it results in a win. Pro football coaches are celebrities, and wouldn't scowl when their team won as a result of a player being independent minded. The coach may after the game in the locker room remind the quarterback that there is a game plan. That was another major wrong with this film. There was only a play called in the last few seconds of the final regular season game. Pro football is all about plays. All the coach did was give pep talks.So, the film was basically ruined by unrealistic, exaggerated scenarios. Stone should have spent more time studying the real game of football, instead of some Hollywood interpretation. The acting was good, and at times there was an attempt to show that football is a very rough sport. However, I can not really recommend this film, other than being slightly entertaining, and possessing a good cast of actors.
