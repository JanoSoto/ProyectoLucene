The evil SPECTRE organization has stolen two atomic bombs from a jet bomber and will be deployed unless they are paid a heaping sum of one hundred million dollars. Bond heads to the Bahamas to find the bombs, defeat the bad guys, and of course make time to get the ladies. The story is actually kind of dark and more serious than some of the previous films with some interesting plot points that seem to reflect the Cold War paranoia of the time, even the overall tone and atmosphere of the film tends to be dark, which makes this another one of my favorites in the series. The violence is sometimes wrenching though seldom graphic and the sexual overtones are quite blatant, though I think we're used to that by now. Sean Connery portrays James Bond for the fourth time and has all the confidence and charm that makes him such a joy to watch in the previous installments, he may even be getting bored at this point with mostly having to swim, fight and be a womanizer, but he does a fantastic job anyways, his chemistry with the other characters always work perfectly. Also, we see that sometimes even he needs a little help from time to time and makes a few mistakes from time to time. This is a great entry in the series, but I guess there are a few minor flaws. First of all, it seems to move just a little slowly at times. One of the things people really complain about is all the gadgets, yes there are a lot of gadgets, but I don't mind. I love the opening where Bond makes an escape with a jet pack, now that's just classic.The other characters are just wonderful, Adolfo Celi is great in the role of Italian Emilio Largo, the main villain of the film. This guy is just brutal and cold hearted, never reluctant to kill one of his own henchmen, he is even willing to torture his mistress when he discovers her betrayal. He just looks and acts like such a stereotypical villain, a dark heavyset man with short white hair, a menacing voice, he even has an eye-patch to complete the villainous ensemble. The villainess of the film is the seductive Fiona Volpe played by Luciana Paluzzi. She's a great femme fatale if I ever saw one, during a brief chase scene she saves Bond from from one of her fellow villains, she also seems to enjoy seducing her victims before having them killed. The main Bond girl however is the lovely Domino Derval played by Claudine Auger. I have to admit that she really brings warmth and humanity to an otherwise harsh assortment of characters, she is Largo's mistress unaware that he is preparing to launch a possible nuclear Armageddon and he has had her brother killed in their plot to take over the world. Still, she is a strong character and her performance is very good. Felix Leiter also returns, this time portrayed by Rik Van Nutter. Fortunately we get appearances by series regulars Moneypenny, M and Q, who provides Bond with his many awesome gadgets.One of the things I love is that the action takes place in the Bahamas, I love when Bond's adventures take him to exotic tropical locations and it gives us the opportunity to enjoy some great underwater sequences. The action scenes are also a real treat to watch, including the spectacular underwater battle during the climax, which I still consider to be one of the best I've ever seen. The cinematography and special effects are definitely noteworthy for the time, everything is sleek and realistic and puts you in the right mood. The same thing goes for the music, John Barry returns for the fourth time providing us with the tunes of the title song and the traditional theme music, the music score itself ranges from dark and brooding to upbeat and exciting and even romantic. In regards to the title song, it's great Tom Jones singing to an outstanding music score accompanied by the silhouettes of girls swimming with psychedelic colors in the background, I've always enjoyed that particular title sequence, sleek, surreal and sexy. Maybe the one problem with the movie that people seem to notice is that it definitely goes for being a straight up action thriller, the plot of atomic bombs being stolen is simple enough, the constant use of gadgets and weapons while simple hand-to-hand combat takes a bit of a backseat. No surprise, seeing this was the most expensive Bond film yet and the producers being well aware of how big a moneymaker the series was. However there are very many who really enjoy this film and I'm one of them, it's still one of the most solid and enjoyable entries in the series and ultimately satisfying.

I was having a fit of cinematic malaise...there simply were not a whole heck of a lot of good flicks coming out during that time, and the slew of street thug movies actually made it somewhat dangerous to venture out into theaters in some cities. A lot of us said to hell with it and decided to concentrate on our own VHS collections and catch up on films when they became available for rent or purchase. Consequently, I did not see Goodfellas until 1999. I'd heard about the film, and I must say my own legs were not long enough to kick myself in the rear for waiting so long to see it. And this was just one of the films I had to catch up with...there were a number of others. I did not think that this film could top most of the other mob-type films that had already been made. I was wrong. The film was engrossing form the outset. Joe Pesci was loud and scary...and Paul Sorvino was relatively quiet and scary...in a way that was more menacing and perhaps more disturbing than Pesci...which was acting that took quite a bit of doing. I was rather roughed up at some of the language and the racial references...it took me a while to reconcile this...they were products of the times. One thing that caught my eye--and ear--was that Scorsese kept the imagery in a kind of 1960s mode. No long sideburns or long haircuts. No dog-eared shirts...no wide neck-ties or lapels. This hurt the film from a standpoint of making it flow with time...but the performances and the characters help to overcome this.The story is very well told, and Scorsese does it masterfully. One can see that he had a direct influence on Tarantino, especially when the film opens with the murder of a made man in the mob...a story that we return to much later in the film. Tarantino borrowed that style and essentially made it his own. Pesci re-defined the definition of a madman in a screen performance of a character who did not live to the end of the film...but yet will not die. Sorvinos broad range has seen him playing such diverse characters as Bible-thumping fundamentalist ministers...even a rape victim. But his stature as a tough guy is secure...one glance from those steely eyes can penetrate the audience, and you can see Perdition itself through it all. Bob De Niro plays, of all things, a character who is only half-Italian, which would dis-qualify him from becoming a made man for the mob no matter what he does. His, too, is a very broad spectrum. I have a few reservations about recommending the film 100%. It is very realistic, very graphic and very violent. But, seldom is the truth a very pretty thing to look at. See Goodfellas...if you haven;t already. If you have...see it again. It is part of my collection now.

And this was just one of the films I had to catch up with...there were a number of others. I did not think that this film could top most of the other mob-type films that had already been made. I was wrong. The film was engrossing form the outset. Joe Pesci was loud and scary...and Paul Sorvino was relatively quiet and scary...in a way that was more menacing and perhaps more disturbing than Pesci...which was acting that took quite a bit of doing. I was rather roughed up at some of the language and the racial references...it took me a while to reconcile this...they were products of the times. One thing that caught my eye--and ear--was that Scorsese kept the imagery in a kind of 1960s mode. No long sideburns or long haircuts. No dog-eared shirts...no wide neck-ties or lapels. This hurt the film from a standpoint of making it flow with time...but the performances and the characters help to overcome this.The story is very well told, and Scorsese does it masterfully. One can see that he had a direct influence on Tarantino, especially when the film opens with the murder of a made man in the mob...a story that we return to much later in the film. Tarantino borrowed that style and essentially made it his own. Pesci re-defined the definition of a madman in a screen performance of a character who did not live to the end of the film...but yet will not die. Sorvinos broad range has seen him playing such diverse characters as Bible-thumping fundamentalist ministers...even a rape victim. But his stature as a tough guy is secure...one glance from those steely eyes can penetrate the audience, and you can see Perdition itself through it all. Bob De Niro plays, of all things, a character who is only half-Italian, which would dis-qualify him from becoming a made man for the mob no matter what he does. His, too, is a very broad spectrum. I have a few reservations about recommending the film 100%. It is very realistic, very graphic and very violent. But, seldom is the truth a very pretty thing to look at. See Goodfellas...if you haven;t already. If you have...see it again. It is part of my collection now.

It's so well-made that it's always a pleasure to watch. The script is one of the best Hollywood scripts ever and is filled with unforgettable characters, dialogue and action scenes.According to the Mayor of San Francisco (the great John Vernon), there's a madman loose. The madman in question is a serial killer called Scorpio (he is also a paedophile, a rapist, a thief and an extortionist). Enter his opponent - unconventional cop Inspector Harry Callahan. From the start it's clear that Harry does things his way and resents authority, but he's a good cop and is let loose to hunt down Scorpio.It's in the conflict between Harry and Scorpio that the movie really comes into its own. They are equals in many ways, both are expert marksmen, both are control freaks and both enjoy sadistic games (Harry taunts suspects to go for their gun if they think he's out of bullets, a kind of variation on Russian Roulette. Scorpio kidnaps and buries a young girl and he runs Harry from one phone booth to another, if Harry misses one call, she dies. It turns out she was dead all along and Harry was wasting his time.) It could also be argued that Harry is as crazy as Scorpio, just look at his face when he steps on Scorpio's wounded leg in the football stadium to get him to confess the buried girl's whereabouts. Yet they are different in that they are on opposite sides of the law.Like Buffalo Bill in The Silence of the Lambs, Scorpio is a fictionalized version of a real killer. The Zodiac Killer terrorized Northern California in the late 60s and was still at large when this movie came out (he has never been caught to this day). In one of his infamous taunting letters to the press, he claimed he would shoot a bus full of children. Although Zodiac never carried out that threat, Scorpio makes good on it in this movie by hijacking a school bus with children on board (while Scorpio never kills any of them, he has already killed a young black boy and raped and killed a young girl earlier in the film, so it's quite possible he could have harmed the kids had Harry not intervened).Andy Robinson has a field day playing Scorpio and he never really got a role that good again and it's a pity. Clint Eastwood suggested him to Don Siegel after seeing him in a stage play.John Wayne and Frank Sinatra were once in the running to play Harry Callahan - Wayne passed, Sinatra injured his hand. Thank God for that, Clint Eastwood was never better than in this and the role of Harry fits him like a glove (if you want to see what Wayne and Sinatra would have been like, check out McQ and The First Deadly Sin respectively.)The running gag throughout the movie is the reason why Callahan is called Dirty Harry. Another cop gives his theory that it's because Harry hates everybody and goes on to list all the racial slurs for those types of people. Harry himself, after stopping a suicidal jumper, explains that he's Dirty Harry because he gets every sh*t job that comes along. Another possible explanation for Harry's nickname comes in two scenes where he voyeuristically spies on naked girls while tracking Scorpio (this voyeurism is another way he is like Scorpio, the movie begins with Scorpio watching a girl swimming in a rooftop pool through a telescopic sight and Harry even follows Scorpio to a strip joint later on).There is a fascinating example of how primitive criminal profiling was back in 1971. The chief of police makes a throwaway comment about how sick guys rob the same place many times. Today, forensics and profilers would be all over this case from the first murder and Harry's old-fashioned leg work would take a back seat.The subtext of Dirty Harry is really about the beginnings of Political Correctness and how old school cop Harry is unable and unwilling to conform to it. Harry would have begun his career as a cop when police brutality and racism were the norm and confessions were routinely beaten out of suspects. He gets a rude awakening when he tries that heavy-handed tactic on Scorpio and is berated by his superiors for it. It's clearly a shock for him; the other shock is that Scorpio goes free because Harry never got a warrant even though the dogs in the street know he's guilty as hell. It leads to the famous finale in which Harry, having cut through the bureaucracy and killed Scorpio, realizes he can no longer function as a cop in the system and throws his badge into the water. Box office success would dictate that Harry would get a replacement badge for four sequels. None of those movies could touch the original Dirty Harry (although the first half hour of Sudden Impact came close to matching it and gave us that other classic Harry line Go ahead, make my day.). Dirty Harry remains an all-time classic nearly 40 years after its release and it remains my favorite Clint Eastwood movie and his best collaboration with director Don Siegel.

This meant that each movie has its own distinct personality, while sharing a single core idea. With Army of Darkness, Raimi produced the most commercial entry in the series and played down the horror element in favour of fantasy battles and humour. The latter is mainly provided, of course, by Bruce Campbell. He is such an important part of this movie that it is inconceivable to imagine him not in it. Similar to his turn in Evil Dead 2, Campbell puts in a comic acting master-class. His brand of hammy acting and physical knock-about humour really has to be seen to be believed. Campbell's considerable cult reputation is hugely based on his performances in these two films; he is quite simply a revelation. Of course, Sam Raimi has to be credited too, as his kinetic style of direction is a perfect match for Campbell's over-the-top style of comic acting. Raimi remains one of the few directors who has consistently found a way of combining comedy and horror effectively.

There where no negatives about this film. I'm just giving everyone advice about the remake. Watch it once, and then never ever watch it again because it is full of crap. The remake has no original ideas and it just copies straight out of the Original, though with no suspense.I think this is a great horror movie and also it's a lovely display and probably Hitchcock's best film made. This film is also a good one to watch over and over again because when Alfred Hitchcock created this film, it started the Slasher Genere off really well.

Actually I'm coming back to the subject having watched 1994's Wyatt EarpReturn to Tombstone last week, which in turn caused me to do some more reading and research on the topic. Both movies actually get a lot of the history of the Earp Brothers down pretty accurately, right down to some of the nuances that led to the famous gunfight. Like Wyatt Earp bumping into Tom McLaury coming out of The Oriental, and cold cocking him to provoke a confrontation. There were a lot of those historical tidbits sprinkled throughout the story, so that if you learned about them ahead of time, you would be even more intrigued by the film.That wasn't the case the first time I saw this picture when it came out in 1993. Back then, this was purely escapist entertainment, and the story of the OK Corral was just another fuzzy piece of Western history. But watching today, there's a lot about that period of the early 1880's that comes into focus under director George Cosmatos' discerning eye. If you're a Wyatt Earp fan, (and I am), and watch the picture from a completely neutral perspective, it becomes pretty evident that the Earp Brothers formed their own version of a protection racket once they got a foothold in Tombstone. With no more than a blistering confrontation with Ed Bailey (Frank Stallone) - You gonna do somethin' or just stand there and bleed? - Wyatt picks up a quarter interest in the Oriental. That kind of intimidation gained the Earps a reputation that quickly earned them a financial stake in virtually all the gambling and prostitution the town had to offer.On the opposite side of course were the Cowboys. The opening narration to the picture might have gone a bit overboard with their description as the first instance of organized crime in the country. Actually, the Cowboys depended on a rather loose association based on business interests and family affiliation, along with personal friendships. In 1881, the Clantons were rather large landowners who derived much of their income from cattle rustling. The citizens of Tombstone were somewhat divided in their opinion of the Earps and the Cowboys, because even though they were a rowdy bunch, the Cowboys spent their money freely throughout the town. It wasn't surprising then, that elements would seek revenge on the Earps after the gunfight and trial.But enough of the history. One of the things that I had forgotten all about was the opening sequence with Curly Bill (Powers Boothe) and Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn). Eight years earlier, Clint Eastwood built a movie narrative around Revelations 6, Verse 8 in Pale Rider - And I looked, and behold a pale horse. And his name that sat on his back was Death, and Hell followed with him. I'm somewhat surprised the picture used virtually the same theme to kick off this picture. Johnny Ringo goes on to effect his own demonic influence throughout the story, but I wonder now whether it's more intriguing to consider Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday as the real pale rider of the story. Racked by tuberculosis, Kilmer gradually transforms his character into a deathlike spectre who faces Ringo in a final throw down that was pre-ordained. But I have to say, their initial meeting in The Oriental ranks right up there as one of the most memorable scenes in movie Westerns. Kilmer's cup twirl was an inspired piece of writing and acting brilliance.As for the fabled gunfight, the story gets it right once again (for the most part). The McLaury's and Billy Clanton died, Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne ran off, while Morgan and Virgil Earp were severely wounded. Doc Holliday took a bullet to the hip, and Wyatt came away unscathed. I counted over fifty rounds fired in the picture against history's account of roughly thirty one shots fired, nevertheless, it was all over pretty quickly.Dispensing with the Spicer trial that found Wyatt and Doc cleared of murder charges, the events that follow wind up economically compressed for time. With Virgil (Sam Elliott) once again severely shot and wounded, and Morgan (Bill Paxton) murdered, Wyatt and Doc embark on a lesser known facet of Tombstone history, the Earp Vendetta Ride. With a loyal group of followers, Wyatt and Doc sought revenge on those they considered responsible for the attacks on the Earps. Historically, Johnny Ringo met his demise during this period, though the circumstances of his death is open to wide speculation, one of which is the version offered here.Although they maintained contact following the vendetta ride, Wyatt and Doc Holliday basically went their separate ways, so the scene at the Glenwood Springs Sanatorium is the film's final attempt to elicit some genuine emotion from the players and the viewer. I'll let them get away with that, as every film takes some license with history. It's the picture's last chance to put the Wyatt Earp\/Doc Holliday relationship into perspective, as reflecting on Doc's words earlier in the film states it best - Wyatt Earp is my friend.

You'd have some sense of artistic credibility or at least dignity, and you'd only do something like that in service of a worthwhile story, right? Sadly, that's not right. Battle for the Planet of the Apes is a genuinely horrible film and everyone in it, from John Huston on down, had to embarrassed to be part of it. Let me put this clearly. The fifth Planet of the Apes movie is so bad, it makes Rocky V look like The Empire Strikes Back on the quality sequel scale. While watching it, I desperately wished to be sitting in the Satellite of Love with two smart-ass robots beside me.It's almost too depressing to tell you the plot of the film, because there barely is one. Caesar (Roddy McDowell), who led the ape rebellion in Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, and a group of apes and humans somehow survived an atomic war and have created Ape City. Caesar is told by a human he can find information about his parents and the destiny of Earth in the bombed out Forbidden City. They go there, get ambushed by the radiation-ravaged ancestors of the Mutants from Beneath the Planet of the Apes, and flee back to Ape City. The mutated humans launch an attack on Ape City and&#x85;ugh. I can't go on. It's so stupid. Ape City? This is a comic book movie, both in the classic sense of being poorly and shallowly written and in the modern sense in that it solely exists in service of Planet of the Apes continuity. There's really no point or issue of the human condition being explored here. Somebody in the studio just decided they wanted one final Ape movie for theaters and didn't give a damn how much it sucked. The writing is pathetic. The acting is almost uniformly bad, including an astonishing poor performance by the mutant human leader (Severn Darden). He emotes like he was playing the fussy country club director from some forgotten Caddyshack rip-off. And the sets and the make up and the costumes look like they were purchased with the change scrounged out from between the cushions of some producer's casting couch.But even in this disgusting, hail-belching cloud of a movie, there is something to be learned. Being an actor, at its root, is a soul crushing existence. Not only does John Huston put on an ape suit for this piece of crap, but Roddy McDowell has to suffer through the entire film. I don't know how much he got paid but it couldn't have been enough. The original Planet of the Apes is a great movie. Beneath and Escape are very good and even Conquest is okay, if really over the top. McDowell was in those movies. He had to have remembered how good they were and he had to have known how atrocious this was one even while he was filming it. How would you like to do something, something of quality, something people loved, and then seen that something reduced to garbage. And then you're paid to role around in that garbage. This movie reminds me of how happy I was that Jodie Foster didn't star in Hannibal, the sequel to The Silence of the Lambs. It makes it so much easier to forget about the awful sequel and just cherish the wonderful first movie.There is one more interesting thing about Battle for the Planet of the Apes. It's G rated. There's shooting and explosions and people get killed, including an ape child, but it gets the same rating as Disney cartoon. I'm not sure if that says something about how warped our present standards of family friendly material have become, or if it says the people of the early 1970s were so stupid that they thought dressing people up like Apes automatically made it a kiddie flick.To sum up, this is an awesomely bad movie.

If you turned it into a drinking game and took a shot every time there was a bad line of dialog or an actor resembled a block of wood or you saw a set that looked like something a vagrant child might build in your backyard or witnessed an ape mask actually worse than the ones kids used to wear for Halloween&#x85;you'd be dead of alcohol poisoning within 30 minutes.

All the fire of his blazing courage and outrage are blended in this incredible portrayal of the dilemma of modern Burma. There is probably no military dictatorship anywhere in the world more brutal than that of Burma, which surpasses even the unlamented tyranny of Saddam Hussein for cruelty and sheer evil. It was like that when this film was made, and it is still like that now, 16 years later. Nothing has changed except that Aung San Suu Kyi is 16 years older. She is played delicately and to perfection in this film, in a brief and moving scene where she gracefully walks up to soldiers pointing rifles at her, brushes them aside, and passes on. In a sense, she is not just the Conscience of Burma but the current Conscience of the World. For she remains faithful to a cause which the world has heartlessly abandoned. Because there is no oil in Burma, it will not be invaded by the United States, Tony Blair will not go there with his pious platitudes and grin of a madman, BP will not ruin the coastline, and the arms industry must be content merely with selling guns for the population and 'rebels' to be murdered, not for invading troops to be opposed (what a pity there is less need for tanks and fighter planes, not to mention drones). Why is it that the Burmese population are so thoughtless that they allow themselves to be shot with simple rifle bullets, so that cannon shells are not required? The Burmese military really are bad customers, they kill on the cheap. But of course, like the Nazis, they get plenty of raping and torture in first, as what fun is it being a vicious brute if you cannot lord it over the people you are about to massacre before you do so? Even a Burmese soldier has his vanity. The most amazing performance in this film is by a Burmese man whose own name is the same as that of the character he plays, U Aung Ko. This is the only film in which he ever appeared, according to IMDb, so he was not an actor but 'a real person'. (Note do real persons exist on screen outside of documentaries? This is an existential question for cinéastes.) In trying to find out more about this man, I googled the name and discovered that there is another U Aung Ko, actually U Aung Ko Win, also known as Saya Kyaung, who is closely connected with the present sinister regime, probably a relative but certainly not the same man as our hero in the film. Then I discovered that our hero lives in exile in Paris, having left Burma to live in France in 1975 (where he had previously studied at the Sorbonne), where he is married to a French woman, has assisted in the preparation of a documentary film about his country's plight, and works as a translator and language teacher. So that's who he is. The other lead in the film is Patricia Arquette, who gives a magnificently stalwart and powerful performance and clearly endured a great deal of physical hardship in doing so. The two of them work very well together and generate significant chemistry (not of the romantic kind but of the rarer kind based on understanding and friendship), which helps make the film such a spectacular success. Frances McDormand appears early in the film as Arquette's sister who has to leave her behind because she is forced to leave Burma with a tour group while Arquette is stranded while she waits for travel papers from the incompetent US Embassy. McDormand is, as usual, wonderful, but then she is one of our most admired actresses, who never disappoints. Arquette has been widowed and is recovering from intense grief, and as a result of her amazing adventures which ensue 'beyond Rangoon' when she gets out into the countryside (officially barred to foreigners), she finds a new meaning and value to life in helping others. Several of her companions are killed along the way. There are many excellent performances from young Burmese, or actors who play Burmese, since obviously this film could not be made in Burma (it was filmed in Malaysia and Thailand) and several of the players are really of diverse ethnic backgrounds. We see many horrible massacres and rampant violence and oppression taking place continually. Unfortunately, though many films with an axe to grind have tended to show these things for tendentious purposes, in this case I fear it is all too true. It does not appear that one can exaggerate on film any of the atrocities committed either by the Nazis of Germany or the Burmese military of today. This film really should be shown in schools. It is such a powerful lesson about the real world, so inspiring and horrifying at the same time. And yet those same parents who are content to let their kids sit around all day watching meaningless blood and gore on the screen with fictitious 'action heroes', and play computer games where everybody gets rewarded for killing other people (is that sick or what?), would doubtless complain because there are many grim real life situations portrayed here. Such is the 'hypocrisy of suburbia' into which real life rarely enters. We should all be giving copies of this film to all of our friends. And if the politicians were not all such thickos, they might even do something about the West's foreign policy.

It was also a period where the buddy cop genre growth with 48 Hours and the Beverly Hills Cop Series. Sequels too were becoming more popular, such as the Back to the Future trilogy, Mad Max series, the Karate Kid series and Indiana Jones trilogy being major examples. With Lethal Weapon being a hit in 1987 a sequel was commissioned, with Richard Donner, Mel Gibson, Danny Glover and Shane Black returning.Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) are now friends and partners in the LAPD. There are on the case of foreign drug dealers importing heroin into the United States. But when Murtaugh and his wife are threaten their captain assign the two officers to protect Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), a loudmouth money launderer who has become a federal witness. Getz is targeted by the drug dealers Riggs and Murtaugh are thrust into action to arrest them. But there are South African diplomats lead by Arjen Rudd (Joss Ackland). There are protected by diplomatic immunity so our heroes have to come up with other means to stop the cartel.With the characters established in the first film, Donner was able to jump into the action straight and what better way is then a car chase in the middle of Los Andreas. Lethal Weapon 2 was also able to streamline the plot, forcing mostly on the battle of minds and weapons with the South Africans. There are not as many subplots, but the ones that are in the film do work. Donner keeps Lethal Weapon 2 going at a face pace, with plenty of action and tone wise the sequel is more light hearted and overtly humorous to it's predecessor. Most of the humour works, like when Murtaugh goes to the South African consulate pretended he wanted to emigrate to the Apartheid nation. There is also a running joke about Murtaugh's wife's new car repeatedly getting damaged because of the police wok. But there are a few scenes which try to be funny but do not add anything to the film, like when the cops and Getz argue about going through a drive through. Donner continues using traditional techniques for the action sequences, using stunt work and keeping the action real. It is also so good to actually see what is going on during a shoot-out or fight. The final fight scene between Gibson and Derrick O'Connor was better in this film then it was in Lethal Weapon because Donner used a lot of wide shots and used less cuts in the fight. Donner and his writers also find some interesting ways to kill people in rather humorous ways.Acting wise Lethal Weapon 2 was alright, Gibson and Glover has good chemistry together and now much more light hearted. Most of the other actors did a decent job, but Pesci's character was very annoying and he works best with Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro. Some of the actors playing South Africans were also not able to master the accent, sounding more Australian\/New Zealander, but that's a minor problem.However, a minor plothole in the film is if South African security forces started to kill American cops then you could imagine the response of the American government would have been.I found it very ironic that Gibson made fun of the South Africans for thinking there are the master race and calling one of them Adolf, considering we all now know his views on Black and Jewish people, women and homosexuals.A fun film.

For what reason? To depress the price of them? Or to blackmail governments? Bond has to find out.Exotic locations Holland, Las Vegas (U.S.A).This has to be one of the slenderist justifications to utilise James Bond on a mission. Of course, the decision to use Bond on this mission will be justified, eventually, but really it seems as if the producers had the theme song first and decided to make a movie having something to do with diamonds...just so that they could use the song!Annoyingly, at this point the franchise knows that this spy is a cultural phenomenon, and they really play up to that. His charisma is taken for granted...and even abused...he gets to deliver one liners on a par with that Las Vegas casino comedian he sees (in this movie). Having Bond be a celebrity spy now is a bit of a low point for the franchise...a spy whose reputation precedes them? Is that advisable in the spying business?Sadly, this movie seems to pretend that the last instalment - On her majesty's secret service - never happened. Sad because not only is it not fit to polish that movie's shoes (!), it is also a rather disappointing effort by Connery's own standards.Bond formula Pre-title sequence Desperately seeking Blofeld.Theme song Shirley Bassey gives Connery a great farewell with this classic.Q A staple in the series by now.Silly female names Tiffany Case (get it?)...I do like Bond's comments to her on whether he prefers blondes or brunettes...he doesn't mind provided the collars and cuffs match! Plenty O'Toole! Misogyny In the pre-title sequence Bond strikes a woman...but then again this can be read as Bond being a non-discriminatory user of force on people who don't co-operate with his questioning. He also slaps another woman later on in the movie. Pretty much a staple part of the Connery years. As a flipside to this, I think that gay men might take offence to the dated representation of them...which is why I put in my review title Carry on up the Khyber.Wine jibber-jabber God yes.

Great witty dialogue and terrific performances by all make this an amazing ensemble piece. I watch this every time it is on TV and it makes me laugh without fail. My daughter loves it as much as I and that shows that it has not dated as far as the comedy goes. I even like Redford in this and I don't really like his movies. The chemistry between him and Fonda is just right but it is Mildred Natwick that steals this film. If there is a weak link in this then it is Charles Boyer as the eccentric guy upstairs,Victor Velasco. He is not really believable as a character. You would have to be a REALLY lousy actor to mess up great lines like Simon gives to his actors and everyone delivers them with immaculate timing. It is a play on film so don't expect action but it is wicked witty and sharp in every other respect. Herbert Edelman is a wonderful comic actor also to be seen in Simon's masterpiece The Odd Couple as Murray the cop. He has a small role in this but he is brilliant in it too.

A travesty of justice - surely it couldn't happen again? In 1997, it did happened again but this time it got a lot worse! Titanic got the thumbs up with its big budget and cute love story when in reality LA Confidential, a gritty film which is almost anonymous by comparison, should have walked it. Certainly one of the best and most intelligent films of the nineties by far, this movie included four of the best acting performances of the decade. Kim Basinger proved that she can act (and in doing so did get an Oscar), whilst a relatively unknown Australian Soap Opera Actor by the name of Guy Pearce waltzed onto the big screen for the first time and stole the show. Add to the mix, Russell Crowe as the cop who dishes out the beatings and the sublime Kevin Spacey and you get an intelligent American thriller right out of the top drawer.I saw this feel almost by accident as it was that poorly promoted and yet if I had a top 10, LA Confidential would be a 'must have'. Its like a drug - as the plot twists and turns the viewer is literally waiting for the next fix to arrive. And it does in spades.There are times when the Academy gets their selections correct. There are other times they get it catastrophically wrong. This is one of those times. Give an Oscar at the time to an unfashionable, unknown Australian who has graduated from Soap Land? - you can almost hear their screams!!
