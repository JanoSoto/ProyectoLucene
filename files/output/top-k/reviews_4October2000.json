It was like watching a train wreck.  The jokes were horrible, old and cliche-ridden.

It was painful.  I was embarrassed for all actors involved.  The scene in which Julia Styles dances around to Let's Stay Together by Al Green is particularly offensive.  But not quite as bad as the end when Prinze starts singing Can't get enough of your love by Barry White.  I guess the fact that these two upper class spoiled white kids are singing black R&B songs from the 70's is supposed to make them cool or something, but it just seems forced. In summation, the movie is god-awful, but I recommend you see it just so you can get all worked up about how bad it is like I did.

When I heard his next movie was to be a musical, I was overjoyed beyond words, and Dancer in the Dark is no disappointment. It is everything Breaking the Waves was, and more, and more powerful.Of the little I have seen of Von Trier's work, I've come to understood he works in very sharp contrasts. He will have joy one second which all too quickly becomes despair. What better way of visualising this than with big Hollywood musical numbers punctuated with harsh, dull, shaky handheld footage?The story is similar to Breaking the Waves - Bjork's character Selma is slowly going blind, meaning she will lose her job as a factory worker, which she is doing overtime to earn money for an operation for a son so that his eyes do not suffer the same fate. As she earns almost enough to pay, the money is stolen by a greedy neighbour cop who is having money troubles. Things go wrong, and he ends up dead, and Selma goes to jail to await death by hanging. She dies, like Bess in Breaking the Waves, because she is 'good'.Yes, the ending is as bad as everyone says. If there is a cinema in the world where there was not the utmost silence before the credits rolled, well I'd be ashamed to be in it. There's no tears for this movie, just pure dispair, a feeling of being let down, but as the final title says This isn't the last song unless we let it be. It's a small consolation, but what this movie is trying to say is, this is bad, but we only lose if we let it get to us. The songs in this movie will continue to come back in your head, so perhaps Von Trier succeeded in creating a tragic movie that will not go down. It's another masterpiece.

I had no preconceived ideas about it. I liked it. I think a lot of it is totally real. Having read most of the reviews for KIDS, I can tell you that half the people will say that this movie is totally ridiculous, and that teenagers aren't like this, and that life isn't like this, and the other half will say that KIDS is brilliant and that teenagers are like this, and that life is like this. People have different experiences as teenagers and with teenagers, so it is safe to say that some people will encounter kids just like these & some won't. But, the fact is that they do exist.

While living in Malaysia, a friend of mine who was Chinese showed me a copy of Akira on laser disc. I was completely riveted from start to finish. Never before had I seen an animated film with such depth and complexity. Such fleshed out, three dimensional characters that seemed alive and breathing and went beyond caricatures or stereotypes. This film works on so many levels. It is a purely visceral experience but philosophical also in addressing important issues. Great mixture of action, neo noir and science fiction. Kind of like a cross between Bladerunner and Scanners with everything thrown out except for the kitchen sink. It's a fascinating and bleak examination of a futuristic dystopia that is just as vivid and real of an environment I have seen in any film, animated or live action. The basic premise of the movie revolves around a group of bikers in Tokyo and when one of their gang named Tetsuo who is injured after a battle with a rival gang is taken away by the Military and subjected to various government experiments and genetic alterations which endow him with telepathic abilities. Soon there Frankenstein creation becomes unstable and runs amok and ends up destroying almost all of Tokyo as a result.  Superb film and highly recommeded to animation , scifi and filmbuffs.

THE WIZARD OF OZ is gooey sometimes, but when it does cough up its winged monkeys, grinning witch and scowling apple trees, I find them eerier than anything in RETURN because they're such a contrast to their surroundings.The later film's constant creepiness gets to be kind of tedious.Nevertheless, it was foolish of me to snort at the entire movie. I watched it again recently and was surprised at how much more effective it was, in spite of the complaints I still have about it. It creates a subtle sense of otherworldliness that other, more celebrated fantasies are sorely missing, and some of its scenes - like the one with the beautiful heads - have stayed in my mind ever since my first viewing.

This movie has garnered much divided opinion; both camps are right. It sucks AND it's great. First of all, immediately dismiss every opinion that whines 'where's the blood?'. Simpletons who need monsters and gore to officially enjoy a horror movie should park their cars on road shoulders and read back issues of FANGORIA while waiting for the next highway fatality to rubberneck. This is essentially a ghost story, and ghost stories frighten with mood and suggestion, not with slashed carotid arteries. But most of the naysayers have a point after the overkill of the media hype, you DO walk away deeply disappointed after the first viewing. The narrative structure, such as it is, is clumsy and tedious. But part of that disappointment is due to the fact that horror movies are marketed to yahoos, and otherwise-rational viewers have become all too willing to think and act like yahoos when watching a horror movie in a theater. And who can blame 'em? This is what you get after 20 years of horror 'comedies' that substitute CGI, 'dream' sequences, brand-name psychos, and idiot movie critics who analogize the horror genre down to the level of a 'rollercoaster ride'. To release a serious, straightfaced, artistic horror movie nowadays is to ask audiences to think unsettling thoughts and FEEL something genuine far easier to let the latex do the talking over a heavy-metal soundtrack and hope you can con enough kids into believing a 'director's cut' DVD of ELM STREET 12 is a statement for the ages worth owning. Now, while BLAIR WITCH is far from perfect, it does have one 'monster' that no fx wizard could ever approach...those damned woods. Anyone who's ever gotten lost on a camping trip, or even driven through the woods at night, knows exactly what I'm saying here. There's something deeply, frighteningly eldritch and pre-human about wooded areas. Early in the movie, the three students drive past a rotted, primitive shack nestled in the woods. The shack plays no part whatsoever in the later scenes, it's just a two-second visual throwaway, but it called up disturbing memories. I've driven past a dozen shacks like that, and I always wonder who lives there, COULD live there? I never think 'those people must be desperately poor'; instead, I think 'this is what communing with nature really means'. Nature isn't Bambi and Grizzly Adams, it's harsh, unforgiving, cruel, remorseless; the territory of elder Gods who predate our warm and fuzzy civilized notions of deities and divinities. To live out in those woods and survive, you must bring tribute and make offerings to elemental forces so terrible that our ancestors finally fled, formed socities, created cities....ain't NOTHING scarier than the wild. As the three kids in this movie venture deeper into the woods, I felt a deep intuitive foreboding forming in the most primitive jelly of my brain. They're doomed because they've learned to be afraid of people but they've forgotten to be afraid of Nature, and deeper they go into a place where the very terrain- the rocks, the trees, the dirt beneath their feet - is the predator stalking them. All the faux-hostility they've learned from rap music and schoolyard brawls can't help them now. If you saw this flick and left the theater underwhelmed, see it again, alone, late at night. You might think twice about preserving any rainforest anywhere. The 'movie' part of BLAIR WITCH may be weak tea, but those haunted woods are scarier than any weightlifter in a hockey mask.

All the faux-hostility they've learned from rap music and schoolyard brawls can't help them now. If you saw this flick and left the theater underwhelmed, see it again, alone, late at night. You might think twice about preserving any rainforest anywhere. The 'movie' part of BLAIR WITCH may be weak tea, but those haunted woods are scarier than any weightlifter in a hockey mask.

This movie has garnered much divided opinion; both camps are right. It sucks AND it's great. First of all, immediately dismiss every opinion that whines 'where's the blood?'. Simpletons who need monsters and gore to officially enjoy a horror movie should park their cars on road shoulders and read back issues of FANGORIA while waiting for the next highway fatality to rubberneck. This is essentially a ghost story, and ghost stories frighten with mood and suggestion, not with slashed carotid arteries. But most of the naysayers have a point after the overkill of the media hype, you DO walk away deeply disappointed after the first viewing. The narrative structure, such as it is, is clumsy and tedious. But part of that disappointment is due to the fact that horror movies are marketed to yahoos, and otherwise-rational viewers have become all too willing to think and act like yahoos when watching a horror movie in a theater. And who can blame 'em? This is what you get after 20 years of horror 'comedies' that substitute CGI, 'dream' sequences, brand-name psychos, and idiot movie critics who analogize the horror genre down to the level of a 'rollercoaster ride'. To release a serious, straightfaced, artistic horror movie nowadays is to ask audiences to think unsettling thoughts and FEEL something genuine far easier to let the latex do the talking over a heavy-metal soundtrack and hope you can con enough kids into believing a 'director's cut' DVD of ELM STREET 12 is a statement for the ages worth owning. Now, while BLAIR WITCH is far from perfect, it does have one 'monster' that no fx wizard could ever approach...those damned woods. Anyone who's ever gotten lost on a camping trip, or even driven through the woods at night, knows exactly what I'm saying here. There's something deeply, frighteningly eldritch and pre-human about wooded areas. Early in the movie, the three students drive past a rotted, primitive shack nestled in the woods. The shack plays no part whatsoever in the later scenes, it's just a two-second visual throwaway, but it called up disturbing memories. I've driven past a dozen shacks like that, and I always wonder who lives there, COULD live there? I never think 'those people must be desperately poor'; instead, I think 'this is what communing with nature really means'. Nature isn't Bambi and Grizzly Adams, it's harsh, unforgiving, cruel, remorseless; the territory of elder Gods who predate our warm and fuzzy civilized notions of deities and divinities. To live out in those woods and survive, you must bring tribute and make offerings to elemental forces so terrible that our ancestors finally fled, formed socities, created cities....ain't NOTHING scarier than the wild.

The director took a risk in casting a relatively unknown actress (Magnuson) in a lead role, but that risk paid off - she turned in a faultless, feisty performance, and I really believed that she was a top notch confidant businesswoman whose love life was a mess. John Malkovich is equally good, and it is so nice to see him cast against type and doing comedy for a change - and two roles to boot - which he manages very well. A far cry from Dangerous Liaisons, Malkovich works hard to give the android depth and character, when Ulysses could have easily become so two-dimensional. Instead we have the pleasure of watching him grow and gradually develop the emotions and human characteristics that we take for granted, so that if you rewind and watch how Ulysses was at the beginning, he will seem completely different. Equally, Dr Peters, though arrogant and dispassionate, does evoke some sympathy and compassion with the audience. In an ironic turn, watch how machinelike Jeff seems in comparison to Ulysses towards the end, you will be surprised!Brilliant! The scene at the wedding when Ulysses tells Frankie he loves her was perfect and particularly moving.

It seemed such a magical thing, so strange, so... old. Having finally seen it now, I must say that I was stunned. Not only did Metropolis drown in said feelings, it also is a remarkably fine effort by a cunning director. Of course, the plot story has some little faults, but the film is so overwhelming that you can but forget all that. If Metropolis would have been made now, and its special effects would have evolved in comparison to time, then it not only blows The Matrix away, but would even make it look like some dumb no-budget movie made by over-enthusiastic teenagers (no offence to the Wachowski brothers nor The Matrix, of course). A must-see for film-fans, Fritz Lang admirers, sci-fi fanatics and film-lovers all around the world. From the intro (reminiscent of Pink Floyd's The Wall movie) to the very mysterious Babel-sequence over to the morale-packed ending, truly an experience.
