[{"date":"19 October 2007","score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Alright, for the most part I like this movie very much. Yes, yes I know that it's not faithful to the book, but I do believe they readily admitted to taking inspiration from other Austen works as well as the author herself. I in fact read, or tried to read, the book and found it dull and uninspiring, unlike other Austen novels. For these reasons, I don't have any objections on that score.What I do find regrettable is the insistence on trying to make the story modern and wicked. Firstly, Jane Austen's works have always stood the test of time without trying to modernize them. I find Pride and Prejudice more relevant than many movies based on novels written 10 years ago. And secondly, the charm of Jane Austen is that her characters are in no way wicked! They have faults abundantly, but the heroines and heroes are undoubtedly good. They are not sleazy. I hate to think that being naughty is the equivalent of being modern. Or that every story that mentions slavery must make a big deal about how horrible it was and good people will instinctively realize that and will stand against it. We all know slavery was bad, but it was a way of life for a very long time and believe it or not, not every good person was an abolitionist. All this to say that the forced modernity jars very unsettlingly with the characteristics anyone who is familiar with history knows and expects to see.Buuut despite the rant, I was altogether pleased. I felt the changes in Fanny were an improvement and though she felt inconsistent, I could understand where waverings in her personality came from. I think many mistake her steadfast loyalty to Edmund for smugness and prudery, and truthfully I might not like her if I had to live with her in person, but I felt for her on screen. The rest of the cast did very well, though Mary was too much vixen, even making insinuations with Fanny.It was very interesting at the end where Fanny states it all could have ended very differently, but it didn't. I definitely saw that as I was rooting for Henry most of the time. I do truly feel if he had shown more patience or Fanny had accepted him, they may have grown to love each other and things could have still ended happily. But Austen seems intent on having that one deceitful man in all her stories Wickham, Willoughby, Frank, Henry...Ah well, all in all a good film. One of the more melancholy of the Austens, alongside Sense and Sensibility- when things get dark, they get DARK. But don't worry, the sun will shine again, as suns are wont to do...
