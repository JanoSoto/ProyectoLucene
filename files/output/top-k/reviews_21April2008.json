Mostly I feel like his performances get a little old for me, since he can only really play himself, in all his awkward, stuttering glory. He has a peculiarly dry style of humor that, to me, seems to get a little routine. He sort of satirizes the world around him as though consistently astonished at the strangeness of it all, dropping clever comments and observations as though by accident. He's not my favorite filmmaker, but one thing that seems pretty consistent about his films is that they are generally brilliantly written, and Mighty Aphrodite is no exception. I was a little put off by the intercutting to the bad performance art group, acting out Allen's interpretation of life's little absurdities on a decaying Greek amphitheater, and in increasingly modern and unpoetic language (Certain thoughts are better left unthunk!). Allen stars as Lenny, a sportswriter in a failing marriage with a woman named Amanda (Helena Bonham Carter), who thinks that if they have a baby it might save their marriage. The film opens with their conversation on the subject, in which they discuss all of the possibilities, including adoption, which Lenny immediately dismisses as unacceptable. All it takes, however, is one look at the cute kid from the adoption agency and his heart melts. Max, the new baby, soon grows up into a remarkable young man, and Lenny sets off on a personal mission to find his birth mother. He believes that any kid as smart as Max must have an equally brilliant mother, and he wants to know where the prodigal son came from. In Allen's illustration of some of life's great ironies, the birth mother that he discovered is a woman who calls herself Linda or Leslie, when she's not using one of the screen names she adopts in her performances in porn films, which she believes is just acting. There is a strange chemistry between Linda and Lenny, because she is so much younger and taller and sexier than he is, and because she's a prostitute and thinks he is just another paying customer. Quite the contrary, he is so astonished and horrified that he can hardly stand up. There is obviously a very strong sexual undertone in the movie, since Linda is both a hooker and porn star, and I've read reviews of the movie that suggest that even the graphic sexual descriptions have a sense of innocence, as if they are not really signifiers for the explicit sexual acts that they describe. I wouldn't quite say that. I think they take on that sense of detachment because Linda is so unbelievably dumb that she doesn't really understand the meaning of what she's talking about. She seems childish when she talks about it, which lends a sense of detachment, but I would hardly say innocence.Lenny's mission is to get Linda to clean up her life and become a respectable woman, like he imagined Max's mother to be. An intellectual giant is clearly out of the question, so he decides to settle for just getting her into a healthy and respectable relationship. His first attempt is a young boxer who dreams of moving back to his brother's farm and becoming a potato farmer. He is a match for Linda's diminutive intellect, and there is a touchingly awkward scene where he introduces the two of them in a park and then leaves. Both of them are clearly clueless about what to do.For almost the entire movie we're waiting to see when Lenny will tell Linda the real reason why he sought her out, especially when she emotionally reveals that she once had a child but had to give him up. The other revelation that we wait for is for Kevin, Linda's new boyfriend, to discover who she really is. Lenny had given him an impossible story about her, one which would fall apart the first time they had a normal conversation. When it finally happens, he reacts violently. Mira Sorvino's performance as Linda might be the most irritating performance that has ever been nominated for an Oscar. Her bizarre falsetto whine always made me think of the kind of voice that a babysitter might adopt to make the kids laugh when they miss their mom. Her mind is absolutely vacant and uncomprehending of the world around her, so it's hard to imagine her in a normal relationship at all, which may be why we never see that happen. She's also given ridiculous lines like Not a day doesn't go by that I don't wake up thinking about him. The double negatives render it nearly meaningless, but we can guess what she means.The film's biggest weakness, however, is the astonishingly obvious plot devices, which are so incredibly witless and weak that they stand out like big red flags in an otherwise well written movie. Linda's pimp won't let her quit but has an intense love of sports (I'd give my own mother for courtside Knick's tickets!). Lenny, conveniently, is a sportswriter. Or, my favorite, the movie spends all this time trying to find a good man for Linda, but when all efforts fail, Mr. Right quite literally falls out of the blue sky. Nice. Thankfully, the movie ends with an interesting twist of fate that calls attention to the movie's interesting assertions about the human condition. It's a strange tale of highly flawed people eventually achieving happiness. Maybe most people would choose a different form of happiness, but what they found this might have been the only kind available to them.

I have come to love Robert Deniro as an actor, and I've always been kind of indifferent towards the iconic Martin Scorsese although I have not seen a lot of his stuff...some of it I hated and some of it I respected. Plus Taxi Driver is no doubt a cinema classic and I needed to see it. It started out a little slow and I was beginning to think that this would be another over rated classic and then the magic of Taxi Driver started to work. It's the kind of film that is really stealthy because it starts to grow on you and really sucks you into the dark and disturbing world. The film really depressing and dark and the story really has a haunting tone and it slowly starts to really move you and suck you into the world of this depressed, insomniac loner who is basically having a quarter life crisis. He's late twenties, feels like he has no direction, can't sleep, is not well educated, angry, and wants to make a difference in the world. He has no social skills to speak of and really has this passion to change someone no matter what. Really the film lies in the hands of the taxi driver and the actor that portrays him and that is quite simply what made the film and the actor famous forever.Robert Deniro stars as Travis Bickle, a Vietnam vet who fits everything I just explained above but you need to see his performance to understand. This film is of course the original source for Deniro's infamous ...you talking to me? Bickle is just a character full of empathy and you can't help but feel for him and really get drawn into his slightly twisted mind. He has such depth and emotion to his character, some more subtle than others. He is brilliant and this is almost a one man show on his part as he drives his cab from situation to situation. Cybill Shepherd is okay in a fairly small role as the object of Deniro's rather twisted fascination. The two of them clash and it adds something to Deniro's story but she doesn't really impress. A very young Jodie Foster post Disney movies plays an underage hooker of all things and she gets a lot of acclaim for this movie and I think it is credited as hoisting her out of child actor and into the role of adult actor. I think she is a little over credited for the role because it's quite small BUT she is excellent in it. Her role is also very dark and disturbing and her and Deniro have great chemistry. Harvey Keitel is terrific in a small role as well, as Foster's pimp and disturbing love interest 'Sport.' Also watch for great supporting roles by Peter Boyle, and Albert Brooks.I can't stress enough how dark this movie is. I mean in a way it's like there is this ray of light throughout the whole film and remarkably after everything that happens the film gets a happy ending?! I never saw that coming at all and it made the film even better. The last five or ten minutes of the film is an absolute blood bath like Scorsese likes to do but everything fits together and it just happens to work like magic. It might be the most depressing film I've ever seen and yet everything works out which makes it truly a feel good film in many ways. There is so much to ask yourself when the credits role and there is no doubt in my mind why this film has become timeless because it could be watched again and again just to get a feel for the character and everything involved. I can't recommend this enough for anyone who wants a truly intelligent, deeply moving film. You can't be disappointed with it. 9\/10 (Probably should be a 10\/10 but after a few more views perhaps?)

There is so much to ask yourself when the credits role and there is no doubt in my mind why this film has become timeless because it could be watched again and again just to get a feel for the character and everything involved. I can't recommend this enough for anyone who wants a truly intelligent, deeply moving film. You can't be disappointed with it. 9\/10 (Probably should be a 10\/10 but after a few more views perhaps?)

The character stereotypes are very strong and well played.

Critics have discussed the superficial role of some of the other characters. However, an important point is that many high school students are often immature, superficial, and sex-obsessed. Perhaps not to the extent that this film shows. But if the film DIDN'T show the extreme attitudes of the students, you would have a fairly ordinary movie. Fast Times is positively reflected in fun times and the exciting escapades of high school kids. This movie shows that it can be fun without a major plot or seriousness attached to it, and not many movies can say that.The downside is that due to conflicts between the director and the scriptwriter, there will not be a full extended version of FTARH. The network TV print omits or dubs the bad language and removes all nudity. However, the TV version also has several scenes of added (and interesting) dialogs between the characters, that are not present in commercial home video versions, and probably never will be unless an agreement is reached between director Amy Heckerling and screenwriter Cameron Crowe, which is very unlikely.However, the performances of Sean Penn and Ray Walston push this film near the top.

I realize that this was probably a benchmark for special effects when it was made, but now the effects seem incredibly dated(which they don't, at the very least to the same extent, in pieces from the same period, best example being Star Wars), and many scenes seem clichéd today, even though I suppose they were fresh when it was made. I guess the main problem with the thing is that it doesn't age well, but I also think it lacks too much in both character development and humor... just a little comic relief would have made the nearly two hours go by so much easier(for me, this merely gets slower and less watchable with each repeated viewing). Attempts at making you laugh fall flat on their faces. There are far more unintentional laughs to be had, at various corny and odd things(why does this have so much weird stuff in it, and why do the people who love it just accept that?). More often than not, to me(and one person I know who *loves* these movies), this just ends up being too hard to take seriously. I'm willing to entertain the theory that Ridley Scott's stuff just isn't for me, I've yet to be amazed by him. For how much sheer, unsynthesized acting talent this has, the players have next to nothing to work with(they do turn in fine performances). Nonetheless, the film does manage to scare me and provide some shocks, even though I've seen this and the other films at least three times before. The film manages to establish a pretty nicely done, spooky atmosphere that lasts for most of the film, despite its shortcomings and the very formulaic ending. The plot isn't bad, and it takes off almost immediately, keeping you fairly interested. The characters are so-so, though there aren't any really startlingly poorly written ones. The creature effects are decent enough, and they do not fail to impress at least a little. The editing has moments that are just strange, the cinematography has reasonably little to offer. Props to whoever ensured that the realism was kept at such a high level. The sets, and in general the production design, is all well-done(some is nothing short of breathtaking). I've read one suggestion that stories set where this is and similar are more straining on the audience, and they are more likely to be bored, in spite of the potential talent possessed by those who put it together... I'm inclined to agree. There is some language, and violence as well as gore is also featured herein. I have to admit, I see this as valuable more as an introduction to the world of the title creature, and find, for example, Cameron's expansion of, and further adventure within, it considerably more worthwhile. Don't expect a masterpiece, and prepare to test your patience, especially if you've seen many of these films. The Director's Cut(though he feels the original fits that bill better... hey, at least it's not as bad as the alternate name, Extended Version, which is even a misnomer as it *shortens* the overall length) adds a few things, which you may find worth a look, if you like it(not that there are that many, I count five chapters with additions in the DVD's own breakdown). The commentary track is an OK enough listen, some of the stuff said is cool to hear. I recommend it to fans of alien-type science fiction, and fans of sci-fi horror films(as such, it's good enough) in general.

And it's not enough to concentrate on just one either there's always something of note going on in at least two panels (and which two varies continuously), which kind of begs the question, just how much of your brain to do you use when watching a conventional movie? Or alternatively, how many brains do you have? Certainly, watching 'Timecode' is never a relaxing experience, but Figgis does some things to make our lives easier with the remarkable soundtrack, for example (the director even composed some of the songs on it) and the way that the aural focus shifts between the segments; or the fact that each segment is shot without any cutting. In some ways, this latter fact is the most surprising of the movie who can make a movie without cutting? and yet, in pulling this off, Figgis actually comes some way towards the justification of his wider structure. For telling four stories at once brings sufficient (OK, maybe excessive) busyness to allow each story to be told in real time, often a holy grail of drama but rarely achievable (unless you want Jack Bauer ridiculousness or 'Big Brother' tedium). But aside from the structure, is it worth watching? This is a harder question to answer, it's very hard to put the form of the movie out of your mind when watching it, but I was moved in the end. And while the film may have been simply too extraordinary to set any trends, it deserves much credit for its unique blend of audaciousness and skill.

Ginger offers Stanley $100,000 to speak with her employer, a shadowy man named Gabriel Shear (John Travolta) who lives in Los Angeles. Gabriel offers Stanley ten million dollars if he can crack an encrypted Governmnet bank account in which there is fifteen billion dollars of seized drug money, ten million dollars is a hell of a carrot & Stanley eventually agrees but as the bullets start to fly he realises that he finds himself in a dangerous situation that will either get him killed or sent to prison...This American Australian co-production was directed by Dominic Sena & is a cracking big budget Hollywood action flick that I freely admit I enjoyed a fair bit. The script by co-producer Skip Woods has it's good & bad points, first the good. It has a good pace & never gets boring, it has lots of stand out spectacular action set-pieces that are silly & very improbable but at the same time highly exciting, satisfying & over-the-top, the character's are reasonable & I liked the motives behind Gabriel's heist. It wasn't quite as clear cut as in many films, it's not quite as black and white as I am sure many might share his sentiments that when terrorists strike we should retaliate with even more extreme actions. His logic of 'if they kill one American tourist we kill one of their entire villages' has a certain something to it, while it's undoubtedly not the right thing to think or say deep down inside many of us I suspect we have all had such thoughts & ideas especially after some of the truly horrendous terrorist acts committed against Western society. I liked the end too, I liked the way Gabriel basically got away with it & again most Hollywood films surely would have had the hero kill the bad guy in a very traditional climactic fight sort of way. Now the bad. I thought most of the character's were one dimensional & the ever awful Halle Berry's in it but my biggest gripe with Swordfish is a lot of exposition surrounding the plot was unfathomable to me. I don't consider myself computer illiterate at all but some of the terminology used just went straight over my head, for example terms like Hydra's, dropping bombs through the back door, worms, 128 bit encryption's & the like just didn't click with me. It had the unwanted effect of pulling me out of the film & left me feeling somewhat detached from it. During these bits I just didn't really know what was being said or understand it, unless your a computer genius I doubt many would.Director Sena does a good job, the action scenes are suitably overblown & spectacular. From car chases to shoot outs to explosions to a bus being picked up by a helicopter & flown across Los Angeles there's plenty of high octane action to take your mind off an otherwise somewhat shallow script that tries to paper over some of the cracks with computer jargon that really doesn't mean a whole lot. Swordfish was withdrawn from cinemas in late 2001 after the Septmeber 11 terror attacks on New York & Washington & it's easy to see why with it's story based around terrorists. The violence isn't that graphic but there's still some fights & plenty of good old fashioned death.With a supposed budget of about $80,000,000 Swordfish has that big budget Hollywood polish about it & is very well made. There's some good stylish photography & plenty of macho posturing. The acting is decent from a good cast, Travolta doesn't have that much to do but he makes a good villain although I hate Helle Berry as an actress. I think she's useless but luckily her presence isn't enough to ruin the film, her semi-nude scene proves she has horrible breast's as well.Swordfish is a very enjoyable Hollywood action flick, apart from the awful Berry the cast is good & while the story is a little shallow at times the plentiful action scenes make up for it.

The scene in which Clift watches the resolution between death camp survivors and mayor, by Franz, is easily the classic scene of the movie, and one of the all time great scenes.

Yet this is a movie that just has no laughs in it and it's as if they even did tried hard enough.It's of course a movie with a very simple thin story, that also on top of that is an highly unlikely one, even for comedy standards. The way the entire movie progresses is also rather predictable, which makes this a very little uninteresting and unoriginal movie to watch. It's of course not a movie to take serious in the first place but in that case the movie should had had some more comedy and entertainment in it, which it just simply hadn't. Instead it also tries to be more moralistic, which often is an annoying approach for any comedy. Mel Smith obviously has some comical talent but he yet still needs to proof himself as a good comedy movie director.Problem is also its two main characters. They are being presented in this movie as strong, smart, independent women but yet they do all these stupid things. So something is wrong here with the approach. And no offense but lets be honest here for a moment, can you at least name 5 good movies that has 2 female characters as the movie's main leads? It's just something that rarely ever works out successfully. especially when you have a movie with a non-serious approach.

I don't think it quite has the legendary status as some of other Connery's Bond films like Goldfinger and it wasn't quite up to par with some of the others I have seen either like the aforementioned Goldfinger or Dr. No BUT it definitely has some distinguishable qualities to it. First of all so much of this film involves underwater stunts and scenes underwater and not a lot of films do that when the entire idea of the film is not under water. It takes action to a new level below the sea and that is a very cool idea. The story is decent and understandable and easy to follow, we find out some more details about the organization Bond works for (like that there are other double 0 agents working), it has a memorable villain in Largo with his dastardly eye patch, and some really great action sequences. In fact Thunderball might have the most action thus far in the Bond films before it. However I still didn't think it had quite the same flare or feel than the previous films. Bond wasn't quite the ladies man that he usually is but he did seem a little tougher around the edges as well during his fight scenes. Thunderball also marks itself as being the most violent in the series thus far as well.Sean Connery returns to the role of none other than James Bond. Connery is still my favorite Bond so far. He just completely embodies the role and I will be sad to move on to another Bond when I get past his films. Connery is legendary in the role and I think he set the bar for all future Bonds. Claudine Auger is the latest Bond girl and she perhaps has the most significant role out of any of the Bond girls and yet I found her almost boring in the role. Her and Connery had zero chemistry and she was so dull in the role sadly. Adolfo Celi plays the latest Bond Villain and number 2 in the SPECTRE organization. He is a memorable villain although doesn't match Dr. No or Goldfinger in my mind. And he doesn't really have any notable henchman per se. Still he is a good adversary and does a good job at being bad. Bernard Lee returns as no nonsense M and Lois Maxwell returns briefly as Miss Moneypenny. The role of casual Bond partner, CIA Agent Felix Leiter is played decently by Rik Van Nutter. I wish they had one actor stick to the role because he changes a lot.If there is one solid reason to watch Thunderball it is the final battle at the end of the film in the last fifteen minutes. This scene might be first of all the best end battle of any film ever, and it is one of the coolest movie scene in history. The bad guys decked out in black (of course) including the head guy Largo are all under water in full scuba gear. They are ambushed by good guys who parachute from the sky into the sea in full Scuba gear and bright Orange and a battle...a war between them breaks out using harpoon guns, knives and fists. Bond gets in the mix and the result is the coolest under water fight I have ever seen that continues on for a good ten, fifteen minutes. A guy gets a rod in the eye, people are getting harpooned everywhere, people are drowning, bodies everywhere...it's just wicked cool. Everything builds up to this scene and it's really quite astounding. Terence Young directs the film returning after the less than stellar outing of From Russia With Love but he redeems himself with this decent Bond installment. I know that sometimes the Bond films move into a little bit of the cheesy dialog and action and some cheesy special effects from time to time but part of the problem with Thunderball is some of the action and scenes seemed especially cheesy. But then there is plenty of action and explosions, a little light on the story but it definitely is worthy of the Bond name. 7.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 April 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" In my continuing new found fascination with James Bond I watched Thunderball.

Deciding to sell the castle, they spend the night so they can take inventory in the morning. Exploring the castle, they start to find evidence of why they've inherited the castle and who was living in the castle before them. She starts to suspect that someone else is in the castle with them, which they laugh off as being a wish born from her handicap, and their irritation towards each other continues to grow. As they soon fall under a series of strange accidents and disappearances, they come to believe that there is someone inside the house, and are forced to defend themselves in hopes of getting out alive.The Good News This one here wasn't that bad, and had some quite good moments to it. The fact that the castle here is an old-school Gothic masterpiece is something to be admired, since there's something about the design and flow of it that just lends itself to a creepy surrounding. There's the grand design of the place with the way that it's constructed and furnished, as well as the fact that it genuinely looks like it hasn't been lived in for a long time due to the amount of dust, cloth over the furniture and much more, lead to an overall great location. So many scenes here play up the creepiness of the castle, from the blind walk into the catacombs following a cat to the walk-through to gather inventory to the great sequence where they're chasing off after strange noises in the distance and are unsure of what they're chasing after, are all excellent examples of the film using the glorious castle suspense in great ways. The design of the creature in here is just as good, as the deranged and deformed features, over-sized teeth and the sharpened claws on the hands and feet are perfect in keeping with a great monster which is imposing and quite creepy. Once the bedspread is utilized manages to improve the design and make it much better. The scene where it escaped, by biting it's finger off to wriggle out of chains, is a great scene and manages to work in a couple brutal moments and is an overall great scene. The opening sequence is just as good, getting the brutal punishment underway that starts it off with a disturbing, cruel manner, setting up the rest of the film perfectly. There's a rather sleazy sex scene in the catacombs which manages to get really nice amounts of nudity into the film, that is well-done and combined with a later sequence with the prostitute inside the lair, comprise some nice amounts of nudity. The last big part of this that works is the really nice gore provided here, since the kills are really bloody. There's one that has the skin from around their hips and legs eaten away, another is bashed in the head repeatedly with a large chain, there's an eyeball eaten out, slashings with broken beer bottles and much more in here that makes for some bloody good times. All of these here make the film rather enjoyable.The Bad News This one here only had a few small flaws to it. The fact that the film spends a long portion of time with the family drama and the tensions with each other over their dead child is something that can get irritating. It's something that requires everyone to simply yell at each other for no reason at all, since the flashback actually makes it clear that there's no reason to be like it at all due to it being a complete and total accident, and is just thrown in for the last-second reprieve at the end. That is obvious, and ever since the flashback that supports everything from the one character states, all it does is just aggravate due to it taking up so much time on something that already has a foregone conclusion. The fact that it starts getting to the main action a little late in the film is something else, since this one has the creature loose about twenty minutes in, yet the rampage doesn't really start until close to the end, leaving a large middle section creepy but action-less, and that can be a turn-off to some. Otherwise, this here was a really fun film.The Final Verdict A really fun and enjoyable creature feature that has enough good parts about it to be able to entertain with only a few mild flaws to hold it down.

This one just seems dead and out there for no other reason then to just make another movie for the fun of it. I wasn't having fun. Instead, I was yearning this film to finish. Oh, well.

It's New York City and an individual, known only as 'Simon'. He has planted explosive devices in different locations of the city, and the only way for McClane to stop them is to follow what Simon says. Dragging Zeus into the problem, McClane must solve every riddle that Simon gives and get to each bomb before it goes off.Bruce Willis looks tired. Really tired. I am tired. Really tired. Seeing how this is the fourth Die Hard film I've seen and this is the third Die Hard film in the franchise, I'm not surprised I got this reaction. Everything is just too tiring to watch and enjoy anymore. To top it off, this movie takes entirely too long to set up everything and entirely too long itself. If the movie was fast paced and cut about 40 minutes out, I'm sure it would've worked.Anyway, I was looking forward to this movie. I was disappointed. I don't know. I just expected much more and some ingenious ideas floating around. There is maybe one idea that I remember that was smart and neat but other than that, nada. No, this is on a much larger scale than the first two, yes, but everything gets old and boring and uninteresting after 40 minutes and the climax is just unnecessarily long too.Bruce Willis' performance the third time around seems too tiring. He doesn't look interested in his character anymore. The one liners aren't as fun to hear as the other three movies and that one liner seemed out of place, as if placed in there because the previous two movies had that line. Jeremy Irons performance was decent, I guess, but not anything special though and Samuel L. Jackson's performance was pretty good.In the end, the movie was a big let down and a huge disappointment. I found Die Hard a decent action movie, Die Hard 2 really entertaining, and Live Free or Die Hard the most fun I've had in the cinema!

They seem the result of a mysteriously invisible success at combining rhythm, camera work, set design, sound, acting and what not.Funny, though, how each time, I'm left with a drilling question what is *wrong* with this incredibly inspired movie? I found some answers reading the following reviews I almost completely second the views of1. sumrrain, April 25th 2001, who mostly nails my feelings better than I could have *AND* offers some possible explanations as to what prevents the movie from being even better;I found also found valuable ideas in the review by2. gpadillo, November 9th 2004 I haven't read Hardy's book, but I like to hear gpadillo's take on, amongst other things, what kind of adaptation we are dealing with here.Now, I personally feel the urge to give credit to Sarah Polley's performance. Her presence in most every scene she appears in is so intense and profound as we perceive the multiple layers and the strength in this girl much less fragile and lost than she appears. As I see it, she provides the second underlying main story, hidden literally by the more spectacular Mullan and Kinski, just as well as her character is sort of hidden and hushed to silence by the painful relationship between her parents.I can't think of a lot of young women coming of age characters portrayed this powerfully. Nathalie Portman in Beautiful Girls as well as Bryce Dallas Howard in The Village come to my mind; not much more, in my very subjective opinion. Both actresses which I have tremendous respect for (and I really couldn't care less if Portman made some career choices considered as poor, or sometimes unfortunate...)This is one of the most ambitious and successful cinematic challenges undertaken in the last ten years, and I really think one can hardly afford to skip it if interested in what a big budget movie *still* can be nowadays.

Take away 1 scene (De Niro shooting the guards) and the average rating for this movie would probably drop 2 to 3 points. And that scene had nothing to do with the actual Vietnam war but was just sort of 'COOL'. I enjoy war flicks and Apocalypse Now is one of my all-time favorite movies.. But this movie just didn't make sense.The editing is terrible.. The wedding scene just goes on and on. I suspect it was the best footage they had shot and they just couldn't bring themselves to cut any of it. Then the war starts.. We see a brief helicopter scene and next thing we know our heroes are in a POW-camp? Excuse me?! What just happened? After that point the movie just gets progressively worse.The plot is just outrageous. You don't have to be a statistician to understand that Walken having a successful career in Russian roulette is absurd.. His successful streak ending just the moment his buddy comes looking for him makes it even more silly. I guess many people see good symbolism for war in the Russian roulette theme and thats part of why this movie scores so high... but come on, you cant reduce the Vietnam war to something that never happened in it..This movie insults my intelligence! Its a silly Hollywood action flick posing as a meaningful war drama.. and quite possibly the most overrated movie of all times!
