We did have greats like Jaws and maybe Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory, but nothing that really took the audience for a fast paced ride. However, in 1977 this little movie called Star Wars hit the market and took its audience by surprise. The film became a cultural phenomenon and essentially created the movie fanboy overnight, becoming one of the highest grossing movies ever made.What exactly is so great about Star Wars? Some may say most people think it's great because it's a CLASSIC MOVIE and that it's only good because it's old or some shi- No, you're dumb. It's that simple, you're just dumb and don't know what you're talking about. The reason Star Wars is so great is because it, somehow after nearly 40 years, STILL holds up as a great movie. Is it perfect? No, there are flaws, but it's still an entertaining action-adventure space opera and should NOT be limited to being enjoyed by just sci- fi dorks.What made the Star Wars prequels so lame was that they were slow, boring, and had a very uninteresting plot narrative that is debatably a story that did not need to be told. Why? Well, a common joke by most amateur movie goers is oh wow, they started with Part IV instead of Part I? How dumb. It's not dumb. Why? Because Part IV is where things got good. One of the many reasons people love the original SW trilogy is because of its characters. Luke, Han, Leia, 3PO, R2, etc., they're all unique characters. You remember each of them and you are interested in what their goals are. That's what the prequels failed at doing having an emotional connection with its audience. (Plus The bit where Han blasts the sh*t out of Greedo is so badass and Lucas should feel ashamed of himself for tinkering it)I don't like to refer to any of the Star Wars movies by their episode number, just by their subtitle. Even then, I always call this first movie Star Wars since that's what it was initially called when it first came out in 1977.Another thing that helps this movie is the film score by the ever so talented John Williams, whose soundtrack for this movie won him his third Academy Award. Somehow, it's the glue that holds the movie together. Without John Williams' film score, that engaging feeling towards the end of the Death Star battle isn't the same. The music helps you get involved with what's happening, even after you've watched the movie a ba-gillion times like I have.Really, what else can be said about Star Wars that just hasn't already been said for decades now? The cinematography is beautiful, the music is brilliant, the characters are great, and the directing is surprisingly good. This was probably the only good Star Wars movie George Lucas ever directed and he had several people making suggestions for him to try new things and maybe change his mind on a couple things.It's like I always say, One man can't make a movie.Of course in January of 1997 (the film's 20th anniversary), Lucas released his Special Edition of Star Wars which included a lot of (very dated) CGI, Greedo shooting before Han (which is bullsh*t and ruins such a badass moment), changed the title to Episode IV - A New Hope, and many other changes. I don't hate the Special Editions as much as many SW fans do, seeing how I think at least 80% of the same movie is still in tact. However, the one thing that makes me LOATHE the Special Editions is how George Lucas (almost like a spoiled, ungrateful child) didn't bother releasing the original versions of these movies along side the SEs. This is not fair. The original cut of Star Wars won several awards and even won a Special Achievement Oscar for its sound effects. I don't like being forced (ha ha) to watch just one version of the movie that's heavily digitalized when the original versions hold up just fine. I may of said it's still 80% of the same movie, but the 20% that Lucas altered really does affect the movie for me&#x85; Whatever Lucas, but just know this Those Academy Awards were given to the Original Unaltered Versions, not the Special Editions. Yes I'm aware Lucas can't affect these movies anymore because Disney took ownership of Lucasfilm from him, but it's been 3 damn years and they haven't said anything releasing the original cuts of Star Wars. Guess I'll have to rely on Harmy and his OriginalTrilogy.com team. Sigh&#x85;Despite this, I just can't describe how brilliant the original Star Wars is. If you could, hunt down the original version of this film (via VHS \/ 2006 DVD \/ Despecialized Edition) and enjoy 120 minutes of one of the most important and greatest movies ever made. It's not A New Hope and it's not Episode IV. It's just simply Star Wars.

With five gallons of blood being pumped a second for the splatterific climax, this film does what SHAUN OF THE DEAD did years and years later it made zombies funny. Shot on a low budget, probably about a millionth of what he had available to him when he made LORD OF THE RINGS, Peter Jackson's BRAINDEAD is a huge cult success that stands repeat viewing just thanks to the sheer humour and originality of the production. Intricate attention to detail has always been one of the director's best aspects and it's just as present here as it was when he became a multi-million pound director all those years later. But in many ways, BRAINDEAD's quirkiness makes it stand out as still one of the best of the director's career, coming just after his Middle Earth trilogy for me.The first hour of the film is an inventive, low budget laugh riot. It mixes together a sweet boy-meets-girl romance with zombies, and the result is clearly uneven but even so it works. The Kiwi angle breathes fresh life into the genre and Jackson explores the zombie mythos in many original ways; forget mundane flesh-munching, these zombies have feelings, have sex, have much more fun than a typical brain-dead gut-muncher you'll find in an Italian gore flick. The acting is over the top throughout, adding to the film's deranged turn. Timothy Balme deserves huge kudos for his character's convincing transformation from lovable geek to macho hero, and Diana Penalver is equally good as his feisty Spanish girlfriend. Yet the cast is also fleshed out with other great turns from the Australian and Kiwi supporting cast. Elizabeth Moody's domineering mother is the obvious stand-out, but for my money the flesh-creeping Ian Watkin is just as good as the slimy Uncle Les. Yet the best turn for me is the guy playing the mod-turned-zombie, who really gives the performance his all. Even though he's stuck with half a body for much of his screen time, he's a real hoot in what is a physically exhausting turn.Anyhow, the first hour is pretty good, full of gross-out comedy &#x96; the custard-eating scene is the notable bit &#x96; and bizarre cameos from a range of odd characters. It's also full of gore and prosthetic effects, from the embalming-machine-gone-wrong set-piece &#x96; try holding down your lunch when you watch that one &#x96; to the rapidly rotting mother and the stand-out fight scene in the graveyard between a kung fu priest and a horde of the undead. So far, so good, but nothing I would ever have watched again. The zombies never number more than half a dozen and the limitations of the budget are obvious; for instance, much is made of a silly zombie baby including a padded-out interlude in a children's park in which Jackson seems to be going too far to make the audience cringe with his bad taste and violence. At around the hour mark, a house party takes place which is soon besieged by the undead &#x96; and then things start getting REALLY gory! The party scene lasts until the movie's climax, which also throws in a giant monster a la KING KONG for some fun and games. It's around forty minutes of classic film-making, as our partygoers attempt to defend themselves against a growing army of the undead. It's here that Jackson's inventiveness really comes to the fore, with a series of outlandish deaths and zombie hijinks, each one crazier than the last! Lightbulbs go through heads, hands exit from mouths and internal organs are soon popping all over the place as the screen becomes awash with blood. Here's where all the money went, and it really shows; in fact, the half-an-hour full-scale zombie attack is one of my favourite moments of cinema and enough to guarantee this whole film a five-star rating. The special effects, all prosthetic, are wonderfully good and Jackson never skimps on his imagination for a second. We get flying severed heads, evil intestines and more splatter than you've ever seen in your life. Then comes the one definitive moment that put this film in the history books for good &#x96; the infamous lawnmower climax. This sees Lionel finally deciding to fight back, employing a petrol lawnmower in his fight against the ravenous zombies &#x96; with extraordinary, eye-poppingly gory results. It's all done humorously, with just the right overdone music and bulging-eyed acting, and thankfully it seems to go on forever; no blink-and-you'll-miss-it stuff going on here, it's all focused lovingly up on screen. A superb ending which makes the film and the first hour worth sitting through, I can't praise it enough. See for yourself!

I thoroughly enjoyed this mystery story, which benefits from a perfectly-cast Charles Bronson playing the film's hero. Although he wasn't the first choice for the role, Bronson is a breath of fresh air away from his grittier DEATH WISH-type films and his stoical turn here is one of the movie's best assets.Making wonderful use of some bleak, snowbound locations, BREAKHEART PASS is a film set entirely on a train and, like the later B-movie UNDER SIEGE 2, the endless momentum of the train ploughing through the countryside is matched by a screenplay that is fast-paced and equally relentless. Veteran director Tom Gries really knows his stuff when it comes to film-making and it shows, as this is pretty much perfect on a technical level. Jerry Goldsmith's score is an exciting, driving piece of work and the photography is crisp and beautiful throughout, one of those films where every scene looks good.The suspense story in itself is involving and thrilling, but on top of that there are a series of action set-pieces which really add to the film's impact. Bronson's train-top fisticuffs with real-life boxing legend Archie Moore is the bit everybody remembers, but there are also some fine, bloody shoot-outs on board the moving train as well as tense sneaking around in the carriages. Special effects for the time are very good, with one of the most horrifying train crashes I've seen on film, and I got a real kick out of seeing one of the villains fall to his death down a ravine! Things eventually culminate in a gung-ho climax using the convention of a tribe of Native American Indians as the villains of the piece, and somehow fresh life is put even into this tired plot element.The film does feel a little clinical and coldly-detached in places and that's because the story is focused on over the characters throughout. I didn't let this bother me in the least; many '70s westerns are the same and this one feels right at home in the genre. Aside from Bronson, there are good turns from a range of willing character actors including Rambo's Richard Crenna, veteran actor Ben Johnson, Charles Durning, Paul Newman's son Scott, the ubiquitous Jill Ireland &#x96; Bronson's wife at the time &#x96; and finally a young-looking Ed Lauter, who would later team up once more as Bronson's gun-buddy in DEATH WISH 3. BREAKHEART PASS has all the right ingredients to be a top-notch, intelligent thriller and it never disappoints. An above-average treat.

I love this movie and I think is better than The Enforcer. This was the third film I saw in my youth as a child. The first and the second movie were Dirty Harry and Magnum Force. I grew up with this film. The scene where Rook (David Hunt) kills with a knife Walker's (Patricia Clarkson) cameraman scares the hell out of me. Evan C. Kim as Al Quan also did a great solid job Harry's partner since than I don't see him in the film business anymore. I don't agree with critics this film is bad, which is not. I have always loved this movie, I even saw the VHS tape in 2003 on a sale sadly I didn't bought it, but I have now whole collection on Blu-ray disc. Patricia Clarkson was in my opinion much better than the actress Sondra Locke. I love the theme music in the opening scene and I love this action flick. This is the first time I see Jim Carrey in this flick as Johnny Squares who gets murdered in his trailer which the killer fills him with drugs. Liam Neeson is also in here as Peter Swan the movie director who becomes the murder suspect in this flick on a dead pool list of people who also Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) becomes the target as him self in it. This movie was directed by Buddy Van Horn who directed previously Any Which Way You Can (1980) the sequel to Every Which Way but Loose (1978) Clint Eastwood films and Pink Cadillac (1989). The Dead Pool is the fifth and final installment in the Dirty Harry film franchise. The 1988 sequel finds Inspector Callahan (Clint Eastwood) trying to solve a series of murders that appears to be linked to a list of celebrities that were deemed likely to be dead in the near future. The film's cast included Liam Neeson, Evan Kim as well as the feature film debut of Jim Carrey. I think this movie is close to The Rookie (1990) another Clint Eastwood flick that Clint directed it him self and I love it. Because Michael Goodwin who plays the character Lt. Ackerman, the last name Ackerman was later used in Charlie Sheen's character The Rookie (1990). Both of the movies are each other like and they are both good. Just in The Rookie Clint plays different character than Harry Callahan. The basic plot about, this film, is more about a psychopath killer who stalks Hollywood stars including the director and making his own movies. The film does have a plot wholes, like the killer was revealed by the end of the movie and his motives. Just trough whole movie the actor David Hunt is shown by the end of the movie. This great last chapter in the career of Inspector Harry Callahan can not be missed! You have got to check out the remote controlled car chase...reminiscent of that great Sunday drive scene in BULLITT, with Steve McQueen! Look for the great Jim Carrey acts to GUNS N' ROSES' Welcome To The Jungle, as a junkie rock star...side splitting stuff!! Eastwood delivers the goods in his last appearance as the San Francisco cop who took care of the bad guys...HIS WAY!! BANG...with that .44 Magnum Smith & Wesson hand-cannon!! Be sure to add this movie to your collection. I got the DIRTY HARRY 5 film collection on Blu-ray !!

From the other viewers out there, the scenes that they're pining over the most include the break-in at the CIA headquarters and the chase scene at the Chunnel. These fans think that those two scenes are the reasons for seeing this movie. And though they are correct in that perspective that they are memorable scenes, but that's not the only reasons why I like Mission Impossible. In fact there are far more better reasons why I like this movie a lot. Why do I enjoy this movie so much you may ask? Well for starters let's start with the leading character Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise). Unlike James Bond, Hunt refrains from being a spontaneous trigger-happy spy, who boozes on martini's and sleeps around with any female cohort who aligns with him. In this movie, he only handles a gun just one time, but never opens fire with it. It's a shame that John Woo who took over as a direction after this one had to go in that direction in the sequel. The top dog in the Impossible Mission Force (IMF) Ethan's fight plans are smart and methodical rather than casual and slick. He doesn't just randomly kills people one by one. Another characteristic I found so attached to Ethan Hunt was his decency towards female co-workers like Claire Phelps (Emmanuelle Beart) who goes as far as respects the fact that she is a married lady who happens to be married to his boss Jim Phelps (Jon Voight). In fact this spy movie doesn't have any sexual activity provided in this movie which makes it all the more refreshing. And these idiosyncrasies plus the precarious situation he's been put in, Ethan Hunt succeeds in being a relatively likable character. I'm only just observing the heart of the movie.Many people have blasted this film for being overbearingly convoluted, but that's a misnomer. If you have meagre attention spans, you may not like a film of this magnitude or those who were expecting a plethora of exciting flashy thrills or action effects. The film's intentions are for us as a viewer to be involved with the character\/s and follow through within each scene. All the scenes, set-pieces and props all flow in a very immaculate perspective. Being antsy to watch something wow will likely never happen here. You feel like part of the action with Ethan and when things start to unfold, you'll react just like the way Ethan does.What were my favourite scenes in Mission Impossible? Well as much as I agree with the Chunnel chase as being very exciting, I thought the best scenes were his interactions with Phelps in the final scenes. It was Kittredge. Phelps was so convincing, and we all know Ethan knows that's far from the truth. We see him summarizing all the events from the Prague mission in his mind. It's not that easy to contradict someone like Phelps because he's Ethan's superior. Then he asks this esoteric question, Why..Jim Why? Which translates to Why would Kittridge do it, when really the question is why would YOU do it?It's the more deeper content of Mission Impossible that make this movie all the more special. This movie is not the all style and no substance that most viewers have complained about. But to hell with them, I won't let them deprive me from enjoying it. Even after 20 years, this movie never gets old. If anyone wishes to disagree with me feel free, but your opinions will not change my opinion about this movie.

And though they are correct in that perspective that they are memorable scenes, but that's not the only reasons why I like Mission Impossible. In fact there are far more better reasons why I like this movie a lot. Why do I enjoy this movie so much you may ask? Well for starters let's start with the leading character Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise). Unlike James Bond, Hunt refrains from being a spontaneous trigger-happy spy, who boozes on martini's and sleeps around with any female cohort who aligns with him. In this movie, he only handles a gun just one time, but never opens fire with it. It's a shame that John Woo who took over as a direction after this one had to go in that direction in the sequel. The top dog in the Impossible Mission Force (IMF) Ethan's fight plans are smart and methodical rather than casual and slick. He doesn't just randomly kills people one by one. Another characteristic I found so attached to Ethan Hunt was his decency towards female co-workers like Claire Phelps (Emmanuelle Beart) who goes as far as respects the fact that she is a married lady who happens to be married to his boss Jim Phelps (Jon Voight). In fact this spy movie doesn't have any sexual activity provided in this movie which makes it all the more refreshing. And these idiosyncrasies plus the precarious situation he's been put in, Ethan Hunt succeeds in being a relatively likable character. I'm only just observing the heart of the movie.Many people have blasted this film for being overbearingly convoluted, but that's a misnomer. If you have meagre attention spans, you may not like a film of this magnitude or those who were expecting a plethora of exciting flashy thrills or action effects. The film's intentions are for us as a viewer to be involved with the character\/s and follow through within each scene. All the scenes, set-pieces and props all flow in a very immaculate perspective. Being antsy to watch something wow will likely never happen here. You feel like part of the action with Ethan and when things start to unfold, you'll react just like the way Ethan does.What were my favourite scenes in Mission Impossible? Well as much as I agree with the Chunnel chase as being very exciting, I thought the best scenes were his interactions with Phelps in the final scenes. It was Kittredge. Phelps was so convincing, and we all know Ethan knows that's far from the truth. We see him summarizing all the events from the Prague mission in his mind. It's not that easy to contradict someone like Phelps because he's Ethan's superior. Then he asks this esoteric question, Why..Jim Why? Which translates to Why would Kittridge do it, when really the question is why would YOU do it?It's the more deeper content of Mission Impossible that make this movie all the more special. This movie is not the all style and no substance that most viewers have complained about. But to hell with them, I won't let them deprive me from enjoying it. Even after 20 years, this movie never gets old. If anyone wishes to disagree with me feel free, but your opinions will not change my opinion about this movie.

It's asphalt jungle music all the way, hard and merciless in its ruthlessly importuning rough disharmonics and nightmare style (with a few exceptions for a change), and Sinatra is even convincing as a failed drummer.

The fourth installment of Dirty Harry series is one of the most astonish best and greatest Eastwood's masterpiece! I don't care what anyone say's I love this movie to death. It has the greatest and the most finest action in the 80's from Clint Eastwood. This movie is even miles way better than The Enforcer! This movie is a bad ass! Harry's line Go ahead, make my day is one of the most memorable praise since Dirty Harry (1971). A long to discover that Dirty Harry is Batman! Why can't they make bad ass action movies like this one is? I will always watch this action flick from Clint Eastwood. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts and a lot action sequences in here with a great story.The Death Wish chapter of the Dirty Harry saga and another high point in the action genre containing an amount of masculine bad ass to make anyone grow their chest hair. Also the 475 Magnum montage had me in stitches. Sudden Impact allowed Harry to interact with someone who shares his mindset of justice. Definitely the darkest of the Dirty Harry movies. In my opinion the best in the series. The rapist got raped by a .44 Auto Mag, and then by a unicorn horn. I saw that one coming in the chase scene at the carousel. Clint Eastwood was Batman back when Batman was sipping' martinis and dancing in Studio 54. The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments (I counted TEN all-star ones during my last viewing), and they're evenly spaced through the movie. Great acting and a plot worthy of the title character. Great cinematography. What else can I say buy it you will not be disappointed. This has to be one of Eastwood's best movie. Okay they are all good, but this one will make your day!The Dirty Harry films were in hiatus for 7.years, since no one wanted to make a Dirty Harry, Clint Eastwood made a fourth installment with a bad ass action film ever! Inspector Dirty Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) carries his Smith & Wesson Model 29 .44 Magnum as his sidearm in the film. He is first seen pulling it in the coffee shop and saying what is one of the most famous movie lines in history. The S&W is used until it is kicked into a curb drain by Mick (Paul Drake). He then uses his AMC Auto Mag Pistol in .44 AMP as a replacement. This is different style of Harry using different weapon by the end of the movie. Sudden Impact is the fourth installment in the Dirty Harry film franchise and the only Dirty Harry film to be directed by Clint Eastwood himself. Eastwood returns as Inspector Dirty Harry Callahan, who visits a small Northern California city while on leave from the department and finds himself encountering a woman (Sondra Locke) with a vendetta against some of the town's citizens. The 1983 sequel also is the sequel where Eastwood utters the immortal line Go ahead, make my day, while holding his Smith & Wesson Model 29. Sudden Impact also made popular the use of the .44 Magnum AMP Auto Mag Model 180. This is the basic plot of the movie, it is a revenge flick about a rape victim who murderous spree of revenge puts his own ideas of justice to the test! I grew up with this movie and I still love it, even tough this flick was really dark, Sondra Locke played in it, Clint Eastwood's girlfriend at the time. They made many movies together including The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), The Gauntlet (1977), Every Which Way But Loose (1978) and Any Which Way You Can. Sudden Impact (1983) was the last movie Sondra made with Clint Eastwood together. I think Clint did a terrific job of directing and producing his last and the only Dirty Harry movie.

The 1983 sequel also is the sequel where Eastwood utters the immortal line Go ahead, make my day, while holding his Smith & Wesson Model 29. Sudden Impact also made popular the use of the .44 Magnum AMP Auto Mag Model 180. This is the basic plot of the movie, it is a revenge flick about a rape victim who murderous spree of revenge puts his own ideas of justice to the test! I grew up with this movie and I still love it, even tough this flick was really dark, Sondra Locke played in it, Clint Eastwood's girlfriend at the time. They made many movies together including The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), The Gauntlet (1977), Every Which Way But Loose (1978) and Any Which Way You Can. Sudden Impact (1983) was the last movie Sondra made with Clint Eastwood together. I think Clint did a terrific job of directing and producing his last and the only Dirty Harry movie. I still prefer Dirty Harry and Magnum Force as two of the best movies, but this is my third best movie of Dirty Harry and Clint Eastwood. Sudden Impact is a 1983 American action film and the fourth film in the Dirty Harry series, directed by Clint Eastwood (making it the only Dirty Harry film to be directed by Eastwood himself), and starring Eastwood and Sondra Locke.10\/10 Grade Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio Warner Bros., Malpaso Company, Starring Clint Eastwood, Sondra Locke Director Clint Eastwood Producer Clint Eastwood Screenplay Joseph Stinson Story Earl E.

Like Stanley Kubrick, Francis Ford Coppola re-energized and, to a degree, reinvented a basic Hollywood pulp fiction action-entertainment genre, using it as a vehicle for the high artistic ambitions of a post-New Wave film auteur. Within his narrower focus on 20th century American civilization (as opposed to Kubrick's philosophical speculations on human evolution), Coppola shapes the story of the Corleone Mafia family into an epic\/satiric vision of American business, government, justice, and moral decline. The Godfather's brilliantly constructed opening sequence, the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter, not only establishes the Don's character, the nature of his organization, the role of family and Sicilian tradition in his world, and the character of his sons (three natural and one adopted), but also establishes the relationship between the Don's world and legitimate society. For instance, the film's opening words are those of Bonasera, a petitioner for a wedding favor, whose voice over a dark screen first asserts the American Dream, I believe in America. America has made my fortune, and then turns to disillusioned contradiction for justice, we must go to Don Corleone.Numerous subsequent lines of dialog establish literal or metaphorical connections between the criminal underworld and social institutions. Some of the most memorable ones include My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator.Now we have the unions, we have the gambling; and they're the best things to have. But narcotics is a thing of the future. And if we don't get a piece of that action, we risk everything we have. I mean not now, but ten years from now. It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business. And most famously of all I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. The film's title refers to two godfathers, the original Don Corleone and his youngest son - and ultimate successor - Michael. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Corleone, for which he was awarded a Best Actor Academy Award, balances the Don's subtly counter-pointed functions as beloved, grandfatherly patriarch and fearsome, brutal crime boss. Yet Michael, as the character most centrally and significantly affected by the film's plot and played with a brilliance equaling Brando's by a then unknown Al Pacino, is the principal protagonist.At the wedding, Michael's centrality is signaled by the Don's frantic call, Where's Michael? We are not taking the picture without Michael! A World War II hero still in decorated uniform, Michael is meanwhile busy differentiating himself from his family to his girl friend and future second wife, Kay (Diane Keaton). Luca Brasi held a gun to the band leader's head, he relates, and my father assured him that either his signature or his brains would be on the release. That's my family Kay. It's not me. Michael's initial disinterest in Mafia activities is reinforced by his adoring father who envisions him as Senator Corleone or Governor Corleone not as his successor. That role is reserved for his hot-headed eldest son, Sonny (James Caan). But, of course, events conspire to suck Michael in - and to keep sucking him in right through Godfather III - the assassination attempt on his father, Michael's coolly murderous response, the car bomb meant for him that kills his first wife, the Sicilian beauty Apollonia (aptly named for the god of sun light), the riddled body of his brother Sonny. Inevitably, a morally darkened Michael emerges at the end of the film, one who outdoes his father in guile and ruthlessness and whose final brutal and deceitful acts in Godfather I seal his doom as a Macbeth-like villainous tragic hero.Shot mainly on location in various New York City locales, The Godfather spans a ten- year post World War II period. A multitude of props, costumes, and pop culture artifacts arranged by the film's art director, Warren Clyner, and production designer, Dean Tavoularis, lend a rich sense of historical authenticity to the film's mise en scene. Moreover, the film's lighting by brilliant cinematographer Gordon (prince of darkness) Willis, contributes greatly to both the film's realism and its thematic symbolism. Compare, for instance, the use of extremely dark, shadowy, color desaturated interior scenes &#x96; especially in the Don's home office &#x96; with the brightly lit, vivaciously colored outdoor wedding scene or the sun-drenched, romanticized Sicilian landscape.The Godfather is edited in the classic Hollywood invisible style, subordinating technique to the needs of narrative and visual continuity. But the film is expertly edited nonetheless. In particular one might note the stunning use of multiple parallel editing that occurs in one of the film's last scenes the assassination of the other crime family heads, elaborately planned to coincide with Michael's participation in the baptism of sister Connie's child. Likewise, The Godfather's soundtrack is a memorable combination of diegetic period music (Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas) and a lush, operatic original score composed by one of the greatest film music composers, Nino Rota (a frequent Fellini collaborator as in 8 1\/2).With The Godfather and its even more ambitious sequel, Coppola pushed the classic gangster film in the direction of high art and released it once and for all from the moralistic grip of the Hays Code, which arose in the 1930s in large part as a response to the romanticizing of criminals found in such early examples of the gangster genre as Scarface, Little Cesar, and Public Enemy. Not only did the code regulate the degree and nature of sexual and violent imagery in all films, but it also specifically required that criminals be portrayed as morally repulsive social deviants and that plots involving them be resolved with the implicit or explicit lesson that crime did not pay. Fortunately for American popular culture The Godfather radically rewrote the rulebook and paved the way for a generation's-worth of gangster masterpieces ranging from the Scarface remake to Pulp Fiction to The Sopranos.

As to be expected from an ex-MONTY PYTHON member, this is bizarre and unusual stuff that demands concentration, and a truly unique piece of work. At its heart, the film is a black comedy that mocks modern society - by setting it in the future, Gilliam is able to exaggerate the flaws of '80s society and follow them through to an extreme but logical conclusion - as well as having all kinds of outlandish humour to enjoy. Elements of adventure, action, romance and horror are mixed expertly into the proceedings and every minute of this two hour-plus film is gripping.At its heart, the film is a satirical adaptation of Orwell's 1984, except far more complex - multiple viewings are demanding to fully appreciate Gilliam's masterpiece. Everything about the film is flawless - the music, the acting, the visuals, the twists and turns of the story. Sitting here now, a day after viewing the film, I can't think of a single fault with it. At first the running time put me off (I'm not a fan of long films at all) but it couldn't be shortened in any way. Animator Gilliam has created some unique and often stunning visuals for his movie.

The cityscape couldn't be any bleaker - a grey mess, full of rotting rubbish in corners and brainwashed people going through the exact same motions every single day. The humour comes frequent, ranging from in-jokes with the characters to blackly humorous stuff (the coffin\/corpse sequence is very dark indeed, but hilarious) and is always spot on.Jonathan Pryce is a revelation as Sam Lowry, and his performance reminds me of John Cleese's turn in the much smaller-scale CLOCKWISE - that of a man gradually driven out of his mind by circumstance until he ends up a lunatic. The supporting cast of British veterans is wonderful, with cameos from the likes of Jim Broadbent, Bob Hoskins, Michael Palin, Peter Vaughan, Ian Richardson and Ian Holm.

Did they survive and did some of them continue their sinister human experiments that were started in the concentration camps? While I think MARATHON MAN has the edge in terms of being an enjoyable, all-time classic, THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL is still a very good, taut thriller that just happens to have an excellent ensemble cast to boot.Two old-time heavyweights are pitted against each other here a virtually unrecognisable Gregory Peck as sinister Nazi scientist Dr Josef Mengele, and Laurence Olivier as the doddery old Jew hot on his tail. The two men don't meet until their climatic showdown, but what a treat it is when they do! Throughout the film, both actors remind us why they were considered worldwide stars. Peck is utterly repulsive as the ruthless Nazi, but Olivier steals the film as the sympathetic Nazi hunter in a reversal of the role he played in MARATHON MAN.The film is slow paced, but remains engaging throughout, and the suspense never ceases. There's globetrotting action, assassins and a scary storyline including cloning as well as Jeremy Black playing an extremely creepy child. This is an unashamedly old-fashioned film that doesn't rely on fight scenes or car chases to tell the story, and here intelligent scripting and fine cinematography win out over the usual humdrum staples. The supporting cast is remarkable James Mason as a Nazi, Denholm Elliott as a shifty bureaucrat, Steve Guttenberg surprisingly good in one of his earliest roles as a tragic investigator, along with the likes of Walter Gotell, Michael Gough, Wolfgang Preiss and even a couple of British actresses in brief roles Prunella Scales and Linda Hayden.The last twenty minutes or so are absolutely riveting as the story comes to a head, and it finishes in an extremely satisfying way too.

While I think MARATHON MAN has the edge in terms of being an enjoyable, all-time classic, THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL is still a very good, taut thriller that just happens to have an excellent ensemble cast to boot.Two old-time heavyweights are pitted against each other here a virtually unrecognisable Gregory Peck as sinister Nazi scientist Dr Josef Mengele, and Laurence Olivier as the doddery old Jew hot on his tail. The two men don't meet until their climatic showdown, but what a treat it is when they do! Throughout the film, both actors remind us why they were considered worldwide stars. Peck is utterly repulsive as the ruthless Nazi, but Olivier steals the film as the sympathetic Nazi hunter in a reversal of the role he played in MARATHON MAN.The film is slow paced, but remains engaging throughout, and the suspense never ceases. There's globetrotting action, assassins and a scary storyline including cloning as well as Jeremy Black playing an extremely creepy child. This is an unashamedly old-fashioned film that doesn't rely on fight scenes or car chases to tell the story, and here intelligent scripting and fine cinematography win out over the usual humdrum staples. The supporting cast is remarkable James Mason as a Nazi, Denholm Elliott as a shifty bureaucrat, Steve Guttenberg surprisingly good in one of his earliest roles as a tragic investigator, along with the likes of Walter Gotell, Michael Gough, Wolfgang Preiss and even a couple of British actresses in brief roles Prunella Scales and Linda Hayden.The last twenty minutes or so are absolutely riveting as the story comes to a head, and it finishes in an extremely satisfying way too. As chilling a film as any horror, THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL is a fine example of the thriller genre at its best.

Although, I didn't quite get the whole Mufasa death till I was maybe 7 or 8. Now Every time I re-watch it, it makes me cry. It also depresses me on how Simba thinks it's all his fault. But then he grows up and Nala finds him. She tells him what Scar has done to Pride Rock,Simba becomes all fierce and sexy. Then Simba goes back with Nala and brings Timon and Pumbaa with him. The diversion that Timon and Pumbaa create is hilarious. If I could watch it on VHS again, I would. Also if you're looking for a Disney film for a younger child, I would suggest this one.

Not just that, I also had a 4x3 foot cardboard stand from the local video shop that stood proudly in the corner of my room.I also had a miniature cardboard display next to a 5 foot RoboCop, a 4 foot Crocodile Dundee and a 6 foot Robin Williams from Good Morning Vietnam.Liking this movie was a given, I had stacks of Fangoria magazines piled next to my graphic novels that were cushioned next go my porn collection. Comics, gore, porn.... everything a growing teenage boy needs, but why is it that I can't remember anything from this movie, yet I could recite lines from the original verbatim?25 years on I got the Blu-Ray of the first 3 ROTLD movies and decided to spend a whole Sunday watching them back to back with hot winter food and alcohol, but 5 minutes into this....effort, it all came flooding back. It's appalling.I'd like to say it's like a lifeless corpse of a movie in some ironic attempt at thematic humour but it's just a pale imitation, a copy bereft of charm or wit, a typical studio failure to replicate an original premise that had vibrancy, heart and soul. From the awful staged sequences of the badly directed kids 'fighting' at the beginning.Cringe-worthy music that sounded like it was taken from a TV movie sound library.Shocking editing, as the 'gas' creeping through the graveyard is blatantly shot on 2 completely different film stocks and it just looks woefully poor. Yes, the original movie suffered from certain budget restraints and I could write a list of deficiencies as long as my arm but that makes it all the more memorable and charming and re-watchable. All of these years later, watching Return Of The Living Dead again, just hours ago was fun filled, laugh a minute entertainment. This film is everything the first movie isn't and everything we dread about sequels.I have no idea what Ken Weiderhorn thought he was doing but pissing on the legacy of a great concept. I switched this film off 15 minutes.I guess I must have done the same when I was a kid, before tearing the poster off my wall and ripping the cardboard stand to pieces.All of these things, utterly forgettable.
