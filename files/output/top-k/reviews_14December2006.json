This film, depending on your point-of-view, can be considered a masterpiece of suspense, a camp classic, or the worst film you've ever seen. Since it's so difficult for me to take Branagh seriously, this film is definitely a camp classic to my eyes. Despite some gripping moments here and there, the film contained so many clichés of the genre that the plot was less plausible than a Scooby Doo episode.The film is enjoyable and some plot elements are somewhat atypical of the mystery genre, but Branagh's acting and directing style are so melodramatic that the whole film seems like some sort of parody. Here Branagh relies on a stereotypical American accent and a poor German accent in the dual role of an LA gumshoe of the present and a German composer of the past. His American accent is so exaggerated that he sounds like a Canadian in several scenes! His German accent sounds like an Englishman struggling to do an imitation of Austrian actor Anton Walbrook. And, of course, there's the usual Kenny Branagh facial expressions that are straight out of Saturday morning cartoons&#151;if you've ever wanted to see Ken get kicked in the groin and see the reaction on his face, then this is your chance.The other cast members are equally hilarious despite the display of their talents in other and better films. Emma Thompson grits her teeth and rolls her wide eyes whenever she's in terror as Branagh's love interest. Derek Jacobi delivers a suave performance that's reminiscent of Claude Rains in NOTORIOUS (1946)&#133;but without Rains' subtle acting. And one scene, Andy Garcia appears in old age makeup that's hokey enough to make him resemble a Muppet. And, of course, special mention goes to Robin Williams, who delivers some hilarious one-liners despite his intentionally serious acting in the film.The plot is ludicrous&#133;but I won't spend my time writing it down. And the film's finale is so contrived and silly that you'll be experiencing laughs instead of thrills. Branagh's directing style goes overboard here, delivering some of the hammiest acting I've ever seen in a film that didn't star Bette Davis. Wait until you see what happens to Derek Jacobi! I almost died laughing.However, Patrick Doyle's music score is very good. Since Branagh seemingly attempted to imitate the incomparable directing style of Alfred Hitchcock, Doyle succeeds in delivering a music score that Bernard Herrmann would have been proud of. Special mention should also go to Matthew F. Leonetti's cinematography, which relies on the use of stark black-and-white for the film's flashback sequences.But Branagh is no Hitchcock. This film is even more enjoyable on DVD listen to Kenneth Branagh's stuffy audio commentary and hear how many times he gives a high opinion of this film&#133;and of himself. If you can't take Kenneth Branagh seriously, then the DVD is recommended viewing. Watch, enjoy, and laugh.The film is followed by a sequel, DEAD AGAIN AGAIN. ;-) ","genre":null},{"date":"14 December 2006","score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Always an actor\/producer\/director who relied on theatrical elements in his films, Kenneth Branagh is a man that I can't take seriously.

I first saw it back in 1981, when it was something of a phenomenon and a refreshing change. It was an old fashioned feel-good movie that looked good, told an uplifting story and had a brilliant score by Vangelis.It's essentially about two British athletes and their quest for gold at the 1924 Paris Olympics. It tries to explain what drove them and like all good sports movies you become a fan and part of their inevitable success. The film is based on real events but Colin Welland's script doesn't let the facts stand in the way of a good story. In his defence, the liberties taken probably help the story and add to the drama.Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) is an ambitious sprinter at Cambridge University who is desperate win. Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) is a Scottish rugby international and a devoted Christian who becomes a missionary in China after the games. Liddell believes that God made him fast for a purpose so he gives up rugby and focuses on sprinting. His sister Jennie (Cheryl Campbell) believes that his running is a silly waste of time. Both runners compete against each other in 1923 and Liddell comes out on top. Over the winter Abrahams hires a professional coach Sam Mussabini (Ian Holm) to help him prepare for the games. Meanwhile Harold meets and falls in love with Sybil Gordon (Alice Krige) a light opera singer. On the eve of the games Liddell discovers that the heats of the 100 meters are being held on Sunday and switches to the 400 meters. All the actors give excellent performances, but Ben Cross and Krige are exceptionally good. Welland's script contains a long list of historical inaccuracies. Liddell knew months before the games that his heats would be on a Sunday. In the film, Abrahams, who was a Jew, claims that he is being discriminated against. Many people dispute this. The story claims that Mussabini was desperate to coach an Olympic champion for the first time. However, he also trained Reggie Walker (winner of the 100 meters in 1908) and Albert Hill (winner of the 800 and 1,500 meters in 1920). Welland creates new characters like Lord Andrew Lindsay (Nigel Havers)and omits Douglas Lowe who attended Cambridge with Abrahams and won the 800 meters in Paris. I could go on. The film came at the right time when the world was ready for noble heroes. The film still retains some magic and is well worth watching.

This film contains many of the Chaplin's usual comedy numbers. In fact, the boxing scene in this film is even better than those from Cinderella Man. However, I think that this film has a very serious message behind all of the comedy.Chaplin was never a man who feared making social commentary. This is more obvious in films like The Great Dictator and Modern Times. Even though City Lights messages are a little more subtle, I think they are still present. The film touches on everything from poverty to wealth and even race.I think the main social commentary in the film can be found in it's views on wealth. The film actually opens up with the city unveiling a large monument. To their surprise, when the pull the curtain the homeless Tramp (Chaplin) is sleeping on the lap of the statue. His presence is seen by the crowd as an unwelcome blemish on the face of their monument. Physical comedy aside, this scene sets the tone for the rest of the film. The whole concept is how the rich want to ignore the poor and pretend they do not exist. This is made completely clear in the relationship between Chaplin and the eccentric millionaire. In fact, when the first meet the millionaire is attempting to kill himself. He is actually saved by a homeless man telling him that the birds will sing tomorrow. This total irony is the kind of tool that Chaplin uses to illustrate his point. Another aspect of the this relationship that illustrates the same point is the fact that when the rich man is drunk, Chaplin is his best friend. However, when he sobers up he wants nothing to do with him. He even pretends not to know him some times. This shows in no uncertain terms, that Chaplin saw the rich as being afraid to help the poor. In fact, one of the only people that will actually talk to Charlie is a blind girl who sells flowers. This seems like a typical screen romance. However, when you delve deeper I think that you can see it is not. Through out the film, I think you can confuse this relationship as puppy love. Then as the plot unfolds a couple of apparent thoughts surface. The blind girl actually thinks that Charlie's character is a millionaire. I think that in hind sight it is easy to see that the more Charlie pretends to be rich, the more she likes him. In fact, this can perhaps be seen in the ending sequence. The girl now able to see and the owner of a whole flower store thanks to the money that Charlie provides is always waiting on him to arrive. The catch is, that she has never seen Charlie before. At one point a rich man walks in, and the girl gets a look on her face that shows she thinks that her prince has arrived. When it isn't him, she says she hopes he comes soon. Then ironically, a totally beaten down Tramp walks by her store window. From inside the store, she actually laughs at him when local paper boys pick on him. Then we he sees her and is obviously madly in love, she taunts him even further. In fact, when she does realize that this tramp is her knight in shining armor comes the clincher. The girl's face shows not love or gratitude. There is no hug or kiss, for the man that saved her. Only a disappointed look and her saying that now she can see. I think that this more than any other point in the film is where the message is really hammered home. When Charlie's only friend now has some money, and sees him for the poor person that he is she is saddened. It is really quite a dark thought. I mean this is a man, who got beaten up in a boxing match and even shoveled fecal matter off the street just to try and help his love pay her rent. I think this sad thought is one that Chaplin hoped would open the audience's eyes to this problem.Besides the obvious economic views in the movie, we have other examples of social commentary. The boxing scene has a very interesting one to me. Not only does it show these boxing people turning the poor into punching bags, so they can fill their arena but there is a race issue as well. In this scene the black boxer is shown not only as superstitious, but he actually gets pummeled by a white boxer. Then there is also a major homosexual under current in this scene as well. Charlie is shown as seemingly gay in the locker room. He makes gay gestures as well as faces towards his opponent. If you think this is not true, then why does the man change his pants behind a curtain? I think the fact that Charlie and the black boxer are shown as outcast in the locker room is some kind of commentary on the thoughts of the time. In fact, the homosexual theme is also prevalent with the millionaire and Charlie. Always hugging and drinking. At one point Charlie actually wakes up in bed with the millionaire. I think the film at times shows the desperate Charlie as a male prostitute to the millionaire. I am not sure if this is what Charlie meant to do, but it is definitely something to look at when you view the film.In closing, this film is just as much a masterpiece as everything else that Chaplin has done. The comedy and commentary mix together to form one very striking and memorable film. I think that is why is is still held in such high regards, even to this day.

In this scene the black boxer is shown not only as superstitious, but he actually gets pummeled by a white boxer. Then there is also a major homosexual under current in this scene as well. Charlie is shown as seemingly gay in the locker room. He makes gay gestures as well as faces towards his opponent. If you think this is not true, then why does the man change his pants behind a curtain? I think the fact that Charlie and the black boxer are shown as outcast in the locker room is some kind of commentary on the thoughts of the time. In fact, the homosexual theme is also prevalent with the millionaire and Charlie. Always hugging and drinking. At one point Charlie actually wakes up in bed with the millionaire. I think the film at times shows the desperate Charlie as a male prostitute to the millionaire. I am not sure if this is what Charlie meant to do, but it is definitely something to look at when you view the film.In closing, this film is just as much a masterpiece as everything else that Chaplin has done. The comedy and commentary mix together to form one very striking and memorable film. I think that is why is is still held in such high regards, even to this day.

This is in terms of the confusion it almost inevitably generates with anyone who watches it. I am talking specifically about how and which machines attack people.For example, you may find yourself asking how could that soda machine really do that? Or, why do some vehicles chase after people while others are still obedient to their operators? Not to mention several scenes where a victim could have easily avoided being killed even if only four out of their five senses were working properly.Unfortunately, these aren't the only details overlooked in the movie. The text before the closing credits explaining what events supposedly happen later create more questions, including rehashing the whole why does this machine attack but not this one question.But beyond the lack of explanation and logic, there are other goofs that don't take a very keen eye to see. One involves an old Mack truck chasing a car and driving off an embankment to do the whole car-off-a-cliff exploding thing. This is cheesy enough, but, in this case, the truck seems to start exploding a little prematurely, not to mention the fall doesn't seem particularly far.Another point worth making is that Maximum Overdrive is not so much the scary variety of horror movie as it is the gory variety. So keep this in mind as well as the fact that pets and children aren't spared from the onslaught of King's machines.As far as the acting goes, it varies significantly by character, bordering somewhere along bearable and believable. Some of the comic relief is actually good.More on the plus side, the idea of machines coming alive and destroying humanity is thought-provoking to say the least, especially when one considers everyday appliances and automobiles attacking as opposed to more militaristic creations such as those in the Terminator films. Given the considerable expansion of technology that has occurred in our lives since this film was made, a modern adaptation could be very promising as long as some sort of logic behind what types of machines can attack is developed.Also, the AC\/DC soundtrack really fits this film quite well.In the end, if you can stand the gore (I personally recommend watching a television version which is bad enough) and overlook or laugh at the fairly obvious absence of logic, this movie is worth a look.

In this country for only a short time, director Hitchcock's set pieces recreate the cities of London and Amsterdam in a tale of spies and traitors operating under the guise of a Universal Peace Party. It's chairman Fisher (Herbert Marshall) orchestrates the kidnapping of Dutch partner Van Meer (Albert Bassermann), who has committed the details of a secret peace agreement to memory. Clause 27 turns out to be a classic Hitchcock maguffin, a device planted in the story to rouse the interest of the viewer, though it's details are never revealed. In fact, it's not necessary to do so, because the film's sleight of hand diverts us to assassination attempts, a Dutch windmill hideout for the villains and a harrowing plane crash into the ocean before it's all over.The intrigue moves along nicely with Joel McCrae as Morning Globe reporter Johnny Jones, who finds himself in the thick of things in more ways than one. He gets lured into the espionage drama after he witnesses what looks like the assassination of ambassador Van Meer, though by this time he's also becoming romantically involved with Carol Fisher (Laraine Day). She's the daughter of the mastermind behind the spy ring, but having grown up British, her loyalty is staunchly pro Brit and anti war.Hitch builds suspense in the film on any number of levels, and each time it works, even when he goes for an 'in your face' moment like Rowley's (Edmund Gwenn) attempt to push Johnny from the top of the cathedral. You know instinctively that Jones\/Haverstock can't be dead, yet you maintain ever the slightest doubt until you see him again in the very next scene. But for sheer terror, the scenes of the ocean plane crash survivors scrambling onto the wreckage is about the most surreal and insane piece of film making ever, made all the more terrifying if you think of yourself being there. Personally, I can't even imagine confronting a horror like that, much less hanging on long enough to survive.Though not remembered as one of Hitchcock's better known films, the movie was nominated for six Oscars in it's day, ironically pitted against Hitch's first American film Rebecca which won Best Picture in 1941. Though it may seem somewhat dated today, one can still have a good time with the movie by glossing over the less believable elements and riding it out for the mystery and adventure.

I think it is that none of the deaths at the end really matter. A sniveling coward is shot to keep him from murdering another man; then two bitter, greedy men with an old feud kill each other. Was it a shame that any of these men died? And what happens to the feud? Here's suggestions for how it could have been better. First, give the Major, the gentlemanly cattleman, an admirable background -- hero in the Civil War, admired civic leader some years ago, whatever. When McKay, the sea captain (Peck), meets the Major's daughter in the east, he knows of the Major's admirable history. People in Baltimore praised the Major to him, and that's how he met the daughter. But years ago, after the Major came out West to start this ranch, he started to turn small, greedy, vindictive. Maybe his wife died, maybe there was some other disappointment. He has taken out his bitterness on the Burl Ives character, allowing a minor annoyance or misunderstanding some years ago to fester and grow. Ives has reacted with hurt and bitterness in return -- he knows the slight, whatever it was, doesn't justify this animosity, so he attributes it to snobbery. With this back-story provided to the audience -- it would only take a few lines to put it into the film, maybe delivered by a couple of people at the engagement party -- both old men become more complex, more understandable, more tragic in their confrontation. Then the movie plays out just as it is, until the end, the showdown in Blanco canyon to rescue the Jean Simmons character. The Major's daughter, who has always really been in love with her father, rides out after them, thinking that the captured woman, when rescued, may well want the company of a woman (the subtext here being, if Simmons has been raped during the kidnapping, she will need a woman to be there after the rescue). She arrives just as the final show-down between her father and Ives is about to happen. With her usual immature frontier desire that men fight for honor, she urges her father on to kill Ives -- and, of course, her father not only kills Ives, but is killed. As she is hysterical over his body -- she was too immature to really imagine that her father could die -- Heston sees it, and realizes that he doesn't love or want her any more -- he sees she is in love with her father, and also, he sees she is immature, and has the vicious streak her father had, and so he sees she is really a person he no longer wants to love. She sees the look on Heston's face, and then she sees McKay (Peck) with Simmons obviously in love, and suddenly she realizes that she has lost Peck, lost her father, and lost Heston, all at once. In the space of just a day or two, she has gone from having three men in love with her to having no-one in love with her -- and she herself has been the cause of losing all three loves. We see the bitterness harden in her and we realize that she, the heiress of her father's ranch, will continue his bitter reign, bitter against both Ives' family, and Peck & Simmons. Then bring Ives' younger son into the scene, the young man who will inherit Ives' ranch, upset that his father is dead, blaming the Major, blaming the Major's daughter who urged the Major to kill Ives his father, and blaming Peck and Simmons for the earlier death of his cowardly older brother. As the movie ends we see Peck and Simmons united, which feels wonderful, but we also see that the animosity between the clans is going to continue into the next generation, with both warring sides also blaming Peck and Simmons, the ones in the middle -- literally in the middle, since their Big Muddy ranch is the source of water for the cattle of both clans. Something like this would provide the movie with the emotional pay-off that the movie lacks as it is. It needs to be tragic that the Major dies as he does, an admirable men destroyed for nothing due to a vindictive flaw in his character. It needs to be tragic that his daughter goes from having three men who love her, to none. And it needs to be tragic that the feud will live on into the next generation. Or, alternatively, the movie needs to show that the feud will end with these deaths -- that the Major's daughter has learned, and matured, and that Ives' heir has also learned and matured. One or the other outcome needs to be in the movie. Ignoring the next generation, leaving open what happens to the feud, leaves an emotional hole in the story. Sometimes I read a comment on a book or film and it says The story would have been better if X, Y, or Z had happened in the story. My reaction to these kind of comments is, hey, it's a work of fiction, not a fact history. Just because the author didn't think of those improvements is no reason why you can't treat the story as having been told in that better way. You can act as though the story had in fact been told the way you think would be better -- just imagine for yourself that it was told that way. So for those of who who like the changes I just proposed, try imagining that this ending was actually in an alternative version of the movie you saw. If that gives you the emotional experience you seek, why not try it?

With this back-story provided to the audience -- it would only take a few lines to put it into the film, maybe delivered by a couple of people at the engagement party -- both old men become more complex, more understandable, more tragic in their confrontation. Then the movie plays out just as it is, until the end, the showdown in Blanco canyon to rescue the Jean Simmons character. The Major's daughter, who has always really been in love with her father, rides out after them, thinking that the captured woman, when rescued, may well want the company of a woman (the subtext here being, if Simmons has been raped during the kidnapping, she will need a woman to be there after the rescue). She arrives just as the final show-down between her father and Ives is about to happen. With her usual immature frontier desire that men fight for honor, she urges her father on to kill Ives -- and, of course, her father not only kills Ives, but is killed. As she is hysterical over his body -- she was too immature to really imagine that her father could die -- Heston sees it, and realizes that he doesn't love or want her any more -- he sees she is in love with her father, and also, he sees she is immature, and has the vicious streak her father had, and so he sees she is really a person he no longer wants to love. She sees the look on Heston's face, and then she sees McKay (Peck) with Simmons obviously in love, and suddenly she realizes that she has lost Peck, lost her father, and lost Heston, all at once. In the space of just a day or two, she has gone from having three men in love with her to having no-one in love with her -- and she herself has been the cause of losing all three loves. We see the bitterness harden in her and we realize that she, the heiress of her father's ranch, will continue his bitter reign, bitter against both Ives' family, and Peck & Simmons. Then bring Ives' younger son into the scene, the young man who will inherit Ives' ranch, upset that his father is dead, blaming the Major, blaming the Major's daughter who urged the Major to kill Ives his father, and blaming Peck and Simmons for the earlier death of his cowardly older brother. As the movie ends we see Peck and Simmons united, which feels wonderful, but we also see that the animosity between the clans is going to continue into the next generation, with both warring sides also blaming Peck and Simmons, the ones in the middle -- literally in the middle, since their Big Muddy ranch is the source of water for the cattle of both clans. Something like this would provide the movie with the emotional pay-off that the movie lacks as it is. It needs to be tragic that the Major dies as he does, an admirable men destroyed for nothing due to a vindictive flaw in his character. It needs to be tragic that his daughter goes from having three men who love her, to none. And it needs to be tragic that the feud will live on into the next generation. Or, alternatively, the movie needs to show that the feud will end with these deaths -- that the Major's daughter has learned, and matured, and that Ives' heir has also learned and matured. One or the other outcome needs to be in the movie. Ignoring the next generation, leaving open what happens to the feud, leaves an emotional hole in the story. Sometimes I read a comment on a book or film and it says The story would have been better if X, Y, or Z had happened in the story. My reaction to these kind of comments is, hey, it's a work of fiction, not a fact history. Just because the author didn't think of those improvements is no reason why you can't treat the story as having been told in that better way. You can act as though the story had in fact been told the way you think would be better -- just imagine for yourself that it was told that way. So for those of who who like the changes I just proposed, try imagining that this ending was actually in an alternative version of the movie you saw.

I think it is that none of the deaths at the end really matter. A sniveling coward is shot to keep him from murdering another man; then two bitter, greedy men with an old feud kill each other. Was it a shame that any of these men died? And what happens to the feud? Here's suggestions for how it could have been better. First, give the Major, the gentlemanly cattleman, an admirable background -- hero in the Civil War, admired civic leader some years ago, whatever. When McKay, the sea captain (Peck), meets the Major's daughter in the east, he knows of the Major's admirable history. People in Baltimore praised the Major to him, and that's how he met the daughter. But years ago, after the Major came out West to start this ranch, he started to turn small, greedy, vindictive. Maybe his wife died, maybe there was some other disappointment. He has taken out his bitterness on the Burl Ives character, allowing a minor annoyance or misunderstanding some years ago to fester and grow. Ives has reacted with hurt and bitterness in return -- he knows the slight, whatever it was, doesn't justify this animosity, so he attributes it to snobbery.

It has some dazzling CGI effects to complement its dark tone and breathe life into the Gothic fantasy, and wondrous cinematography to carry it out. Unfortunately, that's all it has to offer, which is a real shame, because this had the potential to be one hell (pun intended) of a movie.As a reader of Spawn comics and collector of Spawn merchandise (and affiliated McFarlane Toys products), I saw at an early age how Spawn revolutionized the comics industry with its mystical premise, graphic visuals, Heaven vs. Hell battle theme and gratuitous sex and violence, and while such gusto has been embraced by fans, this 1997 film adaptation of Todd McFarlane's popular underground comic, directed by Mark A.Z. Dippe', is rated PG-13 (subsequent home video versions were of the R-rated director's cut, which contained additional footage), the watered-down violence more cartoonish than graphic. In short, in the comic book world, Spawn is not like anything else out there.The story is that the demon Malebolgia needs fresh souls for his ever-growing army of undead soldiers to lead an eventual conquest of Earth, and then, Heaven, in what will eventually bring about Armageddon. All Malebolgia needs is a general for his army, and, Holy Lazarus, recently deceased CIA operative Al Simmons (newcomer Michael Jai White) has just the extra-crispy corpse for the job.See, Simmons was set up by his insane former employer Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen) after making a bargain with Malebolgia's go-to guy and Earthbound lieutenant, the pudgy, disgusting Clown (John Leguizamo, completely unrecognizable in his get-up), to kill Simmons so that he would be sent to Hell. While in Hell (which looks like a CGI version of a Marilyn Manson concert on steroids), Simmons makes a deal with Malebolgia to lead his army, in exchange for one last chance to see his wife Wanda Blake (Theresa Randle), who is now married to his best friend Terry Fitzgerald (D.B. Sweeney) and together the two now have a young daughter named Cyan (Sydni Beaudoin).Back on Earth and unaware that five years have passed, Simmons has a burnt-to-a-crisp visage that doesn't sit well with people not accustomed to undead soldiers from Hell. He establishes sympathetic links with the homeless denizens of alley Rat City, chiefly young Zack (Miko Hughes), and is watched over by the Godsend Cogliostro (Nicol Williamson). When Simmons's body comes out of its larval stage and transforms him into a Hellspawn, a being with an endoplasmic and invincible suit of armor, he sees his chance to use these new powers to exact vengeance on Wynn, his lethal vixen Jessica Priest (Melinda Clarke), reunite with Wanda, and seek a way to break out of his agreement with Hell.As stated earlier, Spawn is one hell of a special effects spectacle, and it looks great, but a lot goes wrong in too many places. I was dazzled to see one of my favorite superheroes on the screen nearly 10 years ago as an impressionable pre-teen. Now at 21, I am sorely disappointed by what I see today. Spawn still could have been good, even without with the full-on graphic content and Heaven & Hell mysticism of the source material. While a largely accurate reflection of the comics, it still gives more credence to my assertion that this is Spawn-lite. Presumably, studio bosses weren't keen on marketing a Hellbound superhero to the masses, so measures were probably taken to make the vehicle more accessible. (Take my advice and stick to the animated HBO miniseries.)On the plus side, Michael Jai White makes an efficient hero and this remains the actor's most well-known part. We do feel his pain (even if it seems forced at times), his quips, and overall faithful portrayal of the character. Sheen makes for a coolly sadistic madman but it's Leguizamo who steals the show. His gross-out-humor, maggot-munching portrayal of the Clown is just what takes this movie out of the dregs and into full-blown camp territory. Lastly, the soundtrack, a mix of heavy metal and techno, does have some pretty wicked sounds.It's easy to see that only core fans will want to stick with this picture. It had such a great chance to be something unlike anything else out there. With the comic book craze still in full swing in Hollywood, Spawn seems forgotten, or at the very least, sitting on the sidelines. But Spawn, to me, seems to be an example of mis-marketing, a brilliant idea gone haywire.

Unfortunately, that's all it has to offer, which is a real shame, because this had the potential to be one hell (pun intended) of a movie.As a reader of Spawn comics and collector of Spawn merchandise (and affiliated McFarlane Toys products), I saw at an early age how Spawn revolutionized the comics industry with its mystical premise, graphic visuals, Heaven vs. Hell battle theme and gratuitous sex and violence, and while such gusto has been embraced by fans, this 1997 film adaptation of Todd McFarlane's popular underground comic, directed by Mark A.Z. Dippe', is rated PG-13 (subsequent home video versions were of the R-rated director's cut, which contained additional footage), the watered-down violence more cartoonish than graphic. In short, in the comic book world, Spawn is not like anything else out there.The story is that the demon Malebolgia needs fresh souls for his ever-growing army of undead soldiers to lead an eventual conquest of Earth, and then, Heaven, in what will eventually bring about Armageddon. All Malebolgia needs is a general for his army, and, Holy Lazarus, recently deceased CIA operative Al Simmons (newcomer Michael Jai White) has just the extra-crispy corpse for the job.See, Simmons was set up by his insane former employer Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen) after making a bargain with Malebolgia's go-to guy and Earthbound lieutenant, the pudgy, disgusting Clown (John Leguizamo, completely unrecognizable in his get-up), to kill Simmons so that he would be sent to Hell. While in Hell (which looks like a CGI version of a Marilyn Manson concert on steroids), Simmons makes a deal with Malebolgia to lead his army, in exchange for one last chance to see his wife Wanda Blake (Theresa Randle), who is now married to his best friend Terry Fitzgerald (D.B. Sweeney) and together the two now have a young daughter named Cyan (Sydni Beaudoin).Back on Earth and unaware that five years have passed, Simmons has a burnt-to-a-crisp visage that doesn't sit well with people not accustomed to undead soldiers from Hell. He establishes sympathetic links with the homeless denizens of alley Rat City, chiefly young Zack (Miko Hughes), and is watched over by the Godsend Cogliostro (Nicol Williamson). When Simmons's body comes out of its larval stage and transforms him into a Hellspawn, a being with an endoplasmic and invincible suit of armor, he sees his chance to use these new powers to exact vengeance on Wynn, his lethal vixen Jessica Priest (Melinda Clarke), reunite with Wanda, and seek a way to break out of his agreement with Hell.As stated earlier, Spawn is one hell of a special effects spectacle, and it looks great, but a lot goes wrong in too many places. I was dazzled to see one of my favorite superheroes on the screen nearly 10 years ago as an impressionable pre-teen. Now at 21, I am sorely disappointed by what I see today. Spawn still could have been good, even without with the full-on graphic content and Heaven & Hell mysticism of the source material. While a largely accurate reflection of the comics, it still gives more credence to my assertion that this is Spawn-lite. Presumably, studio bosses weren't keen on marketing a Hellbound superhero to the masses, so measures were probably taken to make the vehicle more accessible. (Take my advice and stick to the animated HBO miniseries.)On the plus side, Michael Jai White makes an efficient hero and this remains the actor's most well-known part. We do feel his pain (even if it seems forced at times), his quips, and overall faithful portrayal of the character. Sheen makes for a coolly sadistic madman but it's Leguizamo who steals the show. His gross-out-humor, maggot-munching portrayal of the Clown is just what takes this movie out of the dregs and into full-blown camp territory. Lastly, the soundtrack, a mix of heavy metal and techno, does have some pretty wicked sounds.It's easy to see that only core fans will want to stick with this picture. It had such a great chance to be something unlike anything else out there. With the comic book craze still in full swing in Hollywood, Spawn seems forgotten, or at the very least, sitting on the sidelines. But Spawn, to me, seems to be an example of mis-marketing, a brilliant idea gone haywire.

We see the evil mobster Mr.Eddy showing snuff films in his house where someone apparently is murdered in it on the TV screen. Which seems to represent true images. Why not just porno, of course it makes Eddy look more menacing but is that necessary? Showing the snuff film is not an accident, it is necessary to the plot. We see Arquette with the mobster watching the snuff film on the TV late in the film. She makes films for a guy she knows kills people on film, she is embracing him and letting him have his way with her We never actually see Fred murder his wife. In fact Fred in the video before he is punched by the police Fred clearly has no weapon in his hand and is in shock. Why leave the weapon out of the video if Fred killed his wife? Given the people she was in with why isn't it a possibility that unbeknownst to her she was put in a snuff film, murdered, and then brought back to her house so as to frame the murder on Fred? Fred comes home sees the body and could have very well been forced to play in the gore by whoever was behind the camera. Tape ends up with the police, case closed. As far as Fred as a man he is obviously not a big time musician, he is playing in a small club.

The laugh they share at the beginning of the film when Arquette says she is going to 'read' when he is out tells us all. So out of the window goes the explanation that Fred and his happy wife were plodding along and suddenly he discovers she is in porno and kills his wife, Andy, and Eddy. He had to have known she was in porno and aligned with Andy and Eddy, million dollar houses don't grow on trees. That also explains why the satanic character in the film tells Fred 'You invited me into your house, it is not my custom to go where I'm not wanted'. He invited evil into his house by living with the knowledge that his wife was a professional whore, and associated with wholly evil men.

I watched The Mummy, and basically enjoyed it as an utter yarn, with one or two nit-picks (Seti I murdered by his high priest? Huh?). The thing that stuck in my craw the most was the bit about the vicious, flesh-eating scarabs. Scarabs are DUNG BEETLES! They eat dung, never live prey. Ever! They may occasionally feast on decayed vegetation and possibly even the rotted flesh of corpses, but they generally prefer the dung of livestock and are, themselves, a favorite snack of Egyptian bats. It was a minor issue and the FX were cool, so I let it slide ... sort of.I was far less forgiving with The Mummy Returns, which I turned off in disgust after about the first five minutes. The reason? Its portrayal of Anubis as a snarling, evil and dark god (I'm quoting words from the movie itself) was offensive and inaccurate, if not outright sacrilege. According to Egyptian mythology, the jackal- or dog-headed god, Anubis, was not and IS not evil, even though his alleged father, Set, might be characterized as such.For those who don't know Anubis is the Egyptian god of the dead and dying, who protects and ushers the recently deceased into the afterlife, most commonly referred to as the Underworld (not to be confused with Hell, mind you). He is at once ruler, guard and judge of who is fit and deserving to enter the utopian Underworld by a test known as the Weighing of the Heart. (Sort of the Egyptian equivalent of St. Peter.) He was spared from death as an infant by the goddess Isis and remains Her loyal companion and protector (much like the faithful family dog). He is said to have taught the art of mummification and funerary rites to the Egyptians priests. He is also viewed by some as the patron god of lost souls and orphans. Dark? Perhaps, inasmuch as death may be considered dark. But, evil? Absolutely not. And I have come across no tales of Anubis ever having had an evil army as the The Mummy Returns portrays being led by the Scorpion King. This notion is so ridiculous it's almost funny. Almost.Either the consultants on this movie did not do their research, or they've watched the original The Omen, with the skeletons of demonic Damien's jackal-headed parents being unearthed in the Egyptian desert (and the obvious allusion to Anubis), far too many times.In any case, I was turned off by either the sloppy ignorance or the intentional maligning of Egyptian divinity.

But I did. And cried my eyes out. The part that got to me was when Skip was watching the but leave and then at home trying to get onto Willie's bed. All I could think of was that Skip didn't know where Willie went or why. He didn't understand what had happened. All he knew was that his pal was gone.One thing that I didn't like was the subplot about Dink. I would have liked it if Willie's dad overheard their conversation and understood that Dink wasn't a coward and helped him to overcome it with the rest of the town. After Skip recovers in the hospital, all of the rest of Willie's friends, including Dink, just disappeared. It was as if they never existed in the story or Willie's life. If the script had done a little to resolve Dink's situation, I would have given the movie a 9.Then again, I saw this on broadcast television, so that part may have been edited out for time.
