Amazing, hip use of music (including John Cale's version of Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah'- how's that for obscure?). You don't have to be a kid to love it, or have kids to rent or buy it. Charming, sweet, funny and romantic. On DVD, try and get the (now inexplicably out-of-print) widescreen version, so you don't lose chunks of the lovely visuals on the sides of the frame.

It is undoubtedly one of the most original and innovative films you will ever see and will definitely stimulate your mind and senses. The film documents a series of lucid interactions of its lead character, Wiley Wiggins, as he meets an assortment of colourful and diverse persons. The basic premise is that Wiley doesn't know if he's awake, dreaming or in fact dead when he is meeting these people. Every facet of the film making process here is utilised to accentuate the confused state of the boy as he explores a world that may or may not be reality; it is expertly achieved. Lets start with the visuals. Waking life used pioneering robo(something?) technology to express the peculiar sensory disposition of its lead character. The technique involves real actors performing on camera and then for the finished product to be animated in post production. The result is a startling, other worldy and sometimes eerie ambiance. After ten minutes or so you will wonder if you are in fact experiencing a dream yourself. The wonderful animation works in conjunction with the meandering, non linear but exceedingly entertaining script, to give the viewer a real sense of queerness, and helps illuminate the fascinating insights of the characters Wiley meets. The animation also effectively keeps the viewer aware that he\/she is watching something that is not occurring in the conscious world. The script itself is thought provoking and utterly stimulating, and gets the viewer, if he or she is a creative and imaginative individual, to immerse him\/herself with the subject matter at hand and ask themselves the big questions of what life is all about, as the lead character does.Reading through some of the negative reviews on this website, I felt like flushing my head down the toilet. You cannot criticise a film for not doing something it never set out to do. Users on here have suggested that the film has no real narrative and that the characters are fleeting and inaccessible. Well duh? The film is about a dream, if any subject can allow for the abstract to flourish, it is subconsciousness. The film doesn't want to be a novel, it doesn't require a start middle and an end because it is merely an abstract exploration of social and cultural concepts. It doesn't want to explain the world to you and sew up the meaning of life, it just wants to provide a brief, vivid reflection of the elusive and tumultuous nature of ife. The characters are not there to be loved or hated or envied, they are there to represent the variety of beliefs and perspectives and opinions that mankind in all its diversity holds. The non linear essence of the film reflects the non linearity of life.Those of you who say this is not a film, I say you are an idiot. Who are you to say what constitutes art? A film doesn't need to pander to narratology to be good; its that sort of thinking which has led to the perpetuation of rubbish that we see made year upon year in the film industry. There should be no rules. Waking Life will give any forward thinking individual a fine film experience; it expertly achieves what Richard Linklater set out to do, which was to create a visually outstanding, mind expanding film which deals with social and cultural theory.Detractors of this film should drop out of that film studies class they have been attending because evidently it is turning you into a pretentious film prima donna.
