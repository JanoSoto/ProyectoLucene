He soon finds himself accused of being a serial killer, and pursued by strange men with bright white faces. He sets out on a mission to find some answers; but before too long, he finds himself part of a much more sinister plot. Director Alex Proyas ('I, Robot', 'The Crow') directs this Burton\/Gilliam-esquire portrayal of understanding the essence of being.This is very well compiled movie, with some great undertones to it. The opening is pretty gripping, in which a lot seems to happen and is somewhat subliminal in content. It is very fast paced, and erratically cut together so that it doesn't spend too long on each scene, this doesn't often give you time to consciously take in what happen, but the mind still registers what is going on. These erratic visuals make for an incredibly surreal opening; it is imperative that you allow yourself to suspend disbelief, and brace yourself for science-fiction mayhem. This setup is reflective of the protagonist 'Murdoch' (Rufus Sewell), being that neither the audience nor the main character understand what is going on at all. Lots of questions are asked, and it isn't until about 40 minutes in that the first question is vaguely answered.However, the length of time to answer even one question does not feel like a long time. Due to the pacing and the whole manner of execution in the first 40 minutes, it is easy to forget about time (considering you are at least accepting of such a genre of film). This is aided very well by some fantastically designed sets, lit perfectly to emulate the title and storyline of the film. Due to this, it is onerous to reference parts of the film without spoiling much of the plot.The plot is surprisingly deep for a film of its genre, with certain underlying themes as well as visuals which are slightly reminiscent of Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil'. It deals with the concept of what truly makes us human, and judges how unique we really are as a species. This is not only an aspect dealt with directly in the plot, but also has the potential to make you think about it too. The development of this plot is also superb, amidst the fast pace, the progression seems to be quite gradual. The acting talents were pretty inconsistent around this film, whilst there were some good performances; there were also some bad ones which detracted from the flow of the film at times. The film itself is remarkably gripping due to its pacing and visual intensity. But the acting takes you out of this. In particular, Kiefer Sutherland; while his character is a pretty strong and solid character, Sutherland just simply isn't convincing in his role. He seems to be trying too hard to be disparate to the roles he has performed before, as if trying to set himself up as a character actor, but unfortunately he fails with horrid consequences. Jennifer Connelly is also fairly mediocre; she gives a fairly bland, empty performance and is somewhat disappointing. Despite this, when the acting's good...It is really good; Richard O'Brien for one gives a fantastic performance as a darkly sinister villain, whilst also adequately incorporating his much loved element of camp behaviour. Rufus Sewell shines too, in the beginning he seems fairly unsure, but as the film goes on he gradually emerges to give a very interesting and plausible performance. Similarly, William Hurt gives a great performance too. These performances make for some good tension and suspense throughout; being that the plot is quite secretive in its build-up, it is hard to predict some actions as the film moves along.While there are some great visuals in cinematographic terms, as well as good performances and an intriguing story; there are some parts of the script which don't seem to fit, being that certain parts of dialogue are quite cheesy, in a bad sense. The line I have Murdoch in mind (which doesn't make sense here) is quite a paltry piece of speech. When watching the film it will be obvious why it has been noted.The special effects are also quite enjoyable, but they start to become overused by the end of the film. The climax to this film is somewhat a little dissatisfying and predictable, at which point tension and suspense becomes negligible. It is a surprising climax to have given the nature of the rest of the film, and due to the content of the climax, it is also somewhat tedious in its execution and brings the film down substantially. However, after this there is a great final scene in a visual sense.Overall, this film is pretty entertaining and not a typical film of the sci-fi genre. This is definitely one for fans of the genre, especially those who enjoyed 'Brazil' or 'The Matrix'. With some great performances, and a generally good script this is a highly entertaining and engaging film which requires some brain power to follow (which is often refreshing with a film of this style). This is 8 out of 10, unique, creative and visually enthralling. It is also heavily suggested that it be viewed in a darkened room for optimal impact.

It's strange what time can do for a film as it can either help or hurt it and in the case of this film it really seems to have helped it a great deal. I first saw this movie in the early 90's and found it rather weak and the next viewing didn't help much either. Now, being more than fifteen years, I decided to pay the film another visit and this time it really hit me as to why so many have called it as masterpiece. I still wouldn't call it DePalma's greatest film but it's certainly right up there and I couldn't help but wish we'd get this director back to making films like this. The film has a lot going for it but we can start with the visual style, which is at times breathtaking. DePalma has always been known for his style and that mixes extremely well with the scenes of early Chicago. Another major plus is a wonderful music score by the legendary Ennio Morricone. The score really puts you in the time and place of the setting but it also does a great job at pumping up the action as well as building the suspense. The train station sequence is one of the most memorable in the film but try watching it without the volume and without the score. It certainly isn't the same. Another major plus are the performances by the all-star cast. Costner is at the top of his game as the laid back ness and that's what makes Connery's performance so great. The two are completely different but together they make for an excellent team and you can't blame Oscar voters for awarding Connery the Best Supporting Actor. Garcia and Charles Martin Smith never get the credit they deserve but they too offer up fine work. I'm rather split on DeNiro because the screenplay really doesn't do him any justice as Capone seems to just be dropped into the film from time to time without any real need. I'm really not even sure we had to see Capone for the story to work. The film is rather brutal, violent and at times very suspenseful and this is why it remains so memorable today.

I hate most of Hollywood romantic comedies at the 2000s. And this one gives me no motive to think not !

Look at the situation, it's old but talented and creatively new this time; wedding planner who has no wedding plane for herself since her love life is empty, then prince charming comes along but he's a groom in one of her weddings. However, the whole time specifically from the horse problem to the double fiasco of the end's 2 weddings is one big crappy writing. The script didn't care about what's deep down the characters or establishing the idea of commitment or even making some fun thrilling time out of the in-the-nick-of-time-upheaval at the climatic sequence !While watching a scene like the one in which (Matthew McConaughey)'s character is trying to ask his bride do you really love me ? I was about to burst laughing indeed, saying well, this scriptwriter makes everything pretty easy, there is nothing cogent about her alteration after because of this talk ! (why he didn't say it earlier for god's sake ?!!). And (McConaughey) in the same scene even said something like our days in college.. !! Damn, we didn't know about their history together till now (or after !). And this father's move at the end ?? He's the last one on Earth to object to this fixed marriage, he himself had very successful one, and he didn't show us concern about the opposite way along the whole movie either. His last deed wasn't persuasive, like a move was done by the scriptwriter NOT his character ! Let alone other matters like when the lead was convincing the hesitating bride that she must marry using strange lines like you're timeless !! What is that ? The whole scene was corny. And truly as a romantic comedy I didn't run into comedy much, it had already some supporting characters and ironic situations that can make laughs but it didn't utilize any.The direction made it kind of smooth movie. The whole time is covered with pellucid diaphanous mantilla. But the music was just sonic comments without a character, being too soft to provocative extent sometimes !

The whole time is covered with pellucid diaphanous mantilla. But the music was just sonic comments without a character, being too soft to provocative extent sometimes ! It's obvious how they were using it to veil some weak situations (I wasn't satisfied with matter like the athletic competition between McConaughey and Lopez's alleged fiancé) anyhow, they always think that with cool soundtrack they can get away with it ! Furthermore minor annoying points  (McConaughey)'s hair looks pathetic all the time. (Bridgette Wilson) is not a good actress in the first place. And (Justin Chambers) as (Massimo) was so young for proposing to Lopez, looking 10 years younger than her while he's supposed to be her childhood companion !.I loved the movie's first 20 minutes. Though still the gorgeous presence of (Jennifer Lopez) is the best about it (at least that lasted for the end !). She becomes better actress with every movie, maybe she wasn't the best drunken here, but she managed to do it wholly fine, the thing is that the whole script here was not a fine one originally.The movie finally has one great scene; where (Lopez) got to dance with (McConaughey) that inflaming dance while being honest about their relationship. All the elements (including Lopez and her astonishing beauty, dancing, and that red dress) just collaborated to make such a solid, hot, attractive cinematic moment. Ohh, if only the whole movie was like this !To end my review I only have one very old worn phrase, but the movie forces me to say it  This story has been done so many times before, and better too.

This film combines some of the satirical humor that made Dr. Strangelove such a classic with the brutally objective eye that he trained on war in Paths of Glory. It's a story of the making of a killer, from boot-camp to the wrecked urban landscape of Vietnam. Matthew Modine plays the primary character, Joker, and you'll also see Vincent D'Onofrio giving a wonderful performance as Gomer Pile and R. Lee Ermey perfectly cast as the hard-ass drill instructor.But it's not really a movie about individual people, it's a movie about the loss of identity and individuality in the context of indoctrination and life-or-death struggles. As in Kubrick's 2001, the characters are only a mechanism for the themes of the film. It is a deliberately anti-melodramatic film that seeks to create its own formula. Like Barry Lyndon, its period recreations are incredibly faithful. The idea is more to transport you as the viewer into the environment, and not to allow us the easy separation between self and experience that a strong protagonist would have afforded us.The only real problem with the film is that there's no suitable ending, and what we do get by way of a conclusion is only a logical extension of the themes and doesn't really feel like it arises naturally from the material in any other way. I wish maybe something else could have been done to wrap it up, but I'm not sure what.Where other war films give us either heroism or villainy, this film is quite obviously about the duality of man, a phrase that even finds its way into the script. It views the phenomenon of war as just that, a natural product of the collective human imagination that follows its own rhythm and rules. And if there was no war, then what place would there be in the world for all these warriors we create? Sgt. Hartmann (Ermey) practically praises Lee Harvey Oswald for his sniping prowess, and another officer later ponders, when we rotate back to the States, we're gonna miss not having anyone worth shooting.

It literally develops a sort of cinematic delusions of grandeur, and this does NOT suit the film at all! I'm afraid Fight Club is not as good as everyone says. Maybe as the Sunday-afternoon- rainy day fun it works, but as a film so critically acclaimed and loved, it disappoints and neglects. The acting is NOT that impressive, the story is well written, but NOT a masterpiece and the ending has plot-holes as big as its megalomania.

Tetsuo has undergone through experimentation involving ESP and telekinesis called The Akira Project as it leaves some of his friends including Keneda worried until one night he snaps and goes on a rampage with his new powers to find the one that started it all called Akira.A brilliant, visually stunning, thought provoking and ultraviolent animated Sci-fi thriller from Japan that is one of the most unique experiences to hit the screen.

It passed by largely unnoticed, but has since grown in reputation due to video, DVD and repeated TV screenings. A favourite of drunk students, it's the best film made about friendship and also ticks those two indispensable boxes necessary for assessing a great film it stands up on repeated viewings and it is timeless.Bruce Robinson wrote from his own experiences of living as an unemployed actor in the 1960s (and, in the Uncle Monty case, of almost being seduced whilst filming 'Romeo and Juliet'). One of my all-time favourite films, it's the story of the end of a friendship and takes place in a very specific time and place London and the Lake District in the autumn of 1969. But's a world away from the 'Swinging 60s' of myth - this is an England of grim flats, of overcast and rainy countryside. Withnail (Richard E. Grant) and his anonymous flatmate (Paul McGann) are two unemployed actors sharing a run down Camden Town flat. They spend there time getting drunk at the pub, or buying cannabis from the hippie drug dealer Danny (Ralph Brown). Withnail is all ego and unfulfilled ambition, and a respite from their existence comes in the form of Uncle Monty (Richard Griffiths), who, in McGann's words, is raving homosexual. Monty loans them his Lake District cottage for a weekend. It turns out to gloomy and cold, and Monty soon arrives determined to have his wicked way with McGann. The two return to London, where McGann is offered a job in rep in Manchester and the two have a tearful farewell in the pouring rain before a drunken Withnail recites Hamlet to the Wolves.And that's it. There's no real story, just a series of incidents. No women, no romantic interest, no story arc or 'journey' so beloved of Hollywood scriptwriters. There are no 'jokes' as such, just witty and clever lines. And yet the film is perfect. Not a scene or a line could be cut without loosing something from the overall texture. The two actors complement each other beautifully the low-key McGann and the sometimes manic and desperate ex-public school boy Grant, frequently drunk, always resentful and bitter. Griffiths is a triumph as the flowery Monty, forever going on about his youthful indiscretions, but actually quite threatening when he bursts into McGann's bedroom dressed in a nightgown and proclaiming I adore you. And it's Danny who delivers my favourite line We're 90 days away from end of the greatest decade in the history of mankind. Outside, in the real world, the Beatles had just recorded their final album and British troops had just been sent to Northern Ireland. This is the end of the Sixties dream.The final farewell in the rain is poignant and moving without being mawkish. Like the best English films ('24 Hour Party People', 'Life of Brian', 'The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp'. 'A Matter of Life and Death'), it's a complete one off and one I shall never tire of seeing.

It passed by largely unnoticed, but has since grown in reputation due to video, DVD and repeated TV screenings. A favourite of drunk students, it's the best film made about friendship and also ticks those two indispensable boxes necessary for assessing a great film it stands up on repeated viewings and it is timeless.Bruce Robinson wrote from his own experiences of living as an unemployed actor in the 1960s (and, in the Uncle Monty case, of almost being seduced whilst filming 'Romeo and Juliet'). One of my all-time favourite films, it's the story of the end of a friendship and takes place in a very specific time and place London and the Lake District in the autumn of 1969. But's a world away from the 'Swinging 60s' of myth - this is an England of grim flats, of overcast and rainy countryside. Withnail (Richard E. Grant) and his anonymous flatmate (Paul McGann) are two unemployed actors sharing a run down Camden Town flat. They spend there time getting drunk at the pub, or buying cannabis from the hippie drug dealer Danny (Ralph Brown). Withnail is all ego and unfulfilled ambition, and a respite from their existence comes in the form of Uncle Monty (Richard Griffiths), who, in McGann's words, is raving homosexual. Monty loans them his Lake District cottage for a weekend. It turns out to gloomy and cold, and Monty soon arrives determined to have his wicked way with McGann. The two return to London, where McGann is offered a job in rep in Manchester and the two have a tearful farewell in the pouring rain before a drunken Withnail recites Hamlet to the Wolves.And that's it. There's no real story, just a series of incidents. No women, no romantic interest, no story arc or 'journey' so beloved of Hollywood scriptwriters. There are no 'jokes' as such, just witty and clever lines. And yet the film is perfect. Not a scene or a line could be cut without loosing something from the overall texture. The two actors complement each other beautifully the low-key McGann and the sometimes manic and desperate ex-public school boy Grant, frequently drunk, always resentful and bitter.

So I'm not sure how far this movie strayed away from the magic of the original cartoon. Makes me wonder if the new Star Trek film will make me love it or hate it since I'm a fan of the original.This film was very entertaining and fun. I have never seen the 60's cartoon, but found this movie at a good deal ($5) and picked it up. I popped it in the old DVD player one Sunday afternoon and felt a little guilty and embarrassed. Why? Because this movie was so beyond kiddie. I'm watching a movie with a squirrel and a bull! And loving it.Very over the top performances..but works very well in this format. I happened to watch Robocop 3 last night, and yes that was very over the top and became cheese! This film does it and succeeds. Robert Deniro does a wonderful job as he did in Dick Tracy. Sure, its no Casino or Heat! but he apparently understands the material and plays the role to fit the film. That's a good actor. No B-movie here. Shame this film is so trashed! Pure entertainment.

The plot is quite intriguing and original at the same time. It beautifully describes the story of a lonely and sad hit-man whom faith has bestowed the future of a smart but troubled little girl after her family was brutally murdered by a group of local corrupt policemen.The acting is very strong indeed. Natalie Portman delivers a top-notch performance in her breakthrough role as the distraught and very atypically 12 year old Mathilda who seeks revenge after the savagely killing of her family(especially of her little brother whom she cared for the most).IMO a performance worthy of an Academy Award nomination. Gary Oldman again accustoms us with a sharp delivery in the role of the villain who leads the pack of criminals. The portrayal of a psycothic and delusional corrupt officer is both convincing and unique at the same time. But the real tear-jerker is brought by Jean Reno's Leon character, a very innocent and warm-hearted hit-man(talk about great screenplay) who leads a desperate life of solitude until he meets Mathilda who will change him forever(the only thing that he was afraid to start with). Through the building up of the character you cannot simply be a stone-cold rock and not feel sympathy for Leon's struggle with the concept of love.The chemistry between him and Mathilda during the father-daughter relationship is awesome. A great cast overall but in the end it's Portman who steals the show!Also a huge compliment must be brought to the cinematography of the movie. Scenes like the angelic aura that surround Mathilda when Leon opens the door and implicitly saves her life or the one in which the same Leon bats itself with 2 handguns out from the ceiling of his apartment and right into the swarm of special-ops troops-men are beautifully and artistically created. Another big player is the melodic part which only adds up to the intensity of the on-going drama.To sum it all up Luc Besson once again amazes us after the huge successfully 'Le femme fatal Nikita' in creating a masterwork that touches you very deep emotionally and makes you very compassionate towards it's characters. Having fulfilled it's role as a film the only regret that this movie can possibly have is being 'born' in what i regard as 'movies annus dominis' along masterpieces like 'The shawshank redemption', 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Forrest Gump' thus cutting loose any change of critics recognition at Oscars(which is quite deserving for such a film) ","genre":null},{"date":"9 March 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Leon the professional is one of those movies that will certainly leave you in awe after the first viewing.

It beautifully describes the story of a lonely and sad hit-man whom faith has bestowed the future of a smart but troubled little girl after her family was brutally murdered by a group of local corrupt policemen.The acting is very strong indeed. Natalie Portman delivers a top-notch performance in her breakthrough role as the distraught and very atypically 12 year old Mathilda who seeks revenge after the savagely killing of her family(especially of her little brother whom she cared for the most).IMO a performance worthy of an Academy Award nomination. Gary Oldman again accustoms us with a sharp delivery in the role of the villain who leads the pack of criminals. The portrayal of a psycothic and delusional corrupt officer is both convincing and unique at the same time. But the real tear-jerker is brought by Jean Reno's Leon character, a very innocent and warm-hearted hit-man(talk about great screenplay) who leads a desperate life of solitude until he meets Mathilda who will change him forever(the only thing that he was afraid to start with). Through the building up of the character you cannot simply be a stone-cold rock and not feel sympathy for Leon's struggle with the concept of love.The chemistry between him and Mathilda during the father-daughter relationship is awesome. A great cast overall but in the end it's Portman who steals the show!Also a huge compliment must be brought to the cinematography of the movie. Scenes like the angelic aura that surround Mathilda when Leon opens the door and implicitly saves her life or the one in which the same Leon bats itself with 2 handguns out from the ceiling of his apartment and right into the swarm of special-ops troops-men are beautifully and artistically created. Another big player is the melodic part which only adds up to the intensity of the on-going drama.To sum it all up Luc Besson once again amazes us after the huge successfully 'Le femme fatal Nikita' in creating a masterwork that touches you very deep emotionally and makes you very compassionate towards it's characters. Having fulfilled it's role as a film the only regret that this movie can possibly have is being 'born' in what i regard as 'movies annus dominis' along masterpieces like 'The shawshank redemption', 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Forrest Gump' thus cutting loose any change of critics recognition at Oscars(which is quite deserving for such a film) ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"9 March 2009","score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" There is no great beyond. There is nothing waiting for us, there is nothing to look forward to, there is no hope for the days to come. This is an obituary for the generation past.The Big Chill is one of the greatest American movies ever made dealing with the concept of loss. I am you. I am all of you. A generation lost, a generation out of the tracks and into the unknown. You are what you choose in this life, not in some glorious afterlife, you are your hopes and dreams, your failures and successes, your mistakes and wrong doings, your past and your future, you are your friends.There is no doubt that the concept of modern western life runs through the looking glass of adulthood and friendship. These two ethical constructions define not only the individual, but also his surrounding environment, the juxtaposition of self and society, of creation or destruction within the normal boundaries of a capitalistic State. It is within these constructions that family is born. Nevertheless, the binding force of the entire human web is based on the only natural error that Man has never come to terms with death.The circle of friends portrayed in The Big Chill is long broken; a smell of forgotten innocence only remains to remind the group that once they were one. Not pieces of a puzzle, but the puzzle itself. Back in college they've learned to act as a fist, with strong bonds with one another; back in the American 60s, they learned that the dream of piece, love and understanding was not utopic, not unreachable, but just moments away&#x85; All of this now already faded away.In the prosperous America of the 80s lies another reality for them, the ultimate capitalistic dream, the life of the modern man encloses words such as family, money, kids, school, house, company, but not friendship. The ultimate hope of the once strongly connected group rests in the hands of the misfit, the one that never grew up, the one that probably stayed glued onto daydreams of the past and not conformities of the present, the boy that flew out of the window. And it is in this point exactly where Lawrence Kasdan begins his story, he heard a sound, probably we all did, and it was from the grapevine.The circle comes into closure, when one dies. After the funeral, a weekend is all that there is left for the eight friends to try and comprehend what went wrong. But in this very last stand of their own, they realize that what was missing was not something out there, but rather something within each and every one of them; old friends after all miss each other.

At the end, we'll all leave in that house forever, alongside with Sam, Sarah, Michael, Nick, Harold, Meg, sipping coffee, hot chocolate and wine under the sounds of Marvin Gaye and the Temptations, knowing that all this is our personal, unique hideaway, our world outside the world, our very own Neverland.

The series always engaged in a brinkmanship with itself, each successive film attempting to top what had gone before with something more outlandish and more breathtaking - and THE SPY WHO LOVED ME follows the Bond blueprint but is consistently imaginative and inventive. Whereas the preceding film THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN lacked the big epic set pieces which makes people watch the Bond films, THE SPY WHO LOVED ME reinvigorated the series. At the start of the movie Bond ski jumps off an Alp and floats down on a Union Jack parachute. There's a megalomaniac millionaire who lives in a submersible lair. An oil tanker with a submarine pen hidden inside and even a Lotus Espirt which turns into a mini-submarine.Released in 1977 at the time of detant (an early thawing of the Cold War), the plot involves the disappearance of British and Russian nuclear submarines. The British Ministry of Defence are understandably alarmed as their Polaris sub has 16 Polaris missiles on board, so 007 (Roger Moore) is dispatched to pursue the tracking device which enabled the villains to locate the submarines in the first place. This leads him to Eygpt and an encounter with his Russian opposite number Anya (Babara Bach), and then to Sardinia and an encounter with the megalomaniac shipping magnet Stromberg (Curt Jurgens) and his indestructible henchman Jaws (Richard Keil with metal teeth). Stromberg's aim is to launch a nuclear strike at the US and USSR and cause World War Three. Eventually Bond leads the British, Russian and US navies in a climactic battle on board Stromberg's oil tanker HQ\/submarine pen and eventually averts a nuclear holocaust by using the tracking device to get the villain's two submarines to destroy each other.The film's inventiveness is matched by some wonderful Ken Adam sets. A terrific exchange of gunfire and grenades inside the submarine pen reminds you of how good screen battles used to look before GCI turned them into extensions of computer games. A very suave and witty Roger Moore - whose urbane presence recalls an earlier age of English leading man - is certainly a far cry from Daniel Craig. The film has a kind of fish and chips patriotism about it, with its Union Jack parachute and an early scene in which the blonde girl Bond is leaving in a ski chalet says But James, I need you and he replies So does England - that's part of it's charm.

A well made, genuinely tense film that plays with ideas about race and explores consequences of decisions made years before. The graphic opening is not one I can watch easily and adds an tight rope feeling to the following events. The male criminals' venality is frighteningly mundane to themselves. Cynda Williams as the broken Lila, doing what she can to help her son, brings a vulnerability to Bily Bob Thornton's character which is not enough to lessen his coldness. He appears to love her yet we all believe he would kill her without thought if his survival necessitated it. Bill Paxton's portrayal of a good ole boy, with a secret of his own is sensitive. Sympathetic enough to make us care and believe he is a fundamentally decent man, it does not shy from the reality of a man who has failed to live up to his own expectations. Using another ordinary house as the backdrop to the final bloodbath again emphasises the sadness of the story which reflects far too many broken lives. Having Dale meet his son for the first (and last?) time plays on our emotions and leaves just as many questions unanswered as have been tackled by the events and characters of the film.
