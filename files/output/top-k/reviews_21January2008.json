From what I'd gathered beforehand, I knew I could expect something that could best be described as a gritty-feeling movie. In hindsight, I don't think you can describe Naked as being a gritty-feeling movie. You end up describing gritty-feeling movies as being like Naked.That statement is pretty true &#150; Naked is as bleak and unforgiving as they come. There are no good guys or any possible chances for redemption. Whenever a glimmer of hope appears during the film, it's obliterated within mere moments. The characters don't undergo any significant changes throughout the film. The film ends in pretty much the same way it begins, probably doomed to repetition until the end of the world. If you sit down to watch this, all I can say is be prepared. Know what you're getting into.Although the unforgettable feel of the film could be attributed to its verité style (filmed on the dodgy side of London with very rough-looking film), it could be better attributed to the protagonist himself. David Thewlis gives what's probably his best performance as Johnny, a man with few strengths and countless flaws. His eloquent monologues are roughly balanced by his harsh treatment of others. Johnny has very little respect for anyone or anything and it shows as he inflicts pain (physical or emotional, it doesn't matter to him) on everybody that crosses his path.As bad as he is, however, he's oddly sympathetic in a way (especially when compared to a landlord who's as callous and sociopathic as he is, possibly more so). In a way, I could actually relate to Johnny (and not just because I have the same coat). He knows how bad he can be and acts accordingly, only because he doesn't believe in anything else or changing his ways. He just exists from day to day, just like any other human being. That's what makes Johnny so compelling &#150; he really is only human. When karma finally catches up to him late in the film, we aren't glad to see him suffer. Johnny is the best kind of character, full of nuance that will make different people love him and hate him for the same reasons.Even though Naked depends heavily on Johnny's presence, he is not the be-all and end-all of the film. The supporting characters are exceptional &#150; the stand-out roles being Johnny's ex and her flatmate. Watching them try and deal with the sudden arrival of both Johnny and (later on) the landlord is in itself one very compelling subplot. A runner-up would be the security guard on his graveyard shift who engages in a series of debates with Johnny about time, life, evolution and the inevitable Apocalypse.Needless to say, Naked was one hell of a film to watch. It makes me wonder exactly how I should rate it, if I should rate it. It's not really one of those movies where you just say Oh yeah, very good, very moving, 4 stars. You're more likely to watch it and afterwards not say anything, just think about it. Those are the exceptional films, and Naked is definitely that &#150; a dark, pessimistic insight into the mind of a human being who treads the fine line between self-destruction and utter dissatisfaction.

And those expectations would seem to be the same if I looked at the IMDb reviews.However, soon enough into the movie I remembered that not all indie movies with quirky premises are works of genius. The whole film felt like the writer\/director saw Trainspotting and took the wrong things from it.One element in particular that gave this feeling is the use of narration. With movies like Goodfellas, Fight Club, City of God, and of course, Trainspotting among my favorites, I am certainly not opposed to movies told in the first person. But James Merendino seems to think narration is a valid substitute for characterization and plot development. Most of the narration says things about the characters and events that either would be more interesting shown in the film rather than simply told, or has already been shown in the film, and is thus being redundant. Very rarely does the narration actually do something to add to the story. I don't know about the other reviewers, but I found it pretty clear from the beginning that being an anarchist in Salt Lake isn't easy, before Stevo told us several times, and by the time he tells us flat-out that Mike is hardcore despite his outwardly preppy appearance, Mike has already *well* established that in a certain fight scene.I also felt the film squandered a lot of potential. In one of the first shots, where the camera zooms in on targets made from Reagan portraits, I became excited about a thought-provoking and unique critique on such an oppressively conservative atmosphere as Reagan-era America against the backdrop of already religious and conservative Salt Lake City. Instead, the characters' rants seem to go little beyond yelling the F-word and telling the audience what anarchy means(not what it means to them, just the dictionary definition of anarchy) for the umpteenth time. The closest the movie comes to an actually intelligent argument for punk\/anarchy is Stevo's rant at his parents, and even then it rambles and becomes little more than saying things very eloquently. In fact, all the script ever seems to do to try to depict punks as anything beyond the stereotype is embellish their dialog with the same kind of faux-eloquence that Bill and Ted enjoyed using so much. I was disappointed how despite how much there is to argue against the system, especially in Reagan-era *anywhere*, no one really discusses why they choose anarchy or what's wrong with the government\/system. Everyone seems to be content with a blind, almost dogmatic belief in anarchy.This isn't to say that I completely hated the movie, however. There were certainly parts that I thought were funny and well-done. I loved the scenes with Sean, the character of Mark and the scene that highlighted him, and the trip to the liquor store, among other scenes. When the movie hit the mark in scenes like these, it was hilarious and original.I thought it was overall decent film-making, as far as camera and editing technique goes. However, I thought it sometimes tried to pass style off as substance; a prime example being the overtly complicated digression about The Fight, that despite using an interesting, if not inventive, montage of images and clips in conjunction with a mock-lecture from the narrator, ultimately says and means nothing, and is not only content with that, but fully aware of it.Overall, I was pretty disappointed with SLC Punk!. I thought there was decent film-making throughout and some good parts here and there, but this was ruined whenever the the narration came in or Stevo broke the fourth wall. The characters were rarely more than ideas or stereotypes, and never seemed to stand for anything more than F**k the system, without figuring out or explaining why.

This is because it never really elevates itself above the material it actually is. At a time when the Lethal Weapon films had proved there was a demand for white cop with black sidekick buddy combination type films, Another 48 Hrs. is perhaps a cash in sequel to a film that was never anything special any way. Where as it sounds like I'm being negative, the film was enjoyable for what it was and that said; I would have a hard time in deciding which one I liked more.A scene from this film which typically sums up the genre the film is working under highlights not only the genres inability to ever be anything above a certain level but also the problem films face when they age. The film is a crime film; a buddy combination of two people getting involved in shoot outs and general criminal activity whilst battling each others egos. In 1994 when Pulp Fiction came out, films like Another 48 Hrs. were history and a particular scene is defining evidence shortly after a prison bus has rolled over a few times, two hells angels are going to kill someone on board. But what happens is instead of riding up to the overturned bus and finishing the job, they park their bikes a few hundred yards away, get off very slowly and walk up to the bus with the intent to kill. Now, there is absolutely no reason for them to do this apart from add suspense to the scene and perhaps have two bikers walk in tandem; in slow motion amongst the heat wave in a 'cool' fashion. This is the point; films such as these rely on what would look good cinematically rather than stick to what their characters would do.I know it's wrong to compare a film to another film made after it but this highlights not only the bad way in which Another 48 Hrs. has aged but further cements what a great film Pulp Fiction really is; the buddy combination in that film of Jules and Vincent who are by no coincidence black and white but Tarantino plays with realism in the film and the scene in which someone is accidentally shot in the back of the car is so much more clear in the sense it is two fingers up to scenes like the one just mentioned in Another 48 Hrs. The film starts off with Reggie (Murphy) still in prison and shows up its other half of the buddy combination as a bit of an idiot. Another 48 Hrs. suffers from its cliché that its best cop on the force, Jack (Nolte), is actually a loose cannon whom needs to be removed even though the job is actually perfect for him; an idea toyed with in the third Die Hard film but with John McLane. Jack seems certain that an antagonist known as The Iceman is at large but is demeaned and shown up as perhaps a bit of a schizophrenic; one officer labelling this Iceman as an imaginary friend\/enemy who Jack has been pretending to chase.Unfortunately, the initial incident in the film happens a little early by way of a shooting at a race track. What I couldn't understand is that with all those people watching the race, nobody saw the bad guy shoot at Jack and consequently; the police have their eye on him. Reggie on the other hand is out of jail and he miraculously survives an attack on a bus (mentioned earlier) as it rolls over several times; something that would have killed him. But the film suffers from it lack of logic that can be applied to certain situations The bus rolls over; the bikers aren't professional enough; the back up arrives a too quickly and are unable to spot the bikers fleeing; the bikers in other scenes get their guns out in full public view too many times but nobody ever seems to mind and generally, there is an acute sense of frustration during these times. But the film backs itself up with a scene in a nightclub during which it makes a pastiche out of its predecessor by putting Jack in a punch up only for Reggie to save him by acting out his cop\/no nonsense routine by threatening to shoot first and the ask questions later. Along with this, Jack even makes reference to 'typical bar punch ups that you get in the movies' where he states someone always hits else someone over the head with a chair or a glass bottle. Jack then does exactly that with a bottle and the chair soon follows.But to me, this is Another 48 Hrs. recognising that is knows what it is; that it knows the formula its using and is having fun playing around with the clichés; even if scenes such as the bus rolling and the bikers not doing what they should do by finishing the job. The film is by no means great or groundbreaking but I was never bored or put off by what I was seeing; it may have lacked realism and been since pushed down a peg in the crime genre hierarchy by bigger and better films but it remains entertaining to a degree with gunshots powerful enough to propel people through windows and cops smart enough to wear bullet proof vests whilst off duty. Another 48 Hrs. is by no means a big winner but it is by no means a massive loser, even if it may indeed look like that in another twenty years.

Neither Yoda or Mace Windu, played by the always welcome Sam Jackson, believe him, they are too confident in their power.Our heroes are up against it on NAboo and Amidala seeks help form the Gungans. Their leader Boss Nass is suspicious but Jar Jar and Padme's confession that she is really Amidala, queen of the NAboo, convince him of their sincerity. Dorids R2-D2 and C-3po help out and they conceive of a plan to deactivate the droid army. A well-conceived plan, however there's great risk.-Qui-gon. That is why we must not fail to get the viceroy, everything depends on it.-Padme.The battle for Naboo is played out like Spartacus against the Romans and its epic in scope and power. Even Anakin helps out with R2 and knocks the droid control ship out of the stars. But Darth Maul, under command of a mysterious Sith, confronts Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon! A terrific Duel of the fates takes place and Qui-Gon is killed. Obi-Wan vanquishes Maul, but must promise to train Anakin in the ways of the Force, something he is strangely reluctant to do.Our heroes are honored by PAdme in a great Naboo ceremony, Qui-Gon is said goodbye to but both Yoda and Mace feel the danger is far from over. Absolutely great with a complex political plot, dangerously good FX and super performances. Natalie Portman is the only actress who could play Luke and LEia's mother and she does it so well! The age of Anakin, could a ten-year old really pull this off? And the timeline in relation to IV are the only quibbles with a great movie.

I didn't particularly care for the technical update George Lucas made to it, was it really right to add such cheese? And why alter dialog? Example; Obi-Wan-Mos Eisley spaceport, you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. Luke Skywalker-I'm ready for anything. Terrific stuff, why change it! That being said, it's a fast-paced awesome sci-fi flick.Admitteldy after you're reeling from the FX in the opening shot, the movie slows to follow C-3po and R2-D2, they're cute, but its a long 30 minutes. thankfully the plot picks up when were introduced to Luke and his Aunt and Uncle, moisture farmers on the barren planet of Tatooine. Luke is my favourite character in all six films and Mark Hamill does a great job portraying his innocence and courage. Soon we met Old Ben Kenobi, a former general and Jedi Knight of the Republic, now a recluse, but he knew Luke's shadowy father and tells Luke he must fight the Empire now strangling the galaxy.Lucas uses great editing and cutting to show the Empire at work, Peter Cushing, a veteran English actor known for his work in horror movies, is the cruel Grand Moff Tarkin, and in this film, it is he who hold Darth Vader's leash, as Leia says. Vader is simply one of the most iconic villains ever on screen, black and imposing, his breathing is so alien nd mechanical that you fear him. It's clear that young Leia Organa, played by Carrie Fisher, is the leader in the rebellion and hell-bent on destroying the Empire's greatest weapon, the Death Star. And yes, it does sadly resemble a giant, gray tomato.After his Aunt and Uncle are killed by the Empire's Stormtroppers, Luke and Ob-WAn ( Ben) go to find a pilot to take them to Alderaan, LEia's home world. Here we meet Han Solo, a cynical rogue played with youthful authority by HArrison Ford. They split in his Millennium Flacon only to find Alderaan destroyed by the Death STar. Here I always felt this scene was not given the significance a planet's destruction deserves. it's too brief and too vague, we never really see any of the planet, only Leia and Darth's reactions save this from being a failure. In fact we only get the briefest glimpse of what Alderran may have been like for Leia in Episode 3.Our heroes are trapped on the Death Star but thankfully they rescue princess Leia, but Darth Vader's confronts and kills Ob-Wan in one of the biggest shocks in cinematic history. To off Alec Guiness halfway through your movie was a very ballsy movie by Lucas.Our heroes are set up by Vader to lead them to the hidden Rebel base and only a desperate attempt by Luke can destroy the Death STar and save the galaxy. This final batter is patterned after WW2 films and is visual breathtaking. Some science fiction purists object to the Force in this movie, that destroying planets and relying on technology is no match for faith, but it makes this all very emotional and Han's selfless act is a big surprise and really works. Our heroes are decorated and the film end on John Williams' rousing score.In some ways this was meant to stand alone, only brief hints are given as to a massive back story for our characters and it doesn't hinder this episode or make it lacking. Star WArs- A NEw Hope is fantastic entertainment from start to finish. Some charges levied against the film, racism, silliness and a lack of depth, are groundless, originally James Earl Jones was not the voice of DArth Vader and Han Solo was black, and the obvious tension between Luke and Han over Leia was only to make a point of interest for older viewers. The film is exciting and grand and very much worth your time.

Soon we met Old Ben Kenobi, a former general and Jedi Knight of the Republic, now a recluse, but he knew Luke's shadowy father and tells Luke he must fight the Empire now strangling the galaxy.Lucas uses great editing and cutting to show the Empire at work, Peter Cushing, a veteran English actor known for his work in horror movies, is the cruel Grand Moff Tarkin, and in this film, it is he who hold Darth Vader's leash, as Leia says. Vader is simply one of the most iconic villains ever on screen, black and imposing, his breathing is so alien nd mechanical that you fear him. It's clear that young Leia Organa, played by Carrie Fisher, is the leader in the rebellion and hell-bent on destroying the Empire's greatest weapon, the Death Star. And yes, it does sadly resemble a giant, gray tomato.After his Aunt and Uncle are killed by the Empire's Stormtroppers, Luke and Ob-WAn ( Ben) go to find a pilot to take them to Alderaan, LEia's home world. Here we meet Han Solo, a cynical rogue played with youthful authority by HArrison Ford. They split in his Millennium Flacon only to find Alderaan destroyed by the Death STar. Here I always felt this scene was not given the significance a planet's destruction deserves. it's too brief and too vague, we never really see any of the planet, only Leia and Darth's reactions save this from being a failure. In fact we only get the briefest glimpse of what Alderran may have been like for Leia in Episode 3.Our heroes are trapped on the Death Star but thankfully they rescue princess Leia, but Darth Vader's confronts and kills Ob-Wan in one of the biggest shocks in cinematic history. To off Alec Guiness halfway through your movie was a very ballsy movie by Lucas.Our heroes are set up by Vader to lead them to the hidden Rebel base and only a desperate attempt by Luke can destroy the Death STar and save the galaxy. This final batter is patterned after WW2 films and is visual breathtaking. Some science fiction purists object to the Force in this movie, that destroying planets and relying on technology is no match for faith, but it makes this all very emotional and Han's selfless act is a big surprise and really works. Our heroes are decorated and the film end on John Williams' rousing score.In some ways this was meant to stand alone, only brief hints are given as to a massive back story for our characters and it doesn't hinder this episode or make it lacking. Star WArs- A NEw Hope is fantastic entertainment from start to finish. Some charges levied against the film, racism, silliness and a lack of depth, are groundless, originally James Earl Jones was not the voice of DArth Vader and Han Solo was black, and the obvious tension between Luke and Han over Leia was only to make a point of interest for older viewers.

It is heart pounding with the scenery and the blue of the TV screen giving a eery light to the set. On another high note Drew's blonde wig is fabulous looking and it is a shame that she is killed off so early, but it does catch you off guard, similar to what Janet Leigh did in Psycho. It is suspenseful and filled with exciting chase sequences and clever kills. With the exception of the first scene there is not too much gore which makes this a good movie for people who like suspense but not so much blood. The not yet married Courtney Cox and David Arquette offer comic relief as the lovable Gail and Dewey! Now the down side. The whole movie is supposed to be a tribute to horror films. Halloween is constantly referenced and Jaime Kennedy's character has an uncomfortable obsession with Jaime Lee Curtis. In the end the charchter's reveals their motives where to be like charchters in the movies. He references some of my favorite horror films such as Halloween, Friday the 13th, Carrie, Psycho, and Silence of the Lambs. What is so bad about it is that they overdo it with the movie references. It gets to a point where it actually kills all those other movies for me. If I were to remake the movie that is the only thing I would do differently is not make such a big deal out of being a tribute.
