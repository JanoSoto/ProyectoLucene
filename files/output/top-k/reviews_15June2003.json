Don't read unless you've seen the movie.At this point, almost a decade after its release, Schindler's List is what it is it has become a cultural touchstone, and its reputation rightfully precedes it. It certainly has an aura and a cachet that goes beyond any single endeavor to praise or criticize it; therefore, I plan to do neither, but merely to share some of the thoughts I had while watching it. Some will be positive, others more negative - but none of it is meant to (or will be able to) diminish what Spielberg has achieved with this movie.First off, I must say that all the scenes with Schindler himself I found riveting Liam Neeson - not an actor I usually warm up to very well - was absolutely mesmerizing he gave the character an authority and a charisma that was totally captivating, while still preserving the basic enigmatic nature of the man. (He reminded me again and again of a young Richard Burton when he was at the top of his game.) The tug-of-war of conscience in the scenes between him and Stern (Ben Kingsley, underplaying nicely) were, though a bit schematic and obvious, nonetheless powerful - no doubt because of the enormity of the topic at hand. Holocaust movies, of course, can very easily get a free pass because of that very enormity, and Schindler's List is no exception scenes that might otherwise have seemed simplistic or overplayed are imbued with power because of the context in which they occur.One scene that stuck out for me, though - and not necessarily in a good way - was the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto. It is of course a tour-de-force of filmmaking and technical prowess (a foreshadowing, say, of the Normandy Beach sequence in Saving Private Ryan), but its reason for being I found suspect. Ostensibly - on the level of the story, anyway - it was there to bring Schindler face to face with the horror and waste of the Nazi policy toward the Jews, and so to suggest a reason why he converted from shameless profiteer and exploiter to Jewish savior.Except, as such a scene, it doesn't quite wash. Schindler indeed is displayed as witnessing the liquidation, but from his vantage point - a hill overlooking the ghetto - he would in no way have been able to see the scene in the detail, and in all the different locations, that the movie makes us privy to. No, this scene is designed not to be played before Schindler, but to be played before us, the moviegoers.So why does that bother me? Well, it seems to me a break in form. A movie that had been, up until that time, focusing narrowly on one man, suddenly opens up to wanting to display the panoply of characters and lives that were directly affected by the Holocaust. Problem is, by adopting such a large-scale approach, no one individual (or family) is able to claim our full attention, and so Spielberg becomes guilty in his own way of `ghetto'-izing the Jews - that is, grouping them together facelessly as victims, rather than showcasing any of their dignity or humanity as individuals.My bias, I suppose, in films dealing with the Holocaust, is that the enormity of it is just lost on most of us. It's impossible - unless we lived and survived through it - to do justice to both its scale and its horror. Therefore, a film-maker shouldn't try. Not that Holocaust-themed films shouldn't be made; it's just that, to be honest and effective (not necessarily the same thing - particularly when the artist is Spielberg) they should focus themselves on a small *microcosm* of it - a family, a person, a survivor - and attempt to *SUGGEST* the full horrors, through the particulars of that person's story. Actually trying to show those horrors outright (to put us, as it were, `inside' the Holocaust) is frankly impossible, and I think Spielberg's ambitions to do so, through this liquidation scene and other similar ones in the movie - are, though perhaps high-minded, ultimately wrong-headed.But, as I say, when he's focused narrowly on Schindler himself, the film works wonderfully - and is far more able, in my opinion, to get across the horror and waste of the Holocaust than when it's concentrating on its big (but impersonal) `herd up the Jews' scenes. The making up of the list itself is extremely powerful in this regard `More names! More names!' Schindler demands, and his mania in doing so tells us all we need to know about the absolute desperation of the times (particularly as it comes from a formerly amoral man only interested in himself).And as such, I must take exception to all those (and there are many) who find the last scene - Schindler's breakdown - to be completely maudlin and ill-advised, a detriment to an otherwise marvelous motion picture. To me, it was the best scene in the movie. For, in the character's hysterical insistence that he `could have done more' - coming on the heels of all the people we saw that he *DID* save - it serves to remind the audience - in absolutely unambiguous terms - that what Oskar Schindler did, though momentous, wasn't'even a drop in the bucket compared to the number of lives taken and\/or disrupted by the Holocaust. That this man - driven to bankruptcy and ruin by his (eventual) unceasing efforts to save the Jews - could claim that he `didn't do enough,' only shows how much there was to do, and how much of it was left undone. That, to me, is the kind of moment that brings home the enormity of the Holocaust - not the use of hundreds of extras to be herded onto trains and into showers. We can tell ourselves (and be right) that those scenes are fake (staged for the movie).

On top of that 3D films are always badly directed in an unnatural manner with objects poking through the screen. FRIDAY THE I3TH 3D gimmick isn`t as intrusive as JAWS 3 but that doesn`t stop it from being a poor movie .

He made me laugh like a 6th grade school girl every time he opened his mouth. He was as funny as Jim Carey in Liar Liar. Why he's not on the big screen more is one of life's great mysteries.

This kid (sorry, anyone born in the 1980s is a kid to me) has got some seriously underused acting chops.

The script is clear-eyed about what it wants to say about life back then, dealing with bigotry and the effects of a newly integrated society, and doesn't view the past through rose-colored glasses.

It is a film that works on a myriad of levels; as a comedy; as social commentary; as a coming of age film; as a satire about American family life; and as a pure entertainment.  The photography by Robert Surtees is visionary, it gives the precise look the film needs to set the tone for the story and precedes the boldness of underexposure that cinematographers would delves into only a few years later.  The script by Buck Henry is marvelous and a serves as all the script as both a foundation and springboard for great possibility.  In other word the nuances, the quirks, the subtleties that lend a film of the magnitude and resonance of The Graduate its distinctness always belong to the people that bring it to life, namely the actors and the director, but the screenwriter gives us the body.  The casting is one of those sort of conundrums or quirks of fate that all great works seem to have.  Initially as the producer of this film talks about they were shooting for a more typical all-american cast particularly in the case of Benjamin Braddock the track star, but looking back at it now with 20\/20 who can imagine anyone else playing the role of Benjamin the way Dustin Hoffman played it.  This illustrates that sometimes a project takes on this whole life-force.  I'm not saying that the film was destined to succeed, there is no doubt that the film is a testament to the hard fought genius of artist like Mike Nichols, Robert Surtees, Buck Henry, Dustin Hoffman and Anne Banecroft.  With that said there are these things, these curiosities, these chips that seem to fall into place, a perfect alignment of the stars.  But at the end of the day to me the most beautiful thing about the film is the story.  You have these two products (in Elaine and Benjamin) of the so-called all-American family who had Mrs. Robinson not interrupted would have no doubt married each other, it had been set up from the beginning.  Note that when Ben comes over to the Robinson house to pick Elaine up Mr. Robinson says, It's about time you got around to this Braddock, and that Ben's parents are persistent in nagging there son to take Elaine Robinson out.  Perhpas things are not so different in America after all.  If Mrs. Robinson had intervened then there would have been nothing unique about the story.  But of course she does, she wants something for her self, to take something that her daughter might have had and to possess it for herself, in a sad way it is her last attempt at trying to reach out and connect with someone, and after it is over it is too late for her, she is dead.  In the end despite the brief road block of Elaine being married off to Carl Smith Benjamin's back up since he was deemed by Elaine's parents to be inadequate they have set things back on course, but not before shaking them up, and doing it their way.  But then we have the ominous and somewhat ambiguous ending where both characters get on th bus and go through different emotions, but not at the same time.  In the end these two characters must accept that in spite of all their kicking, scratching, world-shaking and hell-raising there is only so far they can go, they can only be so different.  They are still going to get married, they have taken a slight detour, only to realize in the end that perhaps their is only one road.

The events leading up to a fateful night at a Los Angeles harbor are traced from the viewpoint of a crippled con artist from Queens. You never know how much of what is said is genuine, since the narrator is of limited intelligence and naive in comparisson to his former partners. After securing immunity by the D.A., Verbal Kint is coerced into telling a New York-based Customs agent David Kujan about what happened between the line-up six weeks earlier, where he met his compatriots, and the night that a boat allegedly carrying narcotics was destroyed. Kujan has played somewhat of a Javert to one of Verbal's associates, Dean Keaton, an ex-cop from New York who was trying to go straight after a career as a hijacker, and settle down with his lovely attorney girlfriend--or so Verbal paints him to be. The other three, McManus, Fenster, and Todd Hockney, create an array of decidedly different people. Keaton, always the reluctant partisipant, spars often with McManus, a psychotic given to fits of violent rage, vying for the role of leader of the gang. Fenster, McManus' partner from before, is a mild-mannered Latino who tries to stay out of the way of things. Hockney is a mechanic and explosives expert who doesn't care about anyone but himself, but tensions flare between him and McManus as well. Verbal is sort of the odd man out crippled so that he is limited in physicality, and inexperienced in the art of hijacking.After pulling off a successful job in New York, the five men travel to LA to meet McManus and Fenster's fence, Redfoot. After a job goes bad they are conronted with a mysterious attorney working for a legendary gangster named Keyser Soze. The attorney, Kobayashi, charges them with one final job.The story, as presented by Verbal Kint, presents one final question Who is Keyser Soze. Keaton doesn't believe in him. Kujan believes Keaton IS him. And it ends with a twist that you may never see coming (unless you read between the lines of the reviews posted).Gabriel Byrne plays the reluctant Irish cop with conviction. Kevin Spacey's Oscar-winning (and star-making) Verbal Kint seems the most mild and simple of people. Chazz Palminteri's David Kujan is perfect to counter the image Verbal describes of Keaton. Smaller supporting roles by Pete Postlethwaite, as Kobayashi, Dan Hedaya, as a restless LA cop, Giancarlo Esposito as an FBI agent friend of Kujan's, and Benicio Del Toro's sly Fenster (five years before he won the Oscar for Traffic), help to give fully-fleshed characters to Christopher McQuarrie's already-rich storytelling, and Bryan Singer's (X-Men, X2) career-making direction.

After securing immunity by the D.A., Verbal Kint is coerced into telling a New York-based Customs agent David Kujan about what happened between the line-up six weeks earlier, where he met his compatriots, and the night that a boat allegedly carrying narcotics was destroyed. Kujan has played somewhat of a Javert to one of Verbal's associates, Dean Keaton, an ex-cop from New York who was trying to go straight after a career as a hijacker, and settle down with his lovely attorney girlfriend--or so Verbal paints him to be. The other three, McManus, Fenster, and Todd Hockney, create an array of decidedly different people. Keaton, always the reluctant partisipant, spars often with McManus, a psychotic given to fits of violent rage, vying for the role of leader of the gang. Fenster, McManus' partner from before, is a mild-mannered Latino who tries to stay out of the way of things. Hockney is a mechanic and explosives expert who doesn't care about anyone but himself, but tensions flare between him and McManus as well. Verbal is sort of the odd man out crippled so that he is limited in physicality, and inexperienced in the art of hijacking.After pulling off a successful job in New York, the five men travel to LA to meet McManus and Fenster's fence, Redfoot. After a job goes bad they are conronted with a mysterious attorney working for a legendary gangster named Keyser Soze. The attorney, Kobayashi, charges them with one final job.The story, as presented by Verbal Kint, presents one final question Who is Keyser Soze. Keaton doesn't believe in him. Kujan believes Keaton IS him. And it ends with a twist that you may never see coming (unless you read between the lines of the reviews posted).Gabriel Byrne plays the reluctant Irish cop with conviction. Kevin Spacey's Oscar-winning (and star-making) Verbal Kint seems the most mild and simple of people. Chazz Palminteri's David Kujan is perfect to counter the image Verbal describes of Keaton. Smaller supporting roles by Pete Postlethwaite, as Kobayashi, Dan Hedaya, as a restless LA cop, Giancarlo Esposito as an FBI agent friend of Kujan's, and Benicio Del Toro's sly Fenster (five years before he won the Oscar for Traffic), help to give fully-fleshed characters to Christopher McQuarrie's already-rich storytelling, and Bryan Singer's (X-Men, X2) career-making direction.

Whatever you seek in a film...you will find it Edward Scissorhands. It's one of the greatest stories ever told and easily one of the best films ever. Tim Burton is a wonderful director and this masterpiece has written his name all over it. Edward is not a normal human being. He wasn't born, he was created by an inventor who lived in a big, dark house on a hill. Unfortunately, the inventor died before he had the chance to complete Edward, so he has scissors instead of hands. Many years after the dead of the inventor, Peg Boggs (a sweet local lady who lives in the area of Edward's castle) takes him home with her.At first, everybody is intrigued by Edward and they all want to join in on his popularity. From the moment he was wrongfully accused of burglary, the all reject him. Besides the Boggs'family, and more importantly the daughter Kim, they all turn their back to him. Many things in this films could be considered as pure genius. For example the moral that true love comes from within. Edward is considered as a hideous creature by Kim at first. But she realizes that he's the only man that loves her the most. Edward Scissorhands also comments the life in small communities a lot. Gossiping woman meet on the corner, the people look into each others houses...This films really shows the hypocrisy of these people. The locations and decors are outstanding, to say the least. Edwards house and garden are perfect shots of beauty and macabre at the same time. Great work. And finally there are the acting performances. Johnny Depp does his best work under Tim Burton. The 3 film they made ( until now) are just perfect. Also, it's just impossible not to love Dianne Wiest in this film, she's the perfect cast in the role of the loving mother. So is the father played by Alan Arkin. And then there's Winona...Let me tell you, you haven't seen beauty until you see her dancing in the snow.
