It's so... French, and superfluous, and fantastic in every way.It's the story of a girl, Amélie (Audrey Tautou), who grew up in a cold household, and is left lonely, and yet alive in her own mind. She dreams of having a great life, but is too intimidated to do it. That is, until one day when she is prompted to help everyone around her and herself, which means taking the reigns of her life and making her dreams a reality, including chasing after the boy of her dreams (Mathieu Kassovitz).I realize I just used the words girl and boy to describe them, but I'm afraid that's misleading. They're both twentysomethings, or thirtysomethings, I'm not even sure, but they aren't kids in any way. But the story is so childlike and innocent, and yet adult and tainted... It's timeless. I always think about how innocent the movie is, and consider it okay for all to see. I always forget it's rated R. Only for sexual content on a moderate scale, but it's still very present.And it's so brilliant. The director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, knew the material and is as certain a director as say, Baz Luhrmann. Truffaut's Jules et Jim, is very evident in Amélie, in its frantic, kinetic pace and narration, and nifty camera tricks that help to move the story along. He even splices bits of the movie into it.Tautou is simply delightful. I always forget she's acting, and that she's an actress. This isn't her life, it's not the only part she plays. Amélie is a splendid character, one that will go down in movie history, I'm sure of it. The movie is almost universally liked, almost universally uplifting. It's lighthearted and fanciful. It's delightful. You can read almost any review and they'll say the same thing.There are some things that are wonderful, some effects that are distracting. It inspired the traveling gnome commercials. Isn't that worth something? Give this movie a try, I don't know anyone who doesn't like it. I don't know if you can like fun and not like this movie.

It sounds like something out of a 1950's detective noir, but in fact it's just one of the many brilliant lines of dialog in Curtis Hanson's stunning detective drama L.A. Confidential. Set in 1953, L.A. Confidential follows the stories (mainly) of three police officers A sharp, straight laced, political animal, played by Guy Pearce, a violent brute with a hatred of women beaters, played by Russell Crowe, and a smooth talking, part time TV technical adviser, played by Kevin Spacey, all whom are giving A + performances. Other wonderful characters include Captain Dudley Smith, played by James Cromwell, and Veronica lookalike hooker Lynn Bracken, played by Kim Basinger (who won the Oscar).After a horrible shooting at a late night coffee shop in which six people (one of them a former cop) are brutally shot, the rather corrupt L.A.P.D begins an investigation, which leads all three of our main detectives on a winding, dangerous road of murder, Hollywood glamor, and mayhem.The story is crafted brilliantly, with new layers being added to the story as it unfolds. We see how minor characters are connected in ways that are vital to the plot, and how in the end everything fits like a jigsaw puzzle.The screenplay, written by Brian Helgeland and director Curtis Hanson, is top notch, with well rounded characters and cracking dialog. The set direction and costumes are perfect for the 1950's, and the cinematography is beautiful. Overall this is a film which I highly recommend to anyone who likes detectives, period pieces, or just a good story.This is not B.S. I'm telling you. Just the facts.

From the largely successful crude American Pie to the down right tough nut drama Kidulthood there are many versions of how college life is seen. To generalise, most American films centre on the comedy genre when tackling these stories whilst British cinema aims to portray realism, and at the end of the day everything is exaggerated, but is marvellously funny and entertaining nonetheless, and the same goes for this almost American Pie riff.Ryan Reynolds is the main reason to watch as with all his previous roles he brings that contained side of cheekiness to his character and executes his comic timing to perfection with some well spoken phrases and equally amusing physical attributes. Though his comedy isn't on the brilliance of Just friends, he generates a feeling of coolness and gets the laughs that this genre always needs.As these are films about aging students, there are always repetitive ideologies encoded for the preferred reading. So we have sex, parties, losing virginity and complicated relationships. If you thought American Pie was crude, wait till this hits your screen. There is one particular moment that is irrevocable. Lets just say a dog and a spatula get a less than pleasant introduction, not to mention Wilder's sacrifice to get a form to carry on learning. It is definitely crude with that sense of physical comedy that we teens apparently love so much.As there is plenty of comedy there is still enough room to match the cheesy conventional plot that follows the rule book practically word for word. Well, to be fair the plot is springy because of the comedy input, but once more in this genre does a guy have to like the one girl he can't have and it's only going to end up one way. If this was tweaked a bit to add some surprise and energy we may have had a different feeling come the credits and feeling rewarded for the film's diversity, but once more we pay money to see the same concept repeated except with some fresh faces.Apart from the weighing down involvement of the conventional romance ideology, this is a very enjoyable picture. The characters, all pretty much stereotypes, bring their own spice to the plot, especially the teacher and Wilder's assistant Taj. We have the geeks, the jocks, the scientists, the swingers and so forth. All familiar and therefore its easy to transfer into entertainment. There is no silly character development and we are left with simply the person on screen with their own agenda.Van Wilder is a simple crude story wrapped with a wonderful central performance by Reynolds. Where this 2001 picture won't give fans the same satisfaction and buoyancy as American Pie or Euro trip, there is enough crude comedy to reward the target youthful audience for their money.

I am pleased to report that it doesn't. Remarkably, the effect gets stronger with each exposure. This is without a doubt my favorite recent film. The performances are wonderful. This is Quaid's best after his early bloom and nothing he's done since can compare with it. Jim C, well, he is luminous. Indeed, every role is well and truly played. This one is special because it does what the Fountain and a number of other, recent high concept and message films try but usually fail to accomplish in any meaningful fashion. Frequency moves the heart through the experience of film.

The movie stars Basil Rathbone (Sherlock Holmes) as the&#x97;like the title suggests&#x97;the son of Dr. Frankenstein, who was played by Colin Clive in the first two movies. The son of Frankenstein, while investigating the decimated ruins of his father's old laboratory, comes upon the comatose remains of the Frankenstein monster still played by Boris Karloff. In addition, the living corpse of Ygor, played by Bela Lugosi (Dracula) keeps a close eye on his half-living, half-dead companion and uses the new Dr. Frankenstein to return life to the green-skinned creature.Son of Frankenstein is not a very significant horror movie and is not in the same league as the first two movies of the series, but in comparison to a great many of the sequels that followed, it does stand out as one of the few passable entries. I enjoyed this twice as much as I did the 1994 adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein; Rathbone, Karloff, and Lugosi are all very good in this film. I also liked Lionel Atwill as the one-armed, mustached inspector trying to find out what's going on. I also liked the touch of how the villagers have prejudicially turned on Baron Wolf Frankenstein on account of what his father created before him.Now what I did not like, and what cost the movie what was potentially a higher rating, was the long moments of dead space in between the monster sequences. Karloff does not have very much to do in this film; he mostly just lies around or stands around. I also did not find the self-destruction approach of Basil Rathbone's character like I did the one with Colin Clive in the first two Frankenstein pictures. The most interesting thing in the movie is Lugosi as Ygor and it does rival his performance in Dracula (1931). It's just a shame his performance here wasn't in a better, more significant film.Nevertheless, on the whole, I did enjoy Son of Frankenstein and found it a lot more pleasing than a lot of the absurdly ridiculous follow-ups that came after it. No, it's not in the same league as the original Frankenstein (1931) or the surprisingly wonderful Bride of Frankenstein (1935), but very few horror movies are. But it is at the same time a missed opportunity and will probably only work for the fans. I recommend it for three things Rathbone, Karloff, and Lugosi.

It was exactly the Hogwarts I had pictured when reading it, with all of the mystery and fun that I could have hoped for. The casting was also excellently done, and I just adore Maggie Smith! She is excellently portrayed and one of my favorite characters. I was disappointed that the population of Hogwarts wasn't depicted as being more diverse in ethnicity and ages as it was in the book. But one of the things I love the most about Rowling is that she doesn't have ethnic stereotyping in her books at all. There is a wonderful level of diversity in her characters, but she doesn't beat you over the head with it. Race doesn't matter in the world she created; what matters is whether you can do magic and if your parents are pure blooded. It is a really excellent way of having the readers take a step back away from the issue of race to better see the absurdity of judging others by their magical abilities or some other superficiality.Well anyways, this was a good movie for all generations and my son and I really enjoyed it.

Build a baseball field, take out a couple of acres that could grow Iowa corn and some wonderful things will happen. But what those things are, even he can't imagine.Good thing he has the loving support of wife Amy Madigan and daughter Gaby Hoffman. He's got a Grinch of a brother-in-law in Timothy Busfield who is the closest thing to a villain in Field Of Dreams. Busfield is very good in the scenes he's in.The voices also tell Costner to get reclusive writer James Earl Jones in on his obsession and both of them get a mission to track down an obscure major league player from the old New York Giants who got one game in the big leagues and then left to pursue medicine. Burt Lancaster plays the older Archie 'Moonlight' Graham and Frank Whaley plays him as a callow baseball loving youth. Incidentally this was Lancaster's farewell performance on the big screen. For all the many and complex roles that Lancaster did in his career, this part as a simple country doctor, the kind that has vanished from our society is a great screen valedictory. By the way there was a real Moonlight Graham who did play one game for the Giants of John McGraw during the twenties. So that makes another real life person Burt Lancaster portrays on screen. As another member of the Giants at that time Casey Stengel always used to say, 'you could look it up'.So Costner builds his baseball diamond, his Field Of Dreams and so much happens to him and others he's touched. Including a group of suspended players known infamously as the Chicago Black Sox who conspired to throw the 1919 World Series. The degree of complicity in each one of them varied, but the most well known case was that of Shoeless Joe Jackson whose spirit is embodied in Ray Liotta. There's on factual error in here. When you see Swede Risberg in catcher's gear, realize he was the shortstop for the White Sox, he never caught. The catcher for the team was Ray Schalk who is in the Hall of Fame and who was not part of the group that dumped games.More legends surround baseball than all the other sports we Americans follow put together. They are a part of our history as much as the accomplishments of any presidents. Foreigners watching Field Of Dreams might not understand that and a great deal of the film will be lost on them. I'll wager more people will know Ty Cobb's lifetime batting average of .367 than can tell us what certain provisions of the Constitution are where. Then again as Liotta says, Cobb was so disliked in life, he wasn't invited as the ghosts of baseball past play in Costner's Iowa cornfield.And believe me, Field Of Dreams is far from corn.
