Also, if someone in the status of Anjelica's character became a widow, I don't think she would still have been single and raising three children in that period. Also, as someone already mentioned she is shown as a tough, kick-ass girl but spent most of her life never fighting back her family, that i cant really see. Drew does an alright job as Cinderella but ,typical her, she plays the character like a lost, defenseless puppy. Add in the the prince who is played by the miscast Dougray Scott, and you've got one of the worst movie couples. The prince comes off as a boring, one-dimensional, rude, self absorbed idiot. I can only remember chuckling once through the whole movie where the Spanish princess sobbed at the thought of marrying the loser prince. The script is poorly written and the kind of thing only someone 13 and under would really enjoy. Pretty much, save your money and your time and pick ANYTHING else. I would especially recommend The Princess Bride, which has much more wit and humor.

Well, I don't know about that, I certainly wouldn't call it bad, but for me, there isn't that much special about it, or much that gives it much rewatch value.Usually James Cameron uses a cliché premise to tell his story, but adds fun and likable characters. This movie is the opposite, sort of, the plot is better while the characters are really forgettable. I remember four of these characters, the lead male, the lead female, the black chick, and the guy with the rat. I don't get the villains motivation. But probably my biggest problem is that the movie can be very boring. It's very slow, especially in the beginning, and then it just doesn't know when to end. I swear it ends like five times, or should I say, climaxes, each time gets more tedious. And also, this may just be me, but the movie came out in 1989, I know the Cold War didn't officially end until 1991, but wasn't tense relations between the Soviets and the U.S. pretty much done by 1989. And no, sorry, but she would not be able to live after staying underwater that long.The mystery and plot is what makes the movie watchable. Don't get me wrong, it's pretty much a mix between Alien and Micheal Crichton's Sphere. But it's interesting enough to keep you watching. The direction and special effects are great for the most part, but this is James Cameron, so who would be surprised. It has some great action scenes, the best being when the crane falls. And some great moments of atmosphere, including when that rope of water comes in. And it's pretty funny.Basically when stuff starts happening, it gets interesting, but a lot of the characters are forgettable, and it's pacing is all over the place. I know a lot of people love it, but this isn't one I tend to rewatch a lot.6.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"17 August 2011","score":"","review":" Jame's Cameron's the Abyss is often regarded as one of his best movies.

Also at the very end when Simba takes his place as king is just magical, powerful it gives me chills when the bones are washed away by the rain while simba listens the voice of his father remember definitely this is pure gold a movie for old and young and a gem that will absolutely will pass the test of time.

It has a lot to live up to. While the Godfather impresses you before it even starts, with Marlon Brando's iconic face on the poster, Part II has to earn your respect. To most, it equals- and to a few, it betters- the Godfather. But to me, it doesn't. Part II is an exceptional film that outclasses many films, but its predecessor is not one of them.The Godfather showed the rise- or fall, however you look at it- of Michael Corleone, and Part II shows him at the height of his power, and his descent. The story is sprawling, like it should be. Betrayal, family, and oranges, Godfather staples, are seen throughout. But Part II doesn't have the charisma of Part I. Without Vito and Sonny, much of the famous Italian factor is lost. Like Michael, the story is more heartless than before.Also in Part II is the origin of Vito Corleone, starring the then small-time Robert de Niro, in one of his best performances. These scenes are so awesome, they steal the show. When we learn about Vito, we don't want it to end, and when we watch Michael, we wish he was Vito instead. There's so much plot in this film, it could've been cut into 2 films, one a continuation and one an origin story, a la the Metal Gear Solid quadrilogy. Who knows the impact that could've had on the quality of Part III.While the film lacks Sonny or Vito, the characters present are very well played. These actors could be these characters in real life. And when Oscar season came, it showed 5 nominations. Pacino is at his conflicted peak, shown no better than his confrontation with Kay. He is the tent pole all the other characters aren't on his level, another factor that makes me like Part I more. Others got the spotlight. But as I mentioned before, De Niro is the best part of this film. He sounds like the Don, looks, and charms the the Don. The sets of the 20's scenes are breathtaking. It's a pity there isn't a whole film about him.Together, Godfathers I and II are the best films ever made. But separate, I believe the first part stands alone at the top.

The movie is quite hilarious, although unfortunately most of the humor is unintentional. The acting is hit-and-miss, (with a lot of miss) but all in all Romeo + Juliet is entertaining enough.

It starts out a little bit like Wes Craven's New Nightmare being set on a film set, (also like Scream 3).

Only the film comes to life and someone is killing off her crew.That's the basic plot, it's simple and everyone can follow it. This is the type of film girls would watch after Twilight on a sleepover thinking its a really adult, extreme horror film after being mildly scared by Twilight. That means that for the rest of us, the scares are minimal and the action is just enjoyable instead of heart-stopping! However, what I did like was the way it used humour.It was really funny in some places and the black security guard was a hoot baby! So you can't say that this film wasn't fun. What was also fantastic was the ending! I thought I was being very clever in sussing out who the killer was but it took me completely by surprise! Urban Legends Final Cut is a wannabee Scream for a more miniature audience (i.e. 12+) it tries to be clever and sometimes it is but it is fun throughout and never dull.

As a story that's loosely based on Whit Masterson's novel, Badge of Evil, Welles' film is a sweaty puzzler that deals high in corruption, moral ambiguities, betrayal and a whole host of less than honourable human traits, a border town murder mystery craftily cloaked in sleaze, grime and juddering grotesques.As art, film takes some beating, as Welles, aided by cinematographer Russell Metty, gleefully runs amok with low angles, edgy editing, jittery close ups, fluid character frames and of course deep focus compositions. While Henry Mancini's jazz\/rock fusion musical score adds to the edgy tone laid out by the master director. Bookended by brilliance, where the mesmerising opening (preaching to the converted a little) sets the standard that the elegiac ending will follow, Touch of Evil is, however, as a whole not a masterpiece.

I have watched this film many times now and it still brings tears to my eyes. I don't know why because I know the story inside out by now.The story is about Helen, a young PR girl, who is having no luck with her job or with her boyfriend. She shares a home with her wayward boyfriend Gerry, a man who is trying to write his first novel and having a secret affair. At the start of the film she gets sacked from her job and then the film gets very interesting because two story lines develop as she makes her way home. As she gets on the tube, the train's sliding doors close and one story begins, but then the sliding doors open and the alternate story begins. The two stories revolve around Helen and her boyfriend Gerry, and two other people James, and Lydia. One story shows one twist of fate as she misses the train, the other story shows another set of circumstances as she gets on the train. Both stories play out scene by scene in a delightful romantic comedy. It is the great performances by all the cast, a brilliant idea, and a witty script that make this film a classic in its genre in my opinion.As with the best comedy, there is also tragedy that befalls the players in this drama, and you end up realising how complicated life is and how fate plays a big part in our lives.As someone who hates rom coms, I have to say that Sliding Doors is still one of my favourite films, and I watch it whenever it comes on the TV.

Dreamt up following the financial success (or, as they'll tell you down at United Artists, the financial and critical success) of 1977's Star Wars, and it's important to get this out of the way, the film exists purely as a cash-in; a buying into the hype; an investment on the behalf of the company in the hope it will pay out; a placing of one's money within an established field with the hope a little extra will be made on top. The sentiment rings painfully true when we observe the promise at the end of the canon's last instalment, the wonderfully taut The Spy Who Loved Me, during which it was inferred that James Bond would return in For Your Eyes Only &#x96; a direction and an adaptation the makers were clearly already thinking ahead toward, only for the monolith that is the race to cinematic space to kick-in and force the producers down an altogether different route. As a stand alone film, Moonraker comes at us as a perfect encapsulating of this thinking an after-thought, or an excursion; a project we clearly weren't going to undertake but might as well do so now.The film begins with that of a mid-flight shuttle-jacking, as it hitches a ride on that of a British jumbo jet. Its theft is reminiscent, in what is one of a number of unsuccessful riffs on the previous entry, to that of The Spy Who Loved Me's opening and its depiction of a submarine thieving; here, two thuggish stowaways falling out of bunks and blasting off acting as a tepid substitute for agonising panic on board a British sub and the pained expression on its captain's face as he sees what is hidden from our view. Distraught, the British government react and decide to investigate the missing of the shuttle; enter Roger Moore for the fourth time as James Bond, whose obligatory introduction that he wins out over all odds arrives in the form of an impressive sky dive sequence, but would you really wear shades as one man does if you were skydiving? Moore sleepwalks his way through the film which, admittedly, provides him with very little to do but go through motions; he is sent to an initial port of call in the form of French shuttle entrepreneur Hugo Drax (Lonsdale), whom resides in California, and it turns out too quickly is guilty of the crime after all. Whilst there, he meets an American space engineer named Holly Goodhead (Chiles) and she verbally matches him; the opening exchanges moderately pleasingly but without the involving causality involving varying parties after a MacGuffin as was apparent before, where the manner in which Bond and Goodhead try to act as one another's foils throughout does not match up to that of Bach and Moore's interplay from last time out. Very quickly, Moonraker settles into a groove devoid of many thrills. After an establishment that Bond is in no way infallible to the space age, outer hemisphere-orientated stuff on show, that being by way of an unpleasant encounter in a G-force machine, the film opens up into a plot of sorts largely consisting of fight scenes and skirmishes; these range from an unfortunate encounter with a funeral barge to that of an, admittedly, well choreographed martial arts sequence in a museum and its attic, but it is exclusively the second unit stuff driving this entry. Bond will charge to places such as Venice and the Brazilian rain forest, gradually putting together clues that allude to something a whole lot more sinister than just a case of a missing rocket, but it sounds more exciting and more roomy than it is &#x96; this being the Bond film in which the hero covers a lot of ground without there actually feeling like an awful lot of ground is being covered. Other highlights include a bunch of inconsequential allusions to other science fiction films, although a cable car fight is rather good, as well as a truly bizarre sequence in which a siren leads Bond into a python's pit surrounded by other glamorous women - an apparent punishment for Bond in what has been a leering attitude towards most up to this point. On the gadgeted side of things, and where a car-turned-submarine rolled out of the sea in a remarkable instance in the last entry, Bond here drives a gondola-turned-automobile through a Venician square, in what is one of the more distressing riffs on the previous effort which in no way carries the majesty of before.Lewis Gilbert is the unfortunate individual ushered in to direct it; a film very much distancing itself from any essence of creative licence or core subscription to the belief of filmmakers coming in and making material their own. Much nearer the end, when the ethic of whether or not a supervillian has room for his often scarred; often freakish henchmen in the bold new order of flawlessness is challenged for what might be the first time in the series, the hulking lackey Jaws, famously played by Richard Kiel, has a change of heart and decides to join Bond and his female accomplice in trying to thwart the dastardly bad guys. Such a happening is the result, not of careful deliberation in reaction to how a specific text or framework might naturally evolve, but of audience demand; because the public liked the character so much, they desired a reason to root for him away from his primary concern of having to kill Bond and his allies. Such a decision veers directing, indeed filmmaking, away from that of films at the hands of auteurs and into a more submissive realm of 'what the audience want, they get; desire for a creative mark or not'. Moonraker? More like box-ticker.

Whilst there, he meets an American space engineer named Holly Goodhead (Chiles) and she verbally matches him; the opening exchanges moderately pleasingly but without the involving causality involving varying parties after a MacGuffin as was apparent before, where the manner in which Bond and Goodhead try to act as one another's foils throughout does not match up to that of Bach and Moore's interplay from last time out. Very quickly, Moonraker settles into a groove devoid of many thrills. After an establishment that Bond is in no way infallible to the space age, outer hemisphere-orientated stuff on show, that being by way of an unpleasant encounter in a G-force machine, the film opens up into a plot of sorts largely consisting of fight scenes and skirmishes; these range from an unfortunate encounter with a funeral barge to that of an, admittedly, well choreographed martial arts sequence in a museum and its attic, but it is exclusively the second unit stuff driving this entry. Bond will charge to places such as Venice and the Brazilian rain forest, gradually putting together clues that allude to something a whole lot more sinister than just a case of a missing rocket, but it sounds more exciting and more roomy than it is &#x96; this being the Bond film in which the hero covers a lot of ground without there actually feeling like an awful lot of ground is being covered. Other highlights include a bunch of inconsequential allusions to other science fiction films, although a cable car fight is rather good, as well as a truly bizarre sequence in which a siren leads Bond into a python's pit surrounded by other glamorous women - an apparent punishment for Bond in what has been a leering attitude towards most up to this point. On the gadgeted side of things, and where a car-turned-submarine rolled out of the sea in a remarkable instance in the last entry, Bond here drives a gondola-turned-automobile through a Venician square, in what is one of the more distressing riffs on the previous effort which in no way carries the majesty of before.Lewis Gilbert is the unfortunate individual ushered in to direct it; a film very much distancing itself from any essence of creative licence or core subscription to the belief of filmmakers coming in and making material their own.

Dreamt up following the financial success (or, as they'll tell you down at United Artists, the financial and critical success) of 1977's Star Wars, and it's important to get this out of the way, the film exists purely as a cash-in; a buying into the hype; an investment on the behalf of the company in the hope it will pay out; a placing of one's money within an established field with the hope a little extra will be made on top. The sentiment rings painfully true when we observe the promise at the end of the canon's last instalment, the wonderfully taut The Spy Who Loved Me, during which it was inferred that James Bond would return in For Your Eyes Only &#x96; a direction and an adaptation the makers were clearly already thinking ahead toward, only for the monolith that is the race to cinematic space to kick-in and force the producers down an altogether different route. As a stand alone film, Moonraker comes at us as a perfect encapsulating of this thinking an after-thought, or an excursion; a project we clearly weren't going to undertake but might as well do so now.The film begins with that of a mid-flight shuttle-jacking, as it hitches a ride on that of a British jumbo jet. Its theft is reminiscent, in what is one of a number of unsuccessful riffs on the previous entry, to that of The Spy Who Loved Me's opening and its depiction of a submarine thieving; here, two thuggish stowaways falling out of bunks and blasting off acting as a tepid substitute for agonising panic on board a British sub and the pained expression on its captain's face as he sees what is hidden from our view. Distraught, the British government react and decide to investigate the missing of the shuttle; enter Roger Moore for the fourth time as James Bond, whose obligatory introduction that he wins out over all odds arrives in the form of an impressive sky dive sequence, but would you really wear shades as one man does if you were skydiving?

I must've completely missed the brilliance of The Idiots because to me it seemed like an even more pointless Jackass, watching pathetic idiots acting like mentally ill people by spazzing in public to find their inner idiot. There is little and almost no plot at all. It's a character piece, focusing on really unlikable people who have little interesting about them.The shaky camera seems entirely unnecessary with the boom mic and camera reflection clearly visible in some shots. The directing simply has no directing. Some intellectuals might consider it sponataneous and different but it's pointless and off-putting. The screenplay is also a complete mess. Maybe something got lost in translation but I couldn't particularly understand what was going on and what the point was of there actions.I also would not recommend watching this with other people because watching it by yourself is awkward enough. The final scene is really intense and not the good intense like Black Swan but really awkward and uncomfortable intense. It's horrible to watch and quite upsetting and I don't know why anyone would want their audience to feel that way. The reason for the extra mark was just for the power of the last scene and how the whole experience of seeing the film will take a while for me to forget.Intellectuals will only like The Idiots, they will see things I can't see because to me it's a confusing, boring and senseless piece of film making with some disgusting imagery and perverted writing.

I must've completely missed the brilliance of The Idiots because to me it seemed like an even more pointless Jackass, watching pathetic idiots acting like mentally ill people by spazzing in public to find their inner idiot. There is little and almost no plot at all. It's a character piece, focusing on really unlikable people who have little interesting about them.The shaky camera seems entirely unnecessary with the boom mic and camera reflection clearly visible in some shots. The directing simply has no directing. Some intellectuals might consider it sponataneous and different but it's pointless and off-putting. The screenplay is also a complete mess. Maybe something got lost in translation but I couldn't particularly understand what was going on and what the point was of there actions.I also would not recommend watching this with other people because watching it by yourself is awkward enough. The final scene is really intense and not the good intense like Black Swan but really awkward and uncomfortable intense. It's horrible to watch and quite upsetting and I don't know why anyone would want their audience to feel that way. The reason for the extra mark was just for the power of the last scene and how the whole experience of seeing the film will take a while for me to forget.Intellectuals will only like The Idiots, they will see things I can't see because to me it's a confusing, boring and senseless piece of film making with some disgusting imagery and perverted writing. Stay clear of The Idiots like you'd stay clear of an idiot.

He deliberately adds scenes that aren't needed at all just to create shock from the public, he did it in Antichrist by placing a pornographic 3 second shock of graphic sex. Here he's decided to do it again by adding idiotic images like a fully erect penis and a pornographic sex scene. They may not be very long shots but they are simply disgusting and not needed. This film has confirmed to me that Lars Von Trier, how ever good a film-maker he is, is a pervert!

Basically in the 18th Century, in a small Irish village, Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) is the young farm boy who lost his father who was killed in a duel concerning a horse sale, and he is in love with his cousin Nora Brady (Gay Hamilton). He gets into a duel himself against Captain John Quin (Leonard Rossiter) who wants to marry her, and of course Barry refuses to back off, but he apparently kills his opponent, forcing him to flee to Dublin. On the way he is robbed by famous highwayman Captain Feeny (Ryan's Daughter's Arthur O'Sullivan), and with no money he joins the British army, there he finds out from friend Captain Grogan (Godfrey Quigley) that Quin is alive, and the whole thing was staged to get rid of him and marry Nora and restore her family's fortune. Barry is sent to fight in the Seven Years' War, where Grogan dies from a wound against the French, so he steals a higher rank's uniform and passes through Holland, encountering Prussian Captain Potzdorf (Hardy Krüger) who knows he is in disguise, and threatens to kill him unless he joins the Prussian army. The war ends and he next joins the Prussian Police and a servant for professional gambler Chevalier De Balibari (Patrick Magee), and after discovering he is not a spy and Irish they become professional cheaters of cards until being expelled. Barry next seduces the beautiful and wealthy Lady Honoria, Countess of Lyndon (Marisa Berenson) and after the death of her elderly husband Sir Charles Lyndon (Frank Middlemass) he is able to marry her, and changing his name to Barry Lyndon. Ten year old Bullingdon (Dominic Savage), son of Sir Charles, hates Barry for marrying his mother, and their marriage is unhappy, but they do have a son together, Bryan Patrick (David Morley), and Barry enjoys spending all the money, and being unfaithful, which he apologises for. Years later Barry's Mother (Marie Kean) comes to live with them, and she warns him that if the Countess was to die the fortune would pass onto now young man Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali). To help stop this happening he gets himself a better title with the help of Lord Gustavus Adolphus Wendover (André Morell), spending money getting himself to the top, but his efforts are wasted, and Lord Bullington announces his hatred for his stepfather at Lady Lyndon's birthday party. Barry's public cruelty loses him some reputation and powerful friends, he is somewhat shunned from society, but he makes up for it being a good father to Bryan who he cannot refuse any gift, he even buys him a new horse for his ninth birthday. Bryan ignores the wish to not take the horse out and is thrown off and dies a few days later, and filled with grief Barry becomes an alcoholic, while his wife turns to religion, with the assistance of family tutor Reverend Samuel Runt (Murray Melvin). After Lady Lyndon is heard to have attempted suicide due to continuing grief, Lord Bullington returns from places unknown and wants revenge in a duel against his stepfather, and after starting slow he does manage to shoot Barry in his leg, meaning his leg below the knee is amputated. Bullington takes over while his stepfather recovers, and he sends accountant Graham (Philip Stone) to make him an offer and force him out of England forever and end the marriage to his mother, or he will never again get any of the family money and go to jail. With no choice and exhausted Barry agrees, sees his mother, tries to gamble for more money without success, and Barry given the cheque from Lady Lyndon who he never sees again and Bullington looking on as he leaves for good. Narrated by Michael Hordern, also starring Steven Berkoff as Lord Ludd, Diana Körner as Lischen, Billy Boyle as Seamus Feeny and Worzel Gummidge's Anthony Sharp as Lord Hallam. As the title character O'Neal gives a marvellous performance as the man passing through the years in the British aristocracy and faced with many different confrontations and situations, and many other cast members give great performances as well, director Kubrick of course creates perfect pacing, a very intriguing story with many elements and memorable moments, and you can forgive it for being nearly three hours, a most watchable period drama. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Music for Leonard Rosenman, and it was nominated for Best Picture and Best Writing, Screenplay Adapted From Other Material for Kubrick, it won the BAFTA for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama.
