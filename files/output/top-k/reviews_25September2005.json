I hadn't noticed up to then, being absorbed by trying to decide if the animation was actually very good, or very bad. But she was right. People die all over the place here. Not just casual, in-the-distance deaths either. People get drowned, are trapped and die in water-tight compartments, are even set on fire, for goodness sake!

I can remember a similar incident with Disney's Dinosaur movie. All the mothers and toddlers trooping in to watch it, then a number coming out horrified after ten minutes once the meteor scene arrives, kids crying at all the little monkeys getting killed.What this all says about what we let our kids watch these days is, I'm sure, a debate that will continue indefinitely.

Contrary to popular belief...there is actually no evidence that Lewis Carroll ever took any Hallucinogenic substances or narcotic substances in his life. The Lewis Carroll institute has preserved many of Carrolls letters and memoirs and none of these have references about Carroll experimenting with any substance. Remember also that back in the 19th century no substances were actually illegal so there wouldn't have been any incentive for Carroll NOT to mention these in any of his letters. Now...there goes without saying that there are numerous questionable scenes in both the book and this cartoon which certainly can be interpreted as being a subliminal drug message. My particular favorite in the cartoon would have to be when Alice meets up with the caterpillar who is smoking a hooka on top of a large mushroom and the caterpillar changes color several times...As well as Alice eating a mushroom to become Taller or smaller. But like I said no actual evidence exists that this story was inspired by drug trips despite the popular culture opinion that it was.That being said...like I said the Dialouge in this cartoon is extremely dated...and the music mostly campy and unmemorable.

He goes away for a couple of years but not without leaving her pregnant. There's an older guy, richer guy in love with her for whom until now she had no time. She levels about her situation and he marries her anyway and raises the child as his own. Now, hands up all those who said 'That's Marius by Marcel Pagnol, the first part of his great trilogy'. While you're wiping the egg off your faces I'll try a less frivolous take. IF Pagnol had been born in the North instead of the South of France it's just feasible that he may have written a story set in the Northern French port of Cherbourg, called his male protagonist Guy and not Marius, had him conscripted into the army for his obligatory two years National Service spent in Algeria and called his female protagonist Genvieve instead of Fanny. Jacques Demy may well have had Marius in mind albeit subconsciously when he wrote and directed The Umbrellas Of Cherbourg - and it was, incidentally, just about the same time that Harold Rome wrote the words and music for a condensed and musical version of Pagnol's trilogy which, as 'Fanny' was produced on Broadway by David Merrick - but nobody creates in a vacuum and Demy has come up with a charming, not to say enchanting movie. How referential it actually is can be left to the quasi-academic pseuds but it might be worth noting in passing Demy's self-referential nod to his earlier equally romantic movie 'Lola' in which the character of Roland Cossard (played here by the same actor, Marc Michel) was the protagonist in love with Anouk Aimee's eponymous Lola, the background music was also by Michel Legrand whose main love theme turns up again here. Younger viewers will most likely be unaware of the two half-decent lyrics that were written for the two main themes of Umbrellas and enjoyed no little success as respectively 'I Will Wait For You' and 'Watch What Happens' and those who DO remember will marvel at the banality of Demy's original words - 'lyrics' may be stretching it. It might be interesting to discover which came first, Demy's pedestrian words or Legrand's lush melodies. It's fun at that to imagine Legrand, faced with something like 'pass the salt', 'it looks like a nice day', 'the girls are wearing their hair shorter this year', etc and coming up with those gorgeous melodies (I'd rather not dwell on the opposite). Ultimately this is a movie it's hard not to like, from the muted pastels, reminiscent of Les Grands Manouvres, to the Audrey Hepburn-lite sub-Givenchy outfits worn by Deneuve and Ann Vernon as her mother.

","genre":null},{"date":"25 September 2005","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Okay, here's a superficial smart-ass take on this entry We're in a French port, there's a guy who loves a gal and a gal who loves him right back, arguably she loves him just a tad more than he loves her. He goes away for a couple of years but not without leaving her pregnant. There's an older guy, richer guy in love with her for whom until now she had no time. She levels about her situation and he marries her anyway and raises the child as his own. Now, hands up all those who said 'That's Marius by Marcel Pagnol, the first part of his great trilogy'. While you're wiping the egg off your faces I'll try a less frivolous take. IF Pagnol had been born in the North instead of the South of France it's just feasible that he may have written a story set in the Northern French port of Cherbourg, called his male protagonist Guy and not Marius, had him conscripted into the army for his obligatory two years National Service spent in Algeria and called his female protagonist Genvieve instead of Fanny. Jacques Demy may well have had Marius in mind albeit subconsciously when he wrote and directed The Umbrellas Of Cherbourg - and it was, incidentally, just about the same time that Harold Rome wrote the words and music for a condensed and musical version of Pagnol's trilogy which, as 'Fanny' was produced on Broadway by David Merrick - but nobody creates in a vacuum and Demy has come up with a charming, not to say enchanting movie. How referential it actually is can be left to the quasi-academic pseuds but it might be worth noting in passing Demy's self-referential nod to his earlier equally romantic movie 'Lola' in which the character of Roland Cossard (played here by the same actor, Marc Michel) was the protagonist in love with Anouk Aimee's eponymous Lola, the background music was also by Michel Legrand whose main love theme turns up again here. Younger viewers will most likely be unaware of the two half-decent lyrics that were written for the two main themes of Umbrellas and enjoyed no little success as respectively 'I Will Wait For You' and 'Watch What Happens' and those who DO remember will marvel at the banality of Demy's original words - 'lyrics' may be stretching it. It might be interesting to discover which came first, Demy's pedestrian words or Legrand's lush melodies.

The plot holes are bad in this film. The social commentary is pretty weak too. And just how many recently unburied dead are there in the cities or anywhere in the US? Since only unburied recently dead were brought back to zombie status, there must have been a killing spree before the Venus probe blew up. Why do characters keep forgetting to aim for the head after hearing the news on how to kill the zombies and after their own experience? Why did it take so long for the parents to come back as zombies after they died when the report said it only takes minutes for the zombie to come back? How come the woman at the top of the stairs never came back? Why if the young couple are burned to death is their flesh and muscles, etc not cooked? Ben is shot well before he comes to window so George could have established better that the Cops knew he may not have been a zombie. Not the movie I remember, sad really.

As a young man he moves out to the West Coast and discovers sun, sex and drugs in a big way. Without a job to bring in money, George and his friends start selling weed locally before realising the market back east in the university areas. From here he grows within his market and is soon flying in larger amounts, before eventually getting captured. However jail brings more opportunities as his cellmate provides a connection to a supply of cocaine and a whole different world.As far back as it could remember, this film wanted to be Goodfellas. From the very start and regularly all the way through this film has the feel of that film although it is never as good as the film that it seems to emulate. The approach is the same and it more or less works but only enough to keep things moving and never to the point where it is a great film. I'm not sure why but it doesn't flow naturally enough and feels longer than it really is, while at the same time never being weighty enough to be the crime semi-epic that it aspires to be at times. It isn't dull by any means but it just didn't do it for me and I didn't get engaged by it to the degree that I had hoped I would. The direction is OK but the feeling that Demme watched Goodfellas about 20 times before making this just kept putting me off.Depp's performance is serviceable but for someone of his ability this is not good enough. For the majority of the film it looks like he has fallen into his hair and he seems just as unnatural within his skin &#150; never able to really draw out a character of any genuine depth. Cruz comes late in the game and does liven things up with a flamboyant performance but she doesn't have any depth either. Support from Liotta is OK but he doesn't manage to do much with a working stiff character and Griffiths just doesn't look old enough for her character. The rest of the cast are OK but really the film is Depp's and it speaks volumes that he doesn't dominate it in the way he has with other films.Overall this is an OK film but it is not slick, engaging or deep enough to be as good as the films that it clearly thinks it can match. The cast all work but don't make much impact and Demme's direction feels copied from other, better, directors. OK but not great.
