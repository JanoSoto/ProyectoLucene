He's given masterpieces like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Jurassic Park, The Lost World, A.I. Artificial Intelligence (Which I technically classify as Kubrick, not Spielberg), War of the Worlds, and ET The Extra-Terrestial. One of his latest films is Minority Report, a twisted different type of Sci-fi.What if You were arrested for a Crime you didn't commit...yet? That's the plot of Minority Report. In the distant future John Anderton, head of the Precrime Unit of the Washington DC Police, a special unit that uses three psychics who can predict murders three days away to brutally detain people who haven't committed crimes yet. Then one day John discovers the next murder to be stopped is to be committed by HIM. Big trouble. Escaping Precrime as fast as he can and being pursued by his own team, Anderton tries to figure who he is to murder and why.Minority Report is Spielberg's most twisted film. He bombards us with creepy and deranged images that will literally scare the heck out of you. Tom Cruise's performance as a burned-out druggie cop is uncomfortable sometimes while Samantha Morton will make your blood run cold with her chilling performance as Agatha. Max von Sydow is awesome and saves this film as the grim-faced Lamarr Burgess. Peter Stormare also has a guest-star appearance that is pure sickening as he operates on Anderton, removing his eyes and replacing them with new ones. John Williams's score is a poor attempt at an action score and I think Spielberg should have just given in and let Hans Zimmer write the score instead of sticking with Williams, who I feel has lost most of his touch...with the exceptions of Star Wars Episodes I, II, and III. The drug use, the creepy characters, the twisted script, it's just too much for one movie. Think twice before renting unless you like watching deranged movies.Signed, The Constant DVD Collector ","genre":null},{"date":"19 September 2006","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Dear Readers,Steven Spielberg is well-known in the science fiction realm.

The film shows an impressive and warped view of the future that only John Carpenter can deliver. Kurt Russell is awesome as Snake Plissken while Donald Plescance is wimpy as heck as the President of the United States and Issac Hayes is great as the Duke of New York.While flying over New York City Penitentiary Island, Air Force One crashes and the president is captured along with a tape that will solve the world's energy crisis. The Duke of New York demands that all the denizens of New York be released and the President will be returned. Instead of sending in their own men, the Security force of New York sends in an ex-war-veteran-turned-bounty-hunter, Snake Plissken. To make sure he cooperates, Plissken is injected with explosives into his neck arteries that will detonate in 24 hours, killing Snake instantly.Signed, The Constant DVD Collector ","genre":null},{"date":"19 September 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Dear Readers, The only John Carpenter film I've ever watch and wanted to watch was Escape from New York.

James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd conspired together to create a brilliant action sci-fi B-Movie. They created one of the most popular Science Fiction\/Action\/Drama movie series of all time. I watched The Terminator because I heard it was good from other people, reviews, and my dad. I thought it was good but there were scenes I felt were quite disgusting. Basically it was like watching the Punisher all over again, only it was less graphic.Sarah Connor is having a bad day. She has a terrible waitress job, her roomie basically kicked her out because of her date, and there's a robot that looks human out to kill her. Teaming up with Future Soldier Kyle Reese, she battles the Terminator Robot in the streets of Los Angeles to save mankind from destruction and to prevent the Rise of the Machines and Skynet.The Terminator was one awesome film. It was a A-Grade movie in a B-Grade wrapping. Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfect as the Terminator while Linda Hamilton is funny and sweet as Sarah. It's Michael Biehn who steals the scenes as Kyle Reese, a gruff young soldier from the Future sent back by Sarah's son to protect Sarah from getting killed. However the violence in this film is a little gratuitous. For starters, a guy get his heart ripped out, the Terminator cuts out his own eye, and dogs get shot to death. Nice movie. Don't even think about letting your kids near this movie. Ever. Stick to Star Wars and Star Trek and if you want to show your kids a good James Cameron film, watch the Abyss Director's Cut.Signed, The Constant DVD Collector ","genre":null},{"date":"19 September 2006","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Dear Readers,The Second movie he did was the Terminator.

It's also one of the most violent. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the stony faced T-800 who's been reprogrammed to protect John Connor from the T-1000, a shape-shifting Terminator. Terminator and John rescue Sarah Connor from a psych ward and arm up to destroy Cyberdyne Systems and their experiments on the first Terminator that came to our time.T2 was great but I felt it was very draining and violent. Arnold Schwarzenegger is nicer in this film and also a little more funnier then his grim-faced version in The Terminator. Young Edward Furlong was awesome as John Connor, using the mind of a child to explain the world to The Terminator. It was Sarah who surprised me though. Gone is the frizzy haired clumsy and funny waitress and in her place is a tough, hardened, paranoid warrior with ice in her veins. Most of the Film is relatively good, but some of the fight scenes go overboard. It's a must watch whether you've seen Terminator 1 or not.Signed, The Constant DVD Collector ","genre":null},{"date":"19 September 2006","score":"","review":" Dear Readers, T2 Judgment Day is one of the best sequels ever made.
