Although it's difficult for me to decide whether I liked this one or MONSTERS, INC. (9\/10) more, I think SHREK is slightly better.First of all, the four lead voices in this film are perfect for their respective roles. Eddie Murphy and John Lithgow stood out especially to me. Eddie Murphy is hilarious as Donkey. He definitely had the funniest lines in the movie and he easily stole the show. Eddie Murphy, it would seem, is ideal for voice-over work. And John Lithgow is perfect for the role of Lord Farquaad, the stuck-up villain of the film who wants to be king. Lithgow makes him sound evil, but funny at the same time. Mike Myers gave the best voice anyone could have given for the lead character Shrek, and Cameron Diaz can best be described as cute, which is perfect for her character, Princess Fiona.I love the way the story uses all the classic fairy tale characters to make this modern-day fairy tale. The beauty and the beast-like romance between Shrek and Princess Fiona really works, even better than most romance movies I've seen as of late. And of course, this movie has laughs galore! I found myself laughing out loud many times, especially at Donkey, the Matrix spoofs, and the little inside jokes that some of the younger viewers might not understand.This one is definitely a film for all ages. I hope it wins the first Oscar for an Animated Film this year (although I'd be happy if MONSTERS, INC. won, too). I've watched this movie a few times since I bought the DVD a few days ago, and it only gets funnier and better every time I see it.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 November 2001","score":"","review":"  Although I loved TOY STORY and A BUG'S LIFE, SHREK did not look too appealing to me when it first came out.

Camera!  Action!  What makes a good movie?  Better yet, what makes a great movie?  In my opinion, a great movie should include almost flawless acting, a finely woven and gripping plot, music that is both beautiful and suitable, and great direction. Of course,  mesmerizing visuals and art direction can also contribute to great films.  So, for all the reasons above, I consider The City Of Lost Children the best film of 1996.The plot of The City Of Lost Children is completely original and it never lets your mind wander off to other places.  It also involves quite a few fascinating and somewhat weird characters in a dreary harbor town called The City Of Lost Children (hence the title).   One(that is his name) is a slow-minded circus strongman who searches for his adopted little brother who has been kidnapped by a group of henchmen with robotic eyes called the Cyclops.  One's little brother has been kidnapped and taken to a quickly aging mad scientist named Krank so that his dreams may be stolen.  The mad scientist needs the dreams of children so that he will not age so quickly. The source of this problem is a curse that was put upon him.  Because of this curse, his wife is a midget, he cannot dream, and he has seven identical sons (all of whom have a strange sleeping disorder).  In this movie there is somewhat of a subplot that involves a wicked pair of unseparated siamese twin sisters.  These women run a sort of school where they have the children in it steal for them.  One small, but tough, girl named Miette runs away from the school, finds One, and aides him in his search.  When the two women find out about their little thief, they go to Marcello, a retired man who used to run a circus freakshow, to get what they need to catch and kill the little girl and her newfound friend.  Although this plot seems a bit hard to follow, it all fits together perfectly in the end with wondrous results.  To accompany this odd story,  there is a beautiful soundtrack composed by Angelo Badalmenti with one song (Who Will Take Your Dreams Away) by Marianne Faithful.  This music fits the mood and plot of the story perfectly and stays with you(as does the movie itself) long after the credits have rolled.The casting director of The City Of Lost Children, Pierre-Jacques Benochou, sure knew what he was doing, because there is not one poor (or mediocre one, for that matter) performance in the whole film.  In fact, I might just say all the performances were virtually flawless.  Ron Perlman's performance as the slow and dimwitted circus strongman One is beautifully acted.  Mr. Perlman should especially be recognized because he is an American actor and this is a subtitled French film.  Daniel Emilfork as the depressed and dreamless mad scientist with a short temper is outstanding and most believable.  Dominique Pinon is wonderful (perhaps the best actor in the whole movie) as the seven rubberfaced identical brothers (yes, he does play all of them, and with fantastic results, too).  The two different actresses who portray the siamese twins, Odile Mallet and Genevieve Brunet, are perfectly wicked and their timing is impeccable.  Last, but not least, the children, with Judith Vittet as Miette in a stand-out performance, all carry out their roles with smashing results.Another reason for me choosing The City Of Lost Children as the best movie of 1996 is its stunning direction.  This movie was directed by the famous French directing team of Jean Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro(a.k.a. Jeunet and Caro).  The camera angles that are used during the course of this film are a totally different experience and they keep you mesmerized from start to finish.  The directors of this film are, in my opinion, masters of the camera.  The visuals in this movie also contributed to my conclusion that this is the best movie of 1996.  Whatever it might have been, whether the bleak and unique use of colors or the special effects, I was absolutely captivated by what I was seeing on the screen.  What I particularly liked about this film's special effects was that they were not the typical flashy and in-your-face computer special effects that some of today's blockbusters and other genre films seem to have.  I think such special effects distract you from the rest of the movie.  On the contrary, the special effects of The City Of Lost Children, however, are very subtle.  A final thing I liked about this film were its sets.  From the waterlogged streets of the dank and moldy town to the spectacular gadgetry of Krank's laboratories everything was a magnificent panorama for the eye to behold.Was the plot great?  Yes.  How was the acting?  Outstanding.  Was the direction done well?  Definitely.  How did the visuals appear?  They were beautifully presented.  From what you have read, whether you have concluded to avoid this movie completely or go out and rent it right away (I do understand that this movie does have a select audience), I am hopeful that you understand the picture I am trying to paint.  Even if the story will not appeal to you, it is still splendidly done.  Overall, though, The City Of Lost Children is definitely the best movie of 1996 for me.

Basically, I went in to see a lot of cool fighting and SFX and that's exactly what I got. But I must admit, that after leaving the theatre, my higher brain functions kicked in. And all I could think about was how they pitifully wasted a good nucleus of a story. The director\/writer\/producer had lots of SFX, an intriguing Sci-Fi premise, DeRoy Lindo and the action star Jet Li. All they had to do was write a decent script. That's all. And this film truly could have been the one. (I apologize for that, I just couldn't help myself.) Instead, everything we learn about the multiverse is expository. They could have, at the very least, showed us the incident that got Yulaw started on his maniacal quest to begin with. Never before have I had so much respect for DeRoy Lindo. It was obvious that he was the only real actor in the bunch and that he did the best he could with the campy material. Everything in the story with the exception of the fight scenes is derivative. I could go on and write something about the horrible script, plot holes, obscene use of the soundtrack, movie cliches, and one-dimensional characters, but I won't.Instead....The fighting was kick-ass! My only quibble is that I wished they would have instant replayed fight scenes at normal speed to make Gabe's\/Yulaw's powers appear more realistic (despite being impossible, of course). Slowing things down gets annoying actually. The coolest fight scene wasn't even the predictable show down, but the one with the police motorcycles. Too bad, even that felt truncated.In sum, all of the criticisms that I heard about The One were totally valid, but I simply liked the film for what it was, an ass-kicking vehicle.

The graphic sex scenes and ultraviolence means that only mature viewers should see this movie, or those who can understand the true meaning behind the film. The novel was written as a warning against totalitarianism that Burgess believed was taking root in England, perhaps after having read of Ingsoc in George Orwell's 1984. This is introduced in the book by Alex's first victim, the drunk in the tunnel. (Its no world for an old man any longer. Men on the moon, and men spinning around the earth like it might be midges round a lamp, and no attention payed to earthly law nor order no more.) Alex thrives in this society, until he has to reap the consequences of what he has done. Then, he attempts to find the easy way out and ends up in more trouble. As Mario Falsetto said in his book Stanley Kubrick A Narrative and Stylistic Analysis the irony is that the Ludovico Treatment would work if society itself were not inherently vicious.Kubrick's genius with film presents these complicated ideas wonderfully. During the Thames Embankment scene, two slow zooms, one into Alex's face and the other into the water, give the effect of Alex's depressed state beautifully. The use of wide-angle lenses at extreme angles, such as when F. Alexander realizes that Alex is the one who raped and murdered his wife, give a very disturbing effect indeed. Kubrick also uses POV shot\/reverse shot sequences to give the viewer a sense that Alex is the one not only narrating the story, but living it as well. Many of the scenes in the movie are seen from Alex's perspective.All in all, this movie is a very thought-provoking essay on human nature and human imperfection. Although some may denounce it as raising violence onto a pedestal, I believe that if you pay careful attention to the movie the tone is not one of anarchism. It is more of a somber realization that although violence is a terrible thing, the fascistic means that the Government used to get rid of it were worse. This is evidenced by when the Minister of the Interior is showing Alex off to see the effects of the Ludovico Treatment, he begins speaking like a droog. (Enough of words, actions speak louder than.

One such film is Rushmore, starring Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, and Olivia Williams.\tRushmore is an extremely well written movie about obsessive love.  It tells the story of Max Fischer (Schwartzman), who is a sophomore at the elitist Rushmore Academy, and is so absorbed in his extracurricular activities that he is in danger of failing out.  One day Max hears a speech by Mr. Blume (Murray), a wealthy businessman who has sons attending Rushmore, and they almost immediately befriend each other.  This oddball relationship between the lonely tycoon and the over-optimistic teenager begins to grow, but then Max discovers a beautiful young widow named Miss Cross (Williams) teaching first grade.  Max becomes very attached to her, but of course she is not as attracted to him, and things get more complicated when Max introduces Mr. Blume to Miss Cross.  I'll leave it at that.\tThe acting is a quality of Rushmore that contributes greatly to its appeal.  I've seen a lot of Bill Murray movies, an I've always had a high opinion of him.

Billy Crystal is surprisingly good as the Gravedigger, and Robin Williams is quite acceptable in as Osric, but Jack Lemmmon...I don't know. Anyway's i wish more than anything this film was on DVD, because it is THE Hamlet to own, which is saying a lot, because Olivier's verson is amazing as well. Possibly the best Shakespeare adaptation of any kind...

The cinematography & style of directing is also first rate. Unfortunately the same can't be said of the script. The twist is very obvious & the film does not have anything else to say really in terms of plot. Also what I found annoying was the way the script tried to compensate for the holes in the twist. How could a man not know he is dead? Why can't he see other dead people? Well lets neatly answer that one for you!  They don't see each other. They only see what they want to see. They don't know they're dead. Despite this it is worth seeing. As already mentioned the cast are all excellent & although this is his first major feature Shyamalan has already established a distinct directorial style. His next film Unbreakable is a far better movie which doesn't just rely on a gimmicky twist ending .Although it does come with a twist in the tail its plot has much more to offer.

The ground is patrolled by underground robots called Screamers who target anyone not wearing identifying marks. One side receives a plea for peace negotiations after 10 years of war and discover from a lost soldier that the war has been forgotten on earth. The two sides have been left to die on Sirius 6B while another way is started on another planet. Commander Hendricksson (Weller) sets out with the lost soldier Jefferson (Lauer) to contact the other side and declare peace. However what they find will spell the end of their war one way or another.This is based on a Phillip K. Dick story and has all the intelligence you would expect from a sci-fi from him - this is not a gory horror movie. This is an intelligent story about the creation of the Screamers and their evolution. It also has a cynical edge lended by the way that the soldiers have been deserted by their leaders and continue to be tricked into fighting while the leaders get on with their business.Weller is excellent as the world weary commander who finds his life sold out from under him. The supporting cast are OK with their stereotyped characters but the real stars are the Screamers who start out by small things with saw-blades and gradually take other forms. The child versions of Screamers are particularly creepy and perhaps a little disturbing.However this is not as terrifying as it should be, nor is it as intelligent as it starts out being.  The whole issue behind the different screamers is not explained and towards the end they just keep popping up without reason!  It also has one of those watch out for the sequel style endings - although in fairness it isn't quite as bad as that.  The special effects are a bit ropey but do the job - after all this is a very low budget movie.The whole thing is not as good as it could have been but is certainly head and shoulders above a lot of low budget sci-fi thrillers.
