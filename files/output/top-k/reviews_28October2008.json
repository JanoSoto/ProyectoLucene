Even the set of Short Circuit didn't have this much robot security.... I guess back in the 80's it made perfect sense to have high powered robots guard malls due to the Robocop craze and all, but did this mall really need 3 robots?**SPOILERS**In a nutshell Chopping Mall is a ridiculous 80's movie about killer robot security guards murdering teenagers who are trapped in a mall for a night. And although this movie is called Chopping Mall when you get down to it there is no actual chopping of any kind in this movie, but the mall part is accurate and the title is such a great play on words I guess they figured the dirtballs who rented this movie wouldn't split hairs. The opening scene shows the unveiling of the security robots at the mall to a group of important looking people who ask just enough questions to make the plot of the movie as obvious as possible to anyone confused by robots. It seems like these people at the unveiling would be local citizens, or newspaper reporters, but instead they're all doctors and scientists who are identified as being scientists by their stereotype white lab coats and doctors by their beard\/glasses combos and also the guy on stage says you have a question, DOCTOR? to make sure that as you're watching you realize this robot unveiling isn't to be taken lightly and smart people care about it.After this we learn that a group of rowdy teenagers conveniently plan on having a party that night at the furniture store (it has beds&#133; for boning). Who the characters are doesn't really matter. And that's it, they don't matter.As it turns out, the night all of this takes place happens to be the night of one of the most sinisterly accurate lightning storms in the history of all storms. And if you've ever seen a horror movie you know that a lightning strike can do anything from bring Frankenstein's monster to life, to&#133; well bring Jason to life in Friday the 13th. Basically lightning brings various bad guys to life.So the next thing we know various lightning bolts hit some random generator on the mall roof over and over to pound it into the viewer's head that this lightning is going to somehow makes the robots evil, even though the robots aren't in any way hooked up to this generator. Where the robots are is the 3rd floor scientist lab where TWO scientists in white lab coats monitor the robots. So basically this mall is so important they've hired two scientists to work every night to monitor the potentially deadly robots they've unnecessarily bought for mall security. Also one of the scientists is killed while looking at the spread in a playboy mag, so that's comedy gold. The robots and scientists surely must be more expensive to have than anything in the mall that's being protected, but this movie isn't supposed to make sense. It's supposed to accomplish the following1.Find a way to show 80's girl's boobs the teenage party accomplishes this. 2.Trap the kids in the mall with the robots them losing track of time while doing the nassssty gets them locked in and trapped. 3.Find a way to squeeze in a scene where something gets chopped off in order to justify the title This was a failure. 4.Have the robots kill the kids and robots who have to do boring security work but are equipped with lasers and electrocuting tazer darts are bound to find an excuse to kill people.There's no need for a lot of detail, but as was said the teenagers are trapped in the mall for the night and have to find various ways to fight the robots and various ways to be killed by them. Luckily for the kids there's a sporting goods store in the mall that literally has AK 47's on the shelves with boxes of bullets on nearby tables (this was pre-9\/11 so you could get away with those things). As mentioned before, the robots themselves can shoot lasers out of their eyes and they do this with no accuracy whatsoever. Watching the robots chase the kids while trying to shoot them with lasers is like watching an episode of GI Joe where Cobra is firing a ridiculous barrage of laser beams directly at the good guys while managing to not hit a single person. Seriously, did anyone ever get shot in GI Joe besides that one time Flint took one to the heart and had to float around in that tank in his underwear? Actually he didn't even get shot, he got hit by some kind of snake turned into a spear or something. Don't act like you don't know exactly what I'm talking about. Anyway back to the story..Every time the robots kill someone they say thank you. Have a nice day so of course at the end the girl says that to the final robot right before she blows him up.. and it's back to the drawing board for the scientists.At the end of the day this movie really summarizes what the 80's were about Nerds, Boobies, Robots, Scientists, and Malls. In a way it's sort of a documentary of the time. And needless to say, after watching this movie you'll no longer have any desire to go to your lame local mall where the security guards are human and have no desire to kill you.

Not because it's impossible (it's not), but because it makes Hercules look a lot worse than it probably deserves.When it comes to adapting material for children's movies (especially the animated ones), Disney has always been known to change some of the darker aspects of the original story to make it more kid-friendly. Never has it been more apparent than in this film, though considering the source material, it's understandable...to a point. But Disney reworked the whole story, making only passing mentions at the original myth (similar to the fairy tale references to fairy tales in the Shrek movies).Hades (James Woods) is pretty peeved at Zeus (Rip Torn) that he was assigned to govern the underworld. But according to a prophecy, he will have a chance to take over Mount Olympus and rule the world. However, the prophecy also says that there is one person who stands in his way, Zeus' newborn son, Hercules (Josh Keaton\/Roger Bart as Young Hercules). So Hades sends his two monster henchmen, Pain (Bobcat Goldthwait) and Panic (Matt Frewer) to off the kid. The plan almost works, and Hercules ends up living as a mortal, though his god-like strength makes him an outcast. Then Zeus tells him that the only way to become a god again is to become a true hero. So with the help of Phil (Danny DeVito), a hero-trainer, Hercules (played by Tate Donovan as an adult), sets out to become one. Meanwhile, Hades has his own agenda in motion.The problem with Hercules isn't the story, but that it's lazy film-making. It seems as though the filmmakers just wanted to make the quickest movie they could. The drama doesn't work very well, the characters are half-developed, and the energy level is low. There are only a few songs in the film (none of which is especially memorable), unlike in previous Disney features. The animation seems to be inspired by Greek art, but it's not as crisp or beautiful as in other films (and sometimes the merging of hand-drawn and computer animation is inadequately done).Most surprising is the lack of effective humor. Much of the jokes fall flat, and what works is merely amusing. The scenery-chewing sarcasm of Woods' Hades and DeVito's Phil are worth a few grins, but they're not laugh-out-loud hilarious.The other voice talents are uninspired. Tate Donovan is flat as Hercules, and he fails to provide the emotional anchor that the film desperately needs. Susan Egan is a good voice-over actress, and her later work in Miyazaki's Spirited Away proves it. But her talents are not adequately used here, and it makes her less effective (though she still manages to inject some sass into Meg). Rip Torn does what he can with Zeus, but his dialogue is so weak that there isn't much he can do.Hercules is better than Pocahontas, but it's still a far cry from the other Disney features.

I like him, i feel strangely attracted to what he purposes, though i can't help recognizing the highly recognizable flaws.In summary he creates worlds, sometimes he is thrilling on that alone, others not so much. But everyone of his films is a true vision of its creator, and that's something i value a lot. But he is not a good director. Planely as a director, he can't be more than just competent, because he doesn't work on the specific issues of direction (editing, camera-work, actor-direction...) with the same passion and special angle as he does with molding the world he gives us.So look at this. He was still a relatively young director (this was, i believe, his second long form). He didn't craft the world of this film as exquisitely as he did with later works. And the film is a relative failure to me because, once that rich notion of being side a quirky mind is gone, the rest doesn't hold.Oh, one thing that saves it Michael Keaton's performance. I've never seen him act like he did here. He holds this as his best performance ever and i support it. It's a great physical and verbal acting, that engages the audience as well as the characters of the film, so the plot develops around the idea of one trying (and failing) to resist paying attention to him. Great.The animations are tender in some points, it has the flavor of old animations, that look artificial, but which we are willing to believe.

When he reveals to his friends that he has become invisible, the others slowly start to realize that he has also become slightly insane following a series of weird rants and several killings around town. As the police become convinced that he has become invisible and use every part of their imagination and arsenal to trap him, Dr. Cranley, his assistant Kemp, (William Harrigan) and Flora race to find a way to bring his visibility back before the police get to him.The Good News This is one of the greatest horror films of all time. The special effects in the film are absolutely amazing, especially when you take into consideration that they were created nearly seventy years ago. The effects are used liberally, whenever the scene called for it, giving you a sense of just how confident the film-makers were of their ability to maintain the illusion of invisibility. Virtually inventing methods of composite mattes in film made the invisible man truly come alive and real. Some of the scenes showing a shirt running around seemingly by itself, yet obviously containing a man and not being hung by wires, and more difficult ones showing him unwrapping the bandages in a mirror were among the most demanding shots ever done at the time. Even inanimate objects look good. Bicycles ride on their own, lines of footprints appear in the snow, cigarettes are lit and smoke puffed in mid-air. Although there are a few trick that lose their luster today, it is still a remarkable achievement to the technical prowess of the effects. The effects are not only used to build suspense and inspire fear, they are used to create a few comic moments as well. One of the best is when a screaming woman runs down a side road, pursued by an empty pair of pants skipping along while the invisible man sings a catchy tune as he goes is a classic of the genre. Another one occurs when a police inspector states that the invisible man is a figment of the townsfolk's imagination. Upon quipping of the matter, the invisible man tosses an inkwell into the inspector's face. Later moments of hilarity, like a cash drawer carrying itself out of a bank, or the short rampage of pranks in the town, this provides some nice laughs along with the chills. Just as entertaining as any of the impressive visual effects are the interactions of the supporting characters. Their dealings with the surreal situations are not only humorous, but quite believable and do a good job of playing off of the invisible man when he isn't there, even when they have to simulate the effects of physical attacks or react to the sound of his voice. The practical and visual effects are simply superb throughout the film. This is all the more enjoyable for how creative and exciting it is. The police and townspeople also stretch their wits to confront this new condition and come up with an impressive array of solutions. Everything from spray-paint to freshly tarred roads to fishing nets to listening for the sound of sneezes. The film teems with ideas, and these concrete details add credibility to the story and make it enjoyably complex. Coupled with some fantastic pacing and outstanding action scenes, this is a classic in every way it can be thought of.The Bad News There isn't a whole lot at all to dislike. The romance angle between the Invisible Man and his fiancée didn't work at all. There isn't much chemistry, and it's a hard time understanding what she saw in him at all. Even before he became invisible, he apparently ignored her most of the time. This mostly seemed to be coupled into the film so that there would be a female lead rather than an actual reason to be included. The invisible man also seems to have some superhuman abilities.

The Silence of the Lambs was a masterwork because it was fundamentally a character-driven drama that, in part by means of its medium as a police procedural, organically unfolded into gruesome territory. Hannibal is a disclosure of all that was mystique in its predecessor, such as that it is stomach-turning in its barefaced depictions of horrific brutality, comparable to mondo-style exposure of expired anatomy, soaked in blood, guts, brains and screams of inconceivable agony. As a high-tech police procedural as well, one that opens with a bloody shootout between Washington, D.C. police and vicious drug dealers with submachine guns, it is truly a merging of two cinematic worlds. This is what makes Ridley Scott's Hannibal so entertaining as a movie.For example, there is an FBI team of scent specialists. When Clarice obtains a letter from Hannibal conveying sympathy for the disastrous drug bust, the result of which was the shootout, but also jeering her into tracking him down, this sophisticated team finds that he was very prudent not to leave anything on the letter that could impart a trace to his whereabouts, but it is also covered with some distinct brand of perfume which is sold in a very small number of shops all over the world. What a way to merge the unabashed double- tasking brilliance of the title character with such technically evasive criminal bureaucracy.Taking the place of Jodie Foster is Julianne Moore as FBI agent Clarice Starling. We do not miss Foster so much as we miss her portrayal of Clarice as a naïve, eager and guarded cadet, but that is actually a plus for this film. Julianne Moore's Clarice is by now very seasoned, more pessimistic, having been through an overwhelming lot in the ten years since we met her as the ambitious idealist running from childhood memories. Now, she holds the record of having killed more people than any other female FBI agent. The twisted antagonist, Mason Verger, is played with vile drip by an unrecognizable star. Screw it, it's Gary Oldman. We all know now anyway. The key to this element of the story and of the Hannibal character is that any arch enemy of his can only be several times more degenerate. It could never be the other way around.Yet, it is Verger who is bedridden from paralysis in the hospital wing of his mansion. It is he who is nourished intravenously. His surviving eye is watered by a salty drip as a replacement for actual tears. He can move in a motorized wheelchair after being hoisted into it by brawny entourage and his abused doctor Cordell. He is enveloped by specialists and underlings to help him in a variety of fashions, and uses them to hunt down his long-standing adversary.

The Silence of the Lambs was a masterwork because it was fundamentally a character-driven drama that, in part by means of its medium as a police procedural, organically unfolded into gruesome territory. Hannibal is a disclosure of all that was mystique in its predecessor, such as that it is stomach-turning in its barefaced depictions of horrific brutality, comparable to mondo-style exposure of expired anatomy, soaked in blood, guts, brains and screams of inconceivable agony. As a high-tech police procedural as well, one that opens with a bloody shootout between Washington, D.C. police and vicious drug dealers with submachine guns, it is truly a merging of two cinematic worlds. This is what makes Ridley Scott's Hannibal so entertaining as a movie.For example, there is an FBI team of scent specialists. When Clarice obtains a letter from Hannibal conveying sympathy for the disastrous drug bust, the result of which was the shootout, but also jeering her into tracking him down, this sophisticated team finds that he was very prudent not to leave anything on the letter that could impart a trace to his whereabouts, but it is also covered with some distinct brand of perfume which is sold in a very small number of shops all over the world. What a way to merge the unabashed double- tasking brilliance of the title character with such technically evasive criminal bureaucracy.Taking the place of Jodie Foster is Julianne Moore as FBI agent Clarice Starling. We do not miss Foster so much as we miss her portrayal of Clarice as a naïve, eager and guarded cadet, but that is actually a plus for this film. Julianne Moore's Clarice is by now very seasoned, more pessimistic, having been through an overwhelming lot in the ten years since we met her as the ambitious idealist running from childhood memories. Now, she holds the record of having killed more people than any other female FBI agent. The twisted antagonist, Mason Verger, is played with vile drip by an unrecognizable star. Screw it, it's Gary Oldman. We all know now anyway. The key to this element of the story and of the Hannibal character is that any arch enemy of his can only be several times more degenerate. It could never be the other way around.Yet, it is Verger who is bedridden from paralysis in the hospital wing of his mansion. It is he who is nourished intravenously. His surviving eye is watered by a salty drip as a replacement for actual tears. He can move in a motorized wheelchair after being hoisted into it by brawny entourage and his abused doctor Cordell.

His movies create a visual orgasm as the characters walk throughout Mr. Wai's perspective. His conundrums of movies parallel a complete adulation for the very act of love, yet simultaneously exploring the visceral mystique of engaging in such an irrational act. His eccentric characterization only adds to his unparallel story telling ability. This eccentricity is never an overbearing tool throughout his films because his characters are never truly explained or understood. We see them through a lens. As they move in and out of the frame we experience their despair, desire, and destruction. This is achieved not through any conventional dialogue or emotive expressiveness, which can be found in many western romances, but through a rhythm of actions that can be found in his characters. Chungking Express creates two parallel stories that seem to follow the same premises; love is lost but then love is found once more. While these terribly elementary ideas might seem at a glance, too benign to even consider a film for greatness, this film manages to create a world of pure primary emotions that transcend any normal film going experience. The two stories are that of two cops who lose their initial intimate partners but then find solace in a new and unfamiliar face. These characters represent a very male oriented goal of female attainment. At times these two cops who are very much the same, seem almost arrogant in relation to their former partner. In terms of the characters, sexism might be a consideration in the criticism of this film however these stoic eccentric male cops are thrown right along their equally seductive and dominant female foils. One of these female characters plays a blonde bombshell who confidently prowls around the city streets that she seems to own. When she is confronted with the machinations of a group of people who scam her out of a drug deal, she confidently and without hesitation kidnaps a child and assassinates her deceivers, quelling any possibility of insurrection. As one cop tries to gain an advantage on her current state she quickly puts him down. Vulnerability is key to the fabric of these characters. The blonde bombshell, the two cops, the storeowner, and the airline attendant all have their idiosyncrasies that are very much exploited. This exploitation of ones character becomes the very core of a Wong Kar-Wai film. Towards the end of the film these characters find the solace they are so desperately seeking in other strange partners. Music is crucial. The use of music throughout his films is unparallel. His obsession with the pop culture of the Americas is evident throughout much of his work. In Chungking Express we explore this repetition of pop music in the Mama and Papas song, California Dreaming. One character exhibits this song in an almost obsessive manner as she dances around a fast food establishment putting herself on display for the male attendees. This song becomes a pivotal place for these characters and as you listen to it for the twentieth time, its out of place nature becomes as natural to you as it is to watch the characters breathe. Chunking Express in essence becomes a character study on the social outcasts who are meant to hold positions of authority. The dichotomy of these two cops presents us with an interesting perspective on the role of authoritarian figures and poses the question of the sanity of these people. This characterization might not even be crucial to the premises of the filmic structure, but nonetheless it provides us with an interesting introspective into this common cultural value. This film presents us with more than an average romance of two star-crossed lovers who experience their drama through the medium of story. This film transcends that genre and brings us into the realm of imagery. Our eyes follow the characters as they swiftly move through the neon lit landscapes. We explore each of the characters as they entertain each other with anecdotal tales of their past. We sit in awe as the final scene unfolds between the male cop and his lost love.

Not satisfied with their explanation, he decides to stay at the castle to find more information, and tries to use his sister Catherine, (Luana Anders) to get some answers. Learning the truth about her death, he blames him for the torture inflicted upon her and that his story about the castle's torturous past can't be true. The longer he stays at the castle, the more he believes that he has prematurely buried his wife and that he is slowly going insane fearing that she is still alive. When signs emerge that this might be the case, the decision is made to see what the case may be. Discovering the real truth behind the proceedings, they are promptly tortured and are forced to desperate measures to escape.The Good News This here was a pretty pleasant surprise. Despite getting off to a really weak start, this more than makes up for it with a spectacular second half. This all starts when the revelation is made about it being possible she's still alive and the torment undergone. That all starts the film and it only gets better from there. The ploys about it being in the imagination, the evidence against the contrary and then it just breaks out. The moment that the group wanders into the crypt is the start, and the shocking discovery is simply the grand icing on the cake. The dead body used is quite grotesque, looking realistic and freaky at the same time. The other really big scene, the resurrection, is completely eerie and creepy, with the bright spot of not revealing everything about the figure until the end. Only the body is shown, with the face kept in the shadows even during the ensuing chase through the catacombs, which is the bright spot about the scene. Not only is there a brilliant resurrection scene that is spine-chilling, but there's also an elaborate stalking chase right after it, and throughout it all, there's a mystery as well where the complete identity of the figure is kept in the shadows and only a small portion seen throughout. It's a wonderfully brilliant scene. The final ten minutes, where the title comes into play, is simply fantastic, as it's done within a pretty creepy location and actually generates some really suspenseful moments. The closer it comes, the more suspenseful it is, and it really drives the scene. The location used for this scene is actually almost as good, comprising of an elaborate crystal design of weird structures along the outer edges and being a similarly beautiful and creepy place. The castle itself isn't that bad, but the catacombs are it's best locations, with the cobwebbed walls, hidden rooms astutely located, and also features some great places within. The second half here is what really saves this one, and really makes it watchable.The Bad News This doesn't have a whole lot of negatives. One of the most apparent is the slow build-up in the beginning of the film. This starts out incredibly slow, as the beginning is full of nonsensical dialog about what the newcomer is there for. It sets up a nice mystery, but the fact is that there's nothing interesting in the characters wandering around spouting dialog about a character's battle with a disease. It tries to set a mystery about what the motive was, but it's not that interesting and never really means as much as it should do to the incredibly boring introduction. The only other flaw is the really needless dream sequences inserted. The blue light used for the scenes don't offer up much other than confusing at what is actually happening, especially as most of the scene is done through shadow. A blue shadow around everything else doesn't make it any clearer to see what's going on in the screen. This makes no sense, as we know it's a flashback to begin with and really doesn't do much for the film. Otherwise, this here was pretty entertaining.The Final Verdict Once this picks up and enters the final countdown, it's far more entertaining, as the first half is a little tough to sit through.

The location used for this scene is actually almost as good, comprising of an elaborate crystal design of weird structures along the outer edges and being a similarly beautiful and creepy place. The castle itself isn't that bad, but the catacombs are it's best locations, with the cobwebbed walls, hidden rooms astutely located, and also features some great places within. The second half here is what really saves this one, and really makes it watchable.The Bad News This doesn't have a whole lot of negatives. One of the most apparent is the slow build-up in the beginning of the film. This starts out incredibly slow, as the beginning is full of nonsensical dialog about what the newcomer is there for. It sets up a nice mystery, but the fact is that there's nothing interesting in the characters wandering around spouting dialog about a character's battle with a disease. It tries to set a mystery about what the motive was, but it's not that interesting and never really means as much as it should do to the incredibly boring introduction. The only other flaw is the really needless dream sequences inserted. The blue light used for the scenes don't offer up much other than confusing at what is actually happening, especially as most of the scene is done through shadow. A blue shadow around everything else doesn't make it any clearer to see what's going on in the screen. This makes no sense, as we know it's a flashback to begin with and really doesn't do much for the film. Otherwise, this here was pretty entertaining.The Final Verdict Once this picks up and enters the final countdown, it's far more entertaining, as the first half is a little tough to sit through. This is a good pick for fans of Corman\/Poe's work as well as Price fans or of Gothic horror in general.Today's Rating-PG Mild Violence ","genre":"Horror, Mystery"},{"date":"28 October 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" For those of you who are familiar with the story, musical, or other works revolving around Victor Hugo's novel Les Miserables you will not like this movie...

Arriving there, they try to kindle a romance only for a series of strange series attacks by birds. Joined by his mother Lydia Brenner, (Jessica Tandy) and his younger sister Cathy, (Veronica Cartwright) for her birthday party, they get a chance to know each other better. After a couple more, even stranger attacks from the birds, they start to think that the birds are attacking the community. When they finally decide to launch a war against mankind, the remaining town-members fight back to save themselves and understand why they have begin acting like they are.The Good News This was a really good film with a lot to really like about it. The best feature is the idea of unending terror without a given reasoning behind how these birds got this way. This tends to make the understanding of this movie really dependent on viewer, and it works for the better because the audience doesn't really need to know that. Birds are attacking and killing people and, instead of worrying about what is causing it, the characters just need to worry about surviving. That allows for a dramatic increase in the terror, since the survival matters more and can pay out to better effect. This also has an added bonus factor in that the birds that attack the humans aren't birds of prey but rather an assortment of ordinary everyday birds. That's what makes the attacks all the more frightening, as a regular bird seen everyday instills more terror than those that aren't interacting with them on a daily basis. It gives off a realistic vibe that connects, making the randomness of the events that much more horrific. That the big reason for the film's success lies in it's superb attacks aren't all that odd either. Most notable is the entire diner sequence, where a long conversation about the impossibility of the event is broken when they start unleashing their assault. There's the scene inside a phone-booth where the film traps us within the confines of the booth whilst birds ram the glass to try and break in. You can feel the claustrophobia there as there is no escape until the attack subsides, and the ferocity of the birds to break in is explicitly shown in the repeated attempts to get in. It's a long, drawn-out scene with a lot more action than normal for such a scene, as it plays out in spectacular fashion and gets a lot of time to do so. Another attack that really works is the one on the school children. With every new shot of them climbing the frame outside, there are a few more birds waiting until the camera takes you outside to see that it's completely covered in birds. When they decide to take flight, the sheer amount of birds is simply awe-inspiring, and the relentless, remorseless attack is brutal and bloody, making that it's about school-children even more frightening. The pecking and scratching is seen there, and it delivers the shock required. The single best, though, is the final assault in the climax, where their ferociousness is seen first-hand in their unending attempt to get inside. Pecking through doors, crashing through windows, and trying to eat at exposed body parts with determination, it sells them wonderfully, and the second encounter is just simply brutal. This also starts the best possible way, where a single, weird coincidence gradually grows by leaps and bounds by each encounter, with the final one the best one. That's the way it should work, and help make this a spectacular entry.The Bad News This really doesn't have a whole lot, but there is a few problems. The biggest one is the general pacing, which is rather off. The romantic subplot takes up the first fifty minutes before any sort of prolonged attack occurs, leaving the first half really slow-going. That it also contains numerous scenes of talking that leads nowhere also takes up a lot of time. The most obvious ones, where the two girls discuss past dating history, and the girlfriend and mother discuss what happened before they even knew each other are just prime examples. The answers and topics aren't brought up again, and while cementing the relationships, they drag the film out needlessly. At the very least, they could've been trimmed substantially and still kept their overall intent intact. There's also some problems with the special effects, which are, for the most part, pretty bad. The live birds do fine, but are inserted into the scenes so haphazardly that it's so obvious it's a special effect that it takes you out of the scene. There's numerous shots too many to mention where the birds don't come off anywhere near realistically, even if the action itself is spectacular. These hamper the film the most, and are it's main weaknesses.The Final Verdict While it is overrated a tad, this is still a very enjoyable film that has a lot to offer for fans. Most of the nit-picks are easily avoidable and might not even make a dent in viewing, leaving this open to classic horror fans or those looking for a different kind of creature feature altogether.Today's Rating-PG-13 Violence and children-in-danger ","genre":null},{"date":"28 October 2008","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The Birds is slightly overrated but still a really entertaining film.**SPOILERS**Trying to get a rare bird, Melanie Daniels, (Tippi Hedren) is shown up in a prank by Mitchell Brenner, (Rod Taylor) and tracks him to Bodega Bay, a small coastal community.

The special effects are good and cool looking, though back in 1995 they had a bigger impact than they would to someone now. The problem with this movie is it's many corny, clichéd scenes and lines that induce cringing and rolling of the eyes. Other than that, and some weird plot devices, this is a nice family movie, that actually can be enjoyed by the entire family.Carrigan (Cathy Moriarty) cares about nothing but money, and all her deceased father left her was Flagstaff Manor. Supposedly there is a hidden treasure in this mansion. Unfortunately, it's also haunted. Carrigan and her bumbling idiot sidekick Dibbs (Eric Idle) try to get rid of the ghosts through various ways, but in the end they turn to Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman), a psychiatrist to the dead, to help their dilemma. Harvey and his daughter Kat (Christina Ricci) end up meeting the ghosts of the house. Casper is the nice one who just wants a friend, and Casper's horrible uncles Stinky, Stretch and Fatso who only want to scare people. Chaos ensues, Casper and Kat bond, Dr. Harvey tries to help the uncles and learn what has become of his deceased wife, and Carrigan tries to get the houses treasure through any means.The direction here is stellar. This is an atmospheric movie with some lovely shots, and with the material they had to work with (Which isn't bad material) the direction and style was good. The acting depends on the scene. Bill Pullman always acted the same and his character worked well, but Christina Ricci would sometimes overact a bit. Nonetheless, there was nothing unforgivable acting wise. At times, this can be a touching movie. Casper has been developed beyond his former traditionally animated self, and not only continues to have a heart, but has a moving background. You actually feel sad for this computer animated puff of air. Kat also has a sad background, though I didn't find myself caring as much that she lost her mother. A lonely 12 year old ghost who just wants a friend is just a tragic character, but of course, in a family movie this isn't going to be a tragedy.Along with the good, there was bad. Too many scenes featured cringe worthy lines such as Casper's question to Kat, Can I keep you? It was supposed to be sweet, and it was...just a little too sweet. The plot was sidetracked too much by subplots, which would be fine if there was any real coherent plot. From what I can tell, the main plot is that Casper wants to become alive again with the help of his father's invention. The climax is also short and rushed. These are little things though, one's that I didn't notice until after the movie was over.Casper is a sweet movie, that sometimes gives into being too sweet, but mostly it has a great mixture of emotion, comedy and special effects that make this a winner family flick.My rating *** out of ****. 101 mins.

This line has become a part of American dialect to the point where pretty much everyone has a variation of their own. What makes this such a tribute to the movie is that the character, not that he is peripheral by any means, is merely the movie's sideshow-act framework.What is energizing and inspiring about Paddy Chayefsky's script is how slickly it alters its tone. The drama is powerfully written and acted, but it remains up in the clouds with the scenes involving Beale's rants and the Ecumenical Liberation Army, which are gleefully exaggerated. The jargon, pace and personas among the network execs secure a very convincing, documentary realism, but we have no skepticism that the idea that a Howard Beale sort of show would be discussed at the corporate level as the film evokes. And then Chayefsky and director Sidney Lumet creep the realistic network drama over into send-up as well, but with Lumet's subtlety so that in the ultimate meeting where the execs settle on what to do about their quandary, we do not feel cheated into a silly finale because we have subliminally bought into the lunacy. In this sense, I can definitely see why this is Paul Thomas Anderson's favorite movie. All of his films, Boogie Nights and There Will Be Blood in particular, have moments that could so easily be ridiculous, but the cynical tone grants them seamless shift.Seen a quarter century later, Network is like foretelling. And while it seems that I should just be saying that because oh it's such a brilliant movie and it's one of my favorites, it really infuriates me. What Network was raving about via its Peter Finch character and all its edges and points in 1976 caused a great sensation and, as I said, integrated itself into pop culture. Why are the very issues showcased the precise ones that present dire troubles today? Valuable facts or news is today not nearly as important as what makes the viewer panic, or fulfills cheap thrills. We watch and absorb that when Howard Beale, at the end of his rope by the time the film opens, begins to be completely and utterly frank on live television, indicating very alarming points about American society at large, he is a smash hit because his shock value is great for ratings. One of Chayefsky's essential understandings is that the movers and shakers don't really mind what you say on TV, provided that you don't fluctuate their earnings by saying it. Howard Beale demands public fury, he even urges viewers to turn off their TVs, but he only arouses a real reaction when he exposes the network's arrangement to sell their parent company to Arabs. Thirty years later, not a thing has changed.Opposite this extravagance is the affair between Holden and Dunaway. In what is, from what I've seen, her strongest performance, Dunaway is grippingly befitting as the---literally--- obsessed programming executive. See, the film's satire is not so much laugh-out-loud funny as it is a tongue-in-cheek approach to its subject She moistens her lips seductively when she imagines boosted ratings, she goes to bed with Holden while chattering about how economically she can buy slots for James Bond movies. Only about three seconds after the sex begins, she has an orgasm while panting about a concept of hers called The Mao Tse Tung Hour.Just as if not more influential is Holden's performance as a newsman who was trained by Edward R. Murrow, and now sees his beloved news division destroyed by his lover. At the same time, Max is awestruck by her, and purposely has an affair. For him, it is being under the influence with the wrong side of things. I find it funny that Holden has starred in a cynical insider movie about the Hollywood studio system, Sunset Boulevard, and a cynical insider movie about the TV network system, Network.I don't know if I would have given Beatrice Straight an Oscar for her role as his wife. I mean, she basically has one five, ten-minute scene. But, from the moment she appears she has prepared a compelling rendering of a woman who has put up with an insufferable man to whom to be married for so many years that, even if she feels enraged and deluded, she has already been disillusioned to the idea that he could do what he has done. Lumet underscores the meaning of Max's decision to cheat by showing that he and his wife live in an attention- grabbingly refined residence with walls of books and elegant furniture, which goes beyond contrast to Dunaway's cheap place, which we hardly notice, save for maybe a Singin' In the Rain poster briefly. It is clear that she doesn't care where she lives, because she is restless and undemanding of affection or sensitivity. Her home is in a corner office.The film is packed with vivid supporting characters. Not a single person is scenery.

What I loved about this film is that even though it's a wonderful mixture of action, adventure, romance and comedy, it is a simple film. The execution is solid and it shows that Donner and his cast and crew have put a lot of heart in the making of the film.The score is kind of funny. At times there's a beautiful symphony that expresses the beauty of the settings and then, during the action scenes, there's the typical 80's hip track which brings a smile as it nostalgically reminds me of that wild decade. 'Ladyhawke' is indeed very beautiful to look at. The cinematography is superb as it gives a very spacious view and the composition of the shots are very well arranged.No CGI has been used and that marvelously stands out as it gives the film a purer look and only reminds one of the days before CGI was overused, when cinema looked pure and authentic. 'Ladyhawke' is a fine example of movies that can look great and sometimes even better and more effective without CGI (other examples being the Star Wars trilogy (80's version), Indiana Jones etc).The performances are topnotch. A radiant Michelle Pfeiffer completely owns the title role. Her understated performance and quiet yet strong presence (like a hawk) brilliantly contrasts Rutger Hauer's wolfish character. Hauer too does a fine job. An evil Alfred Molino is barely recognizable and Leo McKern wears the menacing look very well. John Wood provides some great comic relief. However, it is Matthew Broderick who stands out. He performs naturally as the vivacious, energetic, deceitful thief who loses his heart to Ladyhawke and at the same time he is determined to reunite the lovers and rescue them from the wrath of the curse.Overall, 'Ladyhawke' is a beautiful movie that satisfied my filmviewing experience. It gives that nostalgic feel, it amuses, it fascinates and it feels enchanting. No wonder it still feels fresh after more than two decades.

The film's greatest strength is it's impressive use of mood and scene to get some chilling moments. The scene where the first body is stolen is told with a nicely shocking economy, as we see an exaggerated shadow creeping along the graveyard wall. Hearing a dog waiting beside its dead master's grave whining, the shadow swings the spade with a clang and the dog's howl suddenly dies. Simple and effective without giving hardly anything away, and with the fog-enshrouded cemetery in the background for the entire sequence merely makes it stand-out more. A later scene where two characters fight each other in front of a roaring fireplace.

The basic technique is to take us out of the world in which we live, but the intent of the author determines. Why.

","genre":"Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"28 October 2008","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" By now, Total Recall is one of those classic action flicks we've seen a million times on TV, but we overlook Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance, judging it as nothing more than action hero presence and not really acting. But Ahnuld is one of the reasons the movie works. He isn't a hulking superman, although he incidentally fights like one. He's a baffled and alarmed guy, deceived by the edifice of reality. And in his susceptibility, he opens the way for this hilarious and ultraviolent Philip K. Dick adaptation to be more than simply a violence and special effects run-around, although the latter half conforms to such.There are loads of action and violence in Total Recall, which frankly would be the perfect movie to watch stoned, and practically every frame appears to inhabit one or more special effects. This is one of the most multifaceted and visually attention-grabbing sci-fi movies even still, in spite of how heavily dated it is now. What would happen to one's mental purity of essence if it were possible to be equipped with memories? If your whole past could be plugged into your brain, taking the place of the experiences through which you had really lived, up till that very moment unashamed for having treasured the things akin to those lacks and wants that caused you to do the things you have done? That's what looks as if to happen to Quaid, the Schwarzenegger character in Total Recall, which should have kept Dick's original title, We Can Remember It For You Wholesale, while periodically neither Quaid nor we can be certain. As he did with RoboCop, Paul Verhoeven creates a desensitized and cynical future, where Quaid lives with his curvy blonde Sharon Stone wife, and works in construction. His life gives a pleasant impression, but he keeps having these violent dreams about Mars that ultimately move him to sign up with a controversial travel agency that endows you with the memory of the perfect vacation as opposed to all the work of achieving a perfect real one.But is this a packaged memory, or a real experience? The movie plays tantalizing mind games with the likelihood, pivotally in a great scene where a doctor and Quaid's Sharon Stone seem to appear out of thin air to convince him of one of the possibilities. Mars is in the middle of a revolutionary war between the forces of a greedy, power-drunk captain of industry, played with great comic book-style verve by Ronny Cox just as he did in Verhoeven's RoboCop, and a group of rebels. There is a mystery involving a huge reactor that was ostensibly assembled by aliens on Mars a million years ago, and has been discovered during mining operations. And can the sexy Rachel Ticotin trust Quaid, who doesn't know that they were lovers some time ago? Total Recall moves from side to side among different translations and planes of reality, whereas all at once filling to the brim with fertile details of a messed up future.I am baffled by the thought that in the future, firearms of all kinds would not be outlawed inside an airtight glass shell like the one in which Earthlings must remain on Mars. There are to be sure quite a lot of moments in which people are sucked outside when the air seal is shattered, but that doesn't stop the movie's villains from never hitting their target, or for that matter the good guys from ever missing theirs.But one can argue that the gaping inconsistencies in this quintessentially 1990s Schwarzenegger picture are on purpose, because the science depicted is laughable all the way through, and right from the start. At many points in the movie, characters wind up outside on Mars, and right away begin to inflate, their eyes popping and their faces ballooning. This is just an example. And from a good deal of what I have seen of Verhoeven's work, such as The Fourth Man, RoboCop and Starship Troopers, he knew how silly this was, and cynically satirized the action adventure tradition's cavalier approach to realism, mortality and violence, which frankly is preferable over an action picture with these approaches that takes itself seriously.
