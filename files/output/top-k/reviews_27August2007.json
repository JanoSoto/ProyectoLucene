[{"date":"27 August 2007","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Wing Commander is based on a popular computer game series from Origin Systems. Unfortunately, this film does not match the quality of the games. The problem is simple the film did not include the elements that made the games successful. Rather than hiring the cast featured in the games led by Mark Hamill and featuring names such as John Rhys-Davies and Malcolm McDowell, the makers of the film opted to hire a completely separate cast. Freddie Prinze Jr. was sub-par in contrast to Mark Hamill's performance as Christopher Blair in the games. The character of Todd Marshall was brash in the game series, but Matthew Lillard's performance makes the character unbearably annoying and obtuse. However, Saffron Burrows actually gives a decent performance and is the best of the three leads. The best talent was in the supporting cast, with Jürgen Prochnow as Commander Gerard, David Suchet as Captain Sansky and David Warner as Admiral Tolwyn. Tchéky Karyo also does a decent job as James Taggart. Seeing the performances of the supporting cast was often more enjoyable than seeing the leads.The plot of the film was extremely simplistic compared to the plots in the game series. The Kilrathi (who look no where near as majestic in the game series) are underdeveloped compared to the game series and no Kilrathi characters are featured in the film. The Kilrathi don't even engage in any sort of intrigue, the extent of their activity is to move toward Earth and attack human ships.The main characters are developed, but most of their interactions seem juvenile. Another poor plot decision was the introduction of the Pilgrim subplot, where the lead character is a Pilgrim, meaning he has special abilities in space navigation. It seems that the makers of the film thought that they needed to add this dimension because it would lead to drama in the film not in the game. Unfortunately, the Pilgrim subplot always seems contrived and the film would have been better simply focusing on what made the game series interesting tactics and intrigues in the war between humans and Kilrathi.Where this film is better is in its action scenes. These are actually well-shot and some nice space combat battles were developed as would be expected from a Wing Commander film. The battles around the Tiger Claw and the Kilrathi pursuit of Blair in his fighter were actually the best parts of the film. Overall, though, this film does not match the game series it purports to emulate.

America , with the help of Freud's nephew that was Hitler's main producer for selling the WW2 to the German people , learned how to sell it's own garbage to the American people and the whole world . Yes , after WW2 , Freud's nephew was employed by The Pentagon for more than 20 years . He is the one that sold the dismantling of Yugoslavia into 6 countries that are still raging social wars just because the U.S.A. was afraid by the fact that Yugoslavia and Romania could be presented as good examples of perfectly functional socialist economies . After working for Hitler , he was taken under the wing of the Pentagon to help them sell everything like Korea , Vietnam , Yugoslavia , Iraq I , etc . In real life , he was The Producer .Don' believe the lies that the TV is selling you ! Do your own research ! This is the TV they want you to believe is impartial  NBC (National Broadcasting Company) is owned by General Electric, ABC (American Broadcasting Company) is owned by Disney, CBS (Columbia Broadcasting System), is owned by Viacom, and CNN (Cable News Network) is owned by AOL (America Online) Time Warner.There is no free press . If you are against them they shut your whole life down . You can't go and say these for real and these facts must be disguised in movies otherwise any actor\/producer\/director might end up like Charlie Sheen .P.S.
