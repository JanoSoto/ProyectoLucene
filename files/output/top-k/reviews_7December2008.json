It's a wonderful way to finish the film on such a large but silent object like the night sky as we pause to catch our breath and take in what has just happened, particularly the events from the final few minutes. Monster's Ball takes us on a journey and we feel as if we have travelled a fair distance by the end of it all with the most impressive thing being that several characters have just about been an even amount of screen time between them all and have been developed to the best of the film's ability.At its heart Monster's Ball is a very simplistic drama but all the more for it. The film does not teeter over that line that makes something wholeheartedly forced and nor does it ever feel fake or melodramatic, constantly keeping in check with what it establishes it will be and maintaining a juxtaposed air of hatred and love in the form of racism and inter-racial relationships. The film works primarily on a dramatic level, I think, because it is a tale of potentially fatale love or a tale of a potentially fatal relationship. The twist on the idea is to do with us, the audience, knowing that one half of the relationship is responsible for the death of the other half's other half. Incidentally, the diegetic knowledge the characters possess to do with potential relationships is entwined with one's race and one character's racist father who has issues with his son seeing a black woman.But the genius is, and I will use the word genius, that the white male half of the relationship doesn't realise he has bigger fish to fry on the horizon when he'll come to realise he was present for the black woman's prior partner's death. It acts as an event on the backburner for the audience to soak up as these two get to know each other in the film's first half exchanges. The characters in question are Hank Grotowski (Thornton) and Leticia Musgrove (Berry), two people who have enough happen to them throughout the course of this narrative to create individual films about them on their own.Hank is a prison guard on death row who resigns after Leticia's prior husband is executed under his watch. Working with him is his own son, Sonny (Ledger), who himself will be a victim of his own guilt and that distinct feeling that you're unloved. Completing the Grotowski family is Buck (Boyle), the wheelchair bound and in need of breathing apparatus racist father who lives on his own in one of those big houses you get in the Southern states of America and only know exist if you're not American and see them via the movies. Leticia, apart from having lost her partner, lives with her overweight son she carries a certain amount of antagonism toward to due to his obesity and eating habits.The dramatic question Hank's son poses to him at one point is along the lines of You hate me, don't you? before adding Well, I always loved you perhaps echoes Leticia's own son's thought process when a similar fate bestows him as to what happens to Sonny. It is these little connections revolving around big events and the people involved in them that force Hank and Leticia to connect in the manner they do. At its core, the film is a character driven drama set on everyday locations and shot in an unspectacular fashion but it really works in atmosphere. The study of Hank and Leticia works through its focus on the everyday and of the chance interactions they go through, be it at the diner she works or especially when she is in her hour of need by the roadside and Hank willingly pulls over.Director Marc Forster shoots his film with bizarre high angles looking down at most things, giving off a sense of God-like perspective as we leech on these people's lives and the tragic events that befall them; it's almost as if we have no right to see what's going on. Prior to an execution scene, Forster keeps the attention concentrated on Leticia and her death row ex-partner by cutting off the police officers at the shoulders and neck maintaining a sensitive aura in the foreground as these two interact for the last time but maintains menace in the background as these authoritarian figures loom ominously and anonymously.Monster's Ball is rewarding for those wanting a touching and drawn out dramatic experience.

It is a very bleak look at the life of four young drug addicts and their lives. Bob (Matt Dillon) is the ringleader. He's experienced, fairly intelligent, and very much addicted. His wife is Dianne (Kelly Lynch). The two of them have been together for years, always stealing and conniving in order to get their fix. Along the way, they've picked up two others (James LeGros and Heather Graham). The film shows us their lives the way they get their drugs, how they have to constantly be on their toes to escape the police who scheme to find ways of arresting the group, and by showing the dangers of the lives they lead.The story is narrated by Bob. At the beginning of the film, we see Bob lying in the back of an ambulance. The film is essentially Bob looking back on his recent past, determining how he got to that point. Bob and Dianne, along with Rick and Nadine, feed their addictions by robbing drugstores and hospitals. They take all the medication they can and proceed to take it, getting high and doped up on everything they can. Nothing seems to be off limits. Things start to turn ugly when Nadine places a 30 day hex on the group. Bob is very superstitious and &#150; at the mention of something as minimal as a dog &#150; believes to his very soul that bad luck is on their side. In this respect, he's right. The police finally dig up some dirt, causing Bob and the gang to pack up and move. They get a hotel room and continue with their lifestyle, robbing another drugstore first, then a hospital. More bad luck ensues, and Bob has some decisions to make.Drugstore Cowboy features and excellent cast. Matt Dillon is a wonderful Bob. Dillon, who has had his share of performances ranging from excellent to dismal, plays this role with conviction. This is a three-dimensional character with his share of problems, but who is also very tormented and easy to feel for. Bob goes through a complete transformation and, with Van Sant's careful execution and Dillon's perfect portrayal, is a very likable, relatable character. Kelly Lynch is less effective, but still rather good in the role of Bob's wife Dianne. Dianne is very torn at the beginning of the film. She's tired of Bob's schemes, the fact that he won't sleep with her, and the way in which he treats people. By the end of the film, though, Dianne seems afraid to change. She's comfortable in her lifestyle, despite the problems she may incur due to it. James LeGros does not have a lot to work with. One emotional scene, though, proves that he knows what he's doing. Rick, his character, is rather under-utilized, but still necessary. Heather Graham plays Nadine, a young and naïve teenager who has latched on to the group as a means of belonging. This is an early role for Graham, but is arguably one of her best performances. She makes Nadine a very pitiful, sad character with whom the audience can most easily feel sorry for.Gus Van Sant has obvious talent as a director and this film is the perfect representation of that. Each character is dealt with very carefully and each actor is on key. This is easily due to Van Sant's talent as a director. Drugstore Cowboy essentially shows the degradation of young lives as a result of drug abuse. It does not glorify the lifestyle in the least, but it is also not preachy. In the hands of another director, Drugstore Cowboy may have ended up a completely different type of movie. Films like Requiem for a Dream, which tried to accomplish the same thing, are overly done and can feel more like an after school special than a realistic look into the lives of these people. Drugstore Cowboy does this perfectly and it is under Van Sant's execution that it works the way it does.Bleak and uncompromising, Drugstore Cowboy is a very impressive film from Van Sant. It features wonderful performances from its four young actors and offers a rather realistic look into the way drug addicts live their lives. It remains intriguing throughout its entire runtime and does not look down at its audience. It contains all the elements an effective film needs to be great a talented director, an able cast, an interesting premise, and a glorious execution.

It is a very bleak look at the life of four young drug addicts and their lives. Bob (Matt Dillon) is the ringleader. He's experienced, fairly intelligent, and very much addicted. His wife is Dianne (Kelly Lynch). The two of them have been together for years, always stealing and conniving in order to get their fix. Along the way, they've picked up two others (James LeGros and Heather Graham). The film shows us their lives the way they get their drugs, how they have to constantly be on their toes to escape the police who scheme to find ways of arresting the group, and by showing the dangers of the lives they lead.The story is narrated by Bob. At the beginning of the film, we see Bob lying in the back of an ambulance. The film is essentially Bob looking back on his recent past, determining how he got to that point. Bob and Dianne, along with Rick and Nadine, feed their addictions by robbing drugstores and hospitals. They take all the medication they can and proceed to take it, getting high and doped up on everything they can. Nothing seems to be off limits. Things start to turn ugly when Nadine places a 30 day hex on the group. Bob is very superstitious and &#150; at the mention of something as minimal as a dog &#150; believes to his very soul that bad luck is on their side. In this respect, he's right. The police finally dig up some dirt, causing Bob and the gang to pack up and move. They get a hotel room and continue with their lifestyle, robbing another drugstore first, then a hospital. More bad luck ensues, and Bob has some decisions to make.Drugstore Cowboy features and excellent cast. Matt Dillon is a wonderful Bob. Dillon, who has had his share of performances ranging from excellent to dismal, plays this role with conviction. This is a three-dimensional character with his share of problems, but who is also very tormented and easy to feel for. Bob goes through a complete transformation and, with Van Sant's careful execution and Dillon's perfect portrayal, is a very likable, relatable character. Kelly Lynch is less effective, but still rather good in the role of Bob's wife Dianne. Dianne is very torn at the beginning of the film. She's tired of Bob's schemes, the fact that he won't sleep with her, and the way in which he treats people. By the end of the film, though, Dianne seems afraid to change. She's comfortable in her lifestyle, despite the problems she may incur due to it. James LeGros does not have a lot to work with. One emotional scene, though, proves that he knows what he's doing. Rick, his character, is rather under-utilized, but still necessary. Heather Graham plays Nadine, a young and naïve teenager who has latched on to the group as a means of belonging. This is an early role for Graham, but is arguably one of her best performances. She makes Nadine a very pitiful, sad character with whom the audience can most easily feel sorry for.Gus Van Sant has obvious talent as a director and this film is the perfect representation of that. Each character is dealt with very carefully and each actor is on key. This is easily due to Van Sant's talent as a director. Drugstore Cowboy essentially shows the degradation of young lives as a result of drug abuse. It does not glorify the lifestyle in the least, but it is also not preachy. In the hands of another director, Drugstore Cowboy may have ended up a completely different type of movie. Films like Requiem for a Dream, which tried to accomplish the same thing, are overly done and can feel more like an after school special than a realistic look into the lives of these people. Drugstore Cowboy does this perfectly and it is under Van Sant's execution that it works the way it does.Bleak and uncompromising, Drugstore Cowboy is a very impressive film from Van Sant. It features wonderful performances from its four young actors and offers a rather realistic look into the way drug addicts live their lives. It remains intriguing throughout its entire runtime and does not look down at its audience. It contains all the elements an effective film needs to be great a talented director, an able cast, an interesting premise, and a glorious execution. Drugstore Cowboy is not to be missed.9\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"7 December 2008","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" It was 6\/10\/1999. I was so worried about a result of some exam, and wanting desperately to end the time with anything. My friend (great fan of Jean-Claude Van Damme) told me while we were walking near the cinema Let's go to Van Damme's new movie, I vetoed for many reasons, first of all I'm not that fan of Van Damme, I rather watch him in a rented video, and it was part 2 of a movie I didn't watch. While I was explicating these points, my friend has bought the tickets already ! Although he had a very bad experience out of watching Van Damme's last movie (Knock Off), one year before, saying anguished at the time in a memorably serious way (This Is Not a Movie !), but my friend was having the gift of the fast forgetting.We sat in the first row of seats (I've decided never to repeat that again in my life !). Strange notice  we were all men in the theater ! Something I've witnessed shortly after again in 2\/2000 at James Bond's movie (The World is Not Enough), the dames don't prefer to watch the guys' flicks in the movies ?? Well, I also didn't watch a chick flick in the movies ever! I recall trailers first for movies like (The 13th Warrior), (The Matrix), yet the one which made us so enthusiastic was (Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace)'s one (WAW, how we were wrong !). When the movie began, I was optimistic especially after some good chase in the sea, yet after that.. I have to say, it was hilarious; cutting the head like a slice of pizza, the huge computer (who's the idiot that designed its image ?!, it's awfully childish), and of course when I discovered the fact of it as a long wrestling match in the form of a movie. So you can imagine my feeling during the third act where all the fights were absurdly unstoppable.I remember also how all the male audience demurred at the kissing part since it came while the hero was about to face his many opponents, to hear some things like (Come' on, you have no time, it's not appropriate right now, move it MAN !). While the feast of the martial arts at the end I was having the best time, laughing wildly to forget what I paid for watching what turned out to be a determinedly low B-movie, to forget about what my friend had promised me (Van Damme would have a sexy girl and perform a long bed scene with her!), or to forget about the main reason I went to it in the first place (the damn exam's result). I loved only the character of undying enemy named Romeo (he summarized gleefully and ironically the cartoonish case of today's undefeatable foes in movies !), some convincing performance from Van Damme's side (with a white hair this time like he became wiser), and the beautiful heroine (my friend said that I have a thing for the unruly recalcitrant girls!). Although as a whole (Universal Solder 2) wasn't important, but it was harmless too. It was just the most straight-to-video movie I've ever seen in a theater.Afterwards, we've watched in some TV channel the music video of the movie which contains a rock song from its soundtrack, and let me tell you that was way, and I mean way, better than the movie itself. It's disappointing how the publicity's guys made a finer job than what the actual movie's makers did. I was reading in Empire at the time about Van Damme's problems (drinking, divorcing, going in or out the jail&#x85; ). Anyway neither me or my friend watched a Van Damme's movie in a theater again, simply because there weren't ones for him there anymore, as all of his works at the 2000s became straight to video, just like (Wesley Snipes) and (Steven Seagal), in the same time that (Schwarzenegger) was making bad movies to become finally a governor, and with the absence of (Mel Gibson) as an action star, it was nearly the end of the 1990s' era for us. I even didn't meet my friend himself since 2001 !! So the poster's tagline prepare to be obsolete was a real jinx or kind of prophecy.Not to mention how the names that supplanted weren't as interesting as the previous such as (The Rock), (Jason Statham), (Jet Li). Moreover can you believe or stand (Ben Affleck), (Keanu Reeves), or (Tom Cruise) in action ?!! There're like the boys replacing the men !. After years, the movie was on TV, I said to myself, now that's a good chance to watch it rightly, to sleep after the first 15 minutes.

Near Dark kicks all kinds of ass as a horror movie, and is also quite heartbreaking in a lot of instances. The romance between the two leads works, the villains of the story (mainly Lance Henrikson and Bill Paxton, both going between dead-serious and camp like jumping rope) are frightening and sadistic and with that touch of crazy that makes them indelible, and the violence is gruesome and raw and full of intensity for what Bigelow is after. A sleeper.The short of it is that a good ol' boy in Texas (Pasdar) meets a girl (Wright) one night in town, the two hit it off very well - so much so that they make out and the girl bites the cowboy on the neck - until he turns into a vampire pretty soon after. It's an infection as we hear, which is conveniently left out (though with good reason since Bigelow doesn't want the obvious cutting into the semi-realism), as the cowboy Caleb is picked up by the girl and her possee of other vampire degenerates who cruise around, hitchhiking, going to bars, eating and sucking the blood out of whatever's on the menu. All of the dialog surrounding the characters is never forced or pumped up too much for exploitation; when Pasdar runs into his father and little sister again- and the father manages to take him back home to get a certain blood transfusion done- it's handled carefully, without hefty cheese or pretension.While one may want to argue about if the blood transfusion bit makes sense with the vampire myths, it can also be argued whether or not these are exactly by definition vampires. I would undoubtedly argue that they are, but that also Bigelow is tooling around with the genre to make it fit, in part, as a bloody good western. If it were set specifically as a real western, Caleb's turning into a monster would just be as a kind or prisoner, maybe as a forced gunslinger or other. As it is here, the vampire angle is a modus operandi for Near Dark's scary and chilling take on rural outsiders who are doomed to their way of life hunting by dark, staying out of the sun at day. But, thankfully as well, Bigelow pulls out some really amazing, show-stopping scenes to mark it as something of an under-looked classic, like with the deliberately paced scene at the bar (can a bartender mess up loading his gun more?) or Paxton's last stand against the truck.Actually, if for nothing else, a genre fan should watch the one-year-after-Aliens re-teaming of Bill Paxton and Lance Henrikson, both playing variations on scum who act mean and lean and cruel and laughing maniacally all the way while burning to a crisp. One is reminded how good an asset one or the other could be - and then together make a really awesome package for fans. Near Dark is what it looks to be from the cover, what it lives up to be exceeding expectations on the modern vampire movie, with limited camp and honesty to its treatment of vampirism as a blasted infection as opposed to a curse.

Despite lacking a really big name in the cast, (it is just possible to envisage a McQueen or Newman in Walter Matthau's role), this only adds to the everyday mundanity of the scenario presented and enhances the credibility of the situation. It really does look and play like a real-life event, aided in this also by the near-real-time sequence of events depicted. The dialogue is razor-sharp, very much in the local vernacular with much grim humour abounding, the mixture of studio and actual locations wholly convincing and the ensemble acting first-rate. Robert Shaw is very good as the cold calculating mastermind, while Walter Matthau, for whom the phrase hangdog expression must have been invented, gets a break from his numerous comedy castings and is even better as the workaday transport cop whose instincts carry the day, even surrounded by dozens of real cops. The narrative is played out tautly, with the tension kept right up, but as stated, isn't afraid to throw in some humour to season the offering here. Thus we get a humorous sub-plot with Lee Wallace as a flu-ridden mayor, unpopular with his electorate, happy to lie in bed watching daytime TV, until goaded into action by a very good Tony Roberts as his deputy. The violence is sparing but effective, the out-of-control train at the end again pre-dates Speed by several years, with the concluding denouement handled superbly and even if I saw well in advance Martin Balsam's give-away to Matthau in the last scene, it couldn't have been delivered more crisply or succinctly. Certainly no need for alternative endings here. All in all, I just thought it was a gripping, exhilarating ride of a movie, unfairly overlooked and worthy of plaudits which somehow seemed to pass it by on original release.

It is immediately apparent that contact with the monkey has dark consequences after the local tribe attempt to stop its export at all costs and one of the captors is butchered by his own men after only the tiniest bite. Back in Newtown, star crossed lovers Lionel Cosgrove (Timothy Balme) and Paquita Maria Sanchez (Diana Peñalver) set out on a secret date to the a fore mentioned zoo. However Lionel's controlling mother Vera (Liz Moody) is there to spy on them. As she creeps through the bushes she gets a little too close to the rat-monkey's cage and suffers a severe bite. Lionel rushes his mother home, but despite his best efforts (fuelled by his inner guilt about causing his father's death as a boy) the damage is already done. Paquita warns Lionel that 'Dark forces are amassing against him', she's not wrong.I feel it is worth pointing out at this point that this film is officially the goriest film ever as it used a record amount of stage blood. So if you are looking for gore Braindead cannot be beaten, there was 700 litres used in the last scene alone (the one with the lawnmower, i won't go into detail because it really must be seen). Note that the Zombies in Braindead are not 'killed' by the tried and tested method of destroying the brain or removing the head. These Zombies will attack until they are blended to nothing. For example our hero Lionel is attacked at various points by a single hand, the top part of a severed head and even the guts of a dismembered body. If u can still see it, its coming for you.Braindead is a horror\/comedy which means the plot is not particularly developed, there is no real explanation of why or how the bites lead to people turning to zombies and whilst there is brief mention of a curse, this is not enforced. There is an interesting back story regarding Lionel but the other characters are largely based on stereotypes which means there is not a huge amount of personality development. Having said that the film is fairly unique in its use of zombie characterisation, in most horror films the transition of person to zombie involves the loss of anything that made the character human. However in Braindead the main zombies retain their previous traits but they are distorted to reflect their worst, this adds a villainous dimension that zombie films tend to lack.Being a comedy this film does lack any particularly frightening moments, this isn't helped by the fact that the visual effects, although entertaining, now seem dated. I felt more moments where I was impressed with the the effects rather than startled or scared by them. However the comedy and gruesome elements more than make up for the lack of frights. The comedy is very twisted and undeniably hilarious, it would probably not appeal to a mainstream audience but I would definitely suggest that it would appeal to most zombie film fans, who would likely enjoy Lionel restraining a zombie by digging a rake into its head and clamping the other end into a vice.

And pay attention to the things Houdini says like Never try to fool children. They expect nothing and therefore see everything, because his character exists to articulate the film's themes. These revolve around the need for many people to believe in the existence of spiritual concepts, the wisdom of not challenging these beliefs if they give sustenance, and how loss of the ability to see much that is hidden goes along with our loss of innocence. The innocence is stressed early in the film when an 8 year-old girl fearlessly seeks out a horribly scarred veteran on the train and gets her corporal's help to play a game of cat's cradle. In its best montage the film moves between, Houdini's fabled The Chinese Water Torture Cell illusion, a chess match, and the first-hand spiritual education of an investigative reporter. The film loosely documents the Cottingley fairies incident in 1917 when two English girls produced photographs that showed themselves in the presence of fairies. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (insert Sherlock Holmes here) published the photographs when he and various experts became convinced they were authentic. Many years later the girls would confess that they had faked all but one of the photos, but they continued to claim that their fairies actually exist. 12-year-old Elsie Wright (Florence Hoath) and 8-year-old Frances Griffiths (Elizabeth Earl) are the girls. It is late in WW1 and Francis has come to live with her Aunt and Uncle because her father is missing in action on the front lines. The Wright's too are dealing with a recent loss as Elsie's brother has passed away. So both children and Mrs. Wright (Phoebe Nicholls) are primed for belief in the other world. Yes there are fairies, the viewer sees them when no people are around and we see them leaving the area when Doyle's revelations cause the property to be trampled by a hoard of both believers and skeptics. The production design and the special effects are impressive and the film is absorbing from scene to scene. The target audience is a little hard to pin down as the subject is geared to children but much of the story a bit confusing if you are not already familiar with historical figures like Houdini and Doyle. The film utilizes the tried and true device for connecting with children by giving them a story about young people who know stuff is real, even though adults don't get it. In the film the age gap between the two girls is slightly less than it was in real life, which gives their relationship a bit more believability. Even more impressive is how successful the director was in the subtle creation two very distinct personalities. Elsie is shy and artistic. Frances is confident and social. Their interplay is the film's real strength; apparently the director sensed this dynamic and worked very hard in his acting for the camera direction of the two young actresses. He kept them in character and added behavioral elements they give their characters considerable depth and dimensionality. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

SERIOUSLY! I originally gave this film a very low score but have reconsidered it after having read the Anthony Burgess novel and then seen the movie again. The Burgess novel is brilliant but necessarily violent given the subject matter. I still think that Stanley Kubrick really lost his way in this film because he increased the level of violence and especially nudity--making the film, at time, almost like a sex film. This was just gratuitous and seemed highly reminiscent of NATURAL BORN KILLERS--a film that was just too graphic and needlessly trivialized violence. However, despite Kubrick's overindulgence, the film is pretty good and reasonably close to the novel--and I appreciated this greatly. Plus, I liked Malcolm McDowell's nice performance.First, let's talk about the overindulgence that keep me from seeing this as a brilliant film (despite popular opinion--after all, it's #49 on the IMDb top 250). The book never had such graphic rape scenes and that much sex. In Kubrick's vision, the story is more about sex than violence much of the time--completely missing the point of Burgess' novel. Adding rapes and making many of the scenes so very graphic just seemed unnecessary and make this an adults-only film that easily earned the X rating (today it clearly would be an NC-17 film). Plus, Kubrick's need for over-indulgence made the film seem more like a Ken Russell film--just unnecessarily crude with statues of Jesus with an erect penis, the character Alex beating to death a woman with a giant penis and testicles statue (the original way she dies in the book was much better--funny and ironic) and many, many scenes of graphic non-violent nudity that were not even in the book. Oddly, despite the many depravities, Kubrick chose not to include an attempt by one of Alex's roommates to sexually abuse him--an odd omission considering everything else.Now if you can manage to watch the film and ignore how over the top it is compared to the book, you will be happy that most of the scenes in the book are still there (though, as I think, with a few unnecessary additions). Plus, much of the spirit of Burgess' excellent novel is present--along with Alex's clever narration. On the very positive side, the movie is based on the American version of the novel not the original British one (which is odd, as Kubrick loved the UK and didn't think much of his home country according to most reports). In the British version, there was a final unnecessary chapter in which, by Alex was in his early 20s and he was essentially cured--wanting to become a productive citizen practically overnight. While a redemption is possible, having it happen so young and so quickly with such a hard-core sociopath didn't make any sense at all and undid most of the book. Leaving Alex an unrepentant and vile individual had much greater impact.By the way, it's never really said but I thought it was implied in both the book and film that after Alex's attempted suicide, doctors de-programmed him--possibly by employing psychosurgery or more conditioning techniques. I spoke to a friend who never noticed this--yet he LOVED the book. What did you think about Alex's transformation following this attempt? Overall, a very good version of the Burgess book but also way too sexually explicit--limiting the movie's audience and possibly encouraging rape and violence instead of being a tale about totalitarianism and behavioral conditioning.

The key to the film is understanding that Meryl Streep's character comes from a non-imperialist country, or at least one that had no imperial ambitions at the time she came to Africa. Denmark in 1914 owned Iceland, Greenland, and the Virgin Islands and the last she'd sell to the USA a few years later. The assumptions of racial superiority just aren't in her as they are with some people, including her husband Klaus Maria Brandauer who's been there awhile. She's an odd duck in the Kenya colony, but she gradually wins their respect.Bored with her life in Denmark among the upper crust of that country, Meryl enters into a marriage with Klaus Maria Brandauer, the brother of a friend and goes to East Africa where with her money he hopes to start a cattle ranch. Without telling her he decides to grow coffee instead and that marks a first breach in the relationship.It's a fine day when she wakes up and is diagnosed with a venereal disease which was untreatable not so very long ago. It's grounds for her to leave for Denmark and take the cure. She also separates from her husband though they stay cordial.

For instance it delayed till the end of its first half to hit its point of attack (the idea of the heist) to have us for quite some time watching just the problem which led to that !. Plus, what's the need for an extra girl (the daughter of the weapons' dealer) where she did nothing to the story or the comedy ??, or what's the need for free nasty scenes like the big black worker woman at the prison who looks lustfully to the young girls' short skirts ??!! Actually I suspect also how the 2 minutes of where are they now? part was added just to lengthen the movie's running time which's originally a 73 minutes long only. Let alone how its third act (the robbery itself) wasn't as hot and ironic as it should have been. However, it's fresh comedy, with smart conflict where the unexpected always happens. The cast was totally cute and comic with great sense of humor to mock scornfully at the teen girls. The hidden satire gives it a little deepness that could make it live longer; you must rob to survive, the perfect role models aren't that perfect after all, and it even shows how the dirty money financed the politicians, or how the politicians themselves can be so dull (to have a gang's head as a wife, and know nothing about it !). It's a good little crime comedy that assured how the unfair society must be robbed, and how the teen polished girls can plan and achieve the perfect crime.

There's even plans for yet another version in 2009. This Disney version holds up very well even with the sometimes annoying presence of Kevin Corcoran as the youngest son.The original novel had four sons and they weren't named Robinson as that is most definitely not a German name. As written in 1812 the only connection to Robinson was reference to another fictional hero who survived many years on a desert island, most of that alone, Robinson Crusoe. One thing I've got to say is that these people with what they could salvage off the ship when they were wrecked were living pretty good, not hardly as primitive as can be. Yet parents John Mills and Dorothy McGuire who are actually kind of liking their little paradise are concerned about inevitable problems for boys without female companionship. As delicately as Walt Disney could put it about the facts of life.Later on the two older boys James MacArthur and Tommy Kirk have occasion to rescue Janet Munro who is in drag as a boy from those same Malay pirates who who waylaid the Robinson ship in the first place. When they discover she's a girl those complications start rearing their ugly head.When the final battle comes with the Malay pirates led by Sessue Hayakawa, it starts off as an A-Team like fight, but later turns into quite a battle for the lives of the family. If I were John Mills I might have given Kevin Corcoran to the pirates. This kid who's been one royal pain in the butt from the start, actually whistles to get their dogs inside the compound when the pirates land and as they're going in the opposite direction attracts them to where the family is, setting off the events of the climax. But a lot of people back in the day thought young Moochie was cute.Other than Kevin Corcoran, the movie holds up very well, it's still a fun family film for families other than the Robinsons.

At work, his boss is using the current account he's working on as a daily Sword of Damocles, as girlfriend Robin (Leslie Mann) reacts to his marriage proposal by kicking him out (a true romance killer). Buddy Rick (Jack Black) suggests that, as part of moving in to his own place, he slips whatever cable guy shows up an extra $50 to snag the premium channels for free. Steven repeats this to the Cable Guy (Jim Carrey) that DOES show up to install his cable.Big mistake.Oh, yeah, all this takes place against the backdrop of the trial of angry, disgruntled former child star Sam Sweet (director Ben Stiller), an event being celebrated as if it were the Super Bowl.I'd like to get the contemporaries of the film out of the way first. It's the kind of casting that only Stiller could concoct, which is one of the trademarks of his films. You can see performances of members of Stiller's own inner circle--Janeane Garofalo, Andy Dick, and even charter member Owen Wilson, as well as Black and his Tenacious D cohort, Kyle Gass, Kathy Griffin, Sean Whalen, Mr. Show masterminds David Cross and Bob Odenkirk, and a truly priceless cameo by Eric Roberts, easily one of Hollywood's greatest sports. Set pieces and scenes are mini-stories in themselves, played for laughs, as you might expect. The atmosphere is classic Greek tragedy by the way of Saturday Night Live and Madison Avenue, with just the slightest dash of Mark Twain. (I'd offer a ransom to hear what Mark Twain might say about television.) Which brings me to the point--a lot of what I hear about this film courts terms such as underrated and overlooked. I have a theory about why that is. First, know that at its heart, The Cable Guy is satire, a second-home genre to Stiller. Satire normally doesn't do very well at the box office, because it is usually an honest attempt to hold a high-definition mirror up to society. This perpetuates truth, something, according to history, humans hate. The worst effects of television on society are on display in this film, and they're funny because they're truth. It's extremely fair to say that it's not a comedy--possibly more accurate to say that it's not JUST a comedy. It's easy to dismiss a film like this while we gallop right back into the arms of Will & Grace, Ultimate Fighting Championship, Survivor, The O.C., TMZ, or the ruling distraction of the moment. The darkness, whether in Carrey's performance, or the resulting interplay (say what you will of Broderick, but doing the straight man ain't no piece of cake), is validated by everything else. Again, it's funny BECAUSE it's true. Take for granted that if you have even a little TV in your home, you have a little Chip Douglas in you. Yes, even you.
