Visually the film has some amazing moments and David Twohy can be extremely proud of what he has put together.  Special praise has to go to the David Eggby and also lighting department, for the excellent cinematography and lighting.  The editing is good, but their are no really scary moments which would make someone jump out of their seats.  The computer stuff is done extremely well and is never aloud to overwhelm the film or over shadow the actors.  The fight sequences are well put together and extremely exciting, especially when Riddick goes one on one, with one of the creatures, maybe the highlight of the movie.  Praise, also has to go to Graeme Revell for putting an amazing score to the film, which I now cannot get out of my head.Overall, this is the movie that Alien 3 and 4 should have been, its exciting, thrilling and also stunning to watch.

Also if you are willing to waste 2 and half hours of your life to see what special FX can do these days, go for it. If you're looking for something more, don't even think twice.

But that is not the case. I realize why Jaws 2 was made, and that is as an excuse to make money. It is only natural to feed the public a sequel, and feed more bathers to a great white. As a movie, it is good, although not even close to the same league as the original. Jaws 2 is more of a teen slasher pic than a carefully crafted thriller like the first movie was.The biggest drawback is the fact that Roy Scheider has to carry the acting workload, without Robert Shaw or Richard Dreyfuss to play off of. Scheider does an admirable job as the stressed out police chief Martin Brody, once again trying to convince the town fathers there is a shark on the loose. But after awhile, a lot of it just boils down to him running around like a madman yelling Shark!. Murray Hamilton as Mayor Vaughn is sympathetic to Brody this time, but the opposition now comes from Joseph Mascollo as a real estate salesman and Mrs. Brody's boss. The interaction between him and Brody is nowhere close to the byplay between the chief and Mayor Vaughn in the first movie. It's just a plot device to allow people to be attacked. Of course, it's the kids that take the beating, as the shark mauls everything in sight. As far as the shark, well, Bruce (The name for the shark dubbed by SS himself during the first film) gets pretty much exposed in this one. At one point, he looks like he breaks his upper jaw and nose straining to take a bite out of a kid, making him look like a foam rubber puppet. By the end, he gets too much screen time to be scary anymore. Where as the first Jaws had a lot of things that a 25 foot shark would actually do, this one just stretches the bounds to make the shark seem more evil than the original. By the way, at several points in the film they toy with the idea that this shark wants revenge for the death of the first great white. This, of course is a prelude to Jaws The Revenge, a movie I DO hate and refuse to consider part of the Jaws legacy.Jaws 2 is not a bad film, but it can't help but pale in comparison to the first.

Whitaker is Ghost Dog, a New York hitman who lives by the code of the ancient samurai. When a job for the mob goes wrong they decide to cut their losses and put a hit out on him. But since he's a samurai and not just a normal hitman this proves to be a huge mistake for them. This film really works on three levels. First is the duality of the film's coolness factor and the strength of Whitaker's performance. Whitaker radiates cool in this film. In every scene and every frame, through both action and inaction we know he is being of awesome power. His performance is note perfect. There's one scene where a grievous wrong has been done and we see Whitaker absorb the devastation, then he narrates that when a making decision it should be done in the space of seven breathes. Once that decision is made and we realize Whitaker's full fury will now be unleashed upon his enemies, it sends a tingle up the spine of the viewer. Whitaker's resolve shines through the screen and through his subsequent acting the pace builds until we reach the film's ultimate battle, which is a really, really good fight scene-one of the most satisfying ever filmed.Furthermore we have the film's philosophy. This aspect of the film is the most important of all even more so than Whitaker's superb performance. As the film's tale unfolds we do need learn about the Way of the Samurai through the eastern philosophy Whitaker espouses as he narrates the film. Often times the film breaks from the action just to linger on the narration and let in sink in. It's a technique that helps set the tone of the film and makes it a completely absorbing experience. The third thing that the film does really well is it is character and not plot driven. At least just as much time is spent following Whitaker through his day to day life as he interacts with people in his community as is spent on the action parts of the plot. In many ways the film works as commentary on the values of modern society. The scenes with Whitaker and his best friend, a Haitian ice cream vendor provide this film with true heart and soul. We see repeatedly that the two friends can understand each other because they are at peace with the world and in tune with their surroundings, so that their bond transcends mere language. Ghost Dog also has a touching relationship with a young girl that he hopes to impart his code to so that she may one day have the tools of knowledge necessary to escape life in the inner city. These are characters that would have been interesting a two-hour film just living their lives without the samurai and hitman aspects of the film. However both aspects work exceptionally well, the effect taken as a whole make this one of the best films of the past few years.Besides Whitaker and his friends, one other great performance is given by Tricia Vessey as Louise Vargo, the young girl that sets all that happens in motion. It's a small part but a key one that she does an admirable job with.If there is a flaw with this film it is that the gangster villains are unnecessarily racist. These scenes are somewhat jarring on first viewing, but are at least consistent with the film's ultimate tone that the gangster's way of life is dying, while the code of the samurai is timeless. It is no coincidence that all the mobsters are much older than Whitaker. Both characters note numerous times that the world is changing, the difference is the gangsters say it with fear and trepidation, while Whitaker notices it as observation. Like the changing of the wind the changing of time and circumstance is neither good nor bad when weighed against his code.While Whitaker deserves infinite praise for his performance, almost just as much praise must be given to director Jim Jarmush. His directing of this film is quite daring and even more skillfull. His approach to the narration is unusual and yet it works on multiple levels and lets us this is a film more about tone than action. The character driven film is a rare commodity. Most films are plot driven moving from point A to point B with no more creativity than a child connecting a dot-to-dot. Here we have a film that starts with its characters and lets them live the lives they've always lived before the central plot elements invaded their existence. The plot is addressed in a timely enough manner, but we see the characters have their own commitments to fulfill too. It's a hard trick to make a character driven film really work without seeming disjointed or slowly paced but Jarmush succeeds masterfully. Jarmush also fills the film with other references in the background that emphasize the character's natures-such as book on bears or the dialogue of a few cartoons here and there. Many films of try to do this, but few films I have ever seen do it as well as Ghost Dog does.A final note, the ending of this film that is one that will be very divisive. People will either love it or hate, personally I loved it. It is an ending that is true to all that his come before for both the characters and their conflicting codes but also one that is both surprising despite being adequately foreshadowed.

Most films are plot driven moving from point A to point B with no more creativity than a child connecting a dot-to-dot. Here we have a film that starts with its characters and lets them live the lives they've always lived before the central plot elements invaded their existence. The plot is addressed in a timely enough manner, but we see the characters have their own commitments to fulfill too. It's a hard trick to make a character driven film really work without seeming disjointed or slowly paced but Jarmush succeeds masterfully. Jarmush also fills the film with other references in the background that emphasize the character's natures-such as book on bears or the dialogue of a few cartoons here and there. Many films of try to do this, but few films I have ever seen do it as well as Ghost Dog does.A final note, the ending of this film that is one that will be very divisive. People will either love it or hate, personally I loved it. It is an ending that is true to all that his come before for both the characters and their conflicting codes but also one that is both surprising despite being adequately foreshadowed.

I read some of the negative user reviews of this movie, and I must say those reviewers obviously don't know how to follow and appreciate a good story. That became more obvious when I read some of their other reviews. This is a story of two young men who knew nothing but 1940s Texas ranch life, and head out to Mexico for an adventure, to work as cowboys for a while. What they encounter is totally unpredictable, as well as how they handle their situations. Well-acted and beautifully filmed, this really is a fine movie. When appropriate, the actors pause, reflect, figure out what to do, as we would in real life. No rapid fire dialog here!I saw the DVD version at home. The film opens with great horses sounds all around you, making full use of the 5.1 channels of DD surround. As you would expect, the picture is flawless. However, I was disappointed in the very spartan extras on the DVD.CAUTION -- A SPOILER OR TWO FOLLOW --John (Matt Damon) is the main character. His grandfather had just died, his mother, aspiring stage actress, is the only heir to the ranch near San Angelo, Texas, and decides to sell it to an oil company who will pay 3 times what it is worth. So, without a family and a ranch, John decides to take off for Mexico, about 150 miles south. His best friend, Lacey (Henry Thomas of E.T. fame) goes with him. They cross the Rio Grande, and down the road meet up with a youngster, Blevins (Lucas Black) on a fine horse, and with a fine gun that he can use very nicely (Wallet now has a hole in it!). They suspect he is a runaway who might even have stolen the horse, but let him tag along. After a rainstorm, Blevins who is afraid of lightning, loses his clothes, his gun, and his horse. Approaching the next town, he sees his horse and gun and steals them back at night. Blevins goes his separate way.John and Lacey encounter a herd of cattle and join the cowboys, get accepted as hands, break 16 horses in 4 days, inpress the owner, who asks them if they rode all the way from Texas by themselves. John notices owner's daughter, Alejandra (Penelope Cruz), she notices him, they develop a secret love affair. Owner finds out, doesn't approve, knows about Blevins, calls police on John and Lacey, who end up in jail with Blevins who had been there since they split up some weeks earlier. On the way to the penitentiary, Blevins is taken out and shot.In prison, both John and Lacey, in separate incidents, get stabbed, John killing his attacker in the mess hall. Suddenly both of them are out, bought by Alejandra's father, in return she promises not to see John anymore. He gets her phone number, calls, meets at train station, they have a night together, John asks her to go to Texas where they will live happily ever after. Next morning she refuses, saying I gave my promise, and if I don't honor that then I will have no honor.John, in a daring move, retreives the 3 horses, gets shot in the leg, finds Lacey, and they head back to Texas. Over the border they are arrested without i.d., taken to the judge (Bruce Dern) who realizes John's story is real and orders them freed. At the end John's voice is heard, There must be a God watching over us, otherwise how could we survive even a single day?
