Hemingway's deceptively simple style of prose belied an understanding of human nature at odds with the macho exterior Papa presented to the world, and whether intentional or not, this film manages to capture something of Hemingway's style while largely failing in terms of dramatic content.Much of the blame for this lies in a treatment which is inadequate to the scope of the story it attempts to relate. Largely - if not wholly - based on Hemingway's own life experiences, the film fails to capture the bluff, larger-than-life essence of the man. This is largely down to a poor choice of leading man in Gregory Peck. For my money, Peck was never more than a pretty face, and possessed an extremely limited talent. He's certainly not up to the demands made of him by the character of Harry Street, world-travelling writer, lover and heavy drinker, whose material success is tempered by a feeling of failure, both artistically and emotionally.Also culpable, though, are the shoddy standards with regards to the location shooting - second-unit only, so all the actors travelled no further than to the Fox backlot in Hollywood. This means we see Peck, lying on his 'deathbed' on what is obviously a stage set gazing out at a group of vultures perched in anticipation on a tree in the shadows of the eponymous mountain. This is so distracting that it destroys all semblance of verisimilitude.Add to that possibly the world's worst death scene - Ava Gardner does her 'woman driver' bit in the midst of a Spanish Civil War battlefield and prays for the lost love of her life to come find her only for - guess what - the love of her life to find her. Her death, also, is badly botched, occurring off-screen and referred to only once in passing afterwards.Despite all this, the film still does manage to be fairly absorbing while never scaling the heights its producers were obviously aiming for.

The shots are generic, conventional, and of television movie quality. The snow drenched scenery is gorgeous, yet the characters held with in it have a similar quality to that of looking at a photograph of such scenery, the overwhelming feeling being that of distance. Some of the editing is fairly high quality and the work of an veteran professional, the dialogue however is clunky and artificial, having little bearing on 'real' conversations at all seemingly. Any emotional insight is displaced in favour of swearing, which is of course the way in which everyone shows their true feelings. The action is slow and underwhelming, the overall feeling being one of someone trickling cold water over your head, but so slowly that you barely notice, yet eventually you feel pathetic and slightly sorry for yourself for being caught in such a incomprehensible situation.The mixture of genres that the Fessenden has seemingly tried to use; psychological thriller, horror and family drama, although commendable suffers from a serious lack of tension and interesting dialogue. The way in which the husband, wife and child trio interact is particularly unrealistic. The themes of family relationships being played out in haunting setting have been covered countless times before by far superior films, an instant example being that of The Shining (1980). The family unit here are torn by innocuous troubles which are hard to understand or sympathise with considering the relative ambiguity of the script.The family unit is hardly stalked throughout the film, Fessenden playing down the thriller possibilities of the narrative in favour of a slow family drama for the majority of the running time. The 'stalker' figure Otis has few apparent motives for his behaviour and despite being perhaps the most interesting and well acted character is still very underdeveloped. The main characters are empty husks of people who it was extremely hard to relate to, their relationships with each other being particularly void of any sentiment or feeling. Although the ignorance of the Erik per Sullivan's young character by his parents is presumably part of the story, surely any reasonable person would question their son if he allegedly spoke to someone who seemingly doesn't exist? People can accept this film as intelligent because of its relative lack of conventional aspects regarding creature based horror movies but this film fails in respect of whichever genre you wished to pigeonhole it in. You can read deep psychological meanings into every single minute detail of anything if you should so wish to but I think people would be better off over analysing their carpet for some deep emotional meaning, rather than these vacuous sub-human creations.

I don't think Blue Velvet is his best film, but I think it is the film in which he truly mastered a style which is entirely his own. Blue Velvet is the type of movie that is completely beyond generic convention. It is a romance, a crime thriller, and an experimental film all in one.The characters are bizarre, but extremely well done. The small town characters are in the beginning hokey, but as the plot becomes more complex it's almost as if the actors themselves become more serious, not just the characters. It's a beautiful symbolism for small town life; a veneer of of quiet mediocrity at face value, but with a dramatic and complex core. Dennis Hopper and Isabella Rossellini are obviously the stand-out performance, each seemingly trying to out do the other in sheer madness.The plot itself is a very interesting one, and it is told very well. One feels the determination and the helplessness of Jeffery who lunges into a world beyond his control. And it is fascinating how he manages to concur it in the end.This may not be a film that everyone will enjoy, but I think it is a film that will interest a very wide audience. I think it's a great introduction to Lynch, and an important film in modern cinema.
