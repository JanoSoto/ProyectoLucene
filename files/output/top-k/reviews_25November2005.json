[{"date":"25 November 2005","score":"","review":" Talk about a dark comedy, my god! 'Wonder Boys' involves a dead dog, a transvestite, a midlife crisis, guns, theft, adultery and Robert Downey, Jr. making it one of the grimmest so-called comedies of all time. The story follows a middle-aged acclaimed novelist turned college professor, Grady Tripp (Academy Award Winner Michael Douglas) who is going through a severe midlife crisis because he is suffering from writer's block. Grady is close to finishing his follow-up novel that could prove to everyone he's not really washed up, but can't seem to end it. To make matters worse Grady is being nagged by his ambiguously gay and unquestionably neurotic editor Terry Crabtree (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Grady is wrapped up in a heated love affair with the chancellor's (of the college where Grady teaches) wife, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand). All this changes when Grady gets close to a deeply disturbed yet brilliant writing student of his, James Leer (Tobey Maguire) who reminds Grady and his editor of themselves. Everything goes to hell when Grady and Terry bring James along with them to the chancellor's party for published authors, where James ends up killing their dog.'Wonder Boys' is an interesting film in that I don't really remember seeing anything like it. I liked it, but at the same time I had a problem with it. For a comedy, it is a very unsettling movie for reasons beyond a murdered doggie. I hated the tone of the film, but everything else I liked. The acting is spectacular with an incredible, out-of-this-world performance by Michael Douglas that should have earned him an Oscar nomination in 2000. The supporting cast is very strong with decent performances from Frances McDormand, Tobey Maguire, Katie Holmes, and especially, Robert Downey, Jr. in his best role since 1992's 'Chaplin'. The directing is great, and the writing damn well earned it's Academy Award Nomination. 'Wonder Boys' has all these great qualities, but I could barely stand watching the film because of how upsetting and disturbing the tone of it was. Watching this is like going a week without showering, you feel dirty and paranoid, and I hated feeling that way.'Wonder Boys' is a film that won't appeal to many people. It's definitely for those who have the strongest endurance for unsettling subject matter. It was a very good film, I just won't ever see it again...ever.
