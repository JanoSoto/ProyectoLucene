Specifically, they don't get the point, because they misunderstand what it's trying to do. The movie is based on the novel Eaters of the Dead, by Michael Crichton. This novel is a fictionalized history, written in the form of an epic translation (which it isn't), and recounts what happens when a group of Norsemen, accompanied by an Arab observer end up at war with a remnant population of Neandertals. Yes, Neandertals. It's not completely ridiculous, though the most recent evidence for neandertals that I know of (I'm an archaeologist) in northern Europe is about 25k before present. It didn't happen -- it's just Crichton's device, and it's a fun one. Neandertals are very close to modern people, but not the same. They are in some sense Other, and to xenophobes like medieval Norse they must have seemed, well, something like Grendel is discribed in Beowulf. When Crichton wrote this, originally in the 1970s, even less was known of Neandertals than now, thus the brutish characterization, exaggerated a bit by the movie.Once this background is adequately understood, several criticisms should disappearA. One reviewer complains that the movie isn't faithful enough to the original text, apparently believing in this case the text written by Ahmed ibn-Fahlan, and published a few years ago. This reviewer appears unaware that this is a literary conceit on the part of the actual author, Michael Crichton.B. Meanwhile, a second reviewer complains that the movie is insufficiently close to the Beowulf myth. As implied by the above, this criticism goes nowhere, because it is not a simple retelling of Beowulf. Eaters of the Dead is Crichton's effort to fictionally historicize Beowulf by placing it in the context of a struggle of Norse against a remnant population of neandertals. The 13th Warrior is a pretty accurate retelling of the encounter as envisioned by Crichton, and its relationship to Beowulf is as tangential as Crichton's.C. A review complains about the ragged mobs of bad guys, clad in bear skins for no good reason. The reason is that there is good evidence to suppose Neandertals had a ritual life oriented in some way around cave bears. They might be ragged mobs because the book, and movie, are emphasizing their primitiveness, relative to the modern humans they are fighting. I had more difficulty with Neandertal cavalry, but there isn't any particular reason to believe a remnant population of Neandertals couldn't observe the use of domesticated horses, steal some, and figure it out from there.D. I didn't think that was the lamest love interest subplot ever by far. First, the woman was gorgeous, so it can't be a waste. (heh, okay) Second, it underscores the relatively casual attitude of the norse toward sex, especially as initiated by women. This is obviously not a universal trait in medieval western cultures, and is a nice historical touch. It would have been sappier if he'd stayed or she'd followed, but neither happens. It's a moment of comfort and connection in a hopeless situation, and works well in that context.E. We have no idea how a complex Neandertal society might work -- there's no evidence to suggest they might ever have had one. For them to coalesce briefly around a few charismatic leaders, and disperse when those leaders die, is no stretch at all. In fact, it's the most likely scenario. I'm not that'd happen in the middle of a battle, but maybe it would. Who knows? After all, if they had a structured society that *didn't* depend on the presence of charismatic leaders, they'd be more visible in the archaeological record, and might have been more of a threat. It'd be a different situation, certainly. Anyway, it's Crichton's story and it works.I have no particular rebuttal to those who didn't like the characters or the acting or whatever, except to say I think they're dead wrong. And the reviewer suggesting this as MST2K material ... well...evidently doesn't know much about 13th Warrior OR MST2K. (Trying to be nice here). Hint MST2K makes fun of *bad* movies, not good ones. I love the characters and thought the chemistry was terrific. Visually, it's stunning.The movie just works great on a lot of levels. It's just a quietly great movie. Certainly on my top 10 list, and probably top 5. A lot of my friends avoided it in the theater, but when I show them the video, I haven't seen anyone not like it.

Those who cannot appreciate it, those that will not, and those who have not had the patience to do so yet.There are people who go to movies simply for the thrill factor. Or the romance. Or some other canned emotion. I don't have anything against that; I am a big fan of animated children's movies for that very reason. You can use movies as a tool to manipulate your own mood. The Fellowship movie provides the thrills and pretty girls necessary for this, but anyone who can only absorb this superficial layer of the story will feel there is something missing, because they are unable comprehend the true depth of the story being brought to life. Not to mention the fact that the movie is not an entire story. Anyone seeking emotional stimulus will leave very frustrated because this movie is merely the beginning of the story.Then there are those who claim to be able to appreciate a movie on many levels and assert this one does not hold up for varied reasons. They claim the story was flat, the acting was cheap, or the world unbelievable. Criticisms of the story must be held off until all the films can be viewed in succession. Unlike Harry Potter or Star Wars, each segment of the trilogy does not have a beginning middle and end that tie together into one big picture. The three Lord of the Rings movies ARE the beginning, middle, and end. The story was not written in volumes, intended each to be taken as a whole. This was not a three-hour movie; it was the first third of a nine-hour movie. As for criticisms of the acting, I'm tempted to say they are just preposterous. Perhaps you have to have read the novel in order to really understand how well the characters were brought to life. Ian McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf seems to be the best acting in history. If the hobbits seem too simple and childlike, it is what hobbits are. And no one but hobbits, desiring nothing but to return to their fat and everyday life in the Shire, could have both the will to do anything to protect that life and the unconcern necessary to avoid being tempted by the Ring. Sean Bean's Boromir is more believable even, I think, than Tolkien's. He takes the MAN character from the book and makes Boromir a man we all are very much aware that we could become. The absolute worst thing that could be said about the acting is that once you see the movie for the fifth or sixth time, you start to see the actor's own opinions of the story as they react to events, rather than only the character's. As for the world being unbelievable, IT IS A FANTASY STORY!!!!! If you want realism read anything from Shakespeare to Tom Clancy. If you read Tolkien, you will get elves and trolls and magic rings.And finally, there are people who just don't appreciate the story YET. I must admit, I did not like the movie the first time I saw it in the theater. It is simply too much to assimilate in one sitting. You walk away with deafened ears, a torn heart and glorious images of landscapes and battles flashing behind your eyes. If you leave it at that, this rushed and overwhelmed impression is all you will ever have.

The Fellowship movie provides the thrills and pretty girls necessary for this, but anyone who can only absorb this superficial layer of the story will feel there is something missing, because they are unable comprehend the true depth of the story being brought to life. Not to mention the fact that the movie is not an entire story. Anyone seeking emotional stimulus will leave very frustrated because this movie is merely the beginning of the story.Then there are those who claim to be able to appreciate a movie on many levels and assert this one does not hold up for varied reasons. They claim the story was flat, the acting was cheap, or the world unbelievable. Criticisms of the story must be held off until all the films can be viewed in succession. Unlike Harry Potter or Star Wars, each segment of the trilogy does not have a beginning middle and end that tie together into one big picture. The three Lord of the Rings movies ARE the beginning, middle, and end. The story was not written in volumes, intended each to be taken as a whole. This was not a three-hour movie; it was the first third of a nine-hour movie. As for criticisms of the acting, I'm tempted to say they are just preposterous. Perhaps you have to have read the novel in order to really understand how well the characters were brought to life. Ian McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf seems to be the best acting in history. If the hobbits seem too simple and childlike, it is what hobbits are. And no one but hobbits, desiring nothing but to return to their fat and everyday life in the Shire, could have both the will to do anything to protect that life and the unconcern necessary to avoid being tempted by the Ring. Sean Bean's Boromir is more believable even, I think, than Tolkien's. He takes the MAN character from the book and makes Boromir a man we all are very much aware that we could become. The absolute worst thing that could be said about the acting is that once you see the movie for the fifth or sixth time, you start to see the actor's own opinions of the story as they react to events, rather than only the character's. As for the world being unbelievable, IT IS A FANTASY STORY!!!!! If you want realism read anything from Shakespeare to Tom Clancy. If you read Tolkien, you will get elves and trolls and magic rings.And finally, there are people who just don't appreciate the story YET. I must admit, I did not like the movie the first time I saw it in the theater. It is simply too much to assimilate in one sitting. You walk away with deafened ears, a torn heart and glorious images of landscapes and battles flashing behind your eyes.

I have not seen the original and this is the first encounter with the movie that Francis Ford Coppola is obsessed with. Some have applauded this new version, others have condemned it. This is my first take, as if it was the only version around. Here goes...While F.F. Coppola is famed for his Godfather movies, he has spent his free time obsessed with his fine Vietnam War movie Apocalypse Now. In the summer of 2001, he re-issued his director's cut version and dubbed it Apocalypse Now Redux.The film's plot is pretty simple. Martin Sheen is Captain Ben Willard, a man who has already spent too much time in 'Nam that he's prone to going a bit crazy at times. Willard is sent on a mission to go into the Cambodia border and eliminate a rogue Colonel named Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando). It's the trip that's the true horror story, and it's a disturbing one. Willard and his crew find love, death, horror, bravery, and excitement throughout the 3 and a half hour film. It seems that one day they find an opulent house owned by expatriate Frenchmen and the next they find a warzone that looks like a circus that has been bombed to death. Eventually, Willard reaches Kurtz and discovers that maybe the two men have more in common than being shafted by the U.S. Army.The acting is very good, what with a cast that has Brando, Sheen, Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford, Robert Duvall, and a teenaged Laurence Fishburne. The music by F.F and Carmine Coppola is very ominous and disturbing. The violence is the same as the music strong, difficult to watch, and grisly. There are touches of M*A*S*H like humour, such as surfing in the warzone, and some memorable lines (you know which ones).Still, I didn't enjoy this one as much as Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. The film is way too long and scenes can go on forever. He portrays Vietnam as the Hell many said it was, but he overstates it way too much. They don't mar the film's grandeur; this is an epic, but it could stand to lose some running time. I liked it, but it just doesn't have as much bite as Full Metal Jacket had, nor will it be as memorable to me, but it's still a very good film. Your tastes will vary.Some notes the creative consultant was Dennis Jakob, a classmate of F.F.C. at UCLA and the man who let Jim Morrison live on his roof where he composed the songs that would make him famous. Also, now I know where they got the inspiration for the voice of Konami's Metal Gear Solid hero Solid Snake from Martin Sheen's Captain Willard.

They don't mar the film's grandeur; this is an epic, but it could stand to lose some running time. I liked it, but it just doesn't have as much bite as Full Metal Jacket had, nor will it be as memorable to me, but it's still a very good film. Your tastes will vary.Some notes the creative consultant was Dennis Jakob, a classmate of F.F.C. at UCLA and the man who let Jim Morrison live on his roof where he composed the songs that would make him famous. Also, now I know where they got the inspiration for the voice of Konami's Metal Gear Solid hero Solid Snake from Martin Sheen's Captain Willard.

This truly is a film dipped in magic waters. Why do I love this film so? The acting right across the board is naturalistic and strong. We believe the characters when they say what they say and do what they do. The whole tone and design of the film let us believe in the choices the characters make, we want Ray to build the field and have Shoeless Joe appear, we want Terrance Mann to go Finway Park with Ray, we want Archie Graham to get to play his dream, and most of all, even though we don't expect it or see it coming (well I didn't), we want Ray to get to throw a catch with his dad.> The design, again, is wonderful.

Anyone thinking they may even be slightly put off by thinking the film is a baseball film, don't be. It's not about baseball, the sport serves as the backdrop for a story about loss, reconciliation, parents and family, dreams and having the courage to go through them.

When compared to the original stage production we get plot replaced by over staged pageantry and acting replaced by posing.It is impossible to talk about Evita without considering the presence of Madonna. Not since the hunt for Scarlet O Hara was there as much chatter about the casting of a film role. The Julliard trained Patti LuPone, who created the role on the stage found it too taxing and could not do matinees. So if someone like LuPone finds the role a handful, how can Madonna do? Poorly is how. In the nearly 20 years Madonna has been around there are a few things we know about her abilities. We know she can write a good pop tune, we know she can dance. Her greatest talent is of course her ability to market herself and her worse talent is her acting. But in Evita, she sings not one song written by her, and due to her state of pregnancy during the shoot does very little dancing. About the only interesting thing about this picture is the many imaginative ways she hides her swollen abdomen; Madonna standing behind a chair, Madonna holding a huge bouquet to her waist etc. As an actress Madonna is sub-par and she simply does not have the skills to play a character that first appears as a 16 year old girl and ends as a 33 year old cancer riddled dictator's wife. So limited is her acting range, so awkward is her body language her performance is almost embarrassing to watch. But it is her greatest talent, that of marketing herself, where the pay off appears to the tune of a Golden Globe. Battling Madonna's omnipresence is the hint that this film has some sort of epic production values. We are constantly bombarded with huge crowd scenes which on even the most slightest of examination reveals the same crowd of actors, in the same location, pointing their attention to Madonna in yet another costume and hairstyle. Marketing is really the only thing Evita has going for itself. Countless people, who would never have the patience of sitting through a real opera can pat themselves on the back because they were wrongly convinced this was some great work of art. When Evita first came on to the stage in the late 70s it was ahead of the curve in dealing with a story steeped in greed, corruption and sex.

Without Logue, I wouldn't have made it halfway through the film.So, in the end, if you are looking for something deep, read Lao Tsu or Confusius. If you want something that it is entertaining and at least hints at something of substance, well, this one might be worth your time.

It was the first View Askew movie but, I saw the last one (Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) first so this movie only made more since when I saw it. I think this movie was a savior for comedic films in that it really suggests that funny films can not only make sense, but also not be degrading to your IQ.Although this movie was #210 in the top 250 films ever made, there were some flaws. Miramax should've had more trust in View Askew and given it more than 30,000 dollars. That's why the whole film had no color, no special effects (aside from the chapter listing announcing new scenes) and took place mainly in the Quick Stop. Kevin Smith is more a writer with a camera than a director. Some say that the actors in his movies are never that believable but this film was different (even though it was his first one). I really thought that Brian Christopher and Jeff Anderson did a great job 'running the Quick Stop'. This film was a great one, see it, if you know what 'Lamentation' means.

My small brain cannot comprehend how such a horrible movie could possible be made, especially with such good stars as Renee and Matthew.  I am shocked that such a horrible movie is allowed to be seen by anyone, especially on Premium Television. I know HBO isn't what it used to be, but this movie is far below the standards that premium television, and free TV alike should maintain.  I did, however enjoy watching this movie only because I'm board, and can't sleep.  After seeing this movie, I am amazed at the thought that just maybe, this is not actually the worst movie in the world, and somewhere out there, someone made a movie that made even less sence than this one.  Or maybe I just need to watch more horror movies and this one will make more sence.  After all, this is the first horror movie I saw since I was 10. Thank you to anyone who cared enough to read my thoughts on this horrible movie.
