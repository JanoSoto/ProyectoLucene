I wasn't into independent films at the time, but boy have I missed out on some great stuff.  Mainly, Breaking the Waves.  This film is one of the most brilliant and hauntingly beautiful films I have ever seen.  This is what real Cinema should be, not that Hollywood crap.  The way the movie forces you to give your all and suffer as much as the main character (Bess) suffers, is absolutely amazing.Breaking the Waves is a story about unconditional love.  The love of one being for another and the ultimate sacrifice for the beloved.  This haunting story echos the story of Christ's suffering to save humanity.  THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE!  This is the perfect story about love, devotion, and selfless sacrifice.Emily Watson gave one of the most beautiful and painful performances in the history of films.  She doesn't just ACT out Bess McNeil's character but she lives it too.  She becomes Bess and she suffers like Bess, and finally in the end, she receives redemption as Bess.  I could think of no one else as Bess but Watson.  The scenes in which she talks to God and plays both roles is pure heartbreak.  Yes, Frances was great in Fargo, but nothing compare to this.  The rightful recipient of the Best Actress Oscar is definitely Emily Watson.The recipient of Bess' unconditional love, her husband Jan, is played wonderfully by Stellan Staarsgard.  The wonderful supporting cast was vital to the effect of the story and deserves just as much acclaim.Lars von Trier shows that he is the master of real Cinema.  The panoramic shots between each act was brilliant and absolutely breathtaking.  The hand held camera shots were very necessary to give the audience a personal connection to the story.  It gives the sense of almost being there.This is a film containing a very disturbing yet beautiful story.  At times, you are ashamed by it and you feel responsibility for Bess' actions. This is not a movie for everyone.  You have to be willing to give yourself up and be willing to become violated because at times, you feel as though you are.  Watch this film with someone you love and see how they react to the message.  If anyone ever ask you what is true love and devotion and true sacrifice, recommend them this film.Bottom line is you either love it or hate it, there are no in between. Perhaps this film might offend some people or perhaps this may become a revelation to some.  However, this is not a film to be missed or taken lightly.  If you are like me, this will be one of the best films you will ever see in your life.  But definitely, this film will provoke discussion.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 August 2000","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  I had heard about Breaking the Waves on Siskel&Ebert when it came out in '96.

But if you give a chance to this thriller you will find something very original and scary...very scary!Deadly Friend is a genuinely frightening experience, it has such a great story that catches you from the beginning to the end. First of all, the plot is original and interesting - Deadly Friend isn't just another horror film, it's in parts a love story and in others it works as an old-fashioned gripping thriller that would make Hitchcock or De Palma proud of. Paul is a new kid in town, and he is a genius in computers and robots. He falls in love with the kind, sweet and vulnerable girl next door, Samantha, but everything ends up bad when Samantha's abusive father kills her. The guy freaks out and steals Samantha's body. He uses all his knowledge in machines and computer chips, and achieves to bring her back...as a killer robot!he takes her to his attic but she soon starts to kill the persons who used to humiliate her.The Cast the cast is great, terrific performances are delivered by the main actors. Kirsty Swanson is outstanding as Samantha, in the first hour of the film she is so sweet you may fall in love with her, in the last hour she is scary as hell. She is an excellent young star, and in certain ways, she reminds a lot another great young actress, Reese Witherspoon, she has that quality of delivering true-to-life, real performances, and like Reese she has an innocent beauty.Mathew Laborteaux makes a believable character, Paul is a guy who isn't a bad kid, he just is desperate to help the girl he loves but doesn't know how to deal with the consequences of his acts.The Director Wes Craven once again hits big time!this is one of his greatest films, but it will be a surprise for his fans because, instead of what they saw in The Hills Have Eyes and in most of Craven's films, Deadly Friend isn't so violent. Of course, you get some blood and guts here, but the deaths are relative low. If you want to see a body count, go rent Hellbound Hellraiser 2. Craven's goal here is that he sustains some kind of genuine suspense during the whole film with mastery, something that just Alfred Hitchcok used to do well.The Story in just one word - OUTSTANDING!this is a different, compelling story, it's a gripping tale that mixes such elements like love and horror, it's an appealing and charming material.If you want to watch something really good, rent this great movie!here you will find suspense, humor, horror and love.

From an emotional point of view, this film has more resonance than, say, Annie Hall, or Sweet and Lowdown, although those two films had plenty of emotion. Manhattan was clearly made by someone who just loves making films, and it shows. Woody Allen's love affair with New York is obviously on display here, and this movie contains his absolute his finest shots. And he doesn't hedge his bets with the shots in this movie, from the wide expansive shots of the city to the way he incorporates the set, to the way he takes advantage of spacial orientation, this film contains Allen's most interesting work from a purely technical point of view.

The other good thing about this film was that we just saw enough of the confederate army to know they existed.........and that was all we needed.  For example, in Gettysburg, I didnt know who the hell I was barracking for at the end of it....oh yeah it was cr**p too (they tried to fit way too much in and I liken the actor roles in that film to the substitutes on a bench during a footy game who finally get a run).Ok so what else was great about this film.  The screenplay, the story, the actors, especially the hundreds of African American extras who played the soldiers of the 54th Massachusets.

I hope George Lucas watches this movie, so he can get back on track, and remind himself on how a Space-Opera is done.This is how you do it. It couldn´t have been any better. People who point the fact that the screenplay is not the most elaborated or that there are plenty of unscientific facts in it, apparently don´t notice this is purely a 30´s and 40´s,  Space-Opera. Adventures in space, heroic characters, big bad alien civilizations and huge spaceships, this is all it matters in the genre that George Lucas revived and which was created in the 1930´s by the writer E.E.Doc Smith. Scientific credibility is not important here. Space-Operas were and always will be Fantasy stories set in space, despite being included as a sub-genre of sci-fi. A good mix of classical clichés is more important for this type of stories than anything else. It´s this good mix of situations and references that´s been missing from George Lucas saga since ROTJ or EPISODE-I, but are perfectly accomplished in TITAN-AFTER EARTH. E.E.DOC SMITH would be proud of this story and i´m sure he would love the film.This movie is the best Space-Opera, since the original STAR WARS, and it´s a shame that many people thought it was just another kids movie, as it is an animation movie. This is not a movie for little kids, people. This is a serious action adventure space-opera, which happens to be made in animation. There are no cute little characters or humor for little children to enjoy. Just credible characters, some sexual subtle references and a little violence, not usually found in movies for young ages.The animation is brilliant, the computer special effects are totally mind blowing, it is set in truly original landscapes and alien enviroments, the plot couldn´t be more excelent as it uses all the classical references brilliantly and it even has some surprises in it, and above all it´s a great roller coaster ride. I guess the only thing that annoyed me, was the soundtrack, which looks a bit out of place in a story like this. Then again at the same time, by not using a full traditional orchestral music soundtrack TITAN gets an atmosphere of its own wich works great. A miracle, considering some of the musics in this movie are truly awful and almost ruin the action on the screen.By the way, if you liked this, try to find an old movie called STARCHASER, which almost can be considered the father of TITAN A.E. (check my review), as it was the first animation Space-Opera not for kids who also used computer animation for many bits. And both have more or less the same atmosphere actualy.Anyway, if you like space-operas, and specialy if you´re a fan of the 30´s and 40´s Doc Smith novels, you can´t miss this movie. TITAN A.E, is the best space adventure in decades ! And much, much better than any recent real image special effects movie extravaganza.Trully a must see. I WANT MORE ! -) MORE !

Spielberg is truly a master director.  Finally someone has accurately portrayed what it was like in battle.  From the ultra-realistic depiction of gore and violence to the drama of the dying medic (get to that later)and most importantly portraying the wounded in battle.  I also like the way Spielberg kind of exposed, or degraded the film to kind of give it an old, gritty look to it, very nice effect.  Saving Private Ryan is, honestly in my opinion, Speilberg at his directing best.  However, there are a few gripes. First off, I have yet to see a war movie which combined all of the needed elements to make it the best war movie ever!  Full Metal Jacket is close but no cigar.  Anyway one of the most important of these elements would be character development, in which case Saving Private Ryan had none. The whole story behind Saving Private Ryan was to figure out who the old man was.  And what little character development they did have turned out to be fruitless and not very interesting.  Another element missed was emotion. True, the soldiers frightened faces and yells of mass hysteria was great and all, but I thought if this movie would some how have implemented a narration of some kind, then maybe I would care for the main characters a bit more. Third element missing was the plot.  What can you do in 3 hours when the whole plot revolves around going out to find someone.  Walk a little talk a little, fight, walk a little talk a little fight, die, fight, walk.  It seemed kind of muddled and boring.  And another gripe, which isn't really a big deal, is how the medic died.  What the hell is he doing charging at a machine gun nest?  Since medics aren't allowed to carry weapons, I was just pondering why they would have him run along with them.  I mean, what's he going to do when he gets to the enemy, heal them to death?  Or maybe, just maybe, if he was in syringe range he could take an enemy out with a critical stab, ahhh die Germans die!!! Anyway, with all gripes aside, I still loved this movie.

It remains one of my all time favorite films, yet I haven't been able to bring myself to watch it a second time, but I have not been able to forget it.The acting is what makes the film hold together, more specifically River Phoenix's performance. The other three leads were also exceptional, as were the lesser characters (including Kiefer Sutherland and newcomer John Cusack), but it was River's performance that really stood out. His performace is a rarity among actors, child or not, in that it doesn't seem the least bit forced, it seems all natural, and that is the one reason this movie is so great. This may be the only major movie I've ever seen where the producers have allowed child actors to command the film, with the adults in much smaller roles.It's 430 AM here, and I haven't slept for about 18 hours, so it's a bit hard for me to form ideas in my mind, then remember them long enough to type, so I'm going to keep this as short as possible, so I don't risk making a complete fool out of myself, if that makes any sense.One last thing I wanted to post is a short blurb from a River Phoenix fansite on an.... interesting incident that happened during filming of 'Stand by Me'. This is something new I've never tried doing when posting a comment, so hopefully it won't be rejected by IMDb. Actually, it might be just as well if it is...Just as the film portrayed four boys passing through adolescence, so it was with the cast members. With sex being just about the only topic of conversation the boys talked to each other about, River became enamoured with an eighteen-year-old family friend who offered to 'initiate him'. No only did his parents give their blessing, but they made the occasion a celebration and pitched a tent in their back garden ready for the event.Next day of course, River arrived on the set with a huge grin from ear to ear, telling not only his three fellow cast members about his adventure but anyone else who happened to be around! River also wrote to Joe Dante, the director of his previous film and now a close friend, a letter that read simply WELL IT HAPPENED, IT FINALLY HAPPENED.This may be the greatest story of lost virginity I've ever heard, said Rob Reiner. A very strange experience was River's description of the event. She was very patient with me and told me what to do.Unfortunately, River's insatiable curiosity was not limited just to sex. It was during the making of this movie that marked the first time he smoked marijuana. Corey Feldman went into River's room one day to find him getting high. I had been doing it too, said Feldman, but it was one of those things where we really didn't want to let each other know what we were doing. Later in his career River was to say, Stand By Me was a weird time for me as a person. I was going through a lot of doubt, a lot of insecurity. A lot of things like that you go through at fourteen. I was going through puberty and I was hurting real bad.

His performace is a rarity among actors, child or not, in that it doesn't seem the least bit forced, it seems all natural, and that is the one reason this movie is so great. This may be the only major movie I've ever seen where the producers have allowed child actors to command the film, with the adults in much smaller roles.It's 430 AM here, and I haven't slept for about 18 hours, so it's a bit hard for me to form ideas in my mind, then remember them long enough to type, so I'm going to keep this as short as possible, so I don't risk making a complete fool out of myself, if that makes any sense.One last thing I wanted to post is a short blurb from a River Phoenix fansite on an.... interesting incident that happened during filming of 'Stand by Me'. This is something new I've never tried doing when posting a comment, so hopefully it won't be rejected by IMDb. Actually, it might be just as well if it is...Just as the film portrayed four boys passing through adolescence, so it was with the cast members. With sex being just about the only topic of conversation the boys talked to each other about, River became enamoured with an eighteen-year-old family friend who offered to 'initiate him'. No only did his parents give their blessing, but they made the occasion a celebration and pitched a tent in their back garden ready for the event.Next day of course, River arrived on the set with a huge grin from ear to ear, telling not only his three fellow cast members about his adventure but anyone else who happened to be around! River also wrote to Joe Dante, the director of his previous film and now a close friend, a letter that read simply WELL IT HAPPENED, IT FINALLY HAPPENED.This may be the greatest story of lost virginity I've ever heard, said Rob Reiner. A very strange experience was River's description of the event. She was very patient with me and told me what to do.Unfortunately, River's insatiable curiosity was not limited just to sex. It was during the making of this movie that marked the first time he smoked marijuana. Corey Feldman went into River's room one day to find him getting high. I had been doing it too, said Feldman, but it was one of those things where we really didn't want to let each other know what we were doing. Later in his career River was to say, Stand By Me was a weird time for me as a person. I was going through a lot of doubt, a lot of insecurity. A lot of things like that you go through at fourteen.

But rather than backing away from some of the jokier elements of Guy Hamilton's Goldfinger and embracing again the (relative) realism of Young's own Dr No and From Russia With Love, Thunderball represents another small step on the downward slide that would result in simply horrible later entries like Diamonds are Forever and Live and Let Die. Sean Connery is confident and rugged as Bond, of course, so it's not as bad as it seems.  But the plot gets bogged down in all of the tedious underwater sequences.

However, as far as storytelling goes, Irwin Kershner does so much better.There are two reasons why this should be considered the best of all three; oh no wait, four, if you count The Phantom Mess, which I'm still bitter about for the fact that it will forever remain as a part of the Star Wars saga -- one drop of ink will make the entire vat of water black, and that's what happened.  Anyway, the first reason The storytelling is amazing.  It was appropriately paced and appropriately lengthy.  It does much better development of later plot lines than any of the other movies.  The romance between Solo and Leia, for example, is done ever so gently and craftily. Luke is finally acting like a decent actor, as his character goes through major transformation from a reckless, brash jedi wannabe to a man whose identity was completely turned upside down.  And what about Darth Vader, the greatest villain in cinematic history?

Spacey won an oscar for his performence, and you can see why.  His character is also the narrator, who tells the rest of the film like a story - so we see the events in retrospect.  Del Toro is great as Fenster, whose dialect is deliberately hard to understand.  Pollak has a great role, Baldwin is just right as the nutty psychopath and Byrne adds a little Irish tang to the events.
