[{"date":"2 June 2011","score":"","review":" Bowfinger is wacky out there and very funny, Martin & Murphy combine well to make the comedy work well, Murphy does very well to say he plays 2 different roles Kitt and Jiff Ramsey two brother's who are 2 extremes apart, the way Martin and his team blunder there way through the science fiction production at any cost to make there film with Kit playing the lead role without him knowing is a very clever plot, however the film often is OTT and Matin and Murphy often try to steal the screen too much, The scene with the dog in heels is hilarious and the way Kit looses his mind through paranoia because of Martins antics. my rating is 7 out of 10 for this film.

Buschemi is very good playing the lead role as we usually see him playing cameo roles. If you are a film maker like myself I would recommend watching this film, other films similar to this such as The Independent, Bowfinger and the small indie film's American Movie and Le Fear hold weight in this genre, however Liing in Oblivion has to edge it for me and has it all when it comes to films in this genre, it also has a back story which makes it more interesting as both lead actors Catherine Keener and James LeGros have a fling and the atmosphere on set is intense. my rating for this movie is 8 out of 10.
