[{"date":"6 November 2009","score":"0 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Aliens have been picking up Earthling TV signals for years. They are particularly intrigued by the exploits of a space ship captain and his sidekicks saving the universe from yecchy cosmic invaders. Little do they know it's make believe, and try to get this galactic benefactor to save their planet from naughty space creatures.Obviously, a playful mockery of Star Trek. For the most part, it works. There's a Kurk takeoff, a poor man's Spock, and several other impersonated Enterprise regulars. Former alien-blaster Sigourney Weaver calms down to be the captain's (Tim Allen) latest curvaceous romantic interest. The aliens that look to them for salvation are played as jokes, but the film fools itself. These ingenuous ET's are actually likable. But, when they are violently oppressed by ruthless cruelty, the movie derails from its comic intent.The blurring of fantasy and realty of the last portion of the movie creates an awkward balance, and collapses the story. Poking fun at trekkie conventions is a fun sight gag once (due to the plot's premise), but only once. To weave the trekkies joke in to the the final climactic battle makes the wheels come off completely. The last 15 minutes of the film are utterly useless, except for a pretty clever epilogue sequence about the Galaxy Quest series coming back on the air.Poorly constructed in places, but worthy of a single viewing. You probably won't want to revisit this for a second quest, though.

In Pumpkinhead, we meet a backwoods grocer named Ed Harley (finely portrayed by Lance Henriksen), who makes a deal with a witch woman called Haggis after his young son is killed in a hit-and-run accident. The witch (arguably one of the nastiest looking in screen history) thus unleashes the eponymous demon to mete vengeance on the dirt-biking city kids. Pumpkinhead itself, it must be said, is a rather pleasing creation (even though Winston did not contribute to its construction), vaguely resembling the alien from Aliens and, not coincidentally, Ed Harley himself; it is hardly the walking jack-o'-lantern you might be expecting! Winston's film is more impressive in its first half, with some touching sequences between Ed and his cute son, a very spooky visit to the witch's abode on Black Ridge, and a gripping scene of the demon rebirthing. The second half of the picture strikes this viewer as being more conventional, with the kids--an unfortunately undifferentiated lot--getting slaughtered one by one by ol' Pumpkinhead, who might as well be Michael Myers or Freddy Krueger at this point. Still, first-timer Winston keeps things moving nicely, utilizes some great-looking nighttime cinematography, and keeps his picture taut and exciting. With its hillbilly setting and awesome monster, Pumpkinhead turns out to be a fairly unique, superior example of imaginative, modern-day horror.

I have not seen this movie before. I liked the performance of the little boy named Elliott who played very well for his age. He was innocent but very mature. Steven Spielberg used good effects. The movie showed another vision of an alien who is not like a monster here but has feelings as a human. He became attached at last.I would recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it, to spend a good time with this famous movie. The movie was made for children but also for adults who can return to their childhood. I also liked the relationship between Elliott and E.T which was very strong. The end of the movie was touching and made me cry.
