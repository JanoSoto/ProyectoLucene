When Leonard starts functioning like a proper human being, it's joyous to watch. Leonard had spent most of his life in a catatonic state due to an encephalitis epidemic years ago. Watching Leonard be constantly catatonic is not pleasant to witness, so when he does start functioning rather normally, it was very uplifting. I'm often quite selfish, and so are others. I worry about meaningless things in life, whilst Leonard was simply just jovial to be fully alert. He enjoyed simple things, such as fresh air, walks, smiling. We often forget how precious life is and how it can be taken away from you in an instant. Robin Williams is technically the lead in this film and he gives a flawless show. Williams is an exceptionally talented comedian, but what people forget once in a while, is some of the standout serious roles he's given us over the years. I loved how he evolved in the second half; going from a confident & optimistic, into irreparably beaten as he spends more and more time with Leonard near the end. His scenes with DeNiro are a treat to witness. Robert DeNiro is just as good, perhaps even Oscar worthy. He looked, acted, and felt like someone that was catatonic.

The little girl and her mother were really weird - something really off about their acting that made them both irritating & unlikable. The father was bland as can be as well as completely stupid. The story itself was mostly boring - except Zelda, who was pretty neat. The few jump-scares you could see coming a mile off and there wasn't much to be genuinely scared about anyway.

I wished for more back-story on the burial ground and less about the boring self-involved family. A bit more about the town and how they'd dealt with the burial ground, more about Zelda - that sort of thing. And the Indian burial ground & semetary just weren't anywhere near spooky enough. So much more could have been done with that. Also I wish they'd done a lot more with Jud. Made Jud sinister instead of guilt-ridden & weak perhaps. There was one moment when he grinned in an evil way at the idiot father & I thought for a second he was going to be an interesting twist in the story, but alas it was not to be. I would have liked a story-line where he was somehow involved in the nastiness and survived triumphant at the end. Or where he saved the day.

This is obviously the main reason for watching it. The other reason for watching is that it so much more than just a ghost train ride. This film is actually beautiful. From Jerry Goldsmiths wonderful score, I.L.M's SFX still looking good after thirty years and still better than some things out now. Mathew F Leonetti's photography and last but not least, the cast; especially JoBeth Williams, Craig T Nelson and Beatrice Straight. These actors prove themselves as dramatists and make us believe what we see.In my humble opinion they all do a great job of bringing the drama. For me, these are the reasons to watch this film again and again. This film brings to life the horror comic book story's I loved as a kid like Tales from the Grave and The Nightcomers. Unlike a lot of tales of the supernatural on film lately,it is not spending an hour watching a door open slightly due to perhaps an unseen presence or maybe subsidence. This is seeing the door being ripped off its hinges by a force that has dropped the veil and allowed us to glimpse the howling twisted monster that awaits us on the other side and all in Metrocolor. Rather than a remote old mansion in an over gloomy setting, we are placed within the sun-kissed California hills, in a valley under a cobalt blue sky with an ordinary family whose youngest child Carol Anne becomes the conduit for the souls of the dead propelled by a terrible evil enabling them to escape the world of the dead and break through roaring, laughing and screaming into the world of the living with CarolAnne exclaiming Their heeeeeere!!!. Craig T Nelson is just superb as Steven Freeling being the man-in-the-sketch and JoBeth Williams as the enthusiastic mother and brave matriarch is just fantastic. The whole movie has a Steven King quality and style to it with the slow build reaching to a draw dropping finale.All of it laced with humor and some scenes played for laughs which are very funny. I do believe that this is a classic film and a must see. For me,the film delivered everything I ever wanted from a story of the supernatural.If you haven't seen it yet, then get it! Then get the beers in,the chips n dips, turn down the lights and enjoy.

Mathew F Leonetti's photography and last but not least, the cast; especially JoBeth Williams, Craig T Nelson and Beatrice Straight. These actors prove themselves as dramatists and make us believe what we see.In my humble opinion they all do a great job of bringing the drama. For me, these are the reasons to watch this film again and again. This film brings to life the horror comic book story's I loved as a kid like Tales from the Grave and The Nightcomers. Unlike a lot of tales of the supernatural on film lately,it is not spending an hour watching a door open slightly due to perhaps an unseen presence or maybe subsidence. This is seeing the door being ripped off its hinges by a force that has dropped the veil and allowed us to glimpse the howling twisted monster that awaits us on the other side and all in Metrocolor. Rather than a remote old mansion in an over gloomy setting, we are placed within the sun-kissed California hills, in a valley under a cobalt blue sky with an ordinary family whose youngest child Carol Anne becomes the conduit for the souls of the dead propelled by a terrible evil enabling them to escape the world of the dead and break through roaring, laughing and screaming into the world of the living with CarolAnne exclaiming Their heeeeeere!!!. Craig T Nelson is just superb as Steven Freeling being the man-in-the-sketch and JoBeth Williams as the enthusiastic mother and brave matriarch is just fantastic. The whole movie has a Steven King quality and style to it with the slow build reaching to a draw dropping finale.All of it laced with humor and some scenes played for laughs which are very funny. I do believe that this is a classic film and a must see. For me,the film delivered everything I ever wanted from a story of the supernatural.If you haven't seen it yet, then get it! Then get the beers in,the chips n dips, turn down the lights and enjoy.

I've first seen her in Equilibrium at the moment of her death (mostly the only good scene in the movie), when I understood how deep emotionally this person is.

However this is without a doubt one of the best westerns of all-time and my favorite western of all-time. I know some people criticize this film for not being historically accurate or a shallow attempt to be a hip western. Well, the truth is this film is not 100% accurate with history but what movie is? I liked the idea of this being a hip western staring Hollywood's brat pack with rock music playing in the background. I think it fits because this is basically a story about Billy the kid, a outlaw who was under 20 years old so it makes sense to give this one a younger or hipper feel to it. I like the Billy the kid story and I've seen many movies about him but this is the best one for 3 reasons. 1 I liked that they started from the beginning, other films focus on the later years when he met Pat Garret. 2 I like that this is more about the gang and not just about Billy. 3 Emilio Estevez is the best Billy the kid. I think the story is very well done, it's the best depiction of the Lincoln county war in New Mexico and the changes made were for the better. Like in real life John Tunstall was only twenty something and their were about a dozen or so regulaters not just the 6 shown here but the changes made worked for the better. The film is well directed by Chris Cain with a great balance of action, humor and is appropriately violent. I also like the look of the film, it really makes you feel like their in the wild west during 1878 and not on some sound stage. It also has a great cast! With the great Terrance Stamp who's perfectly cast as John Tunstall, an older English man who takes in six young rebellious men to work at his cattle ranch. The villain is the always great Jack Palance as Murphy, who kills Tunstal, starting the war. The 6 young boys search for justice so they become sheriffs but thanks to Billy killing everyone who they're supposed to arrest, they become outlaws. I LOVE Emillio Estevez as Billy the Kid. I know many would say his interpretation is not historically accurate but I think it's much more the way we would like to imagine the kid. Emillio gives one of his best performances and he was cheated out of an Oscar nomination. I think they did a great job in blending a lot of color to the kid. Billy is a lot of things in this movie, he's cocky, rebellious, trigger-happy, a little crazy, a loyal friend, and charming. Billy is perfectly portrayed as an anti-hero like he should be. Emillio always makes him likable even if we know he's a little crazy. I do like how they make Billy a little crazy as he takes pleasure in killing his enemies. His kills are marked by his unforgettable giggle, I love Emillio's lunatic sounding laugh. Billy is fearless who enjoys the thrill of life or death situations. But despite his wild behavior he's extremely loyal to his friends which gives him a lot of heart. Kiefer Sutherland is great as the more sensitive Doc, one of my favorite performances of his. I love Lou Diamond Phillips as Chavez Y Chavez, possibly his best role and I love his knife skills. Dermot Mulloney is great as dirty Steve and he has a lot of funny moments. Casey Siemasko is great as Charlie, the more scared one of the bunch. I love Charlie Sheen as Dick, the appointed leader of the gang. I like how he fought for leadership of the regulators with his real life brother Emillio as Billy. I like the name of the gang as the regulators, that's a cool name. The film has non stop action, good humor, good characters and the theme of friendship works well here.I love the rock'n'roll theme music.

I think that there could've been a better fit for that role, but with that said, she did fine. Other than Hjejle, there was an all star supporting cast in this movie Jack Black, Joan Cusack, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Tim Robbins to name a few! These guys all helped make the movie fun and memorable ... especially Black who stole more than a few scenes!Top 5 ... is the running theme throughout the film. A break-up with his long term, live-in girlfriend inspires him to re-live his Top 5 break-ups. He contacts his past girlfriends to meet and rehash the past in order to understand what went wrong?. As is typical in most relationships there are 2 sides to every story-Rob has a few surprises thrust upon him along the way. The audience has a few surprises about Rob served up to them as well. I think Hornby did a great job creating a truly 3-dimensional character; one that has faults but is still appealing. Cusack did a great job showing all sides of Rob.The record store, Championship Vinyl, supplies us with 2 lovable misfits (Barry-Black and Dick) who were hired for part- time but never seem to leave. All three play off each other well creating a chemistry that guarantees laughs. The Top 5 theme carries on into the shop in a few different ways. My favorite example of this is when they pose a question such as name the Top 5 songs about death and then the three of them will try to beat each other to death with their musical snobbery ... which they do to their customers on a daily basis! Music is present throughout the entire film. It is so essential to the plot that one could make the case that music is the glue that holds this film together or even better it's the gas in which it runs on for those 113 minutes.All in all, this is an absolutely excellent film which I highly recommend! It is still, after all of these years, one of my favorites. The story of Rob's midlife crisis is a classic tale that everyone can relate to but is told in such a creative way and gives a fresh perspective which is what keeps it current.

Now that sounds simple right? Well looks can be deceiving as there are many twists and turns and it all takes place in this plaza and in a few other places as well. Bruce Willis as John McClain is such a bad-ass in this movie and is easily one of the best action characters ever written. He's funny, vulgar, and overall a real character that you care for. But how can I forget one of the best villains ever in movie history Hans Gruber. Alan Rickman plays this absolutely entertaining as hell villain and he is very different from other villains as he is very unpredictable and changes his plans when things go wrong and being calm and collect about it. His plans are absolutely deviously clever in this film. I wont go into much detail as it will spoil the movie. Alan Rickman is just so entertaining when hes on screen.

The film speaks to the lives we live and i think the director is making a point about free will, or the concept of it. There are choices we get to make in life, and there are situations that are thrust upon us that we have no control over. Going to Vietnam, Getting married, Being the type of hunter who is majestic and believes in a principle ( one shot ) or runs around like a sloppy drunk shooting nonsense into the air... these are the choices that we make in our life. Then there is the gun. You have no choice on if the bullet is in the chamber, or if it is not. The only choice you should have is if you play the game, that choice was taken from these young men which effected them all differently. 1) De Niro plays the idealistic character, the type who believes in things more important than hedonistic pleasure. This is why when he hunts, he uses the one bullet belief, and there is a moment between him and his prey. 2) Walken plays the agnostic type view, he neither hates nor loves the idealism of De Niro, but instead takes no stance on it at first and simply reflects on the beauty of the tree's and wondering if he is an asshole or not. 3) Steve forget the actor's name, but he represents the boy who never really became a man, his thoughts are never deeply explored, but his actions reveal his thoughts, that he neither holds idealism or can rely strictly on self reflection and earthly delights. the effects of Gun on eachDe Niro De Niro's idealism goes out the window when presented with life or death questions, he is the closest to being a theist in his views and becomes an atheist in that murky rat filled water. We know this when he tells Walken they are going to abandon Steve. De Niro throws any sense of idealism out the window from then on out, and realizes that we cannot make and uphold our's or anyone else's rules... that we only have choices and reactions to our situations. De Niro's abandonment of his idealism is what saves him, and why he does not kill the deer at the end, he has learned that life it's self, or the joy of the hunt is the true purpose, and not the idealism of actually killing your prey with one shot. Walken Walkens character at first can deal with the situation, but becomes stuck in that moment and cannot escape it. He has no idealism to loose, and now the beauty of the tree's has gone, and he has nothing left but self reflection. He cannot get past why the bullet was not in the chamber for him, and must repeat the situation until he feels he has taken control back over his life, of course he can only do this by ending his life. Steve Steve being the eternal boy he is needs to be saved, cracks first, and is dependent on everyone else. In the end we realize our own traditions and idealism or lack there of lead us to certain points, some we can over come and some we cannot.

However, the international police force are investigating Harry for racketeering and are not convinced he is dead &#x85;I find it hard to identify with many of Graham Greene's characters, probably because I was forced to read The Power And The Glory when I was at school. He wrote the story directly for the screen but I find him a very uncinematic writer - the setup is good but it doesn't go anywhere. Instead, Holly and Anna spend the whole film talking about Harry and feeling sorry for themselves. They're both besotted with him, and his character is built up so much that when Welles finally appears it's a blessed relief - except he's only on-screen for about ten minutes and turns out to be a slimeball. What does this mean and whom are we supposed to root for ? Despite this, the movie is beautiful to watch and highly original. Robert Krasker's Dutch angle photography is outstanding throughout, and the shots of bombed out Vienna alone make it a fascinating piece of modern history. Reed's direction is tight and poignant, emphasising Holly's foreigner status and resigned acceptance of Harry's criminal exploits, and Anton Karas' justly famous zither music is a unique and dynamic accompaniment to the action. Many critics hail it as one of the best movies of all time (it won the 1949 Grand Prix at Cannes), but, like many other so-called all-time greats (Lawrence Of Arabia, Some Like It Hot, Cabaret), I struggle to see why. It's well worth seeing, but then so is Russ Meyer's Mudhoney. Produced by heavyweights Alexander Korda and David O. Selznick.

Robert Krasker's Dutch angle photography is outstanding throughout, and the shots of bombed out Vienna alone make it a fascinating piece of modern history. Reed's direction is tight and poignant, emphasising Holly's foreigner status and resigned acceptance of Harry's criminal exploits, and Anton Karas' justly famous zither music is a unique and dynamic accompaniment to the action. Many critics hail it as one of the best movies of all time (it won the 1949 Grand Prix at Cannes), but, like many other so-called all-time greats (Lawrence Of Arabia, Some Like It Hot, Cabaret), I struggle to see why. It's well worth seeing, but then so is Russ Meyer's Mudhoney. Produced by heavyweights Alexander Korda and David O. Selznick. Trivia - Alida Valli, a great Italian actress who subsequently starred in horror classics Les Yeux Sans Visage and Suspiria, is billed using only her surname.

However, the international police force are investigating Harry for racketeering and are not convinced he is dead &#x85;I find it hard to identify with many of Graham Greene's characters, probably because I was forced to read The Power And The Glory when I was at school. He wrote the story directly for the screen but I find him a very uncinematic writer - the setup is good but it doesn't go anywhere. Instead, Holly and Anna spend the whole film talking about Harry and feeling sorry for themselves. They're both besotted with him, and his character is built up so much that when Welles finally appears it's a blessed relief - except he's only on-screen for about ten minutes and turns out to be a slimeball.

From the first word spoken to the last you can see and hear how well written the script was. It was ahead of it's time in 1950 and, in 2013, cannot be redone without failing. There was much hullabaloo about who would play Norma Desmond. And, although she may have not been the first choice, Gloria Swanson nailed it in the role of a lifetime. The role of any actress' lifetime. Miss Swanson's performance touches the border of being campy and too over the top. But, in just touching the border and never crossing it, she left behind not only one of the greatest performances by an American actress, on film, but one of the most indelible film characters of all time. They remade Psycho and it failed. This film should never be remade. The only actress that could possibly fill Miss Swanson's shoes is Meryl Streep. And, she is too fine and smart an actress to attempt it. It is an impossible role to recreate. This movie has provided us with so many memorable lines & scenes. I only hope that younger people continue to appreciate the depth and range and how very special and brilliant this film, its script and cinematography are.

I loved all of the characters and even got into the spin-off specials and series. As a baby-sitter my self and girly girl, these books were my favorite. I found out that there was a 1995 film years later, as a matter of fact right when I had passed my phase of reading the series. I was in a for a wonderful ride.It was an amazing series to see the characters I grew up with come to life in this film. I got to see the traits I loved and hated about them in a movie setting. The movie draws on so many emotions as it makes you laugh, cry, and feel tender. When I return to this movie as a young woman, it makes me feel so nostalgic and get more out of it than as a child. It explores friendship, family conflict, coming of age, and so much more. I recommend it to anyone who has read the books.
