[{"date":"29 June 2012","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight ClubI will go ahead and break the rule and simply talk about Fight Club; the 1999 film that I recently added to my favorite movie list. In my opinion this is one of Fincher's masterpieces along with Se7en. David Fincher has made some great films, but none have ever rivaled his work in the 90's with these two films. Both Se7en and Fight Club are among my favorite films and consider them superior to Fincher's other great recent films like Zodiac, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, The Social Network, and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Fight Club is an extremely violent film, but I don't think it's gratuitous because the movie really works as a satire and raises several philosophical questions about how enslaved we've become under the capitalist and advertising system, but it also points out the danger of anarchy as well. We've become materialist beings finding our purpose in our possessions and have left out the spiritual part. Sometimes we need to feel pain to remind ourselves that we are alive, and in a way this film works as a highly crafted metaphor. I loved the way the story was presented and how this surrealistic film worked. Based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name, and adapted for the screen by Jim Uhls, Fight Club is a masterpiece thanks to Fincher's direction and the performance from the excellent cast which includes Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helen Bonham Carter. I really loved this movie from beginning to end, including the twist in the final act. 1999 was the year of great twists considering this is when The Sixth Sense was released as well (my all time favorite film). Fight Club is a must see film for all.The movie begins with a scene where the narrator (Edward Norton) has a gun forced down his throat by Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), to which the narrator begins to tell the viewer what has led him to this point through voice over narration, and so the film is told in flashback. He takes us back to the days when he was an office worker who experienced severe insomniac problems. The doctor recommended that he visit a support group with men who have suffered from testicular cancer in order for him to really see the pain other people have gone through. Despite not suffering from this condition, the narrator decides to do so and discovers that going to these therapies allows him to finally being able to sleep for the first time in months. After this, he decides to attend a different support group every night and everything seems to go well, until he discovers a manic depressive woman named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) who is doing the same thing he's been doing jumping from one support group to another. Seeing her as an intruder and a liar, the narrator can no longer find peace in the support groups and so his insomniac problems begin again. His life will change dramatically when he meets Tyler Durden, a soap maker, in an airplane and has an interesting conversation with him. They exchange numbers and when the narrator arrives home from the airport he discovers his condo has been blown up. He then decides to call Tyler and ends up moving in with him at an old abandoned complex. The two start a very different support group which they call Fight Club since they have to fight one another. The movement becomes popular and little by little they begin to form a revolutionary movement known as Project Mayhem, but things begin to escalate too fast and dangerously. Edward Norton appeared in the big movie screen during the 90's and this was when he made his best films (American History X, Primal Fear, The People vs. Larry Flynt, Rounders, and Fight Club), although I would have to argue that his best performances were in American History X and The 25th Hour. However he is still excellent in this film as well. Brad Pitt is at his best playing the sort of chaotic and anarchic character who in some ways is similar to the narrator, but in others very different and more dangerous. He has a strong pull on Norton's character and influences him deeply. Helena Bonham Carter also plays one of her best roles as this sort of manic-depressive character who stands her own ground in this mostly male dominated film. The performance from the cast is one of the best things about Fight Club which works in every level. The visuals and special effects are also fantastic. It is a dark film with a lot of violence mixed with satire that had me laughing quite a bit. I absolutely loved this movie and the ending was just brilliant.http\/\/estebueno10.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"29 June 2012","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight ClubI will go ahead and break the rule and simply talk about Fight Club; the 1999 film that I recently added to my favorite movie list.

Through its story the movie shows that in a seemingly peaceful and simple-minded community there can often be a different world, hiding beneath the surface &#x96; a violent and mysterious society that is able to terrorize the city with its sinful wrongdoings. In Lumberton, a small town, where ordinary people talk in clichés straight out of TV sitcoms, everything seems to be in exact order, up until a young college student Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan) comes back to visit his hospitalized father. On his first day back he discovers a severed human ear somewhere on the ground. When the police investigation isn't sufficient enough for his taste, Jeffrey, with the help of a pretty neighborhood girl Sandy (Laura Dern), decides to search for clues and stumbles onto a dangerous drug-dealing gang of perverts, loosely connected to a woman named Dorothy (Isabella Rossellini), who lives in a filthy apartment downtown. In a typically Hitchcockian scene, Jeffrey observes (standing in the closet) a very disturbing scene of masochistic sexual play, involving Dorothy and a sick, drug-inhaling stranger Frank (Dennis Hopper). He finds out that the woman is forced to be a sex slave for Frank, as he kidnapped her husband and son for the sake of sheer pleasure. Jeffrey goes on a thrilling and life-changing ride (both literally and figuratively) in order to solve the case.The film is showed on two totally opposing levels of reality. That, perhaps, is the main reason why it becomes less appealing. On one hand, we have the corny and ironic look on the townsfolk, and on the other we have the dark, violent and cold-blooded sequences of sexual depravity, perversion and brutality. The sudden changes only downgrade the powerful tension coming out of the screen and somehow convince the viewer that Lynch wasn't perfectly sure what he wanted to show and what he wanted to omit. If the movie had been kept in the same, perversely expressive mood, it would surely be received as one of the best erotic thrillers in the history. But the divergence between the two portrayed realms at times reminds of a person, who suddenly stops telling a scary story and blasts all the suspense away.Rossellini gives a fantastic performance, showing how courageous and persuasive she can be in a role. Through a series of sexual tortures Dorothy realizes that she actually is a masochist, and takes great pleasure in passionate and brutal lovemaking. Dennis Hopper is very scary and truly loathsome as a sick man, who can go from one emotional state to the other in a few seconds. MacLachlan is convincing, as 'neighbor' and a guy, who wants to uncover an intrigue all by himself no matter what consequences there might be, and in the process is involved in two affairs, one complex and weighty, second childish and ironically simple.All in all, Blue Velvet has its purpose and in the final evaluation comes as a deeply perturbing, and even confounding, movie, showing a sad and perfectly realistic story about criminal undergrounds that are able to hide somewhere in the seemingly quiet American communities. With some of the very memorable scenes, it is still a considerable film and one of the finest pieces of work by David Lynch.

I was only 5 when this hit theaters but I do remember watching this many times on videotape. Anyway, I'm here to give the new revised review of this amazing film. Looking back at the batman movies, this one comes off as rather unique. Its not your atypical comic book movie in that it doesn't just have loads of action with one fight scene after another. not that it doesn't have its fair share of exciting action scenes, but its more about the characters and how they relate to each other, almost like little character studies. there's a reason why the tagline for the movie is the bat, the cat, the penguin. the movie is all about these 3 characters. One thing that strikes me is the emotional level this film achieves. Its quite amazing what Burton did with the characters, particularly the 2 villains. In the comic books, they are very 2-dimensional characters. Catwoman is just a hot chick who likes to steal things, and Penguin is just a little roly poly guy who wears a tux. If there were ever 2 characters that were in dire need of a face lift, its these 2. Tim Burton gives them both a rather incredible amount of depth and pathos. Penguin is a deformed guy who years after being dumped in the sewer, seeks revenge not only against Gotham city, but more specifically, its children. Talk about a disturbed individual. Catwoman on the other hand was a quiet put upon woman treated badly by her employer, who eventually tries to kill her. This makes her go into a fit of rage, a sequence in which Selina totally lets loose in her apartment, which is quite a powerful scene and which also shows why I love Michelle pfeiffer. Very, very talented actress. Its in this moment she becomes cat woman. Sure beats the hell out of the comics version. Then there is Batman, once again dark and brooding Michael Keaton, born to play this part, who has seemingly no life beyond waiting for that big bat in the sky to call him to duty. During the course of the movie, all these characters go in and out of each others lives, betray each other, love each other, fight each other. The 3 leads are superb together, and the casting for this movie is PERFECT. I mean cmon, who else could possibly play the Penguin? Seriously? But besides the action scenes and the amazing visuals that Burton does so well, there is something about this movie, a kind of sad feeling, especially during the climax. These aren't just your typical run of the mill comic book villains and heroes. These are deeply hurt, deeply scarred people who inhabit this dark wonderland of Gotham city. The penguin acts and behaves like your usual crazy super villain, but at the same time you realize, why is he targeting little kids as his aim of his revenge? Because he himself was thrown into the sewer as a small child and now wants to reenact this on the children of Gotham. Hes hurting. Catwoman and Batman are both messed up which makes them perfect for each other, but they can never truly be together because of the very things that draw them together. The ballroom scene between Selina and Bruce is one of the best scenes in the movie. What can I say, Tim Burton is a master of visuals, a true genius of dark filmmaking. Such is his talent of creating an amazing and creepy atmosphere. He is, as far as I'm concerned, the only guy fit to direct a batman movie. He just gets it. The nerds and basment dwellers who judge a movie simply on how accurate it is to the source material are just narrow minded haters, especially since its popular right now to hate on the older films in order to prop up the newer movies. the comics by the way, are not the Bible. characters and origins are constantly changing and being re-envisioned by different artists writers. one minute penguin is a tux wearing, snooty, intelligent human being, the next hes a monstrous, bulbous, disgusting slob with claws\/flippers and long greasy hair. nothing remains the same for too long in the comics, so when it comes to comic books, nothing in set in concrete. its more up to personal taste, and i believe that burton took the source material and simply added to its greatness. he took the characters and made them so much more compelling then they ever were in the comic books. isn't that what the films are supposed to do?Its really quite sad to see people and the weird crazy internet culture having this massive hard-on for Christopher Nolan's boring, bourgeois bland take on the character. heath ledger did not deserve the Oscar, and was the worst version of joker I've ever seen. Out of all 6 batman films made, none of them I believe have the same kind of raw emotion of this particular batman film. I also like the film also because it deals with outcasts, of which I feel very much an outcast in many ways so I can relate to it. Heck even here on IMDb I am an outcast, as I hate movies that most people seem to love and I love movies people seem to hate! I hate the new Batman's. I think they are dull lifeless garbage. Does that make me Mr. popular or what? But I stick to my thoughts and wont bend just to make some stupid shmoe happy. So there's always this tension with people because my tastes are different. Lets face facts here, most modern versions of thing's suck, and that includes the new batmans. the original 3 are the best, simple as that.

Penguin is a deformed guy who years after being dumped in the sewer, seeks revenge not only against Gotham city, but more specifically, its children. Talk about a disturbed individual. Catwoman on the other hand was a quiet put upon woman treated badly by her employer, who eventually tries to kill her. This makes her go into a fit of rage, a sequence in which Selina totally lets loose in her apartment, which is quite a powerful scene and which also shows why I love Michelle pfeiffer. Very, very talented actress. Its in this moment she becomes cat woman. Sure beats the hell out of the comics version. Then there is Batman, once again dark and brooding Michael Keaton, born to play this part, who has seemingly no life beyond waiting for that big bat in the sky to call him to duty. During the course of the movie, all these characters go in and out of each others lives, betray each other, love each other, fight each other. The 3 leads are superb together, and the casting for this movie is PERFECT. I mean cmon, who else could possibly play the Penguin? Seriously? But besides the action scenes and the amazing visuals that Burton does so well, there is something about this movie, a kind of sad feeling, especially during the climax. These aren't just your typical run of the mill comic book villains and heroes. These are deeply hurt, deeply scarred people who inhabit this dark wonderland of Gotham city. The penguin acts and behaves like your usual crazy super villain, but at the same time you realize, why is he targeting little kids as his aim of his revenge? Because he himself was thrown into the sewer as a small child and now wants to reenact this on the children of Gotham. Hes hurting. Catwoman and Batman are both messed up which makes them perfect for each other, but they can never truly be together because of the very things that draw them together. The ballroom scene between Selina and Bruce is one of the best scenes in the movie. What can I say, Tim Burton is a master of visuals, a true genius of dark filmmaking. Such is his talent of creating an amazing and creepy atmosphere. He is, as far as I'm concerned, the only guy fit to direct a batman movie. He just gets it. The nerds and basment dwellers who judge a movie simply on how accurate it is to the source material are just narrow minded haters, especially since its popular right now to hate on the older films in order to prop up the newer movies. the comics by the way, are not the Bible. characters and origins are constantly changing and being re-envisioned by different artists writers. one minute penguin is a tux wearing, snooty, intelligent human being, the next hes a monstrous, bulbous, disgusting slob with claws\/flippers and long greasy hair. nothing remains the same for too long in the comics, so when it comes to comic books, nothing in set in concrete. its more up to personal taste, and i believe that burton took the source material and simply added to its greatness. he took the characters and made them so much more compelling then they ever were in the comic books. isn't that what the films are supposed to do?Its really quite sad to see people and the weird crazy internet culture having this massive hard-on for Christopher Nolan's boring, bourgeois bland take on the character. heath ledger did not deserve the Oscar, and was the worst version of joker I've ever seen. Out of all 6 batman films made, none of them I believe have the same kind of raw emotion of this particular batman film. I also like the film also because it deals with outcasts, of which I feel very much an outcast in many ways so I can relate to it. Heck even here on IMDb I am an outcast, as I hate movies that most people seem to love and I love movies people seem to hate! I hate the new Batman's. I think they are dull lifeless garbage. Does that make me Mr. popular or what? But I stick to my thoughts and wont bend just to make some stupid shmoe happy. So there's always this tension with people because my tastes are different. Lets face facts here, most modern versions of thing's suck, and that includes the new batmans. the original 3 are the best, simple as that.

He is a discoverer and goes out to meet the Indians, and he meets Pocahontas, the daughter of the chief Powhatan who is seen as a warrior and not an old man. The Europeans are shown a little bit more realistically than usual and they use row-boats to go up and down the river, not Indian canoes, like in most other versions.Pocahontas is shown as a young woman and not a girl, who is adventurous in her own way though at first distant and even fearful. But she accepts contact rather easily and she introduces John Smith to her grand mother Willow, a willow that speaks and gives advice.This meeting of John Smith and Pocahontas is amplified by the meeting of Pocahontas' raccoon and Ratcliffe's pampered dog. This is both charming and funny, how the savage raccoon is so much apter to survive any kind of trouble coming from a civilized dog than the reverse. The third animal here is a humming bird who is the jester of the triad.At this moment Thomas, a young sailor who had followed John on Ratcliffe's order, tries to protect John Smith against Kocoum who had followed Pocahontas, shoots Kocoum dead. Then John Smith, who protects the young chap, is submitted to an ordeal, a path of torture between two lines of Indians hitting him with any bludgeon they may have. He is saved by Pocahontas in extremis. Here the Indian custom is not specified, because of course it is not the case here a woman who has lost family in a battle can claim a prisoner to replace the dead relative. This is the weak point of the film because Pocahontas' claim is not justified from the Indian point of view. That makes Powhatan weak.But the most important part of the film is the showing of the opposition of two cultures, two visions of the world.Powhatan declares These white men are dangerous. No one is to go near them. That's pure fear in front of the thunder sticks, the rifles.But then John Smith explains to Pocahontas what follows. We'll show you people how to use this land properly, how to make the most of it. And he retorts to Pocahontas' objection as follows. You say that because you don't know better. And he calls the Indians savages which causes the retreat of Pocahontas. Then he explains his mind. Savage is just a word, a term for people who are uncivilized. That's burning his boat and then sinking the ashes. Pocahontas conclusion is just to the point. Savages are people who are not like you. And that's when a war starts.The two cultures, Indians and English men, are just the same and they sing the same song about savages, the savages being of course demons on the other side. Powhatan leads the Indian movement as the chief of them when the warriors from other tribes have arrived. Ratcliffe leads the English but for his own narrow-minded, violent, even cruel, and greedy motivations.Grand Mother Willow advises Pocahontas properly, the raccoon brings Jim Smith's compass it had stolen a long time before and that's the dream a spinning arrow showing the way. Pocahontas takes John Smith with her and they go to Powhatan to stop the war just when the two armies are face to face. Powhatan accepts his daughter's demand. My daughter speaks with the wisdom beyond her years. We've all come here with anger in our hearts, but she's come with courage and understanding. From this day if there's to be more killing, it will not start with me. The fool then is Ratcliffe who tries to shoot Powhatan, but John Smith gets in-between and It is John Smith who is shot. He has to go back to England, to be cured and healed, or to die on the ship taking him to England. That ending is a lot better than going back to England to cure and heal severe burns caused by his dumb smoking next to a bag of gun powder.So what's the meaning of the film? Definitely a call for wisdom in the relations between ethnic groups, a total evacuation of the invasion of Indian territory by Europeans, a discrete allusion to the genocide that was to come later on, a total absence of real commerce between the English and the Indians, the fact that the Europeans do not seem keen on starting survival activities like cultivating the land or hunting properly.The film is in fact entirely transferred from the historical point of view to the sentimental point of view, as a metaphor of the ethnic situation.When John Smith falls in love with Pocahontas and is a prisoner destined to be brained alive or rather brained dead on the following morning he tells Pocahontas No matter what happens to me, I will always be with you, forever. And when John Smith is being taken to his ship, Pocahontas says No matter what happens to me, I will always be with you, forever.

Eight years later, an impostor named Arnaud du Tilh arrived in Artigat falsely claiming to be Martin. Although he was accepted as such by Guerre's wife Bertrande and his family, rumours began to spread about his identity, and he was eventually exposed when the true Martin Guerre returned to the village. A number of writers and film-makers have taken inspiration from these events, including Daniel Vigne, the director of Le Retour de Martin Guerre from 1982. Sommersby is sometimes regarded as a remake of Vigne's drama, but it might more accurately be described as being loosely inspired by the real historical events upon which the other was much more closely based. Jon Amiel transfers the action to the American South, immediately after the American Civil War. Jack Sommersby, is a landowner who left his farm to fight in the war. Nothing further has been heard from him, and everyone, including his wife Laurel, presumes that he is dead. Nobody, including Laurel, is particularly worried by this; Jack was an unpleasant individual, an abusive husband and a neglectful father to his young son Robert. Laurel is even planning to marry a neighbour named Orin Meacham. And then one day a man returns, claiming to be Jack. Yet, although he closely resembles Jack Sommersby physically, he is quite different in personality. He is kind and loving to Laurel and Robert and tries to help his poorer neighbours by selling parts of his farm to them. He is also a shrewd businessman, as evidenced by his scheme to revive the local economy by growing tobacco. He explains this change in his character by saying War changes you; makes you appreciate things. The only people unhappy about Sommersby's return are Orin, whose plans to marry Laurel have been dashed, and racist Confederate veterans who resent the fact that Jack is trying to help former slaves as well as his white neighbours. Orin begins to suspect that the newcomer is in fact an impostor. (Which indeed he is). I am surprised that Sommersby has such a low rating on this board (currently only 5.9) and that it has been criticised so fiercely. One of the grounds of criticism has been the cultural snobbery of those, on both sides of the Atlantic, who assume that any Hollywood remake of a European film is bound to be a vastly inferior copy of the original. Yet, although Vigne's film is undoubtedly a good one, I think that Amiel's can stand comparison with it. There are, moreover, important differences between the two films. The real Martin Guerre appears in the film that bears his name, whereas here we never see the real Jack Sommersby. (We learn that he did indeed die in the war). Both impostors are placed on trial for their lives, but for different reasons. Du Tilh is tried for his own crime, that of impersonating Martin. (Adultery and fraud were capital offences in the France of that period). The false Sommersby, a former schoolmaster named Horace Townsend, is not tried for anything he has done himself, although there are plenty of murky episodes in his past, quite apart from the question of criminal impersonation. He is tried for a murder committed by the man whose identity he has stolen. There is no doubt that Sommersby was the killer, so the only way Townsend can save his neck is to admit his deceit and prove his true identity. Yet this is something he is strangely reluctant to do. Richard Gere can at times seem too laid-back, especially in comedies and lighter films. Yet when he is given more demanding roles, he is often capable of rising to the challenge, especially in films like The Honorary Consul and Primal Fear, and Sommersby must count as one of his best performances, as Townsend is a very complex character. He is a man with a shady past who commits what is, to all intents and purposes, a criminal deception, yet who does for idealistic reasons, reasons for which he is prepared to lay down his life. To highlight all the varying facets of Townsend's character, while making him appear both believable and sympathetic, was a difficult task, but one in which Gere succeeded very well.Jodie Foster is equally good as Laurel, a woman torn between the need to believe that the man with whom she has fallen in love really is her long-lost husband miraculously changed for the better and the fear that her new-found happiness may in fact be based on a lie. This was one of a number of stellar performances in the late eighties and early nineties- others include The Accused, The Silence of the Lambs and Nell which established her as the most exciting young actress of the period. There is also a good contribution from Bill Pullman as Orin, a man torn by jealousy and resentment and yet not wholly bad. Visually, the film is much darker than Le Retour de Martin Guerre, which seemed to be suffused by a rich, warm light. Apart from the green of the vegetation, it is dominated by dull tones, particularly greys and browns, perhaps appropriate for a film which takes place in a country torn by civil war. It seemed to me that Amiel was taking the theme of the earlier film and using it to explore America's own history, as well as some dark areas of human psychology, the philosophical issues surrounding personal identity and the question of atonement for past sins. Indeed, it perhaps goes more deeply into these issues than did Vigne's film which did not, for example, explore deeply the reasons why du Tilh decided to steal another man's identity. If this is a remake, it is one which deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as its predecessor. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"29 June 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" In 1548 a young man named Martin Guerre disappeared from the southern French village of Artigat.

Apart from the green of the vegetation, it is dominated by dull tones, particularly greys and browns, perhaps appropriate for a film which takes place in a country torn by civil war. It seemed to me that Amiel was taking the theme of the earlier film and using it to explore America's own history, as well as some dark areas of human psychology, the philosophical issues surrounding personal identity and the question of atonement for past sins. Indeed, it perhaps goes more deeply into these issues than did Vigne's film which did not, for example, explore deeply the reasons why du Tilh decided to steal another man's identity. If this is a remake, it is one which deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as its predecessor. 9\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Romance"},{"date":"29 June 2012","score":"","review":" Everyone has their own personal Golden Age roughly corresponding to when they were about eight to twelve years old.

So I recall it was with some degree of anticipation that I awaited the first big screen incarnation of Superman as an adult, and although there were minor inconsistencies with the Superman canon that I picked up on while viewing the film, overall I thought the picture did justice to the iconic super hero. Probably the main thing that bothered me was seeing that big old 'S' on Marlon Brando's chest during the early scenes on the planet Krypton. There really was no justification for that and the picture didn't try to offer any, but it managed to distract me big time whenever Brando was on screen.What the film does real well is interject a kind of whimsy to the idea of a super hero, the kind of character we all envision ourselves to be when left to daydreaming about having super strength or the ability to fly. I know I donned a bath towel around my neck more than once in my youth, realizing full well that I was no match for the law of gravity. Funny how you remember things like that when revisiting old friends like Superman, Batman and Green Lantern; those would have been my favorites from back in the day.Watching the movie today gave me a different kind of perspective that comes from reviewing films on this forum. For example, there's a scene in a train station where one of the destinations called out happens to be Poughkeepsie. Since Gene Hackman appears in the story as Superman's arch-foe Lex Luthor, I had to wonder if that was a subtle tribute to 1971's The French Connection, in which Hackman's character, a New York City cop, asks a street thug if he ever picked his toes in Poughkeepsie. Then of course there's that quick glimpse of New York's Twin Towers (at 13648) of the World Trade Center serving as a stark reminder of the horror visited upon America on 9\/11.I guess by today's standards, the special effects of this movie aren't that big a deal, but they're impressive enough in their own way. I particularly liked the way the opening scene established The Phantom Zone as an eternal prison for inhumane criminals, and the formation of the Fortress of Solitude in almost direct contrast to the destruction of Krypton. It was cool to see those elements from the comic books brought to life along with the reversal of time concept I recall from some story I read as a kid.

Eight years later, a man arrived in Artigat claiming to be Martin. He was accepted as such by Guerre's wife Bertrande and family, and lived with Bertrande as her husband for three years, although some villagers entertained doubts about his identity. Rumours, encouraged by Guerre's uncle Pierre who was involved in a property dispute with his supposed nephew, began to spread that this Martin was in fact an impostor. He was arrested and placed on trial, but his intimate knowledge of Guerre's past life and the support he still enjoyed from many villagers seemed likely to secure his acquittal. During the trial, however, there was a dramatic development; another man turned up claiming to be Martin Guerre. It was quickly established that the newcomer was indeed the true Martin and that the impostor was in reality a man from a neighbouring village named Arnaud du Tilh. Du Tilh was convicted and subsequently hanged, adultery and fraud being capital offences in the France of this period. A number of writers and film-makers have taken inspiration from these events, Whereas the later American film Sommersby tells a fictitious tale loosely based upon the story of Martin Guerre, transferring the action to nineteenth-century Virginia, Daniel Vigne's film is a reasonably accurate version of the historical events, aiming at a reconstruction of 16th century French peasant life. The main role, that of du Tilh, is taken by Gérard Depardieu, possibly France's finest modern screen actor. His attempts to conquer Hollywood have not been very successful, but I have never seen him give a poor performance in his native language, and this is a fine one, playing his character as a plausible and at times almost likable rogue. He is particularly good in the electrifying trial scene. Whatever else du Tilh may have been, he was clearly a consummate actor, and Depardieu's impassioned speeches reflect his character's knowledge that he needs to give the performance of his life, as that life now depends upon his acting skills. Just as it seems that du Tilh has succeeded in his imposture, Vigne interrupts the proceedings with a brilliant coup de cinema; the sight of a man with a wooden leg entering the courtroom. Or rather the sight of the wooden leg itself- the angle from which the scene is shot means that we see this before we see the man's face. (We have heard it suggested that the newcomer cannot be Martin Guerre because the real Martin, after leaving the village, joined the army and lost a leg in battle). Other acting fine contributions come from Roger Planchon as Jean de Coras, the humane and sceptical lawyer in charge of the investigation, and Nathalie Baye as Bertrande, a young woman placed in a difficult situation by the return of her supposed husband. It is implied that Bertrande, despite her doubts, welcomed du Tilh into her bed because he was both a better lover and a more considerate husband than the departed Martin, who seems to have been deficient in both departments. I would, perhaps, have welcomed a greater exploration of why du Tilh might have tried to claim another man's identity, although Vigne possibly wanted to create a sense of mystery by keeping alive as long as possible the thought that Depardieu's character might actually be the real Martin. Vigne makes use of few bright colours other than the green of the vegetation and the red of the judges' robes during the trial; in the days before chemical dyestuffs bright colours did not play a large part in the lives of the peasantry. Visually, however, the film is suffused with a warmth of tone reminiscent of an Old master painting; I was particularly put in mind of the works of Breughel and Georges de la Tour celebrating peasant life. It is sometime said that the British are obsessed with the glories of their past, and that in the cinema this is reflected by the large number of films made on a historical theme.

And being aware of what we are stimulates the idea of our self-improvement as long as we keep aware of what we are not, and maybe the most important, what we can't and will never be. And the line between the incapability of this admittance and a low self-esteem is unfortunately, extremely thin.And The Nutty Professor is a wonderful comedy for its positive and insightful message about self-acceptance through a very sympathetic protagonist, Eddie Murphy as Professor Sherman Klump. Murphy perfectly diluted all his flamboyance and sometimes obnoxious flashiness in a sweet, gentle and likable character whose occupation besides teaching in college is to make DNA experiences on hamsters in order to find some medical solutions against obesity. Yet obesity doesn't seem to be an issue in his own life, not until he meets Carla Purty, his new colleague, played by the eye-pleasing Jada Pinckett Smith. Naturally, he falls in love, and we realize that we just meet Klump at a pivotal moment of his life, obesity became an issue.Tone-wise, Tom Shaydac's film finds the right balance between humor and sweetness. In one of the most hilarious cinematic family dinners, we meet the Klumps, a sight that works as a genetic alibi for Sherman's appearance. Eddie Murphy, who proved his chameleonic talent in such films as Coming to America is at the top of his game in The Nutty Professor where he's both a sweet and caring mother, a naughty Black mama, a mean-spirited blue-collar father, a superficial brother and Sherman Klump (the other character played by Murphy isn't featured in the scene, but you'd hardly recognize him as an Aerobic coach). The film, that won the Oscar for Best Make-Up, is the greatest credit to Murphy's talent when it comes to portray various characters.But there's more than discussions about weight and some farting contest in that dinner (always hilarious and never vulgar), the scene concludes with a beautiful exchange between Sherman and his mother. She loves him like any other mother, she sees both an inner and a physical beauty and we don't laugh at that. Whether he believed her or not is not the point, we can only sympathize with this good man, who wants this inner beauty to express itself. And when in the next scene, he asks Carla for a date, we understand Mama Klump found the right words to encourage her son to overcome his shyness. Carla is not indifferent to Sherman and accepts the date unaware that it would lead to a disaster because the restaurant stars a stand-up comedian who roasts people in the audience.Maybe I should have mentioned that the film is the remake of a Jerry Lewis' classic, but I don't think it's necessary since I know both stories are different. And I don't even think, the original is better just because it's the first one. All I know is I can more relate to a nerdy scientist who wants to be accepted by society than one who just wants to be a womanizer. Like so many great comedies like Groundhog Day or Planes, Trains and Automobiles, there is a heart in The Nutty Professor and Eddie Murphy's so powerful that I could feel the way he felt. When everybody was getting their share of mocking jokes, he knew his turn was coming, and he would have it pretty bad (Dave Chappelle did a great job as the mean-spirited Reggie by the way), so when he tries to go to the toilet but unfortunately finds himself in the spotlight, we know the worst is to come.Murphy is so good in that role that it was impossible for me to laugh at Reggie's jokes; I could feel Sherman's broken heart, the devastation not just from the jokes, but from the people's reactions. The following scene is almost a tear-jerker when Carla tries to console him, he hardly speaks, the man was victim of a bullying that was the culmination of all the violence he tacitly endured. This is the pivotal moment where he decides to test his own researches on himself and become Buddy Love, a sort of Alpha Male who's got every thing a man can wish. Basically, Buddy Love is Eddie Murphy playing Eddie Murphy in the most irritating way, I missed Sherman Klump as soon as he disappeared but I forgive Buddy Love, if only for the magnificent revenge against Reggie, where the sprinkler became the sprinkled.Now, is the personality of Buddy Love irritating? I think it's the perfect representation of the way we indirectly perceive ourselves, since Sherman has low self-esteem, Buddy has exceedingly high self-esteem, it's his strength, his attitude almost embodies the whole 'Macho Man' theme song. Eddie Murphy mocks his own character as if he was aware that sometimes, being over confident can flirt with mean spiritedness, and he's so 'himself' that he manages to make us appreciate Sherman even more and this is the film's greatest message. I &#x96;myself- had some issues with my appearance, and used to tell myself that I would be the most confident guy in the world if I had glasses, or if I were a few inches taller, but the meaning of our lives is not to wait for physical criteria to be confident and certainly not to compare ourselves to others, because that's the negation of our own specificity, and our capacity to contribute to the world on our own.The climactic speech is something I could respond to, it's the beautiful coming to realization of a man who didn't value himself enough while he had all the reasons to.

Using a cast of mostly unknowns, Kubrick sets up the plot simply through the hero, Frank Silvera, letting the audience in on the fact that he is in trouble, and that he isn't capable of a rational decision because of his predicament. Through flashback, the audience sees his story, a prizefighter who isn't going anywhere, and a Times Square dance hall hostess (Irene Kane) who has fallen on rough times, obsessed with a mixed up childhood thanks to an unloving father, a more talented sister, and a mother who died on the day she was born. These are two screwed up people living in the Naked City who decide to escape it but face opposition from one of Kane's criminal dance partners who realizes that she knows too much about his activities. Remain patient with the convoluted first 20 minutes of the film (which features a flashback within the flashback) and just wait for the second half to explode into a chase downtown near the Fulton Street fish market. Even more gripping is a fight between the hero and villain in a warehouse (involving unclothed mannequins), which is powerful stuff. Downtown Manhattan has never looked so empty and spooky. The filming is rough, the editing sketchy, but somehow it all comes off. Silvera is a great non-traditional movie hero, and Kane a bewitching femme fatal that will keep you guessing as to whose side she is on.

Doctor Zhivago is the story of a physician and poet named Yuri Zhivago. It chronicles the love affair he had with a girl named Lara, even thought both of them were already married. It's a passionate tale of love and lust all set against the backdrop of the Bolshevik Revolution and it follows the revolution and the hardships Zhivago must endure during it.Doctor Zhivago highlights a very specific type of film, the grand epic. It has massive and illustrious sets, beautiful sweeping vistas of a variety of different locations all around Europe, hundreds upon hundreds of extras, a powerful and passionate score, and it clocks in at three hours and twenty minutes. All these things are what make up any good epic, and Doctor Zhivago is a film that is proud to have all these elements. But it's also proud to tell a moving and romantic story that takes place over many years and introduces a cavalcade of characters throughout its far reaching story. Even if you don't particularly like the film itself, nobody can deny credit to such an enormous production.My only problems with Doctor Zhivago are out of personal taste. I'm not a huge fan of epics as I like smaller and more intimate films more. I'm not a huge fan of romances as it's simply not my cup of tea. And I'm also not a huge fan of films that are over three hours long. I make a lot of exceptions to this one but not so much in the case of Doctor Zhivago. I'm also not much of a history buff so the historically relevant plot that unfolds here amidst the Bolshevik Revolution doesn't do a whole lot for me either.However, there's no way that I won't say Doctor Zhivago isn't a film of a pristine quality and the time and effort that went into making this film is more than commendable. If epics, romances, or history is your thing then you will probably love Doctor Zhivago. If not then you might want to sit this one out unless you really care about seeing it.

I can tell you that it is quite authentic and based on a true happening. Now I have never heard of any head spinning or anything of that sort. Just cursing, spitting, beds moving, Ouija boards, words being scratched on skin etc...I was lucky enough to have seen this with my priest\/uncle who after-wards had to use the toilet and I asked if he would bless it and he quipped, I don't know about that, but I can baptize it LOLLAnyway so back to the movie. INTENSE DRAMA! NOT really a HORROR movie. Yes the effects have aged and look cheap in some parts, but the effect of the undercurrent is stunning! The story telling and acting alone makes this movie soar to the highest of realms. Absolute perfect pacing, though some people have remarked that the beginning is slow yet I find it as haunting as the rest- clocks stopping, rapid dogs fighting, a mysterious Jesuit medal found in an archaeological dig, then the statue of Pezuzu. The score mostly by Penderecki, while not meant to be scary, is unbelievably so. Just everything down to it's minutest detail is just perfect. Just one example is when Chris MacNeil is walking freely down the street to her home in Georgetown and passes some nuns with their robes billowing in the October breeze, which we now know is Halloween when tiny trick or treaters run past her. It is these subtle images that really bring this movie home. It isn't about being scared in the middle of the night or 3 a.m. it is the devil at all hours.Now Regan goes through all the shenanigans that modern science would put anyone through if they were acting this way even in the 21st Century where everyone with any hint of spiritual\/emotional crisis is put on pills if they are deemed problematic.

Even though it uses special effects they are not too obvious, making the film more realistic. The cast in this are amazing and play their roles very well especially Tobey Maguire who is really having to play two different people as he is showing two opposite sides to one person, he brings emotion and energy to this film and is the perfect person for the job; playing a nerdy teenager who doesn't particularly fit in at school and also playing a brave hero. This film is one that you can watch many times and still enjoy the story and action and is a great start to the next films that follow. It's a good film which is definitely worth watching!

A lot of it was random and didn't make sense. For example, at the end, when Justin Long's eyes have been eaten out, you can see that his body has been hollowed out.If that were the case, he wouldn't have been screaming ten seconds ago, and his body would not stand up. Also, what is the significance of the song Jeepers Creepers? Another question The Creeper could see through the entire movie, so why did he eat Justin Long's eyes? I have been told that you get answers in the 2nd one, but the first was so awful that I likely will not watch them.

Usually overlooked on Meryl Streep's Filmography. A terrific screenplay. A brilliant supporting cast Rip Torn, Lee Grant, Buck Henry, Shirley MacLaine (as the curator of past lives). It starts out a little slow, but stay with it. Daniel Miller has to die for the action to begin Daniel pays more attention to his music than his driving and gets hit by a bus. (No gore, however.) In the next scene, he is on another bus heading for Judgement City to defend his life and all the fears that us little brains have. Is this Heaven? No. But some of your new little mini-malls come close. While in Judgement City you can eat all you want without gaining weight and the food is fast, fresh and delicious. Where is Judgement City? High above the Earth where we all expect Heaven to be. If Daniel wins his case by defending the decisions he made in his life, he gets to move on to the next higher level of existence. If he loses, he gets sent back to Earth to try again. Rip Torn plays his defender, Bob Diamond. Meryl Streep plays his love interest, Julia, who had the perfect life until she tripped on the patio furniture, hit her head, and fell into a backyard pool. (I shouldn't have died, I was a terrific swimmer.) I rank it up there with other all-time fantasies such as Here Comes Mr. Jordan,Heaven Can Wait and Oh, God!. Far from perfect movies, but compelling to watch with a haunting quality. Apparently, many of the reviewers who didn't like it failed to understand it. Judgement City is not Purgatory!

There are the parents, 4 daughters, 1 son, the grandfather, and the family maid (hilariously played by Marjorie Main). We watch the Smith family throughout their adventures the two eldest daughters have romances, and the youngest two go through childhood traditions such as Halloween. But then, the father gets a job in New York, which threatens the family's peaceful existence in St. Louis. Fortunately, everything turns out for the better, and the family heads out to the World's Fair.One interesting point to this film is that the plot is relatively simple. This allows for multiple opportunities for the family to be developed. This film had multiple problems in its production multiple scripts with rather silly plot points, and the majority of the cast took sick at one point or another. The fact that this film turned out as well as it did is a miracle, for none of the problems showed up on screen. What makes the film work is the relationship between the family members. Everyone looks like they could have been a real family at one point, thanks to Vincente Minnelli's superb direction. Although all the performances are excellent, the two standouts are the adorable Margaret O'Brien and the one and only Judy Garland. O'Brien naturally steals every scene, and Garland proves why she was (and still is) the beloved performer she is today, with that marvelous voice and expressive face. Another standout to the production is George Folsey's warm Technicolor cinematography, which captures the lushness of the sets and Irene Sharaff's costumes (Minnelli films depend on their visuals). Let's not forget those songs, which make this film the classic it is today (The Trolley Song and Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, among others). Quaint and simple fun.

I say that because the movie is purposefully dumb, but also just dumb dumb. It's the directorial debut of the Farrelly brothers who have gone on to create such comedic masterpieces as Stuck on You and Shallow Hal. Really, when you're going into a Farrelly brother movie you know what to expect. It's going to be stupid, but it might be good for a laugh or two. You can't expect much and you shouldn't plan on having the time of your life watching any of their movies.But I digress. Dumb and Dumber is the film that began their career and it stars Jim Carey and Jeff Daniels and Lloyd and Harry, respectively. They're two idiot best friends who drive across the country to return a briefcase to somebody that Lloyd met while working as a limo driver. They get themselves into a lot of trouble as soon as they pick up that briefcase, however, and end up getting a lot more than they bargained for during their misadventures across America.Dumb and Dumber is a comedy that is well aware of its own stupidity, and that's where it garners all of its laughs from, being completely brain dead. It's littered with poop and fart jokes, with a few intelligent quips thrown in here and there. It's story is all over the place and is incredibly convoluted for such a simple buddy comedy movie.Honestly, the script here doesn't have a whole lot to offer, but Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are very funny together. They throw in a lot of their own humor and make the characters of Lloyd and Harry worthwhile. After reading a little bit I learned that some of the film's funniest moments were improvised by Carrey and Daniels which is ironically hilarious, but it makes the film itself that much worse.But, again, I can't be too harsh on this film. It's just another stupid comedy that has nothing more to offer than, as I said before, a laugh or two. In fact, I actually sort of enjoyed Dumb and Dumber. This brand of comedy isn't my thing but the movie entertained. However, it has the most pathetically thrown together and ridiculously abrupt ending I've ever seen in a comedy, and this really left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I was actually close to saying this was a pretty good film, but after it's awful ending I'm going to have to go with pretty bad instead.
