Several years later I became a Coen Bros fan and tried again. What an incredible movie! It's not up to their current standards, but the raw talent and trademark absorption with the seamy side of humanity are all there. The first time I watched it I knew it was a black comedy, but was having trouble isolating what was funny about it. The third viewing told me this is a deadly serious movie whose plot is a screwball comedy; misidentification, misunderstandings, all the stuff that made A Comedy of Errors funny are in this movie. This subtlety gives the movie its creepy power.I noticed some viewers have real trouble with the ugliness, and I have to say that I don't usually like books or movies where I can't identify with any of the characters, but the Coens are an exception. Many of their movies have the theme of stupid people doing stupid things that they think will change their lives for the better, resulting in catastrophe and the need for more stupidity and violence to try and dig themselves out of a steadily worsening situation. It's like watching a slow-motion train wreck, and I need to be in the mood for it, but nobody does it better.(When I read the book A Simple Plan, I DESPERATELY wanted the Coens to film it. Sam Raimi would have been my second choice, I guess, but after seeing it I STILL wish the Coens had done it.) While this movie may be better appreciated by current Coen fans than newcomers, it's well worth the watching.

In this film, we see not only one, but three 3-dimensional characters, brilliantly played out by Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, and Greg Kinnear.Most viewers agree the actors are brilliant in this movie, but some seem to be doubtful about James L. Brooks' direction and screenplay, which is funny since the actors' performances are linked with the director's direction in substantial degree.   Nicholson and Hunt thanked Brooks' direction in their Oscar Award  speeches.As to the screenplay, there seem to have a few viewers who didn't get Helen Hunt's character (Carol) -- how she could possibly love Nicholson's obnoxious character (Melvin), and why she changes her mind so often.    It's unfortunate those viewers neglect some setups and subplots in the film that clearly explain them -- In the beginning, Carol is only nice to Melvin as she treats everybody so.  She is, however, trying to find a man to help support her family; this is shown in the scene where her date leaves her after her ill son's vomit spoils his mood -- as he leaves, he says to her I'm sorry, but that's too much reality for a Friday night. At a time when Carol is most stressed out by her son's illness, Melvin is the only one who offers help, out of a simple need -- he just needs Carol back to the restaurant to wait on him, since he and all other waitresses don't get along. Melvin's help, however, means world to Carol, although at first she still tells Melvin that if he's trying to sleep with her (by helping her son), he can just forget about it. Knowing Melvin has special feeling for her, Carol has a big inner conflict, as shown in the scene in which she tries to write a thank you note for him, and fusses over the word CONSCIENCE as CON - SCIENCE. -- Subconsciously, she feels that she may be exploiting him (treating him better in return for his help). On the flip side, Melvin may be exploiting her (helping her son in order to get closer to her).Throughout the film, Carol has been irritated or angered by Melvin's obnoxious foul mouth several times, but every time she returns home, she would change her mind and gives Melvin another chance.   Some people didn't get this, but it's quite simple and logical -- every time she returns home and sees her son, she thinks of Melvin as THE person who offers help in time of needs.   To her, there is that positive traits in Melvin that she can appreciate.As to Melvin's character, he lives in his own very stiff world, and would only deal with the few people he likes (in this film, that's only Carol).   His foul mouth is his way to shut out the people he doesn't want to spend time with -- and that's almost everybody, since he feels safe living only in his own world, and paranoid on things and people outside of his apartment.   This is shown in his compulsive behaviors of washing hands excessively and locking the door repetitively.   However, once he spends time with others ( forced or otherwise), he CAN learn to get along with and appreciate them.   In this film, it's the dog and Simon.  Again, he is not a bad person, just a man who wants to be left alone.   His foul mouth is his defense mechanism, which roots so deep that he can't even control it around the only person he likes.In short, this is one of the most brilliant scripts with intriguing characters and a brilliant story.

In this film, we see not only one, but three 3-dimensional characters, brilliantly played out by Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, and Greg Kinnear.Most viewers agree the actors are brilliant in this movie, but some seem to be doubtful about James L. Brooks' direction and screenplay, which is funny since the actors' performances are linked with the director's direction in substantial degree.   Nicholson and Hunt thanked Brooks' direction in their Oscar Award  speeches.As to the screenplay, there seem to have a few viewers who didn't get Helen Hunt's character (Carol) -- how she could possibly love Nicholson's obnoxious character (Melvin), and why she changes her mind so often.    It's unfortunate those viewers neglect some setups and subplots in the film that clearly explain them -- In the beginning, Carol is only nice to Melvin as she treats everybody so.  She is, however, trying to find a man to help support her family; this is shown in the scene where her date leaves her after her ill son's vomit spoils his mood -- as he leaves, he says to her I'm sorry, but that's too much reality for a Friday night. At a time when Carol is most stressed out by her son's illness, Melvin is the only one who offers help, out of a simple need -- he just needs Carol back to the restaurant to wait on him, since he and all other waitresses don't get along. Melvin's help, however, means world to Carol, although at first she still tells Melvin that if he's trying to sleep with her (by helping her son), he can just forget about it. Knowing Melvin has special feeling for her, Carol has a big inner conflict, as shown in the scene in which she tries to write a thank you note for him, and fusses over the word CONSCIENCE as CON - SCIENCE. -- Subconsciously, she feels that she may be exploiting him (treating him better in return for his help). On the flip side, Melvin may be exploiting her (helping her son in order to get closer to her).Throughout the film, Carol has been irritated or angered by Melvin's obnoxious foul mouth several times, but every time she returns home, she would change her mind and gives Melvin another chance.   Some people didn't get this, but it's quite simple and logical -- every time she returns home and sees her son, she thinks of Melvin as THE person who offers help in time of needs.   To her, there is that positive traits in Melvin that she can appreciate.As to Melvin's character, he lives in his own very stiff world, and would only deal with the few people he likes (in this film, that's only Carol).   His foul mouth is his way to shut out the people he doesn't want to spend time with -- and that's almost everybody, since he feels safe living only in his own world, and paranoid on things and people outside of his apartment.   This is shown in his compulsive behaviors of washing hands excessively and locking the door repetitively.   However, once he spends time with others ( forced or otherwise), he CAN learn to get along with and appreciate them.   In this film, it's the dog and Simon.  Again, he is not a bad person, just a man who wants to be left alone.   His foul mouth is his defense mechanism, which roots so deep that he can't even control it around the only person he likes.In short, this is one of the most brilliant scripts with intriguing characters and a brilliant story.   AS GOOD AS IT GETS is the best character-driven dramatic comedy in years. . .  9 out of 10  . .

The great thing about this title is it sets up the film perfectly--it's a parody, and a surprisingly entertaining and hilarious and fun one, too.David Arquette is the film's main character the local boy who has returned after 10 years and still has a crush on cute Sheriff Sam Parker (Kari Wuhrer). Once he arrives, he tries to spark a relationship with her, but everything is put on hold when mutated spiders (which formed from pollution in the mining caves) start to attack humans and animals, and everything goes haywire. Now David's character must put an end to these eight legged freaks before all legs break loose. (Yeah, that was a pretty bad pun.)Eight Legged Freaks was one of the biggest surprises of last year, mainly because it was so darn funny and such a good spoof. I went into the theater expecting, at the bare minimum, a film with a rating of...say...2, 2.5\/5 stars. I'd have to give this a 3.5. It was completely overlooked, probably the most overlooked film of last year (though that is pushing it). The parody is classic.Do you remember those old films about mining towns in the middle of nowhere, population 9, where giant grasshoppers, spiders, worms--heck, I saw a film with giant ants once--start attacking? That's what Eight Legged Freaks spoofs. It takes the old formulas and twists it around to have fun with.Towards the end I found myself having such a pleasurable experience that I couldn't believe this film was so underrated. Nothing is more fun than seeing a bunch of people going after giant spiders with shotguns--it's pure fun. The people that went into this film expecting Oscar material were nuts.The most sad thing about Eight Legged Freaks is that the people going into Men in Black II were probably expecting something like this something funny, smart, original, witty, and satirical. I went into Men in Black II expecting something as good as Eight Legged Freaks, and apparently Roger Ebert did, too. I'm on the same level with him, because I thought this film was extremely entertaining. There are some plot holes and stupid cliches, but most of them are there to be made fun of. People going into deserted malls late at night trying to escape the spiders, people going into the lair of the spiders (which ends in them being chased by a giant Black Widow Spider). Y'know those movies where people do things, and you hear people in the movie theater (maybe it's you) shouting, Don't go in there! It'll get you!? That's what Eight Legged Freaks plays on. Basically this film makes fun of every misused B-monster movie cliche, and that's what is so darn funny about this movie.This film delivered everything I go to the movies for.3.5\/5 stars -John Ulmer ","genre":"Action, Comedy, Horror"},{"date":"16 April 2003","score":"59 out of 73 people found the following review useful","review":"  Eight Legged Freaks was originally titled Arac Attack before the film's star, David Arquette, thought of a better title (Eight Legged Freaks).

It takes the old formulas and twists it around to have fun with.Towards the end I found myself having such a pleasurable experience that I couldn't believe this film was so underrated. Nothing is more fun than seeing a bunch of people going after giant spiders with shotguns--it's pure fun. The people that went into this film expecting Oscar material were nuts.The most sad thing about Eight Legged Freaks is that the people going into Men in Black II were probably expecting something like this something funny, smart, original, witty, and satirical. I went into Men in Black II expecting something as good as Eight Legged Freaks, and apparently Roger Ebert did, too. I'm on the same level with him, because I thought this film was extremely entertaining. There are some plot holes and stupid cliches, but most of them are there to be made fun of. People going into deserted malls late at night trying to escape the spiders, people going into the lair of the spiders (which ends in them being chased by a giant Black Widow Spider). Y'know those movies where people do things, and you hear people in the movie theater (maybe it's you) shouting, Don't go in there! It'll get you!? That's what Eight Legged Freaks plays on. Basically this film makes fun of every misused B-monster movie cliche, and that's what is so darn funny about this movie.This film delivered everything I go to the movies for.3.5\/5 stars -John Ulmer ","genre":null},{"date":"16 April 2003","score":"59 out of 73 people found the following review useful","review":"  Eight Legged Freaks was originally titled Arac Attack before the film's star, David Arquette, thought of a better title (Eight Legged Freaks). The great thing about this title is it sets up the film perfectly--it's a parody, and a surprisingly entertaining and hilarious and fun one, too.David Arquette is the film's main character the local boy who has returned after 10 years and still has a crush on cute Sheriff Sam Parker (Kari Wuhrer). Once he arrives, he tries to spark a relationship with her, but everything is put on hold when mutated spiders (which formed from pollution in the mining caves) start to attack humans and animals, and everything goes haywire. Now David's character must put an end to these eight legged freaks before all legs break loose. (Yeah, that was a pretty bad pun.)Eight Legged Freaks was one of the biggest surprises of last year, mainly because it was so darn funny and such a good spoof. I went into the theater expecting, at the bare minimum, a film with a rating of...say...2, 2.5\/5 stars. I'd have to give this a 3.5. It was completely overlooked, probably the most overlooked film of last year (though that is pushing it).

Rowling's bestselling novels, about Harry Potter's adventures during his first year at Hogwarts, gets the budding franchise off to one hell of a start and myself finally into the thick of Pottermania after I watched the DVD and raced through all four books last summer. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) become so immersed in their roles, we have to remind ourselves that we're watching actors. The same goes for all the supporting characters, who are too numerous to mention here, because it's impossible to single out only a select few. There's not one bad performance to be seen. Complementing the players are solid direction by Chris Columbus, incredible sets by Stuart Craig and a powerful soundtrack by John Williams. When you think about it, has the man ever really composed a bad score? HP's only flaws are a long introduction and slow second-half pacing. Were it not for the awesome Tomb Raider, the boy wizard would have conjured up the best movie of 2001. Yes, you read that right.The last thing I want to do here is get on my soapbox, but there is one issue regarding this movie that I need to get off my chest. While Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone may not have won any Oscars, it unfortunately does deserve the Complaining About the Color of the Couch Award. (Note the initials.) Never mind that HP earned nearly $1 billion worldwide and is the second-highest grossing film of all time (unfortunately playing second fiddle to the downright horrible Titanic). I don't think I've ever heard so much anally-retentive griping before over one single movie. For instance, considering the universal disdain for tie-in merchandising, Columbus caught holy hell for staunchly rejecting any Harry Potter fast-food tie-ins - at Rowling's request, no less! - while Burger King got away unscathed with their Lord of the Rings promotion. Go figure.And to those who just can't enjoy this great work for what it is, and who instead choose to incessantly take apart every little detail, ranging from the acting and direction to the script's excessive - or dearth of - fidelity to the story and other pointless minutiae, try removing your head from your posterior and maybe you'll get a better view of things. These are the same clods who are so full of themselves that some feel the need to list book mistakes on their two-bit websites, as if they believe that doing so will elevate them to a special plateau. While we're on the subject of fidelity, what the hell does overfaithfulness to the story mean, anyway? 9\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"16 April 2003","score":"","review":"  This rich adaptation of the first of J.K.
