After reading the reviews, on here, about Queen of the Damned, I was convinced to skip it at the theaters. It was pretty obvious by the scorching reviews that this was not going to be a cinematic epiphany. It should be noted that I am and always will be a huge fan of Anne Rice's work. I have read and loved the Vampire Chronicles by her and Queen of the Damned was one of my favorites. I know how Hollywood works though and had rather low expectations on how they would treat this story. While being grateful that I didn't pay theater prices to see it, I also feel it doesn't deserve the flaying it has received.First of all most of the movie was based on The Vampire Lestat and not Queen of the Damned. Second, no, it is not possible to contain the entire scope of this story into 111 minutes. But then, what do you do when the lead actress dies suddenly? Do like they did on The Crow and try to put some semblance of a motion picture together? Exactly. I think they did a pretty good job here, considering. While the performances weren't &#145;break-out' they were passable, they did move the story along. And there WAS a story here, a diluted one, yes, but a story just the same. It didn't follow the books exactly but you recognize enough of the characters that your memory can easily fill in the gaps. In fact the people that read the books should have had an easier time with this than those who did not. As always there was artistic license taken, especially with the ending but, given the circumstances, I felt the attempt to capture the feel of the books was there. The look and movements of the vampires were exactly as I imagined from the books, which was missing from Interview. (Go back and look at that film again. Especially the scene when Pitt is burning down the mansion. Talk about over-the-top drama! And tell me Mathew Newton as Armand, in this one, did not at least LOOK perfect; far better than Antonio Banderas in Interview) It may have been better converting the books into a mini-series or chronicle like the Lord of the Rings movies but, alas, not so. I don't think an attempt should or could have been made to put these stories on the big screen until now. I think if an attempt would have been made back when the Vampire Lestat was first published (1985) it would have been laughable. Today's music, fashion and attitude just seem to fit better. Not to mention the special effects technology is far superior now. What better time for Lestat to rise than this period, when we have Marylin Mansons and Rob Zombies running around? Why not a Vampire Lestat? (You know Trent Reznor would promote him and he'd wear Dolce & Gabbana just because it was expensive) Although this movie certainly fell short of the mark I feel it was attempting to reach, it wasn't horrible to watch. In fact as just a movie, not considering the novels, it wasn't that bad at all. It was no worse than those Mummy movies.

Some say it looked rather MTV like&#133; well, don't you think it was supposed to and shouldn't it be so? We are dealing with the brat prince, Lestat de Lioncourt, right? Don't you think Lestat himself would have taken advantage of the MTV generation? You don't really think he'd settle for public access, do you?

I expected to be, too, but I wasn't. A lot of Austin fans seem to have expected a new plot and I'll amdit that this was mostly recycling the old elements. But I think this sequel, although it lacked in originality and plot, was just as funny as the previous ones.Sure, the plot is thin - even surprisingly thin, considering the other two movies had a coherent plot. The story doesn't seem important to the writers this time, it doesn't really proceed for most of the movie, it's just parodies and gags. That's ok, though, as long as they're funny. And for the most part, they are.The beginning is hilarious. Tom Cruise as Austin, Gwyneth Paltrow as the girl, Kevin Spacey as Dr Evil and Danny DeVito as Mini Me? LOL!! It's so unexpected and well made. However, the Britney Spears cameo is disappointing and the musician cameos are just dull. All they do is play the keyboards. The whole Hollywood idea doesnt' really fit well with Austin Powers. Especially the ending seems to take some of the edge off the story.Michael Caine\/Nigel Powers seems unnecessary. The whole father plot is a bit weird, especially the ending. It seems like a good idea, but they just don't use the character enough. Nigel doesn't have half the charisma of Austin, either, although he seems to like women as much.Foxxy Cleopatra was also a bit disappointing. After the hilarious first scene with the lip synching man - it looked SO weird! -, she fails to make a real impression. In fact, she does almost nothing throughout the whole movie. She just stands there and looks sexy.Goldmember is a bad character. He's insulting to Dutch people, and non-Americans in general (why are Americans so xenophobic? Everyone has an accent, there's nothing funny about that). And he just plainly isn't funny. The mole thing - funny the first two times, but there could have been less of it. Fat Bastard is exactly the same as in the last film, and I always found him gross and unfunny. I didn't want to see him again. The sumo wrestling part was funny though.The funniest character is Mini-Me, although I didn't like some of the scenes that made him act like a dog. Mini-Me as Austin is the funniest thing about the movie. Dr Evil isn't quite as funny as in the previous though, but still gets a lot of laughs.I think Austin himself is losing some of his charm - in some scenes he talked in a voice that was too normal for Austin, like when he was visiting Dr Evil in the jail. Nothing groovy about that scene. Somehow it seemed that Mike Myers sometimes forgot he was playing Austin Powers. That's the impression I got anyway.It seems no one else liked Dr Evil and Mini-Me's version of Hard Knock Life, but I found it simply hilarious. It was so surprising! I think it was funnier than Just the two of us in The Spy Who Shagged Me. The Japanese subtitles joke was funny although it was a bit overlong, and I also liked the doctor's appointment scene. Some jokes, like the Japanese twins, were a bit dumb, but there were also some great puns(like the..eh..linguist one).All in all, Austin Powers in Goldmember is as funny as the other two, although it lacks some of the originality and charisma. I laughed throughout the film, just some overlong scenes at the end seemed boring. There was a lot of gross stuff, but not too much in my opinion. I liked this, but I hope there won't be an Austin Powers IV. This is still a worthy movie and would be a good ending for the series. The next one might just suck.

Not because his films are bad, but because they are so good, and there is hardly anything like them out there today.  Watching Storytelling in the theater was a blessing, but afterwards, my friends and I could only feel completely depressed!  If you've never experienced Solondz's magic, this film can leave you a bit more uplifted, as you have Welcome to the Dollhouse and Happiness still left to explore.  But if you've already seen these films, watching Storytelling can only make you feel bad, like a quickie, it's so good then when it's over, poof, you're bored and you want something else just like it, but different.  I wish Todd Solondz made more films, but sadly after you watch those three, you're done, and it's back to putting up with dumpsters of celluloid garbage for the next year or two until his next film.  I mean let's face it; where else are you going to find a great performance from John freakin' Goodman!Sadly though, I find it hard to convince certain TYPES of people as to why Solondz's work is so good.  I try to tell them the writing is award-winning and beyond most failed attempts at culture critique.  I try and tell them how good the performances are.  I even try and point out some fantastic themes out of the multitude available in his work.  But these certain types, they just can't seem to get it.But on the bright side, the one thing that does give me a boast about Storytelling is Conan O'Brien.  Now, it's not the fact that he's here, but how he fits in, it's like there are people out there that do NOT understand Conan or his humor at all, they just don't get HIM altogether.  Then there are those, such as myself, that completely understand Conan and all his self-deprecation.  How can you not love a character like Scooby that wants to be Conan's sidekick??? Is this NOT the dream of every self-deprecating teenager and college student?!?  Being able to simple make that point in a film, as Solondz does so perfectly during that scene with Scooby and Conan, right after the proverbial gay pseudo blow-job, is something most auteur's can't ever GET AT.  This is why it's depressing watching the film, you see how brilliant this man is and how clearly he can speak his mind and say to you I hear YOU, I feel this way, and I know you do too, and this is here for US to enjoy, not just something for everyone.  Some people say Art is something everyone can universally appreciate.  Others say it is completely subjective.  I think it can in fact be both ways.  You can look at Storytelling or actually Happiness is better for this as formulaic, or formal art, the technical way the film is put together is brilliant, that's its universal art.  The thematics, the way the auteur says what's directly on his mind in a way that a certain kind of person is immediately able to grasp a hold of firmly, that's the other kind, the subjective kind.

Not because his films are bad, but because they are so good, and there is hardly anything like them out there today.  Watching Storytelling in the theater was a blessing, but afterwards, my friends and I could only feel completely depressed!  If you've never experienced Solondz's magic, this film can leave you a bit more uplifted, as you have Welcome to the Dollhouse and Happiness still left to explore.  But if you've already seen these films, watching Storytelling can only make you feel bad, like a quickie, it's so good then when it's over, poof, you're bored and you want something else just like it, but different.  I wish Todd Solondz made more films, but sadly after you watch those three, you're done, and it's back to putting up with dumpsters of celluloid garbage for the next year or two until his next film.  I mean let's face it; where else are you going to find a great performance from John freakin' Goodman!Sadly though, I find it hard to convince certain TYPES of people as to why Solondz's work is so good.  I try to tell them the writing is award-winning and beyond most failed attempts at culture critique.  I try and tell them how good the performances are.  I even try and point out some fantastic themes out of the multitude available in his work.  But these certain types, they just can't seem to get it.But on the bright side, the one thing that does give me a boast about Storytelling is Conan O'Brien.  Now, it's not the fact that he's here, but how he fits in, it's like there are people out there that do NOT understand Conan or his humor at all, they just don't get HIM altogether.  Then there are those, such as myself, that completely understand Conan and all his self-deprecation.  How can you not love a character like Scooby that wants to be Conan's sidekick??? Is this NOT the dream of every self-deprecating teenager and college student?!?  Being able to simple make that point in a film, as Solondz does so perfectly during that scene with Scooby and Conan, right after the proverbial gay pseudo blow-job, is something most auteur's can't ever GET AT.  This is why it's depressing watching the film, you see how brilliant this man is and how clearly he can speak his mind and say to you I hear YOU, I feel this way, and I know you do too, and this is here for US to enjoy, not just something for everyone.  Some people say Art is something everyone can universally appreciate.  Others say it is completely subjective.  I think it can in fact be both ways.  You can look at Storytelling or actually Happiness is better for this as formulaic, or formal art, the technical way the film is put together is brilliant, that's its universal art.  The thematics, the way the auteur says what's directly on his mind in a way that a certain kind of person is immediately able to grasp a hold of firmly, that's the other kind, the subjective kind.  This man understands communication, let alone life, like very very VERY few writers and directors ever have and ever will.

Since it's been so widely hailed and lauded, I admit to now feeling a little guilty about my negative feelings. Nonetheless, they still persist.On a personal note, I had the pleasure of residing in mid-Manhattan, New York City, between 1956 and 1961.  The whole time I was there, I read or heard nothing of the ethnic problems that the Jets and Sharks act out in Authur Laurent's play. As far as I know, the Puerto Ricans and Anglos got along just fine.  While there may have been an occasional minor skirmish between a few individuals in certain Bronx or lower Manhattan neighborhoods, they were rare, isolated incidents, which hardly made press.Therefore, it was a bit of a start to see Laurents use these quite compatible real-life groups as dramatic foil for his Montague-Capulet counterparts in his Romeo mod treatment.  I still recall sitting in the audience the third week after West Side premiered on stage at the Winter Garden Theater on Broadway, and being rather repelled by what Laurents had done in terms of ethnic exploitation. Frankly, I didn't like that particular element at all, in spite of its admittedly brilliant over-all production. (It also was awkward for me, in that I happened to personally knew a number of the dance-cast members from their studying ballet at the June Taylor Dance School a few blocks away.)When this work was transferred to film, I again saw it shortly after it opened in a Broadway movie house with gigantic screen and booming stereo.  Of course, the productional effects were overwhelming--yet that annoying exploitation element persisted--and does so to this day.As far as I'm concerned, there was never nor is now little or no basis in reality for the depiction of the Jets and Sharks in terms of these particular ethnic groups, in New York City or its boroughs.  As a result, I've never completely bought the fundamental premise of Laurent's Shakespeare updating.  Thus, my appreciation of West Side Story continues to be decidedly diminished.

Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind is a great example of what I'm talking about, and although it's a completely different kind of film, Signs is the flip side of the same coin. Spielberg's film was hopeful and featured aliens who we can assume were benignly curious about us. Both films are not about the actual aliens, but rather about the way the knowledge of intelligent alien life changes the characters.

The characters are vividly created, both at the level of the script and in the acting. There's not a bad actor among them. Ultimately the film doesn't want to show you the aliens, although it does and they are very creepy.

Sure it's foolish of the alien race to try and engage human beings in battle on a planet covered with water, something that destroys them. Look at the foolish things human beings do all the time--although our mistakes are on a much smaller scale, what is so preposterous about an unknown enemy being so egotistic to think that they could pull off their invasion despite their own weaknesses? We don't understand anything about them other than what is right on the surface. We can't comprehend their race, let alone their motivations, and there are numerous reasons why they could be doing what they're doing. Perhaps they are raiding Earth out of desperation, despite their aversion to water. Maybe they have never encountered liquid water, or are just learning how harmful it really is for them. Maybe they learned this well into their attack plan, but their own desperation or hubris made them attempt it anyway. Perhaps we're the only other life in the universe they've encountered, and they don't have a choice. Perhaps they're so intelligent they lack common sense--and who hasn't known a human being like that at one time or another? Whatever the reason, Signs isn't about that. It's about the way that irrefutable proof of alien life would change us as human beings, and make us consider what is important to us and what is meaningful. Not only that, its impact comes from the small family at its core and how they are coming to terms with their own tragedy. The fact that the father's crisis of faith seems counterintuitive to the film's revelations doesn't particularly bother me--personally, I think the arrival of alien beings on Earth would result in such madness and terror that the aliens would not even have to invade for us to destroy ourselves.

Sure it's foolish of the alien race to try and engage human beings in battle on a planet covered with water, something that destroys them. Look at the foolish things human beings do all the time--although our mistakes are on a much smaller scale, what is so preposterous about an unknown enemy being so egotistic to think that they could pull off their invasion despite their own weaknesses? We don't understand anything about them other than what is right on the surface. We can't comprehend their race, let alone their motivations, and there are numerous reasons why they could be doing what they're doing. Perhaps they are raiding Earth out of desperation, despite their aversion to water. Maybe they have never encountered liquid water, or are just learning how harmful it really is for them. Maybe they learned this well into their attack plan, but their own desperation or hubris made them attempt it anyway. Perhaps we're the only other life in the universe they've encountered, and they don't have a choice. Perhaps they're so intelligent they lack common sense--and who hasn't known a human being like that at one time or another? Whatever the reason, Signs isn't about that. It's about the way that irrefutable proof of alien life would change us as human beings, and make us consider what is important to us and what is meaningful. Not only that, its impact comes from the small family at its core and how they are coming to terms with their own tragedy. The fact that the father's crisis of faith seems counterintuitive to the film's revelations doesn't particularly bother me--personally, I think the arrival of alien beings on Earth would result in such madness and terror that the aliens would not even have to invade for us to destroy ourselves. As human beings, much of our self image and our morality depends on us being the highest form of life in the universe, the very center of a universe created by a God that we believe is fixated on us and what we're doing. Such irrefutable proof of something bigger in the universe than us would disrupt all of that, and result in mass hysteria and possibly the unraveling of our society. Signs is the only movie I've seen that has attempted to take on these issues realistically, since it shows us its main characters losing this innocence and being fearful of what will replace it.

It's pretty much typical Disney -- why does the word hijinks come to mind whenever I think of this kind of movie?  The story, with its parallels to Pygmalion (and hence My Fair Lady) and Pretty Woman, was predictable, but I suppose I was in the mood for predictable because that didn't bother me.  It seemed like half the supporting cast of Pretty Woman was in it; I noticed Hector Elizondo, of course, and the man who played Mr. Hollister as the (rather odd) beautician, as well as Dennis the elevator operator as the neighbor, and even the man from the French restaurant with a repeat of his it happens all the time line.One endearing thing about this particular homely-girl-becomes-attractive script was the way Mia (played quite well by newcomer Anne Hathaway) would lapse back into her pre-princess-lesson self under pressure.  Well-done.  However, I would *love* to see a movie where the homely girl stayed homely and people learned to like her anyway.  Or even one where you couldn't tell from the homely girl's first scene that it had taken a great deal of work to make the beautiful actress look homely.  I have never liked the two-faced Hollywood treatment of looks -- they give lip service to the fact that it's a person's self who matters, and not his\/her appearance, but everything from Beauty and the Beast to She's All That has as a pivotal moment the transformation from ugh to wow. All in all, this is a good movie if you enjoy the likes of The Parent Trap and its remake.  By the way, if you've read the book, you'll want to forget that while you watch the movie, or you'll spend the whole time being bothered by the MANY changes.
