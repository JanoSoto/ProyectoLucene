A father's (obsessive) love for his daughter(s) is featured in both movies, consequently the theme must mean something special to Egoyan. He is a most talented and original movie maker, a Canadian as are his players, Bruce Greenwood, (Francis Brown, the accountant whose daughter was murdered), Sarah Polley, (Tracey, the high school girl), and Mia Kirshner, (Christina, the exotic dancer). His wife, Arsinee Khanjian and Polley were also featured in The Sweet Hereafter.What really makes the movie is Egoyan's use of time and action sequence. He cuts up the chronological order of events and then presents them in a dramatic way. This is not so easy to do. Christopher Nolan in Memento (2000) used the same technique to great advantage. I have come late to such a technique and would love to master it myself. I worked on it last year and a couple of years before. You can't just scissor it and then paste it back together. Something must be gained from reversing the order of events. When Eric and Christina are shown walking the fields in a long line of people I jumped to the conclusion that Tracey would be found dead. We don't learn that Francis lost his daughter until the film is nearly finished.The psychology of Francis and the young girls is interesting. Christina says she gave something to him and he gave something to her. This vagueness with its unmistakable sexuality is something that always exists between young girls and older men. And, as Egoyan observes, there are rules and awkwardness, and confused emotions.

She often doesn't know whether she really wants to be taken fully, and of course that is usually, shall we say, problematic.

His character Francis Brown is content with fantasy and does not touch at all.This film would have found a larger audience except for the title, the theme, and the milieu. The female audience for the most part didn't even consider watching the movie since, as one woman said, I thought it was just another movie with an older man lusting after a girl half his age. That theme bores women to death. But surprisingly at the IMDb a viewer asks how women feel about the film and several write in to say that they liked it. Another poster remarks that women over forty actually liked Exotica in higher percentages than males.I thought the veracious and business-like depiction of the exotic dancer club was well done. The very nice side plot with the gay animal importer was just a perfect fit for the main plot. Egoyan wrote the script. It is a great script. So much surprises. It's almost too good. For me, since I have seen so many, many movies, something different, some surprises in plot, in character, in treatment are always welcome.And the plot does surprise. Even when the protagonist, Francis waits outside the club to shoot Eric, Egoyan turns the situation on its head by having Eric appear from the side and explain something that changes Francis's attitude toward him.I am being vague because I don't want to spoil the story.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"19 April 2008","score":"6 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" The biggest gripe I have with City of Industry is not because of its familiarity but for its execution. I love the genre of noir, pulpy crime and a couple of heist films but City of Industry is just a bank job too far; a wise talking gangster too far and a story of pulp fiction too far. City of Industry takes place in a world in which car alarms do not exist; in which if someone kicks open your apartment door and you're asleep, you do not wake up; a world in which people can survive multiple gun shot wounds without professional medical help and a world in which jewellery robbers don't wear masks. Throw in some badly done gunfights and a weak romance sub-plot and you have a sort of fun at times gritty crime film but something forgettable in the long run.The biggest problem I had with City of Industry is its point of view approach. It sounds like a funny thing to be pulling up a film for but just who exactly is the protagonist here? Who are we supposed to be following? Who's telling this story? It seems the film wants us to focus on several different characters at once but only one of them is in the film long enough for us to care for them while the others fill in the blanks when Roy Egan (Keitel) isn't on screen. At the beginning, Rachel (Janssen) and Jorge (Dominguez) talk on the phone &#150; he is due to go to prison for a few years and Rachel, his wife, is upset about this as you'd expect only twenty minutes later the film's initial incident has happened and Jorge is out of the picture. Before you say something, this is not a spoiler because the film's premise is a guy hunts for a betrayer after they kill his two heist partners. That gives away enough right there so why does the film have its initial character build up revolve around someone it'll kill off ten minutes later?Secondly, it seems that Egan is the character from whose point of view we're seeing this. The scene that suggests this is when he's standing at the trailer door when Skip (well played by Stephen Dorff) arrives because the camera cuts to his point of view; the point of view angle is very important as it puts the audience in the character's head, so the film has changed its mind again. The closing monologue all about how it was 'our' struggle and no one will ever know 'our' story is told to us by a character who has just spent all of about nine minutes on screen. Sorry, but it's not 'your' story because you didn't even do anything bar stay at home and look after the kids &#150; at this point the protagonist (or who we think is the protagonist) has disappeared.So the film is muddled in who is delivering the film, whose story is it anyway? Think of any other film that uses voice over work and chances are when they show other characters doing things a million miles away from them, the film will never 'shift' to their point of view. And so the film's initial incident kicks Egan into action as he punches and shoots his way through the city looking for Skip, an amateur amongst professionals with his mistreating of women and his hip, fancy music. There is some fun to be had out of this little journey because the film is feeding its narrative drive (that is, revenge) with the obligatory yet entertaining scenes you expect. Egan floors a jerk of a bartender, he spends some time with the widow that is Rachel and he gets around stealing cars and interrogating people &#150; good fun, you think.But then the film steers itself off the thin track it was already on. Revenge is still in the back of the film's mind but it is not the drive anymore. There is a sub-plot that opens up involving money, owed money, stolen money; I'm not sure. All I know is that Skip gets into trouble with some African-American gangsters and hell threatens to break loose; I say 'threaten' because nothing much actually happens.

I love the genre of noir, pulpy crime and a couple of heist films but City of Industry is just a bank job too far; a wise talking gangster too far and a story of pulp fiction too far. City of Industry takes place in a world in which car alarms do not exist; in which if someone kicks open your apartment door and you're asleep, you do not wake up; a world in which people can survive multiple gun shot wounds without professional medical help and a world in which jewellery robbers don't wear masks. Throw in some badly done gunfights and a weak romance sub-plot and you have a sort of fun at times gritty crime film but something forgettable in the long run.The biggest problem I had with City of Industry is its point of view approach. It sounds like a funny thing to be pulling up a film for but just who exactly is the protagonist here? Who are we supposed to be following? Who's telling this story? It seems the film wants us to focus on several different characters at once but only one of them is in the film long enough for us to care for them while the others fill in the blanks when Roy Egan (Keitel) isn't on screen. At the beginning, Rachel (Janssen) and Jorge (Dominguez) talk on the phone &#150; he is due to go to prison for a few years and Rachel, his wife, is upset about this as you'd expect only twenty minutes later the film's initial incident has happened and Jorge is out of the picture. Before you say something, this is not a spoiler because the film's premise is a guy hunts for a betrayer after they kill his two heist partners. That gives away enough right there so why does the film have its initial character build up revolve around someone it'll kill off ten minutes later?Secondly, it seems that Egan is the character from whose point of view we're seeing this. The scene that suggests this is when he's standing at the trailer door when Skip (well played by Stephen Dorff) arrives because the camera cuts to his point of view; the point of view angle is very important as it puts the audience in the character's head, so the film has changed its mind again. The closing monologue all about how it was 'our' struggle and no one will ever know 'our' story is told to us by a character who has just spent all of about nine minutes on screen. Sorry, but it's not 'your' story because you didn't even do anything bar stay at home and look after the kids &#150; at this point the protagonist (or who we think is the protagonist) has disappeared.So the film is muddled in who is delivering the film, whose story is it anyway? Think of any other film that uses voice over work and chances are when they show other characters doing things a million miles away from them, the film will never 'shift' to their point of view. And so the film's initial incident kicks Egan into action as he punches and shoots his way through the city looking for Skip, an amateur amongst professionals with his mistreating of women and his hip, fancy music. There is some fun to be had out of this little journey because the film is feeding its narrative drive (that is, revenge) with the obligatory yet entertaining scenes you expect. Egan floors a jerk of a bartender, he spends some time with the widow that is Rachel and he gets around stealing cars and interrogating people &#150; good fun, you think.But then the film steers itself off the thin track it was already on. Revenge is still in the back of the film's mind but it is not the drive anymore. There is a sub-plot that opens up involving money, owed money, stolen money; I'm not sure. All I know is that Skip gets into trouble with some African-American gangsters and hell threatens to break loose; I say 'threaten' because nothing much actually happens.

It was originally set at a $2 million budget, but ending up at $44 million. With such a high budget film, it makes me wonder how it could be a flop in the box office. After now seeing it, I can marvel at its grandeur of the magnificent costumes, sets\/art direction, visual effects, countless extras, and amazing visual effects (especially for such an old movie). But what it lacks is the main components that make an epic film a solid story and great performances.There was much that happened in Cleopatra's life, and trying to cover it within three hours is almost impossible. I didn't see the 192-minute version, but the 248-minute version. Even this cut was missing some plots. The film pretty much is broken into almost two separate stories. The first part is about the relationship between Cleopatra and Julius Caesar. It was interesting to watch as their love for each other bloomed and the power struggles it took for Caesar to get Cleopatra's power back over Egypt from her brother.After the inevitable death of Caesar, the rest of the movie is pretty much the love\/hate relationship between Cleopatra and her new lover Marc Antony. This is when the film becomes a complete bore-fest of nothing more than Richard Burton pouring out his feelings to Elizabeth Taylor, and her saying, Yes or No to him. It was so dull that even the naval battle at the end could not pull me out of apathy.As with Elizabeth Taylor's acting, she is good for the first half as a strong, determined leader, but for the rest of the movie she just wore pretty costumes and cries when her relationship goes down between Antony. I overall have mixed feelings for this movie. I would give the first half a 9 but the other half a 3. So that averages to 6\/10.-Now doubt this was the starting point of where great acting and plot was not needed to make a film, as is most films nowadays.

Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are teamed up again in a nice little romantic comedy and the producers no doubt hope that people can forget Sleepless in Seattle, also written and directed by Nora Ephron, and accept an entirely new story. And like Runaway Bride, it worked. The premise of the story is ludicrous in the extreme, not just that two highly attractive people fall in love through online chatting, but more because they get to know each other in real life at exactly the same time as they are starting to get to know each other online. It's a pretty wild aberration from reality, but on the other hand it allows for a compelling analysis of the different personalities that people assume online and in real life. There is also something to be said about the characterization. Tom Hanks plays on his status as a Hollywood megastar to portray the CEO of a mega bookstore chain, and who better to play the owner of a cute little corner bookstore than Meg Ryan, who is so cute that she could very well represent a 10 on a 1-10 cuteness scale. 10 being the cutest and one being, I don't know, Burt Lancaster or something. I find it a little amusing that the title of the film is from that asinine voice that used to welcome you when you would sign on to the internet back in the mid to late 90s, back when people still used AOL. There is a healthy level of irony included in the movie, as Joe Fox (Hanks) opens one of his massive bookstores around the corner from Kathleen's (Ryan) little shop, and she turns to her online friend, Joe, for help and advice. I appreciate how well they hide their identities, although they have such polarly opposite opinions about commercialism and professional ethics that it seems almost impossible that they should get along so well, especially when Kathleen, at least, is looking for comforting words to help her get through an experience that people like Joe make their living doing to people.I really like that the movie makes such a strong comment about megastores without making them seem evil, or demonizing the people that open and run them. Quite the opposite, in fact. Joe Fox, who is destroying the future of a charming little bookstore that Kathleen inherited from her mother, seems like a perfect fit for the greedy, commercial movie villain, but the whole charm of the movie is that we meet a wealthy businessman with dollar signs in his eyes, and before we know it we're rooting for his happiness. It takes a massive charm, like Hanks', to pull something like that off.While it's sad to see so many small businesses perish under the influence of the homogenized, impersonal super stores, it's also a sad reality of any growing society. Consider, for example, the emotional pain and insignificance that milkmen must have felt when the first supermarkets came along with their refrigerators and their plastic jugs back in the 50s and 60s. The neighborhood lost something of its personality and charm, interpersonal relationships were totally transformed, but now it's hard to imagine an American city without a Safeway or an Albertson's, or even a Piggly Wiggly. I think the really evil stores are ones like Wal Mart, which might be surpassing McDonald's as the worst American company. But the biggest problem with Wal Mart is the greed of the family that owns it. They bleed their employees dry while pocketing astronomical profits, and opening a store in every city imaginable. I live in a small town in central eastern China called Luoyang, and yes, a Wal Mart opened here a few months ago. Unbelievable.But the comment that this movie makes is that, love them or hate them, they are definitely convenient and affordable, and it's even fun to poke around in them. The biggest problem with them is that they are impersonal, you lose that quality of knowing people on a first name basis, and even of having employees who know about what they're selling. There's a scene in this movie where Kathleen wanders into Joe's store and has an experience where we learn that the movie understands this loss of a personal, friendly atmosphere. For all the lack of realism about how Joe and Kathleen meet and the fact that they fall in love, the movie is charming and fun and it's hard to remain indifferent to the happiness of the main characters. They each start the movie with other significant others, but end their respective relationships, leaving them newly single polar opposites looking to each other online for comfort and support.

The neighborhood lost something of its personality and charm, interpersonal relationships were totally transformed, but now it's hard to imagine an American city without a Safeway or an Albertson's, or even a Piggly Wiggly. I think the really evil stores are ones like Wal Mart, which might be surpassing McDonald's as the worst American company. But the biggest problem with Wal Mart is the greed of the family that owns it. They bleed their employees dry while pocketing astronomical profits, and opening a store in every city imaginable. I live in a small town in central eastern China called Luoyang, and yes, a Wal Mart opened here a few months ago. Unbelievable.But the comment that this movie makes is that, love them or hate them, they are definitely convenient and affordable, and it's even fun to poke around in them. The biggest problem with them is that they are impersonal, you lose that quality of knowing people on a first name basis, and even of having employees who know about what they're selling. There's a scene in this movie where Kathleen wanders into Joe's store and has an experience where we learn that the movie understands this loss of a personal, friendly atmosphere. For all the lack of realism about how Joe and Kathleen meet and the fact that they fall in love, the movie is charming and fun and it's hard to remain indifferent to the happiness of the main characters. They each start the movie with other significant others, but end their respective relationships, leaving them newly single polar opposites looking to each other online for comfort and support. This might be the most obvious set-up I've seen in a movie in some years, so it's a testament to the quality of the movie that it's still a fun ride to the inevitable conclusion&#133; ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"19 April 2008","score":"9 out of 19 people found the following review useful","review":" I have never been crazy about foreign made westerns because in my humble opinion it's an original American art form.

The original was classic sci-fi; my memory was that the sequels got progressively sillier and sillier. It's true that Beneath The Planet Of The Apes is not as good as the original, but still it's not a bad movie.The role (although through a different character) that was played by Charlton Heston (who appears in this at the beginning and end, and has a fairly substantive role in the end) in the original is now played by James Franciscus.

This movie also lacks some of the humour of the original. The only line I recall that seemed to try to recapture some of the funny spirit was when Zira (again played by Kim Hunter) was treating a somewhat apprehensive Brent for a gunshot wound, and says - in an attempt to reassure him - don't worry.

Their Gloria Patri (glory be to the Father, and to the the Son, and to the Holy Spirit) is restated as glory be to the bomb and to the holy fallout! The hymn All Things Bright And Beautiful is sung to a very strange tune with the word bomb replacing the word God. The movie is obviously anti-religion, clearly in sympathy, for example, with the rather naive world view expressed by John Lennon in the song Imagine which seems to believe that if only we could get rid of this horrible thing called religion we'd have perfect peace. (I think we'd just find other things to fight about!) That's the thing that really weakened this movie, to me at least - not so much the anti-religion feel, but just that the movie seemed more jaded in general terms than the original, which came across in many ways as more light-hearted.Having said that, I don't have to agree with the perspective of a movie to find it enjoyable, and for the most part I thought this was well done.

I like the 1995 remake with Harrison Ford, and my favorite line from the remake (Sabrina to Linus) They say you're the world's only living heart donor. I love that line, but while there isn't an equivalent of that zinger in the Bogart\/Hepburn version, I do think this is the superior product. This has Audrey Hepburn (Ormond can't compare), and it has the comedic\/surrealistic touches of Billy Wilder (yes, Pollack can do comedy. I thought Tootsie was funny under Pollack's direction, and maybe Pollack should stick to original scripts like that).More than that, Sabrina is a product of the times. Compare the 1995 and the 1954 versions. There are lines in the 1954 version that can't be said in the 1995 version without people laughing at the wrong times. Are these more cynical times? Are there things we can't believe people doing now (like Linus's noble attitude in the end), making the remake seem anachronistic? I think that's the real problem with the remake. This 1954 version exists, and it sparkles and zips along faster than Ford's version. Ford's version doesn't distinguish itself enough.

If you can get past that, you'll find a lot to like in this film. Will gets a huge break when Rolling Stone hires him to write a story about the rock band Stillwater; they've read some of his stuff and are impressed, and since everything is conducted over the phone, the editor has no idea of his real age. What commences then is a teen's wet dream, going on tour with a rock group, hanging out with them backstage and being taken in by them as a confidant. The movie captures a second-tier rock act's tour and all the excitement, chaos, and drug-fueled stupidity that engulfs and surrounds it brilliantly. The band members, their groupies, their manager, the roadies, and Will are all on the same crazy train ride, sucked into the ongoing insanity that was a rock and roll tour back in the seventies. Some things have changed since then, some haven't, but the enduring myths and realities of the rock lifestyle are painted vividly here. The fact that most people know or suspect what goes on behind the scenes doesn't diminish the drama and humor in 'Almost Famous.' It somehow manages to be both familiar and surprising. At times, it's like a believable version of 'This Is Spinal Tap.' And 'believable' is a good starting description for the fictional band Stillwater. It is to the actors' and director's credit that the group is portrayed so realistically, down to the last detail, that you'll swear you remember seeing them on tour with Foghat or Black Oak Arkansas. I know I did; the first time I saw 'Almost Famous' was with a group of friends and I actually said, Yeah, I think I remember these guys. Which, of course, makes no sense since the movie is twenty-five years after the 'fact,' and not even the Rolling Stones have preserved that well. Stillwater's big hit in the movie, 'Fever Dog,' sounds like it could have come straight out of Molly Hatchet's songbook. There is an excruciatingly hilarious scene which takes place after one of their shows that is almost impossible to describe. The band's leader holds court in a bedroom like some kind of stoned messiah, groupies and fan boys hanging on his every chemically-altered word as if it were Biblical prophecy. It helps if you have actually been in such a situation before (as I have) but it's not absolutely necessary. And then there's the scene on the airplane where the band and everyone else on board are convinced they're about to crash and so the deathbed confessions come flying, fast and furious. You'll be catching your breath after that bit as well. A groupie (Kate Hudson) who goes by the name Penny Lane figures prominently into the proceedings and, you guessed it, young William falls in love with her which complicates matters that were pretty damn complicated to begin with. In the end, everything turns out fine; Will gets his story published in Rolling Stone, the band keeps touring and the principals involved are left, like the audience, shaking their heads and thinking, Whoa, did all that really happen? No, it didn't, but it sure seems like it did.

At times, it's like a believable version of 'This Is Spinal Tap.' And 'believable' is a good starting description for the fictional band Stillwater. It is to the actors' and director's credit that the group is portrayed so realistically, down to the last detail, that you'll swear you remember seeing them on tour with Foghat or Black Oak Arkansas. I know I did; the first time I saw 'Almost Famous' was with a group of friends and I actually said, Yeah, I think I remember these guys. Which, of course, makes no sense since the movie is twenty-five years after the 'fact,' and not even the Rolling Stones have preserved that well. Stillwater's big hit in the movie, 'Fever Dog,' sounds like it could have come straight out of Molly Hatchet's songbook. There is an excruciatingly hilarious scene which takes place after one of their shows that is almost impossible to describe. The band's leader holds court in a bedroom like some kind of stoned messiah, groupies and fan boys hanging on his every chemically-altered word as if it were Biblical prophecy. It helps if you have actually been in such a situation before (as I have) but it's not absolutely necessary. And then there's the scene on the airplane where the band and everyone else on board are convinced they're about to crash and so the deathbed confessions come flying, fast and furious. You'll be catching your breath after that bit as well. A groupie (Kate Hudson) who goes by the name Penny Lane figures prominently into the proceedings and, you guessed it, young William falls in love with her which complicates matters that were pretty damn complicated to begin with. In the end, everything turns out fine; Will gets his story published in Rolling Stone, the band keeps touring and the principals involved are left, like the audience, shaking their heads and thinking, Whoa, did all that really happen? No, it didn't, but it sure seems like it did.

If you can get past that, you'll find a lot to like in this film. Will gets a huge break when Rolling Stone hires him to write a story about the rock band Stillwater; they've read some of his stuff and are impressed, and since everything is conducted over the phone, the editor has no idea of his real age. What commences then is a teen's wet dream, going on tour with a rock group, hanging out with them backstage and being taken in by them as a confidant. The movie captures a second-tier rock act's tour and all the excitement, chaos, and drug-fueled stupidity that engulfs and surrounds it brilliantly. The band members, their groupies, their manager, the roadies, and Will are all on the same crazy train ride, sucked into the ongoing insanity that was a rock and roll tour back in the seventies.

The flying, the airplanes and the interaction with aviation in this movie really serves as a means to deliver the real idea.Richard Dreyfuss, Holly Hunter and John Goodman do an amazing job. The overall ambiance of the movie, in my opinion, wipes away all the little things that might bother some moviegoers. I first saw this movie many many years ago and fell in love with it.

I remember watching this film every day with my sister, who also loved it when I was eight. Basically, it's a great film for kids and adults alike.The Story After Babe's wild success at the sheep herding contest, Farmer Arthur Hoggett turns down all offers he gets to utilize Babe's talent. But when he tries to fix the farm well, he gets hurt severely. His wife, Esme Cordelia Hoggett, tries to take the reigns, but the Hoggetts are in serious debt to the bank. Esme Cordelia Hoggett and Babe go to the made up city of Metropolis and stay at the only hotel where pets are allowed. Mrs. Hoggett tries to make some money, but finds herself in trouble with the law when she attacks a thug who mugged her and accidentally starts a riot. Babe, on his own, befriends the animals in the hotel and takes in some outsiders, but gets into even more trouble than Mrs. Hoggett.Babe Pig in the City didn't get a warm reception because how it's more darker than the first movie (ie. the Pitbull nearly drowning while being hanged off a bridge), but, despite also being a box office flop, it did get positive reviews in general and the movie does have a cult following. Film critic Gene Siskel named Babe Pig in the City as his choice for best movie of 1998 and said that it was better than the first movie (I agree with him there).To sum it up, Babe Pig in the City truly is a great movie. I personally think people expected it to be exactly like the first but were disappointed that it wasn't; however, what we got is even better than the first. An excellent movie for a family's night in.
