[{"date":"21 July 2009","score":"2 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Elizabeth reserves its longest, most tedious and elaborately produced scene for the Coronation, which betrays the picture as thinly-veiled official propaganda. The history it deploys belongs in the fascistic Arthur Bryant schoolboy textbooks of the early 20th century. What was really happening during her reign was less the internecine plotting over the succession than the birth of brutal capitalism, corporate plunder and enslavement, all with royal court's approval. Elizabeth was the bastard daughter of Henry VIII, who saw her innocent mother beheaded before her eyes on the orders of her deranged father. The virgin queen promotion that has endured for four and a half centuries, probably stems from Elizabeth Tudor-Boleyn inheriting syphilis from her mad father and infected mother, and refusing male relations because of the fear of infecting her own child. You may be sure such a story would never come out, particularly after such a long reign enabled its complete suppression. On the other hand, the Queen's letters record the incredibly detailed care she took over her own and other aristocrats' courts and retainers. Well educated, she seems to have been a person of outstanding qualities trapped in a historic maelstrom. This puerile film only scratches the surface of what was going on in our UK past and is little more than a chocolate box version of history.

Much of what was not in the original story eventually wound up in this film. The tale is a multi-generational story concerning the family of Jordan Benedict Jr. (Rock Hudson). Being the son of successful rancher, 'Bick' grew up unfortunately as myopic as his father. Much of the way he lives, is seen in his steadfast and prejudicial behavior towards women, servants and the Mexican people who work for him. Despite facts of history concerning the stealing of Texas from Mexico, Jordan refuses to hear anything except his bigoted education. His life begins to alter the day he travels to Maryland to purchase breeding stock and a thoroughbred horse. There amid the lush green surrounding countryside, he is smitten and eventually marries the daughter of Horace Lynnton (Paul Fix), Leslie Lynnton (Elizabeth Taylor). Though she considers herself a lady of quality and breeding, she nevertheless possesses an independent spirit who establishes herself well in the vast brown desert landscape of Texas. James Dean who plays Jett Rink is said to have made quite a lasting impression among younger audiences, secured a lasting cult-status in this film. Rod Taylor, Chill Wills, Dennis Hopper, Sal Mineo, Alexander Scourby, Carroll Baker and Earl Holliman are marvelously fitted for this saga. For Bic Benedict, life holds more than his bias opinions as he soon learns that life, like his ambitious dreams and his contrary attitudes change as does his family and beloved Texas. **** ","genre":null},{"date":"21 July 2009","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Edna Ferber's novel and George Steven's direction produced this elongated version of her novel.

Some of the stars seemed to have a bright feature ahead of them, but most of them didn't do anything.
