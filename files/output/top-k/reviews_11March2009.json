With repeated viewings, the film still looks fresh and feels brand new. Despite the fact that the Man vs. Machine theme present has been done to death in other films, it is tackled by the script in a way that is both unconventional and definitive. Its impact was immediately felt on pop-culture, and still resonates today. It's more than just loud, shoot-em-up fun with stunning visuals. It's also a timeless portrait of where society currently sits and where its unknown future is heading. Social commentary aside, though, it's still incredible entertainment.

True Lies excels at allowing the comedy to come directly from the situations without distracting the viewer from the exciting action story. Over the top action sequences alone can spell doom for any film, yet True Lies combines them with comic relief and still manages to stay riveting over a 2 hour and 20 minute run time. There's plenty of laughs here, yet none of them seem forced. All of the comedic moments come from the characters reactions to the events around them. In fact, there's not one moment where I as a viewer thought I might act differently had I been in the same situation.The chemistry between all the actors is apparent throughout the film. The pairings of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis as husband and wife, as well as Schwarzenegger and Tom Arnold as federal officers, seem outlandish before first viewing the film. Yet the casting is perfect. Some of the best laughs in the film come from moments where two of the characters simply exchange looks. Apparently all the actors got along famously on the set, and that always translates into great chemistry on the screen.Director James Cameron is well known for delivering exciting action sequences and he sets the bar very high here. Although over the top at times, you always buy it. Chase scenes seem to be Cameron's strongest set piece and he provides two especially thrilling sequences in True Lies. A chase through the streets of Washington DC and through a busy hotel is especially unique. Not just because of the locale, but because it involves a horse and a motorcycle. Also, the pursuit of the villains from the Florida Keys to the main land involving trucks, helicopters, and Harrier jets is the highlight of the film.Much has been made of the depictions of the villains from True Lies. Perhaps even in 1994 it was unfairly stereotypical to use fanatical Arab terrorists as your primary villain. However, the fact is that there are bad people of every race, religion, sex, or any other category you can think of for human beings. Was it an indictment on all German people when Hans Gruber led a group of German terrorists into Nakatomi Towers in the film Die Hard? Are all American's evil because Mr. Joshua was such a cruel villain in Lethal Weapon? Are all women deplorable because Selina was portrayed as villainous in Supergirl. Would it really have made a difference (or have been more realistic) if the villains were Portuguese terrorists? You get my point. And let's be fair to True Lies here too. It was 1994. In this film you hear terms like Jihad and Car bomb. Terms that weren't even part of the vernacular in '94, yet are well known today. It could even be fair to say that True Lies was slightly ahead of its time. Is it really all that different from TV's 24? I would recommend True Lies to anyone who's looking for laughs and excitement. The two have never been combined as expertly as they are here. Both men and women can easily identify with the characters and should enjoy themselves equally. I can't believe it's been 15 years since True Lies was released. It still holds up wonderfully. Enjoy!

Set in the Depression era, Mia Farrow is Cecilia, a rather simple person, married to a real cad who expects her to work and give him money. But Cecilia endures the boredom of ordinary life by seeing movies at the local movie house. She can go every afternoon and see the same movie over and over, and get absorbed into its fantasy.The movie running now in her small New Jersey town is an older black and white film called The Purple Rose of Cairo. In it Jeff Daniels is Hollywood actor Gil Shepherd who plays the character, explorer Tom Baxter. But Gil has done such a good job of creating the character of Tom, after a number of showings of the film Tom wants to get out, he wants to get into the real world. And he does, during one showing when he looks at the audience, and speaks to Cecilia, recognizing that she has been in the audience every day.So Tom and Cecilia run away and hide, and the rest of the characters object because they can't move forward in the plot. Eventually things complicate because in the same film being shown in other cities, Tom is attempting to come off the screen, but not yet successful. So the studio bosses worry about both loss of film revenue and about liability if their character comes off the screen and causes trouble. They imagine 100s of Toms running around.So the story turns to how a fictional character, Tom, can get along in the real world, with the scope of his knowledge limited by what was actually in the script. Then, how can they get him back into the screen, into the movie, so that they can shut down the movie everywhere. The actor, Gil, must help.Danny Aiello is the cad of a husband, Monk. Cecilia's sister is played by Farrow's real sister, Stephanie Farrow, as they wait tables together in the greasy spoon café.The story is a fantasy, a well made fantasy. I enjoy it on a number of levels, it is funny, it gets you to think. But most of all the acting of Mia Farrow, she is just perfect here.SPOILERS Eventually Gil has to rely on his acting abilities.

Only he knows the recall code, and when he commits suicide can the President and the Joint Chiefs of Staff find any way of preventing World War Three &#133; ?Written by Kubrick, Terry Southern and Peter George, based on George's novel Red Alert, this brilliant black comedy of nuclear annihilation remains perhaps the funniest and most savage military \/ political satire ever made. The story and its details are completely credible, the characters - despite being twisted buffoons - are instantly recognisable and human, and the movie is both hilarious and terrifying at the same time. The entire cast find exactly the right tone for the film. Sellers repeats his Lolita trick of playing three different parts, Scott is possibly funniest of all, Hayden is perhaps the definitive first in a long line of Kubrick's crazed, staring, psychos, Pickens and Wynn both give career best performances, and watch out for a young Jones as the bombardier. A lot of critics seem to find this film (and Kubrick's work in general) very cold and misanthropic, but this really misses the point. First of all, as satire, it merely serves to remind us not to place too much faith in government \/ technology \/ procedures \/ what have you. But more importantly, it's really a celebration of human ingenuity. The reason the bomber gets through is precisely because they don't follow procedure, they adapt to a new situation, use intuition, solve difficult problems and work out a new plan for themselves. The end result may be catastrophic, but it's also a celebration of individuality and mutability. Kubrick may have been a bit controlling but he really understood people, and that's what makes his work so good. Featuring great sets by James Bond designer Ken Adam, and brilliant photography by Gilbert Taylor - don't miss the shots of an angelic Strangelove surrounded by a halo of light. This movie is packed full of incredibly funny dialogue; if I had to pick a favourite line, it's General Turgidson's masterpiece of understatement, Although I hate to judge before all the facts are in, it's beginning to look like General Ripper exceeded his authority.. Kubrick died ten years ago, but his influence as a giant of both film-making innovation and insight into human nature still permeates all cinema. He was thirty-five when he made this movie and lost the Best Director Academy Award to sixty-five-year-old George Cukor, who won for My Fair Lady; does anybody want to argue with me about which of these was a more talented director ?

First of all, as satire, it merely serves to remind us not to place too much faith in government \/ technology \/ procedures \/ what have you. But more importantly, it's really a celebration of human ingenuity. The reason the bomber gets through is precisely because they don't follow procedure, they adapt to a new situation, use intuition, solve difficult problems and work out a new plan for themselves. The end result may be catastrophic, but it's also a celebration of individuality and mutability. Kubrick may have been a bit controlling but he really understood people, and that's what makes his work so good. Featuring great sets by James Bond designer Ken Adam, and brilliant photography by Gilbert Taylor - don't miss the shots of an angelic Strangelove surrounded by a halo of light. This movie is packed full of incredibly funny dialogue; if I had to pick a favourite line, it's General Turgidson's masterpiece of understatement, Although I hate to judge before all the facts are in, it's beginning to look like General Ripper exceeded his authority.. Kubrick died ten years ago, but his influence as a giant of both film-making innovation and insight into human nature still permeates all cinema. He was thirty-five when he made this movie and lost the Best Director Academy Award to sixty-five-year-old George Cukor, who won for My Fair Lady; does anybody want to argue with me about which of these was a more talented director ? Do not miss this brilliant film.

It's almost impossible, there does not seem to be a word in the English dictionary that can fully describe the total experience of watching such a masterful film. It is moving, heart-wrenching, funny, optimistic, and exciting, all in one.One would think when they hear of the simple premise of a young boy befriending an alien from outer space that not much drama or emotion could be evoked, but that person would be wrong. E.T.'s true heart lies in its simplicity, through a child-like view of the world. As this is rightfully how this film should be, since it is told from the perspective of a child. I think it is because of this simplicity that E.T. has gone on to become one of the greatest films of all-time.When one debates about whether or not which film is director Steven Spielberg's masterpiece, talk quickly begins to circulate around Schindler's List, but in this filmgoers mind E.T. is just as beautiful and poignant as the story of Oskar Schindler. What Spielberg did with this film was simply magical; no other human on Earth could have made this film other than him. E.T. is a lovable character, even though he is so ugly. Spielberg made us care for a character who in the wrong hands would have just ended up being an ugly Muppet that'd terrify children, but thanks to the classic Spielberg touch E.T. was brought to life.While many cynics may bash the film for its all-out sentimentality and gentile nature, I must always hold my tongue from saying something in which I will later on regret. E.T.'s greatest strength lies within its sentimentality and its optimistic nature. It is just another testament to Spielberg's wonderful talents.Overall, I think E.T. is one of the most beautiful films of all-time. It is a film that'll make even the most hardened moviegoer cry, but never tears of sadness, but tears of joy and happiness. When you come to the end of E.T. you feel as if you just got off of one of the best emotional roller coaster rides of your life, and it never changes each time you ride it. This is one of cinema's finest achievements.I give E.T. a perfect 10 out of 10!

To be honest with you, I found the first half hour or so rough going...did feel the urge to switch channels as I didn't find the movie very engaging. However, I stuck with it, and did find it passable after a while.The English rock band The Who are behind this movie, which tells the story of Jimmy Cooper, a Mod who draws his entire social identity from this social group. 'Mods' listen to certain sorts of music and take drugs and ride motorcycles and generally hang out together.Quadrophenia was released about a decade after this particular social movement had reached its peak. In the movie, you will see Jimmy and his friends grooving to the music of The Who, so the band didn't waste the opportunity to market their own music, which, in their favour, would have been the music of choice for mods at that time, no doubt.After the tiresome first half hour, things get more interesting as we see the conflict between The Mods, and The Rockers (a rival gang\/social movement) escalate.This movie is interesting for seeing a long dead scene brought back to life by the members of The Who. If you were around at this time, you may get a kick out of the nostalgia that this movie represents. If you weren't around the time this film was set, you may get a certain novelty value from seeing the quaint mode of transport which the Mods favour!If psychological portraits of gang members appeals to you, this movie will please, as there is much on how Jimmy requires his gang to feel he has a place in this world. But, if the idea of gang movies appeals for the prospect of violence, then the movie does keep you waiting a while for this.By the by, I think I noticed some continuity errors in this film if you look at the scene where the Mods are near a cinema, the movies showing seem anachronistic. More annoyingly, the ending is not clear cut. You assume that something has happened, but if you rewind and look closer, it's not at all clear that what you think happened did in fact happen. Presumably this is just bad editing and cinematography.So...if you are a fan of The Who, or of 60s culture in England, this movie could appeal to you. However, it just took me a while to warm to it, and I didn't find it particularly good-in contrast to the magazine Total Film which ranked it the 35th greatest British movie of all time.

He's a disciple of the infamous sequential butchers of the past, and each of his murder scenes is meticulously directed to refer to the crimes by Son of Sam, Boston and Hillside.That consideration of little fine points longs for an audience, and the killer has one in Sigourney Weaver, a criminal psychologist who has written the book on serial killers and is renowned in said domain. The movie opens as Weaver is giving a lecture. In the audience is one of her former clients, serial killer Daryll Lee Cullum, played in a curious but quite successful piece of casting in the performance of pop-jazz musician Harry Connick, Jr., who smirks perversely with bad teeth. She blinks and he's gone, but she should know better than to go into the women's restroom thereafter.What happens there turns Weaver agoraphobic, and she spends the next year or so hiding in her apartment and drinking too much, so petrified of the world she has to use a broom to pull the newspaper through the front door. Cullum is soon behind bars, but another killer, the copycat, is operating and when Weaver figures out what he's doing, she calls the police officer supervising the investigation.

I would imagine the writers must have panicked when they got the memo, but they certainly delivered. The movie failed at the box office but it has done very well on home video, and rightly so. With the writing staff and cast of the excellent Animated Series, Batman Mask of the Phantasm became the first Batman movie where Batman was not overshadowed by the villains since the Adam West era. The Phantasm is a vigilante who systematically kills all of Gotham City's mob bosses. Witnesses mistake the Phantasm for Batman, and Batman finds himself pursued by the police, despite Commissioner Gordon's support. Batman hunts down the Phantasm to clear his name, but soon his arch-nemesis, the Joker, is hired to take out the Phantasm first!

I first saw it in 2002, and then I'd never heard of Tony Wilson, Factory Records, Joy Division, and was only vaguely aware that there had been a group called The Happy Mondays and a Manchester nightclub called the Hacienda. Yet, it's the strength of Michael Winterbottom's film that it made me wish I was a film director - the picture is so alive with the genuine possibilities of film-making.7 years later, the film stands up to many successive viewings as a piece of genre defying brilliance, and like the best English films - A Matter of Life and Death, A Hard Day's Night, Monty Python and the Holy Grail - finds fantasy in reality.Steve Coogan neither looks nor sounds like the real Tony Wilson - but that's part of the idiosyncratic point of the film. He's terrific in the part of the Cambridge graduate with ambitious plans for the Manchester music scene. The film follows Wilson from 1976, when he is a TV presenter in Manchester, up to closing of his nightclub the Hacienda in the early 1990s. It's the story of his record label, the groups he signed - Joy Division (later to become New Order) and the Happy Mondays - his epic nightclub and lots of civic pride.'24 Hour Party People' portrays the Manchester music scene of the time as being populated by foul, rowdy, drug fuelled yobs. Other than Wilson, none of the characters are remotely likable. Winterbottom's film is full of the authentic shabbiness and aggression of the late-seventies and the 1980s, but whilst the look is realistic, the directional style has an anything goes brilliance about it. For instance, Coogan's Wilson narrates to camera constantly referring to the fact you're watching a film. Indeed, the first scene is a 1976 Granada evening news report about hang gliding after which Wilson tells us - like the film we're about to watch - it works on a literal and metaphorical level. It's full of memorable moments like Shaun and Paul Ryder on a Manchester roof top, feeding the pigeons rat-poison filled bread then watching the pigeons fly and off and drop from the skies dead - all accompanied to the Ride of the Valkyries on the soundtrack. Or Wilson walking across Hacienda dance floor surrounded by frantic clubbers and saying of the birth of the Rave culture Something epoch-making is happening, they're applauding the DJ....Welcome to Madchester.Frank Cotteral Boyce's script gives Coogan's Wilson some sparkling dialogue, such as Jazz is the last refuge of the untalented. Jazz musicians enjoy themselves far more than anyone listening to them.Wilson eventually looses control of his nightclub to drug dealers and has to sell his record company Factory Records after the Happy Mondays spend three months in Barbados spending the company's money on drugs when they should have been recording their new album (they eventually record one, but without lyrics) In the final scene - atop of a gloomy Manchester roof top - Wilson sees a vision of God, who looks just like him. The supporting cast is uniformly good, from Shirley Henderson as his wife, Paddy Considine as Rob, the manager of Joy Division; Andy Serkis as the drunken, drug addicted sound recordist Martin Hannah; even Rob Brydon as a local rock journalist.

Set in 1930's America at the start of the movie, Morosky is a politically active communist on campus, who hands out flyers and speaks at anti-war rallies. The man who will become her love interest is Hubbell Gardiner, played by Robert Redford. Gardiner is more a part of the elite than Morosky and is not politically active at all...he's more hedonistic, hence their being a potential odd couple.For this early part of the movie, you have to suspend disbelief over how much older Streisand and Redford seem in relation to the characters they play. In other words, they look too old for their parts. However, Redford gives a completely winning performance early in the piece as an undergraduate student. He is all easy charm, manners, and engagingly amusing to boot...in contrast to oh so serious Morosky.Now, not being versed in the history of this production, it does come across as Streisand pulling all of the strings. She is not a conventional leading lady, and her pairing with Redford would not seem an obvious choice. To me, their early attraction was glossed over, which made Morosky seem a little bit creepy when she does get into bed with Gardiner for the first time! So, if Streisand did pull a lot of strings to make this movie, it perhaps represents some 'wish fulfilment' on her part! And, as if to explain her presence in this film, Morosky does say some things which seem to have psychoanalytical weight for Streisand's own situation (i.e. Morosky's views on her looks, which may engage the audience member wondering why Streisand is paired with Redford).The undergraduate Morosky may seem a tad annoying early on, but the more mature Morosky does engage more...not being so militant, and ridding herself of that overgrown mop of hair on her head which didn't sit right with me. It's then that it becomes more understandable why Gardiner would be attracted to her.Theirs is an intriguing relationship, especially in how Morosky deals with Gardiner's friends, who are more like him than her. During the period that they are in university together (or maybe it's called 'college' in the US), attention is paid to Gardiner's writing ability. It is this part of the story that will later have a life of its own in the movie. Initially this branch of the story seemed quite odd...why focus on this if this is meant to be a love story? Things become clearer later on, as the historical context of the film's setting becomes clearer. This historical context may prove to be an eye-opener for Americans who are Generation X or Generation Y.When I jotted down notes on this film, I wrote The ending is sort of established, so, like the start, you wonder about the specifics.

So, if Streisand did pull a lot of strings to make this movie, it perhaps represents some 'wish fulfilment' on her part! And, as if to explain her presence in this film, Morosky does say some things which seem to have psychoanalytical weight for Streisand's own situation (i.e. Morosky's views on her looks, which may engage the audience member wondering why Streisand is paired with Redford).The undergraduate Morosky may seem a tad annoying early on, but the more mature Morosky does engage more...not being so militant, and ridding herself of that overgrown mop of hair on her head which didn't sit right with me. It's then that it becomes more understandable why Gardiner would be attracted to her.Theirs is an intriguing relationship, especially in how Morosky deals with Gardiner's friends, who are more like him than her. During the period that they are in university together (or maybe it's called 'college' in the US), attention is paid to Gardiner's writing ability. It is this part of the story that will later have a life of its own in the movie. Initially this branch of the story seemed quite odd...why focus on this if this is meant to be a love story? Things become clearer later on, as the historical context of the film's setting becomes clearer. This historical context may prove to be an eye-opener for Americans who are Generation X or Generation Y.When I jotted down notes on this film, I wrote The ending is sort of established, so, like the start, you wonder about the specifics. Hmmm, not sure what I meant by that!Anyway, I give this film 65\/100. Intriguing, and Redford shows his star qualities here-the Brad Pitt of his day.

I have read some truly unfair reviews, that Pay It Forward is overly sentimental. No, it isn't. The ending was beautiful, and heart-rending too. When I saw this at school, I promised myself I wouldn't cry. But I did oddly enough, but it is very fair to say the ending was very moving, and added to the irony that the young boy Trevor, was unable to change his alcoholic mother's life. The scene in the hospital was also really sad, as I had genuine respect for all the characters.There were unfortunately two flaws with the film. First of all, the script at times was a bit weak, especially when the three protagonists were not the focus. The other flaw was that sometimes the film's structure felt a little confused, but that's just me. Mimi Leder's direction was slick and attentive, the two ingredients you need to make this sort of film work.The performances of the three leads were what held this film together. A wonderfully restrained Kevin Spacey played the disfigured teacher, and the scene where we find out what happened to him was shocking to say the least. Helen Hunt matched him beautifully as the mother, who tries to block out her painful life(prostitution, domestic abuse, an alcoholic family member) with drink, much to the despair of her son, Trevor. The real star is Haley Joel Osment, possibly the most talented child actor on film, who perfectly conveyed the 11 year old boy who wants to make a difference. Who wouldn't? All in all, a thoughtful and insightful film, that is genuinely moving. It isn't the most moving film ever, but it is definitely underrated. 8\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"11 March 2009","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Pay It Forward is not as moving as a film like the Elephant Man and Fearless, but is still a solid and thoughtful account of a boy who wants to change the lives of those he loves.The subject matter was well-realised, and that alone made it genuinely poignant.
