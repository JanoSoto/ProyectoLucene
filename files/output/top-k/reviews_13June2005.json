[{"date":"13 June 2005","score":"","review":" Rounders is a movie that proceeded the poker craze that has swept this nation. When it came out in 1998, it was a mild success, but now has a cult following as college kids and others discover they like to play poker after seeing it on TV for the past couple of years. Matt Damon plays Mike McDermott, a law school student who finds he's a wizard when it comes to playing poker. He's good, but lost one big hand to Teddy KGB (John Malkovich) and lost it all, leading to his retirement from the game. His girlfriend Jo (Gretchen Mol) is the one who convinces him to stay away from the poker tables, and is the one who loses faith in Mike when he starts to play again. Mike's retirement only lasts as long as his friend Worm, played wonderfully by Ed Norton, stays in jail. Upon Worm's exit from jail, debts need to be paid. Ed Norton is able to make his character so unlikeable that we feel bad for him and the others who are risking it all to help Worm out. Damon does a solid job of being the good poker player who thinks he can beat the house every time he walks up to a table. Martin Landau also makes an appearance as Mike's college mentor, channeling a thick Yiddish accent that lead me to recall his work as Bela Legosi in Ed Wood. Landau's job in Rounders is to be the Yoda to Mike's Luke Skywalker, dispensing sage advice about destiny and helping Mike save his life. The movie ends in a way that elevate poker from a mathematical numbers game to a psychological battle, the way the game is meant to be played. The poker craze has been mostly online, where playing the percentages is the way people win. When sitting down at a table, on the other hand, not only are the numbers important, but mental combat can lead to winning and losing, and Rounders was able to show this brilliantly. The non-serious poker fan will enjoy the movie as a good guys vs. the bad guys story. The serious poker fan, on the other hand, will really like this movie, as the game is shown for what it is, but also shows the risks of stepping up to the big boys' tables and there are cameos by some of poker's greatest players. And, thankfully, no Ben Affleck in this movie either. ","genre":null},{"date":"13 June 2005","score":"","review":" Rounders is a movie that proceeded the poker craze that has swept this nation.
