It has scenes as quick witted - and often as wackily off-kilter! - as the adults must be just in order to survive their average day. Stir love into this mess of two increasingly desparate modern lives and you get a miraculous souffle of a film, at once sharp and sweet.No scene is laboured, no point is telegraphed, and - phenomenally for a modern American film - neither kids nor kittens are allowed to smother the audience in the nauseous layers of cutesiness that are usually applied. The scene with the analyst, where Clooney must obscure his account of his sex-life in an ever-more-surrealistic periphrasis involving iced cakes and fish, since his little daughter has to accompany him into the presumably crecheless analyst's surgery, and her dad is embarassed to expose her to such adult matters as he is obliged to reveal during the session, is a scene which is a model of intelligent and stylish comedy writing. The dialogue of both himself and his analyst finally founders on the increasingly strained comparisons and metaphors being attempted. The analyst begins to construct an alarmingly kinky lifestyle for his client out of what he takes to be Freudian suggestions - but which are, as noted, merely the product of old-fashioned seemliness - whereupon Clooney is forced to bring the whole towering edifice back down to earth when his version of the morning's business with the goldfish gets mixed up in the heady brew of symbolism 'No. I mean fish. You know - 'Fish' fish?'The humour is all good, never strained, and beautifully played by all the principals, including the wonderfully un-sentimentalised children. The transformation, stage-by-stage, of the harsh mutual competition and resentment that exists at first between these harassed adults, into an exhausted truce, by way of barely-restrained irritation, grudging gratitude, reluctant respect, and growing affection, is handled with considerable dramatic finesse throughout.To produce the unlikely union of such an ill-assorted pair under such utterly unpropitious and unromantic circumstances is a comedic challenge of considerable proportions, and the makers of this film do an excellent job to bring it off at all. The spirits of Grant and Hepburn - even Beatrice and Benedict - are not too far away.The only disappointment is to see how many people in the audience have gone home just as sour as when they arrived, judging from some of the comments here. But then, love curdles in any mean-spirited breast.One particularly admires the fact that, at its conclusion, the film's romantic clincher - when the tired-out couple have to settle for just falling asleep together, despite their by now clearly desparate need for each other, - insists upon the importance of exactly this Love, rather than merely lust, as the basis for an adult relationship.Just occasionally, Hollywood still lets us have a grown-up entertainment.

The story begins when Louis (Brad Pitt), a vampire finds an interviewer (Christian sLater) and leads him to his room to tell him his story. The story starts in the 18th century in New Orleans when Louis after a terrible loss in his family (in the film it is implied that he lost his wife and his newborn child but in the book it's his brother that commits suicide) starts to be obsessed with death himself.  He then meets a vampire, LeStat (Tom Cruise) who gives him the opportunity to become a vampire, experience what he longed for, which was death, yet still live forever. Louis who was so eager to die finds the lifestyle of the vampires unbearable and in the first time in his life starts to value human life.  He starts to hate LeStat for being so senseless and killing everyone and everything he can get his hands on and retreats to eating mouse and other small animals to survive because he can't find the strength to kill a human being. His disgust for LeStat becomes so strong that he is about to leave him when LeStat turns a 5 year old orphan, Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) that Louis had fed on but didn't have the courage to kill her, into a vampire.  Louis will then stay with LeStat and will become a father to Claudia. As Claudia grows up her relationship with Louis becomes much stronger as they still sleep in the same coffin and she demands to know the truth of how she became a vampire and why she will never have the body of a full-grown woman.  Louis tells her the truth which angers her so much that she is willing to take revenge from LeStat.  I won't say anything else because I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but I'll just say that the relationship between Louis and Claudia becomes much stronger after being together for almost a century until an ancient vampire, Armand (Antonio Banderas) and his attraction to Louis, which by the way is mutual, is putting the couple's love in danger. Some might think that the relationship between Louis and Claudia, a 24 year old man and a 5 year old girl is gross but it isn't because vampires are not sexual beings and besides, Claudia despite her diminutive stature is technically 100 years old when they kiss in Paris.  Others might be bothered by the attraction between Louis and Armand or even between LeStat and Louis but I want to believe that our society is able to accept homosexuality even if the attraction between the vampires is by no means sexual, since vampires as I have already said are not sexual beings. There are a lot more I'd like to say about this film but there's really no reason to do such a thing in a review. Interview with the Vampire is a fascinating and heart-breaking story and one of the best stories about the vampire's eternal pain and their internal struggles between their morals and their needs.

They throw punch lines and verbal digs back and forth, and we suspect that any minute one of them will jump through the other end of the phone, slap each other, and then embrace passionately. We know they are going to get together, we sit and wait and sit and wait, just waiting, and the film drags on just about twenty minutes too long - and then they finally kiss as the kids watch The Wizard of Oz in a nearby bedroom, and then she goes to freshen up, and when she comes back he is asleep on the sofa, and so she falls asleep next to him, and then we pull up towards the night view of a backlit New York City with the image of two children watching their parents asleep on a sofa, giggling and laughing. The first thing I thought\/pondered is Those kids look up to no good, they're probably going to take their parents' credit cards and order gallons of ice cream and stay up all night watching R-rated movies.

In the direction of the movie AND the writing of the screenplay, itself, he acquired the title Magus beyond question. Kubrick's genius is like magic.  The movie world lost a great director when he died in 1999.  Among his other outstanding credits are  Eyes Wide Shut, 1999;  Full Metal Jacket, 1987; Barry Lyndon, 1975; A Clockwork Orange, 1971; 2001 A Space Odyssey, 1968; Spartacus, 1960 and many more.The Torrences (Jack, Wendy his wife and Danny, their son) are living in the Overlook Hotel for the winter; Jack has been hired as the caretaker.  It is his job to oversee the upkeep of the hotel during the several months of hard snow, until spring when the Overlook reopens its doors.  It seems there are many wealthy and jaded tourists who will flock to the Colorado Mountains for a snow-filled summer getaway.The Hotel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging.  It lent to the atmosphere, by having a dark, yet at the same time welcoming atmosphere, itself.  The furnishings and furniture was all period (late 70's - early 80's), and the filmography of the landscape approaching the hotel in the opening scene is brilliant. It not only lets you enjoy the approach to the Overlook,  it also fixes in your mind how deserted and isolated the Hotel is from the rest of the world.The introduction of Wendy and Danny's characters was a stroke of genius.  You get the whole story of their past, Danny's imaginary friend, Tony, and the story of Jack's alcoholism all rolled into this nice, neat introductory scene.  There was no need in stretching the past history out over two hours of the movie; obviously, Kubrick saw that from the beginning.Closing Day.  Again, the scenic drive up the mountains to the Hotel (this time, with family in tow), the interaction between Jack and Danny was hilarious while also portraying a very disturbing exchange.The initial tour through the Overlook is quite breathtaking, even as the staff is moving things out, you get a chance to see the majestic fire places, the high cathedral ceilings and expensive furnishings, dormants and crown moldings in the architecture. They did a good job!  Pink and gold are my favorite colors. (Wendy Torrence)  Even the staff wing is well designed and beautifully built.The maze was a magnificent touch, reminiscent of the Labyrinth in which the Minotaur of Crete was Guardian.  When Jack Nicholson stands at the scaled model of the maze and stares into the center, seeing Wendy and Danny entering, it's a magickal moment; one that tells you right away, there are heavy energies in that house; there's something seriously wrong, already starting.  I wouldn't want to go in there unless I had at least an hour to find my way out. (The Hotel Manager)Scatman Cruthers, as Dick Halloran, was genuine and open in his performance.  His smiles were natural and his performance was wonderful.  You could actually believe you were there in the hotel, taking the tour of the kitchen with Wendy and Doc.  His explanation of the shining to Danny was very well delivered, as was his conversation with the child about Tony and the Hotel.  It was believable and sincere.The cut out and pan scan of the hotel itself, with the mountains looming behind, the cold air swirling about, mist coming up from the warm roof of the snowbound hotel, adds so MUCH to the atmosphere of the movie.  It also marks the half-way-to-hell point, so to speak; the turning point in the movie.Shelley Duvall's portrayal of Wendy Torrence was masterful.  (So WHAT if she also played Olive Oyl?!  It just shows her marvelous diversity!)  Honestly, before I saw the movie on the big screen in 1980, I said, What?  Olive Oyl?  *lol*  (Popeye was also released in 1980.)  But I took that back as soon as the movie started.  She's brilliant.   In this Fiend's opinion, this is her best performance, to date!  (Although I did love her in Steve Martin's Roxanne, 1987.)Once Kubrick has established the pearly bits of information of which you, the viewer, need to be in possession  the Torrence's past; Danny's broken arm; Tony;  the history of the Hotel itself; the fact that Danny is not mental, but rather clairvoyant instead, and the general layout of the Hotel; all of which you get in the opening 3 sequences; the movie never stops scaring you.The two butchered daughters of the previous caretaker, Delbert Grady (the girls having appeared several times to Danny, first by way of Tony in the apartment before the family ever left for the hotel) were icons with which Danny could identify, and of which he was afraid, at the same time.  They were haunting (and haunted), themselves and showed Danny how and where they were killed, in a rather graphic and material way.Kubrick's Tony was written as an attendant spirit, like a spirit guide which he acquired as a result of his arm nearly being wrenched off his body by his own father.  He was...the little boy who lives in my mouth.  He would manifest in the end of Danny's finger and physically spoke through Danny in order to speak TO Danny.  NOT like in the book, I realize, where Tony was intended by Stephen King to be the projection of Danny as an older boy, trying to save his father.  Kubrick left out that little twist and it somehow made it more frightening when Tony took ... Danny ... over.  The idea of Danny's older self projecting back to his younger self isn't...scary.The Woman in the Shower scene, done by Lia Beldan (about whom I can find no other credits for having done anything before, or since) as the younger woman and Billie Gibson (who ALSO appears to suffer from a lack of credits for works before or since), was seductively obnoxious and thoroughly disgusting.  It was dramatic, and frightening.  Abhorrent and scary.  When Nicholson looks into the mirror and sees her decomposing flesh beneath his hands; the look of sheer terror on his face was so complete and REAL.Jack quickly embarks on his trek from  the jonesing alcoholic to a certifiable insane person.  The degradation of his character's mental state is carefully and thoroughly documented by Kubrick. Jack's instant friendship with Lloyd the Bartender (as only alcoholics, would-be mental patients and drug addicts do) portrays his pressing NEED of the atmosphere to which Lloyd avails him; namely, alcohol ...hair of the dog that bit me. (Jack Torrence)  In Jack's case, it's bourbon on the rocks, at no charge to Jack.  Orders from the house.  (Lloyd the Bartender)  Nice play on words.When Wendy find's Jack's screenplay is nothing more than page after page of the same line typed over and over, albeit in 8 or 9 different creative styles...when he asks from the shadows, How do you like it? and Wendy whirls and screams with the baseball bat in her hand...is so poignant.  It's the point where she realizes how messed up the whole situation is...how messed up Jack is. It's very scary, dramatic and delivers a strong presence.  That coupled with Danny's visions of the hotel lobby filling with blood, imposed over the scene between Jack and Wendy, and with the confrontational ending to this scene, make this possibly THE strongest scene of the movie.The REDRUM scene.  Wow.  What do I say?  What mother would not be totally freaked by awakening to find their young, troubled son standing over them with a huge knife, talking in that freaky little voice, exclaiming REDRUM over and over?  Even if it HAD no meaning, it would still be as scary as the 7th level of HELL.  It was something everyone could (and has) remember(ed).  Speaking of memorable scenes...Nicholson's final assault on his family with an axe was perhaps one of the scariest scenes of movie history.  His ad-libbed line, Heeeeere's Johnny! was a stroke of brilliance and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror.  It also goes down in horror movie history.The ending..?  Kubrick's ending was perfection.  I felt it ended beautifully.  No smarm, no platitudinous whining, no tearfully idiotic ending for THIS movie.  Just epitomized perfection.  That's all I'll say on the subject of the ending.Who cares what was taken out?!  Look what Kubrick put IN.  Rent it, watch it, BUY IT.  It's a classic in the horror genre, and for good reason.  IT RAWKS!!*Me being Me* ... Take this movie, and sitck it in your Stephen King collection, and take the 1997 Authorized version done by King and stick it down in the kiddie section.

It lent to the atmosphere, by having a dark, yet at the same time welcoming atmosphere, itself.  The furnishings and furniture was all period (late 70's - early 80's), and the filmography of the landscape approaching the hotel in the opening scene is brilliant. It not only lets you enjoy the approach to the Overlook,  it also fixes in your mind how deserted and isolated the Hotel is from the rest of the world.The introduction of Wendy and Danny's characters was a stroke of genius.  You get the whole story of their past, Danny's imaginary friend, Tony, and the story of Jack's alcoholism all rolled into this nice, neat introductory scene.  There was no need in stretching the past history out over two hours of the movie; obviously, Kubrick saw that from the beginning.Closing Day.  Again, the scenic drive up the mountains to the Hotel (this time, with family in tow), the interaction between Jack and Danny was hilarious while also portraying a very disturbing exchange.The initial tour through the Overlook is quite breathtaking, even as the staff is moving things out, you get a chance to see the majestic fire places, the high cathedral ceilings and expensive furnishings, dormants and crown moldings in the architecture. They did a good job!  Pink and gold are my favorite colors. (Wendy Torrence)  Even the staff wing is well designed and beautifully built.The maze was a magnificent touch, reminiscent of the Labyrinth in which the Minotaur of Crete was Guardian.  When Jack Nicholson stands at the scaled model of the maze and stares into the center, seeing Wendy and Danny entering, it's a magickal moment; one that tells you right away, there are heavy energies in that house; there's something seriously wrong, already starting.  I wouldn't want to go in there unless I had at least an hour to find my way out. (The Hotel Manager)Scatman Cruthers, as Dick Halloran, was genuine and open in his performance.  His smiles were natural and his performance was wonderful.  You could actually believe you were there in the hotel, taking the tour of the kitchen with Wendy and Doc.  His explanation of the shining to Danny was very well delivered, as was his conversation with the child about Tony and the Hotel.  It was believable and sincere.The cut out and pan scan of the hotel itself, with the mountains looming behind, the cold air swirling about, mist coming up from the warm roof of the snowbound hotel, adds so MUCH to the atmosphere of the movie.  It also marks the half-way-to-hell point, so to speak; the turning point in the movie.Shelley Duvall's portrayal of Wendy Torrence was masterful.  (So WHAT if she also played Olive Oyl?!  It just shows her marvelous diversity!)  Honestly, before I saw the movie on the big screen in 1980, I said, What?  Olive Oyl?  *lol*  (Popeye was also released in 1980.)  But I took that back as soon as the movie started.  She's brilliant.   In this Fiend's opinion, this is her best performance, to date!  (Although I did love her in Steve Martin's Roxanne, 1987.)Once Kubrick has established the pearly bits of information of which you, the viewer, need to be in possession  the Torrence's past; Danny's broken arm; Tony;  the history of the Hotel itself; the fact that Danny is not mental, but rather clairvoyant instead, and the general layout of the Hotel; all of which you get in the opening 3 sequences; the movie never stops scaring you.The two butchered daughters of the previous caretaker, Delbert Grady (the girls having appeared several times to Danny, first by way of Tony in the apartment before the family ever left for the hotel) were icons with which Danny could identify, and of which he was afraid, at the same time.  They were haunting (and haunted), themselves and showed Danny how and where they were killed, in a rather graphic and material way.Kubrick's Tony was written as an attendant spirit, like a spirit guide which he acquired as a result of his arm nearly being wrenched off his body by his own father.  He was...the little boy who lives in my mouth.  He would manifest in the end of Danny's finger and physically spoke through Danny in order to speak TO Danny.  NOT like in the book, I realize, where Tony was intended by Stephen King to be the projection of Danny as an older boy, trying to save his father.  Kubrick left out that little twist and it somehow made it more frightening when Tony took ... Danny ... over.  The idea of Danny's older self projecting back to his younger self isn't...scary.The Woman in the Shower scene, done by Lia Beldan (about whom I can find no other credits for having done anything before, or since) as the younger woman and Billie Gibson (who ALSO appears to suffer from a lack of credits for works before or since), was seductively obnoxious and thoroughly disgusting.  It was dramatic, and frightening.  Abhorrent and scary.  When Nicholson looks into the mirror and sees her decomposing flesh beneath his hands; the look of sheer terror on his face was so complete and REAL.Jack quickly embarks on his trek from  the jonesing alcoholic to a certifiable insane person.  The degradation of his character's mental state is carefully and thoroughly documented by Kubrick. Jack's instant friendship with Lloyd the Bartender (as only alcoholics, would-be mental patients and drug addicts do) portrays his pressing NEED of the atmosphere to which Lloyd avails him; namely, alcohol ...hair of the dog that bit me. (Jack Torrence)  In Jack's case, it's bourbon on the rocks, at no charge to Jack.  Orders from the house.  (Lloyd the Bartender)  Nice play on words.When Wendy find's Jack's screenplay is nothing more than page after page of the same line typed over and over, albeit in 8 or 9 different creative styles...when he asks from the shadows, How do you like it? and Wendy whirls and screams with the baseball bat in her hand...is so poignant.  It's the point where she realizes how messed up the whole situation is...how messed up Jack is. It's very scary, dramatic and delivers a strong presence.  That coupled with Danny's visions of the hotel lobby filling with blood, imposed over the scene between Jack and Wendy, and with the confrontational ending to this scene, make this possibly THE strongest scene of the movie.The REDRUM scene.  Wow.  What do I say?  What mother would not be totally freaked by awakening to find their young, troubled son standing over them with a huge knife, talking in that freaky little voice, exclaiming REDRUM over and over?  Even if it HAD no meaning, it would still be as scary as the 7th level of HELL.  It was something everyone could (and has) remember(ed).  Speaking of memorable scenes...Nicholson's final assault on his family with an axe was perhaps one of the scariest scenes of movie history.  His ad-libbed line, Heeeeere's Johnny! was a stroke of brilliance and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror.  It also goes down in horror movie history.The ending..?  Kubrick's ending was perfection.  I felt it ended beautifully.  No smarm, no platitudinous whining, no tearfully idiotic ending for THIS movie.  Just epitomized perfection.  That's all I'll say on the subject of the ending.Who cares what was taken out?!  Look what Kubrick put IN.  Rent it, watch it, BUY IT.  It's a classic in the horror genre, and for good reason.  IT RAWKS!!*Me being Me* ... Take this movie, and sitck it in your Stephen King collection, and take the 1997 Authorized version done by King and stick it down in the kiddie section.  That's where it belongs. . This movie rates a 9.98 from the Fiend .

The movie itself is not that bad, though it is incredibly unbelievable the way the adults in this movie react to what goes on around them. Why is it adults never seem to understand what's going on in these kinds of movies? The characters are what they are but unlike other horror movies, they actually try to flesh them out a little bit. I actually grew fond of the main group of kids because they were presented, albeit clumsily, to be more than just salami for Freddy's knives to cut up. Also, I related to them in a couple of ways, now that I'm older but I'll save the sob stories for yo' mama!We also get to find out exactly how Freddy came to be and it always helps to know a little bit more than you should about child killers, no? It's also a pleasure to see Heather Lagenkamp and John Saxon reprising their roles from the first one. Heather comes off looking like she should've been doing soaps after this but that's just my opinion. There's also some cameos from people you wouldn't expect. (Dick Cavett?!) The dream sequences are a bit less claustrophobic than they were in the first two, which is kind of a drag. The story does add a bit of a fantastical element to them and they're pretty fun to watch. The movie is never really scary but thankfully it's never really boring. The special effects were pretty good for it's time and they still hold up for the most part.This is the Freddy that sticks out the rest of the series, the joking, obvious latex make-up Freddy. So from here on out, I think it's safe to say that my retrospective viewing of the Nightmare series is about to get painful. As for this installment, I'd say that it's definitely one of the better films of the series. And Freddy gets some good one liners in. Whether or not that's a good thing is up to you.Rating ***1\/2 out of *****.

Released with hardly a whisper, HALLOWEEN was brushed off by Variety as routine drive-in fare.  But when it opened in New York City, a prescient critic for the Village Voice gave it a rave review.  The rest is history. Less than two years later, another independent filmmaker chose another holiday with eerie connotations, FRIDAY THE 13TH.  Although crudely done, derivative and awash in gore (by comparison, HALLOWEEN was virtually blood-free), the film delivered the shuddery goods. Unfortunately, the boxoffice blockbuster status of HALLOWEEN and FRIDAY THE 13TH--the first a certifiable classic, the second a cynical piece of trash--spawned a torrent of ripoffs. Most of them were miniscule-budgeted independent quickies, but an alarming number of them were reasonably financed, even bearing the distribution logo of a respected major-studio, with the added come-on of a Stephen King novel serving as its source. (This hybrid was generally as wretched as its independent counterparts.)  But King didn't come cheap; actors did.  After her quintet of screamfests, Jamie Lee Curtis, the then-unknown star of HALLOWEEN, cannily figured she'd paid her dues and moved into other ventures.  Poor, pretty Adrienne King, who played the Curtis-role in FRIDAY THE 13TH, didn't fare as well.  After demanding a salary raise for the sequel, Ms. King found herself relegated to a pre-credit cameo. Among the dozens of clones that polluted theatres for the next decade, however (and the sequels to HALLOWEEN and FRIDAY THE 13TH are now entering their third decade), one movie of genuine quality emerged--only to be somewhat buried (and sadly underrated) by the morass of slasher flicks that tarnished the '80s.  That film is CHRISTINE, a 1983 release that is as finely crafted, meticulously assembled, and gripping a thriller to come out of Hollywood since the output of Val Lewton (Cat People, The Seventh Victim) in his all-too-brief 1940s heyday. Yes, CHRISTINE was based on a Stephen King novel but its makers had the intelligence to cut out the novel's dreck, retain its haunting premise, and embellish its virtues. CHRISTINE is the name a bullied, lonely highschool nerd Arnie (Keith Gordon) gives to a battered 1958 Plymouth Fury he acquires at a used-car garage. Obviously feeling a psychological kinship with the abandoned vehicle, Arnie becomes obsessed with restoring the neglected car to its former gleaming red glory.  But as Christine's outward appearance undergoes a transformation thanks to Arnie's loving care, so does Arnie's. As his sole friend and protector, the warm-hearted, concerned school jock Dennis (John Stockwell, giving depth and quiet strength to a usually cliched character) looks on at first in bemusement, then in increasing alarm as Arnie is gradually transformed into an intimidating, kick-butt stud.  Moreover, Dennis takes notice of Arnie's increasing dependence, almost supernatural obsession with his beloved Christine.  But Christine has a mind of her own, including jealousy.  First, anyone who crosses Arnie's path is found mysteriously slain.  Then, when the highschool beauty (Alexandra Paul, years before her Baywatch days) becomes attracted to the newly refurbished Arnie, Christine swings into a jealous rampage and . . . CHRISTINE evokes its sense of dread by casting a searingly keen eye on the sights and sounds of small-town life, of carefully depicted relationships between teenagers and their parents, and the casual caring and cruelties of highschool life.  The film entirely eschews gore, cheap shocks and CGI special effects, and focuses almost imperceptibly on our most primal fears and joys--of growing up, of falling in love, the anguish of betrayal and abandonment--all the while with Christine observing all that transpires from the background--and zooming into the foreground when it comes to protecting her savior. Director John Carpenter's devious stylistic gifts quietly prick at our nerves--all is nuance (enhanced by a furtively roaming anamorphic Panaglide camera). CHRISTINE creates moments of such suspense that it reminded me of a few other unique thrillers of its era--and, by cross-referencing various movies (on IMDB) that came to mind, I was surprised that all shared one connecting link. First the films SOMEONE'S WATCHING ME, a truly unnerving made-for-TV thriller starring Lauren Hutton as a woman terrorized in her swank high-rise apartment. This little-known gem was written and directed by John Carpenter prior to HALLOWEEN. SALEM'S LOT, Tobe Hooper's 2-part TV adaptation of Stephen King's vampire shocker, released theatrically overseas, featuring one of James Mason's last, most memorable performances. Wes Craven's CHILLER, made-for-TV before the filmmaker went on to commercial success with the Elm Street and Scream franchises. This top-quality trilogy--plus CHRISTINE--were all produced by Richard Kobritz.  His two Stephen King adaptations show he seems to understand and enhance King's work as no other filmmaker has to date, though many have tried and come a cropper (check out both versions of THE SHINING, Kubrick's bloated theatrical version and the tacky TV mini-series, and you'll see what I'm talking about). In an era when directors are instantly credited as the auteurs of their films, I'd suggest that the films of Mr. Kobritz--not unlike those of Val Lewton--show who the genuine auteur is.  In all of his films, the sense of foreboding is evoked through the subtlest of psychological and cinematic terms.  Somehow, these films all have the same unique touch.  In all of the endings, the presence of evil is never entirely vanquished.  As in life, evil is always lurking, waiting to make its inevitable return in some form or other. I congratulate Mr. Kobritz for being perhaps the sole filmmaker to have learned the lessons of Lewton.

I mean who wouldn't be? Branaugh, Smith, Kline, Hayek, Sonnenfeld; how could it miss? My sister saw it first, and although I usually value her opinion on films, there have been exceptions, so I overlooked her advice and went to see for myself. This is one of the few times I wish I'd listened to my sister.In my opinion there are a handful of movie categories; great, good, not good but has redeeming qualities (ie cinematography or editing), fluffy fun, barely worth the effort, and NEVER should've happened. I had to add the last category when I saw WWW. What a waste of some brilliant talent. Branaugh's character was impossible to redeem. His dialogue was way too cheesy, his manner inexplicable. Kline and Smith don't fare any better. While there is the occasional joke that plays off, they are to few and far between to even rate this as not good but has redeeming qualities. The story was beyond stupid, the 'plot twists' could only be laughing referred to as such. The entire range of dialogue was sickening. Oddly one of the few scenes worth the time for me, is the one most hated in general. It's the verbal sparring match between Branaugh and Smith, with the non-PC references. They were offensive, but that was the entire point. If they had used that take, being funny without trying to pander to political correctness, through the film they might've made something worth $8.50. Instead it looks like they tried too hard to be PG-13 with most of the comedy. In addition, the effects were pathetic, the cinematography (which at least should've been good based on the time they were working with) was parochial at best, and even the costumes seemed annoying. Overall this movie was a majorly failed attempt, and an unforgiveable waste of some of our best comedic performers.
