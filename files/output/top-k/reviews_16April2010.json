I first saw his 1987 film, Planes, Trains & Automobiles starring John Candy and Steve Martin, in 2006, and thought it was a great comedy. I watched it for the second time late last year, over three years after my first viewing, and this didn't change anything. Uncle Buck is another movie written, directed, and produced by Hughes and starring Candy, both of whom are sadly no longer with us. I had known about this film for quite a while by the time I finally saw it, and I wasn't expecting it to be as good as the 1987 movie, which it isn't, but it was still enough to leave me with a good feeling.Bob and Cindy Russell recently moved from Indianapolis to Chicago with their three offspring, Miles and Maizy, who are both under ten years old, and Tia, who is now a teenager. Cindy is informed that her father has just had a heart attack, so she and her husband plan to go to Indianapolis to visit the ailing man, but first, they will have to find a sitter for their kids. After several failed attempts, it seems they have no choice but to call over Bob's unmarried brother, Buck Russell to take the job, even though he is a lazy, irresponsible slob, which means this could lead to disaster! Nonetheless, Buck agrees to come over and stay with Miles, Maizy, and Tia while his brother and sister-in-law are in Indianapolis. Inevitably, his presence in this household does lead to some trouble, especially with Tia. She does not appreciate her uncle's presence and is currently going through a phase of teen angst and rebelliousness.At the beginning of this movie, it's not all that great. When Tia (played by Jean Louisa Kelly) first appears, it doesn't take long for one to realize that she is a very unlikable, snotty character, though there are some fairly funny lines in that very early scene with the Russell siblings. I also didn't think Macaulay Culkin (in the role of Miles Russell) talking about a certain dog being a ball-sniffer that funny. However, as I had hoped, John Candy does a great job playing the title role. He plays the same kind of character here as he did in Planes, Trains & Automobiles, a lovable slob. I think his talent really helps carry this film, and his character's antics are probably the main reason why so much of it is funny, with the slapstick and comical dialogue. Around the time when the character leaves his apartment and goes to the family's house, I was laughing very hard, with scenes such as his phone conversation before he leaves and Buck knocking on the wrong door when he arrives. If it stayed this way for the rest of the film, I would be giving it at least an 8\/10, but it doesn't. Tia continues to be snotty, and for much of the film, I laughed a lot but not as hard as before, but Candy's antics still make much of this film entertaining, sometimes hilarious, with the lead character annoying Tia, scaring her boyfriend, the explosion sound his car engine makes, his conversation with the elementary assistant principal, etc. It helps that there are also some good dramatic moments in the movie, especially towards the end.Basically, what makes this flick inferior to Planes, Trains & Automobiles is that it's not as consistent as its predecessor, and the 1987 John Hughes\/John Candy collaboration certainly doesn't have any characters that are as off-putting as the Tia character is here. In between those two films, Hughes wrote but didn't direct a comedy entitled The Great Outdoors, which also features Candy in the cast, but I haven't seen that one, so I don't know how it compares, but Planes, Trains & Automobiles and Uncle Buck are both funny comedies which can also be serious in some scenes, with good sentiment, and Candy really stands out in both of them. The two movies can also easily leave viewers with a good feeling at the end. I can understand why Uncle Buck doesn't have the appeal of its hilarious predecessor, but there is a lot to make it watchable, and it can remind us of the talent Hughes and Candy had.

This is the one with the annoying young American figure skater, Topol, and the opening helicopter sequence with Blofeld (his final appearance in the films).FOR YOUR EYES ONLY has just about everything you could want in a Bond movie. We get to see a car chase, some underwater battles, various winter Olympic sports (including battles on a ski jump ramp and hockey rink, and a memorable downhill chase), rock climbing, an out-of-control helicopter, and exotic locations. (Much of the action takes place in Greece.) We even get a scene of Bond playing cards and an appearance from Bond's arch-nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld (head of SPECTRE). As always there's the beautiful female sidekick (Carole Bouquet), the amusing gadgets of Q Lab, and Miss Moneypenny. The great Topol (FIDDLER ON THE ROOF) joins the ranks of James Bond's colorful allies.It seems that FOR YOUR EYES ONLY takes bits and pieces from earlier Bond films and stirs them together to make an exciting new adventure for 1981 audiences. For instance, there's a reference to Mrs. James Bond, from ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE (1969). Blofeld, an important villain in earlier films, makes a brief cameo in his first appearance since DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER (1971) a decade earlier, and in what would be his final appearance in the series. The scuba-diving scenes call to mind THUNDERBALL (1965). The woman out to avenge her family is an element taken from GOLDFINGER (1964). Bond's card playing comes from such films as DR. NO (1962). Even the skiing has been done before, in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and THE SPY WHO LOVED ME (1977).The theme song is sung by Sheena Easton, who has the distinction of being the only singer to be shown during the opening titles of a James Bond film. The music in the film has a sort of '80s pop feel. Bond's car, a Lotus, also looks terribly dated nowadays. (It's no Aston Martin.)In this Cold War espionage adventure James Bond travels around Europe to keep a military device out of enemy hands. Roger Moore has his fair share of one-liners, but the director makes a conscious effort to move the story in a more serious direction than some of the previous films. It has a slightly hard-boiled edge (at times). The action is more grounded, in that Bond must rely on his wits and his combat skills to save the day, rather than some wild and wacky gadgets.FOR YOUR EYES ONLY is #12 in the James Bond series, and is the fifth film to star Roger Moore as 007. While far from my favorite Bond movie, this one is still alright. It has its moments. I wasn't really a fan of the opening Blofeld\/helicopter sequence and I didn't care for the figure skater character. But the scenery is beautiful (Greece!), Topol is great in a supporting role, Bouquet is lovely as the exotic Bond girl, and the action set-pieces are pretty imaginative (a skier and a motorcyclist on a bobsled track?).Not one of the best or most thought-provoking Bonds, but it's a nice escapist adventure. Like most Bond films, it has its ups and its downs.

Roger Moore has his fair share of one-liners, but the director makes a conscious effort to move the story in a more serious direction than some of the previous films. It has a slightly hard-boiled edge (at times). The action is more grounded, in that Bond must rely on his wits and his combat skills to save the day, rather than some wild and wacky gadgets.FOR YOUR EYES ONLY is #12 in the James Bond series, and is the fifth film to star Roger Moore as 007. While far from my favorite Bond movie, this one is still alright. It has its moments. I wasn't really a fan of the opening Blofeld\/helicopter sequence and I didn't care for the figure skater character. But the scenery is beautiful (Greece!), Topol is great in a supporting role, Bouquet is lovely as the exotic Bond girl, and the action set-pieces are pretty imaginative (a skier and a motorcyclist on a bobsled track?).Not one of the best or most thought-provoking Bonds, but it's a nice escapist adventure.

This is the one with the annoying young American figure skater, Topol, and the opening helicopter sequence with Blofeld (his final appearance in the films).FOR YOUR EYES ONLY has just about everything you could want in a Bond movie. We get to see a car chase, some underwater battles, various winter Olympic sports (including battles on a ski jump ramp and hockey rink, and a memorable downhill chase), rock climbing, an out-of-control helicopter, and exotic locations. (Much of the action takes place in Greece.) We even get a scene of Bond playing cards and an appearance from Bond's arch-nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld (head of SPECTRE). As always there's the beautiful female sidekick (Carole Bouquet), the amusing gadgets of Q Lab, and Miss Moneypenny. The great Topol (FIDDLER ON THE ROOF) joins the ranks of James Bond's colorful allies.It seems that FOR YOUR EYES ONLY takes bits and pieces from earlier Bond films and stirs them together to make an exciting new adventure for 1981 audiences. For instance, there's a reference to Mrs. James Bond, from ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE (1969).

In 1992 they finished their second one, Je pense à vous (I Think About You) which they didn't think as a good film. After four years, came their first real Dardenne-film The Promise. It was the first film where they found their own unique style. The Promise is a story of a father son relationship, which they had already dealt with in Falsch.Roger (Olivier Gourmet), with his 15-year-old son Igor (Jérémie Renier), drives across industrial Belgium to get illegal immigrants from a truck. They bring them back to a block of flats they live in and start charging them for money. One of the immigrants is Assita who has come to Belgium with her husband to find a better future for them and their baby. One day when immigrant-inspectors pay a visit events start to have radical consequences.The films by the Dardenne brothers usually focus on the moral choices the characters have to make and what are the consequences. In The Promise Igor has to decide, whether to obey his father or to do what's right and help Assita. Then we get to the question what is the right thing to do? And this is what Luc & Jean-Pierre Dardenne want to do let us observe and think. Luc Dardenne has said that the basic idea of film-making is to reconstruct new humane experiences. The Promise makes one think about these moral dilemmas and social issues but also associate the events with one's own life.Geographically Belgium is in between of Germany and France - Belgium is only a country for trespassing. For instance a harsh example; Hitler in WWII. This is the main theme of The Promise - it is a story of trespassing. For Assita Belgium is a metaphor of a certain state in life, which she is just passing by. No one stays in Belgium (or in that state of life).As is Assita in between of two worlds; her home country and Belgium, so is Igor. Igor feels himself grown-up when he's collecting taxes for his father and driving around Belgium. But on the other hand he's full of juvenile joy as he drives with his friends on a go-kart. Igor was played by Jérémie Renier (L 'Enfant, Lorna's Silence). It was his first role and through that he brought a realistic life to the character who tries to free himself from the chains of his father - the brothers have always appreciated the idea of using amateur actors. Igor's father, Roger was played by the Golden Palm-winner Olivier Gourmet, who is in my opinion a very talented actor. He gives a great life to Roger, whose world is worthless and merciless.The Dardenne brothers were raised in an industrial town in Belgium, which is the milieu in all of their films. The sound scape is something that one should pay attention to. There's no musical score at all only the voices the characters hear, the voices of an industrial town - ambiance. In the end the industrial voices just keep going on as the credits come on the screen. It's like we can't handle them anymore, they're spreading off the screen. A bit like in Chaplin's City Lights.The minimalist style of The Promise is amazing. It's touching on a new level. The brothers have totally succeed in their mission to create new humane experiences. Luc Dardenne writes in his 'diary' Behind Our Pictures, that the more you take material away the closer you get to the humane emotions, which he achieves through the severe aesthetics, minimalism and ruthless sound scape.Faces are in an important role, when describing humane emotions in The Promise the faces have also a dramaturgical role. I'm going to quote Luc Dardenne here, translated in English In every scene with Igor and Assita where they look to each other, Igor is always the first to turn his head away. Igor isn't able to meet Assita's eyes, because he senses a moral command that he cannot reply. Except in the final scene. And what a redemption it is in the end. The meaning of facial expressions and the philosophy behind it comes from a French philosopher Emmanuel Lévinas, who both of the brothers admire and from whom they get background for their philosophy of film.The Promise is thinking - philosophy of film. The brothers have stabilized film as an instrument for philosophy. I hope that the true film fanatics get to see this and appreciate it as much as I do. In addition to its themes of change, father-son relationship and trespassing, The Promise challenges the viewer to think on its own. The brothers force us to meet the moral choices out there.

Luc Dardenne writes in his 'diary' Behind Our Pictures, that the more you take material away the closer you get to the humane emotions, which he achieves through the severe aesthetics, minimalism and ruthless sound scape.Faces are in an important role, when describing humane emotions in The Promise the faces have also a dramaturgical role. I'm going to quote Luc Dardenne here, translated in English In every scene with Igor and Assita where they look to each other, Igor is always the first to turn his head away. Igor isn't able to meet Assita's eyes, because he senses a moral command that he cannot reply. Except in the final scene. And what a redemption it is in the end. The meaning of facial expressions and the philosophy behind it comes from a French philosopher Emmanuel Lévinas, who both of the brothers admire and from whom they get background for their philosophy of film.The Promise is thinking - philosophy of film. The brothers have stabilized film as an instrument for philosophy. I hope that the true film fanatics get to see this and appreciate it as much as I do. In addition to its themes of change, father-son relationship and trespassing, The Promise challenges the viewer to think on its own. The brothers force us to meet the moral choices out there.

But not this time. in the first shot I felt the uniqueness of this film. Attention to detail by the director and the tense scenes and a professional camera from the start, make this film an unforgettable experience for every true film fans.The main protagonist of the film is the famous Michael Douglas and very easily say that this is his best role as the same side and on the best directorial achievement Joel Schumaher. It really is hard to find some flaw in the film. By Michael Douglas is a man after a strenuous job to become very frustrated with his current relationship with the family, and from a reputable intellectual man turns into a serious threat to anyone he had disrupted the already bad day. However, Douglas in this film portrays not an evil man but a man who cares about his family, from which he was denied access to court. However, he does not hesitate, and his goal of leaving the victims in its path.This film is a critique of society, racism, nationalism, work, etc. incorrectness. The screenplay was also revised up to a maximum and intelligent rich detail. This film is a classic that deserves the status and will be remembered for his prominent role as Douglas.

This is the one with the Egyptian pyramids, the female Soviet agent, the metal-mouthed henchman Jaws, the magnificent underwater lair (complete with shark tank), the U.S. submarine crew, the amphibious sportscar, and the silly opening ski scene. The title song (a.k.a. Nobody Does It Better) is sung by Carly Simon. Roger Moore returns as 007 for the third time, with Barbara Bach as the pretty Soviet agent.What's interesting about THE SPY WHO LOVED ME is that it gives a human face to the Cold War enemies. The British Secret Service and the KGB must work together to thwart a common threat. James Bond meets his match in his female Russian counterpart. But we see that for every anonymous agent killed in the spy games, there's someone back home left heartbroken.This is one of the better Bond films, in my opinion. Probably not my absolute favorite, but one of the good ones.The villain is a fanatic who wants to create a new world of underwater cities. This movie gives us some of the over-the-top lairs that the Bond franchise is known for. There's the submersible marine observatory (a grand sci-fi structure with a classy, sophisticated interior) and the military base within an enormous ship (with war room, cylindrical corridors, and a legion of guards in orange uniforms).We also get to see the beautiful Egyptian landscape and the famous ancient Egyptian temples. The British-Russian romance is kind of cool, and Barbara Bach is certainly nice to look at. There's some nice undersea cinematography as well.The ski scene in the opening has always seemed a little silly to me. Mostly because of the god-awful rear-projection behind Roger Moore in the close-ups. Moore is clearly standing still, cool as a cucumber, while the snowy mountains fly by in the background. I also think part of my attitude has to do with Moore's yellow and red skiing outfit, which makes James Bond look a lot like Ronald McDonald to me. But there's nothing silly about the stuntwork done in that sequence. Especially the jaw-dropping free fall off the cliff. That was amazing.THE SPY WHO LOVED ME has got to be one of my favorite Roger Moore Bonds. It's such a classic James Bond adventure and Moore really seems to act the part in this one. We see Bond follow a trail of information, combat some thugs, match wits with his rival, and meet all sorts of beautiful women. (The usual James Bond stuff.) The script is full of double entendres and sexual innuendos, as well as the occasional cheesy one-liner.This tenth Bond movie is a winner. There's a lot of James Bond espionage goodness, with very little that takes away from it. Many Bond films have their good points and bad, but there isn't much that is too cringe-worthy here. Just some classic James Bond action in the signature style. Solid the whole way through.
