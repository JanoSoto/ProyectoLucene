Of course, the girl's muteness multiplies the suspense hugely, as she has no way to tell anyone that she's in trouble. The loudest screams are the ones that come out as silence. The production is fine, and Siodmak's direction is pretty much impeccable. The camera glides around effortlessly, and shadows and dark spaces cover the screen strategically. At one point, a strangling victim is completely covered with a splash of shadow, and all we can see are her outspread hands (Nicholas Musuraca is responsible for the masterful photography). The acting is also quite good. McGuire expresses her emotions perfectly through her face. Ethel Barrymore, Gordon Oliver, Elsa Lanchester, and Sara Allgood, among others, make up a great supporting cast. Kent Smith plays McGuire's love interest; he is probably best remembered for his lead role in the Val Lewton vehicle The Cat People (and his reprise of the same character in Curse of the Cat People). I always find him rather adequate, but nothing more. There a couple of things I do dislike. There are a few hackneyed elements in the production, most notably the cliche of the dark and stormy night. The film is also a whodunit, a genre which has some major drawbacks. It seems worthless to me to sit there guessing throughout the film, as some people undoubtedly will. But people should realize that, in a whodunit, it could be any character who has been introduced. The writer doesn't even have to decide until the end if he doesn't want to. There's kind of a slip here, and the killer is revealed at least ten minutes too early if you're paying attention. It would have been better if the serial killer were just some stranger. Ah, I shouldn't end my reviews on flaws, because The Spiral Staircase surpasses them by miles. 9\/10.

One of the docuchannels, perhaps Discovery, showed a two-hour special on this incident, shortly after the movie was released. The documentary is a lot easier to understand than the movie itself. I emphasize historical accuracy because the rest of the film is fairly competent and doesn't need much in the way of comment. No real acting is called for. The photography is adequate, tinted beige with flying dust during daylight sequences, almost as much as silent films might have been, and a sort of sickly green at night. I had a very hard time keeping up with the location of the various units, or remnants of units, and with just exactly who was who, except for Sam Shepherd who is easily identifiable. The special effects were up to what one would expect of an expensive modern movie. There was an abundance of realistic gore, of bullets clanking off metal, and so forth. Maybe a bit too much. It was inevitable that Saving Private Ryan would initiate a new level of graphic violence.The movie delineates four groups of people. (1) The heroic American elite units, Rangers and Delta Force. (2) The villainous, practically cannibalistic rabble of the Somali militia. (3) The resentful and reluctantly cooperative Pakistanis. And (4) the Somali civilians who are suffering the most.It's a brave film because its subject is an uninvited intervention in a remote anarchistic country done for humanitarian reasons, and it was a failure. We were supposed to relieve starvation and introduce order into a social universe of moral nihilism. I remember feeling that we were going to have trouble getting along in this place that nobody had ever heard of when clips were shown on TV news of Marines standing guard on trucks that were trundling along the unpaved streets. A handful of laughing skinny kids were running alongside the trucks and knocking cartons of food off into the dust. The angry Marines, used to more discipline, were swatting and shouting at the children. For the first few days, the militia lay low. (Militia is in quotes because they weren't militia, just warring factions led by charismatic leaders.) After they realized they weren't going to be annihilated, that the UN actually DIDN'T intend to kill everyone and take over, they emerged from hiding doing what they did best, running around with automatic weapons, often mounted on the beds of old pick-ups, and shooting at one another. Well, this was what we had come to stop, right? According to respectable reports in the New Yorker and elsewhere, it was decided on our part that the biggest nuisance of all was one particular warlord. He, out of many contenders, was identified as the enemy and it was seen as necessary to arrest him, if we could find him first. The search and the attempt at capture, which this movie depicts, seems largely to have been done out of rage and frustration. Well, we didn't get the guy we were after, since this wasn't fiction. And we lost eighteen American men (all enlisted men), and the Pakistanis lost two dozen as well, though the film doesn't mention it.I was gripped by the movie from beginning to end. What I took away from it was a feeling that there are simply some missions that are impossible. After all, our most highly trained troops took high tech weapons of all sorts and deployed them against a horde of disorganized hostiles armed with nothing more than small arms and grenades launchers.

Bond's female companion JSJ is absolutely gorgeous and seems to have aged well like good wine ( on the dvd there is an interview with her today ). So all in all I think the film will age well and gain value in time to come whereas when it came out, it was probably considered rather Obsure.

But even my stubborn attachment has not blinded me from the harsh fact that the films have been going downhill for sometime now with only a very few pleasant surprises.When I first saw trailors for this movies, I wanted to see, despite the nagging voice in my head that said it might not be that great.  When it came out, I was met with plenty of great reviews.  Unfortunately, my little college town is not known for a plethera of movie theatres, so summer passed and so did this film from theatre to video\/DVD.  When a friend purchased the DVD, only then did I get to see it.What a gem!

The story is sketchy at best, it's more of a visual assault on the senses. Tetsuo is some regular looking Japanese business man type dude who has a girlfriend. One day while shaving he notices a shard of metal protruding from his face. Metallic pieces of metal start spreading all over his face and then leave, and then return again until eventually his body becomes more metal than man. There is some kind of subplot of how he came to get this strange desease. Tetsuo and his girlfriend hit some guy (who just before cut open his leg and jammed an iron bar into the slit) with their car. They take his body out into the forest to hide it -i think- and then have sex in front of the corpse for a thrill. The guy isn't dead though and somehow he gives tetsuo the desease -i think-. He comes back to haunt tetsuo as tetsuo turns into a human scrapyard and then attacks him physically in a very strange dual of metalic body morphing near the end of the film.A lot of the movie is stop motion animation mixed with live action actors. It is comparable to Eraserhead in that way but i liked this a lot more than eraserhead. While Eraserhead is really slow and monotunus, Iron man moves at a breakneck pace to an awesome industrial music soundtrack. The industrial music is perfect for this film because the film is based on dirty grimy and rusty industrial metal garbage and even the environments are all streamlined industrial parks and monotonous suburbs.The thing i like about this movie is although it is artsy it's the kind of art that's fun to look at. You don't have to be some rich art fag pretending to like weird s*** to prove that your some kind of an intellectual to like it. I was really entertained by this movie! Unlike the other reviewer I don't think this movie is purposely all f***ed up for the sake of being artistic. I think the director wanted to make a visual statement about the relationship technology has with our physical lives. More interested in telling a cool sci fi story with fantastic visuals than with coherent dialogue that makes you ponder the universe. I also didn't get the feeling that this movie took itself too seriously. It's actually quite funny at times and that's why i had fun watching it.If you don't like movies that give you no hope in understanding every aspect of the plot don't watch this, but if you like WEIRD sci fi stuff that's unlike anything you've seen before than watch this!

Why not take it as that and rate the Moore Bonds in their own class?Ok, now that I've stated my position as a fan of both Bonds, we can proceed.LALD is a truly worthy introduction of the new Bond. It is lighter, more ironic, rather than cynical, and it gives Roger Moore the opportunity to show what he's best at Playing himself. That's far better than it may sound. Moore is taken like a duck to water. This is 'his' Bond - for better or for worse. I, for one, like him. He's got style, impeccable timing and a real presence - virtues not to be underestimated, if you please. LALD gives us a slick push into the 70's - into the Moore era.
