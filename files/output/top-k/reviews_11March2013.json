[{"date":"11 March 2013","score":"","review":" One of the best movies ever made An exercise in visual philosophy, using all technical resources to illustrate and narrate a mental- imaginary-and-machinations based plot line. Fight Club is a fable of the id, ego, and super ego interacting, to revive the main character (Jack) from his stupor. This lethargy and detachment from his bodily needs and id instincts, prevents him to sleep and mate. His sexual drive and need for love have been channeled into consumerism. He buys things he doesn't need compulsively, to escape his misery without success. The solutions he (or his psyche segments) comes up with are evolutionary, but basically of the same substance he longs and aches for to awaken him from this lethargy. He starts off visiting shockingly bleeding heart - support groups. Used to the corporate politically correct, neutral and aseptic dialogues, this candidness rattles him up towards vitality, recognizing his own humanity, enlightening the steps to come in the path. Nirvana is his desired path, the path at the very core of all human being that looks for religion, drugs or any perception of god or what is beyond words and things, and ultimately that ghost inside us. His Id\/super ego is Tyler Durden. He shows him how to escape from fear. That fear that drove him to drown himself into things, in work and vapid banality. Then there comes the Fight Club. Fight club wasn't about winning or losing... It wasn't about words, says Jack. It is not about violence in the sense of hurting someone else out of anger, I would add. Jack is detached from the animal we are, that eats, defecates, has sex and breathes. Jack is detached from the caveman we have been for thousands of years, that civilized men despise, but is rooted in our DNA. Jack is an extreme case of the dangers of excessive consumerism, individuality and materialism of our culture. Jack fears loosing (a fight, his job, anything that threatens his ego or causes him pain) and longs for human contact and intimacy. Searching for a relationship is a big stretch. Baby steps, the support group first. Then fighting furnishes him with all this. I would like to address the movie's critics like Robert Ebert, who fail to seize the zeitgeist and how fight club relates and how the violence is tangential. The story is about a very particular individual with a very common pathology who seeks a very unorthodox solution in a very dire, desperate situation. This masterpiece exercises and puts forth visual philosophy, displaying what would be a modern version of Zen enlightenment's exercises or Koans. There is no doctor that treats greed and Ikea fetishes. This dude is on his own. He needs to get in touch with his masculinity and loose the fear at the root of all fears, the fear of death, and so do the other attendees of the Fight Club. Fighting is a start; the fear of physical harm is in the same line. Guys don't go to Fight Club to win, everyone is a winner, because the target is to unload the burden of fear. If you desensitize yourself to the fear of punches and blood, abstract fear triggers, as being fired diminish by contrast. Our culture is plagued with fears of the unknown, the what ifs that blocks us from taking risks that could change or enhance our life. Tyler Durden, the superego is boundless and moves forward unfettered to things that are not realistic for the ego, the pranks and crimes against possessions of the project mayhem. But before that he confronts Jack with the fear of death using chemical burn. Crazy, unorthodox yet effective, and more important in a movie entertaining. Finally, Jack evolves towards love, the main driver from the start. The movie is a love story. His relationship with the woman is abrasive, because his sexuality is twisted, hence is expressed through unexpected outlets and forms at the start. He develops his personality and is able to express caring for a female and start a relationship and integrates his psyche, destroying his overpowering superego. Metaphorically expressed by the dissolution of Tyler. A beautifully aesthetically stunning crafted movie, fluid as our thougth processes are. From the start it displays a voyage through the brain's fear center. As a fable that it is, the use of special effects and creative, aggressive, edgy cinematography suspends your disbelief into a journey into a very human experience, a tale about our war. As Tyler Durden says when he puts the finger on our greed\/consumerism epidemic our war is a spiritual war. Interwoven masterfully are the elements of a man's struggle with this disease and fighting our war. It never stops being an action film. The rant that Tyler delivers to the fight club, encapsulates some of the concerns the movie wants to bring the audience to brood upon. It is one of the few easy lines thrown in your lap to understand the movie and the issues brought to light. Issues related to living lives without meaning, in mechanic jobs we hate, to buy stuff conditioned by the media to, but that we really don't truly need. We've become consumer droids. Space monkeys conditioned to press buttons towards oblivion. The media offers its carrot fame, fortune, and every Ego-booster conceivable. And if the entanglement is rooted on the ego logic, ego perception and egotistic behavior it only messes up the problem further. All reinforces the need to gain awareness of the influence of the ego. The movie doesn't wrap up nicely the majority of the answers to these questions, and throws them on your lap. This movie left me with the strong impression of watching one of the most aggressive criticisms towards the dangers of excessive consumerism, of my generation. It is difficult to believe it was made by the director of Seven and two of the most prominent actors of our generation,who put their necks on the line to express these concerns.Bravo!!

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"11 March 2013","score":"","review":" A year after Steven Soderbergh's The Limey was released, Stephen Kay unleashed upon us their remake of 1971 British thriller Get Carter; a film about a low level hoodlum travelling a relatively long distance to look into the death of a family member, before indeed uncovering sordid plots and such they always suspected were there. The fact The Limey is as good as it is would make it doubly unforgivable if one were to opt for the said Get Carter remake if faced between picking it and Soderbergh's film here. Principally, the man has taken a similar idea but brought a great deal of substance where in Kay's effort there was fatuity; a degree of life and ingenuity where there was formula and this sense of verve and energy where there was a just lot of bland 'muscle' going through the motions. Invoke Get Carter at your peril, remake it at your ***. But where The Limey's catalyst is the suspicious death of one of its anti-heroic lead's family on account of a driving accident, it does so well with the material anyway that it gets away with it &#x96; telling an engaging tale with a dynamic visual approach.The film is about a titular limey (American slang for an Englishman) in the sunny city of Los Angeles, a man omnipresent on account of doing some of his own investigations into a little driving incident wherein his daughter died. Where everything looks harmless and natural enough, our Limey lead Wilson (Stamp) has suspicions that he believes will lead to finding out what really happened. As a character, Wilson is almost certainly of both his era and ilk that is to say, hardened and from a time and place in 1960's Britain that is light years from where he finds himself now. Rough and often emotionless, although not without a degree of kindness revealed through the way he reminisces and speaks enthusiastically about his past and things such as the music he likes, there is something appealing about watching a tale about this carefree Londoner, who knows what it's like to kill, maim, thieve and serve time, plopped into a contemporary California dominated by the beating sun; houses up in the bluffs and punk African American hit men.Soderbergh doesn't hang around, he drops us headfirst into L.A. and Wilsons's universe. A musical track belts out over the images, a singer singing about searching low and high; the lyric they call him the seeker as our Wilson stands on screen - immediately inferring a man on a mission to find someone\/thing. We're at an airport, and Wilson has just stepped off the plane from Great Britain. Amidst all the activity out front, it is the two seemingly innocuous police officers of the L.A.P.D. that catches Wilson's eye suggesting some sort of history or link to the law. He knocks about town for a while; meets up with a man of Hispanic descent named Eduardo (Guzmán), who'll provide help and answers, then demonstrates his truly unhinged nature when he marches into a blue collar warehouse and starts pushing around those who run it. Tell him I'm coming! he shouts, and we get a feel for just how both determined and angry he really is.Cut to he who it is Wilson will eventually come to seek Peter Fonda's Terry Valentine; a record producer who lives behind his bodyguards inside of a secluded mansion. Soderbergh pulls a trick on us here, in that while Valentine is essentially the villain of the piece, he is not some snarling; foaming-at-the-mouth; evidently evil individual who slots into the role of the antagonist just as easily as Wilson does the hero. Valentine is softly spoken, even frail looking. We get the feeling should Wilson and this man come face to face; it'll be over quite quickly. He talks to a young woman named Adhara (Heinle), his girl friend, about things such as how one should name their children after star consolations because, like, y'know, it's kind of a cool thing to do. Even his name, Valentine, conjures up the sort of immediate imagery more inclined towards love and fondness and not spite or wickedness, etc. Wilson is, by comparison, much more aggressive and hard bodied; a man not afraid of violence nor probably much into talking about the esoteric qualities of naming kids after star signs.The editing in the film is of particular interest, a film unfolded using stock footage from an old Ken Loach film doubling up as flashbacks of Stamp's character's past; an array of filters and the sort of manipulation of time that sees Wilson recount the same story twice to two different people whilst only ever presenting to us one instance of him telling it. Such an approach calls to mind John Boorman's techniques that he applied to a similarly realist\/avant-garde crime picture in 1967's Point Blank; a film told as such so as to replicate its lead's damaged, perhaps even confused, outlook on the world as they recovered from a gunshot wound. Here, having got a sense our lead Wilson (not too far from Walker, Lee Marvin's Point Blank character) is as damaged (albeit in a psychological sense), the idea of splicing the film up by cutting back and forth from strand to strand; tense to tense is inspired so as to invoke a shattered mentality. In a sense, The Limey is the hard boiled revenge film for people who do not like hard boiled revenge films. It is the antidote to those people who get it into their heads that specific genres or 'types' of films are for set genders or those in a particular age bracket.

Gibson played a guy named Porter. We never learn his Christian name and the villains have a tough time remembering not only his name but also the amount of money that he demands. You see, our career criminal protagonist accompanied another hoodlum on a robbery. They steal $140 thousand from three Chinese gangsters who are on their way to launder their loot. Our heroes collide with them in a back alley. Literally, Porter crashes head-on into these guys who aren't wearing their seat belts. No sooner have Val (Gregg Henry) and Porter stolen the money from them than Val engineers a double-cross using Porter's own wife to kill him. The problem is that Lynn doesn't put nearly enough slugs into her husband to keep him down for the count. The film opens with Gibson explaining in a voice-over about his predicament. Since he is a criminal, he cannot walk or stumble into a hospital emergency room with two bullets embedded in his back and expect to leave with the doctors filling out a report about a shooting. Five months later after our protagonist has recovered from the shooting, he goes after Val to get his money back. As it turns out, Val used the loot to payback a debt that he owed to the mob. Now, he is a mob-protected man and lives in their hotel, the Oakwood, on Union and 17th where he enjoys all the comforts of home. Porter awakens him to the reality of a new day and demands that he get his $70-thousand. Naturally, Val tries to talk his way out of it, but Porter doesn't believe a word of it.

All I can say is that I've made much worse decisions in my life - much wiser ones too. Joe Somebody is a wholesome, competent exercise in family filmmaking, yet its premise is dull, its drama is lukewarm, its messages\/morals are jumbled, and we end on a hokey note with the only thing to truly think about being the asinine, cutesy little twist (employing that word loosely).Tim Allen stars as Joe Scheffer, a hard-working everyman who is recently going through divorce, suffering a distinct lack of appreciation at his cubicle-job, despite ten years of employment. One Take your daughter to work day he's anxiously going to show his little girl (Hayden Panettiere) the people there, but the problem ensues from when he tries to park in his lot. The spot is taken by a narcissistic oaf (Patrick Warburton), who shouldn't even be parking in the lot because it's reserved for those who have worked at the place for ten-plus years. When Joe tries to confront the man, he is punched twice in the face, being shamed in front of the office and his daughter. Even though it's relatively early in the film, this scene works as we truly sympathize with Joe and his predicament. Can you imagine such a disrespectful, unnecessary blow (no pun intended) to your ego, let alone one in front of someone who looks up to you? The scene, in a loose sense, is kind of heartbreaking.However, sympathy is short-lived and familiarity begins to breed contempt faster than Joe's face returns to white and not red. Desperate for respect, yet too humiliated to come to work, there Joe sits in his home, drinking heavily and bleaching items in his home like a maid with OCD. With motivation from Meg Harper (Julie Bowen), his attractive coworker, Joe decides to get back on his feet, only this time, taking a ramshackle self-defense class taught by Jim Belushi, playing a hack action movie star.What unfolds is a predictable, unmemorable state of affairs involving Joe being taught how to defend himself, conquer fears, and be a more assertive male. There's nothing wrong with this story (when put with a sly writer and a confident director, it could've been quite the time), but what makes the story airless and impotent is the abrupt identity crisis it has with itself during the final act. Joe plans to fight the same idiot that punched him in an open field, which makes sense seeing how he was humiliated and is now being taught to be defensive. But wait; Meg believes it's wrong and Joe is how he is and manipulating your natural personality is wrong.Now we've walked into not only a morality issue, but a thematic issue all together.

Well, it being one of my wife's all time favourites she insisted we watched it and now I'm convinced that it might have been the first time I've seen it all the way through. It is a fun, madcap adventure that's only problem is that with time it has become a little predictable. However, that doesn't make it any less fun and it certainly presents the best possible of baby changing bachelor(s) life and inept new father's taking care of baby. Its not a new concept, we've seen it time and time again even on Television but this is still an 80's classic thanks to chemistry of the cast, a solid story and simple fun. Only an eighties movie could mix together the new father angle with drug dealers and a thriller type ending in a construction building. A great 80's film in my opinion encompasses and shows off everything we loved about the 80's and this film does that. Success, gluttony (but in a good way), free love, spirit, bright bold and sassy with a touch of gaudiness and you will see all of that in Three Men and a Baby. It also is unique in the fact that it really isn't a family film, it really was geared to adults making it a unique comedy in that way.I could start with any of the main three guys but I will start with my favourite, the unbeatable Mr. Tom Selleck. He's handsome, he's suave, he's an incredibly versatile actor and he was at his prime in this film. His chemistry is palpable and you can see it at every turn. He is a scene stealer just by being Tom Selleck. You can't hardly make an adult 80's comedy without Steve Guttenberg. You can make fun of him, and you can point out he is always the same character but you can't deny he commands attention in 80's comedies. He has a down to earth style that you really like and he's good in this. I happen to think that he gets downplayed because of Selleck and Ted Danson but he is still a welcome member of the cast and has great comedic timing. Ted Danson basically plays Sam Malone in this film. He is absent for almost half the movie and his character has a much faster story than the other two guys but he is still a necessary part to the three men aspect. You can't deny the three of them have great chemistry and they all have at least one great scene between them that will make you laugh, smile or feel all warm and fuzzy. I can't say a lot for the supporting cast, they are all good but they do nothing more than support the three guys. Even our villains are mostly just run of the mill bad guys that don't really shine in their roles but they are completely adequate.I was nearly bowled over when I saw Leonard Nimoy directed this film.

All three of them were 80's TV and movie heavyweights so you just let them do what they do and it works. The movie is fun and light, cute and weepy at times but it just hits the right chords. No one will ever say its a brilliant feat of film making but the fun and entertainment factor is without a doubt high!

It's an unsettling story that's way too oratorical for my tastes and seems more dependent on style over substance, but for some reason I can't explain, it still lured me because it was very entertaining. I could rattle on for hours of all the flaws in this movie, and yet after all the ranting I still find something that made this movie at least worthwhile. And the main element that made this film worthy to view comes in one person and his name's Brad Pitt. Just Pitt's performance alone eradicates all the flaws that have materialized in the entire movie alone.Situated in the great state of Montana in the early 20th century, it tells the tale of the Ludlow family as Col. William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) decides to resign from military life after getting frustrated over the government's neglecting the policies over Native People. The story begins in the year 1914 when the youngest of the three Ludlow brothers Samuel (Henry Thomas) introduces his family towards his new fiancée, Susannah (Julia Ormond). But her welcoming has quite a chain reaction because the oldest Ludlow brother Alfred (Aidan Quinn) is also smitten by her presence, but she has her eyes set on the middle son, Tristan (Brad Pitt). Soon the three brothers follow their father's legacy and go off to fight in the First World War. Sadly one of the brothers gets killed and a love triangle ensues between the surviving two brothers and leaving poor Susannah in the middle.For the opening half hour I actually was glued to the seat. At first I was given the impression that this movie was going to be a good, wholesome family drama with tons of positive issues going for it. All the performances were quite brilliant and the exchange in dialogues by the Ludlow Brothers felt natural like they really were brothers and the pacing was perfect in a way that it was neither rushed or lagging, but right in the middle. But once the brothers journey off to Europe, the movie starts to fall apart and never has time to recover. One minute I'm enjoying this confidently made movie and then next thing you know it falls off the tracks and like a bumpy ride you feel yourself relived that it's finally over. What transpires in this rubble is Tristan travelling the globe with a guilty conscious while he's selling alcohol to the Irish and we're treated to three funerals. And by making the story feel like a Native American legend, we see Tristan mysteriously befriending a bear, which not only looks comical, but contrived.Though the script and the performances may have looked awkward, I would have to say that the technical features. In 1989, director Edward Zwick created a brilliant atmosphere when he made Glory and he follows this flow with him in Legends of the Fall. The war scenes look identical to Glory with only contrasting uniforms. John Toll's photography located in Alberta and British Columbia (passing off as Montana) is picturesque and that one scene where Susannah is reading a note as she walks through the coniferous trees was absolutely stunning. The musical score by James Horner is as smooth to the ears that you might hum to easily. As the story seems to progressively lack, the sights and sounds of Legends of the Fall get better through time.In spite of all that the best casting choice Zwick provides for us is the performance of Brad Pitt. From the early start, Pitt grabs our attention Sure he has to carry himself through the bloated melodramatic moments, but it's that intensity that plays a pivotal part in this role and is voided from being overdone and his tearful moments don't look superficial like crocodile tears that some of the male performers provide. The letdown here is that Pitt fades away from the narrative in substantial periods of time as the other Ludlow brothers and Susannah become the central characters.

It's an unsettling story that's way too oratorical for my tastes and seems more dependent on style over substance, but for some reason I can't explain, it still lured me because it was very entertaining. I could rattle on for hours of all the flaws in this movie, and yet after all the ranting I still find something that made this movie at least worthwhile. And the main element that made this film worthy to view comes in one person and his name's Brad Pitt. Just Pitt's performance alone eradicates all the flaws that have materialized in the entire movie alone.Situated in the great state of Montana in the early 20th century, it tells the tale of the Ludlow family as Col. William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) decides to resign from military life after getting frustrated over the government's neglecting the policies over Native People. The story begins in the year 1914 when the youngest of the three Ludlow brothers Samuel (Henry Thomas) introduces his family towards his new fiancée, Susannah (Julia Ormond). But her welcoming has quite a chain reaction because the oldest Ludlow brother Alfred (Aidan Quinn) is also smitten by her presence, but she has her eyes set on the middle son, Tristan (Brad Pitt). Soon the three brothers follow their father's legacy and go off to fight in the First World War. Sadly one of the brothers gets killed and a love triangle ensues between the surviving two brothers and leaving poor Susannah in the middle.For the opening half hour I actually was glued to the seat. At first I was given the impression that this movie was going to be a good, wholesome family drama with tons of positive issues going for it. All the performances were quite brilliant and the exchange in dialogues by the Ludlow Brothers felt natural like they really were brothers and the pacing was perfect in a way that it was neither rushed or lagging, but right in the middle. But once the brothers journey off to Europe, the movie starts to fall apart and never has time to recover. One minute I'm enjoying this confidently made movie and then next thing you know it falls off the tracks and like a bumpy ride you feel yourself relived that it's finally over. What transpires in this rubble is Tristan travelling the globe with a guilty conscious while he's selling alcohol to the Irish and we're treated to three funerals. And by making the story feel like a Native American legend, we see Tristan mysteriously befriending a bear, which not only looks comical, but contrived.Though the script and the performances may have looked awkward, I would have to say that the technical features. In 1989, director Edward Zwick created a brilliant atmosphere when he made Glory and he follows this flow with him in Legends of the Fall. The war scenes look identical to Glory with only contrasting uniforms. John Toll's photography located in Alberta and British Columbia (passing off as Montana) is picturesque and that one scene where Susannah is reading a note as she walks through the coniferous trees was absolutely stunning. The musical score by James Horner is as smooth to the ears that you might hum to easily. As the story seems to progressively lack, the sights and sounds of Legends of the Fall get better through time.In spite of all that the best casting choice Zwick provides for us is the performance of Brad Pitt. From the early start, Pitt grabs our attention Sure he has to carry himself through the bloated melodramatic moments, but it's that intensity that plays a pivotal part in this role and is voided from being overdone and his tearful moments don't look superficial like crocodile tears that some of the male performers provide. The letdown here is that Pitt fades away from the narrative in substantial periods of time as the other Ludlow brothers and Susannah become the central characters. Which is too bad because the characters lack the panache to keep the audience from drifting off.

Lethal Weapon 3 may have had the best intro scene but it too was just lazy in the aspect of its script, as it was more like let's get a girl for Riggs than it was let's make a buddy cop movie.Here the duo are up against the Kung Fu fighting Jet Li, his introduction added the Kung Fu genre in to this action comedy and Richard Donner the director just didn't have what it took to make this Lethal Weapon a master piece, but if this movie is to stand on its own it is a nice action comedy.Again the score is done by the trio of Michael Kamen, Eric Clapton & David Sanborn, although here the whole hip addition didn't make me enjoy the score as I did in the previous movies.In this flick our buddy cop duo is up against the Chinese Triads.

I don't know and that is up to your opinion, but all I can say is that I try not to watch films with those impressions influencing my expectations. Although what I can say is that I greatly appreciate this film and I can accept the praise and I feel it is one of the best films I have ever watched.Despite being from the 40's, this movie somehow feels fresh to me, even today in this day and age! The way that this story is told feels so intrinsic. The movie begins with an introduction of the whole story that really took me off guard at first, but then I realized it didn't tell the human aspects of the story that was to follow and this is one of the most unique introductions in a movie I have ever seen. You think you know the whole story from this mini-documentary styled intro, but this is still a jigsaw puzzle that still needs to be solved by the people who know Kane personally to fill in most of the blanks, especially the mystery of 'Rosebud.' Kane was a powerful figure, but a character who also had a sense of humanity and through this, it's easy to feel a connection to Kane. As we delve into the human aspect of the film, we become more and more immersed with the story and it is a very human story, in my opinion. This to me is what makes the movie effective.And what also astounds about the story is that it feels complete and it did not need to have anything else added to enhance or add further drama to the story. You would think a movie that tries to tell a story of a man's life young to old would feel rushed, but at this running time, it feels like you know the guy! Never have I seen such character development this good and fleshed out on film. And to top it all off, the makeup looks very realistic, along with Orson Welle's acting, which perfectly pulls it off for his different ages throughout the movie.And that is only a few of the great aspects of this film. The great cinematography techniques in the movie have definitely made me more analytical and aware of these intricacies in film. Not only is the story filled with ambition, but you can see it in the beautiful visuals. From Kane's huge, but sparse mansion to scenes utilizing chiaroscuro, you can see the influence it had on films today. From starring and also directing this film, you can see from watching the film the amount of ambition that Orson Welles poured out into this epic.After watching Citizen Kane, I cannot help but feel like there has been a transition from me being a casual movie watcher to a serious film buff. With its simple, but grandiose story, its breathtaking visuals and even the music that perfectly compliments every scene, this movie has become a timeless beauty that ages like fine wine.

The movie begins with an introduction of the whole story that really took me off guard at first, but then I realized it didn't tell the human aspects of the story that was to follow and this is one of the most unique introductions in a movie I have ever seen. You think you know the whole story from this mini-documentary styled intro, but this is still a jigsaw puzzle that still needs to be solved by the people who know Kane personally to fill in most of the blanks, especially the mystery of 'Rosebud.' Kane was a powerful figure, but a character who also had a sense of humanity and through this, it's easy to feel a connection to Kane. As we delve into the human aspect of the film, we become more and more immersed with the story and it is a very human story, in my opinion. This to me is what makes the movie effective.And what also astounds about the story is that it feels complete and it did not need to have anything else added to enhance or add further drama to the story. You would think a movie that tries to tell a story of a man's life young to old would feel rushed, but at this running time, it feels like you know the guy! Never have I seen such character development this good and fleshed out on film. And to top it all off, the makeup looks very realistic, along with Orson Welle's acting, which perfectly pulls it off for his different ages throughout the movie.And that is only a few of the great aspects of this film. The great cinematography techniques in the movie have definitely made me more analytical and aware of these intricacies in film. Not only is the story filled with ambition, but you can see it in the beautiful visuals. From Kane's huge, but sparse mansion to scenes utilizing chiaroscuro, you can see the influence it had on films today. From starring and also directing this film, you can see from watching the film the amount of ambition that Orson Welles poured out into this epic.After watching Citizen Kane, I cannot help but feel like there has been a transition from me being a casual movie watcher to a serious film buff. With its simple, but grandiose story, its breathtaking visuals and even the music that perfectly compliments every scene, this movie has become a timeless beauty that ages like fine wine.

We see less and less of them now, and back when it came out in 2001, in the chronological footsteps of Hannibal, it was an open relief, there was another serial killer pic on standby. The Watcher is fun and totally entertaining, despite a terrible performance from Reeves, as a demented twisted nut who strangles young innocent women, loners, strays runaways, with piano wire, his motives kept under lock and key here. Enter retired and haunted Detective Spader, who was working the case, now reduced to what little life he has, in his new city, seeing a shrink (Marissa Tomei-the best out of the three leads) and dining at the same lousy Vietnamese restaurant. But guess who's back in town on the taunt. Pulled back into action, Spader now works with the cops in tracking down Reeves, who's sending him photographs by envelope of intended murder victims, and so begins a race against time, where Spader's given so many days to find them. Spader's off to a good start as he's not a daily mail checker. By photo, he has to make out the location, then doorknock, etc. There's moments of great intensity, amidst some lashings of heavy gore at times (remember piano wire can really cut deep) and we see Keanu waltz with one of the chosen, before the young stray senses this guys odd, and makes an exit. There's something definitely odd about Keanu's performance. He doesn't even come across as a serial killer, his straight hair that gives him more of an ordinary look. It's probably one of the worst casting decisions I've ever seen in my life. The Watcher does have bits of great suspense, plus an explosive, you would say and cool car chase, that really proves what this nuts capable of. Spader later is summoned by Keanu to a cemetery that provides some funny moments. When Tomei becomes in danger, Spader must save her and kill Keanu and finally puts his demons to rest. A highly entertaining serial killer flick, of course not in the same vein as Hannibal, and with such helpless victims here, who've never done any harm to anybody, it makes you wanna get up and shout at Reeves, and tell him to actually get a life instead of taking one.

She is the French lieutenant's woman and is shunned by the village for having had an affair with the married man. She now moons over her absent lover and waits for the return that will never be realized.Irons is an independently wealthy naturalist who visits the village in search of fossils and finds love for the darkly mysterious Streep, although Irons himself has just married into a family of some repute. He divorces his wife -- shocking! -- and gives up his status as an honorable gentleman. He gives Streep money, and later follows her to London, loses her, finds her three years later, and she rejects him because she has now become a liberated woman.There is a parallel story that doesn't get much time. It takes place today. Irons and Streep, both married, are having a fling during the shooting of a film. Again, Irons falls in love, but for Streep the encounter was far more casual and despite his efforts, she takes off happily with her French husband.The only Fowles novel I've read is The Magus, which follows a similar trajectory -- man is coerced into a woman's thrall and is then deliberately and openly betrayed by her. The traditional Madia Gond, a tribe in India, had a custom called the ghotul in which adolescent boys and girls lived in the same house and played musical beds each night, whether they wanted to or not. The elders of the tribe claimed that this practice was intended to cure them of love. I begin to wonder if Fowles isn't on the same trip. You know, Most friendship is feigning; most loving mere folly? Jeremy Irons as the uptight Victorian naturalist manqué never steps wrong. He ALWAYS never steps wrong. Meryl Streep. If you've seen her in later character roles like The Iron Lady, you may not remember how lovely, pale, and fragile she could be in her earlier films. She's a splendid actress, even though make up has given her a mop of dark reddish hair so massive that it may have its own time zones.

A prisoner smoking with a cigarette holder, a masterful touch!

Let's brake it in pieces The story. It was made to shock and sadden, and let's just say it does it very well.

The Acting. Bjork is the second worst Oscar mistake in the leading ladies category of modern times (In a close second after Fernanda Montenegro for City of God). It was a truly difficult path the one she walked to build the character (one that led to big fights with the director, Lars Von Trier, to the point when they no longer spoke with each other on the filming set), and it wasn't in vain. The naiveté of her Selma and her determination and her desperation and fall are the most raw and truthful piece of soul I ever saw exposed on a fictional story. It is truly disturbing, but in a wonderful way. The worst it gets the more vivid, the more beautiful. It is acting at its best. The music.

Seven years later it reemerges so a rescue crew goes after it trying to figure out where it's been the entire time. I saw EVENT HORIZON when it was first released and really couldn't understand why it gained so many negative reviews. There's no question that the film contains some flaws but it's also a rather ambitious film that relies just as much on its story than just the special effects. I thought director Paul Anderson did a fantastic job early on really making the viewer feel uneasy. There's a brief line where a crew member talks about how far they are from safety and this scene perfectly builds up a rather dark tension because you realize that these people really are on their own with no one to help them. The entire atmosphere of the film is incredibly dark and while I'm not going to give anything away, what the story attempts to do with where the ship has gone was rather unique and I think that for the most part it works. Now, if you've ever heard of this film then you know about the various issues it ran into during the test screenings. There's been talk of a director's cut, which I think might help out many of the flaws. The story takes us to a rather dark direction but it just seems as if something is missing. There are a few questions that need to be answered and there are a few things that don't make much sense but perhaps these were forced to be left on the cutting room floor.

The special effects are also another major plus including an incredibly beautiful opening sequence as well as the effects really making you feel as if you're in space the entire time. Some have been critical of some of the graphic and bloody violence but I thought it actually played well into the story and didn't take away from anything.

Seven years later it reemerges so a rescue crew goes after it trying to figure out where it's been the entire time. I saw EVENT HORIZON when it was first released and really couldn't understand why it gained so many negative reviews. There's no question that the film contains some flaws but it's also a rather ambitious film that relies just as much on its story than just the special effects. I thought director Paul Anderson did a fantastic job early on really making the viewer feel uneasy. There's a brief line where a crew member talks about how far they are from safety and this scene perfectly builds up a rather dark tension because you realize that these people really are on their own with no one to help them. The entire atmosphere of the film is incredibly dark and while I'm not going to give anything away, what the story attempts to do with where the ship has gone was rather unique and I think that for the most part it works.

If the men of Company C aren't eating dirt, they're getting soaked by God's own rain, or shelled from the heights of Monte Casino. I guess that's why they call combat infantry men 'grunts'. It's one heck of a dirty business as the men crawl up the Italian boot after the grudging Nazi's. I can see why they call it 'the fog of war'. No one seems to know what's going on beyond shooting at the enemy. No doubt about it, director Wellman did all he could to deglamorize anything smacking of Hollywood cosmetics. I can't help thinking GI mail got clogged with bars of soap after this movie.The treatment's one of the best from the war years. Everybody pretty much low-keys it in the emotions department, Mitchum especially. There's no theatrics, just guys trying to stay together and keep breathing. The scratchy record from home just about sums up the unspoken emotions. As good as the movie is, it's still within the limits of what could be shown during this Production Code period. In short, realism gets cut short in the blood and guts department, unlike, say, Saving Private Ryan (1998), where the gore flows freely. None of that here. Men die cleanly, but no less tragically. I'm guessing the captain's (Mitchum) death is not shown so that we're forced to hold our breath, while that long, long cadaver caravan passes by. It's a poignant end to the film, but not for the men who continue the slog up the Italian boot. Fine movie.(In passing&#x97;I guess the project was made before Ernie Pyle was killed by a Japanese sniper on Ie Shima. Here, actor Meredyth certainly appears to do him justice.)

Along with being one of Brad Pitt and Jason Patric's first major roles, it also launched the film careers of Jonathan Tucker and Geoff Wigdor. Along with a terrific cast of legends and newcomers, Sleepers brought with it an intense story, the likes of which we hadn't really seen before. The film starts out by introducing us to four boys in Hell's Kitchen during the 1960's. These boys are your typical young teens, having fun, and horsing around, when a horrible accident leads them to jail. This is where they're troubles really begin. The second part of the film jumps twenty years into the future, where we see firsthand how this abuse had a profound effect on all the boys, and the results that come from their behavior. The only major actor in both time periods is Kevin Bacon who just keeps getting better. By that point in his career, I'm sure Bacon could have play just about anyone and made it believable. Other people like Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, give strong performance in what amounts to bit parts in support of the newcomers. Their influence can be seen throughout the film, especially in support of the child actors who I'm sure benefited from being around such legends of the screen. Sleepers is an unbelievable true story that was so well written and supported by some fantastic performances. It's not the perfect movie, but I think it's pretty close.

The film's standout performance comes from one of these soldiers, and that belongs to Tom Berenger as Sgt. Barnes. He's a ruthless and brutal man, and plays well opposite Willem Dafoe,mwho is also quite good.On the other hand, Charlie Sheen's performance was one of the film's faults.
