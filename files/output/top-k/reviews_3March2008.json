On the one hand, it cannot be said that the film is bad. It started out as a clever comedy; it made its point about corrupt governments and general public believing anything they see on television; all hints were clear, all actors seemed okay; dialogs were smart; everything was fine. Closer to the end it felt like the writers got carried away and lost control to a certain extent, becoming more illogical and absurd with each scene; but considering that the film was a comedy, it could be forgiven.But the ending just completely puzzled me. I sat bewildered for five more minutes staring at the titles. I did not understand what they wanted to say by this.The first part of the film was a satire, but it was funny. All the inconsistencies, exaggerations, lack of logics, and broad generalizations seen in the first part of the movie could be accepted only if the film posed as a satirical comedy. I hate talking about happy endings, but a (more or less) happy ending could help this movie stay a satirical comedy. But the abrupt and cruel ending suddenly claimed that the film was politically realistic. If so, it rendered the rest of the movie almost totally ridiculous. I do not want to say that a movie cannot or must not be funny AND serious at the same time, but in Wag the Dog there is an abyss with a very thin bridge between the two aspects, and it is not very good for style.I am not going to argue whether Americans or other nations are actually so stupid en masse as to be so ignorant of the outside world and to believe everything their politicians say on TV; maybe, they are, after all (though I personally would like to hope they aren't). Distract attention scenarios are quite popular nowadays even on the family scale, to say nothing about politicians and governments manipulating the public opinion. Maybe it IS actually possible to fake a war (only the process would not be as simple as in the movie and would not involve so many people, hundreds of potential leaks). So basically, from the viewpoint of credibility, the scheme outlined in the film maybe holds water. But the filmmakers should have been more careful about what they actually wanted. If they wanted a cynical satire, it should not have an ending like this. And vice versa, if they wanted a serious political warning of sorts, all absurdities and inconsistencies in the first part should not stick out that much. The movie and the ending just don't fit with each other, and it leaves the impression of something not very carefully thought out and produced hurriedly with a mere aim of shocking the audience and making money.But, striking out the ending, the film does give food for thought, even though every idea in it is exaggerated to the point of absurd.

As a result, this is a mature film about mature characters, shot in a low-key style that is beautiful, though unobtrusive; with Ozon's camera finding a sense of poetry and evocation in even the most mundane of objects to help further express the sense of grief and remembrance so central to the spirit of our main protagonist. To help convey this, the filmmaker instills his work with a lethargic mood, drawing on the silences of scenes and the physical and emotional distances between his characters to create something that is much more internal and subjective than the ensemble films that he is best known for (Sitcom, Water Drops On Burning Rocks, 8 Women, etc).It's almost a cliché to reference Bergman when talking of films that focus almost solely on the existential matters at the heart of their characters, but I suppose it could be relevant here; the film also reminded me, in tone, of Woody Allen's Bergman-esquire drama Interiors, or perhaps even Another Woman, with the film often confining itself to cramped and quiet locations in which characters meet for sex and lengthy semi-philosophical discussion. It's certainly not a film for the Friday night matinée crowd, but I'd imagine that goes without saying; with the story focusing on middle-aged characters and themes like grief, regret, loss and mental illness. However, the film manages to transcend the chamber-piece trappings of the Bergman style of drama by also giving us an element of mystery. It would be wrong to reveal too much about this central concept in something as ultimately superficial as a product review, although it's safe to say that the film hinges around a question of bereavement and the way in which this bereavement, or loss, is viewed by our central character in relation to those around her.In this respect the film is similar to George Sluizer's original version of The Vanishing, in the respect that both of these films pivot around a mysterious disappearance, which leaves the absentee's lover desperately searching for some kind of closure. Unlike The Vanishing however, Under the Sand relegates the more obvious thriller elements to the background in order to more closely analyse the effect of the disappearance and possible death on his lover and her different methods of coming to terms with it. Ozon, as evident from films like Water Drops On Burning Rocks and Swimming Pool, has a strong grasp on his actors, and here draws some beautifully rendered performances from his highly esteemed cast. As some of the other comments have already noted, the central performance from Charlotte Rampling is an absolute revelation, as she creates a character that remains elusive throughout, but at the same time, is completely sympathetic.

It's colorful, well-paced, gorgeously costumed and designed, and (assuming that you're not too cynical to enjoy a sentimental story for what it is) it's a totally absorbing and compelling two hours.Most of the characters of the drama are complicated enough to keep the film from getting too predictable, and certainly, in the hands of the great Geraldine Page, it would be hard for character NOT to be deeply interesting. Mrs. Watts is somewhat similar to Cousin Sook in the beautiful Truman Capote memoirs Miss Page performed in the late 1960's, but she has far richer monologues throughout the film that could not better underline her extraordinary skills.However, in spite of all this, I think the film is rather lacking in substance. It's QUITE sentimental, and while it never degenerates into a lament for the snows of yesteryear, it comes pretty close to it. Although there is some resolution of family tensions toward the end of the story, we never really get a terribly convincing demonstration of HOW the title's trip to Bountiful managed to bring this resolution about.For that, I tend to fault the screenplay--and perhaps I'll feel differently about it after another viewing.But that alone is characteristic my wish to see it again at some point is PURELY because I want to admire Geraldine Page--and NOT because I found the story and film so moving.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"3 March 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This is one of the most powerful movies I have seen depicting the moral dilemmas man struggles with during wartime. I have seen this film about 10 times and it still impacts me in the same way. The bonds of brotherhood run deep, but seems to be squad deep. The squad led by Captain John H. Miller, played by Tom Hanks, struggles with the question of Why do they have to risk their lives to save the life of one man. This struggle continues to become more painful with the loss of each man killed in the line of duty. Miller's statement, I just know that every man I kill, the farther away from home I feel. Give a glimpse into the emotional toll war has on the human mind and soul. This struggle seems to overshadow the deeper struggle Cpl. Timothy P. Upham has with the right the rest of the squad has with being judge, jury and executioner when dealing with a lone German soldier after being taken prisoner. After befriending Upham he wins freedom from execution, but this in turn comes back as a haunting reminder of the possible consequences of mercy in wartime. I found the scenes revolving around the return of the German soldier and his disregard for the men who offered freedom instead of execution to cause me to think about how I would have reacted. Upham's struggle with fear was painful to watch, but more painful was the realization of what his inaction had caused. The transformation of the man, from compassionate, concerned human being to judge, jury, and executioner. As the German soldier reminds him that they are friends and again pleads for his life, Upham asks him What is my name? After he answers Upham kills him. What went through Upham's mind?

I found the scenes revolving around the return of the German soldier and his disregard for the men who offered freedom instead of execution to cause me to think about how I would have reacted.

It set up a framework for which other action films could be successful, adding new equations to the action blockbuster formula.The plot is the first demonstration of a scenario thriller, or a plot that revolves around one single event and\/or place. It's' simple terrorists are attempting to steal from a wealthy businessman so they hold up and rig the building. One 90s film that for sure got its legs from Die Hard was Air Force One. Part of what makes Die Hard so good is that it sets up a premise that is easy to follow but also suspenseful. It creates its twists and turns within the main line of the plot, so you can see it all coming if you think about it, but it keeps the intensity up.Next step toward success is John McClane. You have an off-duty cop thrust into the vortex of something that he had no intention of getting involved in. It is the birth of the unsung action hero in a sense, the rebel who has what it takes, but never really knew it until he is forced into a situation. Part of what makes McClane such a good character is that while he is bad ass, he shows signs of humanity, praying that the cops will show up to help him and talking to himself.While not the film's strong suit, the subplot between McClane and his wife makes the plot work better and provides some more footing for the plot itself. Even the relationship formed between McClane and Sgt. Powell as they struggle to get the higher ups to believe them is an important part of the film. It's not exactly well put together, but it helps with the film's main goal of being a great action film, giving it just the extra amount of suspense.Lastly, the action is just good and the relationships between McClane and the terrorists is great and sometimes amusing. When McClane comes face to face with Hans Gruber, the head terrorist, and doesn't know it's him, you have a dynamic unique to action films. There's a lot of great clever action moments and stuff blows up, which is always a plus when it's not the center of what goes on.

He has a knack for playing a realistic person, with extraordinary fighting skills. There is a certain down to earth attribute he has, yet he is still larger than life. Not many action stars can manage to be that way. He is very believable as the main character. Not sure if you can count what I say about the movie as a spoiler or not, but it's there just in case.The plot is pretty good, and has two sides of it. In the future, after a plague sweeps the land, the strong survive and often prey upon the weak. On one hand, Gibson (JCVD's character) wants nothing but revenge on Fender for what he did to his love, and her children. He is a man who had a rough life, settled down with someone he fell in love with (along with her children), and started living the good life. His dream was shattered by a gang member and his crew. He is now but a shadow of his former self, living and breathing only to track down and take revenge on Fender and his gang, referred to as Pirates. He saves the life of a woman, and discovers she is a Cyborg. She claims to have the cure for the plague, and needs to be escorted to a place where doctors reside. Gibson is not interested, he only wants revenge. He happens to run into a young woman who also wants to help with the cure, and becomes his companion. Without giving anything else away, here is the good, the bad, and the ugly about this movie. The Good *Fight scenes *Scenery (looks real in every scene.) *Story *Action *Plot *Hero, villain, and support. *Believable characters, motives, and the message the movie delivers *One of the best foot chase scenes ever seen in a movieThe Bad *The Dialog is VERY bad at times. *Special Effects were pretty primitive, like the cyborg scene was pretty bad *Though Fender (Played by Vincent Klyn) is a very well done bad guy for the most part, his dialog is pretty bad at times, probably the worst in the whole movie.

You can relate to the main character, and his struggles to become human again after loosing everything he held dear. Also, I really like the sound track, and the end credit song is really awesome sounding. When it plays during the fight scenes it's really good. Definitely worth seeing, especially if you are a fan of post apocalyptic, Van Damm, or Sci-Fi movies, or just want a night with a great action film.

I do not think there was the need to stress on the time period as it was obvious that the film is way in the future and the time-gap mentioned did not sound convincing enough to begin with. The appearance of the aliens is a little awkward and looks out of place This is further followed by the cloning of the mother (perhaps Spielberg wanted to give it a happy ending) who is only able to live for 17 hours. Perhaps, this whole segment of the last 15 or so minutes could have been re-written to make it less explanatory and more suggestive.'A.I.' tells the story of a modern, well, post-post modern Pinocchio.

","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"3 March 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I can see why this particular film (and many of the director's other works) had such a hard time finding an audience when first released in 2000 - what with the endlessly roaming camera and those flashbacks that seem to come out of nowhere - but for me personally, the problems have less to do with Winterbottom's aesthetic choices as a filmmaker and more to do with audiences pre-conceived opinions about the film due to poor promotion and marketing. In my opinion, the film was woefully misrepresented by the people at Fox Pathè (the distributors) and even by the producers themselves, who seemed to announce The Claim as something of a traditional western along the lines of Unforgiven, or even as a precursor to the glossy, chocolate-box picture Cold Mountain (a film greatly inferior to this). Both of these examples are, however, worlds away from the style and atmosphere of The Claim, with Winterbottom and his screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce here providing an almost biblical downward spiral for their central characters that is as far removed from Hollywood as you can possibly get.As you can probably deduce from the title of this review, The Claim is a bleak film, dealing with characters pushed to the edge and pent up with all manner of secret shame, guilt and fury. The story takes its inspiration from Thomas Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge, but it is in no way a straight interpretation, but more of a re-investigation and analysis into that central predicament. The story therefore becomes a simple morality tale, though made all the more austere through the director's unwillingness to complicate the proceedings with bouts of melodrama or sentimentality. However, Winterbottom's films are merely simplistic on a superficial level. Like his cinematic countryman Mike Leigh, he creates work from a rough sketch that is elaborated on by his actors as the whole process goes along. Thus, in a way, the act of making a film is a lot like the building of the railroad here, and the stark changes that fall into place within the mood of the dwellers of the central town, Kingdom Come, are therefore representative of the always-shifting viewpoints and overlapping narrative time-lines that emerge as the picture unfolds.The railroad that is so central to the proceedings here has a number of meanings subtextually linked to its involvement in the plot. It is a representation of an uncertain future; about change and progress - the complete antithesis of everything that the character of Dillon represents. It is also the device that brings the pivotal outsiders into town (Dalglish, the charismatic railroad surveyor replete with a posse of men, the dying immigrant Elena, stricken with T.B. and finally - and most importantly - the aptly-named Hope; Elena's daughter here in town to search out her long-lost father). Added to this troika of outsiders, we also have the headstrong and exotic Lucile, Dillon's mistress and owner of the local whorehouse where Dalglish's wayward men spend most of their spare time. Here, the remarkable thing is how Boyce manages to bring the characters together, establishing relationships slowly, like an extended chamber piece. As the story progresses, the emphasis on Lucile, Elena and Dalglish become less apparent, as they begin to merge into the not-too-distant background as Dillon and Hope take precedence over the narrative at hand.Despite the numerous allusions and comparisons to Robert Altman's classic anti-western McCabe & Mrs. Miller, Winterbottom's directorial style is more indebted to European filmmakers, like Fassbinder, Kieslowski and Herzog; as he composes his images in a pallet of stark monochrome, with black-clad figures frost-bitten by snow juxtaposing with the void-like whiteness of the locale; all the while using the editing to break or undermine the rhythm (unlike other films of this genre, that are all about 'establishing' rhythm). The Altman references are merely superficial ciphers, with the exterior of snowbound locations, crumbling bordellos and ever-winding railroads giving way to a depiction of obsession and redemption that has more in common with a film like Fitzcaralldo. It is the character of Dillon that really carries the film, as the director singles him out as a lost soul whilst the town he once loved becomes a metaphor for his prevailing greed and anguish; an idea that goes alongside that other figurative interpretation as the town as a literal whorehouse (with Lucile its newly appointed mayor\/Madame); all allowing Winterbottom to draw parallels with a film like Quarelle or Lola by Fassbinder or the latter's inspiration, The Blue Angel.That final scene offers us a haunting evocation of pride in the face of defeat and has the ability to work its way into your subconscious via Winterbottom's use of almost universal iconography.

In my opinion, the film was woefully misrepresented by the people at Fox Pathè (the distributors) and even by the producers themselves, who seemed to announce The Claim as something of a traditional western along the lines of Unforgiven, or even as a precursor to the glossy, chocolate-box picture Cold Mountain (a film greatly inferior to this). Both of these examples are, however, worlds away from the style and atmosphere of The Claim, with Winterbottom and his screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce here providing an almost biblical downward spiral for their central characters that is as far removed from Hollywood as you can possibly get.As you can probably deduce from the title of this review, The Claim is a bleak film, dealing with characters pushed to the edge and pent up with all manner of secret shame, guilt and fury. The story takes its inspiration from Thomas Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge, but it is in no way a straight interpretation, but more of a re-investigation and analysis into that central predicament. The story therefore becomes a simple morality tale, though made all the more austere through the director's unwillingness to complicate the proceedings with bouts of melodrama or sentimentality. However, Winterbottom's films are merely simplistic on a superficial level. Like his cinematic countryman Mike Leigh, he creates work from a rough sketch that is elaborated on by his actors as the whole process goes along. Thus, in a way, the act of making a film is a lot like the building of the railroad here, and the stark changes that fall into place within the mood of the dwellers of the central town, Kingdom Come, are therefore representative of the always-shifting viewpoints and overlapping narrative time-lines that emerge as the picture unfolds.The railroad that is so central to the proceedings here has a number of meanings subtextually linked to its involvement in the plot. It is a representation of an uncertain future; about change and progress - the complete antithesis of everything that the character of Dillon represents. It is also the device that brings the pivotal outsiders into town (Dalglish, the charismatic railroad surveyor replete with a posse of men, the dying immigrant Elena, stricken with T.B. and finally - and most importantly - the aptly-named Hope; Elena's daughter here in town to search out her long-lost father).

When I do get past that, however, I find that Interview with the Vampire is a very beautifully told tale that looks deep into the heart of what evil truly is.Based on Anne Rice's novel (and also her screenplay) Interview is the retelling of Louis's (a vampire) story of how he became a vampire. The story starts in 18th century Louisiana where Louis (Brad Pitt) encounters an opportunity for eternal life when he is seeking death. A vampire named Lestat (Tom Cruise) gives him this opportunity with the expectation of companionship. When Louis has trouble disconnecting his human moral compass from his blood-lusting monster of a self, Lestat tries to test him and eventually brings him another companion when he makes Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) a vampire as well. The story is Louis's search for an understanding of this immortal life that he can come to terms with, which results in a film that explores deep into the notion of immortality with a price.The film's beauty comes from the very lavish sets and the strong mystical element that is worked into every set. Though the setting is all real world, because the film explores the fantastical world of vampires, everything seems surreal and magical. Dante Ferretti has created another beautiful movie world and Neil Jordan makes it shine through his camera-work. Jordan really brings Rice's screenplay to life, or else you'd be looking at a particularly boring film.Cruise as Lestat was a good choice. He is downright creepy and conveys the sense of moral ambiguity that Lestat represents. Pitt also shows both the strong and the weak sides of Louis, though he is not as skilled with handling some of the film's melodrama. Dunst is probably the most praiseworthy. Having to portray a child who technically has wisdom beyond her appearance is a challenge and Dunst is behind some of the film's best scenes and most suspenseful moments. Her fits of rage are probably the most interesting as is her character's predicament with never growing up, which really starts the conversation about mortality and the film's themes.Though some plot clarity would have been nice and a little less melodrama would have helped make the themes really significant to the rest of the film, Interview is a successful film from a visual standpoint. The craftsmen of this film, everyone from production design to costumes and make-up, truly made this film take off from okay to good and very interesting. There is no doubt that you are deeply interested in what happens to these characters and that is thanks to the actors and the incredible world that was envisioned for them to act in. ~Steven CVisit my site at http\/\/moviemusereviews.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"3 March 2008","score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" I'm trying to get over the fact that the ending of the film makes absolutely no sense to me (unless i'm looking hard for something that's not there).

This is Wall Street, Joe tells us at the start of Force of Evil, and today was important because tomorrow, July Fourth, I intended to make my first million dollars. An exciting day in any man's life. Temporarily, the enterprise was slightly illegal. You see, I was the lawyer for the numbers racket. Joe has a problem. His older brother, Leo (Thomas Gomez), runs a neighborhood numbers operation. Leo is a decent small-timer with a bad heart who worked his tail off so that Joe could go to law school. He knows his brother for what Joe is, a slick legal crook. Joe is in partnership with a tough gangster, Ben Tucker. They plan to break the banks of the small numbers operations, then move in and consolidate them under their own hand. They'll make millions. Joe realizes his brother will be ruined and tries to save him. Events begin to spin out of Joe's ability to control them. Joe finally finds a conscience, but only after people die. There are a lot of elements that work in this movie. The screenplay by Abraham Polonsky and Ira Wolfert centers squarely on Joe's character and his dilemma. There's no let-up for Joe as his life of legal crime slides into real crime and tightens around him. The script is not exactly poetic, that would make it self-conscious, but it is tough, thoughtful and vivid. Polonsky's direction packs a lot of action into only 82 minutes. You need to pay attention, but it all makes sense. The movie looks gritty and bleak, from the crummy apartment where Leo runs his numbers operation to the empty New York streets at dawn to the sad but redemptive scene on the banks of the East River under the bridge. There are lots of low-angle shots that emphasize the essential emptiness of Joe's character. The movie also is well cast. Some of the actors I particularly enjoyed are Howland Chamberlain as a frightened, weak numbers accountant; Paul McVey as Joe's experienced law partner; Roy Roberts as Joe's business associate, Ben Tucker, a gangster who is more ruthless than Joe thought; and Marie Windsor in a small but memorable performance as Tucker's slow-talking, smoldering wife. More than anything, the movie depends on the excellent performances of John Garfield and Thomas Gomez. Gomez has to play a sick, excitable, overweight small-time crook who has a bedrock decency. The money I made in this rotten business is no good for me, Joe. he says. I don't want it back. And Tucker's money is no good either. Joe just looks at him. The money has no moral opinions, he tells Leo. Leo stares at his brother. I find I have, Joe. I find I have. Gomez has to show his complete disdain for what his brother has become but still show us there's some strength left in the relationship. Garfield is the center of the movie. He was an actor who looked tough and sounded tough, yet he was able in his movies to show enough vulnerability not to alienate the audience. He not only had a lot of charm when he wanted to show it, he knew his craft and was good at it. The movie also is resonant because we know what happened to Polonsky and Garfield as a result of the Communist witch hunts that overtook Hollywood during the late Forties and Fifties. Polonsky was an outspoken and enthusiastic Marxist. It's no accident that Force of Evil can be seen as a parable for Big Business squeezing out the hard-working little guys. When Polonsky refused to testify before the House un-American Activities Committee, his career vanished. He continued to write screenplays but only under assumed names. It took 21 years before he was permitted to direct another film. Garfield suffered perhaps a sadder fate. He came from a poor, working class background and had always been a strong supporter of the working man. He'd never been a Communist but he had supported liberal causes. Garfield was as politically naive as a deer who has a target tattooed on his side. He agreed to testify before HUAC but refused to offer any names of people the committee wanted to know were Communist sympathizers. He was unofficially blacklisted. He had become a major star in the Forties, but the job offers suddenly dried up. He made a couple of so-so movies, then tried to re-establish himself on Broadway. He was mystified and depressed at what was happening to him. He died of a heart attack in 1952 at 39.

Gomez has to show his complete disdain for what his brother has become but still show us there's some strength left in the relationship. Garfield is the center of the movie.

He not only had a lot of charm when he wanted to show it, he knew his craft and was good at it. The movie also is resonant because we know what happened to Polonsky and Garfield as a result of the Communist witch hunts that overtook Hollywood during the late Forties and Fifties. Polonsky was an outspoken and enthusiastic Marxist. It's no accident that Force of Evil can be seen as a parable for Big Business squeezing out the hard-working little guys. When Polonsky refused to testify before the House un-American Activities Committee, his career vanished. He continued to write screenplays but only under assumed names. It took 21 years before he was permitted to direct another film. Garfield suffered perhaps a sadder fate. He came from a poor, working class background and had always been a strong supporter of the working man. He'd never been a Communist but he had supported liberal causes. Garfield was as politically naive as a deer who has a target tattooed on his side. He agreed to testify before HUAC but refused to offer any names of people the committee wanted to know were Communist sympathizers. He was unofficially blacklisted. He had become a major star in the Forties, but the job offers suddenly dried up. He made a couple of so-so movies, then tried to re-establish himself on Broadway.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Film-Noir"},{"date":"3 March 2008","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Joe Morse (John Garfield) is a smart, cocky New York lawyer, and as corrupt as they come. This is Wall Street, Joe tells us at the start of Force of Evil, and today was important because tomorrow, July Fourth, I intended to make my first million dollars. An exciting day in any man's life. Temporarily, the enterprise was slightly illegal. You see, I was the lawyer for the numbers racket. Joe has a problem. His older brother, Leo (Thomas Gomez), runs a neighborhood numbers operation. Leo is a decent small-timer with a bad heart who worked his tail off so that Joe could go to law school. He knows his brother for what Joe is, a slick legal crook. Joe is in partnership with a tough gangster, Ben Tucker. They plan to break the banks of the small numbers operations, then move in and consolidate them under their own hand. They'll make millions. Joe realizes his brother will be ruined and tries to save him. Events begin to spin out of Joe's ability to control them. Joe finally finds a conscience, but only after people die. There are a lot of elements that work in this movie. The screenplay by Abraham Polonsky and Ira Wolfert centers squarely on Joe's character and his dilemma. There's no let-up for Joe as his life of legal crime slides into real crime and tightens around him. The script is not exactly poetic, that would make it self-conscious, but it is tough, thoughtful and vivid. Polonsky's direction packs a lot of action into only 82 minutes. You need to pay attention, but it all makes sense. The movie looks gritty and bleak, from the crummy apartment where Leo runs his numbers operation to the empty New York streets at dawn to the sad but redemptive scene on the banks of the East River under the bridge. There are lots of low-angle shots that emphasize the essential emptiness of Joe's character. The movie also is well cast. Some of the actors I particularly enjoyed are Howland Chamberlain as a frightened, weak numbers accountant; Paul McVey as Joe's experienced law partner; Roy Roberts as Joe's business associate, Ben Tucker, a gangster who is more ruthless than Joe thought; and Marie Windsor in a small but memorable performance as Tucker's slow-talking, smoldering wife. More than anything, the movie depends on the excellent performances of John Garfield and Thomas Gomez. Gomez has to play a sick, excitable, overweight small-time crook who has a bedrock decency. The money I made in this rotten business is no good for me, Joe. he says. I don't want it back. And Tucker's money is no good either. Joe just looks at him. The money has no moral opinions, he tells Leo. Leo stares at his brother. I find I have, Joe. I find I have.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Film-Noir"},{"date":"3 March 2008","score":"","review":" I suppose on first viewing, Topsy-Turvy might seem like an odd choice for director Mike Leigh, who's previous films, such as Meantime, Life is Sweet and Secrets & Lies have looked specifically at real life archetypes, struggling to survive from day-to-day in the here and now. One scratch beneath the surface however will reveal a multitude of hidden depths that very much tie in with the themes of Leigh's early works whilst simultaneously demonstrating his strong understanding of character development and situations within the confines of a broad, ensemble narrative. Like the majority of Leigh's work, the film moves seamlessly from light comedy to moments of subdued tension and great pathos, whilst the focus of the film remains constantly with the characters and their varying relationships; with Leigh, as ever, favouring the stories presented by said characters and their associates, as opposed to the more obvious conventions of the biographical story at hand. Some have argued that Leigh's approach to the proceedings have turned Gilbert & Sullivan into caricatures, whilst also allowing the story to descend into a mire of fanciful farce. However, Leigh, like all great filmmakers, understands the notion of intertextuality, and sets about constructing his film so that it draws on the same visual and verbal characteristics as Gilbert & Sullivan's very own work, resulting in a film that is vibrant, colourful and, above all else, a great deal of fun.As a result of this, the film can be enjoyed on a number of levels. Firstly; as a biographical look into the working relationship of Gilbert & Sullivan during the conception and production of their celebrated comic-opera, The Mikado. Secondly; as a bittersweet character study, with Leigh creating the film in such a way that the whole theme, setting and back story can be seen as secondary to the drama at work between the characters. Thirdly; it is an analysis into the creative process, with Leigh offering an impeccable and seemingly accurate chronicle of life in the theatre and of course, that always interesting notion of films about the creative process (Day for Night, Ed Wood, Le Mepris, 8 ½, etc). Some viewers have found the story to be slight and disengaging, though I'd imagine this is from people who are unfamiliar with Leigh's films and his individual way of working (beginning with nothing and having the actors improvise their characters until the story and relationships develop) however, having said that, the use of the Mikado as a framing device is well handled, whilst the shifts in time (with flash forwards to the performances, whilst Gilbert & Sullivan create) and the inclusion of scenes from other G&S operas, the Sorcerer and Princess Ida, means that the film works well as an introduction into the work of Gilbert & Sullivan for those who've never experienced it (though surely everyone is familiar with such work as the HMS Pinafore and the song, Three Little Maids?). On top of this, there is that above-mentioned visual design that creates the world of the film (which is easily as beautiful as the similarly decadent, though overblown Moulin Rouge!) and the performances from all involved, which evoke both the real lives of the people documented, as well as offering compelling portrayals that engage on an interesting, narrative, level.The cast is a true ensemble of British acting talent, featuring Leigh regular Jim Broadbent as the strict and somewhat insular Gilbert - who is content to trot out the same plots, characters and themes, though feels deflated by critical misunderstanding - and the equally great Allan Corduner as the spirited yet slightly egocentric Sullivan, who feels trapped creatively by Gilbert's limited scope and overbearing vibratos. Added to this, we have an impeccable supporting cast, including Timothy Spall and Kevin McKidd as the pompous lead actors, Shirley Henderson as the alcoholic female lead, Ron Cook as the manager of the Savoy Theatre - who is left with the task of trying to re-unite Gilbert & Sullivan after their initial fall-out - Eleanor David as Sullivan's American mistress and the great Leslie Manville as Gilbert's long-suffering wife Kitty. Manville and Broadbent go to great lengths to portray the strained relationship between Gilbert and Kitty with a believability and depth, whilst the heartbreaking scene towards the end of the film in which Kitty manages to metaphorically convey all her inner-pain and desperation without Gilbert even realising is easily my favourite scene in the film (and ranks alongside other great scenes of Leigh-related-drama, such as the argument between Nicola and her mum in Life is Sweet and the penultimate confessional between Penny and Phil in All or Nothing). Added to this already starry cast, there are great cameos from other Leigh regulars such as Alison Steadman, Andy Serkis, Katrin Cartlidge, David Neville, Mark Benton and Dexter Fletcher, who all bring a comic savvy and wry believability to the often-neglected (though all-important) background action.Though Topsy-Turvy isn't a film for everyone (it's perhaps ten-minutes too long and demands a great deal of concentration in order to pick out the details) it is greatly rewarding; offering us a humorous, intelligent and interesting story with believable characters and some glorious cinematic design; all run through with that Mike Leigh world-weariness and the impeccable performances that are, on the whole, synonymous with his work. This film is a brave and bold departure from Leigh's usual blend of social-abstraction and, as a result, deserves to be evaluated alongside he other masterworks, Life is Sweet and Naked.

To me, they fulfill my expectations and they are not miscast. I do not think that anyone else could portray the main character as well as Al Pacino did. For the acting I would give ten points.The story is very convincing because we all know that the American Dream is all about making it from a dishwasher to a millionaire. The ending is well-developed. Probably, not everybody would have thought that Tony dies in the end. To me, the ending is very sad. For story and screenplay I would give nine points.The film provokes emotions. I think everyone should think about what Brian de Palma wants to say with this film. It is really entertaining and full of action, romance and funny scenes. I would give ten points for entertainment.38 out of 40 points!!

Most sci-fi movies were cheaply made in the 70s and had poor acting and things like that from what I can tell. Then Alien came along and sci-fi was changed from that point on. The acting here was first-rate and flawless. They used big-name actors to fill the parts in this movie such as Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Harry Dean Stanton and John Hurt. The only person who I thought was very annoying and poorly played was Veronica Cartwright's character, Lambert. I wanted her to be killed so she would shut up. Everyone else was perfect though. The story was excellent and well thought out. The costumes and FX were very good for 1979. I would recommend this movie for horror and sci-fi fans, you will enjoy it. 8\/10.

It is a superior film than the remake as usually the case. Where as Vanilla Sky was a much slicker production this one is much more story and character driven. A movie like this must be allowed to let the story unfold, and this version take its time to do so.The story is that of a man who seems to have everything now finds himself in a nightmarish situation, his face is destroyed and his freedom gone. He begins to question his reality and his sanity as he tries to sort things out with his Psychiatrist. The movie questions what is reality and is he really living it or dreaming it. With a premise like that, a movie needs to have a narrower focus. The problem I had with Vanilla Sky was that the direction and the production seems to have gotten in the way of the story. A convoluted story got more messed up because the director, the sound guys, set designers and the actors couldn't figure out when enough is enough. I've notice in a couple of other European thrillers of recent vintage that the same can be said, that less is more.The acting in this movie is very good. Eduardo Noriega playing the lead was very good so was Chete Lera who played the psychiatrist. They both played their roles so as not to overwhelm the story and get in the way. They have a much better chemistry than their U.S. counterparts. Lera especially showing genuine concern for his patient.Personally I wish I had not seen Vanilla Sky before this movie, because this movie tells the story so much better. Less slick but with better patience for the material something that I think is missing in American movies these days. I know that he's been getting terrible response lately but I think M. Night Shyamalan might have been a better choice as director for Vanilla Sky because he too allows his stories to unfold and not rush to the plot twist, just as Alejandro Amenábar did with this film.

Ten minutes in and I knew that Paul Thomas Anderson knows squat about the porn industry. The power is wielded not by the male performers, who are a dime a dozen, but by the female performers, who approve their on-screen partners.Anderson couldn't be bothered to do any character development, either. Why is the mother a harpie and the father a wuss? Why would Little Bill (another wuss) marry a nymphomaniac (another harpie), and assume that she'll be faithful? Why would she marry him? There is no hint of anything remotely like love between them, and his solution to his woes comes out of absolutely nowhere.How The Colonel's dalliances with underage girls is more repugnant than Jack recruiting an underage boy to have on-camera sex is beyond me, but when The Colonel is thrown into the poke, Jack suddenly gets a moral compass? Give me a break!How does the banker know that Buck does porn unless he was stupid enough to put that on his application? The donut shop scene was so silly and incredulous, I couldn't stop laughing!Amber wants her kid back, but does zip to show why she should regain custody! But not to worry, to Jack, she is still the foxiest bitch in the whole world. How sweet!Rollergirl drops out of school because some bozo makes a crude gesture, then proves why she is unworthy of the respect she thinks she deserves. To add insult to injury, she gets no foxiest bitch kudos from Jack.
