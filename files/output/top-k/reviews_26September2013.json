[{"date":"26 September 2013","score":"","review":" Nosferatu (1922)First time watch one, This is the oldest movie that I have seen now, I have been putting this off a few times as I have never seen Silent movie in full before and I not to keen on Vamps movie. Yesterday I did try to watch this in early morning before work but I could not get into for some reason , I did turn it off about 20 minutes into the movie. When I got back from work, I gave it another go in full this time. For being first Vampire movie, it was really good and some very cool creepy moments in this movie. I loved those shadow scenes. The vampire it's self was really creepy for time and for a PG movie and I didn't mind the whole reading scenes but when they were writing, I could not make some of handwriting which did bother me also I didn't like how scene were moved very slowly, It kinda of annoying. I don't think it was intended but I found the chase near the very end very funny and the ending was okay-ish for time.7 out of 10 it's was really good movie ","genre":null},{"date":"26 September 2013","score":"","review":" Nosferatu (1922)First time watch one, This is the oldest movie that I have seen now, I have been putting this off a few times as I have never seen Silent movie in full before and I not to keen on Vamps movie.
