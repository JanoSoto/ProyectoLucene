[{"date":"24 June 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Instinct (1999) Dir Jon Turteltaub \/ Cast Anthony Hopkins, Cuba Gooding Jr., Maura Tierney, Donald Sutherland, John Ashton It's Hannibal Lector in Africa comparing animal instincts to that of humans. Anthony Hopkins abandons his family to study gorillas in Africa. He abandons civilization and remains among gorillas for two years until he is taken prisoner for murder. Nothing is resolved in the nitwit conclusion and it would seem unfit that anyone would choose to live in the wild as oppose to be with their family. Family situation is loosely handled and the screenplay throws in unnecessary subplots including treatment of prisoners. It isn't surprising when Hopkins nearly kills an inmate due to mind screwing by guards. Directed by Jon Turteltaub who previously made two very different and more enjoyable films in While You Were Sleeping and Phenomenon. Hopkins is basically reciting his famed Lector role, which distracts any potential message. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays a flatly written psychiatrist who tries to make a difference. Maura Tierney is wasted as Hopkins's daughter who is destined to remain scratching her head at it all. Donald Sutherland is featured as a judge and that is a big reduction after all his great leading roles. More African footage would have been preferred over its blatant courtroom appeal. Trust your instincts and avoid this film.
