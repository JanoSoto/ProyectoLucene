Sulley is a top scarer who enters kids rooms through their closets & scares them so they will scream & Mike is his faithful assistant, however there is a power shortage & kids these days just don't scare easily. Late one night while sorting some paperwork out Sulley comes across a young child on the shop-floor, a shocking sight as great care is taken to make sure the kids never enter Monstropolis as the slightest of touches from just one child may be enough to kill a monster. Sulley has to hide the child from the authorities & find a way to get her back to her own room, however he discovers a sinister plot to kidnap lots of children from their bedrooms in an attempt to solve the energy crisis...Directed by Pete Docter, David Silverman & Lee Unkrich I personally think Monsters, Inc. is the greatest computer animated film I've ever seen & a film that I have great fondness for. The script by Andrew Stanton & Dan Gerson moves along seamlessly & has the perfect mix of humour, action & sentimentality. I loved the relationship between Sulley & little Boo as you can see him warming to her, surely this has to be one of the cutest & most likable on screen pairings ever, I think you would have to have a very cold heart not to feel a little bit of sadness at the end when Sulley has to say goodbye to Boo for the last time. They are also surrounded by some truly wonderful character's & friends, from the extremely funny Mike to his girlfriend Celia, from the slimy bad guy Randall & the adorable Abominable Snowman. I'm not a child, I'm not a teenager & by all counts the people around me keep saying I'm an adult but does that mean I can't enjoy a wonderful film such as this? Why do kids have all the fun? Quite frankly there is nothing that I don't like about this film, Monsters, Inc. is pure lovable brilliance from start to finish & it's as simple & straight forward as that.The director's do a great job, they fill just about every inch of the screen with fantastic detail & visual delights. There is so much going on in both the foreground, background & corners of the frame, for instance I loved the scene when the blob creature slid over the grate & accidentally oozed down into it plus Celia's individual snake hairdo whom all have personalities of their own & loads more besides. The character designs are the perfect blend between cuteness & sliminess, this being a Disney film everyone is big & cuddly but they have a weird gooey multiple eyes & tentacles everywhere look to them as well. It's obvious that a lot of time & effort went into the production of Monsters, Inc. including the fact that it normally took 11 to 12 hours to render a single fame of Sulley because they animated each of his 2.3 million hair strands individually! You know that literally boggles my mind just thinking about it.I can't quite believe that Monsters, Inc. had a budget of about $115,000,000, I love the film to bits but all that money?! Every frame is beautifully rendered & animated but why so much? Anyway, the film is an absolute delight to watch & for that sort of cash it should be. Nominated for & won lots of awards including winning an Oscar for Best Music & it lost out to Shrek (2001) on the Best Animated Feature which I am not having at all, Monsters, Inc. beats Shrek hands down as far as I'm concerned, there is no justice. The voice actors add so much to the film, Crystal & Goodman are perfect as are Steve Buscemi & the imposing sounding James Coburn as the villains, Jennifer Tilly makes for a squeaky & cute sounding love interest.Monsters, Inc. is just about faultless as far as I'm concerned & hopefully it will appeal to the child in most adults while I'm positive any child will enjoy it immensely. It's totally brilliant in every way, there's nothing else to say. More than deserves it's place on the IMDb Top 250 films list. Watch it as soon as you can, that's an order not a request.

The latter version is one of my all-time favorite movies. It compares quite favorably with Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings and is a modern classic.The theatrical release of 1986, shamefully butchered (chopped up and badly re-edited) by the mindless suits at Warner, and with its original Jerry Goldsmith score replaced by the rather trite Tangerine Dream soundtrack, is the version most people have seen. It was released on videotape as a children's movie. What it is, and was intended to be, is a fairy tale for adults. In fact, it's too intense for really young children.It's hard to say that the '86 version deserves any more than the 6 it's rated at on its IMDb main page. It is a disappointment, primarily because it's now impossible to watch without think how much better it could be. The feeling and tone of the film were ruined by its treatment.The Ridley Scott Director's Cut, released in 2002, is a completely different movie. If you haven't seen this version, you haven't seen the movie. It deserves a score of 9 or 10. It doesn't look like a movie made 20 years ago. Scenes which are vital to the tone of the film and the meaning of the story have been restored. The sumptuous original soundtrack, recorded with a full orchestra, has also been restored, and this adds more to the film than can be put into words. About the performances A very young Tom Cruise is excellent as the hero. Tim Curry as the Lord of Darkness is awesome; his costume and voice alone are worth the cost of renting or buying the DVD. Mia Sara is absolutely stunning as Lily. She actually plays two different versions of her character, both wonderfully. This was her first role, a risk for Scott on such a big budget film, and she turned in the performance of her career. She's never been better, or looked more beautiful, than in this movie. The elves and fairies, both good and evil, are incredibly real-looking and believable. The costumes are perfect, and the sets are breathtaking, literally. One of the largest indoor sets ever constructed - a huge fantasy forest - was built for this movie.If you haven't seen this version, rent it.

These reservations come with the territory though, and really come with any drama set in the court room, which is the simplicity of the little guy having to go up against an overwhelming force that pays its lawyers a thousand dollars an hour. Maybe not all court dramas, but I'm reminded of not just a possible Law & Order episode pulled out of a hat, but Lumet's the Verdict, and several other contemporary court story, however with circumstances shifted and the charges greater or lesser. Such is the case though with the 'overwhelming force' that in The Rainmaker comes with Great Benefits, an insurance company that denies claims made after their clients have already been duped into signing up for their company. And so Matt Damon, as Rudy Baylor, faces off against the company- and their main player Drummond- and added on top of this is the fact that Rudy, just out of law school and passing his exams, is on his first case.While he doesn't have the kind of personal baggage and demons that Paul Newman's character had in Lumet's film, Grisham's story gives Baylor the problem that comes with his 'love interest', played by Claire Danes. But it's a strange love interest that starts up, as he sees her as the victim of spousal abuse- triggering his own past of being in such a household- and it becomes a sort of tense situation that comes to a high peak with a really well done attack scene at night (it's strong precisely because Coppola, no pun intended, pulls no punches with this fight scene, as it's really graphic in how far it goes into the terror of a domestically violent climax). Aside from that, Baylor is really just the typically courageous young man looking to make the other side that he can't stand get what's coming to them- the other side being the lawyers he once thought just wouldn't accept him and realizes are just foul in their own manner. So the case then unfolds, in the sort of traditional Grisham style (if you've seen other Grisham thrillers or read the books you know what I mean), and of course one can sense the outcome a mile off.So why then is the Rainmaker so impressive if it seems to be bound by conventions of David more than likely conquering a Goliath (or would-be Goliath in this case)? More than anything because Coppola trusts that the audience will take this as a Hollywood picture, and almost something of an 'old-fashioned' one, so to speak, with some of the supporting characters sort of out of the ranks of past films (Teresa Wright is one of them, in her last role, as the old lady who lets Rudy have a room to rent out during his trial). Coppola also, with one exception, doesn't get in the way of telling a story that at it's core is entertaining in its simple form of the right versus wrong and the injustice of malpractice and greed being outshone. This exception is probably in the narration by Rudy, which is sometimes effective, but sometimes is also a little overbearing and- considering it's from Michael (Apocalypse Now) Herr- tells too much where Coppola could just as well show. But aside from just getting down a technically proficient and occasionally slick drama\/thriller, he casts terrifically, more than just type, as to all of the actors given their strengths and nature.Jon Voight is in one of his better roles in recent years as the dangerously smart and smarmy lawyer for the company; Mickey Rourke comes off quite well in his few scenes as a 'shark' lawyer type (the kind that doesn't stick around for the trial, as he's away somewhere nobody knows after a corruption scandal); Danny Glover as the judge, convincing without trying much at all; and smaller parts from Virginia Madsen (she might be my favorite, as the disgraced ex-employee of the insurance company) and Roy Scheider are made totally fleshed out through Coppola's direction and skills as a dramatist. Danny De Vito, however, makes his mark here more than anything, and is a great counterbalance to Damon's young and scared\/confident lawyer. There's even some sweet bits of light comedy that get put in, not much but just hints, at the charmingly sneaky ways that De Vito's not-quite lawyer character has. In the end, the ensemble really forms with the material, and it's ultimately a very watchable couple of hours. It might lack the harrowing impact of Coppola's best, to be sure, yet I would not think to pass it off as just a studio assignment either. He takes the material and his actors seriously, and it's a fine picture content to be itself- heartstrings and all- which may appeal to some more than others.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"25 December 2006","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Francis Ford Coppola knows the kind of motion picture he's making with The Rainmaker, adapted from one of the countless bestselling John Grisham novels, which means there are perks to be had here, however with some reservations. These reservations come with the territory though, and really come with any drama set in the court room, which is the simplicity of the little guy having to go up against an overwhelming force that pays its lawyers a thousand dollars an hour. Maybe not all court dramas, but I'm reminded of not just a possible Law & Order episode pulled out of a hat, but Lumet's the Verdict, and several other contemporary court story, however with circumstances shifted and the charges greater or lesser. Such is the case though with the 'overwhelming force' that in The Rainmaker comes with Great Benefits, an insurance company that denies claims made after their clients have already been duped into signing up for their company. And so Matt Damon, as Rudy Baylor, faces off against the company- and their main player Drummond- and added on top of this is the fact that Rudy, just out of law school and passing his exams, is on his first case.While he doesn't have the kind of personal baggage and demons that Paul Newman's character had in Lumet's film, Grisham's story gives Baylor the problem that comes with his 'love interest', played by Claire Danes. But it's a strange love interest that starts up, as he sees her as the victim of spousal abuse- triggering his own past of being in such a household- and it becomes a sort of tense situation that comes to a high peak with a really well done attack scene at night (it's strong precisely because Coppola, no pun intended, pulls no punches with this fight scene, as it's really graphic in how far it goes into the terror of a domestically violent climax). Aside from that, Baylor is really just the typically courageous young man looking to make the other side that he can't stand get what's coming to them- the other side being the lawyers he once thought just wouldn't accept him and realizes are just foul in their own manner. So the case then unfolds, in the sort of traditional Grisham style (if you've seen other Grisham thrillers or read the books you know what I mean), and of course one can sense the outcome a mile off.So why then is the Rainmaker so impressive if it seems to be bound by conventions of David more than likely conquering a Goliath (or would-be Goliath in this case)? More than anything because Coppola trusts that the audience will take this as a Hollywood picture, and almost something of an 'old-fashioned' one, so to speak, with some of the supporting characters sort of out of the ranks of past films (Teresa Wright is one of them, in her last role, as the old lady who lets Rudy have a room to rent out during his trial). Coppola also, with one exception, doesn't get in the way of telling a story that at it's core is entertaining in its simple form of the right versus wrong and the injustice of malpractice and greed being outshone. This exception is probably in the narration by Rudy, which is sometimes effective, but sometimes is also a little overbearing and- considering it's from Michael (Apocalypse Now) Herr- tells too much where Coppola could just as well show. But aside from just getting down a technically proficient and occasionally slick drama\/thriller, he casts terrifically, more than just type, as to all of the actors given their strengths and nature.Jon Voight is in one of his better roles in recent years as the dangerously smart and smarmy lawyer for the company; Mickey Rourke comes off quite well in his few scenes as a 'shark' lawyer type (the kind that doesn't stick around for the trial, as he's away somewhere nobody knows after a corruption scandal); Danny Glover as the judge, convincing without trying much at all; and smaller parts from Virginia Madsen (she might be my favorite, as the disgraced ex-employee of the insurance company) and Roy Scheider are made totally fleshed out through Coppola's direction and skills as a dramatist. Danny De Vito, however, makes his mark here more than anything, and is a great counterbalance to Damon's young and scared\/confident lawyer. There's even some sweet bits of light comedy that get put in, not much but just hints, at the charmingly sneaky ways that De Vito's not-quite lawyer character has. In the end, the ensemble really forms with the material, and it's ultimately a very watchable couple of hours. It might lack the harrowing impact of Coppola's best, to be sure, yet I would not think to pass it off as just a studio assignment either. He takes the material and his actors seriously, and it's a fine picture content to be itself- heartstrings and all- which may appeal to some more than others.

He is authentically disturbing, entirely becoming this awful man, transcending the universe. He does not play anything he does on screen. He is everything he does on screen. He lives and breathes his performance, and you realize that his portrayal runs so deep that it's no longer a performance in the traditional sense. It is haunting in a way that you must see to believe. I have never seen anything like it. There is a scene near the end of the film that makes me cringe reflexively, but all we really see is his silhouette.The opening shot---the dim, hazy slow-motion shadowboxing of LaMotta's shrouded figure, the tops of the judge's heads barely visible through the shadows of the background, out of which the sporadic flash of a bulb will momentarily disperse---is not even a moment in time so much as a corner sketch of a moment in time, playing on endlessly and savoring itself. And it's a moment of heightened reality in the routine of a boxer Those moments pumping up ringside before the fight begins. Scorsese manages to present his film with a moment so abstract and yet so pared down that many impressions such as mine can come of it. It's pure feeling.The character that proceeds to pervade every scene subsequent is not just a crass, angry man with hang-ups. From the moment we see this man's domestic life, the way he treats his miserable wife and loyal brother, we see abominable behavior and not a single redeeming value. It's what generates such a potent undercurrent of unease in his tender, tranquil first scenes with Vicki, his gorgeous 15-year-old future punching bag who is filmed like an unsullied angel and thus seen as one by this brute, who is for the first time we've seen acting polite, friendly and gentle. But when he gradually lures her into sitting on his lap, we see a controlling compulsion in romantic affection's clothing, much like the terrifyingly gentle, placid scene in Cape Fear between Juliette Lewis' coy teenage girl and another manipulative De Niro sociopath. It's the precise sort of tension Scorsese builds throughout his textile of LaMotta's vicious soul, an undercurrent of his true bleak colors beneath the uneasy serenity.The sudden, random violence that explodes incidentally and in the background of Jake's life is more than just part of a tableau of mean neighborhood streets of the New York Scorsese knows, as with other films in which he similarly uses shocks of realistic violence as a virtual aspect of production design. The shocking riot breaking out in the Cleveland match that opens the film, the brawls and arguments Jake and his brother pass by without reacting, the top-of-the-lungs fight Jake has with his wife ats which no one on the street bats an eye, these are the tableau of Jake's limited, insulated inner world. These are the things that he sees so regularly that his world can't make sense without it.It's not a story of boxer Jake La Motta's life. It's a story of Jake La Motta's congested aggression and debilitating sexual hang-ups and how they affected his career in the ring. He would fight like he didn't deserve to live. He would punish his opponents like they were the root of his paranoia and anguish, and he would take beatings and punish himself for what he'd done wrong. This is inarguably Scorsese's darkest film. It broods deeply, much quieter and much more claustrophobic than any other film he's made.

The entire film exists in a kind of prefabricated non-reality, where the characters are over-the-top, the action totally implausible and the colours deliberately garish and over-emphasised. Only when you accept these stylistic touches can you truly enjoy the film. Those who claim that the film is an insult to real westerns seem to be missing the point &#150; this film is intentionally spoofing the whole spaghetti western sub-genre, and consequently is MEANT to be stylized and far-fetched (even spaghetti classics like A Fistful Of Dollars and Once Upon A Time In The West were stylized and far-fetched, for goodness sake!!!)In the desert town of Redemption, various sharpshooters gather to compete in a quick draw championship. The winner will be showered with glory and great riches. But there doesn't seem to be much doubt about who the winner will be, since the reigning champion Herod (Gene Hackman) is one fast son-of-a-bitch when it comes to the quick draw.

Not much needs to be said other than it is truly great. This emotional film is a must see.Many may be turned away from the black & white film, but it works so well. From a technical standpoint, it works to give the impression of the late 1800's time period. It also helps with the make-up. If this were in color the make-up may have looked goofy or awkward. The black & white makes you believe this is a real person. It is also perfect in matching the tone of the film. It is a dark, depressing film and it is best suited that way in black & white. This movie would not have been as good in color.The acting is wonderful. John Hurt gives an outstanding performance. Great acting is the ability to make people forget who you are and believe that you are actually this character on screen. John Hurt does just that. Of course everyone here gives some of their finest performances ever, but the movie becomes so much more powerful when John Hurt is on screen.This is, in my opinion, David Lynch's best film. The style of The Elephant Man is very similar to Eraserhead from a few years earlier. The Elephant Man has the very strong visuals, only this time Lynch has strengthened his skill by being more subtle than overdoing it. The Elephant Man compared to Eraserhead is an example that being simple is as powerful as being unique.The Elephant Man is a very emotional film. It is nearly impossible to not feel emotion when John Merrick is first revealed or during the last sequence of this film with John Merrick sitting in his room. Every emotion you feel while viewing this movie are identical to what John Merrick is feeling throughout. By the end of The Elephant Man you will feel the same satisfaction that John Merrick feels in the last scene.

Not much needs to be said other than it is truly great. This emotional film is a must see.Many may be turned away from the black & white film, but it works so well. From a technical standpoint, it works to give the impression of the late 1800's time period. It also helps with the make-up. If this were in color the make-up may have looked goofy or awkward. The black & white makes you believe this is a real person. It is also perfect in matching the tone of the film. It is a dark, depressing film and it is best suited that way in black & white. This movie would not have been as good in color.The acting is wonderful. John Hurt gives an outstanding performance. Great acting is the ability to make people forget who you are and believe that you are actually this character on screen. John Hurt does just that. Of course everyone here gives some of their finest performances ever, but the movie becomes so much more powerful when John Hurt is on screen.This is, in my opinion, David Lynch's best film. The style of The Elephant Man is very similar to Eraserhead from a few years earlier. The Elephant Man has the very strong visuals, only this time Lynch has strengthened his skill by being more subtle than overdoing it.
