As a 16 year old who has matured and understands things better, I have to say that this is one of my favorite movies. I have tuns of reasons of this movie appealing to me that it will probably take me forever to list them all. The director and writer is brilliant to having come up with this movie. The movie is actually a reflection of America and different people's views on things and how they really are in inside. whoever says this movie is stupid and pointless is missing the point. The way the movie was made and how the actors act is just making the point more obvious. It's not just about the message of the movie, but also how it was made and how the actors act and the music for this movie made this movie very interesting and entertaining. The violence in this movie made it more real. I bet a lot of people say that it's too violent and stuff like that but they actually need to grow up and get over it, and some other commentor said that just because it's unique doesnt mean it's good, well just because it's unique doesnt mean it's bad either. I especially praise the music for the movie, because it makes the movie more impacting. The people who actually has the time to think (or the ability for that matter) will probably think this movie is worth watching. Yes it can be disturbing, but that factor makes the movie better. This movie is great and should have better praise then what I've seen in this website so far.

Well, the results proved that HALLOWEEN is still the best horror film in the opinion of many many fans. A great achievement if you know the runner ups were absolute classics like Psycho and the Exorcist to name only a few. And that's more than right, I think. 25 years after its release this film still is the ultimate thrill. Michael Myers still has the power to scare the hell out of you. The horrible music, by director John Carpenter himself, still makes the hair on the back of your neck rise like nothing else does.I'm pretty sure everyone knows the story already. And yes, it IS the most simple and predictable story ever written. But so what. It works a whole lot better than many other intelligent horror films so what the heck if it's a goofy story. A very disturbed child kills his sister at the age of six and is locked away under strong supervision since then. 15 years later, he escapes and returns to his hometown, Haddonfield. He sets his mind to a local babysitter and he starts to terrorize her and her friends. That's it. But it works on so many levels. If you don't like this film, fine. But at least you've got to admit the status this movie reached is very respectable.

With the right atmosphere ( lights out, the TV loud ) I assure you, you'll be scared as hell. Not only thriller fans enjoy this film. It also has a lot of extra values attached to it. For example when the credits say  introducing Jamie Lee Curtis  This film made her famous and now, 25 years later, she still stars in the sequels.

I'm by far not the typical popcorn movie watcher, and I don't always listen to reviews of movies because everyone is different. Remember, my words are opinions, not facts. Here's the lowdown on American PsychoThis movie is based on the novel of the same name. I don't know why everyone likes to say It wasn't as good as the book or The book was better than the movie or vice versa. You people need to realize books and movies are two different types of entertainment! You aren't smarter cause you read the book and you aren't dumber for watching the movie! That would be like comparing a video game about a glass of orange juice to an actual glass of orange juice! It's ridiculous!Now that my rant is over, here's what the movie is about. The movie takes place in the 1980's, and Patrick Bateman is this corporate lawyer who has a secret obsession for killing people. He tries to balance his feelings for brutal sexual and violent carnage with his obsession to be like everyone else and fit in. The movie is a satirical look on society, and the need to fit in even if you are different. I won't spoil the movie, but I will say there is somewhat of a twist to the ending so watch it carefully.The cinematography was pretty good, as well the direction of all the characters. Bateman is one of the best performances in the movie, and Christian Bale will definitely take you on a wild ride through his character's life of over-obsession, the lust for carnage, as well as a bizarre addiction to 1980's pop music such as Huey Lewis and the News and Whitney Houston. The whole Hey Paul, CATCH! scene is brilliant, as well as the Not in the face you F***ing B**ch! chainsaw massacre part which is quite hilarious. Tennis shoes, nakedness, and chainsaws really work in this movie! If you are lost, watch the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about. Witherspoon, however, needs to play less ditsy blond roles and try some more intelligent roles, or else she's going to be stereotyped. Bale and Witherspoon provide some of the funniest lines in the movie, and I loved the excuse for returning videotapes. This film is black humor at its best!I haven't read the book yet, but I do own it.

People need to realize that the book and the movie should be completely separate.

I did not know what to expect. Their opinions of movies tend to differ alot to mine but they were well on for this one. I have to say when i thought about it before i watched it i was under the impression that the action would not be that good as its set in a prison. How wrong i was! The fact is that this movie has now become my favourite action movie to date. It has everything from non-stop action to terrific characters, a terrific story, terrific actors and some very funny lines. This has to be my favourite movie by Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer to date although i haven't seen Bad Boys 2 yet but i rather doubt i will change my mind. The action is amazing with memorable scenes being a terrific car chase, some brilliant shoot-outs at the prison and some great fight sequences and explosions. Sean Connery and Nicolas cage make a great team and both characters are likeable along with the bad guy Ed Harris as he is not evil, but a guy with a good motive and he is also not a guy who just wants money for him and his guys. Michael Bay should be directing more action movies than disaster movies like Armeageddon and Pearl harbour as they have great action but are overlong and lack a good story and good characters. This movie and Bad Boys were good as they contained great characters and great action which i think he can do best. In conclusion I have to say a huge thank you to Jonathan Hensleigh     ( Die hard 3 and Armeageddon) for writing this movie. He is completely uncredited and very few people know he re-wrote the whole script for this movie but i think he did an outstanding job and should have been credited for his hard work on the script and his contribution to action movies. His over ones which he re-wrote include Con Air and Gone in 60 seconds which he was credited for but not as a writer. I feel so sorry for him though and i cannot wait till his next movie The Punisher comes out. Don't worry Jonathan I will support you all the way! e-mail me if you like! You are the best action movie writer in the business!

This movie and Bad Boys were good as they contained great characters and great action which i think he can do best. In conclusion I have to say a huge thank you to Jonathan Hensleigh     ( Die hard 3 and Armeageddon) for writing this movie. He is completely uncredited and very few people know he re-wrote the whole script for this movie but i think he did an outstanding job and should have been credited for his hard work on the script and his contribution to action movies. His over ones which he re-wrote include Con Air and Gone in 60 seconds which he was credited for but not as a writer. I feel so sorry for him though and i cannot wait till his next movie The Punisher comes out. Don't worry Jonathan I will support you all the way! e-mail me if you like!

I did not know what to expect. Their opinions of movies tend to differ alot to mine but they were well on for this one. I have to say when i thought about it before i watched it i was under the impression that the action would not be that good as its set in a prison. How wrong i was! The fact is that this movie has now become my favourite action movie to date. It has everything from non-stop action to terrific characters, a terrific story, terrific actors and some very funny lines. This has to be my favourite movie by Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer to date although i haven't seen Bad Boys 2 yet but i rather doubt i will change my mind. The action is amazing with memorable scenes being a terrific car chase, some brilliant shoot-outs at the prison and some great fight sequences and explosions. Sean Connery and Nicolas cage make a great team and both characters are likeable along with the bad guy Ed Harris as he is not evil, but a guy with a good motive and he is also not a guy who just wants money for him and his guys.

Many have complained that it started out slow and then became fun. I am of a different mind. I think it starts off just right and slumps into a ponderous action film. Though I appreciated the ridiculously long fight scene, I think it would have done better in another film.I have read that Carpenter wanted to make a film slamming unrestrained capitalism but not be too preachy. In doing so he goes against what the main character warns against `The white line's in the middle of the road. That's the worst place to drive.' Be preachy! He had the chance to really ram the dagger home into the heart of the yuppie\/Reaganomics ideology, but held back. A lot said in this movie rings true today We gave the steel companies a break when they needed it. Know what they gave themselves? Raises. Things maybe worse today. Companies like Enron not only lay off everyone and give themselves raises but they stole from their employees too. There's a scene in They Live where a man missing a leg is rolling out of the welfare office shaking his head. Recently, here in my home state, it took a man who lost both of his legs at work 8 years to get his social security disability. The film has such a wonderful premise that I wanted explored as thoughtfully as the set up was. Not that I want it to loose its humor. I would have liked to have heard jokes more pointed at the unrestrained capitalism Carpenter is satirizing rather than the general action film one-liners. I would even like to see John Carpenter re-make this film in that way, but I'm sure that I'm way out numbered by the people who want more aliens blasted, faster. I love action too but it can be done with considerable intelligence. Case in point John Carpenter's masterpiece The Thing.Roddy Piper delivers an excellent performance when he is given intelligent dialogue but seems somewhat awkward when delivering lines like the famous `I have come here to kick a** and chew bubble gum&#133;' line (which, once again, I liked, but would have preferred in another movie). The problem is that the transition between everyday man to action hero is way too abrupt and I even get the sense that Roddy Piper feels that way too. The character goes from introspective to wisecracking on the turn of a dime. The introspective Nada was far more intriguing. A logical transition from introspective to wisecracking may have been intriguing also, as well as a deeper look into the resistance movement and the black and white real world. Carpenter has a real knack for filming black and white scenes. The aliens advancing on Piper in the grocery store is brief but unsettling. I wanted more. The movie was done on a low budget ($3 million) so I appreciate the limitations  (keep an eye out for a prop from Ghostbusters used as an alien walkie-talkie). But this is also why I'd like to see it re-made with a bigger budget so it can explore this idea more. *Spoiler* Briefly, I'd also like to air my dislike for `instant revolutions'. It was not exigent that the aliens in They Live be defeated within 70 minutes of me finding out about them. The Running Man and Demolition Man are some other movies guilty of this blatant attempt to instantly gratify the crowd and it almost invariably always fails. It took 3 films to destroy the empire in the Star Wars saga and it looks like 3 films is what it's gonna take to destroy The Matrix. Over all the movie feels like two different scripts spliced together. It is filmed with delightful satire in the beginning but detours into an action film and briefly becomes satire again. I think Carpenter had a lot to say but played it safe. I left the theater in 1988 feeling somewhat let down. But still I have seen They Live again countless times because it is a timeless gem despite its flaws. The extent to which we let capitalism run unchecked and the consequences of living in a hyper-Darwinistic world are things we will always have to deal with.

He reasons that all things that seem random can be broken down into simpler pieces until you arrive at something deep down that is common to all patterns.I think here is where a lot of people go wrong in the movie.

My theory is that the reason we can not know the 216 digit number is that it cannot be written down or understood because it would then be a part of itself. Since the number explains all sequences.

It's as if he senses that the jig is up for his deadly serious Universal legacy and he gives a delightfully passionate and desperate performance.  Lugosi is older and worn, compared with his passionate magnificence in Dracula.  However, he was born to play this part and he's still good and very commanding.  Strange, apparently one the most genuinely nice people in Hollywood history, has his biggest turn as the monster and gets to be more physical for longer periods then in the past.  Lenore Aubert is great in her role as she comes off as distant and elusive, making her mysterious.  McDougal gives the movie a great shot in the arm for his scenes.  Abbott and Costello are very aggressive in this movie, recalling their glory days in movies like Buck Privates, which is interesting because it is documented that they didn't want to do the movie.  There are several firsts in the movie relating to the Universal monsters.  Dracula commands the monster for the first time in the series and Dracula and the Wolfman fight each other for the first time. Universal horror movies had my favorite sets of any movies I have seen and this movie is no exception.  The gothic horror movies are mythic in black and white.  The end sequence is also a blast.  The DVD for this movie has a fascinating narration on one version by a film historian that tells the behind the scenes story of the movie as it is playing.  Info such as Abbott's epileptic seizures on the set and Chaney's battles with alcoholism are provided.  And any discussion of a movie that provides a story of Gary Cooper, Ray Milland and others going to a brothel is too good to pass up. If you like Universal horror or Abbott and Costello or both, it is a must to hear.

After you see Alien Resurrection you'll agree that gore has the most screen time in this pathetic excuse for a movie.The 'story' focuses on Ripley being 'resurrected' (or cloned, but they decided to go with a biblical reference) because the company needs the alien to use as a weapon.

But after a while I grew bored with it - the show seemed to be a one trick pony, and unlike The Simpsons it seemed it could only be funny when it was being offensive, even though I admired a TV show which went out of it's way to offend as many people as possible. So I didn't see South Park Bigger, Longer & Uncut in a theatre. And that is something I've regretted ever since I saw the film on video, because it is quite simply 1) the best comedy I have ever seen; 2) along with Monty Python's Life of Brian and Dr. Strangelove, the best satire I've ever seen; and 3) the best musical I have ever seen. What, I hear you ask, the best musical I've ever seen? Better than Moulin Rouge or The Producers? You bet. Leaving aside for a moment the content of the lyrics, rarely can a film have featured so many instantly catchy songs, even if the majority of them are only 1 minute long. Their short length is actually a strength, making them more memorable and stopping the obscene content of the lyrics from seeming too gratuitous. Of course, the songs deliberately rip off virtually every other musical going, from Les Miserables to Disney's The Little Mermaid, but again this is a strength - all the melodies sound vaguely familiar, which makes the lyrics sound even more inappropriately funny. Actually the songs are almost like a form of punk, with their short length and ripped off melodies. And of course the lyrics. I would say at least 50% of what makes this film so hysterically funny and gloriously offensive are the songs. In particular What Would Brian Boitano Do?, Blame Canada, the La Resistance medley and Kyle's Mom's a B***h are brilliant, but standing head and shoulders above them all, at least in terms of offensiveness and being infectiously catchy is the now legendary Uncle F***a. Make no mistake, you will be singing this tune out loud for at least two weeks after seeing the movie, often in the most inappropriate places. Trey Parker and Matt Stone must have realised the effect the song would have, as the film even makes a joke out of the its catchiness, with the boys constantly singing it out loud in class, on the street, etc.As I said above, at least 50% of the comedy in this film probably comes from the songs, but that doesn't mean the other 40-odd% is any way substandard. Yes, most of it is based around deliberately gratuitous swearing and purposefully trying to offend as many people as possible, but this is necessary for the film's satire to work (more on this in a moment). The film's short running time means that the jokes come far thicker and faster than even in the likes of Airplane. I don't want to spoil any of it, but I will just say this - you will never have laughed so long or so hard as you will do on seeing this film. You will be sore laughing. Your head will hurt from laughing. I'm laughing thinking about the film as I type this.  South Park is so way out beyond the pale in terms of offensiveness that it would probably still be funny even if there was no point to it. But undoubtedly what elevates the film above other bad taste comedies to the level of a true classic is the satirical content. Of course there's the obvious satire of parent's blaming TV for their kid's behaviour instead of paying more attention to their offspring, but the film also riffs heavily on US foreign policy. Actually, for a film made four years before the current Gulf War, the film is frighteningly current - the US invades a country without UN backing and a comedy Saddam Hussein is cast as being in league with the Devil - axis of evil, anyone?In summary, so long as you can stand an f word count of well over 100, not to mention over two hundred other profanities, numerous references to obscene sexual practices and bucketloads of gore in the war scenes, you owe it to yourself to give this film a chance - don't let the deliberately rubbish animation or your views of the TV show put you off, because otherwise you'll be missing out on the funniest 80 minutes in cinema history.Rating - 9\/10    ","genre":null},{"date":"28 July 2003","score":"","review":"  *******some spoilers************When South Park first appeared on TV, I thought it was one of the funniest things I'd ever seen, and for a short while it even replaced The Simpsons as my all time favourite TV show.

I finally got around to watching this recently and I have to say I think I've found the perfect way to enjoy any movie. First, you have to listen to all the negative reviews of the film, then go and see it. You'll be expecting something so dire that the reality will be a pleasant surprise, nay, even enjoyable. Such was the case with MIB2.That said, though, this has to be one of the most blatant let's redo the first movie sequels that I've ever seen. Let's recap...In the first movie the MIB have to recover the galaxy on Orion's belt or the Earth will be destroyed. The love interest comes in the form of a morgue worker who falls for Will Smith. There's a big-ass alien monster that the MIB have a showdown with at the end. There's a scene with the MIB's car flying.In this sequel the MIB have to recover the light of Zartha or the Earth will be destroyed. The love interest comes in the form of a waitress who falls for Will Smith. There's a big-ass alien monster that the MIB have a showdown with at the end.

A very haunting and beautiful movie (even though it gives a very unpleasant view of life), with a haunting snake charm style score and starring the brilliant Elias Koteas (from Crash) and the lovely Mia Kirshner (from early first season 24 and The Crow City Of Angels). Victor Garber (Sidney's dad in Alias) also has a couple of scenes. Not to many tastes but very rewarding if you can appreciate it (although it's sense of detachment probably puts off a lot of people).It seems to me to explore the theme of people trying to connect, in a very insular and ultimately unfulfilling way (the young gay man who goes to the ballet every night and gives away his extra ticket for companionship or the grieving father who pays a young girl to babysit his empty house so that he can have the illusion his daughter is still around for example), and also the theme of loss (variously of loved ones, innocence, youth, opportunity etc). The Exotica strip club seems such hollow place but at the same time it seems almost understandable that it would draw hapless souls night after night with nowhere else to go.

Others may be turned off because of the period of time in which the story takes place.But I would like to tell those people that these elements are what ADDS to the movie. I think Glenn Close's character (Merteuil) was much more heartless than Cruel Intentions' Catherine. Why? Because Mertueil was giving advice and misleading Cecile-- a girl possibly between the ages of 16 to 18 (?) and above all things, Cecile is part of her FAMILY! I think Cecile was the daughter of Madame de Volanges and Volanges was Mertueil's cousin.Now, considering those factors don't you think that sounds heartless enough? Merteuil is noticably much more OLDER than Cecile. And for her to be playing games like that and misleading someone so much younger is just plain wrong. In Cruel Intentions, Catherine misleads Cecile but their age differences leave little impact. It appears as if Catherine is a senior of her prep school and is just misleading a freshman. And the only personal resentment Catherine has of her is because her boyfriend fell for Cecile.Another element that I like from DL is the language and implied sexuality. In Cruel Intentions, everything is so blatant-- the dialogue and the sex. What DL offers is cleverness. For example, when Valmont comes into Cecile's bedroom, he says something to the likes of I'm going to teach you some Latin and moves between her legs. The scene fades and opens up with a church scene where the priest is speaking Latin. How funny is that? I can't remember much else of the dialogue but I can assure you it is smart and brilliant. And the cast are much better actors (except for Keanu Reeves).Glenn Close does a marvelous portrayal of Merteuil and the time period she is from makes it more interesting. Merteuil looks for independance in a time where most women were marked by their silence and confined to the indoors. In Cruel Intentions, Catherine has little or nothing to complain about. She has looks, wealth, and an education at a fine school. Her having sex or having drugs is nothing of suprise since the story takes place in modern times.

For example, when Valmont comes into Cecile's bedroom, he says something to the likes of I'm going to teach you some Latin and moves between her legs. The scene fades and opens up with a church scene where the priest is speaking Latin. How funny is that? I can't remember much else of the dialogue but I can assure you it is smart and brilliant. And the cast are much better actors (except for Keanu Reeves).Glenn Close does a marvelous portrayal of Merteuil and the time period she is from makes it more interesting. Merteuil looks for independance in a time where most women were marked by their silence and confined to the indoors. In Cruel Intentions, Catherine has little or nothing to complain about. She has looks, wealth, and an education at a fine school. Her having sex or having drugs is nothing of suprise since the story takes place in modern times.  ","genre":"Drama, Romance"}]
