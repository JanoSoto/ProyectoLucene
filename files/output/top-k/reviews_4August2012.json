What I really like about the movie is the depth of feeling Borgnine (Marty) and Blair (Clara) manage without going over the top. Together, they show how a drab exterior can conceal a compelling inner person without the person's knowledge. Thus, Clara and Marty, following a lifetime of social slights, blossom in one another's company, revealing at last the charming inner person that each is. For me, it's Clara's plain-Jane plight that is most affecting. After all, Marty as a man has many pro-active options denied to drab school teacher Clara. Instead, her string of rejections are ones that as a woman she is required to somehow passively endure. Thus, seeing her genuinely smile in the company of Marty's affection is one of our cynical silver screen's finer moments.But the movie goes against more than just Hollywood glamour. TV of the 50's famously idealized the family in pretty unrealistic fashion, e.g. Ozzie & Harriet, Father Knows Best, etc. Not that these shows were not entertaining in their own right, but they did present a pretty strong contrast to family life as it's actually lived, (the sitcom All in the Family finally broke TV's idealized mold in 1971). This is certainly not the case with Marty's family. Clearly, they're not much help, at all. Cousins Virginia and Tommy quarrel constantly, while Tommy reneges on giving Marty the financial advice he promised. At the same time, Aunt Catherine complains about anything and everything, while Mom rejects the not pretty Clara thanks to Aunt Catherine's malign influence. No doubt about it, this is a long way from an Ozzie & Harriet version of the American family. But it's also a family that viewers could watch, relate with, and not feel inferior to.So, when Marty at last picks up the phone to call Clara, it's his declaration of independence from the rut he's been in, not just the rut of his unhelpful family but from his dead-end buddies, as well. Clearly, the guys lean on one another for the fraternal support each needs in the absence of anything more than a physical connection with the opposite sex. Thus, it's another sublime movie moment when Marty breaks free of that joyless dependency with the simple act of picking up the phone.Kudos to writer Chayefsky for the first-rate story and screenplay. I really like the way he provides motivation to even the least likable characters. And how astute of the producers to film on New York location to help give the story its realistic feel. I guess my only complaint doesn't come from the movie itself. Rather it comes from Hollywood's big ballyhoo machine. As I recall, the industry went into near paroxysms congratulating itself on recognizing such a lowly little b&w with a string of Oscars. The ballyhoo was self-serving at best, and of course the industry went back to 50's form the following year with the Technicolor extravaganza, Around the World in 80 Days (1956).But industry aside, Marty remains a wonderfully affecting little movie, with Oscar-worthy performances from both Blair and Borgnine. Happily, their characters project genuine pathos without also becoming pathetic, a real necessity to the story's success. Nor, for that matter, does the story ever descend to a sappy level, always a pitfall for films of this type. It's features such as these that help make the movie as compelling now as it was so many years ago.(In passing&#x97; Over the years, I've seen a ton of movies, good, bad and in-between.

They didn't leave any fingerprints so there's no proof they were ever there.

Miles and Becky are forced up into the hills and when they separate for a moment, Miles looks into Becky's eyes and sees nothing there.

Soon this unknown man escapes from a mental hospital and sure enough he heads to the sorority house where he starts killing the girls and boys there. SORORITY HOUSE MASSACRE features just about everything you'd want from a slasher but even its clichés are clichés. I remember renting this movie as a teenager, you know, back during the years when if a movie had nudity or violence then it was cool in my book but even this one struck me as being bad back then.

Around the release of H20, the horror industry was in an interesting time. Scream had reinvigorated the slasher (and horror in general) film at the box office. Horror movies were making money and doing well and being talked about. But unlike the original era of slasher films, where they dominated the box office for over a decade, the slasher as king didn't last nearly as long.In 1999, one movie came out that reshaped the face of horror. And like the original Halloween in 1978, it was a low budget independent film that went on to break box office records. This movie was The Blair Witch Project and it scared audiences to the tune of $140,000,000, an unheard of number for the type of film it was.Blair Witch was a found footage, faux documentary horror film. The camera was hand held and shaky and was controlled by the characters in the film. It was shot on film and video and it had a simple story. And like 1978's Halloween, it had no gore, no special effects, a simple story and about an hour and a half of sheer terror. That's not to say the slasher film didn't play it's part at the movies. A new Friday the 13th (although now they were 'Jason' movies) film was released, a third Scream came out and a new original slasher style film came out called Final Destination. Horror was doing well and on July 12th, 2002 Halloween returned to the big screen.Halloween Resurrection follows the continuing story of H20, and like that film it ignores parts four to six. It turns out that Laurie had chopped off the wrong person's head, not Michael's. Technically this doesn't make sense based on the behaviour of the man behind the mask in the last 10 minutes of H20, but as a Halloween fan, sitting in the audience, one can let it go.Resurrection goes on to wrap up the story of Michael and his sister and introduces a new story line. Michael returns home to Haddonfield, to his house and finds a reality game show being filmed there. Hence he has to knock off the people in his house, one by one and in increasingly gruesome ways. The reality game show allows for Resurrection to throw in a bit of a Blair Witch influence. Each character in the house gets their own camera and thus the view switches back and forth between shaky, video style footage and nicely framed, smooth film footage.This makes for an interesting idea, and some cool scenes with Michael making his way through the halls and not being noticed by anyone except the audience, but overall Resurrection fails as a movie. First and foremost it fails because it is not scary. Myers himself works pretty well, he seems looming and scary, he walks the right way and he has the creepy head tilt, but once again he no longer looms in the background for very long. He's always clearly visible and ready to strike. Technically, for Resurrection's given story, this makes sense, but it doesn't work for the scare factor.Like Halloween II, this film is directed by Rick Rosenthal. When he made part two he had taken Michael Myers and made him less of a realistic monster. He made the second Halloween a film filled with jump scares and didn't capture the tension that the original did. And following H20, he does the same thing here. But it isn't only the lack of terror that makes Resurrection ultimately fail. The story is plain and generic (although the first 10 minutes with Jamie Leigh Curtis are pretty good) and the dialogue is pretty poor. Most of the actual dialogue sounds fake and expositional, where the characters instead of sounding like they are talking to each other end up having conversations that spell out the story for the audience.The acting for the most part is okay. The acting by the staff at the hospital is sub par but all the leads do a pretty decent job. Although his performance isn't bad, Busta Rhymes does end up sinking the movie some what. His character says some really stupid things and in one scene he does some really cheesy and out of place kung fu poses and noises before he drop kicks Michael Myers. What was Rosenthal thinking when he included that?Another really strange omission is a wide shot of the Myer's house. Although it sounds small, a wide shot to show the outside of the house would of helped the atmosphere of the film in many ways. For example, seeing the Myer's house in a wide shot, establishing to the audience that they were back to where it all began could of built up tension, but for some inexplicable reason, all the audience ever gets is interior shots and quick close ups of various outside features. The film is rather well shot, with great choreography and editing, especially when you take into account that in addition to the film cameras, there were the six or seven video cameras that were used throughout the film. So the film does flow nicely and never really leaves the audience bored. But when all is said and done, and the end credits start to roll, especially after H20, Halloween Resurrection sadly end ups leaving one with a strong and overbearing feeling of disappointment.Film Rating 64%Breakdown (How Halloween Resurrection scored 64%)Production Design 7 out of 10 Cinematography 7 out of 10 Re-playability 6 out of 10 Originality 6 out of 10 Costumes 7 out of 10 Directing 6 out of 10 Editing 7 out of 10 Acting 7 out of 10 Music 7 out of 10 Script 4 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 August 2012","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Halloween H20 20 Years Later ended up being the best of the sequels in the Halloween saga.

Here, after Tim's huge step forward, Joel decides to take one huge monumental leap backward into the high-camp and often hilarious 60's years. The result is a film that is amazingly bad, but so bad that it's absolutely hilarious and thus very entertaining. Don't watch Batman & Robin expecting something with substance. Thank the lord that Christopher Nolan has revolutionised the franchise again more recently! What makes this film so funny is the all-star cast. We've got George Clooney who is totally mis-cast as Batman, Uma Thurman playing an absolutely ridiculous role as a woman who kills people by snogging them and best of all... Arnold Schwarzenegger. Playing the camp Mr.Freeze with a performance even more frozen than that big freeze gun he's got. I don't know how these big names looked at that appalling script and said yep, that looks like something I'd do because the script is awful.We've got a Mr.Freeze randomly appearing in a freeze suit and big freeze gun, but very little explanation is given to why he's so hot on the cold. He also spurts out an endless amount of cold puns chill out! and the likes, which are hilarious, especially the way Arnie delivers them in that monotone voice of his. Poisen Ivy is also randomly created by falling into some plant chemicals, as well as a completely useless villain called Bane (I hope Bane's not this much of a moron in The Dark Knight Rises which I've yet to see). Poisen Ivy's powers result to blowing some pink fog at men and being instantly seduced. Leading to an absolutely hilarious rivalry between Batman and Robin.Robin is such an idiot. Batman even points this out to him by saying she's trying to kill you Dick! But Robin is ashamed of being in Batman's shadow. Robin wants his own show, and thinks that Batman's jealous because Poisen Ivy fancies him and not Batman. Robin is also presented as a complete pervert. Constantly googling Batgirl and the other women in the film. The film is actually largely sexist, there's even a moment where rich old men are bidding for some young women. As well as a long take on Batgirl's arse (and on Batman's and Robin's) and her suit even has Madonna-sized boobs! Although that's nothing compared to the batsuit's nipples.The directing is just as awful as everything else. Not only is there a villain overload, but there's a hero overload to. There's far too many close-ups and long-shots on the action that are cut so quickly it's impossible to know what's going on! All the sets look incredibly fake too, it looks more like a stage-production than a film with its vibrant colours and smoke-effects. Small children would be enthralled (I know I was). There's also a head ache inducing bombastic score being constantly played throughout the film. It's insane! When no music was playing it was some-what deafening! I remember loving Batman & Robin when I was about seven years old. So my sister and I decided to revisit it for laughs and we certainly got those. The highlight for me was probably Arnie being carried into Arkham Aslyum in a fridge by two guards who take him to a cell that has a cold beam right above his bed. It's made purely for laughs and isn't supposed to serious (I hope). Although it's over-long and sexist with far too many innuendo's I think small children would find its vibrant colours and sounds enchanting. Whereas the parents can just laugh at it.

A kid whose schoolwork comes naturally to him and grades were never something to sweat over. But instead of trying to lead an ambitious life, Shaun chooses to spend his days surfing and hanging out with his pals. But when his best friend Lonny is killed in a surfing accident, Shaun contemplates if this direction is the best one to pursue. He later discovers a novel, written by a man named Marcus Skinner, on the beach one day, reads it cover to cover, and loves every minute of it. Upon reading it a dozen more times, and practicing writing similar stories on his own, he realizes that he has a talent for writing and ultimately that's what he wants to become.Shaun's homelife is a rather strange one. His parents are divorced, with his mother (Catherine O'Hara) being a sensitive, needy woman and his father (John Lithgow) a selfish and unruly cad. Shaun's brother is Lance (Jack Black), a portly stoner who is rarely seen fully clothed. Lance continues to offer advice to Shaun, which he will inherently disregard as rambling with no meaning, yet this isn't one of those stories where the dopey character may actually be smarter than we believe. He's just dumb.Our hero's dream, however, is to get accepted to Stanford and major in journalism. His girlfriend, the neighborhood activist Ashley (Schuyler Fisk) is all support, but his chances seemingly plummet downward when his guidance counselor sends the wrong transcript to Stanford. Instead of the bright and dedicated student they should receive, the school accepts some ne'er-do-well stoner who applied on a whim.Orange County follows Shaun as he tries in every which way to get accepted to Stanford and pursue a life of intellect and creativity. One thing that becomes the top priority on his list is escaping the inherently listless and seemingly mundane town of Orange County, where nobody takes anything with an ounce of seriousness and everyone seems to be self-indulgent and careless.This is a film with a big agenda, a clear heart, but an often misunderstood soul, mainly because its headliner, Jack Black, doesn't deliver the laughs you would expect. Orange County is not an energetic, high-octane romp, but a sweet and endearing character study that is equal parts sly comedy and equal parts dramatic and deep. A scene comes early on in the film where Shaun is wasting away in a class and his teacher is asking the students if they know anyone who would be interested in speaking to the school about personal experiences. Shaun proposes a writer who has just received a high honor, but is quickly one-upped by another classmate who has connections to Brittney Spears. This scene illustrates so discretely and subtly how motivated and turned on we get as a society by popularity and publicity rather than true talent and admiration.Colin Hanks, an actor still searching for that breakout role, handles the task here beautifully, even with the challenge and notable burden of carrying a lion's weight of a film on his back. He's no idiot. His character rarely misses a beat and is a calming and simple pleasure to endure. So is his brother, despite his slow, uninspiring persona. Orange County has an indescribable beauty and charm to its screenplay, one that offers an experience that is fresh and viable, and definitely unconventional.Starring Colin Hanks, Jack Black, Schuyler Fisk, Catherine O'Hara, John Lithgow, and Lily Tomlin.

A scene comes early on in the film where Shaun is wasting away in a class and his teacher is asking the students if they know anyone who would be interested in speaking to the school about personal experiences. Shaun proposes a writer who has just received a high honor, but is quickly one-upped by another classmate who has connections to Brittney Spears. This scene illustrates so discretely and subtly how motivated and turned on we get as a society by popularity and publicity rather than true talent and admiration.Colin Hanks, an actor still searching for that breakout role, handles the task here beautifully, even with the challenge and notable burden of carrying a lion's weight of a film on his back. He's no idiot. His character rarely misses a beat and is a calming and simple pleasure to endure. So is his brother, despite his slow, uninspiring persona. Orange County has an indescribable beauty and charm to its screenplay, one that offers an experience that is fresh and viable, and definitely unconventional.Starring Colin Hanks, Jack Black, Schuyler Fisk, Catherine O'Hara, John Lithgow, and Lily Tomlin. Directed by Jake Kasdan.

Savvy folks see through it.The problem is threefold with this movie.First, the initial idea. It's a drawing board failure. It's the idea that can be mildly humorous for five seconds when two friends come up with the idea. It doesn't translate well into performance, as we see here.Second, the writing just doesn't inspire. It tries to be too mundane, and induce laughter with the ordinary. Some writers can do this. We don't have such writers for this script.Third, you need some raw comic talent in performers. These look like acting school students, trying to be funny. They just don't have it.And yet, while it has no value as comedy, it appears there is a fan club. The obvious conclusion is that this hits the ordinary talentless person in their gut, and lets such a person be part of an ordinary world.So I attribute the success to being ordinary, something that the high school dropouts, painters, roofers, rich kids with cameras, and pot heads can relate to, something that tells them it is okay to be without talent.Obviously, this isn't a funny movie, but the heart is in the right place.

I'd say that was pretty good staying power.This one surprised me, like a lot of public domain films often do. Barbara Stanwyck heads the cast of what turns out to be a colorful group of dysfunctional characters. It's only when the picture's over and you begin to analyze some of the plot elements that the story turns out to be somewhat contrived, but it's pretty riveting during it's run time. The early scene when the young Martha Ivers (Janis Wilson) conks her aunt (Judith Anderson) on the head with a cane looked rather unrealistic. It looked like she held back for fear of actually hurting Miss Anderson and the bump looked like one a pro wrestler would throw.The other thing that bothered me was that whole business about convicting and executing an innocent man of the Aunt's murder. Why? If the original story of a huge intruder in the mansion in the dark of night was sufficient for the authorities, why manufacture this result? Unless it was for the express purpose of demonstrating what a couple of sordid louts Martha (Stanwyck) and her husband (Kirk Douglas) were. In that case it worked.Van Heflin was pretty good here. His characters often manage to rub me the wrong way, but he was solid here, often misdirecting the viewer with his true intentions once the plot begins to thicken. I've only seen Lizabeth Scott in one other film, portraying a similar character named Dusty Chandler opposite Bogart in Dead Reckoning. The Bogey connection leads me to think of her as a Bacall-like stand in who demonstrates a certain ambiguity in both films. Part of that comes from her appearance, it's tough to decide whether she's a looker or not. Most of the time I'd say she is.

Loosely based on the real-life FBI investigation into the murders of three civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964, Parker at the helm doesn't pull many punches in depicting the brutality and violence that was inflicted on the black community by the infamous Ku Klux Klan. Dafoe and Hackman have great chemistry together in the lead roles; Dafoe is Agent Alan Ward - a young and by-the-book agent from up North. He's heading the investigation into rural Jessep County along with Agent Anderson, a maverick, hard-ass and former Mississippi sheriff who understands how the people feel down here. Naturally, the pair clash throughout the film over their different ways of thinking and of how they think they should be going about the investigation. It isn't long until they realise just how bad things are down here. They get right to the heart of the KKK operating from within Jessep County, and when all else fails (After getting in a hundred new agents and even the Navy Reserve to help them search the swamps for the bodies) Ward decides to let Anderson have things his way, and they launch a brutal war against the Ku Klux Klan in order to get to the bottom of the injustices that have taken place here.Parker certainly doesn't hold back, and the excellent cinematography (Which the film won an Oscar for) drags us through the swamps, the desolate farms and right down into the chicken coops as the black people are terrorized and beaten by the white trash KKK. R. Lee Ermy (Full Metal Jacket) is brilliant as the mayor of the town who becomes enraged by the media attention that swarms onto their small town at the height of the FBI investigation (You know something Anderson, your getting so far up my nose I'm beginning to feel your boots on my chin). Brad Dourif (Child's Play) is the local wife-beating, KKK member deputy, and the brilliant and somewhat underrated Michael Rooker (Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer) is Frank, a local thug and KKK member who gets himself into a very close and painful encounter with Agent Anderson. The only problem I had with this film was that it felt like Parker had a very heavy hand in depicting the events. The film received a bit of criticism when it was released because of the way it portrayed the real-life investigation, but another reason was because of the way that the black community is portrayed as being a passive victim - which I felt too when watching it. They black people are not seen to stand up for themselves at all, and instead we have the white men from up country coming down to do their fighting for them. I'm well aware of how hard it was for the black community at this time, but I neglect to think that they never attempted to fight back - especially when you see the rampages of the KKK here. To say that Mississippi Burning adequately portrays real events would be correct, however, to say that it honestly and whole-heartedly portrays the FBI investigation in 1964 of the murders of the civil rights activists would be a far cry, and inevitably, an exaggeration.

There are no real laughs in this film. Maybe a couple quick half-hearted chuckles now and then. The idea explored in this film is original, sure. It's also absurd. Yes, I know it's just a movie and it's not supposed to be a realistic idea -- and that is fine with me, because absurd ideas can still be the basis for a great film.This was not a great film. I can be a pretty sick guy sometimes, and I've been known to sometimes laugh at terrible things but something about the way Malkovich's body is taken over while pushing his real personality to the side to be forever doomed to go insane watching himself be remote controlled all while helpless to stop it really makes me a bit disgusted. I think the reason why is because it's portrayed in kind of a positive light where we should laugh at the despair. If that wasn't the case I would have been fine with it.And then there are the pretty f--ked up sexual themes. I really just did not like this movie at all. There was real possibility for some deep examination of the idea and humanity in general, but instead it's exploited for some (attempts at) cheap humor. On top of all this, NONE of the characters are even remotely likable. I do not recommend this one to anybody. Not sure how it got anywhere near the top 250. Very disappointed.It managed only one genuine laugh from me in the whole thing. The part where everybody has the head of Malkovich when he goes inside himself.

There are no real laughs in this film. Maybe a couple quick half-hearted chuckles now and then. The idea explored in this film is original, sure. It's also absurd. Yes, I know it's just a movie and it's not supposed to be a realistic idea -- and that is fine with me, because absurd ideas can still be the basis for a great film.This was not a great film. I can be a pretty sick guy sometimes, and I've been known to sometimes laugh at terrible things but something about the way Malkovich's body is taken over while pushing his real personality to the side to be forever doomed to go insane watching himself be remote controlled all while helpless to stop it really makes me a bit disgusted. I think the reason why is because it's portrayed in kind of a positive light where we should laugh at the despair. If that wasn't the case I would have been fine with it.And then there are the pretty f--ked up sexual themes. I really just did not like this movie at all. There was real possibility for some deep examination of the idea and humanity in general, but instead it's exploited for some (attempts at) cheap humor. On top of all this, NONE of the characters are even remotely likable. I do not recommend this one to anybody. Not sure how it got anywhere near the top 250. Very disappointed.It managed only one genuine laugh from me in the whole thing. The part where everybody has the head of Malkovich when he goes inside himself. That was clever and disturbingly hilarious.

And what a wonderfully silly film it still is too! It's not the type of film I can watch too often, but once I reach a certain point I always find myself completely immersed in its dreamlike ambiguities. It was a superb creation from a master storyteller, Alfred Hitchcock knew his craft so perfectly after over 30 years in the business that it's hardly surprising that Vertigo still delights people today. Whether it's a better film than Citizen Kane though is perhaps a question to leave to the experts &#x85; to get wrong.Ex-police detective James Stewart is hired by old friend to follow and make sure his wife Kim Novak is alright as she doesn't appear to be alright in the head. Stewart falls in love with Novak, and later vice versa. And literally head over heels too! She apparently commits suicide with vertigo-struck Stewart unable to prevent her. But be warned what begins improbably continues implausibly and climaxes almost impossibly. I've seen it quite a few times since it was first on UK TV in the '80's (copyright problems held it and some other Hitchcock films off the box till then) but once seen and you know who's leading who up the garden path it can lose a bit of its power. It's slightly unsettling watching Stewart as a middle-aged stalker then as a perceived pervert, but Novak soon puts minds at rest in the pivotal scene when she's trying to write her confession. As with a few other films the music actually makes it much better &#x96; Bernard Herrmann's score is actually essential to the enjoyment of this; it's insistent and weaves in and out revolving around everything in here. Favourite bit the love scene of course, I just hope you hear it in stereo!Nice acting (Stewart's best performance outside of It's A Wonderful Life), memorable photogenic locations, lovely lilting music, grippingly mad story, tremendous production values and direction &#x96; who could ask for anything more? One of the best films ever made depending on the size of the list, mine would probably have at least 100 titles in it to be included.

","genre":"Mystery, Romance, Thriller"},{"date":"4 August 2012","score":"","review":" I DON'T CARE! Your fugitive's name is Dr. Richard Kimball. Go find him. These lines of Tommy Lee Jones practically set the tone for the chase for the vascular surgeon who was accused of killing his wife in Chicago in this superior Warner Brothers production. The storyline, especially for me and others in my generation who watched the TV series by the same name in the 60's, is very familiar Dr. Kimball is, to reiterate, falsely accused of killing his wife, though Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard very stubbornly refuses to believe it. An unfair judge at an unfair trial sentences Kimball to be killed, but on the way by bus to the place where the execution is to take place there is a wreck where, after an attempted killing on the bus, the bus gets swayed onto a railroad when a fast train plunges into the bus, (which is real in the movie), leaving Kimball to escape to run back to Chicago, and so he does. I was impressed with the acting. Tommy Lee Jones justly earned the Best Supporting Actor Award for 1993, and Harrison Ford aptly conveyed the fact that he was a bitter and upset man, knowing he was unjustly accused of murder and very angry that his wife was dead and he did not know who the real killer was. Sela Ward was very appealing as Kimball's wife Helen, and Jereon Krabbe portrayed well the two-faced, crooked physician. The setting was and was not drawing the Carolina woods made a beautiful part of nature, but some of the parts of Chicago were dismal at best. I was glued to the movie because of the story itself and the concomitant excitement. My late Mother, who was in her late 70's when she watched the DVD of it with me one night, like it as well, and she was very picky. Arnold Kopelson was a capable producer, and Andrew Davis was a skillful director, and I was especially impressed with the music of James Newton Howard.
