That should have been a quote from his casting interview.This is a horrible script with vapid dialogue and a bleeding heart so big that it is this film that needs a transplant; a brain transplant.   Films trying to make a political point (in this case an emotional appeal for National Health Care) are usually deft enough to bury the message in the subtext.  This one oversimplifies the issue, preaches unabashedly and even sends a parade of lefties to bang the drum and spew liberal pap all over the screen.  Films like this never seem to have trouble finding backers, but at least give us some semi-intelligent interchanges and believable scenes.Director Nick Cassavetes seems oblivious to the fact that the film is cartoonish, as he lets inane drivel attempt to pass as serious dialogue.  With the exception of John Q, most of the other characters are cardboard cutouts of you favorite stereotype action figures.  We have the cold heartless hospital administrator (Anne Heche), the arrogant doctor (James Wood), the good hearted but dopey factory worker (David Thornton), the grandstanding police chief (Ray Liotta) and the street wise career cop (Robert Duvall).The story is totally predictable, telegraphing the outcome in the first three minutes.  Cassavetes seems content with TV level production values and milks the screenplay for every ounce of sympathy it can muster.  This is the most shameless emotional manipulation that one could imagine. There is a considerable amount of talent that flounders attempting to prop this film up.  Denzel Washington gives a good performance with one of the few characters in the film that is close to believable.  He makes John a very noble and respectable character with a warm heart and an iron will.  Kimberly Elise is also credible as his wife, and Daniel E. Smith is lovable as his son.The rest of the cast should hide in shame.  James Wood is a terrific actor, but overplayed the pompous doctor routine to the point of being ridiculous.  Anne Heche, who always comes across as a bit cold, takes this character to the arctic, only to become a weepy basket case at the end in a stunning reversal.  Ray Liotta and Robert Duvall are more like a Keystone Kops than serious cops.  Shawn Hatosy brings new meaning to the word obnoxious as the rich kid who brings the hooker he just beat up to the ER (sure, that's realistic; it happens all the time).This film isn't terrible, but it's close.  I really enjoy watching Denzel work, but this script is a total hack job, and as good as he is he can't save it.  I rated it a 3\/10.

I can see why they would say that, because this main plot line is atrociously thought out, and utterly indefensible.You have the Earth being invaded by aliens whose intelligence gets them all the way through space to our planet, with ships capable of cloaking themselves. But then, that's where the genius stops, quite abruptly. You see, they have come to a planet that is 2\/3rds water (which is toxic to them) in order to harvest human beings, who are also mostly water (hence water present in their dwellings). Human beings also have a proliferation of weapons, and yet what do the aliens bring, besides their gangly bodies? Nothing. (BTW, I love how a humanoid body strong enough to jump up to the roof of a farmhouse can't kick down a pantry door!) Their natural weapon is a gas-emitting spike on their wrists. That's all they use! Not a very wise choice for conquering the Earth now is it? And what makes them think they could rely only on their poison gas to harm us, when our basic physical properties are so different? Finding out whether your only weapon works after traveling light years to the battlefield is not very wise.So where do these practically unarmed geniuses land, after their recon mission is complete? Among other places, the United States, the most effectively armed nation on Earth. Wouldn't it make more sense to go harvest the more defenseless humans in Africa, who have practically no infrastructure? Well it might, if the writer\/director had worried as much about the story as he did about getting Mel Gibson to cry for him.The aliens use mere radio waves to communicate (did the FCC give them authorization?) to each other, which somehow doesn't alert the military, who could at the very least have started jamming it. But hey military, shmilitary, this director is afraid of guns, so the defenders of our nation get no mention.Another archaic tactic the aliens use is marking targets with- tada! crop circles!

It's also hard to picture the sunken-chested, narrow-shouldered Joaquin Phoenix being a home-run champ.

Those movies have been coming out and just BEGGING to be spoofed since the early 60s, and Mike Meyers is the one who finally steps forward to do what simply has to be done, and he does a wonderful job at it.Fans of the James Bond films will have a blast looking for all of the allusions to the old Bond films and trying to determine which Bond film is being spoofed at any given time, but it's important to keep in mind that the film pokes fun at the Bond series in good taste. Austin Powers International Man of Mystery is never disrespectful to the films that it makes fun of, which is probably the single most important thing about a spoof film that makes it good. This is why the Scary Movies, as just a couple of examples, were such dismal, hideous failures. They try to be funny by viciously making fun of all kinds of movies, and end up looking stupid because they have such a nonexistent right to do that. You can't make a stupid, stupid movie and make fun of a lot of great movies (and some not so great, admittedly) and try to pretend to be respectable at the end of it all. That's the recipe for a crapfest.While it's true that a lot of the comedy in the first Austin Powers film is slapstick and obviously contrived, I think it should be a testament to the quality of the film that it is still so funny!

Meyers portrays both characters with hilarious skill, making Austin an awkward womanizer with some serious dental problems, and Dr. Evil an evil schemer with a hilarious cutesy side.

A comparison that I was originally confused by because it points to the fact that these two films are somewhat alike. As of now, that statement couldn't be more true. This is the third time in a row that I've been completely mesmerized by a Tarkovsky film. The first was `Stalker', the second `Nostalghia', and now the most ambitious of the three has taken me by complete surprise as a result of its complexity. It's also very hard to describe this piece of science fiction without giving too much away. It's a sci-fi romance\/mystery\/philosophical journey all rolled into one. It's a romance, yet, it isn't really a romance at all; more of an `artificial' romance. If that doesn't sound strange enough, watch the film. Both Solaris and 2001 a space odyssey share one thing aside from their science fiction roots; they explore mankind in a psychological way.2001 expresses its point visually, taking us on a trip without explaining much. Solaris, at times is very talky, which takes it into a much different direction than the aforementioned film. It leaves much more to the imagination than you might expect. Yes, there are shots of the planet itself, but the conflicts and mystery play out mostly in your head. I like how Tarkovsky is able to make you believe something is happening, when it isn't physically happening. This is a big plus, and makes it all the more remarkable, because you can tell this was done on a small budget, but makes the best of it. Like 2001, it sets up a mystery, past its lengthy exposition, regarding the planet Solaris. The mystery is setup but never solved, and we are still wondering, `what is it?' But that is not the only mystery that drives the film; the other involves the main character, Chris Kelvin, and how he struggles to understand himself, and his love for the woman he lost many years before. And who has been resurrected by some power or ability the planet posesses. There is a great irony in this. Kelvin, a psychologist, is sent to the planet Solaris to do a report on the scientists who are working on a station to see whether the project should be terminated or not. Yet, he himself is the one eventually subjected to being studied.The scientists are sent to study the planet, but the reason that they haven't, and cannot find a logical explanation to the problem laid down in front of them is that they do not understand themselves. It even occurs at one point in the film where the wisest among the scientists, Snauth, doesn't have all the answers, and he's right. Even in the end, they are still in a state of confusion, but we somehow understand that state of confusion. I don't think Stainslaw Lem, or even Tarkovsky for that matter, set out to answer questions the about humanity, but merely brought the questions and ideas forth to present them in a way that we might understand that not everything can be explained. We are limited as human beings. The final shot demonstrates that, as it pulls slowly away to reveal an image that I will never forget.Tarkovsky brings the film both hauntingly and beautifully together. Not only does he do that, but his camerawork is slow and contemplative. It baffles me how someone like him can be that patient. He was one of a kind; a visual poet, a master at bringing art to the screen, yet his filmography only spans 7 films. I read that he considered this to be the weakest of all his films, but that isn't saying much. It draws you in by your curiosity, and never releases its grip til the end.

The trailer with this scene in it put me off altogether, and it was only because a workmate raved over 'Last Orders' that I decided to see the film. In fact it is a cleverly made celebration of the lives of ordinary people with about as profound an emotion as the Cinema can evoke in its viewers.Jack (Michael Caine), Ray (Bob Hoskins), Vic (Tom Courtney) and Lenny (David Hemmings) are the old farts, and Helen Mirren is Michael's wife Amy. At the opening of the movie, Jack, a founder member of the Jolly Butcher school has just succumbed to heart disease, and the survivors have undertaken to carry out his last wish to have his ashes cast into the sea at Margate, a windswept seaside resort about 60 miles away. Jack's son Vince (Ray Winstone) who is in the motor trade has laid on a large Mercedes for the occasion, and they all set off, except for Amy who has other family business to attend to.What we then get is the story of the group via a cleverly arranged series of flashbacks, commencing just prior to the Second World War. The tale is an ordinary one but one with which millions of older Brits would empathise with. There are several different strands in the narrative and as younger actors are used in some of the flashback scenes it becomes difficult to recognise characters at first (though in David Hemmings' case things were made easier by casting his son Nolan). JJ Fields is a standout as the young Jack. Some characters (eg Vince) are portrayed by up to four different actors. A second viewing is called for, I think. It helps if you are familiar with British cars; each period seems to be adorned with the appropriate vehicles, including a sixties 'Dormobile' (camper van) which becomes a leit-motiv for the whole story, but I think Fred Schepisi should have stuck the date\/place up at the beginning of the flashbacks to help those who are not car buffs.Michael Caine is an amazing actor. He is always the same yet here he fits the character of Jack the butcher perfectly. Caine just gets better with age. Bob Hoskins as Ray the punter and Helen Mirren as Amy are also terrific. Tom Courtenay as Vic the undertaker has a lesser role but is also convincing. David Hemmings as Lenny has not much to work with &#150; he really only has one scene when he tries to punch out Vince in a boggy field - yet he produces a definitive picture of a boozy old man in decline.

She does this but a few seconds later we see another shot of her struggling in the water and the strap is still there. Hmm....i think it is safe to say that this film  was rushed and when the makers realized the mistake it was too late to change it. All in all i felt this was a pleasant film and I give it a 7 out of 10 ","genre":"Drama, Romance, Sport"},{"date":"19 August 2002","score":"","review":"  My first thoughts after this movie is that finally this director has mad a good movie. For I have been quite disappointed at his previous overrated efforts. Thos of course were the very boring, one-punch movies, unbreakable and 6th sense, I disliked them so much that I don't think the deserved to be capitalized. However Signs on the other hand is a gem amongst a pile of dirt. Signs is a very effective tale of suspense, thrills and frights. First of all it relates to the viewers in that the characters and locations are very typical, small town folks that are easy to understand and relate to. Secondly it plays upon a common theme of someone watching you, someone of course that you don't see. Finally when you do see them you realized that you were better off before. It has a realistic portrayal of the reactions of mankind to an invasion of enormous magnitudes. There aren't laser beams everywhere with little space ships buzzing all over the place. The thing I like about it the most was that there wasn't any disgusting showings of over-patriotism that are common in such films as Independance Day, The Patriot etc. Such patriotism can induce vommiting. There aren't any over-the-top Power Ranger type action sequences. It does however just falls short of greatness. It does have a ending such as the other 2 films however the its not stupid like in unbreakable, and its not as predictable as 6th sense. Furthermore its not like oh, so its that way? Well..who cares? the ending does have significance unlike 6th sense where is just seems like the ending was not like so what? who cares if he's a ghost.  9\/10 well done. Chalk up another one for Gibson. ","genre":null},{"date":"19 August 2002","score":"","review":"  My first thoughts after this movie is that finally this director has mad a good movie.

The results are far from from perfect but nevertheless interesting, and the very character-focused plot makes way for some fascinating possibilities for the inevitable sequel.The story is simple and gets down to action almost instantly bookish, bullied schoolboy Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) is bitten by a radioactive spider whilst on a school visit to a science laboratory.  After a while he develops some unusual abilities such super-strength and the power to shoot web-strings from his wrists that can allow him to swing between tall buildings.  Thus, Spider-Man is born.Meanwhile, misguided scientist Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe) is working on a serum that will give him super-strength.  Working against the wishes of the military, for whom he created the serum in the first place, he tries the stuff out on himself.  He becomes demented power mad villain the Green Goblin and provides a fittingly insane opponent for Spider-Man.The script and story-line are actually very good and set up relationships that can be developed over the course of several films.  A curious love triangle is created between Parker, his best friend Harry Osborne(James Franco), Norman Osborne's son, and the love of both their lives Mary-Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  It is this that will very likely be the basis for the follow-up.This triangle is very well acted by the younger players in the film.  Maguire makes for a tragic Spider-Man who, even as he accumulates and uses his superpowers, never quite loses his nebbish streak and is unable to tell Mary-Jane how much he really loves her.  Dunst is as beautiful as ever and creates a complex, well-rounded Mary-Jane.  Franco has little to do in this movie but gets a good last scene at the end of the film that smacks of promise for what is to follow.The film gets a chilling villain in Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin.  From the moment of his transformation, Dafoe captures the nuances and ticks of an increasingly desperate and imbalanced man.  This is notable in scenes where Dafoe literally talks to himself in a mirror.  This loses its edge only when he is in full super-villain get-up.  His lively and scary features obscured by a goofy, unconvincing mask, it takes away some of the relish inherent in his performance.With the exception of Dafoe, none of the older players are anywhere near as good as their younger counterparts and this detracts from some of the comic as well as dramatic moments in the plot.  J.Jonah Jameson is simply not funny enough as fast-talking news editor J.K Simmons.  After being attacked by the Green Goblin, Rosemary Harris descends into pitiably unconvincing screaming as May Parker while Cliff Robertson, as her husband, fudges the delivery of the film's most important line With great power comes great responsibility.  The three of them are no doubt very experienced and accomplished actors but it is just a shame their performances were less than adequate here.Action scenes are well choreographed, with enough punch-ups, explosions and people-in-peril to create plenty of thrills and tension.  The CGi used occasionally looks a little bit too cartoony but this doesn't detract as its a comic-book film anyway.As with the best films of its kind, this is accompanied by an excellent theme tune.  Chad Kroeger and Josey Scott's eclectic rock song Hero perfectly complements the drama and cynicism in the film's plot.Not too bad a first outing for Spider-Man but, a la Superman, one suspects the sequel will be a huge improvement.

With the Rolls Royce of directors\/writers Barry Levinson, (Natural, Rain Man & Good Morning Vietnam, to name but a few!!) and an absolutely fabulous cast, (if a director ever wants a young cast with a cop esthetically emerging potential like this one ever again, he will have to get it from the guy with the red horns!!!) this film is one of the finest!!!! Top 20 in my book and top 30 for comedies according to the critics of AFI!!!!

So it's not a very original story but it is refreshing in its hilarity and a good soppy romance is always worth watching especially when it features the awfully handsome and awfully British Colin Firth.For anyone who doesn't know, 'Bridget Jones' is a modern take on Jane Austen's classic 'Pride And Prejudice' and like its predecessor, it has become a classic in its own right.Renee Zellwegger is perfect as Bridget, the single thirty-something who finds it hard to find a good man and even harder to give up the booze and drop those extra pounds. Her English accent is also spot on.Hugh Grant as bad boy Daniel Cleaver is absolutely fantastic. Grant has managed to recreate himself with astonishing success with this charming, witty and very sexy character. Who would have thought Hugh Grant could play sexy but he does it here so well.Because this is a remake of 'Pride And Prejudice' I couldn't have imagined anyone other than Colin Firth as Mark Darcy. He played the role of Darcy in The BBC's adaptation of Jane Austen's masterpiece so well that it would be hard to accept anyone else in this role.Colin Firth is Mark Darcy, there's no doubt about that. He makes it look so easy, it's as if he's not acting at all. He's also extremely sexy without even trying to be. It's also great that he doesn't mind poking fun at his earlier work. After playing Darcy in 'Pride And Prejudice' he might have turned down this role but he didn't, thank Heaven!To all the hopeless romantics out there, mostly women I know, you haven't seen  romance until you see this film. Definitely worth watching for the hilarity but more importantly for the incredibly gorgeous Colin, not to mention the best kiss I've ever seen!

Not that the movie is bad, but it was way too overloaded when I think about it... The theme has been in hundreds of movies before and this one isn't the best. But it was nice, the actors gave good performances and if you are able to sit back and don't think about the originality of the story you'll like it. Especially if you like Mandy Moore ;) (which acted much better than I expected). Since I don't want to spoil anything I will just say that esp. the end of the movie was the part that was the most overloaded. Too many plot-lines solved at once... You can all see it coming from the beginning or the moment the matter is first mentioned in the movie. Overall not a masterpiece of film but solid as I said...

And when the original is the 1931 classic FRANKENSTEIN, it's an even greater accomplishment, but that's exactly what director James Whale did.  He created a film that is not only considered one of the best horror films of all time, but also one of the best pictures, of any genre, in Hollywood's history.After a brief prologue, THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN begins right where its predecessor left off.  The Monster (Karloff) has survived the burning windmill and is once again in search of acceptance.  He eventually meets up with the wonderfully evil Dr. Pretorius (Thesiger) who decides to make a female monster, a mate for Dr. Frankenstein's creation.  Of course Frankenstein (Clive) refuses to be involved but is then forced to assist Pretorius when the villain has the Monster kidnap his wife (Hobson).THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN is a joy to watch.  Whale obviously relished the freedom he was given after his successes with FRANKENSTEIN and THE INVISIBLE MAN, and the cast seems to be enjoying themselves, as well.  Whale did not, however, have a blank check.  This is evidenced by the large amount of cuts the censors required him to make, mostly for being too blatantly, (homo)sexually symbolic.  Despite this, the film retains a great deal of symbolism that makes for a more interesting viewing experience than one gets from the average horror film.Boris Karloff argued against the Monster gaining the power of speech in this film.  Many have said in retrospect that he was wrong.  I disagree...partially.  Karloff is right in that this would have been disastrous in the hands of any other actor.  Karloff's gift for generating sympathy with the audience enabled him to pull it off flawlessly.Ernest Thesiger is a delight as the evil (and slightly prissy) Dr. Pretorius.  Again, this role could easily have been an overacted nightmare, but in Thesiger's care the character shines with tasteful camp rather than flamboyant buffoonery.  Colin Clive returns as Dr. Frankenstein and the very beautiful Valerie Hobson replaces Mae Clark in the role of Elizabeth Frankenstein.  Elsa Lanchester has a dual part, appearing first as Mary Shelley in the prologue, and later as the Bride.  She does a great job as the female monster, bringing the mute character to surprising life, given the short amount of screen time she had.  Many viewers will remember that Dwight Frye, the all too underrated character actor,  played Frankenstein's assistant Fritz in the original film.  He is back in a similar role here, this time called Karl (Fritz was killed in the original).Once again, the makeup is amazing.  Jack Pierce refined the Monster's features a bit and created another truly wonderful makeup for the Bride.  She is both grotesque and oddly attractive...another of the dualistic symbols which permeate this landmark film.
