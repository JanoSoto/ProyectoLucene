[{"date":"18 September 1998","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Matt Damon stars in this likable story about poker. The story is engaging and refreshingly -- the film does not talk down to the viewer. There are many poker terms bandied about and time is not taken to explain each and every one -- something that you don't see often in the movies. The film is well-written and you are carried along with the action. Damon does an excellent job with a difficult part -- how do you act the part of someone whose best asset is that he doesn't react? Damon nails it. The supporting cast is tight -- standouts are Edward Norton, John Malkovich and John Turturro. The female characters are more weakly drawn and tend to be a bit one-dimensional, but the parts are handled ably by Gretchen Mol as the girlfriend and Famke Janssen as a rounder. Janssen does an especially nice job -- it would have been nice to see more of her character. Overall, I highly recommend this movie. It isn't the deepest movie to come out of Hollywood, but it is solid entertainment and it might stimulate a few conversations after viewing. But be careful -- everyone I saw this film with immediately wanted to start playing poker...
