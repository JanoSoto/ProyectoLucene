[{"date":"30 December 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Technically, there are some interesting things for this layman to note. The film is a well-edited, free flowing assembly of wide shots from height, interesting dollied shots, often in Hitler's car (which show how much access Riefenstahl had been granted) and head-height shots of fanatic crowds or parading soldiers. This is where Riefenstahl's gifts are most evident. The crowd shots - almost always shot at an angle so that the hordes taper away to an off-screen vanishing point - are augmented with a selection of well-chosen, portrait-like head shots of individuals, sometimes staged. There are also a number of detail close- ups, not only the beating of drums but also standing on tip-toe or the clutching of flowers.Thus the film works its magic spell through documenting the extraordinary public showing in Nürnberg but spinning it with bucolic and humanised inserts of the German Volk (witness the jolly, almost homoerotic sequence early on with the men preparing for the Reichsparteitag) and, of course, the ubiquitous, manicured juxtapositions of Hitler himself. I was also fascinated by the use of music, sometimes vaguely diegetic, but now and again clearly written for the film. Particularly noteworthy is the early re-working of Act 1 of Tristan und Isode (Heil, König Marke, Heil!) for Hitler's disembarkation from the plane to a chorus of Heils.As far as the content goes, I (inevitably?) found it rather dispiriting that the centre of Nürnberg should look so lovely (both Riefenstahl and the Nazis got lucky with terrific sunlight) and the Speer-created party arena so soulless. It's also very interesting to hear Goebbels talking so openly about the importance of propaganda on the same platform as Otto Dietrich demanding foreign journalists report the truth about the Reich. It's that brazen.
