I looked forward to finally watching The Faculty as this story seemed intriguing and those angst ridden kids seemed saucy enough to carry this film.  The Faculty is the story of a group of high school kids in rural Ohio who find out that their teachers are not just mean, they are nasty aliens hell bent on taking over the world.  We are introduced to six different kids, all from different parts of the clique chain, who accidently come together when they witness their teachers doing some horrific things. Bebe Neuwirth is killed in a horrifying opening by a nasty gym teacher and a timid (or so we think) Piper Laurie.  And from there the film takes off into an Invasion of the Body Snatchers direction, with kids who are forced to work together despite their natural dislike for each other. Now I like my horror movies to be bad, and I like it better when the film is able to admit its own shortcomings.  The brilliance of recent films like Scream was in the fact that they didn't take themselves too seriously.  The Faculty doesn't take itself too seriously, and it clearly pays homage to several great horror flicks of days past.  One would get the feeling that the producers of this film enjoyed the fact that they were ripping off some of their favorite films.  The only trouble is, that in all of their enjoyment, they forgot about the audience. The Faculty delivers on many levels.  The effects are interesting.  The kids are cute and some of the dialogue (but certainly not all of it) is OK.  I enjoyed films like Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Carrie, so this was, to some extent, a welcome treat.  On the other hand, the flaws in this effort are so big that they are hard to overlook.  These kids find out awfully fast what the aliens are made of.  These kids should be doing AIDS research, not fighting squishy monsters. As well, the film stopped being scary early on in the story.  In Invasion of the Body Snatchers (any version) I was horrified by the mere idea of some pod critter taking over my body.  Watching this film, I thought, 'What the hell?  When they call me to the nurse's office for my ear exam, I'm going.'And then there was that whole vampire logic, which I will not get into because it would be a spoiler, but suffice it to say, was a easy way out of this 'already crumby' plot.

After I finished the film I was both shocked and confused as to what had happened. It seemed to me everything Verbal had said to Dave Kujan was false, or some of it false, and the only confirmed truthful events or persons we actually see during the course of the film is the setup (or lineup), Verbal's testimony to the DEA, the death of the suspects except Verbal, Verbal's lies to Kujan, Kobayashi's existence, and of course the fact Keyser Soze is Verbal Kint (or could Kobayashi be Soze?)... This all took hours to figure out, but then I thought, the movie is rubbish..it just cheats at the end.Months later The Usual Suspects was screened on TV. I gathered the will to watch it again, and I watched it with the knowledge of what happens at the end. I learned SO much more. So many little details (like the history of Keyser Soze and Dean Keaton, and their questionable past relationship or rivalry). Also, I appreciated the movie for what it is before the twist at the end a clever, mysterious noir with great music, editing, script, characters and acting. But I still didn't fully understand the ending and its link to the flashbacks. If everything which Verbal said was shown in the flashbacks, why did Verbal admit to killing the man with the case who Keaton couldn't kill? Wouldn't that make Verbal a confessed murderer (he got set free after his testimony)? This is probably the only mysterious flaw(?) of the film.After the second viewing, I watch the film every two or three months when I have the time. EACH time I learn something refreshingly new. This must be one of the most carefully constructed films of alltime. When you think about it the film was giving you as many clues as to who Keyser Soze really is as as many tricks to making you think Keaton is Soze 1) the order of the gifts to the five guys from Kobayashi, and the way the camera never shows what was in Verbal's package 2) the tone of voice and the evil look Verbal gives in the lineup scene 3) the misleading, obviously tricky way the film always depicts Verbal as the last guy who could be Soze (the weasel\/cripple character, the constant jokes (gimp, pretzel man) made towards Verbal. 4) Verbal's crippled hand\/leg sometimes changes from left to right throughout the film. 5) Soz in Turkish means word.

There is nothing to spoil love, trust, confidence or even the events... Jenny seems to die... She just escapes in loveliness...Jenny (Ali MacGraw) is half of a pretty young married students from a working class background... And Oliver (Ryan O'Neal) is from a very wealthy family... Both have the predictable problems with disapproving parents... Both struggle along through hard times, until Oliver obtains a fine job with his own merit... When Jenny tries to get pregnant, the doctor finds out that she has an incurable disease, and has a very short time to live...Ryan O'Neal plays well the intense sensitive rebel, giving a heart-breaking performance as the ultra-rich man's son who works to pay his way through law school when his father won't...Ali MacGraw is good and touching in her portrait of Jenny, the dying heroine, the poor baker's daughter studying classical music at Radcliffe, the smart young girl who gives up her plans to study in Europe in order to marry Oliver... She never missed a 'shred of her beauty' in her role...Ray Milland is the 60-year-old Oliver Barrett III... He is a strong, articulate, civilized millionaire from Boston who refuses to support his son in marrying a girl of such low social stature... He commands him instead to finish law school...John Harley is Phil, the father of Jenny... For him, Father's love is something to cherish and respect.There is three sequences that I liked the most in the film- Jenny and Oliver wonderful kissing scene... From this point on, both were entirely engrossed with each other, ready to risk anything for love...- Oliver's long day search looking for Jenny, until he sees her sitting, outside, on a stair... She forgot her keys... Jenny is comforted by Oliver who tries to apologize for his continual disputes... Jenny, all shaken, and with tears in her eyes and with an emotional voice stops him with words of deep affection Love means never having to say you're sorry.- Oliver, sitting alone and lost to the world, uncertain and perplexed, unable to understand Jenny's tragic fate... If Jenny could spend an hour in his mind, a minute in his heart, a second in his soul to discover what he really feels loving her... Why Jenny has to die so young? Why destiny is against us sometimes, smashing all our hopes and happiness? Why we feel so impotent in front of the will of God? Why can't we understand that we are 'blessed with Life,' and this is our great gift, our true treasure! Barrett's millions could never save Jenny!The Lebanese poet Khalil Gibran said once Love knows not its own depth, until the hour of separation. And let me say that 'nothing is more beautiful than the love that has weathered the storms of Life.' They say Time mends a broken heart and true love never ends... But if true love never ended then time wouldn't have to mend... So Love Story was followed by Oliver's Story.Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw are splendid and beautifully matched... Arthur Hill's sincere direction commend the picture to a wide audience eager to a flood of tears... Love Story won 7 Academy Award nominations and Frances Lai - touching music - mixed by Bach, Mozart and Handel, won an Oscar, enriching the beauty of the film...An intense, tough-looking leading actor is seen Tommy Lee Jones in his film debut...

For him, Father's love is something to cherish and respect.There is three sequences that I liked the most in the film- Jenny and Oliver wonderful kissing scene... From this point on, both were entirely engrossed with each other, ready to risk anything for love...- Oliver's long day search looking for Jenny, until he sees her sitting, outside, on a stair... She forgot her keys... Jenny is comforted by Oliver who tries to apologize for his continual disputes... Jenny, all shaken, and with tears in her eyes and with an emotional voice stops him with words of deep affection Love means never having to say you're sorry.- Oliver, sitting alone and lost to the world, uncertain and perplexed, unable to understand Jenny's tragic fate... If Jenny could spend an hour in his mind, a minute in his heart, a second in his soul to discover what he really feels loving her... Why Jenny has to die so young? Why destiny is against us sometimes, smashing all our hopes and happiness? Why we feel so impotent in front of the will of God? Why can't we understand that we are 'blessed with Life,' and this is our great gift, our true treasure! Barrett's millions could never save Jenny!The Lebanese poet Khalil Gibran said once Love knows not its own depth, until the hour of separation. And let me say that 'nothing is more beautiful than the love that has weathered the storms of Life.' They say Time mends a broken heart and true love never ends... But if true love never ended then time wouldn't have to mend... So Love Story was followed by Oliver's Story.Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw are splendid and beautifully matched... Arthur Hill's sincere direction commend the picture to a wide audience eager to a flood of tears... Love Story won 7 Academy Award nominations and Frances Lai - touching music - mixed by Bach, Mozart and Handel, won an Oscar, enriching the beauty of the film...An intense, tough-looking leading actor is seen Tommy Lee Jones in his film debut...

It does not do so. About half way into the production, the story turns from dramatic thriller to dishonest courtroom drama. I enjoyed the earlier segments more than the later and felt somewhat cheated out of a great movie's promising second half.The film details the lives of four friends growing up in Hell's Kitchen as well as the mistakes they make. The young teens, Shakes (Joe Perrino), Michael (Brad Renfro), Tommy (Jonathan Tucker), and John (Geoff Wigdor), are carefree growing in the close-knit, although crime ridden, community. The boy's closest guardians are Father Bobby (Robert De Niro), a caring priest, and the urban crime lord King Benny (Vittorio Gassman). Shakes, John, Michael and Tommy spend most of their days playing tricks on local pedestrians.One day, after the four teens attempt to steal a hot dog from a cart, they endeavor an escape plan after the salesman does not give in to their scheme. The plan is to place the hot dog cart over a public staircase and balance it so the salesman must retrieve instead of chasing them. However, the kids lose control of the cart and it tumbles down the staircase crushing a man at the bottom. They are charged with reckless endangerment and sent to one year at the Wilkinson Home for boys.Sleepers contains a perfect setup, one that develops the time period, characters, setting, and intentions in a clear and effective manor. The film also carries a strong, focused narrative point of view through the Shakes character; we witness all the key events through his eyes. Each featured scene propels the story forward. If the continuing movie sustained the momentum built in the first act it would have been superior.At the Wilkinson Home for boys, Tommy, John, Shakes, and Michael must endure sadism and cruelty through torturous and pedophilic guards, who subject the kids to beatings and homosexual raping. Sean Nokes (Kevin Bacon), is the most notorious and serves as a plot point later that propels us in a completely new series of events.The movie skips twenty years into the lives of the teens. Characters and situations drift in and out of focus depending where Shakes stands in his life. The teens are grownup, and their personalities have greatly changed. John (Ron Eldard), and Tommy (Billy Crudup), are two murderous thugs who come upon Nokes one day, and I will not reveal what happens. Michael (Brad Pitt), is a local prosecutor who faces the weak attorney Danny Snyder (Dustin Hoffman)in a court case. Shakes (Jason Patric) is a reporter who continues to share an interest in one of his childhood friends, Carol Martinez (Minnie Driver), who was abandoned when Wilkinson came into the picture.The film's scenes are descriptive, but not exploiting. Take a rape scene for instance. In Wilkinson, Nokes sexually assaults the four boys. During the scene, however, we witness no mechanical sex, but the creation of horrific memories and truthful hate. Such sequences assemble a challenging motion picture, containing brutal moods but careful writing structure. Scenes build momentum through  sharp, smart and engaging dialogue. Such screen writing draws the audience in, structuring narrative drive for upcoming occurrences.The cast and filmmaking crew consist of so many well known and enormously talented individuals, screening the production is almost intimidating. Such individuals are Jason Patric, Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Brad Pitt, Kevin Bacon, Minnie Driver and Barry Levinson. The performances are absolutely riveting, taut, and powerful. Each cast member contributes a tantalizing, dramatic performance defining the outward appeal of Sleepers.Also first rate is the style, constructed in a mesmerizing fashion. This atmosphere brought to life here kept me intrigued until the very last scene. The soundtrack defines the film's culture in itself. Inspirational tones and favorably known numbers successfully help develop the mood to Sleepers.Writer and directed Barry Levinson takes a long time to develop a firm objective for the characters to meet. When there is finally a motive behind the great filmmaking, the achievements are understandable but are not necessarily empathetic. Of course, a movie such as Sleepers can not travel through a controversial subject without resisting the temptation to take a hit at organized religion.

This person isn't perfect--they too have their weaknesses, their flaws, but whenever you try to throw these flaws in their face, they come up with something even more incriminating about you to throw back.  You hate this person and love them dearly at the same time, because without them, you'd probably be in a gutter somewhere. That person you are thinking of is your 'Erin Brockovich.'  If you see the highly entertaining new Steven Soderbergh film named for her, you'll see my point.Hollywood does love the underdog.  When we're introduced to our heroine, played to perfection by Julia Roberts, she has no money, no job, and no marketable skills with which to get one.  Here we see the frustration anyone encounters when looking for a job `If only they would just give me a chance, I'd show them...'  Personality goes a long way, but isn't enough to land a job, even an entry-level one.  Personality's something Erin's got a bit too much of, unfortunately.  Her life so far has been one long disappointment and frustration and desperation has its way of creeping to the surface.One of the amazing things about Erin is that even when she's hanging onto the thinnest of threads, she never backs down.  For instance, she finally lands a job from her lawyer, Ed Masry (played by the brilliantly-cast Albert Finney), who takes pity on her because he lost her neck injury lawsuit.  Her wardrobe is limited to bright-colored, revealing tops and short skirts.  Ed starts to give her the standard `workplace attire' speech after she's been there a while.  She plainly refuses to change her wardrobe, citing `I think I look good' in her defense.  The way she says it leaves no room for argument, no room to question.  Suddenly, her wardrobe makes all the sense in the world!  Then comes the PG&E lawsuit.  After Erin reveals her findings to one family who have all become sick in one form or another, many other families begin to come forward.  Masry now has a very large civil case on his hands, and continually denies he has the resources to handle it.  Erin, of course, believes otherwise.  The case will require a ton of research, thousands of signatures, costly expert witnesses.  All Ed sees is money piling up that may never be repaid.  Erin sees people who have been wronged and lied to.  She makes her argument and, again, it makes all the sense in the world.  Erin Brockovich is about the power of giving a damn.

This person isn't perfect--they too have their weaknesses, their flaws, but whenever you try to throw these flaws in their face, they come up with something even more incriminating about you to throw back.  You hate this person and love them dearly at the same time, because without them, you'd probably be in a gutter somewhere. That person you are thinking of is your 'Erin Brockovich.'  If you see the highly entertaining new Steven Soderbergh film named for her, you'll see my point.Hollywood does love the underdog.  When we're introduced to our heroine, played to perfection by Julia Roberts, she has no money, no job, and no marketable skills with which to get one.  Here we see the frustration anyone encounters when looking for a job `If only they would just give me a chance, I'd show them...'  Personality goes a long way, but isn't enough to land a job, even an entry-level one.  Personality's something Erin's got a bit too much of, unfortunately.  Her life so far has been one long disappointment and frustration and desperation has its way of creeping to the surface.One of the amazing things about Erin is that even when she's hanging onto the thinnest of threads, she never backs down.  For instance, she finally lands a job from her lawyer, Ed Masry (played by the brilliantly-cast Albert Finney), who takes pity on her because he lost her neck injury lawsuit.  Her wardrobe is limited to bright-colored, revealing tops and short skirts.  Ed starts to give her the standard `workplace attire' speech after she's been there a while.  She plainly refuses to change her wardrobe, citing `I think I look good' in her defense.  The way she says it leaves no room for argument, no room to question.  Suddenly, her wardrobe makes all the sense in the world!  Then comes the PG&E lawsuit.  After Erin reveals her findings to one family who have all become sick in one form or another, many other families begin to come forward.  Masry now has a very large civil case on his hands, and continually denies he has the resources to handle it.  Erin, of course, believes otherwise.  The case will require a ton of research, thousands of signatures, costly expert witnesses.  All Ed sees is money piling up that may never be repaid.  Erin sees people who have been wronged and lied to.  She makes her argument and, again, it makes all the sense in the world.  Erin Brockovich is about the power of giving a damn.

I remember wanting to see this flick when it came out, but I never got around to it. I honestly don't know what all the criticism is about. I liked the movie a lot.Why? Well, here's a short list.1. Denzel Washington was his usual excellent self, playing the quadriplegic New York forensic investigator. His quiet kind of determination and humor, considering his condition, was really part of the heart and soul of this movie.2. I'm a sucker for most movies that have Angelina Jolie in them. Her character swung between tough as nails and vulnerable, and she made it look very believable. My only beef is her job on the story. More on this later.3. The villain is a brutal, sadistic, macabre, and utterly ruthless bad guy, who is excellent, lacking in only one quality - surprise. More on this later as well.4. Excellent shots of the New York City landscape.The movie has two major downsides, but in my case they were easy to overlook.1. The NYPD has a LOT of Forensic investigators on it's staff. There was never any excuse for sending an untrained patrol officer (like Angelina Jolie) as the first one into every crime scene. Lincoln Rhyme can't do it? Fine. Send one of the other dozen or so forensic teams. Talented or not, possessing great instincts or not, Amelia needed a lot more training before she could be trusted to be the first one on a crime scene, with or without Lincoln's endorsement.2. SPOILER ALERT.  The producers and directors apparently wanted to keep the killer's identity a secret, showing no hint of either his inspiration or motivation behind the crimes (much less the killer's identity) until it's close to the end. That was while they were filming. Then, to promote the movie, they do what? GIVE THE KILLER AN IMPORTANT LINE IN THE TRAILER!! Think back to a sentence that went something like this I gave you so many clues and you still failed!  C'mon, folks! I couldn't be the only one in the whole country who recognized that voice as Lieutenant DeWindt the glider pilot in Saving Private Ryan, or that poor guy from the massage parlor in Se7en. All I had to do was look for Leland Orser (yes, that actor has a name) and bingo! The killer's ID was no longer a surprise.2. Even if I haven't seen those movies, The Bone Collector goes out of it's way to give it away. All of the victim's have surgical cuts in their bodies.. Hmmmmm. How many characters that we know about have a medical background? In this movie the killer was supposed to be a surprise. But it wasn't.Also, a mini-beef. I guess there was some sort of semi-romantic subplot with Amelia and Lincoln, but the scriptwriters thought it would be best to wait until the flick's almost over to introduce it. Why? I dunno. Didn't like that part. I mean, c'mon. If they're gonna pair off, pair off! If not, don't try to make the story more interesting with half-baked love plots.I call it 8\/10 for the Bone Collector, an excellent suspense thriller in the tradition of Se7en and Copycat that drops the ball in some very easy places.

At that time I was utterly supportive of capital punishment -- to quote the script, I felt anyone who committed crimes horrible enough to land them on Death Row was an expendable human being, suckin' up tax dollars.  I also had personal experience with the issue when an entire family whom I knew in my childhood were slaughtered by a man who is now on Death Row for his crimes.As you might imagine, I was disgusted with Sr. Helen's book.  I thought that trotting to death row and holding the hand of some scumbag who'd killed innocent people was about the lowest thing anyone could do, and as a Catholic I was offended by the seeming hypocrisy of it.Because I had disliked the book, I never saw the film until about two weeks ago, when I bought a remaindered copy of it in a video store.  I have watched it four times since then, mostly because I am trying to work out my feelings on it.  I am still a supporter of capital punishment, but it's going to be less easy for me to ignore the fact that (to quote again), There's nobody with money on Death Row -- and quite a few more blacks, now that I think of it, AND the fact that, like Matthew Poncelet's character, the men who are being executed are human beings who have feelings and fears.  It's easy to jeer at Matthew on the day before his execution, fretting nervously about whether the lethal injection will hurt, like a little boy at the doctor's office for a penicillin shot, since his victims' last moments certainly hurt. What isn't easy is to realize that while the victims of these inmates didn't know they were about to die until it was too late, the inmates themselves have what seems like a blessing at first, but upon deeper examination is the greatest curse  knowing the exact hour and day they will die, and having to face it day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute.I'm sorry if this review offends people who are sincere death penalty supporters.  I still consider myself to be one, but my thinking has been reformed somewhat and I'm more ready to listen to the opponents and try to make compromises; maybe that's what this issue needs more than anything.  I will say finally that ONE part of this film did offend me as a Catholic the symbolic crucifixion of Poncelet during the last words scene.  That was the one place where Robbins strayed from his even-handed approach to the issue -- the only one I could find.In all, this was a fine film that made me rethink an explosive issue, and I recommend it highly to anyone debating the pros and cons.

What isn't easy is to realize that while the victims of these inmates didn't know they were about to die until it was too late, the inmates themselves have what seems like a blessing at first, but upon deeper examination is the greatest curse  knowing the exact hour and day they will die, and having to face it day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute.I'm sorry if this review offends people who are sincere death penalty supporters.  I still consider myself to be one, but my thinking has been reformed somewhat and I'm more ready to listen to the opponents and try to make compromises; maybe that's what this issue needs more than anything.  I will say finally that ONE part of this film did offend me as a Catholic the symbolic crucifixion of Poncelet during the last words scene.  That was the one place where Robbins strayed from his even-handed approach to the issue -- the only one I could find.In all, this was a fine film that made me rethink an explosive issue, and I recommend it highly to anyone debating the pros and cons.

It looked so good from the commercials, and the plotline seemed like it could be milked for a lot of drama and tension. I missed it in theatres, and just rented it last night. And you know what--I'm glad I didn't pay 8.50 for this garbage.Alice (Danes) and Darlene (Beckinsale) are recent high school graduates and best friends, looking for one last fling before Darlene goes off to college. They decide to lie to their parents about a trip to Hawaii and head off to Thailand. After only a short time there, they meet Nick, a charming Aussie who steals both their hearts. After a night of flirting, he offers to take them to Hong Kong for a day or so. They agree, and plan to meet him there. But when they get to the airport, heroin is found in Alice's bag, and the two girls are imprisoned for it. Soon, they are taken to a women's prison, called Brokedown Palace, where they must work through their parents and Yankee Hank Green (Pullman) to prove their innocence and be freed.Great storyline, with a lot of potential. But sadly, it is executed horribly. I don't even know where to begin with the flaws. First of all, this is such lighthearted film, and downplays everything. Second of all, the acting. Danes is alright at some points, but then goes overboard with the teen attitude. Beckinsale is a priss who reacts as if she stole someone's boyfriend. Pullman is alright, but too been there, done that, and really doesn't seem to care. I also couldn't stand some of the people in the Brokedown Palace. The Jamaican girl was alright, but why was she allowed to have a Walkman, when Alice was beaten for having a piece of fruit? The blonde was believable, but what about the bully? That one girl who always made fun of Alice was so out of place and useless. Didn't add much tension to the situation. And then there was that one prison guard who was a b**** in some scenes, but sweet and smiling in others.The other thing that bothered me was the freedom of visitation. Alice and Darlene are allowed to meet with their friends and Darlene's father from across the bridge, but still...it was far too perplexing. And did anyone notice that the actor who played Danes's boyfriend (the blonde guy) looked almost identical to the one who played Nick? I have a feeling they were the same people.One other gripe was the ending. Unexpected, but still, it didn't fit. There is no explanation as to where the heroin came from and how it got into Alice's bag, and Alice was so optimistic in the final scene! Also, what ever happened to Nick? Go figure.The only good things were the attempted escape scene, even though it was too easy, and the music. It was quite fitting. Other than that, this was a bomb. I do not recommend it. Instead, for one of those stranger in a strange land movies, try the very intense, Not Without My Daughter, with great acting and non-stop intensity. This is the complete opposite, sorry to say.

It was all a bit reminiscent of  Nashville without the multi-track sound or maybe Pulp Fiction without the blood and gore. All the main characters are facing some kind of personal crisis. Earl Partridge, TV producer of the long running quiz show  What Can Kids Tell Us is lying in his palatial home dying from cancer. His anchorman, Jimmy Gator, has just discovered he too has the big C in terminal form and is trying to break the news to his family. Their brightest kid contestant is revolting over the exploitation of his youthful genius by the show and his father. Donnie, a former top quiz kid on the show now reduced to working in a discount store, has fallen in love with a beefy, boofy barman and is trying to win his love by getting his teeth fixed. Eric and Jimmy, Dads facing Death, are trying to make peace with their estranged children. Eric's son has changed his name, and is now Frank T J Mackie, misogynist motivational speaker who spreads the message that men ought to be bastards, but faces exposure for lying about his background at the hands of  Gwenovier, an elegant black lady journalist who is impervious to his charms. Jimmy's daughter Claudia has fallen victim to cocaine but is about to be the subject of a rehabilitation attempt by a kindly (if a little simple-minded) LAPD officer. Earl's second wife Linda, who married him for his money, is in crisis over Earl's imminent demise, since she now realises she loves him. And Earl's kindly nurse Phil is having a hard time keeping order around the deathbed, what with the dogs and relatives and all. And it's raining all the time - in LA!All is resolved, of course, though with the aid of a supernatural event. My problem is that some viewers will see the ending in literal terms when all we really have is a bunch of clever young film makers sending up soap operas. Still, it's very funny at times and the script allows for some very good performances. There's a galaxy of good actors here - Jason Robards as Earl, Julianne Moore as Earl's wife Linda, Tom Cruise as son Frank, Philip Seymour Hoffman as the nurse, Philip Baker Hall as Jimmy Gator, John C Reilly as the LAPD officer, William H Macy as Donnie the ex-quiz kid, and Jeremy Blackman as the present quiz kid. Tom Cruise was particularly good at projecting Frank's bottled up rage behind his insufferable manner and his scenes with Jason Robards are genuinely moving.Movies like this, set in Hollywood with Hollywood types as characters are in some danger of disappearing up their own fundamental orifices - irrelevant to all except voyeurs.

Perhaps what the film-makers have done is to show us that Hollywood folk suffer just like the rest of us from the human condition.Just a comment re the quiz show (much of the movie has us watching the making of an episode). The questions were ridiculously difficult eg I'll give you a line in English from an opera and you sing it back to me in the original language after telling me which opera it's from. The kid answers perfectly. When he later refuses to answer another question the production assistant hisses You know the answer, you always know. Is the show fixed? Surely that's not still going on?

From now on, black is white, and right is wrong.I, for one, would be curious to know how much screen time Mr. Stone would invest on this aspect of the story if he were making the film today. It really does depends on what side of the glass you are on.

Durabont does it again with The Green Mile.  Tom Hanks plays Paul Edgecomb, a prison guard circa 1930's, with a heart of gold who runs the area of the prison that is death row, and affectionately called 'the green mile'.  Paul and his counterparts believe that a little kindness goes a long way in maintaining their little corner of the world, as they believe their kindness is all that these inmates have left. John Coffeey, a friendly giant played by Michael Clarke Duncan, is the latest visitor to their cell block, who has been convicted of a murder that we know right away he did not commit.  We know this because his only request is that they leave the lights on for him at night as he is afraid of the dark.  One of the big complaints about this film is its running time (almost 3 hours) but I have to say that I wasn't bothered by that one bit.  In fact, I was sorry to see it end.  Over the course of three hours we see several story lines evolve, mostly surrounding Hanks character and the supernatural powers that Duncan's character possesses.  We get a first hand look at capital punishment and the ordeal of facing the electric chair.  While this is a film that rallies against capital punishment, the film does not get mired in its message. Hanks does some fine acting in this role, holding back the temptation to let loose his trademark humor, maintaining a stoicism that would befit a prison guard in this situation.  Duncan is even more interesting to watch.  His blubbering village idiot provides the true heart and the magic (literally) of this moving film. The Green Mile contains some horrific scenes, including a botched execution and a nasty end to a lovable rodent, but even these incidents are tamed down by the warmth that is conveyed by its main characters.  Despite the violence, I would still recommend this film for the whole family.

But others say because of the fact that this movie is violent, offensive, and crude makes it one of the greatest movies of all time. I fall in the later of the two groups.The smart moviegoers make reference to City on Fire and how Reservoir Dogs either resembles, borrows, or rips off from. I don't doubt this but I hadn't heard of City on Fire until Dogs made it big so Lamb better be kissing Tarantino's shoes for making him a hit. I'm sure Lamb is a good director but not too many American film buffs are familiar with the Hong Kong action genre. The majority of America's insight on HK movies go as far as John Woo's Face\/Off and maybe Chow Yun-Fat because of The Replacement Killers and now Jet Li because of Romeo Must Die and Lethal Weapon 4. I'm a big fan of all three men's work but I'm also a big fan of Tarantino's work.Bottom line Give QT the credit he deserves. Maybe his movie resembles Lamb's but does that mean that these two movies are the only one's with diamond heists, Mexican standoffs, undercover cops, and guns? So maybe the storylines are similar but Lamb lacks in one area, he's not Tarantino.Reservoir Dogs works not just because of the story but because of a lot of other elements. Each and every character in this movie has style (even Mr. Blue who had no more than 5 lines) and they all work off each other. What makes this movie great isn't the story but the character's and what they have to say. From Mr. Brown's Like A Virgin speech to Mr. White's Let's get a taco diatribe there's nothing but witty lines and it's this wit that made Tarantino a star.Was this movie too violent, offensive, and crude? HELL YEAH! But isn't that what Tarantino wanted? He wanted us to be shocked, disgusted, and offended because it made the movie memorable. You may hate this movie but you'll never forget Mr. Blonde hacking off Marvin Nash's ear. There are critics out there who say Tarantino's a racist because he uses the word nigger. So does that make Blacks racist because they call each other that? They'll say no because it's just an expression to them and the same is true with OT. Tarantino grew up around Black people and watching Black based movies, one of his favorite actresses is Pam Grier, does that make him a racist? So if you were squeamish by the blood, offended by the words than you just proved that Tarantino's a great writer and movie maker.
