Only 25 years old at the time that it was made, Orson Welles made one of the greatest films of all time. There are not many actors or directors whom I would describe as artists but, in my view, Welles was one of his generation's two greatest artists in the filmmaking sphere, the other being Laurence Olivier. His skills as a director have been much praised over the course of the last 74 years but I want to focus on his skills as an actor first of all. As Charles Foster Kane, Welles is simply magnificent. Through the various flashbacks, we learn about the different sides of the man's character and he excels at playing all of them. Welles plays Kane over a period of more than 50 years and does so with a great deal more passion and gravitas than many actors of comparable age are capable of.The newsreel footage in the first ten minutes is crucial to our understanding of Kane as it not only places his life in chronological order but it gives us insight into the manner in which he is viewed by the public. The former is significant given the film's format of flashbacks while the latter allows us to contrast the public man with the private man. As shown by his genuinely and deeply meant Declaration of Principles and his confrontation with Thatcher, Kane's motives are pure at the beginning of his journalistic career but he becomes more and more ruthless in his pursuit of power as the years and decades pass by. This is best seen in the recollections of Jed Leland, the closest thing that he had a friend. Leland tells the intrepid journalist Jerry Thompson that he did not think that Kane loved anyone except for himself and his mother. The obvious implication from that statement is that Kane married his first wife Emily Norton as she is the niece of the US President. He comes to neglect her but this pales in comparison to the emotional abuse which he inflicts on his second wife Susan Alexander, which eventually leads her to attempt suicide. In spite of Kane's myriad flaws, I felt pity for him as his actions meant that he was left with no one to care about him. He made a fortune but money cannot buy happiness, as is portrayed in the film in an almost Dickensian way. This is best illustrated by the fact that his dying thoughts are of his boyhood sleigh Rosebud. On his deathbed, he recalls the last time in his life that he was truly happy, playing in the snow outside his mother's boarding house. For Kane, the sleigh represents perfect happiness and his own conception of Elysium. Its simplicity serves as a wonderful contrast to the cold opulence of the 49,000 acre estate of Xanadu, which becomes something of a prison to him in his last years. The sleigh's destruction in the film's final scene represents the death of Kane's dream of achieving happiness.Welles and his co-writer Herman J. Mankiewicz gave all of the best bits to the actor-director himself but our understanding of Kane would be nothing without the supporting characters. The most important of these is perhaps Jed Leland, played very well by Welles' close friend Joseph Cotten. He is most effective as the elderly Leland in the flashback scenes and the scene in which Leland, while very drunk, tells Kane exactly what he thinks of him after he loses the gubernatorial election. Leland remains constant throughout the film and this provides another fantastic contrast, this time to Kane himself. If you look carefully, you can also spot Cotten as one of the journalists shrouded in darkness after the newsreel has been played. Dorothy Comingore is excellent as Susan Alexander, a well meaning but not terribly bright or talented young woman whose life is gradually destroyed by Kane. He had something to prove in building the opera house for her and does not allow her to stop singing because he would be too embarrassing for him, not caring at all about the affect that the humiliation is having on her. The rest of the cast is very strong as well, particularly Everett Sloane as the ever loyal Mr Bernstein, George Coulouris as Walter Parks Thatcher, Ruth Warrick as Emily Norton Kane, Ray Collins as Jim Gettys, William Alland as Jerry Thompson and Paul Stewart as Kane's callous butler Raymond. The most interesting of the minor characters is Kane's mother Mary, played wonderfully by Agnes Moorehead.The manner in which the film was shot was absolutely innovative in its time and it still looks beautiful. Welles and the cinematographer Gregg Toland pioneered the technique of deep focus for the silver screen in which every part of the frame is in focus simultaneously. This is perhaps best illustrated by the scene in which Mary Kane makes Thatcher her son's legal guardian while the young Kane can be seen playing in the background. What makes it even more impressive is that most of this scene is shot in a single take, as are numerous other scenes in the film. Another very impressively shot scene is the party scene in which Kane celebrates coaxing the Daily Chronicle's best journalists to defect to the Inquirer after six years of trying. this scene involves Kane and numerous chorus girls singing and dancing in the background while Leland and Bernstein have a private conversation in the foreground. At several points, we see Kane reflected in the window on the other side of them. This must have been a logistical nightmare for Welles to shoot but he did it brilliantly.

A serial rapist attacks a student and the new hot-shot brash doctor Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) saves her life. Andy realizes that Jed is a popular former high school classmate. Andy's wife Tracy (Nicole Kidman) is a children school teacher and his former student. Andy rents out their third floor to Jed but he's a bad tenant. Andy finds the dead body of student Paula Bell (Gwyneth Paltrow) and detective Dana Harris (Bebe Neuwirth) sees him as a suspect despite being his friend. Tracy suffers a rupture of an ovarian cyst. A drunk Jed operates and mistakenly takes out both ovaries as well as causing a miscarriage. Tracy blames Andy for allowing it to happen as she sues Jed.The movie is overloaded with red herring, blind twist and subplots where a serial killer actually dead ends to nothing but a random guy. At some point, I wonder what this movie is really about. It has so much plot that it sinks under its own weight. It may hurt Aaron Sorkin physically but he needed to simplify the story.

It is currently available on NetFlix Instant Download Streaming. The writers are Ronald Roose and David Griffiths. The cast includes Arnold Schwartzenegger, Francesca Neri, Elias Kotaeas, Cliff Curtis and John Leguizamo. 'Collateral Damage' was, of course, one of those films whose original release date had to be postponed in the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks. In this case, the sensitivity arose as a result of the film's storyline, which revolves around a group of Colombian terrorists determined to strike at targets on American soil. Schwarzenegger plays fireman Gordy Brewer, whose wife and child are killed in an explosion at the Colombian consulate in Los Angeles. Brewer, feeling that the U.S. government has little concern with exacting revenge from the terrorist leader responsible for the explosion, decides to mount a one-man crusade to see that justice is ultimately done. The film, obviously indifferent to its own need for plausibility, sends this virtually unarmed fireman into the unfamiliar jungles of South America to take on what appears to be the entire Colombian police force as well as the guerilla fighters whose actions resulted in the deaths of Brewer's family. Brewer, of course, despite his own inexperience and the formidable odds against him, manages to talk and\/or fight his way out of every dire predicament before rescuing his nemesis' wife and their adopted son.

We enjoy a little shiver of appreciation as we greet each character taking part in this superlative caper. Along the way we savor wonderful snippets of psychology brought to life -- the crooked cop interacting with his loan shark, the wimpy guy wrapping himself around the pinky of his slutty wife, the timid bookkeeper anesthetizing himself with booze to cope with the reality of his actions. The whole thing is expertly choreographed by the supremely confident alpha male played by Sterling Hayden. He thinks he's got his ducks lined up but doesn't plan on the inevitable crap that always somehow hits the fan in this life.They've got their problems and they've all got a little larceny in them, he tells his moll, Fay, played tremulously by Coleen Gray (I'm not pretty and I'm not very smart, so please don't leave me alone anymore!). Here we meet the likes of Marvin Unger (a crinkly browed Jay C.

How about Kola Kwanani, the fight provocateur (read this Ukrainian wrestler's Wikipedia entry and weep)?; Vince Edwards as Sherry's slimy lover; James Edwards as a fascinating parking-lot attendant, and a threateningly mugged actor (whose name I couldn't discern) as a racehorse assassin.

Having now seen the film, I know why my Dad--an auto mechanic and racing enthusiast who also loved westerns--would have enjoyed this movie. The film opens with a dynamic chase scene that features quite a bit of suspense. The result of this scene sets up the plot of the rest of the movie. Mad Max is a policeman in a dystopian future who winds up having a motorcycle gang out to get him. The plot basically involves the back and forth between these two entities, and proceeds fairly predictably. I enjoyed this movie just fine. It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, by far, but it's watchable, albeit the setting could be a bit confusing if you don't know the background of the film going into it. The futuristic scene is never spelled out for you, so you kind of have to figure that much out on your own. And of course it's all taking place in Australia, and so the accents make it a bit of a foreign film to American ears. Still, it's enjoyable over all. It follows a standard antihero formula akin to a Clint Eastwood movie (either his westerns or the Dirty Harry movies). All in all I'd give this movie 7\/10 stars.

The only reason I'm even giving this a mediocre five is that it provides the origin story for Mad Max. The special effects are cheesy, the acting mediocre, and the story and characters rudimentary and undeveloped. It is interesting though to see a young Mel Gibson, who is incidentally almost unrecognizable. Still, even with its glaring defects, it's a must see because it fills in the Mad Max backstory. Basically a really weak film though, even allowing for its age and obvious low budget. Quite surprising that such a solid franchise had such an inauspicious start. Powerful ammunition for the old adage that if at first you don't succeed, try, try again.

Of course, I do fully realize that Jaws was just-a-movie - But, all the same, I'm hardly convinced that a shark (especially one of this predator's apparent cunning) would ever behave as this one inevitably did in its hot pursuit of Quint and his 2-man crew on-board the Orca.If you ask me - This great white rogue of the ocean was just too obviously dumb for words. Believe me, this blood-thirsty beast was just asking to be killed. (And, yep, in the end, its wish came true) In conclusion - From where I was sitting - 1975's Jaws was yet another one of those ridiculous, big-budget movies that (now 40 years old) still manages to be grossly over-rated for reasons that I'd say are, for the most part, quite unfounded.

It opens with Chow Yun-Fat holding off three Chinese thugs in a Chinatown antique store and he releases them with a warning. Mark Wahlberg enters as Yun-Fat's new partner. Yun-Fat handles the physical while Wahlberg is skilled at making arrests and eventually there is an undercover cop present during one of the arrests. He also discovers homeless people in a tunnel locked away, which can answer questions regarding dead women in dumpsters. There is much martial arts fighting with James Foley in fine tune as director. He previously made At Close Range and The Chamber but this is not exactly a step up despite his knack for pitching action scenes. Yun-Fat and Wahlberg have decent chemistry and their roles are broader than at first appears. They are complete opposites that test waters with each other until the big action ass kicking in the conclusion. Brian Cox, Ric Young and Kim Chan are flat in those typical cardboard supporting roles. This is really about the two leads in what appears to be typical buddy flick formula. Well made technically, purposed as an action film, but it could have been much more. Instead it corrupts viewers with its showcase and stupidity.
