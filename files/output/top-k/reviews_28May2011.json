The film suffers from a rough script and was rushed into production before the script could be perfected, it was released into theaters only a year after part 4 came out. While I can understand this argument, I would argue that almost all of the Friday The 13th films were rushed into production and were also released a year after their predecessors and were far worse then what this movie did. Most people point out this movie's faceless characters but again, I would argue that Friday The 13th has done a lot worse when it comes to character development and yet, these films are not criticized for the same reason.While this isn't a great movie and no where close to the original John Carpenter film, I still feel that it includes some of the most epic scenes in the entire series, more so then the highly praised Halloween 4. The final 30 minutes are thrilling and the ending leaves you wanting more because you're not sure what's going to happen next. I also think that this film added new story elements that were interesting. This film is also much darker and even Gothic I think.

Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, sadly, never were given better parts. Leigh lived to be nearly 80 years old, so this part must have been somewhat of a annoyance to her. It probably didn't help that she had one of the most famous ex-husbands and daughters in the world. We all know what fate had in store for Perkins.Seen today, the movie is a bit tame and slow at times, but what it must have felt like for a 60s audience to see a film that was basically about sexual desires, although no explicit sex is shown. Look at one of the first scenes, where Marion is talking to an investor. He checks her out from top to bottom and makes an obvious play for her in full public. I can't recall I have ever seen such a scene from a movie that was made in the early sixties, and have rarely seen it in a movie made up and until 1966. The reaction from Hitchcock's daughter is also rare to see in a mainstream film from that time. She just treats it like it was something that happens every day. That was particularly unheard of during the rather strict 50s.More talk about sex. Janet Leigh in the white and black bra. I still don't know how they got that past the censors at that time. Hitchcock must have had an enormous field day with those shots. Also, the shots of Leigh's stand-in, where you actually see a very quick shot of breasts. Unbelievable. It's funny to dwell on this today where you can see pornography every minute of the day but for a 60s audience? That took a lot of guts to put that in.As for story, it is not the most original. Mamas boys were well depicted even to the point of insanity as way back as Jimmy Cagney's part in The Public Enemy. The execution, however, was of course something new.

They even sold PBR's during the movie so that made things that much better. So is this movie a classic, I say alright alright. This is a cult classic more geared towards the stoner crowd of which I am a proud member. What affirmed for me the notion that this movie is a cult classic is the overwhelming abundance of people (including me) who were saying the lines of the movie out loud in the theater. The fact that so many people remembered so many great lines I think says it all. And that is one of the great things about this movie the story and the dialog in particular. The great cult film maker Richard Linklater, didn't just develop fascinating characters, he gave them many many many memorable things to say. This movie is also nostalgic, for even though it takes place in the 70's, I identified with the whole suburban growing up and making the transition from middle school to high school and going from underclassman to the all powerful senior class thing (that was a mouth full). I also identified with a lot of what these characters did to have fun when they were young and stupid. Look, I don't know if this movie is for everyone, as I said it is a stoner cult classic, but Richard Linklater has given us not just fun movies to watch like this and school of rock, but a pair of great romance movies in before sunrise and before sunset, some really deep philosophical vehicles, in slacker and waking life, and last but not least the imaginative a scanner darkly which showcases the very beautiful filming technique known as interpolated rotoscoping, which Linlater was the first to utilize for an entire film. In addition to all this, this film launched the careers of actors like Matthew McConaughey and Ben Affleck. Look the point of all this is, this is not just a great film, it was made by one of today's most interesting film directors, and gives a look at budding stardom.

Rififi (slang word for a street fight) deals with a hold-up in the beginning but turns into a revenge story while approaching to its end. The 30 minutes silence sequence in which the robbery takes place is certainly a masterpiece, as a matter of fact I didn't even realise it was so long and not even that it was completely noiseless! (so absorbed was I). But it is the only really worth thing within the movie.Some of the actors are good, especially Jean Servais (who had become a top star in the 30's but was in his low days at the time Rififi was being made) and the director, Jules Dassin, who plays César, the Italian specialist in safes. This movie tries to poorly imitate her American contemporaries but then again, fails. It is sooo folkloric the club shown in the movie is called L'âge d'or (paying homage to Luis Buñuel), a woman sings a local song which gives the movie its title (this reminds me of Jean Vigo's 'L'atalante' which the producers released under the title 'La chaland qui passe', name of a very popular song at the time). It, to sum up, is plain french fries without the main course.The film has influenced popular culture so much that a lot of films released in Europe in the following years would be called Rififi whatever... Even the word riffraff is said to be originated from this term. It was the film that showed that Europe could do good film noirs too, only that I can't agree. Even Truffaut said about it the best film noir I've ever seen. Well, his words are never to be believed since he is sooo french he preferred the french dubbed version of 'Fahrenheit 451' rather than the original (no comment on that).The female character was one of the worst I ever saw in film history, being treated like an ornament, but the main problem is the pace, most french films have always been so slow it almost makes someone doze off on the chair; besides, the plot twist (which should be one of the pros and quickly becomes a con) turns the movie into a stupid vengeance thriller in which Servais struggles to change his character into some sort of tough cowboy in lust for revenge. Pathetic. Near the end, we see an abandoned place which reminds very much of the one shown in 'The french connection', only in the latter it wasn't so pathetic. A fight of egos takes place and everyone loses, above all the movie. So don't waste your time on this, if you wanna see a hold-up you should see Kubrick's 'The Killing'.

(so absorbed was I). But it is the only really worth thing within the movie.Some of the actors are good, especially Jean Servais (who had become a top star in the 30's but was in his low days at the time Rififi was being made) and the director, Jules Dassin, who plays César, the Italian specialist in safes. This movie tries to poorly imitate her American contemporaries but then again, fails. It is sooo folkloric the club shown in the movie is called L'âge d'or (paying homage to Luis Buñuel), a woman sings a local song which gives the movie its title (this reminds me of Jean Vigo's 'L'atalante' which the producers released under the title 'La chaland qui passe', name of a very popular song at the time). It, to sum up, is plain french fries without the main course.The film has influenced popular culture so much that a lot of films released in Europe in the following years would be called Rififi whatever... Even the word riffraff is said to be originated from this term. It was the film that showed that Europe could do good film noirs too, only that I can't agree. Even Truffaut said about it the best film noir I've ever seen. Well, his words are never to be believed since he is sooo french he preferred the french dubbed version of 'Fahrenheit 451' rather than the original (no comment on that).The female character was one of the worst I ever saw in film history, being treated like an ornament, but the main problem is the pace, most french films have always been so slow it almost makes someone doze off on the chair; besides, the plot twist (which should be one of the pros and quickly becomes a con) turns the movie into a stupid vengeance thriller in which Servais struggles to change his character into some sort of tough cowboy in lust for revenge. Pathetic. Near the end, we see an abandoned place which reminds very much of the one shown in 'The french connection', only in the latter it wasn't so pathetic. A fight of egos takes place and everyone loses, above all the movie. So don't waste your time on this, if you wanna see a hold-up you should see Kubrick's 'The Killing'.

I remember it playing on Toon Disney (now Disney XD, respectively) at around 330pm when I was in the third grade. I used to rush home and watch it before carrying on with my homework. It was childhood nostalgia at its finest. I wasn't introduced to the series till around 2004 or 2005, so when the film came out in 2001 I had no interest in seeing it because, well, I didn't know what it was.It wasn't until about six months of watching the show I finally found Recess School's Out and watched it. Back then, I thought it was one of the greatest animated movies of all time. I was shown it again at the end of the year in forth grade when the whole grade watched it at once. Memories like that will never die for me.Not seeing this since around sixth grade, I used to rewatch it at least twice a year, seeing it again in 2011 kind of saddened me. I hesitate to watch old animated films I adored as a kid and some films like Fools Rush In which was a kid favorite of mine because I fear of tarnishing my memories of those movies. I remember them to be amazing and hilarious. When reality catches up to me, most of my childhood favorites are only average pieces of film.First of all, the film focuses on a bizarre storyline. T.J. Detweiller's forth grade year comes to an end and he has plans of riding bikes, camping out, and just hanging out with his five friends Mikey, Spinelli, Gretchen, Gus, and Vince. Only problem; they are all going to some sort of camp for most of the summer leaving T.J. secluded.T.J. spends his first days of summer riding his bike and moping, like any kid with no friends over the summer would do. He notices strange activity going on in the school. There is a giant laser beam, satellite monstrosity inside of it and when he goes to the principal for help, the principal is dematerialized right before his eyes after trying to unlock the front door.It turns out, that Dr. Phillium Benedict, former principal of the school, is trying to realign the moon to make a year round winter so summer vacation will be obsolete. His obsession with test scores and improvement leads to this chaos, so T.J. rounds up the gang to have an adventure and save their summer from extinction.The plot is entertaining, but it is unbelievably strange and awkward. Eliminating summer vacation? I could see that. Hell, it is already happening in some schools. But I don't know if any proctor is planning to realign the moon. Another thing, where are the neighbors to the school? Don't they see the laser beam come out? And who wouldn't notice the long beam of green light light up the sky? The police are absolutely no help either. I can understand if a kid comes in saying people are in a school with a laser beam and the cops not believe him. But if multiple people, even adults, came in saying nearly the same thing don't you think the police would at least investigate. In order for this plot to work, half the town has to be a bunch of unaware nitwits.And for a kids movie, it doesn't really have any attract factor for adults. The sixties music and the retro scenes are actually something adults may like. They only last for a short while though. Some scenes in this film like the scene of T.J. riding his bike with One is the Loneliest Number and the end credits with the whole Recess gang covering My Green Tambourine was actually the most favorable parts of the movie. I remember from my youth watching those scenes.The animation is a bit different from the show. The show was hand drawn, and the movie is CGI. In 2001, CGI still wasn't a normal thing for all animated films. It's that awkward period between the past and the present. The buildings look blocky, but the characters look great. It isn't the beauty and remarkable quality Toy Story has, but animation isn't everything. It gets by.Recess ranks up with the biggest nostalgic memories with me. While appreciating the movie when I was younger, the movie doesn't really serve more as a purpose than an extra trip to the theater. This could've easily been a TV movie, but maybe Recess deserved a film adaptation to the big screen.

This is a deliberately unsettling exploration of jealousy, sexual curiosity and deviance masked under a morality tale against adultery and drug-taking...I think. Kubrick's very adult film takes us into the world of successful New York doctor Tom Cruise (Dr Bill Harford) and Nicole Kidman and from the simple opening of them leaving their infant child in the charge of their baby-sitter to attend a glitzy Christmas party hosted by the mega-rich Sydney Pollack, sees them subject to sexual temptation with third parties (two for one in Cruise's case) from which they just about extricate themselves. However, post-party and back in their own bed, we see them smoking a joint and gradually fashion an argument, culminating in Kidman's shocking admission to her husband about a sexual fantasy she had over a soldier some time before, even when in her husband's company. One surprise call for Cruise to attend the death of his old mentor gives him the opportunity to explore his darker side and attempt to expiate the vision of Kidman and her fantasy love which fuels his actions.I can't claim to understand the many facets of this strong film but was certainly held from one discomfiting scene to the next. First Cruise is almost seduced by the grieving daughter of the dead man whom he's attending, then he similarly pulls back from a liaison with a kindly (as it turns out very kindly prostitute) thanks to a timely phone call from his wife, before finally his curiosity and motivations get the better of him and he gate-crashes a sinister masqued orgy where apparently anything goes but in truth all is carefully orchestrated, monitored and controlled. On the way though, he witnesses a troubling situation at the fancy-dress shop whose owner he gets up after hours to furnish him with the required disguise for the ball, with the owner's obviously barely pubescent daughter is caught almost in-flagrante with what appears to be a father and son Oriental pair.The centrepiece of the film and the one that perhaps demonstrates Kubrick's powers most is the orgy scene. A deliberately constructed long slow tease of a scene with the viewer made to follow Cruise's subjective voyeuristic gaze as he wanders through the plush, massive rooms of the secret mansion, witnessing sexual acts performed in dumb show for the specially invited guests to a backdrop of a gloomy but haunting piano refrain. Thus we the viewer feel the danger of the faceless Mr Big who catches Cruise out in his deception who to protect the anonymity and exclusivity of his parties that he will extract the highest price to deter interlopers in the future.I found myself carried along uneasily on Cruise's coat-tails and of course are made to examine our own morality and sexual mores and even as it seems both Cruise may have just about learned his lesson, that shocking last word on camera of Kidman's perhaps gives the lie to that. Of course it could all have been a drug-fuelled dream\/nightmare of Cruise's, which would help explain the enigmatic title of the movie...Both leads are very good in what must have been difficult parts to play, especially as they were of course married at the time. The support players were all as significant but unobtrusive as they needed to be. However it's in the orchestration of the set, actors, lighting, camera movement and music that one sees a great director at work. I doubt I could have been persuaded subject matter like this without knowing that the likes if Kubrick was behind the camera.As it happened, it turned out of course to be his last movie and what a demanding, challenging, even risky one it turned out to be. While I couldn't argue it as the best movie in his oeuvre, it is obviously the work of a major talent and testimony that he maintained his considerable powers to the end.

That is why I usually avoid from watching horror movies. However this time I had to watch Rosemary's Baby because we watched it at the school for listening and pronunciation lesson. I shut my eyes at some scenes and my instructor blurred one scene. However I was able to watch most of the movie and I found it nice, to my surprise. While we were watching the movie, one of my friends said that she had read the book of the movie but the ending was different from what she said us. It made the end surprising for me although the plot was predictable.According to my opinion this movie is about the unreliability of people and that the true self of people is how different from their appearance. Although I have met with similar plots before, I found the plot creative and intriguing. The ending was sudden and weird. I think I expected a different ending, maybe something is more usual. I found the acting successful especially Ruth Gordon's. In my opinion she deserved the Oscar which she was given. I think I am going to remember Mia Farrow's desperate face for a long time.The music was good in a way that frightened me who prefer to watch movies while the sound is off and read the subtitles. Especially the lullaby which plays at the beginning and end of the movie made me think that something bad and mysterious was going to happen in this movie. I also liked the poster which was suitable for the atmosphere of the movie. All in all do not marry to an ambitious person and rent an apartment in an infamous building just in case you found yourself in Rosemary's pitiful position.

It is generally, although not universally, accepted that Lee Harvey Oswald was indeed a 'patsy' and set up to take the wrap, and that the Warren Commission and its report were a rather hamfisted whitewash. But that is about all we can safely allow ourselves to believe to know, and everything else is still as clear as mud. The problem with Stone's JFK is that it is first and foremost a fiction, with fictional elements which, although intended to demonstrate a higher 'dramatic' truth, are still made up, invented, constructed. For all I know the thesis of the film is wholly accurate (although one website in particular has dedicated itself to debunking much of Stone's film). On the other hand it might well be wholly inaccurate, and it doesn't seem that we will be able to know definitively one way or the other any time soon. But when considering Stone's film JFK, the one thing we must never forget is that it is a fiction and furthermore, given the nature of Hollywood filmmaking, one produced for commercial gain. So, for example, it includes several wholly fictional characters, of which the gay hustler Willie O'Keeffe and the assistant DA Bill Bruissard are just two and severa wholly fictional scenes.Yet many people &#x96; in fact, a great many people &#x96; will have walked out of the cinema after watching JFK believing that the Kennedy murder mystery has finally been solved, that the conspiracy was, in the words of the film's DA Jim Garrison, nothing less than a coup d'etat backed by the military industrial complex of the US which saw Kennedy as bad for business. According to Stone's film that coup d'etat and the assassination conspiracy were achieved with the backing of the CIA, the FBI and Dallas' police department. And, what is even more alarming is that, given the potency of film, Stone's &#x96; fictional - account might well in time become the accepted and definitive account. But I'll repeat we have no way of knowing how much or how little of it is true or even close to true.By chance I have been reading another analysis of the assassination by the British writer Anthony Summers (and was thus already familiar with many of the names of the whole affair's protagonists). Summer's book is not a work of fiction but attempts to sift through the confusion of fact and evidence surrounding Oswald. Although Summers is at pains to avoid being seen to 'solve the case' and states that his objective is simply to lay out the evidence as we know it, his book does suggest strongly that there was Mafia involvement in Kennedy's murder and, even more so that, of anti-Castro Cuban exiles. In this writer's view, assassination by Cuban exiles with the assistance of the Mafia (who hated Kennedy and his brother Robert) and rather a lot of rogue elements in the CIA and FBI, strikes me as being a great deal more plausible than the man being bumped of by his own side, not least of whom was the man who succeeded Kennedy as president (and who apparently reversed Kennedy's policy to pull out of Vietnam and instead escalated US involvement in the conflict. Yet that, very plausible and well-documented aspect of the assassination is not even hinted at in Stone's film. There is not a whisper of Cuban exiles, despite Oswald's well-known dealings with them. Summers agrees that there was a great deal of very odd CIA, FBI and Dallas police department behaviour, but does not suggest that this was official policy (rather, he believes that official stubbornness which covered up a great deal of odd behaviour by the security forces stemmed from a proud esprit de corps, my side right or wrong) at no point does anything he writes suggest that a coup d'etat lay at the core of the assassination.That, on the other hand, lies at the heart of Stone's film, and the meeting between Garrison and the mysterious Mr X (a disillusioned high-up soldier who claimed he ran a black ops unit) is pivotal. So what is it? Who's right? Your guess is as good as mine. But don't take Stone's film as the gospel truth. If you decide to see it (by now most probably in DVD) always bear in mind that this is a fictional work of art, and that Stone is on record as having his own agenda.But what of JFK as a film? Well, if it is possible to divorce the 'film' from its contentious subject matter &#x96; which is, of course, almost impossible &#x96; then JFK should get very good marks indeed. It is well-shot, well-acted, well-edited and well-imagined. Had it dealt with some other assassination, and one which was not as central to a sensitive American psyche, it would be top-notch. As it is &#x85; well until and when JFK can be views with a little more objectivity, it is almost impossible to judge.Remember this is a fictional piece of art.

M takes this rather personally and makes it top priority to find people responsible. James Bond becomes convinced that the assassination was planned by terrorist Renard, who years earlier had kidnapped King's daughter Elektra, and is now back for revenge. M sends Bond to protect Elektra, as she might be the next victim.Bond series had managed to keep a very good quality up for the past two decades. From For Your Eyes Only to Tomorrow Never Dies there had been only good Bond movies, with couple excellent in between. So it was only a matter of time before quality would drop again. To be fair this movie does have all the right ingredients for a good Bond film great action, thought through script and good actors, so what is wrong with it then? It's boring. I have to be honest, I was bored by this film. There's nothing really new here, none of the characters were all that interesting and I just couldn't bring myself to care what was happening and to whom.Another thing is that minor characters are far more interesting than main ones. Pierce Brosnan still carries the role with the same pride as in two previous ones and I am a bit impressed by that. However there's nothing all that memorable of either Sophie Marceau or Robert Carlyle, who play Elektra and Renard. Both are serious about their job, but neither can live up to the high standards of Bond girls and villains. I'm also confused if Carlyle is trying to imitate Donald Pleasence's creepy unblinking stare from You Only Live Twice or if it was just a coincidence. At least neither of them is as badly miscast though as Denise Richards as Dr. Christmas Jones. Denise Richards is eye candy for sure, but her playing nuclear physicist is as convincing as having Pamela Anderson to play brain surgeon.The highlights of this movie are Judi Dench as M who gets to actually have a larger part this time than typically M has in Bond movies, as well as Robbie Coltrane who reprises his role as Valentin Zukovsky from GoldenEye, stealing every scene he's in. This is also the last movie to feature Desmond Llewelyn as Q, a role he played in 17 Bond films all together since From Russia with Love. The filmmakers had Q retire in this film, since Llewelyn was quite old and ill already, and be replaced by strangely forgettable John Cleese. Q's last scene, knowing Llewelyn died soon after the film was made, is strangely touching.All in all, The World is Not Enough has its moments, but it is still below average Bond film that didn't impress me and where supporting cast steals the show from lead players.

A widowed field mouse, Mrs. Brisby, must save her ailing son Timothy from dying from pneumonia while protecting him and the rest of her family from the farmer's tractor, the farmer's cat, and an assortment of other dangers that puts this young mouse to the test.If I went into detail as to why this film is great it would take a few hours at best. All I can say is, if you see this movie sitting on the shelf of your local film store, or see it online it is definitely worth the watch. Truly it is Don Bluth's magnum opus.

But a very different kind. It is not the kind of romance that Matthew McCoughney usually plays in. It is about destructing love and most of their intimate moments are showing them getting high together. Sid shows his romantic feelings by for example hitting his head against the brick wall to make Nancy feel better. Sid is an interesting character. He isn't supposed to be very talented and yet has the character that punk represents which makes him so famous. Gary Oldmann was brilliant in this movie. He is very intense and portrays Sid Vicious flawlessly, he seem to have captured a lot of his mannerisms. I was not that thrilled by Chloe Webb. Courtney Love, who also has a small role in it, wanted to play the part of Nancy and I wish she did. My main problem with the movie is that it drags too much.

Hoffman plays it straight (in a manner of speaking), and even though the film has many funny moments, there's also an understated nuance in the way he handles his character in serious situations. I'll have to credit that to Hoffman's unique ability to take entirely disparate characters and make them his own, just as he did with Ratso Rizzo, Jack Crabb and Raymond Babbitt.The supporting players here are first rate, and perfectly cast to match their characters. The surprise for me was seeing director Sidney Pollack in front of the camera as Michael Dorsey's agent. My favorite scene is the one where Michael reveals he's Dorothy, and Pollack is completely beside himself with disbelief. It's just what you'd expect from an agent who just reamed his most temperamental client for being impossible to work with.The picture does have it's expected situations that attempt to compromise Dorothy Michaels' relationship with men, but they're intelligently done and don't resort to slapstick. Les Nichols' (Charle Durning) attempt to romance Dorothy was handled discreetly by the script, and the ensuing confrontation between the two as men was handled professionally. This all could have been done quite differently with an over the top approach to Michael Dorsey's 'womanhood', but then you would have had a mediocre film filled with stereotype and caricature.

This is solid within any measure you consider for such a type of film. A kind of anti-film, an expression of mood instead of story, contemplation instead of reflection. The 70', in the twilight of the 60' were ideal for this. This is not about changing the world as much as it is about contemplating it, being in it, or deliberately outside it, while acknowledging it, like the characters in this film. That's why in the 70' we had the more truly introspective and deep antonionis, we had mood creation even in the underground stuff of Monte Hellman's cockfighter. And at this point, we had the unknown Malick, whose background is one of philosophy and not of cinema. He is a thinker more than a filmmaker.Yet he delivered in his few cinema iterations some of the most profound visual experiences ever. Here he sticks to the mood formula, i guess because this is his first film, and he couldn't or wouldn't stretch the chances more than he felt he'd control them. So he delivers a recognizable shape of a film, while pouring in it the juices of what he would master, in later years. The genre is fully hardwired in film goers all over the world, it is a classic in American film. But Malick's intentions are elsewhere. He's no Coen, never wanted to be. He doesn't want to pick a genre and subvert it as much as he wanted to disembody the whole picture. That's why he chose this story, about to characters fully dropped in the nothing, successively killing all the links to a regular recognizable world. The latent madness justifies what Malick does. And what he does is interlace bits, fragments of countless motifs. Parallel narratives which make no sense to the main narrative (if there's any) other than just being there. One of the best compliments i can make to a film and a filmmaker is that he or it are able to place us in a specific more or less possible alternative world. That's the main goal of film. Malick pushes that goal further. We are never in the film. Instead we float around, uncertain about where or when we are, or more fundamentally, what we are, as viewers, what's our placement in the narrative. This film is still pretty raw, we see the intentions (now that we've seen what he built after this) and there are bits of the film where we get to that state of undetermined wonder.
