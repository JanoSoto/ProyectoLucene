Well, in this case it does mean the movie is good I'm not going to forget Arlington Road for the rest of my life. This is a compliment for a movie I had wanted to watch for a lot of years before I watched it some days ago.Why didn't I watch it? I don't know. Do I regret it? Big time, because I didn't find the movie as innovating as it seemed to be a long time ago, and consequently I didn't find it very good; as I probably would have a long time ago. Is that I have seen so many movies of this type, you know? With a twist in the end and tension all the way through&#133;Most of them weren't even good so I lost faith in the genre and its originality.Arlington Road is a perfect example for a good film in the genre, which also combines various other elements and luckily develops its plot directly through the characters, when everything now is still making sense mostly through the actions. Ehren Kruger, a very talented writer whose credits include The Ring and The Skeleton Key, failed to make way for its mind-blowing conclusion in the latter film a couple of years ago. But with Arlington Road, many years before, everything in her screenplay fit fine, making the conclusion more than satisfying and still mind-blowing.The story about Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) a man still suffering because of his wife's death and teaching a terrorism university course because she was an agent, while he deals with his troubled son; Arlington Road begins with a breathtaking first scene full of film-making potential, where Michael saves a kid from bleeding to death; taking him to the ER without knowing his name. Soon he finds out from his parents, Oliver (Tim Robbins) and Cheryl (Joan Cusack) that the kid is his neighbor from across the street. They've been living here for weeks, I save the boy's life and I don't even know his name, Michael tells Brooke (Hope Davis) the day after.We admire Angelo Badalamenti's score and Bobby Bukowski's cinematography from the start. Director Mark Pellington, after having done music videos, went strong after the big screen&#133;Succeeding, fortunately. Michel Gondry made the transaction from music videos to films beautifully and successfully; imposing his imaginative vision of the world in his movies. On the other hand, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (directors of Little Miss Sunshine) amazed with the simplicity of their images after leaving the music video scene. Besides these two, not many directors are really successful in penetrating their ideas into film after music videos&#133; Pellington did it right, and in the movie everything appears new, attractive and not excessive (in the use of the resources); therefore not tiring for the viewer. As Pellington worked, the whole piece worked out. Never tiring, the story becomes more unpredictable by the minute and the tension never stops. The best thing about this is that the actors end up disappearing in their characters. It is not a long film, but there's a point where everyone seems to have not enough energy left.I said Kevin Spacey and Samuel Jackson were a great acting duo in The Negotiator. Here, Robbins and Bridges are not better; but their merit is. Without the action and the explosions of the police procedure, their work becomes something passively violent. In conversations barely with movement, their faces have to be enough to say what's written on the script.

The lines between fantasy & reality become ever more blurred, then he is contacted by an ex army mate Paul (Pruitt Taylor Vince) who confides in him that he too is experiencing the same symptom's & that he is going to hell. Shortly after Paul is killed when his car blows up, Jacob thinks it might be an army conspiracy & that they were 'given' something during their time in Vietnam. Can Jacob discover the truth before he completely loses his mind?Directed Adian Lyne this is an usual psychological horror thriller which forces you to think about it & the themes & issues it raises & isn't that straight forward. The script by Bruce Joel Rubin which takes itself extremely seriously is a pretty complex piece of work, it initially comes across as a detailed character study of Jacob but then throws in lots of conspiracy theory's, strange dialogue & a simple yet effective ending where you'll have to rearrange things in your head & come to a conclusion that suits your own interpretation of events. Jacob's Ladder is a well written film for sure with good central character's you care for & draw you into the story, it has some memorable dialogue, it has numerous twists & turns, it manages to blur the boundaries between fantasy & reality within the film so your never quite sure what your watching or in what context your watching it. As a whole I thought the story was very engaging & it hooked me, I think most people will want to see how this turns out & will want to follow it right through to the end. On the negative side I don't think I'd want to see it again anytime soon, it's perhaps a touch too long at almost 2 hours although having said that I'm not sure what I'd want to see less of.Director Lyne does a good job of portraying a gritty harsh New York, the film has a few creepy moments & some off beat imagery including Jezebel appearing to be raped by some tentacled creature! There's plenty of religious symbolism too with constant references to heaven & hell, overall I'd say Jacob's Ladder has an unsettling atmosphere to it. There's a touch of gore including some gory Vietnam footage & severed limbs but this is all about the story. There are a number of deleted scenes from Jacob's Ladder floating around & having seen some of them they're worth tracking down although I'm not sure I'd put them back in the film especially Jacob's final confrontation with Jezebel.With a supposed budget of about $25,000,000 all I can say is where did all the money go? Seriously that just sounds like a huge amount of money for what ended up on screen, it's well made for sure but there's no big 'name' actors in it, no big special effects scenes & not that many locations either. The acting is uniformly excellent especially from Robbins who makes this film what it is.Jacob's Ladder isn't for everyone that's for sure but if you like challenging films that make you think then you could do a lot worse than this & it's just that bit different. A dark psychological horror thriller that's well worth a watch.

Will the kid die? will the dad get his son killed? Will there be a happy ending?Spoiler No. No. Yes.The hero saves the day. The bad guys (girl) die. The marriage is saved. The kid pees his pants.The one thing that I remember most - having watched this movie three hours and honestly only remembering this one part with the most clarity and excitement was when Mel's character, Tom Mullen and the bad guy Gary Sinise's character, Jimmy Shaker are having a heated conversation. They're shouting like crazed mad men, people are shocked and waiting to hear who is going to win this battle -- then the gun goes off. For a moment and found myself (however irrationally) terrified that Jimmy had shot the kid. But of course that would interfere with the whole happy ending prospect, which I realized after like three seconds of true panic. To be honest I don't really recommend the movie. At times it is far too fast paced, and at others it is much too slow. It was like the film had been put together in such a short amount of time that no one knew what the hell they were doing. Or that they hired some TV show people and said Hey make this into a TV movie that we can put on the LMN.(Now of course this is a horrible insult. My mom watches the LMN and I make fun of her every time. I even went as far as giving the LMN a mean pet name Lame Movie Network. Of course it isn't that original, but you try making something terrible that makes sense out of LMN.)Mel's performance is stirring in a particularly long scene on a balcony after the shooting I described earlier and probably saves the movie from being a total waste of time. His character was the only one that touched me -- other than that poor kid who peed his pants. I actually thought that was the best thought of thing in the movie. Set aside the plot, the kid hears Jimmy's voice, recognizes it, pees his pants. Pure Gold. And I say this with all seriousness. After that kid peed his pants I nearly cried. He went and hid in his tent and I nearly cried. It was so sad and wonderfully convincing.End note.

So, under burning sun the convoy duly drags along a field roller across the dunes while the soundtrack is blaring unmistakeably recognizable music from 'Lawrence of Arabia'. Some of the training sequences brought to mind bits from Laurel and Hardy comedies.At times situations begin to reach a point of surrealism. The soldiers already fallen in battle follow along the crew as ghosts of different colors. The oldest and most experienced man in the crew starts to dress and act like a circus clown. The changes and surprises just keep coming.Watching the scene where John Lennon as soldier Gripweed gets killed in a German field has now an enormous effect for reasons easy to understand. As he sits there bleeding, faces the camera and says something like You know this would happen, it really makes an extra strong comment on violence now. Stronger than the writer, director or any other ever had in mind. For a thirty years old black comedy this movie still has an awful lot to say.

So, under burning sun the convoy duly drags along a field roller across the dunes while the soundtrack is blaring unmistakeably recognizable music from 'Lawrence of Arabia'. Some of the training sequences brought to mind bits from Laurel and Hardy comedies.At times situations begin to reach a point of surrealism. The soldiers already fallen in battle follow along the crew as ghosts of different colors. The oldest and most experienced man in the crew starts to dress and act like a circus clown. The changes and surprises just keep coming.Watching the scene where John Lennon as soldier Gripweed gets killed in a German field has now an enormous effect for reasons easy to understand. As he sits there bleeding, faces the camera and says something like You know this would happen, it really makes an extra strong comment on violence now. Stronger than the writer, director or any other ever had in mind. For a thirty years old black comedy this movie still has an awful lot to say.

Okay, the film's saving graces the overall design of the sets and costumes.

Benson's (and also James') space suits are very nicely done. They give off the distinct air of practicality, like a hyper-modern air force pressure suit, and also a sense of impersonality about them which becomes menacing with the addition of the dark face plated helmets. Adam and Alex's work-out gear, however, is very dated and it's also quite excruciating to watch their exercise routine. The ships aren't Star Wars Star Destroyers, but then they're not meant to be. The way I look at it, they were designed to look slightly other worldly and also practical. Benson's pod that he flies to Saturn 3 looks entirely functional and although it appears rather clunky and distinctly un-aerodynamic, it's worth remembering that in space there isn't any wind resistance so sleek lines aren't necessary. Unfortunately, because this was a full-sized prop for the actors to interact with the other ships do look like the models they are. Hector is a piece of design excellence. For a start, the actual costume is made from metal, instantly rendering the appearance of a real robot. The actual laboured gait and measured way of moving employed by the actor playing Hector (probably due to the considerable weight of the suit) is instrumental in convincing the viewer of his cybernetic credentials. What helps is that we see Hector being constructed and that can block out any ideas of the man in a suit mold, particularly in regards to the insertion of the brain tissue into (effectively) the torso of the costume. Finally, Harvey Keitel. His performance in this film is derided by many as being too over the top and hammy but I think that he actually saw the script for what it really was - eighty-odd minutes of comic-book fun. He had a ball with the Benson character and it's quite obvious that he knew he wasn't asked to do Shakespeare and play it straight. Kirk Douglas and Farrah Fawcett are a let down to be sure. It's evident that Kirk's entering his dotage and the idea of him being an action hero and hot stud when he's the same age as most of the audience's grandfathers is frankly ludicrous. And showing your sagging butt, Kirk? Should've kept those training suit bottoms on. Farrah does play Alex well when she's there to look good, but any semblance of the idea that she's a research scientist just doesn't compute. The film in itself is a bit of a hit and miss affair. It aims to be a sophisticated sci-fi thriller like Alien but the casting of Douglas and Fawcett certainly taint any idea of it being classed as a thriller. The music (what there is of it) is original, the direction so-so and the overall concept is there, but it fails to it the target spot on.

These three were an unbeatable combination, although Leone and Morricone did okay without Clint, and Clint did pretty well for himself after he left the team.

Due to this powerful reason, his early British work is sadly often forgotten despite of having an enormous importance in the development of his style and a quality sometimes as high as his American films. Of the films of that period, 1937's thriller Young and Innocent is a very special case, as despite being an excellent movie, it's often ignored as is overshadowed by the movies that were done before and after it the popular Sabotage (1936) and the classic The Lady Vanishes (1938). Nevertheless, Young and Innocent is an excellent thriller, that represents another step in the development of Hitchcock's favorite theme the innocent man on the run.One morning, writer Robert Tisdall (Derrick De Marney) is taking a walk along the seaside cliffs to clear his mind when he makes a gruesome discovery the dead body of actress Christine Clay (Pamela Carme) washes ashore. As he runs to call an ambulance he is seen by two young swimmers who begin to believe that he is the murderer and call the police. As he returns to the crime scene, Tisdall is arrested as a suspect and taken to the station; but while at first Tisdall is confident that it's all a mere misunderstanding, soon he finds himself in a predicament he had met Christine Clay and she left him a large sum in her will, giving him a motive to be the killer. Without any way to prove his innocence, he escapes in order to find the real killer and clear his name. On the run, he'll find Erica Burgoyne (Nova Pilbeam), a young woman who begins to believe him, even when she is the daughter of Col. Burgoyne (Percy Marmont), the man in charge to find him.Written by Hitchcock regular collaborator Charles Bennett (with Edwin Greenwood and Anthony Armstrong), the movie is very loosely based on A Shilling for Candles, one of the Alan Grant series of novels by Josephine Tey. The adaptation is not faithful, as what happened was that the writers took only the chapters where Tisdall is a fugitive and built their movie from that (it doesn't even include Tey's signature character, Inspector Alan Grant). What is left, is a similar story to The 39 Steps (also penned by Bennett), but where the romantic comedy elements and the relationship between the couple get a more prominent role than the adventure and suspense of the previous classic. The dynamics between the characters is what sets this movie apart, as the main characters have remarkably well developed and have some nice jabs at some screwball comedy during the movie that gives it a charming tone.As written above, Young and Innocent is essentially a thriller on the vein of The 39 Steps, but while the tone of this story is considerably lighter, the Master manages to shows off his dominion of suspense through the film. Brilliantly using the excellent cinematography by Bernard Knowles, Hitchcock creates some of his best shot scenes among his British work, with a very clever uses of camera-work and miniatures that make this movie one of his most visually pleasing films. However, Hitchcock knew that in this story the characters were the star, so while many of his camera tricks shine through the movie, he never lets the visual effects to overshadow his actors, and keeps an excellent balance between the action sequences and the dialog-ridden scenes. While it certainly feels a tad unpolished when compared to other movies from that period, it has plenty of that special something that can only be described as Hitchcocknian magic.In a film like this, based entirely around the personalities of the characters, the performances by the cast are a key factor in the success of the movie, and fortunately this cast doesn't disappoint. Derrick De Marney is quite effective as our innocent man on the run, Robert Tisdall, delivering his lines with a charming wit that forecasts the characters that Jimmy Stewart and Cary Grant would play years later. However, who really shines in the movie is the beautiful Nova Pilbeam, as Tisdall's unwilling partner in crime, Erica Burgoyne. Previously seen in Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much, Pilbeam shows off her natural talent in one truly remarkable performance. Edward Rigby has a small yet quite funny role in the film, and he makes an extraordinary display of his talent for comedy. The supporting cast is good too, and includes nice performances by well-known actors Percy Marmont and Mary Clare.While in many ways this movie could be considered a minor gem in Hitchcock's career, it has enough interesting elements that make it an important movie. The film's blend of suspense and humor wasn't new to Hitchcock, who always liked to spiced up things in order to break the tension, but Young and Innocent took this one step forward and set the basis for many of the Master's future films. In fact, in many ways Young and Innocent could be seen as the companion piece to The 39 Steps, in the sense that many years later, Hitchcock would take elements from both in his masterpiece North by Northwest. As many critics have already pointed out, the witty figure of Derrick De Marney's role has a lot in common with Cary Grant's suave character from that movie. While definitely not a perfect movie, Young and Innocent is a nice movie to watch, as its charming wit never fails to be amusing. It certainly feels dated by today standards, but despite its old age, it still is a thrilling tale of adventure and comedy. Sadly neglected as a classic from this period, Young and Innocent is definitely as good as most Hitchcock films. Fans of Hitchcock should not miss this one. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 May 2007","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Whenever one thinks of Alfred Hitchcock films, it's almost impossible not to think about his famous Hollwood period where he directed a series of movies considered among the most important American films in history.

Then Neill does the foolish thing of leaving his wife on the yacht while the man rests below in a locked room, while he goes to investigate whatever happened on the other vessel. He's soon aware that something involving deliberate murder is what has happened to one of the poor victims, a dead woman whose body emerges from a container. On his way back to his own yacht, he sees the man has gotten out of the locked room and appears to be struggling with his wife.The suspense at this point goes into high gear.

It's an anti-message film, loaded with humor, with a most sublime message indeed.Joel McCrea plays director John Sullivan who's tired of making silly comedies and musicals for his studio. He wants to make films of social significance with a message about the troubles in today's world.Problem is that he doesn't know anything about poverty and unemployment, he's a rich kid who's been to boarding school. So off he sets, several times it turns out, to discover how the other half lives.That last time he sets out is a bit unplanned and through a combination of circumstances he winds up on a prison chain gang in some southern state. He learns some really profound lessons from that experience.But that's the serious side of Sullivan's Travels. Before that the film has some really gut splitting funny moments like McCrea learning about the speed of a whippet tank, being accused of stealing his own car. But my favorite is when he falls in the clutches of spinsters Elmira Sessions and Esther Howard. McCrea sets out to learn about poverty and deprivation and the two sisters see him as the answer to some poverty and deprivation they've been suffering for some time. Maybe the chain gang didn't look so bad.Veronica Lake in her memoirs said that one of the films she enjoyed most was Sullivan's Travels where she plays an disillusioned Hollywood hopeful who befriends the tramp McCrea without knowing who he really is. The following year Lake would be paired with Alan Ladd who was closer to her height. She said McCrea was a kind and decent man and wonderful to work with. The disparity of their height was the source of some amusement and some problems for Preston Sturges. Lake was a tiny thing, it was why she was teamed with Alan Ladd, and McCrea was well over six feet tall. Check the shots of them together, very rarely will you see them standing side by side.Sturges used a lot of his regular company of players. My two favorites in the supporting cast are Robert Grieg and Edward Blore who are McCrea's butler and valet. Both turn out to be wise men in their warnings to their boss about this folly he is undertaking.It's been said that Sullivan's Travels is supposed to be the anti-Frank Capra film about messages. I'm not sure Capra saw it that way. If you look at the portion of the film when Sullivan falls into this unfamiliar universe of the chain gang, it's very similar to what George Bailey was experiencing in that parallel universe he was sent to in It's A Wonderful Life.

McCrea sets out to learn about poverty and deprivation and the two sisters see him as the answer to some poverty and deprivation they've been suffering for some time. Maybe the chain gang didn't look so bad.Veronica Lake in her memoirs said that one of the films she enjoyed most was Sullivan's Travels where she plays an disillusioned Hollywood hopeful who befriends the tramp McCrea without knowing who he really is. The following year Lake would be paired with Alan Ladd who was closer to her height. She said McCrea was a kind and decent man and wonderful to work with. The disparity of their height was the source of some amusement and some problems for Preston Sturges. Lake was a tiny thing, it was why she was teamed with Alan Ladd, and McCrea was well over six feet tall. Check the shots of them together, very rarely will you see them standing side by side.Sturges used a lot of his regular company of players. My two favorites in the supporting cast are Robert Grieg and Edward Blore who are McCrea's butler and valet. Both turn out to be wise men in their warnings to their boss about this folly he is undertaking.It's been said that Sullivan's Travels is supposed to be the anti-Frank Capra film about messages. I'm not sure Capra saw it that way. If you look at the portion of the film when Sullivan falls into this unfamiliar universe of the chain gang, it's very similar to what George Bailey was experiencing in that parallel universe he was sent to in It's A Wonderful Life. I think Sturges and Capra would find a lot of common ground in the messages of It's A Wonderful Life and Sullivan's Travels.

In 1979, he released what is generally accepted as his second great masterpiece, 'Manhattan,' a poignant tribute to the city that Allen loves so dearly. Written by Allen and his 'Annie Hall'-collaborator Marshall Brickman, 'Manhattan' stars Allen as Isaac Davis, a twice-divorced, 42-year-old comedy writer who is intimately involved with a 17-year-old high school student, Tracy (an Oscar-nominated Mariel Hemingway). Meanwhile, Isaac begins to fall for Mary (Diane Keaton), who is the secret mistress of his best friend (Michael Murphy). Adding to all of Isaac's troubles, his former second wife, Jill (Meryl Streep), who had originally left him for another woman, has plans to write a tell-all book on their failed marriage.If this all seems very confusing to you, then you're not alone. Just as in 'Annie Hall,' Allen plays the hopeless romantic who is struggling desperately to understand the maddening complexity of human relationships. Though Tracy is only seventeen years old, she is arguably the most honest and mature of the women in Isaac's life; nonetheless, he doesn't treat her seriously. In his mind, anything that she says is quite obviously influenced by the naivety and downright ignorance of the young. Their relationship was never meant to be anything more than a brief fling, and so he feels no guilt for seeing another woman behind his back, an act that makes him livid when it ultimately happens to him.'Manhattan' was shot in beautiful crisp black-and-white by Gordon Willis, who has also worked on, among countless other films, 'Annie Hall' and the three installments of 'The Godfather.' The cinematography offers New York City a romantic 1940s feel, reminiscent of how Allen claims to remember the city as a child Maybe it's a reminiscence from old photographs, films, books and all that. But that's how I remember New York. I always heard Gershwin music with it, too. In 'Manhattan' I really think that we &#151; that's me and cinematographer Gordon Willis &#151; succeeded in showing the city. When you see it there on that big screen it's really decadent.Mysteriously, this film remains the least-liked by the director himself, though, at the same time, it was also his most commercially successful. As you've no doubt already noticed from this review, 'Manhattan' is often likened to 1977's 'Annie Hall,' perhaps due to the repeated casting of Allen and Keaton (a not uncommon occurrence) or its similar attempt to uncover the elusive secrets behind love and relationships. In terms of film-making style, however, the films are quite dissimilar. Unlike the highly-energetic 'Annie Hall' &#150; which cut back and forward in time, visited old memories, broke the fourth wall and made conversations with passing extras &#150; 'Manhattan' boasts a more classical approach &#150; quiet, softly-spoken and accompanied by a wistfully slow jazzy soundtrack, also relying heavily on the works of George Gershwin.

Holloway is great in the role, and his character is amusing, but his two songs - A Little Bit of Luck and I'm Getting Married in the Morning - go on way too long and add little to the story.Another problem I have with the film is the ending, which I'll not spoil, but I don't think it's really true to the characters or the way the story develops.My problems with the songs aside, My Fair Lady is such a gorgeous film that one is reluctant to criticize it.

Confidential, Body Heat can be regarded as an example of neo-noir, a film which uses modern cinema techniques while trying to capture the spirit of the classic films noirs from the forties and fifties. The plot- an unfaithful wife conspiring with her lover to murder her husband- was a noir staple, being used in Double Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice. Indeed, Body Heat is sometimes described as a remake of Double Indemnity- in my view inaccurately, as there are major differences between the plots of the two films. Although films noirs such as Double Indemnity frequently had plots which revolved around sexual passion, the moral climate of the forties and the Production Code meant that this had to be implied rather than shown explicitly on the screen. By the eighties the moral climate had become more liberal, which meant that neo-noir films could be far more explicit than their predecessors. Matty Walker, the unhappily-married younger wife of a wealthy and successful but unsympathetic Florida businessman, becomes involved with Ned Racine, a local lawyer, and they begin a passionate affair. (There are several love scenes between William Hurt and Kathleen Turner). They plot together to murder Matty's husband Edmund in order to inherit his money. Racine, as played by William Hurt, is arrogant, swaggering and cocky. He is ambitious but lazy, a man of both dubious competence and dubious ethical standards, who keeps equally dubious company. (His associates include Mickey Rourke's arsonist). He likes to think that he is always in control of the situation, but in reality he can be easily manipulated by Matty, a classic noir femme fatale. This was Kathleen Turner's first film, but she gives a remarkably assured performance as the glamorous and seductive Matty. (To be fair, Barbara Stanwyck was equally seductive in Double Indemnity- an even more remarkable performance when one considers that Stanwyck, unlike Turner, did not have the assistance of nudity or sex scenes). In the second half of the film, the plot becomes increasingly complex and difficult to follow; there is a particularly implausible final twist (which I will not reveal). Nevertheless, film noir is a genre in which atmosphere is often more important than plot (The Big Sleep is a good example). The same holds true for neo-noir, and Body Heat is a highly atmospheric film. The adjective steamy is often used metaphorically to mean sexually explicit, but this film can also be described as steamy in the literal sense. The title refers to the fact that Matty is said to have a natural body temperature of 100 Fahrenheit rather than the normal 98.4 (something which doubtless explains her sexual insatiability). It also refers to the fact that the action takes place during a heatwave. The atmosphere is one of extreme heat, of sweat, of physical lassitude, of moral decay and of sexual tension, an atmosphere heightened by John Barry's mournful and highly evocative jazz score. Many scenes take place at night, and director Lawrence Kasdan succeeds in giving these a look equivalent to the classic noir look. Instead of the moody black-and-white photography characteristic of noir, Kasdan uses in these scenes a colour scheme dominated by blacks, reds and oranges, something which emphasises the feelings of heat and passion. Body Heat was made in the same year as the Jack Nicholson\/Jessica Lange remake of The Postman Always Rings Twice, and the two films were often regarded as evidence of a trend in Hollywood towards a franker treatment of erotic subjects during this period. It seemed that the eighties were going to be the decade of the erotic thriller. That was not quite how things worked out in reality; the arrival of AIDS in the middle of the decade led to a revived moralism in the film industry so far as sex was concerned (although not necessarily so far as violence was concerned), and the levels of eroticism seen in Body Heat became the exception rather than the rule in the mainstream cinema. (There were a number of so-called erotic thrillers in the early nineties, most of which seemed to star either Tanya Roberts or Shannon Tweed, but these were films which concentrated much more upon erotica than they did on thrills, little more than softcore porn with a plot). The result is that Body Heat today seems as much of a period piece as Double Indemnity or The Big Sleep. It remains, nevertheless, an effective piece of cinema. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 May 2007","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Like Polanski's Chinatown from a few years earlier, or the more recent L.A.
