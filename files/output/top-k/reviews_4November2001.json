It such a great character driven movie with great writing, acting and directing.  I have wrote a little bit about why it's my favorite film ever.  Enjoy...                      Jerry MaguireCameron Crowe's `Jerry Maguire' is my favourite film and when I ask myself why I love it so much, I always come back to the same points1. Jerry Maguire is a good-hearted decent guy. 2. `Jerry Maguire' is film based purely on story, acting, writing and directing. 3. The film has heart and this movie is what movies should be about.1. One of the reasons is that Jerry Maguire is good-hearted decent guy. I have been thinking about why we should find this so amazing to see a good, decent guy.  I think it's because there is so few of them out there.  Jerry is a hard working guy who is taking the bad with the good.  He is trying to take his one client, Rod Tidwall and get his career back after being fired from his job at SMI.  At no point does Jerry give up.  There are many times when he had come close because he knew he was over.  But he didn't.  He fought and fought and in the end he succeeded.Jerry makes mistakes like we all do.  He messes up from time to time.  He's human.  It's these little touches that make us love the character Jerry Maguire and be able to relate to him.  Even if we have never been through what he has, we can still see his motivations for his actions and understand why he does what he does.Jerry Maguire's biggest problem is not being able to commit to a woman.  He's great at friendships but bad at relationships.  At the end of the movie when Jerry has success he realises that it's not all perfect because he cannot share it with the woman he loves.  Only after his hard work and he has now got success does he realise that he needs to have someone in his life to share his life with.When Jerry worked at SMI he was just, as Jerry says, `another shark in a suit', he was all about money.  He had a job; good money and he didn't really need to commit.  But Jerry's journey throughout the movie has made Jerry grow as a person and made him realise a few things.2. The movie is based purely on story, acting, writing and directing.  This movie doesn't rely on big explosions or effects to make this movie fun or interesting. All this movie has is a great script, actors and a great director.  I love, just like everyone else, now and again to go along and see a big Hollywood blockbuster full of guns, explosions and guys taking out entire army's with only a handgun.  Those movies are important because they allow you just to relax for a few hours and let your imagination go wild.  But these movies are not satisfying full-hearted movies like `Jerry Maguire'.  Those movies do not have the heart and soul that `Jerry Maguire' has.  Tom Cruise acts with such comic skill and is so natural.  He is so relaxed and confident in this role and it's obvious he is having lots of fun.  Cruise gives a great heart-felt performance, which is one of the best of his career to date.   Child actor Jonathan Lipnicki holds the screen with Cruise extremely well and it's a delight to see them share a scene together.  Renee Zellweger gives a fantastic performance as always delivering the lines with passion.The direction from Cameron Crowe is nothing short of amazing.  The atmosphere that the film has is so relaxed, funny and enjoyable.  He uses simple set ups to shoot the movie which works extremely well because there is no fancy shots which make you think `Wow look at that shot'.  He shoots it so subtly that at no point does it ever distract you from the story.3. The film has heart and this movie is what movies should be about.  It is clear that Cameron Crowe made this movie with passion and a real story to tell.  These kinds of movies do not come along very often.  This movie is the kind of movie that could have been made on a much lower budget and still have succeeded because the movie has heart.  It has a story to tell.  As I have said before, I like to see action movies now and again too, but movies like `Jerry Maguire' are what you call real movies.  The film industry today is treated too much like a business and too many filmmakers make movies for money and not because they have a passion for it.

He messes up from time to time.  He's human.  It's these little touches that make us love the character Jerry Maguire and be able to relate to him.  Even if we have never been through what he has, we can still see his motivations for his actions and understand why he does what he does.Jerry Maguire's biggest problem is not being able to commit to a woman.  He's great at friendships but bad at relationships.  At the end of the movie when Jerry has success he realises that it's not all perfect because he cannot share it with the woman he loves.  Only after his hard work and he has now got success does he realise that he needs to have someone in his life to share his life with.When Jerry worked at SMI he was just, as Jerry says, `another shark in a suit', he was all about money.  He had a job; good money and he didn't really need to commit.  But Jerry's journey throughout the movie has made Jerry grow as a person and made him realise a few things.2. The movie is based purely on story, acting, writing and directing.  This movie doesn't rely on big explosions or effects to make this movie fun or interesting. All this movie has is a great script, actors and a great director.  I love, just like everyone else, now and again to go along and see a big Hollywood blockbuster full of guns, explosions and guys taking out entire army's with only a handgun.  Those movies are important because they allow you just to relax for a few hours and let your imagination go wild.  But these movies are not satisfying full-hearted movies like `Jerry Maguire'.  Those movies do not have the heart and soul that `Jerry Maguire' has.  Tom Cruise acts with such comic skill and is so natural.  He is so relaxed and confident in this role and it's obvious he is having lots of fun.  Cruise gives a great heart-felt performance, which is one of the best of his career to date.   Child actor Jonathan Lipnicki holds the screen with Cruise extremely well and it's a delight to see them share a scene together.  Renee Zellweger gives a fantastic performance as always delivering the lines with passion.The direction from Cameron Crowe is nothing short of amazing.  The atmosphere that the film has is so relaxed, funny and enjoyable.  He uses simple set ups to shoot the movie which works extremely well because there is no fancy shots which make you think `Wow look at that shot'.  He shoots it so subtly that at no point does it ever distract you from the story.3. The film has heart and this movie is what movies should be about.  It is clear that Cameron Crowe made this movie with passion and a real story to tell.  These kinds of movies do not come along very often.  This movie is the kind of movie that could have been made on a much lower budget and still have succeeded because the movie has heart.  It has a story to tell.  As I have said before, I like to see action movies now and again too, but movies like `Jerry Maguire' are what you call real movies.

It was made with a modest budget of $23m it grossed a nice sum of $53m in the US.  It was in the UK, however, where the film really shone, up against the massive epic Gladiator at the time the movie managed to gross a none too bad £11m but what made it better was it was a true sleeper hit, it spent 14 weeks in the UK film charts. With no big name actors, and no major publicity the film did so well because of word of mouth and the word was it was damn good.I admit I was sceptical at first in reading about Final Destination.  It seemed like a tired teen horror movie that seemed to be spewing out of America at that time, indeed it was only until about 3 weeks in to it being released that I actually lifted my bum off my sofa and put my bum on the seat in front of the big screen to actually watch the movie.  I loved it, and it was made better by the low expectations I had of it.  It isn't groundbreaking but it is effectively chilly at times, the acting is surprisingly good and the plot is pretty fresh.James Wong (X Files) came up with the idea of the movie, about cheating death, and it does seem to have a kind of X Files ring to it.  The story goes as follows.  Alex (Devon Sawa) is off, with his classmates, to France. Now being in America France is like our version of&#133;America, so it's a pretty big deal.  While on the plane he has a premonition of the plane exploding, slightly scared, he wakes up and finds that some of his premonition turns out real.  Scared for his life, and the others on the plane, he cause a fuss which sees him and several other classmates chucked off the plane.  Some of his companions are none too pleased&#133;until they see Flight 180 blow up, killing everyone on the plane.Thus begins the cat and mouse chase by Death himself.  One by one, in seemingly &#145;accidental' ways, the survivors of the ill-fated crash are dying. While others dismiss the idea of Death coming for revenge, Alex isn't going to let it go and soon he convinces friend Clear (Ali Larter) that it is up to them to try and stop Death himself.As this happens we can witness some of the most imaginative death scenes ever.  Thanks to the movie not having a masked killer doing the rounds the death scenes are not limited to the &#145;knife in back\/stomach\/head\/eye' routine.  Indeed, the first death scene is both funny and horrific all in one because, like with many of the deaths in this movie, it can really seem as that can actually happen.  It gives you something to think about.The special effects, for a movie with as small as budget as this, are excellent (apparently they did actually spend half of their budget in the SFX).  The plane crash is one of the most realistic you will see, its worrying to watch.For a movie aimed at the teenager end of the market, and for a genre renowned for hammy acting, the people in this movie actually do a good job.Devon Sawa, no stranger to movies, is perfect at playing the lead role of the troubled Alex.  Kerr Smith (Dawson's Creek) does a major turnaround from what you are used to seeing him as, this time he's the typical school jock, flash car, blonde girlfriend, bad temper, but luckily he doesn't play it into overkill.  Another nice surprise is Sean William Scott (American Pie, Road Trip, Too many teen movies), while we are used to seeing him as the guy who cracks jokes and makes fun of the others, he plays the geeky guy this time, and he provides us with quite a bit of comic relief.  We also have a nice cameo of Tony Todd (aka the Candyman) as Bludworth, who plays the man at the morgue, he is suitably chilling, and is set to play a larger part in the sequel.Suspense wise this film doesn't fail either.  In many films like this you are guessing who will be killed next.  Not so in this movie.  You are actually told who is going to meet Death next.  However this doesn't spoil it.  Suspense is carried over by how the person will die.  If you know a person is going to die as soon as the camera pans of them, and their all alone, then your waiting in anticipation for them to die, but there are many false scares along the way.  Also the suspense is kept up throughout the movie, it doesn't seem to drag too much at any time.There are very few bad points to the movie.  Obviously it will depend on your taste whether you like it or not, whether you consider it too &#145;teeny' or too teeny but just right anyway.  This film does have fun as well as generate scares.It is worth noting that there is an alternate ending to the movie and quite a few deleted scenes, namely a main subplot where Clear becomes pregnant. I think that it was wise to omit these parts, the ending seemed cheesy, but the one we are left with is excellent.Final Destination, thanks to an imaginative story, nice acting and some elaborate death scenes breathes new life into the tired genre of teen horror.  It is not as widely recognized as the Scream trilogy, but in many respects it's better.

It was in the UK, however, where the film really shone, up against the massive epic Gladiator at the time the movie managed to gross a none too bad £11m but what made it better was it was a true sleeper hit, it spent 14 weeks in the UK film charts. With no big name actors, and no major publicity the film did so well because of word of mouth and the word was it was damn good.I admit I was sceptical at first in reading about Final Destination.  It seemed like a tired teen horror movie that seemed to be spewing out of America at that time, indeed it was only until about 3 weeks in to it being released that I actually lifted my bum off my sofa and put my bum on the seat in front of the big screen to actually watch the movie.  I loved it, and it was made better by the low expectations I had of it.  It isn't groundbreaking but it is effectively chilly at times, the acting is surprisingly good and the plot is pretty fresh.James Wong (X Files) came up with the idea of the movie, about cheating death, and it does seem to have a kind of X Files ring to it.  The story goes as follows.  Alex (Devon Sawa) is off, with his classmates, to France. Now being in America France is like our version of&#133;America, so it's a pretty big deal.  While on the plane he has a premonition of the plane exploding, slightly scared, he wakes up and finds that some of his premonition turns out real.  Scared for his life, and the others on the plane, he cause a fuss which sees him and several other classmates chucked off the plane.  Some of his companions are none too pleased&#133;until they see Flight 180 blow up, killing everyone on the plane.Thus begins the cat and mouse chase by Death himself.  One by one, in seemingly &#145;accidental' ways, the survivors of the ill-fated crash are dying. While others dismiss the idea of Death coming for revenge, Alex isn't going to let it go and soon he convinces friend Clear (Ali Larter) that it is up to them to try and stop Death himself.As this happens we can witness some of the most imaginative death scenes ever.  Thanks to the movie not having a masked killer doing the rounds the death scenes are not limited to the &#145;knife in back\/stomach\/head\/eye' routine.  Indeed, the first death scene is both funny and horrific all in one because, like with many of the deaths in this movie, it can really seem as that can actually happen.  It gives you something to think about.The special effects, for a movie with as small as budget as this, are excellent (apparently they did actually spend half of their budget in the SFX).  The plane crash is one of the most realistic you will see, its worrying to watch.For a movie aimed at the teenager end of the market, and for a genre renowned for hammy acting, the people in this movie actually do a good job.Devon Sawa, no stranger to movies, is perfect at playing the lead role of the troubled Alex.  Kerr Smith (Dawson's Creek) does a major turnaround from what you are used to seeing him as, this time he's the typical school jock, flash car, blonde girlfriend, bad temper, but luckily he doesn't play it into overkill.  Another nice surprise is Sean William Scott (American Pie, Road Trip, Too many teen movies), while we are used to seeing him as the guy who cracks jokes and makes fun of the others, he plays the geeky guy this time, and he provides us with quite a bit of comic relief.  We also have a nice cameo of Tony Todd (aka the Candyman) as Bludworth, who plays the man at the morgue, he is suitably chilling, and is set to play a larger part in the sequel.Suspense wise this film doesn't fail either.  In many films like this you are guessing who will be killed next.  Not so in this movie.  You are actually told who is going to meet Death next.  However this doesn't spoil it.  Suspense is carried over by how the person will die.  If you know a person is going to die as soon as the camera pans of them, and their all alone, then your waiting in anticipation for them to die, but there are many false scares along the way.  Also the suspense is kept up throughout the movie, it doesn't seem to drag too much at any time.There are very few bad points to the movie.  Obviously it will depend on your taste whether you like it or not, whether you consider it too &#145;teeny' or too teeny but just right anyway.  This film does have fun as well as generate scares.It is worth noting that there is an alternate ending to the movie and quite a few deleted scenes, namely a main subplot where Clear becomes pregnant. I think that it was wise to omit these parts, the ending seemed cheesy, but the one we are left with is excellent.Final Destination, thanks to an imaginative story, nice acting and some elaborate death scenes breathes new life into the tired genre of teen horror.  It is not as widely recognized as the Scream trilogy, but in many respects it's better. Lets hope the sequel maintains the high standard it has set.FINAL DESTINATION ISDifferent  Nicely acted   Filled with imaginative deathsFINAL DESTINATION IS NOTLow on suspense  A typical teen horror   Going to be shown as in-flight entertainment  ","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"4 November 2001","score":"70 out of 86 people found the following review useful","review":"  Final Destination, or &#145;Flight 180' as it was titled right up until the last minute, was a surprise hit of 2000.

While viewing the film at a local theater, I couldn't help but notice how well the plot flowed. To say the least, it was very linear, yet unpredictable at the same time. There were no annoying sub-plots taking over the story, the cast was supreme with top-notch acting and the thrills came not from blood-soaked violence, (The Score is probably the least violent heist movie I've seen in a long time, furthermore making it wonderful to watch)but from the intellectual turning points of each of the characters.

He wants De Niro to steal a scepter from a museum, where it's been hidden in a...... well I'm not going to actually give it away. It's your job to see the movie first.

You know a film is good when it's not slapped with some completely incomprehensible violence\/gore, which is why The Score is excellent. Even though the F-word is uttered quite a bit, I can't quite see what the heck kept this movie from getting a PG-13 rating. Some people in the MPAA are just paranoid I guess. But honestly, there is no violent content in the movie that deviates greatly from the story-line, (or no violent content AT ALL for that matter) which puzzles me further about its rating.      To end off my review, I must say that The Score is a brilliant piece of film-making and that the director and cast should all deserve Oscars for their engrossing performances.

After seeing the film, I noticed  some of the contents of the trailer never made it to the film's final cut.  A  shame.  They were some of the interesting plot elements that went missing. The  actors are a great line-up and do great work.  The plot is a very interesting  concept and the first time I'd ever seen it. The failure was in taking that concept, one that should have been wonderfully  psychological, and turning it into an action movie that tries to follow up on the  likes of Aliens.**SPOILER ALERT FOR CONTENT BELOW THESE LINES** The back-story, the scientists' experiments and Sil's quick maturity into her  adult form are all interesting and thrilling, though rushed and not given nearly  enough development time.  Sil's dream sequences were one of the places this film  shined.  They were stylish and very revealing into the psychology of this tortured  and instinctively driven main character\/antagonist\/creature.  It is too bad that  the film's creators chose to pursue their own blind instincts and rush into the  action genre. Instead of resolving character conflicts (Ben Kingsley's character  clearly expresses remorse for his role in abusing Sil, leading to her escape, yet there is zero development of the relationship between them - and it ends rather  abusively to the characters) or even allowing Sil to grow-up psychologically  (despite actually meeting the only nice guy in LA) the film-makers turned to a  cliche of hunt down and kill the monster with a lame it's not dead yet ending  (the rat - how lame). Overall, a massive disappointment to those of us that were looking forward to a  thrilling science fiction movie with intelligent undertones.  Though I hear the  guts and blood action movie lovers were thrilled... Has Species II attempted to take more of a psychological approach?  Doubt it,  though there appeared to be actual character interaction between Sil II and the  woman scientist in a brief glimpse on the Sci-Fi Channel... maybe I'll give it a  shot some day...
