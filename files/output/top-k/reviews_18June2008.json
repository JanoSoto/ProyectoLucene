(As Michael succinctly puts it, No redneck is this clever!) The masterstroke of the film is that you never actually see what's menacing them; everything is implied, and there's no terror worse than that of the unknown. If you can wade through the tedious arguing--and the shaky, motion-sickness-inducing camera-work--you'll be rewarded with an oppressively sinister atmosphere and one of the most frightening denouements in horror-film history.

There Dan works as a caring doctor while Herbert continues with his experiments on re-animating the dead using all manner of body parts stolen from the Hospital. Dan is uninterested in helping him until Herbert finds Dan's dead girlfriend Megan's heart, Herbert convinces Dan to help him build an entirely new body around Megan's heart & re-animate it in order to create a new life to which he agrees. Meanwhile the police are suspicious of them & Herbert's old nemesis Dr. Carl Hill (David Hill) is back & wants revenge...Co-written, produced & directed by Brian Yuzna I remember watching this in the early 90's here in the UK where it was retitled to Re-Animator 2 & I loved it then & I still love it now. The sequel to Stuart Gordon's wonderful Re-Animator (1985) this had a lot to live up to & I think it does a great job at being sufficiently different & taking the story & character's in another direction yet still undeniably remaining a Re-Animator film & keeping the core ingredients which made the original the cult classic it is today. The script by Yuzna, Woody Keith & Rick Fry is basically just a modern retelling of Bride of Frakenstein (1935) the Re-Animator way with added gore, buckets of blood & West as a modern day scientific Frankenstein. Herbert West is still the cold manipulative singled minded scientist that he was in the original, Dan is still the one with the humanity & there are some well written scenes of West emotionally blackmailing Dan into helping him. I would say the character's are actually slightly better here, also returning is Dr. Hill but just as a decapitated head here which leads to some fun scenes. The film has a good pace & it doesn't feel like a near 100 minute film, there are some decent subplots like the the police investigation as well as leftovers from the original like the zombies from the end of that make a reappearance here. Anyway, how can you not love a film that features a living decapitated head with Bat wings surgically grafted onto it's side which lets it fly around!?Besides a good solid story that is often surprisingly well written & played what makes Bride of Re-Animator so much fun are the outstanding gore & special effects. The makers really go to town & let their imaginations run riot, there are no less than five separate Special Make-Up Effects By credits during the opening. From a bizarre little creature made up of four fingers stuck together with an eyeball on top to a lower leg & lower arm fused together to all sorts of weird creations made up of various body-parts to some truly impressive anatomically correct gore effects like cut off arms, severed feet, spinal columns, intestines, all manner of body parts, someones chest cut open & prised apart, the 'bride' as seen in various stages of development on the operating table including a great scene where West grabs the exposed tendons in the cadavers wrist pulling on them & making the fist clench, decapitated heads, cut open Bats, huge amounts of blood splatter & the climatic scenes at the end when the bride literally tears herself apart pulling her still beating heart out, her body ripping in half & her head tearing off her body. The special effects are of a very high standard (I watched this last night on an anamorphic DVD & the autopsy cadaver on Dr. Grave's table for instance has so much fine detail like the veins, the muscles & organs) & are a lot of fun for those with the stomach.Technically the film is pretty good, I liked the slightly reworked score & the special effects are generally very impressive but it does look a little cheap at times. There are times when Yuzna gets it just right, I love the little bit when Dr. Graves says 'who would want to steal body parts' & then it cuts to Herbert West cautiously poking his head around a door looking to do just that. The cast are good, Jeffrey Combs is one of my favourite genre actor's & I think he's terrific in this, Abbott puts in a good performance, David Gale is only ever seen as a decapitated head but has fun while Argentinian born Fabiana Udenio provides the love interest.Bride of Re-Animator is a film I have always had a soft spot for, I love the modern reworking of a very Gothic Frankenstein type story (if your going to steal, steal from the best), I love the blood gore & outrageous special effects & creatures & there's a good solid cast here too. What more do you want? Anyone with a slightly macabre & twisted sense of humour should like it. Followed by Beyond Re-Animator (2003) which is also well worth a watch & IMDb lists House of Re-Animator (2008) in production in which West is summoned to the White House to re-animate the President played by William H.

I know I have to think of the context and of film-making at the time, but I honestly think that Potemkin could have done without a lot of film we see.So, anyway, we start out on a ship where the soldiers are maltreated by pompous officers who order them to eat maggot infested meat. This is shaping up well. They refuse to eat the soup made with the meat (so good so far), which ticks off the officers, most of whom have pointy waxed mustaches that they twirl with malice. The portly captain orders all hands on deck and proceeds to inform those who did not eat the soup that he will kill them all. This gave me pause.

As directed by Ted Demme, the film is vibrantly entertaining, painstakingly authentic... and utterly aimless in terms of overall purpose. We can't sympathize with Jung's meteoric rise to wealth and the wild life, and Demme isn't suggesting that we should idolize a drug dealer. So what, exactly, is the point of Blow? Simply, it seems, to present Jung's story as the epitome of the coke-driven glory days, and to suggest, ever so subtly, that Jung isn't such a bad guy, after all. Anyone curious about his lifestyle will find this film amazing, and there's plenty of humor mixed with the constant threat of violence and paranoid anxiety. Demme has also populated the film with a fantastic supporting cast (although Penélope Cruz grows tiresome as Jung's hedonistic wife), and this is certainly a compelling look at the other side of Traffic. Still, one wishes that Blow had a more viable reason for being; like a wild party, it leaves you with a hangover and a vague feeling of regret. ","genre":"Biography, Crime, Drama"}]
