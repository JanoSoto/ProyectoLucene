At this point is when Ana and Otto begin to sleep together (they begin to have a sexual relationship).The two live very happy because they are together.  However, things change for Otto because of his mother's death.  He decides to leave everything and everyone behind.  He becomes a pilot for a mailing service. Ana,too,decides to leave everything and leaves to go and live in Lapland, Finland.  Otto and Ana end up meeting here.The film was full of twists and turns.

I am not a deep thinker, and so do not have that many deep thoughts about this movie.  Natural Born Killers, Star Wars, 4 and anything by Kubrick cause me to have naturally deep thoughts.  I liked the fourth episode, simply because of the story. I am 17, and therefore, am jaded to technologies.  I thought that this movie had the technologies, but lacked anything else.I was bored by this movie.  It seemed longer than Titanic.  I thought that the whole movie would end with the pod race.  The effects were the best thing about this movie, and in my opinion, Lucas indulged himself with them. He is much like Joel Schumacher making Batman and Robin.  They are both fasciated with what they can do with technologies, sets, and effects. Lucas puts everything into the effects and forgets that he is making atwo hour movie until at least 90 minutes into it.I enjoyed the pod race, simply because I thought that the snipers were hilarious.  Uh Oh another problem.  The war at the end was visually breathtaking, but essentially mind-numbing.  The droids were boring, and they did not kill off the one character that really needed it, Jar Jar.  I think that if they killed him off, the kids would have cried, but every ingle guy over the age of 13 would have stood up and cheered.  That scene would have gotten a standing ovation.  The fight scene was very cool.The Phantom Menace seems to refer to Ani, much like Luke was A new hope. So, the story remains the same.  The only defense is that all wars are essentially the same, and so history is repeating itself.  Or, if you want to get technical, repeated itself already.  In the next one, I think Ani will find out his father really is Darth sidious, and Obi-Wan will be frozen.  He will also find out that the Queen is really his sister.  In other words, this movie is exactly the same as the old one, except that a Darth dies in this one.  The story, therefore, moved really slowly until it stood still.  This movie lacked any real soul, or imagination.  The fourth episode was all heart and you actually rooted for the good guy.  It was a tale that we all could relate to. We did not nor were not able to relate to this story until Anakin left his mother, and that was about the only point that we could.  It was cold, and sterile.So, in other words, see this movie in the biggest screen that the theater has, and maked sure that it is THXed because the only good part is the sound and big effects.  I do not think it would look the same on a small screen. I would really hate the movie then.  I think Lucas should have tried a little harder with this one.

Lina, the beautiful naive daughter of a general falls for a handsome feckless Lagonda driving bounder called Johnny, who, against his better judgment, falls for her too. They elope and marry, and set up house in a pretty Georgian country house in Surrey, but soon Lina starts suspecting Johnny guilty of crimes ranging from embezzlement to murder. Finally she becomes convinced he is out to murder her.Despite the dark plot, in appearance this is a relentlessly sunny movie. It was made in 1941, but there is no war on. The setting is an idyllic Hollywood English countryside of Tudor buildings, lovely gardens, Hunt Balls, elegant people, polite servants and  and continuous fine weather. Even Lina's suspected murder scene is the blinding white chalk cliffs of the English Channel. The darkness is confined to Lina's thoughts. Her fear stems from her helplessness. She has left the benign control of one man, her father, for an equally dependent relationship with another, whose intentions are far less certain. Why she is so ready to assume the worst of Johnny, after so many of her earlier fears prove groundless, is an interesting question. Is it subliminal revolt? Is she saying even Cary Grant can't make he a real woman? Alma Reville (Mrs Hitchcock) had a part in the script, it seems.Your correspondent saw this movie once before, many years ago, and remembered two things, the sunny rooms and the shot of the Lagonda's speedo as Johnny, with Lina in the passenger's seat, drives along the cliff top road at a reckless speed. Suddenly, seeing the dial ('50mph'), you are in there with Lina, feeling her fear and helplessness. All done, of course with minimal resources.Well, to a point. He may have regarded actors as cattle, but Hitchcock was obsessively careful in casting, especially with his female protagonists, and in Joan Fontaine as Lina, he found the perfect elegant vulnerable beauty who shines though the picture. Cary Grant was always much the same as an actor but was good at alternating between sunny and dark moods. He was perfect for the ambiguous Johnny. The rest of the cast are stock but superior 1940s English Hollywood - Cedric Hardwicke, Mary Whitty (as Lina's parents) and Nigel Bruce, stealing a few scenes as Johnny's pal Beaky. Hitch even got the car right. Pre-war Jaguars, fast, shoddy and cheap, were associated with cads in general and co-respondents (third parties in divorce actions) in particular. Johnny however is a superior class of cad and of course drives a Lagonda, a superior cad's car. Solid sporty types (like James Bond) drove Bentleys, at least before the war.Despite the studio sets, this movie holds up very well after 60 years. The ending is apparently different from Before the Fact by Francis Iles, the book it was based on, as the studio thought the original too strong. I haven't read it but I imagine that in the book Johnny, innocent to the last, plunges over the cliff in a grand suicidal gesture (no doubt heavily insured.) The production code prevented the depiction of suicide, at least for financial gain. But it's worth watching - for the suspense, for Joan Fontaine's luminous performance, and that drive along the cliff top.

Lina, the beautiful naive daughter of a general falls for a handsome feckless Lagonda driving bounder called Johnny, who, against his better judgment, falls for her too. They elope and marry, and set up house in a pretty Georgian country house in Surrey, but soon Lina starts suspecting Johnny guilty of crimes ranging from embezzlement to murder. Finally she becomes convinced he is out to murder her.Despite the dark plot, in appearance this is a relentlessly sunny movie. It was made in 1941, but there is no war on. The setting is an idyllic Hollywood English countryside of Tudor buildings, lovely gardens, Hunt Balls, elegant people, polite servants and  and continuous fine weather. Even Lina's suspected murder scene is the blinding white chalk cliffs of the English Channel. The darkness is confined to Lina's thoughts. Her fear stems from her helplessness. She has left the benign control of one man, her father, for an equally dependent relationship with another, whose intentions are far less certain. Why she is so ready to assume the worst of Johnny, after so many of her earlier fears prove groundless, is an interesting question. Is it subliminal revolt? Is she saying even Cary Grant can't make he a real woman? Alma Reville (Mrs Hitchcock) had a part in the script, it seems.Your correspondent saw this movie once before, many years ago, and remembered two things, the sunny rooms and the shot of the Lagonda's speedo as Johnny, with Lina in the passenger's seat, drives along the cliff top road at a reckless speed. Suddenly, seeing the dial ('50mph'), you are in there with Lina, feeling her fear and helplessness. All done, of course with minimal resources.Well, to a point. He may have regarded actors as cattle, but Hitchcock was obsessively careful in casting, especially with his female protagonists, and in Joan Fontaine as Lina, he found the perfect elegant vulnerable beauty who shines though the picture. Cary Grant was always much the same as an actor but was good at alternating between sunny and dark moods. He was perfect for the ambiguous Johnny. The rest of the cast are stock but superior 1940s English Hollywood - Cedric Hardwicke, Mary Whitty (as Lina's parents) and Nigel Bruce, stealing a few scenes as Johnny's pal Beaky. Hitch even got the car right. Pre-war Jaguars, fast, shoddy and cheap, were associated with cads in general and co-respondents (third parties in divorce actions) in particular. Johnny however is a superior class of cad and of course drives a Lagonda, a superior cad's car. Solid sporty types (like James Bond) drove Bentleys, at least before the war.Despite the studio sets, this movie holds up very well after 60 years. The ending is apparently different from Before the Fact by Francis Iles, the book it was based on, as the studio thought the original too strong. I haven't read it but I imagine that in the book Johnny, innocent to the last, plunges over the cliff in a grand suicidal gesture (no doubt heavily insured.) The production code prevented the depiction of suicide, at least for financial gain. But it's worth watching - for the suspense, for Joan Fontaine's luminous performance, and that drive along the cliff top.

I COULD NOT LOVE THIS FILM MORE!!! It literally had me on the edge of my seat for the total duration of the movie. Some say that the plot slowed down too much with the Anakin scenes and the Coruscant scenes. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is the action behind the action. It is much more fast and furious than the slowing-down of A New Hope. But, there is something I must say about the pace of this film that I will come to later.It is the least-simplistic plot of all the Star Wars movies. Some people say they were confused? Who are these people? Slack-jawed yocals? I guess these are the same people that would have trouble understanding the plot of Forrest Gump. For, although this the most complex plot of the Star Wars movies, it does not stray THAT far from the simplistic good-guy, bad-guy nature of the Star Wars films.The acting was dead perfect. Liam, Ewan, and Natalie definitely knew their stuff. I actually expected bad acting, but that's not what I got. ..now, let's talk about Anakin I didn't like his introduction. Well, I liked it, but it was too quick. It was rushed. And at first, I must admit I was a bit shaky about his acting. But, he came to grow on me. His acting wasn't bad at all. He acted his part just as perfectly as the other actors did. He acted like a nine year old boy. And, to tell you the truth, I really liked Jar Jar Binks! What a great new character! He was well-done in the script, but people were saying he stole the center of attention in the movie, so I was prepared for the worst. But I was proven wrong. And man, what a weird voice...cool but weird. PS My 16 year old sister is IN LOVE with Jar Jar and Anakin.I'm sorry to say this, I really am. I feel sad saying it, but.... The Phantom Menace is the best of the Star Wars films. And to tell you the truth, I honestly honestly didn't think it would be. The reviews made me think this was a ROTJ-level movie. And I LOVE TESB. I thought there was no way TPM would top TESB. I just didn't think it would. ....but it did. And do you know why? Because, in my honest opinion, TPM was more Star Wars-ish than the other Star Wars movies. There, I said it. Lucas has always said that Star wars is just Fantasy with technology. Star Wars is not sci-fi. And none of the Star Wars movies prove this better than TPM. A New Hope had this huge, planet-destroying space station. But, TPM has a beautiful planet, a majestic city, and a beautiful palace taken over by the villains. The Jedi Knights are real in this film. They aren't just some hokey religion with ancient weapons, they are total bad-asses. There isn't ONE BIG image in TPM like the Death Star, and that's what I liked about this film. It was about the plot. It was about the Palace. A planet taken over, a beautiful (and I do mean beautiful) Queen who must flee, a slave who must win his freeedom, and a FANTASTIC capital planet (the senate and Jedi Council scenes were AWESOME), and finally the return to the planet and the fight to take back the palace and defeat the armies of the Federation. A wonderful, magical, fantastical story. More endearing to me, than the story of a farm boy who destroys a space station.I cannot wait to see it again. When the movie ended, I really really wanted to get back in line and see it again. I am going to go see this movie as often as I can over the weeks to come. Like I said, there is just too much to absorb in two hours. Your eyes cannot digest it all. YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST see this movie more than once to see everything. And that is not necesarilly true with the other films. Sure, I saw the special editions multiple times at the theater, but I did that because I liked the movies so much.

Yes, this sounds like butt-kissing, but it isn't. My grandfather died in WWII, as did millions of your grandfathers, fathers and brothers. Until I saw SPR, I, like many others, had tucked the mere thought of war into a drawer in my mind titled ignore and it might go away. I am very much ashamed to admit I was one of those who complained that veterans should forget it and get on with their lives.  Now though, I can honestly say that this film has changed my life. What's more, anybody who denies that it changed theirs is either lying or devoid of humanity.Obviously, as anybody who has seen the film will know, the first twenty minutes at Omaha beach are overwhelmingly shocking, heartbreaking and soul numbing. I sat in my seat, emotionally paralysed and totally disbelieving. I put my popcorn on the floor and couldn't bring myself to touch it again. I know people say the plot was often thin and the film slow moving but surely they realise this is far more true to life than non stop action? There were weeks on end where soldiers did nothing but wait in the trenches, where the build- up to the finale was far more nerve racking than the action itself because you knew something had to happen, you just didn't know when. The film reflects this.

I know people say the plot was often thin and the film slow moving but surely they realise this is far more true to life than non stop action? There were weeks on end where soldiers did nothing but wait in the trenches, where the build- up to the finale was far more nerve racking than the action itself because you knew something had to happen, you just didn't know when.

Poor directing, poor acting, choppy editing, juvenile dialogue. It's as if they just let the camera roll with no cutting room time, and let the actors do what they wanted. I guess if you  get millions of bucks, there's really no problem with that, but if you're worried about risking your contract for other films, that's a whole other story.Who chose George Clooney to play the part? He does about as good of a job playing Batman as  Rodney Dangerfield would portraying  Elvis Presley. And Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl was a nauseating sight Zero acting ability, plastic face, and zilch intelligence!!! Uma Thurman was wasted as Poison Ivy; she had so much potential playing that part,  it was the storyboard and script that ruined that potential.
