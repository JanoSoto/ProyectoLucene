The guide-dog would not run after the other dog, they are specifically trained not to.Why don't the people in front of Clark notice the burning penguin or put it out and why doesn't Clark take his paper of the pile thats very visible.No bank guard would fire in a crowded street and the guy in the car had plenty of time to open a window\/door and get free.

He uses his employee number to hack into the company system. He's a data processor, he'd have little to limited system access. His terminal would be limited to the task he was doing and nothing else at that time. And any hack would be traced back to his employee number. Being a data processor certainly wouldn't involve a light-pen in any way. And it's unlikely the Webscoe system would accept commands typed in plain English.

And Gus hacking a weather computer would NOT effect a bank ATM, or Bloomingdales Billing Department, or traffic control (they are totally independent systems). Traffic lights are very basic circuits built into the light itself.Vulcan can only monitor weather, that's all it's designed for, it would never make weather. This is totally beyond belief, that a novice hacker could reprogram a weather monitor system to actually create weather.And Gus would have smashed right through the window he landed on when he fell down the building.

And more to the point how did Gus, who isn't even in Smallville find out? Superman knows Kryptonite is green, why didn't he suspect the gift from Gus right away? Why do Lana and Ricky live in such a big house? No wonder her rent costs so much.Superman blowing out the Olympic flame is no big deal, it could easily be re-lit when he left. Oil ship steering isn't computer controlled. They might get instructions by computer but they are steered by humans as the sea is too unpredictable.

How does Lex know the frequency he transmits on will be heard by Superman, he has no idea, again just conjecture. Why isn't there more rubble when Superman drills through the ground. The hide-out is deep so there should have been a lot of rubble as Superman would have to had dug very deep.Lex fluffs his line Why don't you do yourself a FLAVOUR and freeze. Good goof that. The hide-out wall would have collapsed before the door ever fell inwards.The missiles that Lex had tampered with would have both been checked over by technicians once arriving at their destinations. They would have discovered the alterations and changed them right back. So the missiles would never have gone off course.The earthquake creating Lex's new paradise would cause a tidal wave that would destroy everything that existed on that land. And put it underwater for a very long time, rendering it worthless, bankrupting Lex.Oh, and the missiles could both be manually destroyed from the control room they were fired from. Never once is that tried. Why doesn't Lois stop driving on the road, the most obvious thing to do. And Golden Gate Bridge wouldn't just snap like that if 1 or 2 cables broke.The train wouldn't have derailed at the speed it was going. And Superman doesn't know Olson's name but he called him Jim! Superman has no authority to deliver Lex to the prison, they have to be arrested by a policeman, go through a trial. Superman bypassed all that ignoring the American way completely.A generally weak ending.

Mixing caution with heavy-handedness, message movies pat themselves loudly on the back for daring to tackle major problems. CROSSFIRE is not entirely free from this taint; it includes a sermon on the nature of senseless hatred that is embarrassingly obvious, assuming a level of naivity in its audience that's depressing to contemplate. As late as 1947, it was a big deal for a movie to announce that anti-Semitism existed, and that it was bad. (It was unthinkable, of course, for Hollywood to address the real subject of the book on which the movie was based&#151;its victim was a homosexual.) Nevertheless, thanks to good writing and excellent acting, CROSSFIRE remains a persuasive examination of what we would now call a hate crime.Postwar malaise was one of the major components of film noir, and CROSSFIRE addresses it directly. The film is set in Washington, D.C. among soldiers still in uniform but idle, spending their days playing poker and bar-crawling. Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene), an intelligent and kindly Jew, explains that the end of the war has created a void all the energy that went into hating and fighting the enemy is now unfocused and bottled up. Samuels meets three soldiers in a bar the sensitive Mitchell, who is close to a nervous breakdown, the weak-willed Floyd Bowers, and Montgomery, a tall, overbearing bully who nastily belittles a young soldier from Tennessee as a stupid hillbilly. The three soldiers wind up at Samuels' apartment, where the drunken Monty becomes increasingly abusive, calling his host Jew-boy. Samuels is beaten to death, and Mitchell disappears, making himself the prime suspect for the killing.Unraveling the crime are Detective Finlay (Robert Young), dry and by-the-book, and Sergeant Keeley (Robert Mitchum), a thoughtful and experienced friend who knows Mitchell is incapable of murder. Among the pieces of the puzzle are Ginny (Gloria Grahame), a nightclub hostess who met Mitchell and gave him her apartment key, and Floyd (Steve Brodie), who as a witness to the crime holes up terrified in a seedy rooming house. While there is no real whodunit suspense, the story remains gripping, and the trap laid for the killer is extremely clever.The strong noir atmosphere saves the movie from feeling didactic or sanctimonious. The cinematography is a striking shadow-play, with inky darks and harsh lights, rooms often lit by a single lamp filtered by cigarette smoke. World-weariness is as pervasive as noir lighting. Nothing interests me, Finlay says quietly; To nothing, is Ginny's toast in the nightclub. Gloria Grahame, the paragon of noir femininity, nearly steals the movie with her two scenes. Platinum-blonde, jaded and caustic, she's the quintessential B-girl, poisoned by the stinking gin mill where she works (for laughs, she says bitterly), her sweet face curdling when Mitchell tells her that she reminds him of his wife. Now and then a wistful kindness peeks through her defensive shell, as when she dances with Mitchell in a deserted courtyard, then offers to cook him spaghetti at her apartment. When he goes there, he meets a weasely, crumple-faced man (Paul Kelly) who seems to sponge off Ginny, and whose conversation is a dense layering of lies and false confessions. Gloria blows Mitchell's good-girl wife off the screen in a scene where she's asked to give Mitchell an alibi. Slim and frail in her bathrobe, with her girlish lisp, she lets us see just how often Ginny has been insulted and dismissed as a tramp.Robert Young is a nondescript actor, and he stands no chance against Mitchum's charisma, but he does a good job of keeping his pipe-smoking character, saddled with delivering the movie's earnest message, this side of pompousness. Mitchum, meanwhile, gets some cool dialogue, but not nearly enough to do; still, even when he's doing nothing but lounging in a corner you can't take your eyes off him. The third Robert, Ryan, creates a fully shaded and frighteningly convincing portrait of an ignorant, unstable bigot; we see his phony geniality, his bullying, his resentment of anyone with advantages, his Am I right or am I right? smugness; how easily he slaps labels on people and what satisfaction he gets from despising them.CROSSFIRE's message seems cautious and dated now, though not nearly so much as the same year's A GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT. Finlay's speech about bigotry cops out by reaching back a hundred years for an instance of white victimhood, reminding us that Irish Catholics were once persecuted; next it could be people from Tennessee, he says, or men who wear striped neckties. Or maybe blacks, or Japanese, or homosexuals, or communists? The script seems afraid to mention any real contemporary problems. It sweetens its message by making the Jewish victim saintly, as though his innocence were not sufficient; and it takes care to exonerate the military, having a superior officer declare that the army is ashamed of men like Montgomery, and stressing that Samuels served honorably in the war. Still, it did take some guts to depict, immediately after World War II, an American who might have been happier in the Nazi army, and the movie's basic premise is still valid. If Monty were alive today, he would have gone out on September 12, 2001, and beat up a Sikh.

In the long, forgiving periods between viewings (should you be reckless enough to watch it more than once), this film may take on an aura of kitschy fun. You may remember the gaudy production design, the naff one-liners, the over-ripe performances, and assume that this film was a so-bad-it's-good classic. I know I made that mistake. Rewatching it was a sobering experience. I'd forgotten the one quality that is the kiss of death for kitsch - dullness. This is a shockingly boring film. By the climax, I was itching for it to be over, checking the clock with disbelief that Schumacher hadn't, in fact, imposed a Kenneth-Branagh's-Hamlet running time on this leaden production.People blame camp for ruining this film, but let's be specific - this is mass camp, and bad mass camp at that. Real camp is concerned with performance, subtle double meanings, irony that doesn't force itself upon you. Tim Burton's Batman films used camp elements quite extensively, particularly in the stylised performances of his cast; Schumacher doesn't seem to be able to distinguish camp (Uma Thurman emerging from a gorilla suit, a la Marlene Dietrich) and kitsch (everything else, particularly the queasily-lit sets).I have a feeling that, with better direction, Thurman might actually have been a lot of fun as Poison Ivy; unfortunately, Schumacher can only draw out the most grotesque elements of her performance, strangling some of her more finely done comic moments (and there are few enough of those). Clooney gives the most naturalistic performance, the only star whose acting could grace a better film, but unfortunately his easy charm is all wrong for the role. At least this film seemed to act as a kick up the backside for his career; his choices after this were much cannier. Michael Gough is as solid as always.Everyone else is irredeemably awful.

Clooney gives the most naturalistic performance, the only star whose acting could grace a better film, but unfortunately his easy charm is all wrong for the role.

The crimson trailer played and looked outstanding, the blood red film stock color and the ending with him, taking a shotgun out from the trunk of the car toward something, had me captivated.

The hyperactive exclamations of prepubescent Sean Astin ('Mikey'), Corey Feldman ('Mouth'), Jeff Cohen ('Chunk'), and Ke Huy Quan ('Data')--the 'Goonies' of the title--kind of grated on my nerves with their novice, kitchen-sink performances (even considering the usual excesses of child actors, this was pushing it). But just as I was beginning to think that, the movie kicked into gear and began its enthralling course--yes, even at 25 years of age, I can say without a hint of shame that I had a lot of fun with this kid-friendly Temple of Doom. Our titular characters live in an overcast seaside community, set to be razed by greedy land developers looking to put up a golf course. While messing around with the antiques in Mikey's attic, our boys stumble across a 17th-century treasure map, and decide to embark on a quest to find the (implied) riches contained within. In their travels, they also run afoul of the slapstick quartet of 'Ma' Frattelli (Ann Ramsey) and her three sons (Robert Davi and Memento's Joe Pantoliano), one of whom is a hideously deformed--but very humane--Charles Addams caricature. The Goonies also run into booby traps aplenty, and the story maintains a surprising amount of unpredictability, considering its target audience (while *mostly* a kid's movie, the material isn't inaccessible to older viewers).That being said, Steven Spielberg's story credit seems a bit dubious, especially when looking at The Goonies from a distance he could have very well approached Warners with 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,' only with kids instead of Harrison Ford! and collected his check on the way out. Whereas Indy, Willie, and Short Round altruistically braved peril to save the children of an impoverished Indian village, we have the Goonies altruistically banding together to save their threatened community.Of course, this would be bothersome...if The Goonies wasn't so much damn fun. Like the endearing classic Ghostbusters, The Goonies is a similar 1980s gem, with a sense of creativity, adventure, and humor (including some fine one-liners), with plenty of crossover appeal to individuals who claim to have 'outgrown' this sort of film.

Me being a typical action-junkie, I would not intentionally have set out to watch this movie. Although I do enjoy the occasional romantic comedy, the word drama and the fact that the movie is 36 years old would have been enough for me to avoid this one. However, during one late night in front of the TV zapping, I stumbled over the beginning of this movie and got hooked.I loved the lead characters and above all found the dialogue brilliant. I am not very good at analyzing actor performances and other aspects of the movie but judging from the Academy Award and nominations and the 709 other people that has given this movie a 10\/10 rating I would guess that I am not the only one to like the movie.Finally, I would not have lost any sleep if they had left out the part about Love means never having to say you're sorry. Nice Feel-good\/Break-your-heart movie.

As indicated by the title, the narrative is seen through the eyes of the sensitive young son of a working-class couple; the mother is having an affair and the boy is witness to - and the victim of - the inevitable disintegrating family ties, being bounced around from the household of one begrudging relative to another. The couple make a determined effort to stay together for the sake of the child (having to contend, besides, with the nosy and gossiping tenants of their condominium) - but the impetuous young man who has come between man and wife won't give her up so easily, and he finally manages to tear her from them for good.

The success of the first film is due to many factors, primarily Cameron's cinematically efficient illustration of a tight story that he fills with powerful and iconic imagery frequently interspersed with dark humor.Following an ominous credit sequence perfectly paired with Brad Fiedel's metallic 13\/8 score, the scene of the garbage truck and the dumpster immediately conveys Terminator's power and effect on its environment. Its flaming time-travel arrival, like the detonation of a nuclear blast, renders the truck useless and sends the terrified driver scurrying for cover (after uttering What the Hell-- the identical ADR soundbite looped from his previous interior cab shot).The three punks at the Griffith Observatory are perfectly rendered. While horsing around with a coin-op telescope, Brian Thompson's character spots the approaching muscle-bound, completely nude Terminator and wonders, What's wrong with this picture? Bill Paxton's tire-tread facial tattoo and sneering opener Nice night for a walk, and Brad Rearden's guffaw and arm tap response, are potent character details. In T2, we learn that the T101's cpu is set to read-only since he's out alone. However, the conclusion of this exchange seems to display its capability as a learning computer; Paxton's obscene three-word rebuke to the cyborg's clothing request was later included in the Termo-vision response choices to the flophouse janitor's query, You got a dead cat in there, or what? Arnold's flat Austrian-flavored delivery dynamically reinforces the reality of the machine beneath the rotting flesh, functioning as designed despite its chronically damaged exterior. The scene in the gun shop, the deadly conclusion of which is obvious from the worm's eye POV of Arnold's entrance, is another example of humor and violence. After handling the AR-180, the Franchi SPAS 12-gauge auto-loader (you can go pump, or auto), the 45 long slide with laser sighting (that's a good gun), the T101 requests a phased plasma rifle in a 40-watt range, to which the salesman matter-of-factly replies, Hey, just what you see, pal as if he had simply asked for an illegal weapon like a rocket launcher. Or as if a secret code word would avail him to the shop's special selection of weaponry a la the white supremacist's private cache in Falling Down.Rising from Kyle's first volley of blasts in the nightclub, he kicks his firepower up a notch as he unleashes the Uzi. His deliberate, here-it-comes lock'n'load is a choreographed ballet of impending destruction, as seen from Sarah's POV. After being blown back through the glass, he rises from the sidewalk and begins chasing Kyle and Sarah, his pace accelerating steadily just like a machine. Or a hyper-alloy combat chassis, tersely described by wheel-gripping, teeth-baring Reese as microprocessor controlled, fully armored, very tough. He then sums it all up for a dubious Sarah That Terminator is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead! Classic.The nonchalance with which the T101 smashes the window of the station wagon, gets in and slams the door, and sends glass flying into his hair and face, is comical in its depiction of Terminator as a cold machine. As he pulls up to the curb in front of the first Sarah Connor's house, the front tire stops on and partially crushes a blue toy truck. Arnold the destroyer. Chasing Kyle and Sarah in the tanker truck, his red eye can be seen glowing from behind the cab's darkened windshield. He absolutely will not stop!The overwhelming brutality of the Terminator is most clearly displayed in the police station I'll be back scenes. Easily wielding the AR-180 with his right hand and the infamous Franchi auto-loader with his left, he marches through the corridors wasting everyone he sees (17 in all), complete with a flanged Termo-vision braaaaap! across the wall after a fleeing cop. In Cameron's ever-increasing display of force and destruction, Terminator wraps up the massacre by taking out detective Vukovich with half a dozen automatic rounds AND a shotgun blast.You might notice during that police station sequence a scene where the T101, back to the camera, swings the 12-gauge up with his left hand. When he pulls the trigger, they foleyed in (twice) an automatic-rifle burst instead of a shotgun blast. Another continuity issue Reese saws off the stock of the shotgun and loudly racks it toward the camera. He wakes from the future-war nightmare in the car, and racks it again. No shell ejected? Then, in the night club, he whips it out from under his coat and does it one more time. Visual power trumps continuity.

Of the four main characters in this film (the MacManus brothers, Smecker, and Rocco), only one (Rocco) has any discernible motivation for what he ends up doing in the movie. It could be argued that the brothers are motivated by the sermon at the very beginning of the movie, where the priest intones against good men who are indifferent to evil (and they only hear the beginning of it). If that's the case, however, the brothers would have killed the Russian mobsters during the bar fight, rather than just setting Ivan's pants on fire. And they didn't kill Ivan and his buddy in the alley because they were out to rid the world of evil, they killed them in self-defense. As for Smecker, god only knows why he ends up wanting to help the brothers and their vigilantism. Bad day at the hairdressers, maybe? Defoe's performance can only be described in one word mannered. It is not easy to portray a character whose major personality trait is flamboyance, and Defoe just doesn't convince us that he's doing anything else but playing the role of an eccentric, self-loathing homosexual. At times, he verges on a parody of himself. Flanery and Reedus, for their parts, are about as two-dimensional as their characters.Duffy not only needs to learn about motivation, he needs help with plotting. For instance, the Russian mob leader tells someone who he thinks is Ivan about the big gangland meeting. The only problem is that Ivan's murder has been in every paper and news program in Boston -- it's the biggest story in town (that's why all those reporters are asking about the case when Smecker is interviewing the brothers). So, what's wrong with this guy? If he's such a great gang leader, why can't he pick up a newspaper? Who does he expect to show up after he invites a dead guy to his meeting? His stunt double? I suppose a couple of meat packers become expert assassins (that's never explained) because they picked up a few lessons from dad, but how do they go from killing nine guys with ten shots to exchanging hundreds of rounds with il Duce and missing him entirely? Furthermore, why exactly is il Duce such a feared hit-man when he can only wing three guys while unloading six handguns? It looks like he's only a danger to himself. And why is an Irishman (with a Scottish brogue) called il Duce anyway? In short, weak characterizations, hammy acting, unbelievable plot holes, a morally indefensible message -- there's a lot not to like about this film. One of the few redeeming features is that Ron Jeremy, for the most part, keeps his pants on throughout the movie.
