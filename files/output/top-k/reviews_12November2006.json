[{"date":"12 November 2006","score":"","review":" Gossip is a glossy, college-bound thriller with an attractive cast and a fast-moving script.The beautiful Lena Headey is very watchable as the female lead, Cathy Jones.The rest of the cast is also strong and it contains some familiar faces - James Marsden, Norman Reedus, Kate Hudson, Eric Bogosian and Edward James Olmos. With this smörgåsbord of talent, it's not surprising that this is an entertaining suspense-ride.I'd never heard of Gossip until I watched it (for me, Gossip was a blind-buy at the DVD bargain bin where it was practically being given away). It's not cinema-hit material but it does make a good evening's viewing at home.7 stars.
