Nowadays movies so often show the good characters early on put in certain circumstances (threatened, attacked, betrayed) in order to coerce us to respond to them. By contrast, this movie shows returning man going about his business, and each of the returning characters make the kind of small mistakes that make them more human, more approachable. More than in any other movie I felt I was meeting new friends rather than following a story. Yet the stories themselves are good. This movie is in my top 5. I found it similar to Its a Wonderful Life, which I love too, but less obvious and less overly dramatic. Other good things about the film -- you can learn about the 1940s dress, manner of speaking, sense of humor; the movie has more thoughtful dialogue than two average current movies; the cinematography is excellent, with especially thoughtful character positioning in group scenes; there's a cameo by Hoagy Carmichael.

Not that it is a bad thing to have so much happening in just a short amount of time, but with Grace of My Heart it felt like a solid blow to the gut. The lack of air, the whoosh of intense pain, and the increased blurred vision due to the excitement of the punch were all experiences that I had while watching this film. For those that can sit here and claim that this was a perfect film, I really beg to differ, but I will be a very brave advocate towards the originally average. This means that there were elements that I completely loved, followed in suit by elements that made me awaken at night in a pool of my own sweat. Grace of My Heart was one of those classic cinematic tug-o-wars that ultimately ended in a stalemate, but had fans on either side waiting for the final results.Beyond the cryptic comparisons that I make above, there were moments of honesty, especially when I was thinking about the elements that worked and those that did not. You cannot talk about this film without giving Anders the credit that she deserves for the music. This film could not have survived without the talent that was behind the musical moments. The energy, emotion, and cultural independence were ravishing. Literally, it could take your breath away and you wouldn't have even realized it. It set the tone and created the atmosphere for this film. As a viewer, you could close your eyes, ignore the spoken words of this film, and get completely lost in the music. The way that Anders incorporated established, modern singers to bring this era of the 50s, 60s, and 70s to life were brilliant. She deserved the accolades that followed the musical footsteps of this film, sadly &#133; I don't think she quite had a firm grip on the rest of the story.What I mean by this is that while the songs established the film, the story and characters hurt it. Illeana Douglas does exceptionally well with the material presented to her, but she just doesn't quite drag you into her life. You never quite feel as if you are right there with her experiencing her sorrows, excitements, and pain as she trudges through this man-infested life of hers. You watch her go through the motions, but you never feel that tear erupt or couch-excitement brew. It just doesn't happen, and why &#133; because 1) she never ages throughout the course of 20ish years (only gets thinner and thinner) 2) her voice is semi-whiney through the entire film causing us to feel like she was a bit sour and finally, 3) her consistent need for a man in her life. This latter I blame Anders. She never defines Waverly's character throughout the film. Is she a feminist? Is she as independent as we all thought? Does she create or simply steal from other's misfortunes? These are simple questions that should have been answered throughout the film, but instead we are nearly forced to explode (as stated before) as more and more information is jammed down our vision. It is nearly sickening. While Illeana doesn't carry the weight of disaster completely on her own shoulders, there are other characters that just didn't seem to fit the mold of the film. Bruce Davison and Matt Dillon seemed to be completely miscast in their respective roles, again constantly reminding us that we were watching a film, not immersing ourselves in a vivid story.The only character that I can give credit towards is John Turturro's Joel Millner. Turturro took his bit part to a new level always giving enough so that we constantly waited for him to reappear on screen. He was like an animated cartoon that brought more to the screen than any of the other characters mentioned above. That is sad to see for a film of this caliber, but it is what occurred. So, you take the grandiose excitement of the music and couple it with some sub-par acting and what do you get? Grace of My Heart in its purest form.Overall, it is never good to use more than one Fonda in your film. If you find yourself going with more than one, you should really be reconsidering your options. Matt Dillon completely ruined this film for me, while my keen eye had a blast picking out today's artists in this film. I just wish more was developed with Douglas' character. Why did she continually fall into love with the wrong men? Did anyone else catch that her creative songs were developed from the suffering of others? Finally, why did we bring up her family's fortune if it was never used throughout the film? I kept waiting for her to use her family money to build upon the climax of the film, but it never happened. I felt cheated, as I did several times during this film. It wasn't a bad movie by any means, but it just wouldn't stand out in a crowd.

It set the tone and created the atmosphere for this film. As a viewer, you could close your eyes, ignore the spoken words of this film, and get completely lost in the music. The way that Anders incorporated established, modern singers to bring this era of the 50s, 60s, and 70s to life were brilliant. She deserved the accolades that followed the musical footsteps of this film, sadly &#133; I don't think she quite had a firm grip on the rest of the story.What I mean by this is that while the songs established the film, the story and characters hurt it. Illeana Douglas does exceptionally well with the material presented to her, but she just doesn't quite drag you into her life. You never quite feel as if you are right there with her experiencing her sorrows, excitements, and pain as she trudges through this man-infested life of hers. You watch her go through the motions, but you never feel that tear erupt or couch-excitement brew. It just doesn't happen, and why &#133; because 1) she never ages throughout the course of 20ish years (only gets thinner and thinner) 2) her voice is semi-whiney through the entire film causing us to feel like she was a bit sour and finally, 3) her consistent need for a man in her life. This latter I blame Anders. She never defines Waverly's character throughout the film. Is she a feminist? Is she as independent as we all thought? Does she create or simply steal from other's misfortunes? These are simple questions that should have been answered throughout the film, but instead we are nearly forced to explode (as stated before) as more and more information is jammed down our vision. It is nearly sickening. While Illeana doesn't carry the weight of disaster completely on her own shoulders, there are other characters that just didn't seem to fit the mold of the film. Bruce Davison and Matt Dillon seemed to be completely miscast in their respective roles, again constantly reminding us that we were watching a film, not immersing ourselves in a vivid story.The only character that I can give credit towards is John Turturro's Joel Millner. Turturro took his bit part to a new level always giving enough so that we constantly waited for him to reappear on screen. He was like an animated cartoon that brought more to the screen than any of the other characters mentioned above. That is sad to see for a film of this caliber, but it is what occurred. So, you take the grandiose excitement of the music and couple it with some sub-par acting and what do you get? Grace of My Heart in its purest form.Overall, it is never good to use more than one Fonda in your film. If you find yourself going with more than one, you should really be reconsidering your options. Matt Dillon completely ruined this film for me, while my keen eye had a blast picking out today's artists in this film. I just wish more was developed with Douglas' character. Why did she continually fall into love with the wrong men? Did anyone else catch that her creative songs were developed from the suffering of others? Finally, why did we bring up her family's fortune if it was never used throughout the film? I kept waiting for her to use her family money to build upon the climax of the film, but it never happened. I felt cheated, as I did several times during this film. It wasn't a bad movie by any means, but it just wouldn't stand out in a crowd. Grace of My Heart is the wallflower of the cinematic world.Grade ** out of ***** ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music"},{"date":"4 May 2005","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" this movie is the ultimate scare. there is nothing that could ever take the place of it. i have been watching halloween for 18 years and i still get scared to walk down the stairs at night and look out the glass doors in fear he might be out there watching me...how sad is that i know... the music and sound effects of this movie just make it happen it scares me and makes me jump every time he pops up. just the idea of someone standing outside my house or across the street waiting and watching, its the ultimate scare ..... but its brilliant that this movie can have that sort of effect on people.....to this day.... its going to take a lot to top this movie, no matter how good the effects are. and i hope they NEVER make a remake of it, like they have done with so many other horror films!

Plausible plot? Unnecessary! Decent acting? Unnecessary! Respect shown to its mighty progenitor? Unnecessary! Yes it's another offensively stuffed turkey in the Butch Bruce canon.I mean where do you start with this film? Okay, let's begin with the woeful misapprehension people might have that this was, in some way, related to either the book or the original film, The Day of the Jackal. It's not. In fact it's so different (and so bad) that Fredrick Forsyth asked to have his name taken off it. Now I'm not necessarily a stuffy Brit who can't hack Hollywood remaking British films. Well, okay, maybe I am a bit like that, but fortunately it's a redundant point in this case. This film is so different to the original that the name and the odd reference are the only things that survive.Now let's move to the premise. Cheesy Russian gangster gets killed in a Moscow police raid (somehow involving the FBI although no one bothers to explain why). In revenge, brother of gangster decides to wreak vengeance by killing the wife of the US President (although again no one bothers to explain why this is a good move &#150; although to be fair it was pre-9-11, so he wasn't to know it would have resulted in the US airforce carpet bombing Eastern Europe). Gangster hires nasty killer (Willis). Police hire cuddly killer (Gere), cuddly killer tracks nasty killer. Police fanny around and periodically get killed. Cuddly killer kills nasty killer. First lady is saved and we all realise that the IRA are just this bunch of real sweet guys y'know, who just happen to want to kill innocent people. Nice.Let's put to one side the distasteful Hollywood habit of playing in the troubles of Northern Ireland like it was a sandpit in a theme park (I deal with this point more extensively on the message boards). If Hollywood directors want to cast the Belfast butchers as hookers with hearts of gold, that's up to them. I, of course, reserve the right to despise them for it. It's a free country.More egregious, however, is the fact that the film manages to patronise and insult the Irish while trying to support them. That's not politically distasteful, it's far worse it's incompetent. It's no wonder, for instance, that Gere still looks so damn good, given that he slept through the entire six months it took to make this piece of cra*p. The fact that Gere's accent is not only Southern Irish, but an appalling parody of Southern Irish shows that the filmmakers weren't looking much beyond America to make money from this film. Then there is that lovely scene at the end where Sidney Poitier (a complete waste of space in this film) says he's off for a coffee, offers to get our cuddly IRA man one, then casually says Ah, but then you guys drink Guinness don't you. Yeah that's right Sidney; the Irish live on Guinness and potatoes.While we're on the subject of Poitier why? In the original film the detective is the tracker. In Jackal, Gere is the tracker. So what does Poitier do? Well, he just hangs around and looks like a tw*at of course. He's got absolutely nothing to do apart from call in the marines at the end, and he only does this because the nice IRA man tells him to.While we're on the subject of Gere why? I suppose it's only a matter of time before Hollywood remakes Gandhi with Vin Diesel playing ex-Mujahideen Commando Mahatma Gandhi beheading his way through 1940s and 50s India (he is, after all, a bit dark of hue and therefore very likely to be a Muslim fundamentalist). Let's not forget that Gere's character is a killer and therefore a nasty piece of work. And if he's not, why does he know The Jackal? If he's not, why does he know all his moves? And if he is, why is he such a limp biscuit and such a loveable person? All this goes to show that the makers of this film couldn't be bothered to (a) think about the plot (b) have the characters making decisions that were in keeping with their character(c) avoid cheesy stereotypes like having the big boss bad guy kill his own friend &#150; I honestly thought this had turned into a Bond movie (d) give the central characters something to do (e) credit the audience with a modicum of intelligence.This film is an insult to the British and Irish killed at the hands of terrorists, it's an insult to the Irish people, it's an insult to not great, but pretty good film it rips off, and an insult to the intelligence. But most of all &#150; and most unforgivable &#150; it is an insult to my a*rse for having to sit through the over two hours of run time it took to finish. Honestly, you'd think with no plot, no characters and no dialogue, it would be over in no time. But they didn't even have the decency to quit early.

He falls backwards into the crowds' hands, who treat him like he was stage-diving...(backwards... unmoving... with a big, red spot on the front of his suit... honestly, how much does the film-makers expect us to swallow?) No, seriously. At that point(well, actually even before that) I knew that the movie I was about to see wouldn't have any value or serve as anything even remotely interesting.

You don't have to be a genius to figure out it's a fake name(oh, sorry, an 'artistic' name... please). You want to know his real name? Check his biography. No, wait, I'll make it even easier; I'll tell you. It's Mark Vincent. Now doesn't that just sound cool? No? Well, apparently Mark didn't think so either. What's that? He was convinced that he wouldn't be popular with that name? Well, Schwarzenegger didn't change his name. Neither did Van Damme. They seem popular enough... right? The truth is, Mark is just a poser... he's just another muscled guy who can't act but who is attractive to the girls(god only knows what they find so damn amazing by that brainless jock). He spends half of the movie talking about how it's bull that video-games and violent movies corrupt the American youth, and you can't help but think about what he says... and realize it's true. He's the one corrupting them, he and anyone else responsible for this movie and any other of its kind. All this talk of anarchy and the general 'screw you' attitude towards any form of authority... seriously, it's like they're trying hard to turn kids against parents, teachers and cops. Isn't America sufficiently plagued with young criminals? And what the hell is up with the thoroughly misogynistic way of presenting female characters? Just about all of them are whores and generally just there to please the men.

I think her exact words are 'I could be your girl instead of his(the bad guy's)... if you would pay me as much as he does'. OK, so maybe she isn't really a prostitute... but she falls head over heels over Mark, after knowing him for very little time. Finally, I'd just like to say that the effects are generally horrid, the action is dull, derivative and lacking in any imagination or creativity and the weapon\/gadgets usually work as a huge tease.

About three minutes into the film, a guy(who is *clearly* a secret agent, and clearly meant to die right away) runs through a crowded dance floor, knowing he's been spotted. Instead of trying to disappear in the crowd(come on, nobody does that anymore... right? I mean, it wouldn't do anything... not even throw off the orientation of whoever is chasing him and give the sniper aiming at him a run for his money), he jumps up on the stage... making himself the most obvious freaking target ever. So what happens? He gets shot. Big surprise. Yeah, but what happens next? He falls backwards into the crowds' hands, who treat him like he was stage-diving...(backwards... unmoving... with a big, red spot on the front of his suit... honestly, how much does the film-makers expect us to swallow?) No, seriously. At that point(well, actually even before that) I knew that the movie I was about to see wouldn't have any value or serve as anything even remotely interesting. It's not even a decent time-killer... I've stared at spots that were far more exciting than the fake, clearly orchestrated action. I've seen drunks and stoners that were more coordinated than the gun hit placements in this film. The plot makes no conceivable sense. The pacing is so far off that I'm surprised I didn't fall asleep a few minutes(not to say it wasn't a struggle). The acting is horrendous, with one or two possible exceptions. One thing I want to make perfectly clear; Vin Diesel is NOT one of those exceptions. Vin Diesel... what kind of a damn name is that? You don't have to be a genius to figure out it's a fake name(oh, sorry, an 'artistic' name... please). You want to know his real name? Check his biography. No, wait, I'll make it even easier; I'll tell you. It's Mark Vincent. Now doesn't that just sound cool? No? Well, apparently Mark didn't think so either. What's that? He was convinced that he wouldn't be popular with that name? Well, Schwarzenegger didn't change his name. Neither did Van Damme. They seem popular enough... right? The truth is, Mark is just a poser... he's just another muscled guy who can't act but who is attractive to the girls(god only knows what they find so damn amazing by that brainless jock). He spends half of the movie talking about how it's bull that video-games and violent movies corrupt the American youth, and you can't help but think about what he says... and realize it's true. He's the one corrupting them, he and anyone else responsible for this movie and any other of its kind. All this talk of anarchy and the general 'screw you' attitude towards any form of authority... seriously, it's like they're trying hard to turn kids against parents, teachers and cops. Isn't America sufficiently plagued with young criminals? And what the hell is up with the thoroughly misogynistic way of presenting female characters? Just about all of them are whores and generally just there to please the men. No protests, no 'I'm better than this stuff' attitude anywhere... they just accept that women are made to serve men, and nothing else. The one female character who isn't giving it away for free as my favorite character ever, Dr. Cox of the TV show Scrubs would put it, is still a hooker. I think her exact words are 'I could be your girl instead of his(the bad guy's)... if you would pay me as much as he does'. OK, so maybe she isn't really a prostitute... but she falls head over heels over Mark, after knowing him for very little time. Finally, I'd just like to say that the effects are generally horrid, the action is dull, derivative and lacking in any imagination or creativity and the weapon\/gadgets usually work as a huge tease. Being the big lover of weapons that I am, I was a tad excited when Mark was handed what has to be one of the biggest damn hand-cannons seen on film. Imagine my disappointment when the sap barely uses it at all. The same goes for gadgets(less important, but still). Also, near the end, Mark gets to drive a bad-ass car with a trunk-load(literally) of destructive hardware... and it's only used for having the typical 'there must be something here we can use\/oh what does this button do then' scene. The characters are all stereotypes and clich√©s, with Mark being the guy who saves the world because he has muscles, a low vocabulary, a ridiculous accent and some poor one-liners, Asia being the girl who falls in love with Mark for no apparent reason, the geek who gives Mark his gadgets(I won't bother to change his name). Eve even shows up, seemingly just to tell off a video game producer... because Mark won't 'sell out'. Whatever the hell that means. Wouldn't someone fighting for video-games be honored or consider it a victory to have his own game? I recommend this only to fans of Mark as well as mindless teenagers with no conception of how the real world works. If you're still not sure, yes, I do hate Mark Vincent\/Vin Diesel. I really do. 1\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure"},{"date":"4 May 2005","score":"4 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" More people who voted on this movie gave it a 1 than a 5 (1 being the lowest, 5 being medium, 10 obviously the highest).

And it certainly does play on that level. The protagonist goes back to listening to the Who, smoking pot, working in a fast food joint, and lusting after a high school girl. Plus he gets the car that turned him on when he was a teenager. Bonus! Oh, and he dies happy. But more on that later.This movie also plays (rather shamelessly I thought) to some nicely pointed clich√©s of the times. Gays are good, the military is bad, stuff like that. Gays are people and so are colonels, and some are good and some are bad, but when making a movie that seeks to draw sharp contrasts between happy and sad it helps to start with good and evil.There are lots of colors in this movie too. Jim's tie, Jane's room, all those roses. And swirling surrealism. Beautiful.The colors and the return to hedonism and the joy of plate throwing are what give this movie part of its kick.

Family A has too little love. They don't hate each other, the husband wants the best for his wife even when he finds out she's been cheating on him, the wife is horrified to think she has hurt him.

But the production values, direction, editing, dialogue, etc were not very good, and people have a right to not like a movie with problems like these.So what was good about it? It was just a lot of fun, the way bad movies sometimes can be. The cast is top-notch; even heavyweights like Harvey Keitel (as the devil, and he did a superb job), Patricia Arquette, and Reese Witherspoon (hilarious as a valley girl angel) seem to be having a great time here. The regulars from other Adam Sandler movies are also entertaining, and the cast is rounded out by a veritable who's who of comedy talent, like Jon Lovits, Rodney Dangerfield (basically doing his usual schtick as Lucifer, the devil's father), Kevin Nealon, Dana Carvey, George Wallace, Michael McKean, Ellen Cleghorne, Clint Howard... sure most of these people are washed up, but who cares? They're still funny; Jon Lovits in particular shows how good he is in these small parts (something he's done many times in the past). Robert Smigel is also good as the voice of Beefy the dog. Rounding it out are Rhys Ifans (who I'm not really familiar with) and Tiny Lister (inspired casting!) as Nicky's brothers, a host of cameos, many of whom play themselves (Regis and Ozzy are hilarious, and Henry Winkler and Carl Weathers appear, referencing older Adam Sandler movies), and of course Sandler himself as Little Nicky, the devil's nicer son.

Although the dialogue is bad, the one-liners are often hilarious, and although the production values are bad, the sight gags are often hilarious. So enjoy the movie for what it is an entertaining, if not well-done, piece of fluff, along the lines of, say, Cheech and Chong, not up to the quality of Sandler's other movies (and I stand by that, I think there is real quality in movies like The Wedding Singer or Happy Gilmore or even The Waterboy), but still pretty damn funny in it's own right.

Her life should be an inspiration, not in our daily lives, but in our dreams and fantasies. One thing, though. If only it were longer, so that I could have lost myself further in Amelie's beautiful world. Now, I'm off to pack my bags for Paris!

Like its title, Amelie's fabulous life is effortlessly transferred onto a fabulous film. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's visual touches are all evident, but this time he added some heart to it, which has been missing since the brilliant Delicatessen. Audrey Tatou is the epitome of Paris chic, and Kassovitz is brilliant in his near silent role. Paris has rarely been this beautiful, without the tourists and usual romantic clich√© sights.

Scott gave us many great performances over his brilliant career and this is yet another. Scott stars as John Russell, a middle aged music professor who witnesses the tragic accidental death of his wife and young daughter. Four months after this happens he decides to move to Seattle, Washington and teach college there. He looks for a house to rent and finds one with the help of a young, beautiful realtor named Claire Norman (his off-screen wife Trish Van Devere). It is a very large mansion with a unknown past and Russell is happy living there at first. But all is not well at Chessman Park. A malevolent spirit soon makes its presence known to John and it is not at rest. John believes it is trying to communicate with him due to his previous traumatic experience and he feels it wants him to figure something out most likely its own death. As Russell starts to dig deeper into the house's history and he slowly yet steadily begins to unravel an evil conspiracy which is as powerful as it is mysterious and threatens to destroy Russell and Claire before they can escape its deadly grasp. There are three or four scenes in particular that will shock and frighten you especially the bathroom scene and the attic scene. I would not recommend this for small children or sensitive adults. And I feel compelled to mention the stairway scene with the ball is a legend in horror films and was even parodied in Scary Movie 2 if anyone would like to know. The wheelchair scene is also horrifying and cleverly done. Certainly one of the most scary and haunting films you will ever see it makes my own top ten list of best horror films ever made.

From its opening shots of a dragonfly being squashed by a car on a beautifully winding brick road in Montmartre, the wind causing wine glasses to dance up and down on a restaurant's tablecloth, and an elderly man erasing the name of an old friend out of his address book after his funeral, the viewers of Amelie know they are in for something both visually and literally stunning. Truly, it was the camera-work of director Jean-Pierre Jeunet that initially captivates the viewer (the whole scene in the rain on the bridge as Amelie's mother pours her goldfish from the bridge into the creek is beautiful; that gliding, overhead shot could be viewed over and over again without losing its appeal), not to mention the vibrant colors of Paris and the quick exploration of wild tangents somehow related to the bigger story. But after all is said and done, and the tricks of Jeunet have lost their initial luster, it's the screenplay and the characters especially that cause the audience to remain captivated.Audrey Tautou brilliantly evokes the oddball characteristics of Amelie Poulain without resorting to turning her into a hollow caricature. Despite her eccentricities, Tautou's performance helps the audience see elements of themselves scattered throughout her everyday feelings, longings, and, at times, actions that are so creatively translated to the screen in a type of visual symbolism that is almost so simple to comprehend, yet so difficult to evoke without dialogue. In closing, this is an excellent movie, and an even better character study involving people who, despite living on the other side of the world, hold so much in common with ourselves. If you feel discouraged by foreign films, please don't let that stop you from seeing Amelie. I honestly kept forgetting that I was even reading French at the bottom of the screen because I was so caught up in the visual style, story, and fresh bursts of comedy.

It has two annoying teenage characters, very overweight Rose, played by chubby Kate Winslet, and skinny teenage brat\/artist, Jack, played by Leo DiCaprio.You would think that the film would be about the Titanic, right?
