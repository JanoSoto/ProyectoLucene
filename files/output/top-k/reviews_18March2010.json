A teenage Regan is ready to deal with her memories of her terrifying demonic possession at age 12. All that can be said after viewing this spectacle is that Boorman was hugely influenced by the Italian horror masters, Argento, Bava, Lucio Fulci, etc. The overwrought drama, the astoundingly bizarre, hallucinogenic imagery, the intentionally artificial-looking, but mind blowing sets; He even employed Ennio Morricone to create the atmospheric, and beautiful score, a score that accompanies the images on screen in an unforgettable way. The Heretic bears so many similarities to films like Suspiria and Lisa & the Devil that it is ridiculous that more people don't notice this. One of many examples; the final scene where Regan and Father Lamont turn and walk into the trippy, ghostly horizon, filmed from a wide shot, is virtually identical to the final scene of The Beyond, Lucio Fulci's bizarre and surreal cult shocker. The Beyond was released in 1981, four years after The Heretic, so it seems that at least one cult Italian director was quite impressed with this one. If you have seen an Italian giallo than you can imagine the look of 'Heretic.' And just like in the great giallo's, the acting is over-dramatic, the lines uttered by the characters are sometimes silly, weird, or just plain indecipherable. The story is totally unbelievable while at the same time the ideas get inside your head and make you think, and wonder. Boorman has always been a visionary, and he does not disappoint with the look and dreamlike feel of Heretic.' Linda Blair plays her part with an enchanting innocence, and Richard Burton, reportedly drunk through most of the filming, delivers his lines with as much passion and drama as if he were doing Shakespeare. The gaudy, colorful re-creation of the African landscape is a centerpiece of this film, and POV scenes of the locusts flying overhead give the audience the feeling that we are indeed flying, and traveling to mysterious lands, or even other worlds, as Africa resembles the planet Mars in some shots! This is the most European-style American film i have seen, and i have to wonder how this film was received overseas. If you are looking for gratuitous vomit and head-spinning scenes, you won't find it here. Instead you will be treated to a more mystical, and even spiritual experience. Opinions on Exorcist II The Heretic vary as much as this film does from it's predecessor. But one thing cannot be denied; there has rarely been a film with the overwhelming look and atmosphere of this bizarre cult film.

He made the greatest action movie ever made and also one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time, The Terminator 2 Judgment Day. The Terminator was excellent too, but 2 surpassed even that. By only these two movies, he has become one of the greatest directors of all time, don't you agree? However, it was really weird that he wanted to make such a movie. Thus, Titanic does not look like a James Cameron movie at all and additionally it is lack of creativity, James Cameron creativity. You know, by considering The Terminator movies, you can see how a creative director James Cameron is. Titanic is an ordinary movie, a simple movie on all counts. Everything is simple that I will mention later. At that time, Leonardo Di Caprio was at the top, the beloved of teenage girls, in fact, young or not, females were admirers of him. I like Di Caprio and he is still liked, may be even more because of the performances he gave in his recent movies, but what I am trying to say is that I try to find out the reasons, why a lot of people love the movie and it broke a record at the box office, became the most watched film of all time? It was owing to Di Caprio? Well, I don't think so, I mean not only owing to him which is sad. Because as said the movie is simple on all counts. As for Kate Winslett, as an actress, she is one of my favorite actresses ever, I just love her, but players cannot save a movie, this is what I believe. The love story is simple. Let me summarize it one more time. A poor boy. A rich girl. And the rich (and black hearted) fiancée of that girl. The family of the girl want their daughter marry him, but she is not sure. Then, the poor boy and the girl meet and fall in love with each other. See? You know, James Cameron is rather an action (and science fiction) director, isn't he? and this is a disaster movie besides romance, isn't it? but this side of the matter, action, excitement are simple either. You expect the same masterful, perfectionist and creative level for Titanic, but it is not. I did not get satisfy on this count, because Cameron does not focus on disaster, he focuses on romance and this is weird. This is a three hours movie, but the disaster side of it is unsatisfying. Therefore, the people who had expected an exciting, suspenseful disaster movie disappoint like me. As for the Oscar issue, yes it broke a record in the Oscar history too, 11 Oscars! To me, there are two wrong decisions in the Oscar history. One is Titanic's 11 Oscar winning, the other is Shakespeare in Love won the best picture Oscar instead of Saving Private Ryan. I should confess that the other was much more painful, because if you ask me, to give the best picture Oscar to Shakespeare in Love while one of the other nominees is Saving Private Ryan is something like to give the best picture Oscar to The Notebook while one of the other nominees is 12 Angry Men. Returning to Titanic, the love story in it is not heavy or dull at all like Shakespeare in Love by the way which is good news and despite I am not female, it was real touching and at the end, my ears filled with tears. However, unfortunately these do not make the movie great. Let's talk about the branches which Titanic won Oscar. By the way, as for entertainment, yes I was entertained, but not very much. The best editing. Well, this is not Memento or Amores Perros, the editing was 'normal' in this one. The best cinematography. If it is one of the bests, then what is Amelie then for example or Across the Universe? The best costume design. What were the costumes, daily life costumes? Yes. Titanic was not a period movie exactly wasn't it? Even if it was, the costumes were ordinary, daily life costumes. The best art direction. Again, Titanic is 'normal' on this count. Amelie, 2001, Batman, these are the examples come to my mind now. If we talk about the themes of the movie, it is seen that they are simple either as everything else.

I got the point ( i mean i read Bret Easton Ellis's book, but i read it long after i watched and loved the movie) and i loved it. Christian Bale (who i might say is one of the best, if not the best, actors currently working) does a great job playing socialite Patrick Bateman, who's only obsessions in life are taking extremely good care of himself (using a large variety of beauty products, obsessively working out, etc.), going to the bests night clubs and restaurants, and last but not least, satisfying his increasing homicidal impulses. In fact early in the movie we see that Patrick Bateman isn't at all how he wants to be seen by his peers (he is shown as a charming stock broker who has friends and a girlfriend), in fact he is an increasingly psychotic homicidal man who is so bored with his yuppie lifestyle that the only way he feels alive and really feels in touch with the world that surrounds him is by engaging in disturbing and gruesome murders. The worst part is that even with his increasingly chaotic and erratic behavior, he seems more aware about the disconnection from humanity that this yuppie lifestyle gives to the people in it than his peers (theres is a scene in which Patrick and his friends are literally drooling over some presentation cards). I don't think that Harron's approach to the story is at all perfect (having already read the book), and as i said is a pretty tough story to understand. But in her defense, one of the greatest things of a story like American psycho is that you have to keep an open mind to see beyond the violence and the massacres, which also happens while reading the book. As i said Bale's performance is just plain excellent, it might seem over the top sometimes, but believe me, thats Patrick Bateman a man constantly over the edge of psychotic boredom who could snap at any moment. The funny thing is that their co-workers are so clueless about everything and so self-centered that they don't seem to realize the homicidal maniac they have next door (not even by the fact Patrick sometimes playfully confesses his urges to them). Bale deserved at least Oscar buzz for this role, he is just plain perfect. As a side note, i hope Hollywood starts rewarding him for his carefully methodical performances or he could easily become the next Jeff bridges (a great actor whose every performances are nearly flawless but doesn't get the recognition he deserves) i know Bridges won the Oscar this year, but it was long overdue. The supporting cast is very good too. By playing clueless and self centered characters the wrong actor might look stiff, but the cast does a great job with their roles. Chloe Sevigny, willem Dafoe, Josh Lucas,.. All the cast do a great job with their respective roles. All in all is a great movie, and one of my all time favorites. Is the kind of movie in which with every new viewing you start noticing new elements and themes that are being developed and satirized. Great Performances, Extremely great cult classic.

This doesn't work so well, but he meets a hustler named Ricco Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) who takes him in and helps him learn the ways of the street. The two become friends and do what they can to survive.I enjoyed every minute of this film. The music, the characters, the presentation... it was all very well-crafted. I can't say I'm a huge Jon Voight fan, but here he did a fine job. And Dustin Hoffman did a supremely convincing job. Hoffman is always good, but this is one of his best roles, by far.I really appreciated the very mild gay subtext, if it existed at all. You can interpret it either way. The director is gay and in the book the characters are gay, but here they are presented as straight... more best buddies than gay lovers. I think that's probably how we should see them, but in light of the book it's hard to say for sure. (Roger Ebert calls this a love story, so he's weighing in, too.) Ebert thinks the film's weakness is the psychedelic scenery, and I agree. I thought some of the flashbacks were a bit much, yet necessary, but the psychedelic parts were over the top and made this a sixties film rather than a timeless film that it might have been otherwise. I was less distracted by the scenes of 42nd Street and Tiffany's. I don't think I disapprove as strongly as Ebert, does, however, as I rate the film overall much higher than he does.

She was trying to shield me from the rough language and lurid violence. There sure was a lot of both but more so there were great characters. Vivid, real, flesh and blood souls that acted on well drawn impulses and ambitions. Consequences were openly inevitable but somehow jarring, devastating and poignant. Historical elements were stunningly precise yet grandly broad and vast. I was entirely, absolutely overwhelmed by the visceral sensations and sprawling imagery. So this is what literature is all about. This is what reading, I now understood, could be. I had been something of a sci-fi junkie previously, but from then on I was a converted disciple of the Great American Fable. The story was truly great and I never could have imagined a better one until I finally saw the movies.Astoundingly, Francis Ford Coppola's film adaptations surpass the novel in a few key details. The casting of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is the single greatest improvement on the original story. Where in the novel, Michael is something of a strapping, virile, obviously competent man of action, Coppola introduces a crucial element of doubt by way of Pacino's diminutive stature. Though we are told Michael is a returning war hero, we are skeptical of his leadership abilities, especially in the company of such physically imposing figures as his father and oldest brother Sonny. Pacino's bodily disadvantage works to emphasize the complexities of his reluctance to join in the Family Enterprise, and makes his cerebral and emotional challenges that much more epic.The other notable improvement on the book, of course is Marlon Brando, who created one of the most indelible characters for the big screen. There wasn't then, nor is there now, any other person in the industry who could so monumentally fulfill the herculean task with which that character is charged. Don Vito Corleone's function in the story is metaphorical, transcendent, mythological. He is the living embodiment of the ageless value of Heritage. Heritage which only endures through the tenuous bonds of family unity, but transported to a young, naive, unsympathetic land, is now being severely tested. But since Godfather II begins after the Don is dead it is faced with the considerable challenge of how to maintain this crucial historical perspective. So, Gf 2 immediately whisks us back into time with a vignette of Vito's tragic childhood in turn-of-the-century Sicily. Later begins a series of flashbacks to his early manhood in New York City played by a sublimely low key Robert DeNiro. Oddly, he is not engaged in acts of wanton destruction, sociological delinquency or self indulgent pride. Rather, we are casually informed of Vito's entry into the underworld by way of seemingly reasonable acts. He is drawn as a man not just doing what is necessary to survive in the rough, often brutal New World, but driven by his familial responsibilities and a sense of duty to his community. The period from which we are flashing is the late 1950s and early 1960s. By butting the old up against the new we are offered a sparkling view of the clash of cultures, of just how much had changed in those few decades. This dichotomy introduces a two fold historical perspective. By way of the contrasts between early and mid century life we are being informed of our present day (1972 and after) cultural afflictions. It's a subtle, almost invisible point, but one that is, I believe, extremely profound, the central theme of the story, and even more relevant today. Consider how, just one single decade after the time when the story ends to when the films were made, American life had so radically changed. Now consider how much things have changed since then.While most fans of the film are impressed with the robust characters, compelling dialog and and terrific action produced with expert cinematic skill, I was even more fascinated by the film's more abstract qualities. Coppola, much more so than Puzo, is playing Socrates here, posing a dialectic query - How is it that primal cultural tenets might survive in a climate of overwhelming opposition? Francis is troubled, alarmed by the assault on vital culture that all humanity is experiencing today, and obviously very cynical that cherished and valuable, essential traditions can persist. This cynicism was a pervasive theme at the close of the sixties and it infused nearly all the great art of the time. Remember, the year of the book's publication, 1969, also saw the release of Easy Rider. Not insignificantly, that too was a story of social outsiders, antiheroes colliding with an increasingly corrupt, immoral majority. This cynicism is the intellectual, psychological and emotional driving force of the The Godfather I & II, and it's the thing that kept me coming back to them, again and again. So, what for many is simply a superb, if not the greatest, Gangster Movie, is for me one of the finest critical views of the American Way. It is, in fact, irrelevant that the Corleones are mobsters, because ultimately what destroyed them is what is destroying all Americans. The disintegration of the essential commitment to family and community - our succumbing to all the temptations that undermine our strengths - is our downfall. It's no coincidence that the tragedy ultimately concludes in Las Vegas, the spiritual center of America's true religion, the Capitol City of Temptation. Our cultural decline has progressed to where it is now terminally incurable. Great art in the service of a dying society. We have all become Fredo.

Now consider how much things have changed since then.While most fans of the film are impressed with the robust characters, compelling dialog and and terrific action produced with expert cinematic skill, I was even more fascinated by the film's more abstract qualities. Coppola, much more so than Puzo, is playing Socrates here, posing a dialectic query - How is it that primal cultural tenets might survive in a climate of overwhelming opposition? Francis is troubled, alarmed by the assault on vital culture that all humanity is experiencing today, and obviously very cynical that cherished and valuable, essential traditions can persist. This cynicism was a pervasive theme at the close of the sixties and it infused nearly all the great art of the time. Remember, the year of the book's publication, 1969, also saw the release of Easy Rider. Not insignificantly, that too was a story of social outsiders, antiheroes colliding with an increasingly corrupt, immoral majority. This cynicism is the intellectual, psychological and emotional driving force of the The Godfather I & II, and it's the thing that kept me coming back to them, again and again. So, what for many is simply a superb, if not the greatest, Gangster Movie, is for me one of the finest critical views of the American Way. It is, in fact, irrelevant that the Corleones are mobsters, because ultimately what destroyed them is what is destroying all Americans. The disintegration of the essential commitment to family and community - our succumbing to all the temptations that undermine our strengths - is our downfall. It's no coincidence that the tragedy ultimately concludes in Las Vegas, the spiritual center of America's true religion, the Capitol City of Temptation. Our cultural decline has progressed to where it is now terminally incurable. Great art in the service of a dying society. We have all become Fredo.

Stanley Kubrick\/Jack Nicholson fans cannot seem to praise it enough, while fans of Stephen King's legendary novel are decidedly more lukewarm towards it. Personally I find the film rather schizophrenic, which leaves me somewhere in the middle. Anyone hoping to see even a marginally faithful adaptation of the King novel will be sorely disappointed as aside from the very bare bones of the story, many of King's memorable set pieces and much of the emotional pull of his story has been abandoned. Aspiring writer Jack Torrance and family are hired on to become caretakers of the oppressive Overlook Hotel during its off season in the wilds of the Rocky Mountains. Despite the threat of isolation and stories of a prior caretaker who went mad and murdered his family, the Torrances persevere and find out that the hotel has some rather nasty spooks determined to set Jack against his wife and son. Director Kubrick provides a chilling and ominous atmosphere thanks to hypnotic cinematography and amazing sets. The corridors of the hotel seem to go on forever. The film has its decidedly chilling moments &#x96; particularly the appearances of murdered twins, Nicholson's ax-wielding attack on wife Shelley Duvall and a memorable chase through a wintry labyrinth. Unfortunately, it has some glaring problems narratively and with its lead performance that cannot be overlooked. The title of the film is the slang term given to a psychic power possessed by both Danny Lloyd as the son and Scatman Crothers, as a hotel chef. In the King novel, the power was a major player in the story. In the film, both Danny and his power seem an afterthought and the hotel &#x96; which was decidedly malevolent in King's story &#x96; comes across as rather a neutral entity that just houses nasty specters. Danny's primal fear that his father will turn into a monster that will murder he and his mother is oddly muted in the film &#x96; largely because Kubrick treats the characters and their emotional plight as of little consequence and is much more concerned with setting the stage for Nicholson to enact his raving madman performance. Sadly, Nicholson's much-ballyhooed central performance nearly derails the film. At no point does anyone buy him as a caring husband\/father who makes a shocking transition into a psycho. Instead, Nicholson plays him from the outset as a creepy nut with pedophile mannerisms to such an extent, that it becomes impossible to believe that anyone would follow him into another room much less into a 3-month isolation with a young child. While Lloyd is largely relegated to prop status speaking in a strange voice and drooling, Nicholson stomps and chomps the scenery sputtering, snarling, and hissing in between inappropriate one-liners. There is no doubt that his madman act is impressive, but it is also one-note and robs his character of any sympathy. Seriously, from frame one there is not one moment where he seems relatively normal and there is no moment where he shows any reluctance in his descent into madness. This film also serves the dubious distinction of marking when Nicholson's performances segued from real acting into caricature until About Schmidt came to the rescue. By contrast, it is not until reflection that one realizes Duvall, as his terrified wife, has delivered the film's best performance and shown him up. Additionally, the final shot of the film, which is apparently supposed to be a surprise, is anything but, indicating that Kubrick and his writers are not overly familiar with horror genres conventions. Yet for all its faults, the atmosphere and lavishness provided by Kubrick is a definite must-see in that few subsequent thrillers have been able to compete with it and he does provide moments they stay with you, even if the end product is not as impressive as some of its parts.

This is a great tagline and has made its way into far wider usage than just this movie. Just as well, because it's another thing which is never explained (nor is why these intermittent killings must involve swordfights ending in decapitation).The absence of any explanation doesn't matter in the slightest - everything is offered simply as part of the mythology of the Immortals. It just IS, and there is absolutely no reason why any of it needs to be explained to the Immortals themselves, let alone the likes of you and me.Christophe Lambert is Connor MacLeod, conveying very well the loneliness of a life where everyone you know and love dies, and the only ones who can share that burden want to kill you. Sean Connery plays the Spanish\/Egyptian (with a Scots accent) Ramirez, the most unlikely racial\/cultural combination ever to feature in a mainstream movie, with a genial bonhomie. One wonders why he trains MacLeod rather than killing him. Clancy Brown is an entertainingly monstrous Kurgan, and the supporting cast is absolutely fine.The look of the film is great and the limited effects work well in service to the story.And, yes, it may be the most preposterous tosh, but it's entertaining tosh and, what's more, it's original tosh.

Just as well, because it's another thing which is never explained (nor is why these intermittent killings must involve swordfights ending in decapitation).The absence of any explanation doesn't matter in the slightest - everything is offered simply as part of the mythology of the Immortals. It just IS, and there is absolutely no reason why any of it needs to be explained to the Immortals themselves, let alone the likes of you and me.Christophe Lambert is Connor MacLeod, conveying very well the loneliness of a life where everyone you know and love dies, and the only ones who can share that burden want to kill you. Sean Connery plays the Spanish\/Egyptian (with a Scots accent) Ramirez, the most unlikely racial\/cultural combination ever to feature in a mainstream movie, with a genial bonhomie. One wonders why he trains MacLeod rather than killing him. Clancy Brown is an entertainingly monstrous Kurgan, and the supporting cast is absolutely fine.The look of the film is great and the limited effects work well in service to the story.And, yes, it may be the most preposterous tosh, but it's entertaining tosh and, what's more, it's original tosh.

Now let me get this out of the way, I don't care about politics, I don't like politics and they bore me to tears, this movie sheds it in a whole different light. Jefferson Smith is an honest man not knowing how to handle his spot in the senate, but wants to do everything he can to help his country. No matter how much he's laughed at, no matter how much people beg him to quit, he keeps on ticking until he knows the truth, and until people finally accept for who he is. You won't find a story like this in the world now a days, it's practically guaranteed, but it really shows the American dream so to speak, and really lifts your spirits up when all is said and done. The end where Jefferson is speaking in front of all the people dead tired, is not only classical, but absolutely riveting and remains one of the most intense endings you will find in a movie.Performances. James Stewart is absolutely wonderful in his infamous role as Jefferson Smith. His determination, his willpower, yet his strong vulnerability all made for one compelling character. Stewart is always dependable and I rank this as one of his best performances. Claude Rains is very effective as Senator Paine. He's not the man he used to be, and some of his scenes with Stewart really hit home for me. Jean Arthur is wonderfully classy as Clarissa. Edward Arnold is absolutely ruthless as Taylor, you'll hate him.Bottom line. I'm not a politician, I don't know much about them, frankly I don't care too, they bore me.

It makes you hate humanity or at least question it. The characters are even worse than the things they do. They're often psychotic, half-human wild-eyed mutants that kill without the consulting of a conscience. Horror is anything evil and sadistic....not fun!American Psycho is an exception to the rule. Here we have mild-mannered, clean-cut, and charming Patrick Bateman who has a lucrative career as an investment banker in Lower Manhattan, a million-dollar apartment high-rise, and a 6-figure bank account, and snotty, elitist attitude to boot. But, our snotty Yuppie friend has a secret....a dark secret! He happens to be a serial killer that can't be caught! How's that for terrifying! A Yuppie who's a douchebag, pompous jerk, a nerdy white guy is his own right and has a fetish to murder people.AP is not your average horror film. There's no gore aplenty like in Friday the 13th or the Saw franchise, well there's the part where Bateman chases and eventually kills a woman with a chainsaw down a flight of steps and the bloody scenes inside Paul Allen's apartment. Most of American Psycho's horrid lure is based solely on human psychology wrapped in avant-garde surrealism of 80's Wall Street flash. It's all about craving for absolute attention and being considered a nobody even when you have everything you could ever desire at your feet. Bateman(played by Christian Bale) is both a disturbing and comedic character. Bale's performance has motion rooted in satire and mocks the upper-class lifestyle with perfection. In fact the whole cast except Willem Dafoe and Chloe Sverginy are satirical foils which are at first humorous, then irritating\/annoying, then detestable.The truth is almost every male in this movie is a self-centered assholethat behaves more like a spoiled teenage girl in a locker room gossipping with her friends rather than executives in a boardroom. All they do is compete and talk behind each others backs. You still have the pompous jerk alpha male, the slut, the pure innocent girl, the geek, and the killer himself. With all horror films, the jerk, old bum, a few sluts, indeed get murdered, but it's done so brilliantly and with such discretion. American Psycho is enjoyable for having already obnoxious and rather stupid characters meeting there demise(except the homeless guy with the dog in the alley) that deserve to get killed. You're catching yourself cheering for Patrick Bateman whose the serial killer! Wow! A horror movie that makes you think is a wonderful experience that no one ever experimented before. It's like Sweeney Todd, only this time no one loses an eye and fun doesn't seem to stop! My only criticism is that it could've used more of the 1980's stylistic touch, pastel-colored clothing, a Ferrari Testarossa speeding down Fifth Avenue, etc. What American Psycho should've done was focus on the mid-80's which truly defined the decade in question and evolve into the early 1990's.
