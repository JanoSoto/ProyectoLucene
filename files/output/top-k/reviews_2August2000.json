Plotwise, it follows most other romantic comedy type movies. But still, there is enough here to make it stand out somewhat. Granted, being better than most teen romantic comedies isn't much of an accomplishment, but Loser is a good movie, even though I knew what was going to happen.I thought Jason Biggs played his part as Paul very well. He had the loser-like goofiness that inspired quite a few laughs, but you could also tell how much the character loved Mena Suvari's character, Dora. Greg Kinnear is also very good as Professor Alcott, Dora's love interest at the beginning of the movie. When all is said and done, Paul comes out as a winner, not a Loser, because he realizes that you don't have to fit in with everyone else to be cool. That's what really sets this movie apart from lots of other recent teen movies. It does have a point. Obviously, it's not extremely deep, and it won't change your life or anything, but it's still good, and it makes the movie very worthwhile.I think that lots of people didn't like this movie because they were expecting something along the lines of American Pie, given that both Biggs and Suvari were in that. If you're looking for American Pie, you will not like Loser. Although billed as a comedy, there are some times when it's downright serious, especially further into the movie. If you want non-stop gross-out humor, Loser is not for you. If, however, you want to see a good romantic film, that's funny at times, but serious at other, just like real life, then I think you will enjoy Loser. Yes, the basic plot is quite familiar, but there's enough extra stuff to keep it interesting and make it stand out from the crowd of bad teen comedies that have been around lately.Rating 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 August 2000","score":"11 out of 15 people found the following review useful","review":"  Yes, Loser is a very predictable film.

Sherman, is well on his way to being one of the greatest scientists of all time, when Buddy love starts budding his way back into Sherman's life.  This causes much distress on Sherman, in the midst of marrying or losing  (Jackson) due to Buddy trying to come back out.  So, Sherman discovers a way to pull the gene out of his body, that  &#145;is' Buddy Love.   That's all I'm going to say about this wonderful comedy, from most of the original creators, which is a plus in this case, because sequels that tend to lean more on a break through character, or characters in a first installment, they lack story and structure, yet this film has more of that than the `Nutty Professor'.  It also has more gross-out jokes, which seem to fall flat on most occasions, leaving the best laughs to the Klumps personalities.  Murphy gives us the performance(s) that made us all fall in love with him.  He truly shows form here, an it would be something if he were nominated for best supporting actor as `Cletus Klump'.  He deserves something.

I have always enjoyed movies about sports, in fact I find them more entertaining than the real thing.  Yes, they are predictable, but at least I know who the people are.  You can sort of call this a football version of the baseball classic, THE BAD NEWS BEARS. The professional players of the Washington Sentinels decide to go on strike during the season.  The team owner, O' Neil (Jack Warden) doesn't want the team to quit during mid-season, so he relies on coach McGinty (Gene Hackman) to help find the team some replacement players.  McGinty can find the replacement players, trouble is that each of these players has a excellent quality and a negative quality.  There's Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), a excellent quarterback who is still living in the shadow of his horrible defeat of the Sugar Bowl game some years ago.  Bateman (Jon Favreau) is a tackle happy defense player, the only problem is that he will also tackle his own teammates.  Gruff (Rhys Ifans) is a excellent kicker, but he has a attitude, drinking, and gambling problem.  And there's Franklin (Orlando Jones) a superior runner, one of the fastest, it's just that he can't catch anything.  McGinty has a few weeks to get this team into the finals, while the strike goes on. I enjoyed the humor of this film, since that is what is important for this film.  It does have some new jokes for the sport, and like I said it's the funniest football film since THE LONGEST YARD and the climax of M*A*S*H*.  And speaking of M*A*S*H*, the cheerleaders led by Falco's love intrest Annabelle (a very pretty Brooke Langton), is the most dinginess and funniest cheerleaders since then. The acting is also fine, I got past the Keanu Reeves slow talking character.  It's not one of his best like PARENTHOOD and MATRIX. But it's far better than MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING and JOHNNY MEMONIC.  Gene Hackman gives a wonderful performance as the football veteran who enjoys his replacements more than his regulars since the replacements play the game for the love of it, not the money.

Rhys Ifans is also funny as the slobbish Gruff, if you enjoyed him in NOTTING HILL, you'll enjoy him in this film.

I then didn't watch it for a long time because I had heard it was bad and I saved it for an evening where I wouldn't care.Well, not expecting much, I really enjoyed it.

This film shows me that Ethan Hawke is a good actor and that he should take better roles. Gwyneth Paltrow is the icy and seductive Estella who seduces and plays with Finnegan (Ethan Hawke.) Being taught by her aunt (Anne Banecroft) Estella plays with Finn's emotions and breaks his heart.A good line from the movie is when Anne Bancroft places Finn's hand on her heart and asks What is this? and Young Finn replies Your boob! and she says It's my heart - and it's broken. I thought that was so funny and innocent.When I saw the picture, I thought that Ethan Hawke actually drew the pictures, but he didn't. Gwyneth Paltrow gets more naked in this film than in Shakespeare In Love. I like Gwyneth Paltrow because she is not afraid of taking roles like these - cold, heartless, naked.Great Expectations is one of the best films of 1998. I'm surprised the Academy Awards overlooked it. 9\/10 stars!!!!

But in the anatomy book of genius-tinged animator Nick Park and his cohorts at Aardman, teeth really tell the story. Beginning with the Academy Award-winning 1989 short Creature Comforts and through his epic Wallace and Gromit mini-adventures, Park has filled the mouths of his saunchly English, valiantly middle-class players (clay animated penguins and sheep as well as ladies and gents) with soulful choppers In good times and bad, the set of an Aardman jaw speaks volumes as said penguin, sheep, dog, woman or man adapts with tea-and-toast-loving civility to unpredictable (and usually daunting) fate.In their first full-length feature, the care Park and co-director Peter Lord lavish on the dental work of poultry (who it can now be proven, do have lips) pays off.Chicken Run is a delightful, perceptive, funny, detail-barbed wire, which looks as gloomy as POW barracks; indeed, the command-center hut in which the fearless Ginger plots her flock's great escape bears the same number as that of Stalag 17.Just when Ginger has run out of idea - she gets a little help from the farm's more timid clucker's including Pollyanna-daft Babs, worrying Mac, and overbearing Bunty - a possible savior falls of the sky sky, like a Yank on a parachute mission. According to the circus poster that floats down with him Rocky is The Flying Rooster. Surely he can teach his admiring audience of grounded ladies to do the same?Chicken Run is a can-do comedy built of small, confident gestures. It's a piece with other Aardman projects, not a breakthrough in form or content. But the cosy, period-piece story is sharpened by Karey Kirkpatrick's bright script. The wit is droll, heightened by the whistle-through-danger musical score. The throw-away references to other movies, plays and transatlantic cultural attitudes are a tickle. And the technique is remarkably fluid as ever. (One cackle an excellent clay-animation spit take.)The vocal talents are uniformly superior, from Mel Gibson playing the vain celebrity, to Miranda Richardson as the classically pinched villainess, Mrs. Tweedy. This excellence is the work of human actors who never feel the need to outshine their characters. It's also the work of Nick Park and his team, Englishmen who in the defiance of their national image, pay careful attention to the teeth of the matter.
