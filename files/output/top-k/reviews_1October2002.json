I have nothing but praise for this film, and it finally seems that Disney is back on track.  Whether or not they can keep it up remains to be seen, but Lilo and Stitch was worth every cent of admission and it will definitely be joining my DVD collection.The animation is beautifully done, though the animators aren't trying to dazzle your pants off - it was refreshing.  But what really stands out about this film is both the story and the cast of characters.  The story sucked me in right from the start and I was more than happy to go along for the ride.  This is thanks mostly to the characters.  They're all memorable and endearing creations, and for most of the film you will be cracking up in your seat at the onscreen antics.  While this film is aimed at kids (hello, Disney), don't let that put you off as adults will be just as entertained.  I was even surprised at a lot of the humor, it didn't seem so childish as you might expect.  That said, it's not all hilarity and comic capers, the film does tackle some deeper issues and at times it's touching.Two words.  See it.

Great fun in the living-room for a small be there group of people. But on the big screen? Very dull.I smiled 3 or 4 times watching this movie but I can't call it comedy. Sure. Steve has some great faces and the movie has some really good blue-screen jobs. I found myself trying to see when there was original actors and when there were new ones. A great job some of the time but the rest of the movie was really bad in my opinion. maybe I'd liked it more if I had watched with some friends and being doomsday drunk at the same time. But then anything would be funny.Summary I like some of Odekerks humour. I like some crazy-wire-superhero-kung-fu-movies like Iron Monkey and such.. but Kung Pow had none of this. just pointless silly talk.THUMBS down =( Better luck next time. 1 out of 10.

Everything about it was, quite literally of course, magical for me. The idea of a nanny as cool as Mary Poppins (a simply delightful Julie Andrews) coming to live with me, helping me clean up with a snap of the fingers, singing me to sleep with one of the loveliest voices known to the world, bringing me on adventures in sidewalk-painting lands and on rooftops at nightfall--it's small wonder that the songs and the story have stayed with me even over a couple of decades into (supposed!) adulthood. I just rewatched the film for the first time in at least ten (if not more) years, and it's still as fresh and funny as I remember it. My love for it hasn't been diminished by time; rather, my enjoyment of it as a child probably contributes to my renewed interest today. After all, I remember the penguins tap-dancing with Bert (Dick Van Dyke), the horses flying off the merry-go-round, Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn) laughing so hard he floats, the chimney sweeps dancing merrily over the rooftops and through the Banks house... it's incredible fun to relive and rewatch these scenes from my childhood.The entire film is fleshed out with songs galore, great ones from the justly ubiquitous 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' (whew!), the cheery 'A Spoonful Of Sugar' (sung as a meaningful reprise by Dick Van Dyke at the end), 'Chim-Chim-Cheree', 'Let's Go Fly A Kite', my personal favourite 'Feed The Birds (a simple, gorgeous, heart-rending song), and many more. You also couldn't get a better lead actress than Julie Andrews, who plays the stern, practically perfect Mary Poppins wonderfully--it's a shame that the last third of the film, in a hurry as it is to tie up the loose ends, neglects Mary somewhat (possibly my only complaint about the film) and goes on a little too long (the chimney sweep dance is charming for about half the length of time it goes on). But Andrews really is marvellous in the role, particularly in her final scene when she talks to her parrothead umbrella and we realise that, beneath all the sternness, she does love the children after all. But aside from that, her voice is stunning; she is radiant and well-deserving of her Academy Award (even given the MY FAIR LADY mess that cluttered the year's Oscars).MARY POPPINS had a great supporting cast as well. I mean, of course, the children (Karen Dotrice & Matthew Garber), Mr Banks (David Tomlinson) and the rest... but most especially Dick Van Dyke as Bert. Deplorable Cockney accent or no (and I wouldn't have known as a child, since I don't live in the UK and I thought it perfectly respectable--apparently I was wrong! g), he brings his long-legged, quirky charm to the role. Bert could really be quite an annoying character; Van Dyke makes him endearing. Another supporting character worthy of mention would be the special effects in the film--from the combination of live-action and cartoon, through to the smoke staircase, the magical folding clothes and opening doors, and the floating tea party. The story needed that touch of magic that only Disney could provide, and it was effective enough (and mostly stands up to scrutiny, even almost 40 years later) to help rather than hinder the overall charm of the film.Watching MARY POPPINS now as an adult, I can see the darker undertones to the film's message that I missed as a child, and in a way, I'm very glad I saw this film before I had the time to realise what was being suggested about society and patriarchy. The simple message, the one you should take from the film, is simply to be happy. To not forget that the biggest things in life are often the ones that we take for granted; that tuppence can be the smallest sum and the greatest joy to different people.

It is a classic example of movie-making at its finest.Technically the film is superb. Well filmed and with realistic sets, the viewer feels as if he really is on an 18th century British Navy vessel. I remember as a teenager coming across this movie halfway through and not really knowing what it was about but being captured by the vividly realistic portrayal of life at sea. That feeling has never gone away when I watch it. The performances are breath-taking. Clark Gable as Fletcher Christian and Franchot Tone as Roger Byam are excellent, but it is Charles Laughton as Bligh who steals the show. Everything about Laughton in this film screams Captain Bligh, and his is almost certainly the face that comes to mind when one contemplates the historical figure of Bligh. All three were nominated for Oscars, as was director Frank Lloyd (and inexplicably failed to win, although the film itself was named 1935's Best Picture.) The film mixes adventure, gripping drama and even humour into about two and a quarter hours of sheer enjoyment.You can quibble about a few things. Apparently history suggests that Bligh might not have been quite this sadistic nor Christian quite so noble. There's a strange shot of the Bounty being run aground by Christian at Pitcairn Island, and as the ship is about to crash into the island the film inexplicably reverses and the end of the shot is clearly going backward for about 2 seconds. I admit that it was passing strange that both Fletcher Christian and Roger Byam speak with American accents, making one wonder how these guys were in the British Navy (but for the sake of Gable's and Tone's performances that can be overlooked) and at the end the movie gets a bit preachy (particularly Byam's speech to his court-martial.)

It is a classic example of movie-making at its finest.Technically the film is superb. Well filmed and with realistic sets, the viewer feels as if he really is on an 18th century British Navy vessel. I remember as a teenager coming across this movie halfway through and not really knowing what it was about but being captured by the vividly realistic portrayal of life at sea. That feeling has never gone away when I watch it. The performances are breath-taking. Clark Gable as Fletcher Christian and Franchot Tone as Roger Byam are excellent, but it is Charles Laughton as Bligh who steals the show. Everything about Laughton in this film screams Captain Bligh, and his is almost certainly the face that comes to mind when one contemplates the historical figure of Bligh. All three were nominated for Oscars, as was director Frank Lloyd (and inexplicably failed to win, although the film itself was named 1935's Best Picture.) The film mixes adventure, gripping drama and even humour into about two and a quarter hours of sheer enjoyment.You can quibble about a few things. Apparently history suggests that Bligh might not have been quite this sadistic nor Christian quite so noble. There's a strange shot of the Bounty being run aground by Christian at Pitcairn Island, and as the ship is about to crash into the island the film inexplicably reverses and the end of the shot is clearly going backward for about 2 seconds.

From Mork & Mindy to Death To Smoochy, I enjoyed many pieces of Robin Williams' work. Fortunately for him, he was the savior in Death To Smoochy. I loved the cast, but it seems that all the funny scenes belonged to Robin Williams. That is not a bad thing. Robin is joined by Edward Norton and Catherine Keenan, two very good actors. Edward Norton was amusing and Catherine Keenan had a few lines that made me chuckle, but it was all Robin Williams who stole the show. If you really want a good laugh, check out the scene where Robin is being escorted out of the police station. You will die laughing!

George (Kevin Kline), the main character, experiences several hard-hitting changes to his life within a matter of days. The biggest change is that he doesn't have long to live. After a 4 day stay in the hospital contemplating this news, he takes charge of his life and sets about fixing some of the things that are broken in his life.(minor spoilers)The story shines best because it doesn't dwell on George's illness. We don't see any doctors or hospitals until the very end. Instead, we see George pushing his life, trying to better himself and the people his life touches. In re-establishing a relationship with his son and ex-wife, George discovers happiness in his life that had previously been only an unrealized potential. In parallel, the house he builds mirrors the emotional ties he mends. And we find ourselves captured by the positive energy that George is able to give to those around him.Missing is George's transition from simply meandering through life to taking charge of his life we see the results, but never gain insight into his character. We see George find out about his illness, and later see him full of purpose. The gap in between would have helped establish his motivation.Also missing is Sam's transition from rebelling from George to accepting him. This should have been a much bigger obstacle for the characters to tackle. Sam had stopped listening to his parents, having lost respect for them. He has installed a lock on the door to his room and refuses to answer their knock. He separates and distances himself from others. His prominent piercings and blue hair stand out against his more conservative classmates, who accuse him of being a 'freak'. Curiously, after ignoring other people, he listens to George after a brief 3 minute lecture, which initiates a change in his behavior. Unfortunately, this is out of character for Sam without some motivating factor.Kevin Kline does a decent job playing George. There are a several scenes where he appears to be too strong and in control for a person as sick as George, but this is minor. In one scene he is taking morphine for pain and is out of it so much that his speech is slurred. He raises his head off his pillow for a moment, but when he sets it down he displays a control that shouldn't be there.Hayden Christensen is well suited as Sam. I am convinced that if I were to meet him in person, I would dislike him for being that 'young with attitude' person he seems to be so good at playing (and I won't even mention Star Wars...). Hayden's character stumbles through a life which doesn't hold much purpose for him. Unfortunately, I haven't seen Hayden act any other way, so I can't tell if this is a skill or by accident. Perhaps they could have just flashed some more of his young, tight body on screen to make up for it. Another near-miss is Sam's uneven angst. He tells his family he wishes they would all go away and leave him alone. In other scenes, he talks about love, even though he has yet to find his first love in life.Several small sub-plots should have lived only long enough to make it to the cutting room floor, including the one involving Josh and Helene. Suffice it to say that they didn't add anything to the heart of the story, leaving the impression that they were simply tacked on to amuse bored viewers who couldn't handle the main plot.This movie doesn't fit the typical style of movie I tend to watch. This isn't because I am insensitive to emotional dramas, but rather that I am sensitized to images of death, having watched my brother die over a period of years.In closing, there were a lot of difficult, emotional things that the movie got right, and a lot of small things that were uneven and wrong. Overall, I enjoyed this movie and would watch it again.  ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"1 October 2002","score":"","review":"  Change seems to some in two extremes overwhelming and imperceptible.
