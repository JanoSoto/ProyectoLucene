If you haven't seen this movie, watch it either as Wes Anderson at the top of his form, or as a great introduction to his unique comic vision. Either way, it will reward you on multiple levels.

Being There is about the simple minded gardener named Chance, played by Sellers. When the owner of the estate that Chance has lived his entire life on dies, Chance is thrust out into the real world. Chance's life is changed when Eve Rand accidentally hits him with her car. Chance goes back to Eve's mansion where he meets he husband, a wealthy businessman, Ben Rand, who is dying of bone cancer. Rand has a close relationship to the president of the United States, giving Chance, who everybody now thinks is named Chauncey Gardiner because of a mumbled misunderstanding upon his and Eve's first encounter, a chance to meet the president. Chance's quips about gardening and television are mistaken for profound insight into economics and politics, making Chance a star in the political world. On the surface it is an easy going plot but it houses a lot of heartwarming sentiments as well as political satire that gives it a very brilliant and unique flare.It is difficult to come by a film as sweet and intelligent as this one. It is a very unique and charming experience that had a certain edge to it that I really enjoyed. It delivers a unique story with an assortment of very unique characters, especially Seller's portrayal of the protagonist, Chance. The film is a fantastically entertaining experience from start to finish. It is a very sincere and a very real film, that doesn't cheat its viewer by giving us what we expect or what we hope for. It casually draws itself out to a very wholehearted and well rounded experience. It is a very intelligently and diligently made film that stays true to what filmmaking is all about. The film displays a slow paced brilliance that is so captivating. It has it's laugh out loud moments that are so uniquely amusing, but then it also displays very sincere moments with a lot of heart. Being There is a very worthwhile film experience.This film's cast is possibly what drives it so well and keeps it so real and so alive. Peter Sellers pulls off the role of a lifetime as Chance the gardener. He is a very naive man, but is honestly more insightful and intelligent about the world in his own way than many people consider themselves to be. Everything he knows he's learned from television and, unknown to him, has learned to enjoy the finer and simpler things in life simply by not concerning himself with the larger troubles that surround the rest of us. The character is incredible and Seller's performance is top notch. The supporting cast reflect the rest of the world very well. Shirley MacLaine plays Eve, whose role is very important to the development of Chance and she does an excellent job. The strongest of the supporting roles is certainly Melvyn Douglas as the frail old Ben Rand. Douglas' role earned him an Oscar for best supporting actor, and watching his captivating performance alongside Sellers was proof that he deserved it. He delivers a very heartfelt performance and his character reflects the main themes of the film surrounding life and death and what we truly live for in our short lives.Being There is a magnificent film that makes you think without forcing anything down your throat. It tells a heartwarming story and it stays true to the themes it expresses throughout. Being There is a very honest and real film that was an absolute joy to watch. It is a movie that can be easily lost amongst all the other terrific films that came out in 1979, earning it the title of a hidden gem that you don't want to miss.

What do we think of at the mention of his name and how good he was at creating suspense? The sudden opening of a shower curtain, a succession of close-ups with dramatic orchestral music, a spiral staircase, stuff like that, right? Let's not forget what he could do with blind man and a truckload of circus performers complete with a bearded lady, Siamese twins and a dwarf. Being so mesmerized by his later work, we can easily forget that his ability make a Speed or Duel or French Connection kind of non-stop adrenaline rush may still be unparalleled.His version of that paring-down of the thriller genre to its bare elements is not gritty by any means, or even realistic. It's actually quite silly. What are the odds of encountering the aforementioned characters in a span of a few days, especially in as big a hurry as Kane, the plane factory worker falsely accused of sabotage in a desperate scramble for his life? But Saboteur is pure escape, catching us up in movie land.In essence, it's an American reworking of The 39 Steps, which is a superior film, perhaps solely on the grounds that this 1942 retooling is somewhat deluded by its forceful injection of wartime nationalistic propaganda. Thereis virtually nonstop talk of how Americans have backbone that will always make them the victors against scum like Otto Kruger, Norman Lloyd and Alan Baxter, who are particularly excellent as three smart, stylish and menacing men Kane must overcome. But altogether, The Master very seldom allows the pounding engine of his plot to in effect stop in its tracks for a soapbox diatribe, and is more often apt to work the propaganda Americana into situations wherein it works sardonically, such as when the circus act decides whether or not to alert the authorities to Kane by putting it to a vote and antagonizing the snarling dwarf who still protests despite the will of the majority. Fritz Lang submitted to WWII propaganda with his very clever Man Hunt, and like though perhaps more so than that 1941 actioner, Saboteur is a relentlessly thrilling picture that runs the risk of taking a modern audience out of the world of the story with blatant jingoistic contrivance, but maybe that is in itself a plus for modern-day movie buffs like myself, who as screen junkies are hyper-aware of the dangers of propaganda but simultaneously are fascinated by its nostalgic effect, that which causes our imaginations to enhance the feeling of escape with the fantasy of being in the old movie house with the cheering, guileless crowd, the celluloid whirring and flickering overhead and projecting magic on that screen.Indeed, one can imagine the enormous rush of excitement seeing this film at the time of its release, being engulfed by The Master's virtuosic technique like a roller-coaster ride, and what it must've been like at the onset of his American career and how it must've taken cinemas by storm. Although not one of the great film craftsman from Leytonstone's more charismatic leading men, Cummings is capable as the likable Kane. Lane is also good as the stronger-than-usual Hitchcock leading lady. But let's be honest, how much do performances matter in his films? A champion of the Russian montage, even when we're not enthralled by the performance itself as we are by Perkins in Psycho and Stewart or Day in The Man Who Knew Too Much, it's the craftsmanship of the editing and the rhythm that create the illusion of emoting in the faces of his actors. Such is the self-assured skill at work in a film like Saboteur.
