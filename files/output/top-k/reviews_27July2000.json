Despite that i decided to go see it and check for myself why the movie reviewers where praising this movie so much, rating it FIVE stars out of five.Unfortunately, in my country, (Portugal), this movie is playing only once a day in the early afternoons. As usual in Portugal, animation is treated all equal. Animated movies >little kids, and so this movie plays here in the few theaters that bought it (4 ), right about after lunch in little children time slot. What is realy amazing, is that i´m sure the Portuguese distributors of PRINCESS MONONOKE even saw the movie, because if they did, they would notice, (or perhaps not), that this is not a movie for little children. First because there are some very explicit gore scenes, where arms and heads are chopped off occasionally  along the whole movie, there´s violence (and i don´t mean just action violence), reference to more adult themes, (plenty of the female characters are ex-prostitutes) and a few more details like this.I don´t have any problem in taking any kid to see a story like this, but i´m sure there are a bunch of conservative parents out there, that by this time have just forbidden their kids of watching Pokemon, thinking that somehow Mangas are all the same.But PRINCESS MONONOKE isn´t a kids movie just because of this. Above all ,it´s because of its plot and storyline wich gets to complex for little kids to follow. One thing that amused me a lot, was watching some kids in the front row, totally confused because they couldn´t figure out who were the bad guys ! Others were totally bored and only paid real atention to the movie in the action scenes complaining all the time the movie was boring and not very easy to understand.In fact, actually, this movie has probably the best screenplay currently displayed in any movie right now. I wish i could find a non-animated movie out there at this moment with a screenplay capable of touching this one in quality and complexity. Not Mission Impossible for sure. ( And then it´s the animation films who are considered ,stuff for kids ! -) )I won´t get in the story of PRINCESS MONONOKE because part of pleasure of watching this movie, is going to see it without any clue whatsoever. I´m just going to say, it´s a very ecological movie, set in medieval china (i guess), and where spirits and anything magical, is treated like just another thing made by Mother Nature and not like some supernatural characters that we usualy find everywhere. There are no real heroes in here, and no real bad guy in sight. It´s a slow paced movie, with a brilliant animation, a very intimist plot, a little bit of crude violence (but depicted in a very natural way, not just there to show off), excelent characters, fantastic landscapes and a pretty good soundtrack that goes almost unoticed. And this movie is BIG. It´s not your regular 75\/80 minutes for kids. PRINCESS MONONOKE plays for about 130 minutes.If you like Manga, (and i don´t mean Dragon Ball), real Manga like AKIRA, or WINGS OF HONEAMISE, you can´t miss this movie, because it´s actualy a brilliant movie. Definetely one of the best this year. If you are a fan ,of an old Manga movie called WARRIORS OF THE WIND, then PRINCESS MONONOKE is from the same director, and the style is more or less the same.

And this was even more peculiar, because STIGMATA at first glance doesn´t look nothing more than just another big budget, hollywood, special effects, video clip, cool-style, extravaganza.And STIGMATA is all that, but this must be the first time in many years, where an extremely commercial movie, is supported not just by how many special effects it has, but actualy by a particulary excelent script, filled of real historical references about the theme it portraits, little bits of information on real cases of stigmata, and uses all that to serve a simple but excelent story, which in the end leaves us thinking and discussing about very interesting questions, like, - What is the need for a church as a human institution ? Was the church based on the will of a God or on the desire of Man ?  Why important gospels are not recognized by the Church ? And plenty of other interesting questions. In fact this movie raises so many important questions, that i´m surprised that it wasn´t condemned by the Church upon its release.Maybe the Church has learned its lesson with the LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST, when it ended up promoting Scorcese´s movie by condeming it, a few years ago. Or maybe the commercial nature of STIGMATA, pointed more to another END OF DAYS in wich Arnold Shwarzneger fighted the devil with machine guns and grenades. Could it be that everyone on the Church though that STIGMATA would be another innocent kids movie like that ? At least i did.I went to see this movie, completely convinced i was going just to have a nice time at the theater, eating my popcorns, watching a bad MTV rip-off of the EXORCIST and forget all about it later on.

Aparentely many people around me have had the same reaction as i did, because everybody was posing interesting questions. Suddenly it seemed that this wasn´t a special effects movie anymore. At least nobody seemed to care. Everybody was enjoying the story rather than everything else. It has been many years since i´ve experienced such an atmosphere while watching a movie in a theater, and that realy surprised me.While in MATRIX for example, wich has the same visual style, most people were commenting, how cool the movie was, (even if many of them were totaly confused about story) in STIGMATA people were more interested in the plot, than in the next special effect. I´m sure if we removed all those cool looks, MTV style, and action scenes, most people would  have left MATRIX after the first half complaining about it.

To me this makes STIGMATA a very good movie.And i don´t consider it as another EXORCIST rip-off, as this movie was attacked. It´s just another good movie about possesion, and with a better plot than the Exorcist as far as i´m concerned. The Exorcist, didn´t made me think. STIGMATA may be the 90´s equivalent to an EXORCIST, but it´s definetely NOT a rip-off.I like the visual style, the photography is very atmospheric and with original touches, the plot is great, the action is impressive, nice special effects, (altough the computer flames are crap (as ususal) ), it´s very well directed, it´s not just another hollywood blockbuster for braindeads, it has excelent characters, excelent performances by the actors, particulary the leads and overall it poses questions to a general audience that i think everybody should pay more atention to.Oh, and i´m sure the church, might not like this movie very much, which is always a good sign that a movie is a good one. -)If you can, buy the DVD because it´s exelent, and the director´s commentary is filled of great details about the making of the movie.

It's understandable because if you're not to it, the constant terror, haunting sound effects, scary photography (from the forest creature's point of view), and bathtubs full of blood and other gore that occupy the screen for 75% of the duration will put you off if not sicken you beyond belief.

I was about 6 or 7 years at the time, and i remember that you only could get in to see this movie, if you were older than 18, (like in ALIEN). Anyone younger than 19 wasn´t allowed in the theater, ( i remember watching people with their ID cards, buying tickets). Each time i looked at that JAWS poster i got extremely curious, but i knew that i would be real afraid of watching it.How things change. Now we look at JAWS and i´m sure now that it´s re-released in DVD for it´s 25th aniversary, with a 15 certificate, only because it´s the politicaly correct classification, because if it wasn´t for that i bet it would get a PG certificate at the most, such is the lightness of those now famous gore scenes that seemed too creepy so many adult people back in the 70´s.I don´t know if there is anyone on this movie-planet that hasn´t seen JAWS yet, but i´m speaking for those very few of you, who are still afraid. JAWS it´s NOT an horror movie, it´s an ADVENTURE movie set at sea !JAWS has less gore than any INDIANA JONES !In fact, i remember how disappointed i got ,when i saw it for the first time. After all those horror expectations from when i was a kid, JAWS turned out to be a very regular light adventure movie instead. I even thought i watched a cutted version of the movie, because i was expecting to see people getting eaten to pieces on screen and it was nothing like that. Instead of a gore movie, i got an adventure with great, positive and funny characters. Hey, i could have watched this movie when i was a kid and not get much frightened ! -)After my inital disappointment, i watched JAWS plenty of other times, and each time it grew on me a little more. Perhaps because i love the sea and this remains one of the best sea movies of all time. Right now what i find trully amazing in JAWS is the way in which fools the viewer into thinking he has seen more violence and gore than what actualy shows. To me this is the great achievment in this picture. I read somewhere that Spielberg´s initial intention was to show lots more of the shark, but he had no budget and the rubber shark looked fake, so he decided to create suspanse instead of visuals.Thank all gods that this movie was made in the 70´s, because if it was today, i´m sure it would only become another hollywood blockbuster filled with special effects, and a big pretty computer generated shark chewing on everybody. In fact i guess Spielberg did this modern JAWS, it´s called  JURASSIC PARK and LOST WORLD, which are a pretty good example of how lots of special effects can make a boring and empty movie, specialy if you see it more than once. I can bet, no one will release a 25th anniversary edition of JURASSIC PARK years from now.So once again it´s proved that lack of money equals imagination. JAWS looks so great because of it. If you haven´t seen it yet, you don´t know what you´re missing. Go see it, rent it, or buy the new incredible DVD 25th anniversary edition which has lots of extra stuff, including a 50 minute making off.And watch it with your kids, so they can see how chicken their parents were, for being affraid of going to see a movie that nowadays could be screened in a kids matineé.

I felt, well, as tortured as the characters in the film.The storyline revolves around a man, a woman and a ghost. Michelle Pfeiffer, who plays both woman and ghost, lives with Harrison Ford, who plays the both man and husband, in a house that tried to play on my nerves, but failed. Michelle Pfeiffer's character is haunted simultaneously by Harrison Ford's character's dead ex-wife and by some innate form of acting inability.

This movie is probably one of the greatest modern-day fantasies I've seen, due primarily to the amazing vision of Gilliam.  I was disappointed with it on my first viewing years ago, expecting a rehash of Monty Python material, but yesterday watching it I just couldn't stop grinning.  This movie knows its sources, and sends them up right.For starters, I love how Gilliam handled the boy 'hero' in Bandits.  He's not anyone spectacular, aside from an active imagination (over and above his banal parents), and he really doesn't contribute much to the story-it simply passes him by.  Most of the other characters don't like him that much even. (the stinking Kevin line just makes me howl!) He's also not that cute, which is a rarity with child actors and which sinks most films with them.  Plus, the danger of the story doesn't stop at him, as shown by the rather sobering finale.  No 'It's all a dream' type cop-out here.  Having studied the form of the fantasy as explained by Tolkien myself, Gilliam obviously understands how it works.Of course, because it works, Time Bandits is just plain fun.  The plot's out of nowhere-just kind of trips along through time and space and stranger things.  Napoleon as a height-obsessed drunkard?  Robin Hood as the aloof, unlikely leader of a band of violent, too-merry men?  Agamemnon as the ideal father figure?  It's all here, plus the technocratic, pyromaniac Evil vs. the Supreme Being.  Ah, you always knew He was an staid Englishman in a pinstripe suit, didn't you?  (Dead?  No excuse for laying off work.)Perhaps it's not Gilliam's masterpiece, as Brazil could be argued for that...though one could also argue Time Bandits gives a bleaker perspective through the contrast of the fun and whimsy.

From A Few Good Men (1992) to When Harry Met Sally (1989) to Ghosts of Mississippi (1996), he does not seem to concentrate on one movie genre.  My favorite Rob Reiner movie is without a doubt A Few Good Men (1992) and now, a close second is Stand By Me (1986) which has absolutely no link or resemblance with his other movies.There is no kid who wouldn't be intrigued at the opportunity of seeing a dead human body.  He would be even more intrigued if seeing that dead body involved a two-day trip with your best buddies and sneaking behind your parents' backs.  In these kinds of situations, reason seems to escape a child and excitement takes over.  This is at the center of the script of the movie.  There is a second part which is not as visible at first, but when you come to think of it, it is the most important part of the script.  This second part is courage.  Courage of accomplishing a dream, courage of facing the truth, and courage of standing by one another.  This kind of courage is what allows us to determine which of the four boys is the movie's hero.Four boys, Gordie (Wil Wheaton), Chris (River Phoenix), Teddy (Corey Feldman), and Vern (Jerry O'Connell) decide to go searching for the dead body of a young boy their age named Ray Brower.We find out that Gordie had a brother, Dennis (John Cusack) who was killed in a jeep accident quite recently and  was very close to Gordie.  In fact, Dennis plays a major part in Gordie's trip.  It seems that all four boys have something that allows them to be in a class of their own.  Gordie had his brother to whom he looked up to and who loved him.  Chris is a kid who comes from a bad family and has inevitably turned out bad as well.  He also has an older brother who everyone calls Eyeball (Bradley Gregg) and has become a total bum.  Teddy's father was in the second World War and stormed the beach of Normandy, a fact of which Teddy is very proud.  But his father turned bad after his return and nearly killed his son by putting his ear to a stove.  His father was then sent to a mental institution.  Finally, we have Vern.  The only standout characteristic Vern has is that he had buried a jar of pennies under his porch and his mother accidentally threw away the map he had drawn for it.So these four kids are somewhat special and get along great.  But there is another bunch of kids in the movie.  The bad bunch.  This bunch includes Chris's big brother Eyeball, Vern's big brother Billy (Casey Siemaszko), his friend Charlie Hogan (Gary Riley), two other guys whose names are unknown to the viewer and finally, a seventh one who turns out to be the gang leader, a kid who everyone calls Ace (Kiefer Sutherland).  Apart from being the gang leader, Ace is also the craziest and most dangerous kid in that gang.The important part of the story is how Vern learns about the dead body. As he was looking for his pennies under the porch, he overheard his brother Billy and Charlie discussing how they found the body after having stolen a car and gone for a ride in the woods where the dead boy's body was. However, the two boys finally tell Ace and Eyeball about the body and the whole gang decide to go looking for him to become famous.  But the young boys are also in the woods and this is where things get very tricky and almost deadly.The all-star cast is probably the best part of the movie.  River Phoenix is probably the one who gives the best performance as Chris Chambers, the young boy who turns out to be, at least in my mind, the movie's hero.  A close second in the acting category is Kiefer Sutherland who is absolutely abominable as Ace.  There are two great scenes in which Phoenix and Sutherland confront each other showing Chris's gift to be able to stand up for his friends and defend them and Ace's personality which is pretty much to take no crap off anyone and be as big a bully as possible.

This wouldn't have been so bad, however, if the movie had continued being a comedy, since that's all it deserved to be. But instead, they had the arrogance to try to teach the audience a moral about how superficial and meaningless life is, as if we didn't know. The last half is painfully preachy and obvious, and the lines about all the beauty in this world are laughable. I do recommend seeing the first hour, though- Spacey is pretty funny.

Then in walks Wallace as a neophyte cop, the first white man ever to work in this all-Asian department.  The question then becomes  is this new officer (Mark Wahlberg) as corrupt as Nick or is there a secret hidden behind his façade of `green' newcomer?Actually, the story of the film emerges as more interesting in cold print than it does in its final cinematic form. As written by Robert Pucci and directed by James Foley, the film, particularly in its early stages, verges practically on the incomprehensible.  This is partly due to the fact that the thick accents of virtually the entire cast render much of the dialogue indecipherable (and Wahlberg is not a heck of a lot better on that score in all honesty).  One almost wishes that the entire film (rather than just a few brief snippets) could have been translated with subtitles.  Adding to the incoherence is the astonishing profusion of characters hurled our way almost from the very beginning.  We spend much of the film just trying to figure out who is who, how each person is related to the others, exactly how many gangs are involved in the proceedings and what exactly it is they are all after.Luckily, about halfway into the film, the elements begin to jell a bit and the interest level increases ever so slightly as the two principal characters begin to discover truths about each other initially held back from both them and us.  Even here, though, the film actually treads over ground that was explored to far greater effectiveness in `Donnie Brasco' a few years back.  That earlier movie, however, was considerably more intrigued by the moral complexities of its situations and characters than `The Corruptor,' with its weak and uninspired screenplay, ever manages to be.   For the most part, this film is executed like a standard issue cops-and-robbers shoot-em-up, filled with mediocre car chases and poorly staged gun battles.  The filmmakers simply don't have the intellectual where-with-all to cope with the ethical issues they want so desperately to explore.It's highly unlikely that even the most die-hard action movie fan will be particularly impressed with this tepid genre entry.  The saddest aspect of the film is watching the talented Mark Wahlberg (who has scored most effectively in the past when appearing in more serious, non-blockbuster roles and films) as he continues his unsuccessful attempt to secure a place as a sure-fired draw at the movie box office.  The best advice to Wahlberg may be to simply stop trying to be a star and concentrate on being an actor.

Now I can appreciate that this film has more to offer than its face value, as the adventures of a forgotten, mythical hero. Firstly, simplisticly, Gilliam was clearly well read and very aware of several literary influences which played an important role in his film. For example, in the series of scenes surrounding Vulcan and Venus, I believe Gilliam draws a great deal from Virgil's 'Aenied VIII', in which the mythical figures Venus seduces Vulcan to create a special shield for Aeneas, an event which illustrates Vulcan's weakness with his wife's strong sexuality. But, more importantly, Gilliam addresses the theme of imagination, in a Romantic\/Keatsian way, which contrasts the ideas of imagination versus reality, the conflict of which results in the victory of Munchausen, who respresents the strength of the imagination, and his death confirms that all things, including the imagination, are subject to mortality.All is tied up with Python-esque humour, and with the wonderful appearances of Eric Idle, Robin Williams, and several other marvellous actors, this film is truly an underrated and delightful cinematic thrill.
