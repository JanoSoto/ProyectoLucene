Die hard 'Silence of the Lambs' fans had waited ten years for a sequel, and no doubt they expected a comparable film in terms of genre and tone. Afterall, if you're looking for a really creepy film, look no further than Lecter's 1991 exploits.  The name itself is synonymous with 'horror' to most people concerned.Enter Ridley Scott's take on 'Hannibal,' and the audience is introduced to a very different film.  Lecter is no longer imprisoned, and thus no longer bitter.  He is free to enjoy the finer things in life, with a little cannibalism on the side.  The audience must understand that Lecter is not a psychopathic killer.  He has better manners than the lot of you combined, and will only be truly terrifyingly ruthless when he is backed into a corner.  Did you expect a horror movie with a newly-freed Hannibal Lecter?'Hannibal' is a love story.  The beautiful cinematography and glorious musical score from Hans Zimmer should cue you in to this change of tone. This film--often very mellow--flows like water from beginning to end. The script is filled with memorable dialogue.  For a sample, jump on over to imdb's memorable quotes.  Tossed and turned into one package, all of these elements mold a film that is truly wonderful to behold.And every now and then (especially towards the end of the film) 'gruesome' is the order of the day.  Needn't I spoil these moments for you.  You will be disturbed.  However, the violence never overwhelms the story and the character development.  Even after the film's most disturbing moment (you know), we are treated to a very touching moment that, in my mind, overshadows the violence it proceeded.What we are left with is a very unique film--a combination of a twisted love story, and twisted violence.  And it is too elegantly done not to like.Dismiss all expectations and let 'Hannibal' work its magic.

This has two, folded into one.The most obvious is Jack. This is how young Nicholson acts when he is unconstrained. More precisely, this is the fullness of his acting style when he has it on his own terms. Jack's talent is that he understands the envelope of stage self, and how to place his presence in relationship to that shell. Sometimes he is inside, doing his `internal' acting bit, similar to what most others do. But once in a while, he shifts to an external presence where his being is mostly outside his skin. We usually notice this when he is energetic or right after he has performed one of his violent shifts between inside and out. The only other actor I know who does this is Toshiro Mifune, someone known for the agility of this move, but he always signals the switch. Jack doesn't; in fact he more often sneaks into this external mode after convincing us that such shifts are always violent. The result is extraordinarily offputting and effective because we can never be sure who is watching who.The master of this (performance-perspective) shifting trick is Chopin, who is the real star of this project. Chopin developed this notion of imagination-then-performance mapped to and inside-versus-outside the vehicle. In Chopin's case, it is a matter of creating a supposed focus in the tune, how it begins a direction and then unexpectedly doubles back, or comments on itself, or goes in a completely unexpected apparently unrelated direction - all this much like Garrison Keillor's storytelling. That's the disguise, because while you are paying attention to that, he has designed the music in such a way that the performer (if so skilled) can subtly shift outside the music by a technique of rubato, which is a parallel thread of moving `in' and `out' of the being of the piece.Strictly speaking, rubato is a matter of moving slightly before and after the beat independent of the phrasing. Its a metaphysical contact with the listener that can be life-altering, especially if the same performer has diverted your attention elsewhere. Rubinstein was this sort of master performer of Chopin. The central element of this story is a Chopin piece played by `Bobby!' Ostensibly he is playing the `easiest' one he knows as if he were eight. The listener is impressed with the `feeling' that Bobby claims isn't there. (Bergman's later `Autumn Sonota' does the reverse, also with Chopin.)It is a remarkable construction to so fold the story.

The newly arrived couple seem to have some problems. But she not only has to deal with that, she also starts thinking the house she and her husband, Norman (Harrison Ford), live in, is haunted.One of the characters sums up the movie best with the line, Not much happening.There are some really poorly written lines. For instance, when Norman wants to make love with his wife he says, Wanna fool around. Wanna fool around?!! Groan.This movie has no rhythm to it. And the performances are quite lacking in any real emotion.Too often the movie relies on cheap thrills, such as bouts of silence before a loud phone ringing or people creeping up out of nowhere. There never is any real tension or suspense.A movie can't be scary or thrilling when the twist can be seen miles away. The trailer even practically gives the whole story away. Do Hollywood really think we are this stupid? It seems so.*** POSSIBLE SPOILER ***And what is with the first mystery?

","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family"},{"date":"1 June 2003","score":"6 out of 13 people found the following review useful","review":"  If the third Alien film didn't convince you that the series has passed its expiration date, Alien Resurrection surely will. While I must admit that this film is not altogether bad, and a big improvement over the third, it is in no way as good as its original two predecessors, and it is quite obvious from the establishing shots to the last.The first two films were excellent, but the third film was one major flop, due to horrible characters, unintelligably fast camera movement, and, for me, the idea of all hope in the second film fading. (Ripley risks her life many times to save Newt in Aliens, but then in a quick moment in the third, she (Newt) is dead? That's not right.)The thing that made the first two films superb was not only the tension and white-knuckle terror, but the cinematography (which won an Oscar for the original film), and the creatures, who were never quite shown to the extent anyone would like, including in the first film. And then the third film came along and showed the aliens' full bodies, and due to average CGI, the fear diminished. In this new installment, aliens hop along, walk upright, leap on people; heck, they even swim. But the visual effects on the creatures is so poor for a 1997 film that it makes one want to wipe the film from their memory. It ruins the original two Alien films. The aliens in this film look more like tiny lizards with heads shaped as melons than anything. Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986) showed the aliens from the waist up much of the time, and the creatures looked like men in alien suits. Which, in this case--believe it or not, is better. I like the hokey costumes; the creatures seem more terrifying when they hover above humans and move like humans. But alas, in Resurrection they move about like quick little...well...typical aliens, and the creatures are no longer original, but misused.The plot in Resurrection--what little of it there is--opened my eyes to the meaning of contrived, simple and stereoytpical. The plot is so incredibly weak that one cannot take their eyes off the screen. Here it is in simple terms, cutting out the BS in between A ship with crewmembers lands at a bigger ship, where they are transporting cargo. Bigger Ship will be referred to as Medical Ship, where they are conducting evil, B-science-fiction experiments on--whaddaya know--the old xenamorphs, commonly referred to as aliens. These aliens trace back to Ellen Ripley. 200 years ago Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) died (see Alien3), and now they have cloned her to get the alien that was inside her.

While I must admit that this film is not altogether bad, and a big improvement over the third, it is in no way as good as its original two predecessors, and it is quite obvious from the establishing shots to the last.The first two films were excellent, but the third film was one major flop, due to horrible characters, unintelligably fast camera movement, and, for me, the idea of all hope in the second film fading. (Ripley risks her life many times to save Newt in Aliens, but then in a quick moment in the third, she (Newt) is dead? That's not right.)The thing that made the first two films superb was not only the tension and white-knuckle terror, but the cinematography (which won an Oscar for the original film), and the creatures, who were never quite shown to the extent anyone would like, including in the first film. And then the third film came along and showed the aliens' full bodies, and due to average CGI, the fear diminished. In this new installment, aliens hop along, walk upright, leap on people; heck, they even swim. But the visual effects on the creatures is so poor for a 1997 film that it makes one want to wipe the film from their memory. It ruins the original two Alien films. The aliens in this film look more like tiny lizards with heads shaped as melons than anything. Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986) showed the aliens from the waist up much of the time, and the creatures looked like men in alien suits. Which, in this case--believe it or not, is better. I like the hokey costumes; the creatures seem more terrifying when they hover above humans and move like humans. But alas, in Resurrection they move about like quick little...well...typical aliens, and the creatures are no longer original, but misused.The plot in Resurrection--what little of it there is--opened my eyes to the meaning of contrived, simple and stereoytpical.

Its too bad the film did not do well at the boxoffice, because now all we will get in the future is more stupid car chases, more crude bathroom humor, and more phony CGI special effects.

Sure it is not fast paced...and it is very corny at times...but it has one of the best casts I've seen in a long time...and it has what all those hit films of today often lack  HEART.  I love this film.  It is a keeper.  Like It's a Wonderful Life it will develop an audience as the years pass and others discover it.  I wish I had seen it in the theater, but I was put off by all the negative reviews.  Shame on me. Its too bad the film did not do well at the boxoffice, because now all we will get in the future is more stupid car chases, more crude bathroom humor, and more phony CGI special effects.  What we won't get is intelligent films that can make us cry, laugh, and root for the characters.  Thank you Mr. Carrey for this film.  You and the cast were terrific.  I will enjoy this film for many many years to come.

I've seen most of Capra's films, and they are usually about idealism, decency, & innocence, with a huge helping of cornball thrown in...exactly what The Majestic has.

The language of the book, and the emotion highs and lows the author takes us through are unmatched. The fact it was his first book in English makes it even more amazing. Transferring any book to film generally loses something in the translation, and this one is no different. The 1962 Kubrick version both benefitted and suffered from Peter Sellers as Quilty. He was a great actor and his performance was the best thing about that movie, but his character was way off base compared to the novel. James Mason was good but seemed a bit old. Shelley Winters was good. Sue Lyon was OK, but a bit too mature, I think. This version also was heavily sanitized (though it had a few minor points of symbolizm - the peach and banana, etc), and in fact the characters never kiss. Also missing from the early movie is most of the 27,000 miles of traveling the couple went through - so much so that HH frequently confused the motel names. I did like the movie as its own thing, but it bears slight resemblance to the book. Now to the 1997 movie... Jeremy Irons seemed perfect as HH, and Dominique Swain was darn good as Lo.However, Melanie Griffith was just irritating and shrill as Charlotte, and bore no resemblance to what HH summarily described as ...that sorry and dull thing a handsome woman.SPOILERS AHEAD TO THE ENDAlthough I appreciated the scenes of HH and Anabelle (missing in the early movie) because it gives much insight to HH's obsession, I felt that there should have been some mention of Valeria, his wife before meeting Lolita, and Rita, his adult lover after Lolita abandons him. I thought it needed more voice-overs from the book. Particularly during the first night at the Enchanted Hunters - the culmination of fate and HH's plans - it could have been used to get a deeper feeling of his internal mental struggle - I had the odious feeling that little Dolores was wide awake and would explode in screams if I touched her with any part of my wretchedness, and then later ...and less than 6 inches from me and my burning life, was nebulous Lolita! Also, his depression after Lolita abandons him did not feel as strong as in the book, and some more voice-over could have helped there. I would have loved to see HH tape that good-bye note to Rita's navel when he leaves her to track down Lo after getting Lo's letter. Although Rita is somewhat of a rebound for him she does give him needed companionship, and the fact that he drops her immediately with not much regret only reinforces that fact he is hopelessly in love with Lolita. The biggest problem I have with either movie is the ending. The last page or two is possibly the most emotionally moving in the book. HH explains his reason for writing the book - ...I thought I would use these notes in toto at my trial, to save not my head, of course, but my soul. He expects Lolita to have a long and happy life and gives her some sound words of advice, then we are informed that if we are reading the book then Lolita is dead. It culminates with this...And do not pitu C.Q. One had to choose between him and H.H., and one wanted H.H. to exist at least a couple of months longer, so as to have him make you live in the minds of later generations. I am thinking of aurochs and angels, the secret of durable pigments, prophetic sonnets, the refuge of art. And this is the only immortality you and I may share, my Lolita. This could and should have been included in a simple prison cell scene at the end. His subsequent death could easily be shown, too. Why resort to the cheap and easy text on the screen? I give the 1997 movie 9 stars. If you want the real deal - read the book, which gets 100 stars.
