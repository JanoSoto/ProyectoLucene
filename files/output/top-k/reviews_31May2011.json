But if you can see the character beyond the actor then you're most likely going to enjoy the performance a lot more.Seymour Parrish works in the one hour photo processing department of the SavMart store. He has worked there for many years and has seen many customers come and go, but one family, the Yorkin's have been coming back for ten years. They are Nina and Will and their nine year old son Jakob. Unfortunately for them, Seymour, or Sy as he prefers to be called, has become very attached to them through their photos over the years. So much so that he even fantasises about being a member of this perfect family. After an unfortunate event at work and while processing some photos Sy discovers that the Yorkin's are not as perfect as he imagined. As you can probably imagine, this does not go down too well with Sy. I won't say any more so as not to give any spoilers.A really well made film that I found quite atmospheric in places. A great performance from Robin Williams as Seymour Parrish, I really felt he nailed the part! Also worthy of note were; Connie Nielsen as Nina Yorkin, Michael Vartan as Will Yorkin, Dylan Smith as Jakob Yorkin, Erin Daniels as Maya Burson and Gary Cole as Bill Owens.There is a really great commentary all about photographs and what they mean to people that follows through the first two thirds of the film. It is read by Robin Williams as Sy and it really adds character to the film. Although not perfect, I did really enjoy this film and in particular Robin William's performance.

Robert Redford and Paul Newman who paired in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid form a wonderful duo, with a priceless interaction between the apprentice and the mentor. Indeed, the kind of con they're going to pull is a whole artistic accomplishment with a quite pedagogic value, illustrated by all the chapters that structure the film like so many necessary steps to make the perfect sting.

It's intelligent in the literal meaning of the world as we really understand what it's about, and intelligent, as it honors men of intelligence. This is the appeal of The Sting. Beyond the setting, the characters, the music, there's the pleasure of admiring how fooling someone can be an art that requires a perfect timing, many psychological talents, and I'm saying art and not science, because of the human factor. Of course, the movie's general mood is positive and cheerful as we forget these guys are 'criminal', but like the other movie that won the Best Picture Oscar one year before, it's 'good criminals vs. bad criminals'. It works despite Robert Shaw's sweet ability to portray Doyle Lonnegan and inspire us empathy, except in the beginning where he sentenced two men to death, without even knowing them.

One of them is A. Tarkovsky &#x96; a true auteur and genius who made 7 films that are considered to be masterpieces (another is the author of the reviews title). Among these films brightly shines a science fiction mystery Solaris. It is a breathtaking story about a man's journey to cosmos to seek knowledge about an alien intelligence and more importantly to understand himself and the nature of the humankind. The main stars of the movie are Lithuanian D. Banionis, Estonian J. Järvet and Russians A. Solonitsyn and N. Bondarchuk.Solaris is known for its slow and gradual prelude. Prelude lasts for 40 minutes and takes place on Earth. During it, we are introduced to the main character &#x96; psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) who is shown as a profound person tormented by his own thoughts. He agrees to go on a mission to a base established near a planet that appears to have some kind of intelligence on it. At first Kelvin seems to be skeptical about it but his approach radically changes when he comes on the base and meets members of the crew Dr. Snaut (Juri Jarvet), Dr. Sartorius (Anatoli Solonitsyn) and Dr. Gibarian (Sos Sargsyan). They are acting very bizarre and soon Kelvin finds out the reason of this strange behavior. He realizes that the planet is able to materialize people's thoughts. Kelvin tries to understand what does the planet wants from them, what makes human a human and many others scientific, moral and philosophical problems.A. Tarkovsky's masterpiece has to be watched more than just one time because of its complex themes and problems. Solaris complexity is the reason why this movie stands out of all science fiction movies and is timeless. It tries to make viewers think about the human kind and invites to an open debate about the deepest feelings and fears of humans. Film also deals with the theme of remorse and the problem of not being capable to escape from your own thoughts. Quotes of L. Tolstoy are citied on more than one occasion and there are some references to Don Quixote written by M. Cervantes. Moreover, the whole story can be seen as an attempt of humankind to understand and to be understood by the higher intelligence (or even God if you want to name it).Another thing that makes this movie so special is its visual beauty and eerie mood. No matter where the action is taking place or if it is filmed in color of B\/W it is still stunning. A. Tarkovsky manages to show the beauty of countryside (prelude), city (ride on streets of the future Moscow) and science fiction features (from the design of the base to the magnificent ocean of the planet) in the same movie. Even though the film is visually beautiful, the viewer is not always able to relax and admire it. This is because A. Tarkovsky attains so paranoid and eerie mood that it makes some parts of the movie look like scenes from a horror movie. He achieves it with the help of haunting composition of J. S. Bach (Ich ruf' zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ) which becomes the movie score.To sum up, Solaris is a thought provoking masterpiece that has an overwhelming visuals and a haunting score. It is not designed for a regular viewer and Tarkovsky expects a lot of wisdom from his viewer. However, I consider Solaris to be one of the best science fiction movies ever made and I believe that it should be viewed by every self-respected movie buff at least twice.2011-05-31 ","genre":null},{"date":"31 May 2011","score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" There are only two film directors in the world whose every movie haunts me and causes insomnia every time I watch it.

Tolstoy are citied on more than one occasion and there are some references to Don Quixote written by M. Cervantes. Moreover, the whole story can be seen as an attempt of humankind to understand and to be understood by the higher intelligence (or even God if you want to name it).Another thing that makes this movie so special is its visual beauty and eerie mood. No matter where the action is taking place or if it is filmed in color of B\/W it is still stunning. A. Tarkovsky manages to show the beauty of countryside (prelude), city (ride on streets of the future Moscow) and science fiction features (from the design of the base to the magnificent ocean of the planet) in the same movie. Even though the film is visually beautiful, the viewer is not always able to relax and admire it. This is because A. Tarkovsky attains so paranoid and eerie mood that it makes some parts of the movie look like scenes from a horror movie. He achieves it with the help of haunting composition of J. S. Bach (Ich ruf' zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ) which becomes the movie score.To sum up, Solaris is a thought provoking masterpiece that has an overwhelming visuals and a haunting score. It is not designed for a regular viewer and Tarkovsky expects a lot of wisdom from his viewer. However, I consider Solaris to be one of the best science fiction movies ever made and I believe that it should be viewed by every self-respected movie buff at least twice.2011-05-31 ","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"31 May 2011","score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" There are only two film directors in the world whose every movie haunts me and causes insomnia every time I watch it. One of them is A. Tarkovsky &#x96; a true auteur and genius who made 7 films that are considered to be masterpieces (another is the author of the reviews title). Among these films brightly shines a science fiction mystery Solaris. It is a breathtaking story about a man's journey to cosmos to seek knowledge about an alien intelligence and more importantly to understand himself and the nature of the humankind. The main stars of the movie are Lithuanian D. Banionis, Estonian J. Järvet and Russians A. Solonitsyn and N. Bondarchuk.Solaris is known for its slow and gradual prelude. Prelude lasts for 40 minutes and takes place on Earth. During it, we are introduced to the main character &#x96; psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) who is shown as a profound person tormented by his own thoughts. He agrees to go on a mission to a base established near a planet that appears to have some kind of intelligence on it. At first Kelvin seems to be skeptical about it but his approach radically changes when he comes on the base and meets members of the crew Dr. Snaut (Juri Jarvet), Dr. Sartorius (Anatoli Solonitsyn) and Dr. Gibarian (Sos Sargsyan). They are acting very bizarre and soon Kelvin finds out the reason of this strange behavior. He realizes that the planet is able to materialize people's thoughts. Kelvin tries to understand what does the planet wants from them, what makes human a human and many others scientific, moral and philosophical problems.A. Tarkovsky's masterpiece has to be watched more than just one time because of its complex themes and problems. Solaris complexity is the reason why this movie stands out of all science fiction movies and is timeless. It tries to make viewers think about the human kind and invites to an open debate about the deepest feelings and fears of humans. Film also deals with the theme of remorse and the problem of not being capable to escape from your own thoughts. Quotes of L.

This is a movie that has made one of the strongest impressions on me, one that for many years I remembered as the best one I had ever seen. Strangely enough, the scene that touched my imagination the most was that of of Lee Van Cleef standing there, smoking a cigarette. Maybe it was just a budding 6th sense, but somehow I felt--if only subconsciously&#x97;that I was watching the birth of a Western legend. An impression that Serge Leone seems to have shared too, as it prompted him to sign him up.I saw HN again a few years ago and, while still impressing me, it left me with a lingering, uncomfortable feeling. Something was amiss; I just couldn't put the finger on it. Now, after reading these reviews I've found one giving me the insight I was looking for. See, Kane is not the typical fearless hero who willingly confronts a gang of outlaws because of self imposed moral duty, but just a poor man terrified at the idea of being killed. Just check his deer-caught-in-headlights eyes when confronted to Ben Miller. Why didn't he arrested him on the spot, for vagrancy? What's your business in town, punk?. Remember, this is the Marshall who cleaned up the city.So, why the myth has subsisted for so long...? The answer lies, I think, in the wrong impression we get at a given moment. See, when Kane runs away and then turns back, the reason he gives is that Miller will catch up with him anyway and in open range he'll be dead meat. So, is better to confront him in town. Now, up to that point we have been led to believe that the whole town is behind him&#x97;except for an ambiguously exultant bartender--and that Miller won't know where to find him, so at that moment his act seems bound mostly by principle. Only later we realize that Miller has friends in town, so Kane wasn't giving an excuse after all; he was just telling the truth. Had not turned back then he would have been killed in a few hours. The said review has a point too when it states that when the mayor tells him to run away, in church, Kane should have answered that that's exactly what he did, but then he realized they would catch up with him anyway so here he is, pleading for help. There is another way to prove he is a desperate man. Those who through History have willingly faced inevitable deaths have showed in their final moment unique calm & detachment. The case of Allende comes to mind, as his last words were actually recorded; they show him composed, in peace with himself. Had Kane been the hero he has been made, he would have never acted the way he does, but taken instead a more Eastwood-esque poise, showing defiance and fortitude faced to danger, not fear. That's why Kane is so touching he is too vulnerable, too scared. It's our compassion he awakens, not our sympathy. (The fact that he begs for help to an old man with busted knuckles show also how desperate he is).But if Kane is not representing the typical Western hero, then who? Err, how about the persecuted Jews of Europe? If we make this assumption we'll see everything falling into place. The townspeople would be Gentiles who don't give a hoot about the persecuted, who have only one word of advice for him run for your life. The Miller Gang would be the Nazis. Kane was fighting a losing battle and in the end he should have been killed. But we're in Hollywood, a happy end is mandatory. Good must prevail. So, against all logics, Kane wins. It is that end twist which subverts the story and causes much confusion, making us take Kane for an All American hero instead of for what he really was a desperate man. But Good Ole Duke knew his onions; he didn't fall for it when calling it Un-American.The said reviewer makes other valid points too that the HUAC metaphor is irrelevant and that real time action gimmicks wear off fast. But I disagree on the contradiction he sees in Ramirez' behavior--she's scared of Miller but then she looks him right in the eye in the station. Actually she is not fleeing because of fear of Miller but because she doesn't want to be there when Kane is killed. That's why she accompanies Amy, as she sees them both now as sisters in widowhood. Also, Amy is not disloyal; she just sees Kane as obstinate, not understanding at all the situation. One thing I haven't seen yet mentioned in any review, though, is that Miller's return to town doesn't seem to be a big deal except for Kane and those eager to make business with him. See how those in church haven't even been informed. And despite agreeing about the news being bad they decide not to do anything about it. As Red Forman--70's Show--put it well it's not a matter of not caring, but of not giving a damn. That's so true of them.Not explained What was Miller's real contribution to the town's economy then? As space is gone, I resume Acting decent to superb. Cinematography. great; moody, evocative; classic shots (railroad tracks, clocks, good period interiors); superb close ups, specially of those big Jurado eyes. Score Hauntingly beautiful.

Kilmer portrays him to perfection in one of the most immaculate and hypnotic biopics I've ever seen.I will be honest and say that I am pretty much going to enjoy any movie about rock and roll by default. The Commitments, Almost Famous, Pirate Radio, etc. All movies I love. But it doesn't mean that is the only reason I love this film. It is, however, a damn good reason. Stone's rendition of the 60's free love era is as haunting as it is captivating. The concert scenes in this film are astoundingly hypnotic because of the mesmerizing visuals and the dark engulfing Doors music playing so crisp and so beautifully. Kilmer did all of his own singing for this film and as the film progresses you start to wonder whether Morrison himself stepped in to play his own part. Kilmer looks and sounds just like the man. The concert bits of the film are Kilmer's vocals and the soundtrack itself is the original Morrison vocals, yet you could never tell the difference. This may have been the role Kilmer was born to play.At first I was worried I wouldn't like this film by the end because of the character of Jim Morrison. He is this ridiculously self-important, pompous douche that only speaks in poetry, calling himself the Lizard King and practically proclaiming himself as a prophet. But it is these bizarre beginnings that lead to the growth of his character into the self destructive, self loathing maniac we see in the last half of the film. Love him or hate him, he is a fascinating character and watching him grow and witnessing the chaos around him is so engaging and yet so frightening. Morrison, in this film, is the poster child for a man with no limitations. The way he destroys himself through drugs and alcohol is ugly, yet you cannot take your eyes off of it. Morrison's fascination with death and how it drives him to the brink of insanity, almost longing for death because it is the ultimate high, is such an asphyxiated tragedy. As much as we tell ourselves we don't, we long to see the levels this man will stoop to and just how far his psychotic nature will take him. The Doors is a film that satisfies our asphyxiation with tragedy and the unfortunate, while telling the story through such a hypnotic and overwhelming method.I've seen a lot of Oliver Stone films and they are all fantastic, but this one has to be my favorite, thus far. Jim Morrison is just such a deranged yet fascinating man whose story is so engaging and yet so bleak and misguided. There were so many things wrong with this man and this film exemplifies them all and develops the story through such a psychedelic medium.

Jim Morrison is just such a deranged yet fascinating man whose story is so engaging and yet so bleak and misguided. There were so many things wrong with this man and this film exemplifies them all and develops the story through such a psychedelic medium. I consider this film a masterful work of art and one of the best biopics I've ever seen. At two hours and twenty minutes, not a second of this film is wasted and I never wanted it to end.

Then he was better known as a TV star following his role as the Bondesque Simon Templar in the Saint, and the follow up as Lord Sinclair in the less successful The Persuaders.When the film starts, Bond's briefing is not in the familiar office of his boss M, but in his apartment where he had just finished cavorting with a delectable Italian agent.M gives Bond the unfortunate news that three British agents have been murdered presumably by one Mr. Kananga, the dictator of a Caribbean country called San Monique. Bond is then ordered to investigate the deaths.Bond's assignment takes him to New York where he meets the beautiful and mysterious Solitaire, a tarot card reader with seemingly possible powers to predict the future. Solitaire played by Jane Seymour (her first acting role) was a virgin who will lose her power if she loses her virginity.He also encounters Tee Hee, the henchman with a hook instead of a hand. (In the Bond novels, Bond's friend Felix Leither had the hook); the seductively menacing Baron Samedi, supposedly The Man Who Can Never Die, and finally the big bad guy himself, Mr. Kananga played charmingly by Yaphet Kotto. Both Julius Harris and Geoffrey Holder who played Tee Hee and Samedi respectively were sadly underused but still their performances as the grotesque bad guys were arresting.Sadly, Desmond Llewlyn did not make an appearance but his character, Q, was still referred to in a comic altercation between Bond and M.Kotto has the distinction of being the first and only black villain in the James Bond franchise. And it was a role he played with equal measures of charm and menace. Kotto always has a magnetic screen presence and it show in this movie, almost matching that of Roger Moore himself, despite his lesser screen time. It was obvious that the Bond film makers were cashing in on the successful blaxploitation movies of the 70s, (although in a reverse order since the black guys are the villains). The racist theme was prevalent in the movie and which begs the question- were they black because they were villains or where they villains who just happened to be black? Roger Moore's interpretation of Bond was radically different from Connery's. He eschews Connery's sardonic wit and roughness to assume a more affable finesse and comedic persona. That charm is what made Roger Moore a more likable Bond in Nigeria (not in my opinion though).He smokes cigars, struts through the street of Harlem dressed like The Prince of Wales, speaks in refined English (his one liners where excellent like when his quip sheer magnetism, darling as he pulls down a zipper with a magnetic watch), shows no anxiety in being in the midst of violent black drug runners (when he is being taken away to his execution, he calmly advises Solitaire not to leave as he shan't be long) and tells a massive henchman called Whisper to keep the change when the henchman serves him with drinks and takes his gun in exchange.LALD is a fast paced movie which unusually for the superficial Bond movies skirts the supernatural world of voodooism, occultism and human sacrifices. The drug theme is also explored via Kananga who wants to monopolize the drug world in US by an operation that does not really make sense.As Kananaga puts it I sell to anyone&#x85;black, white-I don't discriminate Like most Bond films, LALD has its plot holes. It is never explained why the British Secret Service was interested in Kananga in the first place that led to the murder of their three agents, or even why their agents were murdered. Fantastically, one was murdered right in the General Assembly meeting of the United Nations! Or why Kananaga's dummy killers would kill one of their own agents on the verge of revealing information to Bond when they could have nipped the whole problem in the bud by just easily killing Bond. Wrong strategy, bad guys.Despite these plot holes, it is still an arresting movie with such highlights as the climatic boat chase, Bond's nifty watch that could emit a magnetic field, his nerve wracking entanglement with the alligators and a brilliant disco cum spooky song theme song from Paul Marcartney.It is better that its predecessor, the silly Diamonds Are Forever; not the best of the Bond movies but still a lot of fun to watch.

And Revenge of the Nerds is no exception. Characterisation is scant, jokes obvious, dialogue clichéd, and performances running the gamut from bad to worse. Yet it is the heart to this film that made me keep watching, long after I normally would have switched off.At times it is nasty natured, that I give you (I'm fairly sure the protagonists voyeuristic acts in the girls dorm is illegal), and it doesn't exactly paint the youth of any generation in a good light (this was 1984; things have only gotten worse), but the main thing that kept drawing me in was the romance between Anthony Edwards and Michelle Meyrink as Gilbert and Judy. They have chemistry, they're cute, they work together. They're kind of at the centre of this film, and it's a good centre to have.The plot doesn't really matter, because it's just an excuse for some set pieces and punchlines, but at times it seems like the writers have looked at certain scenarios, and stuck the same punchline on each of them (David Carradines nasal, annoying, yet amusing laugh).I did find it a little hard to believe that David Carradine would pull with campus hotty Betty Childs, played by Julia Montgomery in a performance that doesn't really require any acting skill other than the ability to deliver lines saucily, and to not be embarrassed when she gets her breasts out (she does both of these). However I did find it a little hard to believe that she would be won over by Carradine because he is good at sex, and when he said that all nerds think about is sex, which is why he was so good at it, this provided a contradiction with earlier dialogue from him, as well as a complete non-truth.This, and the fact that a character such as Ogre (Donald Gibb) would be in a university at all, are the only real bum notes the film pulls. I did also have a problem with some of the nudity, as it felt out of place, and gave this film an 'R' rating when it probably would have grossed a lot more with a PG-13. As I have mentioned, a lot of the acts in this film are illegal.Pluses include the wonderfully rebellious 'Booger', played to perfection by Curtis Armstrong, the final speech, delivered to Queen's 'We Are The Champions', and a party that begins as an awkward affair, and descends into a drug-fuelled orgy (remember kids, drugs are bad!).At times it is a little hard to know who the audience for this film is, because it is an incredibly sweet movie, with a message that is good for kids, yet it has, as I have mentioned, scenes of nudity, drug taking, and a bestiality joke that made me feel a little uncomfortable.Yet there is a nice message here, and the ensemble pulls it off nicely (if you can forgive the horrendous gay stereotyping).

Seeing McCarthy and Silverman portray the characters they started was another amusing thing. Not to mention some great music to tie the film together. But ultimately, this film needs a reality check, a humor check, and a reason check. It doesn't satisfy enough to meet comedy minimums.Starring Andrew McCarthy, Johnathan Silverman, and Terry Kiser.

So, in the end, children not only have to carry the burden of their own emotionally chaotic and ever-changing inner world, but they need to shoulder the brunt of their parents' failings as well; perhaps this was best exemplified when Antoine's parents demand that he take the garbage out, they need to remind him that in the final analysis he is responsible for dealing with everybody's waste.

Its star John Wayne gave his most winning performance and it is reputed to have been his favourite movie even to the extent of his naming his last born son Ethan after the character he played. Ford's beloved Monument Valley in Arizona never looked more spectacular in Vista Vision and colour and over the years the picture has gained cult status. An integral part of the combined elements that makes THE SEARCHERS great is Max Steiner's outstanding score. It is the picture's driving force - its backbone. Steiner's music propels the film forward, unifies the narrative and gives greater density to its key scenes. In fact without his music much of the picture's impact would be considerably diminished. Yet I am consistently amazed and at a total loss to see here on these pages - where the best part of 400 reviews appear - that Steiner's music is hardly referred to at all by any of the writers. Not only that but even on the extras of the last DVD release three well established film directors, Martin Scorsese, John Milius and Peter Bogdanovitch each speak glowingly of Ford's masterpiece but fail to mention Steiner's exceptional contribution. Bogdanovitch, at one stage, briefly mentions the music and how good it is but never puts a name on its composer. I find this not only doctrinaire but quite bizarre that these three men, who you would imagine should know better, would have such a detached attitude concerning one of the most perfectly conceived scores for a motion picture. Therefore I will attempt here to amend this anomaly and the afore mentioned omissions and give some deserving credence to Max Steiner's exceptional music for THE SEARCHERS which has well earned its place in the history of cinema.A veritable orchestral explosion opens the picture in the form of a fanfare over the Warner Bros. logo. As the credits roll we hear the haunting Stan Jones ballad Song Of The Searchers wonderfully rendered by Ford favourites The Sons Of the Pioneers. The composer later interpolates this song into his score as the theme for the racist protagonist Ethan Edwards (Wayne). Then a lovely version - scored for guitar, solo trumpet and strings - of the traditional ballad Lorena plays under Ford's evocative 'frame within a frame' opening scene as the door of a remote homestead opens to reveal an approaching rider. It then skillfully segues into Bonnie Blue Flag to point up the rider's confederate allegiance. The Lorena ballad later becomes the family theme and is especially effective on solo violin for the scene where Ethan gives the young Debbie his wartime medal as her gold locket (Oh, let her have it - it doesn't amount to much declares Ethan somberly). And later it is arrestingly heard on spinet as Ethan bids farewell to the family and rides out with the posse to begin what effectively will be his great search. But where the score really shines is in the powerful music for the Indian sequences. Here there is a palpable authenticity in the scoring. Aided by the clever orchestrations of Murrey Cutter and some virtuoso playing by the Warner Bros. orchestra (particularly in the percussion section) Steiner fires on all cylinders adding realism, pathos and a sense of foreboding. There are echoes of the composer's King Kong (1933) in the cue for the scene where the Indians surround the posse and the music becomes rhythmically savage for the charge at the river and for the attack on the Indian camp near the finale. The composer's celebrated Indian Idyll (which he originally wrote five years earlier for the Burt Lancaster picture Jim Thorpe-All American) comes into play and can be heard to splendid effect in the Indian camp sequences and as the motif for Look, Martin's (Jeffrey Hunter) new Indian wife. Hearing these cues one can't help but wonder how remarkable it is that this most romantic of film composers - steeped in the musical tradition of late 19th century Vienna - his birthplace - should be so ethnically proficient at musically depicting the native American. More akin to what we have come to expect from this composer are lovely cues such as the sprightly theme for Martin and the lush and sweeping music for Martin and Laurie (Vere Miles). The score - and the movie - ends just like it began with The Song Of The Searchers playing as Ethan and Martin finally bring Debbie home and conclusively the door of a homestead closes on Ethan where a brief fortissimo quotation from that explosive fanfare closes the picture.Alongside the great film music works of Miklos Rozsa, Alfred Newman, Dimitri Tiomkin and others Max Steiner's music for THE SEARCHERS stands head high as one the finest scores ever written for one the finest films ever made and as such should, and must, be alluded to in any dissertation or essay on the film.

Ford's beloved Monument Valley in Arizona never looked more spectacular in Vista Vision and colour and over the years the picture has gained cult status. An integral part of the combined elements that makes THE SEARCHERS great is Max Steiner's outstanding score. It is the picture's driving force - its backbone. Steiner's music propels the film forward, unifies the narrative and gives greater density to its key scenes. In fact without his music much of the picture's impact would be considerably diminished. Yet I am consistently amazed and at a total loss to see here on these pages - where the best part of 400 reviews appear - that Steiner's music is hardly referred to at all by any of the writers. Not only that but even on the extras of the last DVD release three well established film directors, Martin Scorsese, John Milius and Peter Bogdanovitch each speak glowingly of Ford's masterpiece but fail to mention Steiner's exceptional contribution. Bogdanovitch, at one stage, briefly mentions the music and how good it is but never puts a name on its composer. I find this not only doctrinaire but quite bizarre that these three men, who you would imagine should know better, would have such a detached attitude concerning one of the most perfectly conceived scores for a motion picture. Therefore I will attempt here to amend this anomaly and the afore mentioned omissions and give some deserving credence to Max Steiner's exceptional music for THE SEARCHERS which has well earned its place in the history of cinema.A veritable orchestral explosion opens the picture in the form of a fanfare over the Warner Bros. logo. As the credits roll we hear the haunting Stan Jones ballad Song Of The Searchers wonderfully rendered by Ford favourites The Sons Of the Pioneers. The composer later interpolates this song into his score as the theme for the racist protagonist Ethan Edwards (Wayne). Then a lovely version - scored for guitar, solo trumpet and strings - of the traditional ballad Lorena plays under Ford's evocative 'frame within a frame' opening scene as the door of a remote homestead opens to reveal an approaching rider. It then skillfully segues into Bonnie Blue Flag to point up the rider's confederate allegiance. The Lorena ballad later becomes the family theme and is especially effective on solo violin for the scene where Ethan gives the young Debbie his wartime medal as her gold locket (Oh, let her have it - it doesn't amount to much declares Ethan somberly). And later it is arrestingly heard on spinet as Ethan bids farewell to the family and rides out with the posse to begin what effectively will be his great search. But where the score really shines is in the powerful music for the Indian sequences. Here there is a palpable authenticity in the scoring. Aided by the clever orchestrations of Murrey Cutter and some virtuoso playing by the Warner Bros. orchestra (particularly in the percussion section) Steiner fires on all cylinders adding realism, pathos and a sense of foreboding. There are echoes of the composer's King Kong (1933) in the cue for the scene where the Indians surround the posse and the music becomes rhythmically savage for the charge at the river and for the attack on the Indian camp near the finale. The composer's celebrated Indian Idyll (which he originally wrote five years earlier for the Burt Lancaster picture Jim Thorpe-All American) comes into play and can be heard to splendid effect in the Indian camp sequences and as the motif for Look, Martin's (Jeffrey Hunter) new Indian wife. Hearing these cues one can't help but wonder how remarkable it is that this most romantic of film composers - steeped in the musical tradition of late 19th century Vienna - his birthplace - should be so ethnically proficient at musically depicting the native American. More akin to what we have come to expect from this composer are lovely cues such as the sprightly theme for Martin and the lush and sweeping music for Martin and Laurie (Vere Miles). The score - and the movie - ends just like it began with The Song Of The Searchers playing as Ethan and Martin finally bring Debbie home and conclusively the door of a homestead closes on Ethan where a brief fortissimo quotation from that explosive fanfare closes the picture.Alongside the great film music works of Miklos Rozsa, Alfred Newman, Dimitri Tiomkin and others Max Steiner's music for THE SEARCHERS stands head high as one the finest scores ever written for one the finest films ever made and as such should, and must, be alluded to in any dissertation or essay on the film.

The fourth installment in the long-running series of spy thrillers, THUNDERBALL is the one with the jet pack, the eyepatch-wearing Number Two, the mechanized massage rack, the lookalike, the Mardi Gras parade, the dancefloor casualty, the yacht, the orange wetsuit, and the scuba battle.Sean Connery returns as 007 in a plot that involves global terrorist organization SPECTRE hijacking two nuclear bombs and holding the world for ransom. Most of the action takes place in beautiful tropical island locations, with much of the film set underwater. Whether it's scuba diving in the reef, unloading bombs from a submerged plane, fighting in a pool full of sharks, or grappling with enemy combatants in the deep, something's always going on underwater.The James Bond films always sought to bring audiences larger-than-life adventure that they wouldn't see anywhere else. The aquatic theme of THUNDERBALL puts a new twist on the spy action. The climactic battle between military forces and the villain's henchmen is unforgettable, because it takes place entirely under the sea. Orange scuba suits vs. black scuba suits, armed only with harpoons and knives.Besides the frogmen, the movie also offers viewers a brief glimpse of a real, fully operational jet pack (designed for short-range military use) and a look at an exciting Skyhook rescue.Adolfo Celi plays Emilio Largo, SPECTRE's Number Two. He wears an eyepatch (the inspiration for a similar character in Austin Powers movies) and is the main villain. He owns a swanky seaside estate (complete with shark pool) and a deluxe yacht, the Disco Volante.The Bond girls in THUNDERBALL are some of the best, led by Claudine Auger as the lovely Domino (Largo's niece) and Luciana Paluzzi as a redheaded femme fatale. The black-hearted Paluzzi leaves quite an impression. Martine Beswick plays Paula, James Bond's unfortunate female accomplice, and Molly Peters plays a masseuse.When I first made my way through the James Bond films, THUNDERBALL stuck out for me. I enjoyed it a lot then and I enjoy it now. It may not have some of the more iconic Bond moments or villains, but it's about as fun and exciting as they come. The under-the-sea theme gives the movie a unique personality. The series' signature wit and charm are evident. James Bond lives the life we wish we could live. The early Sean Connery Bonds were truly the Golden Age Bonds, and they are all top-notch. THUNDERBALL is one of my personal faves.
