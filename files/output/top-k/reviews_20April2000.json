With big comedy stars like Ben Stiller and Jenna Elfman, one would expect this film to be explosively funny. Instead we get a movie that is plot-heavy and tries for narrative conflict rather than just being light-hearted. \tThe Plot Struggling Rabbi Jacob Schram (Ben Stiller) is in love with a pretty workaholic named Anna Reilly (Jenna Elfman). Father Brian Finn (Edward Norton) is also in love with Anna, but his faith does not allow him to engage in relationships. The three characters were once childhood friends. Jake and Brian have not seen Anna in more than twenty years, however. Conflicts arise when the two men discover each other's passion towards the same woman. \tDevelopment of the setup consists mostly of voice over narration by a drunken Brain explaining his troubles to a bartender. Supporting the opening scenes are actions and development, acquiring believable and likable characters. These characters are a lot of fun to watch. They are also nicely cast and portrayed through lightly inspired performances and some witty dialogue. The story also features a bartender, overbearing parents, an exercise fanatic, demanding schedules, a TV news reporter, religious teaching techniques, and a collision of faiths.  \tIn the movie's first forty-five minutes, ample amounts of physical humor and slapstick gags are supplied-perhaps more parody than you might expect. Some of the material is funny, like Jake's dating life, and others, like flashbacks of Brian's childhood, are not. Specific incidences of religious humor appear to be take from funnier Sister Act series.There is  too little romantic or dramatic tension involved with the story due to the lack of amiable conflict. There are two separate points of view here, involving Jake and Brian. Both revolve around catalytic Anna. Anna is too passive and reactive, however, acting as a median between Brian and Jake. She is such a loosely based and reactive character there is no tension in her character. This leads to the audience's lack of involvement.\tEdward Norton, experienced actor but novice director, does not focus well in Keeping the Faith. There are distracting subplots about sex, music, dating, controlling parents, siblings, and working too much. The occupations of Jake and Brian, the main gimmicks of the film, are mostly unexamined. The filmmakers use each religious concept to pursue conflicts in relations, but are never really explored.  \tEdward Norton is pretty good in one of his first comic roles. He performs light-heatedly and contains the right amount of parody to make his character effective. Ben Stiller is also right on the money here, with his usual sarcastic humor. Jenna Elfman is wildly full of energy and likable charisma. It is unfortunate she could not do more with her character. Just a few weeks ago I saw the romantic comedy Return To Me, full of lovable characters brusting with believable romantic chemistry. Unlike Return To Me, Keeping the Faith concentrates more on situation than on overall appeal. I felt the characters in Return to Me were actually in love.

It's very enjoyable, though the pace is rather slow, it's satire and the characters are intriguing.I have to disagree with those who say the characters are one-dimensional, it's a lie. It's just that we are rather supposed to have fun with them than to examine their wounded souls until we can't sit straight because of the pain, if you know what I mean. (I guess I tend to express myself a little melodramatically, I'm sorry for that)To start off with Lester Burnham, to all you stupids, he is not a pedophile! What are you thinking? In my world this word describes people who are very very much more disgusting in what they think and do, believe me. I don't think I have to go in further detail. Angela is almost adult, and she really asks for it... men lusting after her. She even says it herself that she likes it, and especially IF that's only the lie of an insecure little girl, the bitch shouldn't talk so big. Lusty Lester is what she gets in return for her behavior.Much more than this bad word with a p some hysterical individuals apparently like to employ, Lester is a hero! Not because what he does is right or great, but because he tells all the jerks to p**s off and let him enjoy himself in his little ruts. He doesn't bother anyone so no one should bother him. He wakes up from his suburban zombie existence and finds something like inner peace. Two factors triggered this journey of Lester his crazy infatuation with Angela, and even before that the absolutely unsupportable behavior of his wife, Carolyn, who is really such a jerk and such a phony.Great performances by Kevin Spacey and Chris Cooper, and also the rest of the cast does very fine jobs. (It's good that Thora Birch is back!)For what I wanted to express with my summary line it's an all-American, all-Hollywood movie, but there's nothing of that typical Hollywood kitsch. Absolutely nothing! The emotions are rather restricted and true, and the dialogue is fantastic. Not those annoying There is that guy and what does the guy do? He sees that door where you could ring the bell... monologues that seem to be supposed to be cool. Only the things that have to be said, plus jokes that hit.The amount of violence is okay, and for those who rant about the sexuality, vulgar language, teens smoking etc. (I've read some of the reviews from Christian web sites you can get linked to from here)... come on people, open your eyes! That's reality! Who of you thinks the 17-year-old kids in your neighborhood read the bible every evening before they go to bed at 930 and pray to the Lord above that they can keep their virginity until they marry?Fine, the movie messes with the morals. But that's the fun about it. If not everyone would behave like such a jerk, no one would get hurt, believe me... maybe that's the tragedy about it. Well, I guess if all of us were like Lester it would all collapse. But on the other hand, if we all were like Carolyn we should all shoot ourselves. I hate her character, but I also feel sorry for her.To draw a conclusion it would be a nice change if things would have worked out for Lester. But why not dream. The tragedy of life is that there is so much beauty, but it's all bound to get so damn messed up. That's what the movie conveys in a very light and funny way and with very much irony of situation. It's hilarious, but don't look at it as intellectual or art. Just let Lester *rule* once in a lifetime.

The tragedy of life is that there is so much beauty, but it's all bound to get so damn messed up. That's what the movie conveys in a very light and funny way and with very much irony of situation. It's hilarious, but don't look at it as intellectual or art. Just let Lester *rule* once in a lifetime.

More specifically, it leads us to ask ourselves if our lives and our careers are interchangeable terms.  The film has three well-drawn characters Father Brian Finn (Edward Norton, who also directed), Rabbi Jacob Schram (Ben Stiller), and Anna Reilly (Jenna Elfman) who all have to answer this question in very different ways. When you're man of God, as Brian and Jake are, you can't leave your work at work. You live your job more than any other profession because you're in constant communication with the Boss even after regular office hours. Anna's office is also wherever she is at any given time, thanks to the almighty cellular phone. When these three are reunited for the first time since Anna moved to California in the eighth grade, they find themselves re-evaluating their stations in life.The minute Anna gets off the plane from Los Angeles, we know these two guys are in trouble. Brian falls for her, an obvious problem. Jake's problem is that the mother of every single woman in the church expects Jake to date her daughter. His own mother is seemingly dead set against Jake marrying a gentile-she already ruined his older brother's inter-faith marriage. Jake is worried about people finding out he's in love with a non-Jew and yet, never questions the fact that he, a rabbi(!), is sharing a bed with a woman he's not married to. This would have been a compelling subject to deal with, but the film's creators chicken out (unless the rules have changed and no one told me). This is a rare exception in a film that is not afraid of its subject matter. Faith takes on two big subjects-Love and Faith-and gives both their due. Its creators aren't afraid to do a little preaching on either subject and it all works really well together. The film is a sign of the times, the way it blurs the lines that separate the religions and also the long-standing traditions within those religions. In the world of this story, having one half of the Good Book in common is enough for the Jews and Catholics to get together. Too bad reality is a lot different. This might be the most secular kind of movie there is, one that portrays religions casting aside their customs in favor of something simpler, something easier to understand and live by-Love. Brian and Jake's friendship is the reference point for all of it and it is touching to watch.I hope people will take a chance on this film (yes, go to the theater, don't wait for the video).

I tried not to let it get to me, and many parts of the movie were still funny, but not enough to keep the movie afloat. The only silly scenes in the style of Grail were the alien scene, which seemed more pointless than funny, and the singing crucifixion victims.

Not a bunch of people sitting around and discussing some issues about a trade federation. Although there is a few action-sequences in it, they don't really impress me that much. The last scenes with Darth Maul and the two Jedis is in my opinion the highlight of the movie.Secondly, the characters are a bit thin. You don't really get to know them that well because the movie switches scenes every two seconds. And that's a petty.

What I remember thinking the first time I saw this film, back in the 80s, is that it was boring. Well, that was a little unfair, but I was just thirteen or something like that and sitting through a movie like this wasn't exactly what I enjoyed. I enjoy Alien more now, but even though I don't find it boring anymore, I can't help but feel that it is nothing compared to James Cameron's Aliens. For instance, Alien is not nearly as suspenseful as Cameron's film, the action sequences are lamer (can't blame Scott for that, though, since his film is seven years older than Cameron's), and generally much more happens in the sequel. I also feel that the chemistry between the actors in Aliens are better than in this film. Naturally, though, Alien is much better than David Fincher's third instalment in the series (and he went on to make Fight Club, wow!) and also way better than the fourth instalment. In short it is a good film, but as far as the series go, this is definitely one of those rare cases where the sequel is actually better than the first film!

It has everything a psychotronic film fan could want go-go dancing, priceless dialogue, buxom women, hot rod racing, a constant aura of sex, and villains you can root for!I first became acquainted with Tura Satana through Astro Zombies (right now, my IMDB review for that film is the only one!). I knew she had acting potential, but in such a dog of a film, how could she do anything? Here, she's bitchy, sexy, lovable, exotic, and downright perfect! I have spoken to Tura via e-mail and she is a very sweet lady, but you'd never guess it by her karate-chopping, switchblade-throwing performance as Varla! Haji gives a great turn as the Hispanic Rosie, with constant rolling of the letter r, gorgeous makeup and costumes, and a slight presence of lesbianism. Lori Williams is also great as Billie, the blonde good girl who breaks into go-go dancing fits, seduces musclemen, and gets into a wet wrestling bout with Rosie!While plenty of people will not only accuse Russ Meyer of being a pornographer, but as being misogynistic, Faster Pussycat! and plenty of his other films are strongly the opposite. Faster Pussycat! does not expose one breast, instead reverting to constant shots of breasts just about to pop out of shirts, which, in my opinion, is just plain sexier than full-fledged nudity. All of the female characters (save one, the heroine) are strong women who take what they want, have personalities and feelings, and don't need men in their lives. In fact, men are seen as oggling perverts in the beginning sequence and in the character of the Old Farmer.While the rest of the acting isn't too great, the three female leads more than make up for it. Believe it or not, despite the popularity of the film and its title, it is very hard to find! If you do find it to buy, it will be guaranteed expensive. Meyer charges $80 per video and only leases Faster Pussycat! from his personal collection. If you find it to rent, buy it and tape it, it will make a nice addition to your collection! Both Tura Satana and Haji have websites where you can contact them! On a side note before I close, if this film is ever remade, Tura and Haji can take on their original roles, but Heather Graham would probably fare better in the Lori Williams role.

For those not in the know, it's a movie telling of the backstage antics of the performers in the Meet The Feebles variety show For 92 minutes, you watch these characters bed, spit on and in general abuse each other for their own selfish means.

There are several sequences that seem to be added by director John Waters (er...Peter Jackson) just to push the envelope of taste.  For example, did he really have to write into the script a subplot about the misery of a hare dying from the big one (aids) and a reporter fly who seems to gloat in said hare's misfortune?  I think not.Speaking of the script (and the characters) I found myself smiling with grim satisfaction at the end of the movie, when Heidi Hippo (the show's main star) finally becomes unhinged and mows practically the entire cast down with a machine gun.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"20 April 2000","score":"","review":"  Wow, what a movie. The first couple of minutes before they find the bunker, you feel so much tension as if you were really there.It was as if I switched places with the characters and was experiencing the moment myself. Saving Private Ryan perhaps tried too hard to make you feel as if you were there but all it did was make you think, ouch that had to hurt. This movie makes you think more like the soldiers probably felt, like, I hope I don't get hit by a bullet but I won't let anyone know just how scared I am I'll just take my mind off the subject. Then when they see a fellow comrad in danger you want to help them but not forgetting you can still get your butt blown off. And I must say I was impressed with the technology we have during war times, maybe thats why I liked it so much because I love technology and all that James Bond art.

I found the first enjoyable and if it wasn't for the over-acting of Matthew Lillard and the unsatisfactory ending as a whole, I would have even said that the first Scream is a really good horror flick. The opening sequence with Drew Barrymore is one of the scariest scenes I've ever, ever seen. That said, I hated Scream 2. I hated it so much that first I didn't want to see the third part at all. Now to Scream 3 I'll do it without a plot synopsis now, all you need to know is that the script by Krueger (by the way, why is everyone bemoaning the fact that Kevin Williamson was not involved in the making of S3? Williamsons script for the second one was -to put it politely - impoverished; yet I'm somehow curious to see his directional debut Teaching Mrs. Tingle which is still to be released in the UK) includes in fact a lot of plot holes and  inplausibilities, but then also a few surprises. So there should have been more effort put into the story in general, but what actually disappoints me most about Scream 3 is Wes Cravens direction. Even from lazy scripts you can make out an at least enjoyable thrill ride if you do it right and with enthusiasm for the thing. It seemed to me that Craven lost all interest in the trilogy and more engaged in making films with Meryl Streep and entering new territory. But that's just speculation in the end Scream 3 has far less suspense than hoped (well, there were, admittedly, two or three I nearly jumped out of my seat- moments). So do we get at least some decent gore scenes? Er, no.(But then again, a film doesn't really need to be gory in order to be thrilling) I should also mention the very annoying score which ruins every possible development of tension, the only moody piece of music was, as always, Nick Caves Red Right Hand. What can I say in favour of the movie? Neve Campell is ravishing to look at, Parker Poseys obsession with being Gail Weathers (it goes like I'll follow you whereever you go so that I don't get killed) and of course the gorgeous scene with the knife. Is that enough? To me, it wasn't (though it was still slightly better than the totally botched second one). As it often goes with trilogies the sequels never match the achievement of the first part... (4 out of 10)in comparison Scream (7 out of 10); Scream 2 (er, can I also give a 0 out of 10?)
