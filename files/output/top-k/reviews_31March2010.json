The whole question if time can be changed, and if apes Will rule humans (like seen in Planet and Beneath planet of the apes) is raised but never answered. I guess they wanted to have a happy ending, and decided to leave the question unanswered. Undertsndable, since the first two films have a very grim view of the future, but still unanswered sagas can be a little annoying. So for you who simply want to know what happened to Caesare and his planet of the apes you won't be disappointed.

The audience I saw it with actually applauded at the end of the film, which is rare for a movie. I remember coming back to see it five more times that summer. Yes, it was only just a movie, but such an original, clever, imaginative, heartwarming, charming movie. One that is very enjoyable and relate-able to a wide audience. Back to the Future made a big, positive impression on me. I realized I had seen a special, unique film, that might stand the test of time, which it has. I've seen this film many times since 1985 and it has never failed to lift my spirits. It's simply one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen.Back to the Future was the product of the imagination of director Robert Zemeckis and producer Bob Gale. The story idea was in genesis for several years. This was the third film of Zemeckis, after Use Cars, 1982 did poor box office and Romancing the Stone, 1984 became a minor hit.Marty McFly is an average 80's teenager who accidentally gets sent back in time and interferes with the meeting of his mother and father, jeopardizing his very existence. A simple premise, but one really well thought out and done with imagination and heart. It's part comedy, part action-adventure, part science fiction and part drama. All together, a very entertaining and enjoyable film with great appeal.Here's where Zemecicks first showed what would become one of his trademarks using the same characters in the same setting of different times. This playful manner with history that would fully develop in the visual effect techniques of Forrest Gump, 1994.Back to the Future is really not much of a visual effects film. What sets Back to the Future apart is, that it focuses on story, characters and circumstances, in a playful, clever and imaginative manner.For science minded viewers, it's the first a time travel film got most of the physics correct about time travel. It broke the old designs of past time travel movies. Here, energy is used to crack open the space time continuum and the trip through time occurs in a fraction of a second.There's some surprisingly heartwarming and charming moments between the main and supporting characters, such as Marty and Doc saying goodbye and Marty talking to his mother and father at the dance after they've been reunited. All the characters and situations are very relate-able, which is part of the films' appeal.Zemecicks knew he had a small film here, so he requested and received a big, rousing, traditional style film music score from Alan Sylvestri. The climax and epilogue\/twist ending of the film were especially memorable and engaging. Back to the Future was a critical hit and an enormous box office success, that really launched Zemecicks as a prominent director. The film stayed at number one for 11 weeks, which is the third best ever performance for any movie. It received four Academy Award nominations, the most important and nomination being for Best Original Screenplay. I'm happy this film has stood the test of time to be appreciated and enjoyed by a new generation.

The film was directed by director Alan Parker who was nominated for two Oscars in 1978 and 1988. The film is classified as a drama because of the type of events that occur the film. The film has a serious tone throughout the whole thing which is based on the poor living conditions and poverty of Ireland between the 1920's and 1940's. Drama is defined as a situation or succession of events in a real life having the dramatic progression or emotional effect characteristic of a film or play. The story starts off with a young Frank McCourt as played by Joe Breen and his family which consists of a mother, father, and 3 brothers and a newly born baby girl all living in the United States. After a harsh time in the United States and a tragic death in the family during the depression they moved back to their home country, Ireland. In a small catholic town the father, Malachy McCourt played by Robert Carlyle unable to find a job due to being an alcoholic and a protestant. After more deaths in the family Malachy McCourt goes to England to look for a job and plans to send back money to support his family. Back at home in Ireland the McCourt family struggling to get by and the children having to go out and scrounge up food just so that they can live. While the mother, Angela McCourt played by Emily Watson has to beg for food from the people around the town who have leftovers. But what happened to Malachy McCourt who went over to England to earn money? As Frankie slowly gets older he realizes that for his family to be able to survive he has to get a job and successfully got a job pouring coal into holes in the street to supply heating to houses. Later on Frank has to go to the hospital due to a sickness he got from the unclean and dirty town due to the poor sewage from the outside toilets and people dumping their waste into the streets from the middle of the street. Growing up in a rough environment and finally a teenager Frank finds a girlfriend whom he grows very close to but in the end something goes wrong and Frank can't do anything about it. Malachy McCourt was a character that stood out to me during the film, he was played by Robert Carlyle who won the BAFTA film award in 1998 and also nominated for an Emmy in 2006 for the movie Human Trafficking. Malachy McCourt stood out t me because of the way he portrays life he seems like he gives up too easily and whenever something goes wrong or even if something is going good he still goes to the bar and blows all of the money the family has(which is not much) on alcohol. When Malachy finally comes home from the bars he can barely walk and is singing Irish songs that he has picked up from his life. But even though Robert Carlyle played a character that was disappointing he played him very well. Without Malachy in the movie the story line would not have been as interesting as it was and without Malachy the story line would have had to be completely different. Malachy of course was born in Ireland but in the north part so he was a protestant and was disliked by the mother in law because she was catholic and also he is an alcoholic and drinks the families' money away. I didn't like Malachy because of the way he lived his life and wasting it by drinking and not supporting his family.The best scene in the film to me was when little Frank McCourt was in school and got in trouble because another kid made fun of his shoes that had a bicycle tire in the bottom so that he had tread and his feet were not showing through the bottom. Frank went to the principal's office with another kid and they both got their wrists slapped with a ruler for a punishment. This scene was my favorite because of the picture that you see when Frankie has these shoes that have a huge piece of rubber on the bottom so he walks like a duck. The worst scene in the movie to me was when Malachy went to England to find a job and he said he was going to send back the money he earned from the job. But deep down you know he will not send any money and probably spend it all on alcohol.If I was the director I would have changed the ending of the movie because the way it ends know it leaves you hanging to think about what could happen after Frankie makes it to the United States. I would have kept the movie going and had a flash forward to what Frankie could have been doing when he was 30 years old and had him with his wife and kids in front of the house holding a picture of his mother and father, and that would have been the ending to the film if I was the director.

The film has a serious tone throughout the whole thing which is based on the poor living conditions and poverty of Ireland between the 1920's and 1940's. Drama is defined as a situation or succession of events in a real life having the dramatic progression or emotional effect characteristic of a film or play. The story starts off with a young Frank McCourt as played by Joe Breen and his family which consists of a mother, father, and 3 brothers and a newly born baby girl all living in the United States. After a harsh time in the United States and a tragic death in the family during the depression they moved back to their home country, Ireland. In a small catholic town the father, Malachy McCourt played by Robert Carlyle unable to find a job due to being an alcoholic and a protestant. After more deaths in the family Malachy McCourt goes to England to look for a job and plans to send back money to support his family. Back at home in Ireland the McCourt family struggling to get by and the children having to go out and scrounge up food just so that they can live. While the mother, Angela McCourt played by Emily Watson has to beg for food from the people around the town who have leftovers. But what happened to Malachy McCourt who went over to England to earn money? As Frankie slowly gets older he realizes that for his family to be able to survive he has to get a job and successfully got a job pouring coal into holes in the street to supply heating to houses. Later on Frank has to go to the hospital due to a sickness he got from the unclean and dirty town due to the poor sewage from the outside toilets and people dumping their waste into the streets from the middle of the street. Growing up in a rough environment and finally a teenager Frank finds a girlfriend whom he grows very close to but in the end something goes wrong and Frank can't do anything about it. Malachy McCourt was a character that stood out to me during the film, he was played by Robert Carlyle who won the BAFTA film award in 1998 and also nominated for an Emmy in 2006 for the movie Human Trafficking. Malachy McCourt stood out t me because of the way he portrays life he seems like he gives up too easily and whenever something goes wrong or even if something is going good he still goes to the bar and blows all of the money the family has(which is not much) on alcohol. When Malachy finally comes home from the bars he can barely walk and is singing Irish songs that he has picked up from his life. But even though Robert Carlyle played a character that was disappointing he played him very well. Without Malachy in the movie the story line would not have been as interesting as it was and without Malachy the story line would have had to be completely different. Malachy of course was born in Ireland but in the north part so he was a protestant and was disliked by the mother in law because she was catholic and also he is an alcoholic and drinks the families' money away. I didn't like Malachy because of the way he lived his life and wasting it by drinking and not supporting his family.The best scene in the film to me was when little Frank McCourt was in school and got in trouble because another kid made fun of his shoes that had a bicycle tire in the bottom so that he had tread and his feet were not showing through the bottom. Frank went to the principal's office with another kid and they both got their wrists slapped with a ruler for a punishment. This scene was my favorite because of the picture that you see when Frankie has these shoes that have a huge piece of rubber on the bottom so he walks like a duck. The worst scene in the movie to me was when Malachy went to England to find a job and he said he was going to send back the money he earned from the job. But deep down you know he will not send any money and probably spend it all on alcohol.If I was the director I would have changed the ending of the movie because the way it ends know it leaves you hanging to think about what could happen after Frankie makes it to the United States. I would have kept the movie going and had a flash forward to what Frankie could have been doing when he was 30 years old and had him with his wife and kids in front of the house holding a picture of his mother and father, and that would have been the ending to the film if I was the director.

Throw in any number of truly staggering movies in the stretch--Citizen Kane for starters--and we have to almost expect Alfred Hitchcock to fit right in. With Rebecca he does. It's another perfect movie.Daphne Du Maurier's book of the same title is a great read, something short of a literary classic but something better than a mere best-seller. I read it recently, and was completely transported into a land of subtle drama. That sounds like an oxymoron, but when you see this movie you'll notice how people act with restraint, with glances, with quiet actions, and yet achieve a grandiose, dramatic effect that tears your heart out. It's an archetypal story about a girl who seems to have a dream come true marrying a charming and very wealthy man.But of course, there are skeletons in this man's closet, and Lawrence Olivier plays the inner struggle of Maxim close to the chest. More openly troubled by events, and so sympathetic your heart jumps out of your chest, is the girl, his wife, played by Joan Fontaine. Now here is a performance that is just incredible. She even changes her presence as her innocence slowly bleeds away from start to finish. If the two of them never quite have sparks fly, they're not supposed to. But Hitchcock has done more than chosen a great, cinematic novel and two amazing actors (as well as a flawless supporting cast). With the most romantic, lush sets, delirious lights, and rich, layered photography, all fluidly combined to create scenes so beautiful you can almost taste it, the director has shown, again, that he understands the intuitive power of the cinema. It isn't the outward brilliance of any one scene or shot, or any one conversation that the camera follows invisibly, or any flinging of the curtains to reveal only more fog or sheer obscurity. It's the pacing and sequence of these moments that sucks you into the world and won't let you go.Well, it's no surprise, maybe, that Rebecca won best picture and best cinematography at the Oscars.

After that Roger felt that a wall was built between he and the public, and that incident became the concept of Pink Floyd's future album The Wall, released in 1979. The album was a huge hit, and some of their great classics songs were present in that album such as Another Brick in the Wall, Run Like Hell, Comfortably Numb and many others. But the story doesn't end here. In 1982, Roger wrote an screenplay based on the album's songs and once again the concept was the wall dividing the artist and the crowd. Finally Alan Parker was brought to direct Pink Floyd The Wall in what later he would call as the most expensive student film ever made. To explain the story of the movie is to reduce its greatness, its magical moments, the metaphorical aspects of such a masterpiece yet to be understood. With almost no kind of dialogs and filled with Pink Floyd's songs, the movie tells the story of Pink, a depressed rock star (played by The Boomtown Rats lead singer Bob Geldof), cloistered in a hotel room, or as he thinks, a wall that kept him safe of everything and everyone. The movie then flashes back to Pink's childhood during the war years when his father died, his repressed school days (the Another Brick in the Wall moment), and then move forward to his marriage with an groupie, his rock n'roll days, and his Neo-Nazi hallucinations when Pink thinks he's a leader of a Nazi group (their symbol is a hammer) that eliminates ethnic minorities. In short, it is the rise and fall of Pink's metaphorical wall and the way he deals with it. When I watched it five years ago I wasn't a Pink Floyd fan and I only watched because it was an Alan Parker film and people said that this was an acclaimed film. I watched it, enjoyed most of it, really liked it but I didn't understood almost anything of what this movie was about. Then I watched again and I really felt that this is really a very good film, very enjoyable, one of those movies that it only gets better the more you watch over and over again. It's a work that leaves the audience takes their own conclusions about the story through images, animations, and of course, the great poetry present in the musics. It's an experience like everything involving Pink Floyd but it's also a cinematic experience for anyone who enjoys movies. Some people may leave it after a few minutes because it's not an conventional movie with a developed storyline, it has many flashbacks, it is more like an long video clip but with a story. Those who doesn't like metaphors, ideological concepts stay out and go watch Scary Movie. But if you're an Pink Floyd fan watch it, and even better buy it if you can. To see the songs along with the incredible music of David Gilmour, Richard Wright, Nick Mason and Roger Waters is an very pleasant experience. You're definitely going to sing along with the movie. The best scenes in the movie are the animated sequence when it's played Goodbye Blue Sky (remind me of Todd McFarland's work); Pink being rescued by medics and his manager (Bob Hoskins), the song played is Comfortably Numb; Run Like Hell played in the Nazi attacks; Pink remembering strange moments with his mother (the song played is Mother)and the most awaited scene, the huge hit Another Brick in the wall, when Pink's at the school being insulted by the teacher because he writes poems (the song Money) during class. This scene is very well-known because later MTV would used as the official video for the song back in 1980's. It may not have any great performances, and it's visual sets will remind you of A Clockwork Orange, but it's a wonderful movie. Highly recommended as one of Alan Parker's masterpieces along with Mississippi Burning and The Commitments. I hope that someday someone transforms Pink Floyd's album The Dark Side of the Moon into a movie. That would be excellent! 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"31 March 2010","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" In 1977, during Pink Floyd's In The Flesh tour Roger Waters replied with anger to an excited group of fans who were making trouble during the concert and as result he spat in one people of the group.

Then I watched again and I really felt that this is really a very good film, very enjoyable, one of those movies that it only gets better the more you watch over and over again. It's a work that leaves the audience takes their own conclusions about the story through images, animations, and of course, the great poetry present in the musics. It's an experience like everything involving Pink Floyd but it's also a cinematic experience for anyone who enjoys movies. Some people may leave it after a few minutes because it's not an conventional movie with a developed storyline, it has many flashbacks, it is more like an long video clip but with a story. Those who doesn't like metaphors, ideological concepts stay out and go watch Scary Movie. But if you're an Pink Floyd fan watch it, and even better buy it if you can. To see the songs along with the incredible music of David Gilmour, Richard Wright, Nick Mason and Roger Waters is an very pleasant experience. You're definitely going to sing along with the movie. The best scenes in the movie are the animated sequence when it's played Goodbye Blue Sky (remind me of Todd McFarland's work); Pink being rescued by medics and his manager (Bob Hoskins), the song played is Comfortably Numb; Run Like Hell played in the Nazi attacks; Pink remembering strange moments with his mother (the song played is Mother)and the most awaited scene, the huge hit Another Brick in the wall, when Pink's at the school being insulted by the teacher because he writes poems (the song Money) during class. This scene is very well-known because later MTV would used as the official video for the song back in 1980's. It may not have any great performances, and it's visual sets will remind you of A Clockwork Orange, but it's a wonderful movie. Highly recommended as one of Alan Parker's masterpieces along with Mississippi Burning and The Commitments. I hope that someday someone transforms Pink Floyd's album The Dark Side of the Moon into a movie. That would be excellent! 10\/10 ","genre":"Animation, Drama, Musical"},{"date":"31 March 2010","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" In 1977, during Pink Floyd's In The Flesh tour Roger Waters replied with anger to an excited group of fans who were making trouble during the concert and as result he spat in one people of the group. After that Roger felt that a wall was built between he and the public, and that incident became the concept of Pink Floyd's future album The Wall, released in 1979. The album was a huge hit, and some of their great classics songs were present in that album such as Another Brick in the Wall, Run Like Hell, Comfortably Numb and many others. But the story doesn't end here. In 1982, Roger wrote an screenplay based on the album's songs and once again the concept was the wall dividing the artist and the crowd. Finally Alan Parker was brought to direct Pink Floyd The Wall in what later he would call as the most expensive student film ever made. To explain the story of the movie is to reduce its greatness, its magical moments, the metaphorical aspects of such a masterpiece yet to be understood. With almost no kind of dialogs and filled with Pink Floyd's songs, the movie tells the story of Pink, a depressed rock star (played by The Boomtown Rats lead singer Bob Geldof), cloistered in a hotel room, or as he thinks, a wall that kept him safe of everything and everyone. The movie then flashes back to Pink's childhood during the war years when his father died, his repressed school days (the Another Brick in the Wall moment), and then move forward to his marriage with an groupie, his rock n'roll days, and his Neo-Nazi hallucinations when Pink thinks he's a leader of a Nazi group (their symbol is a hammer) that eliminates ethnic minorities. In short, it is the rise and fall of Pink's metaphorical wall and the way he deals with it. When I watched it five years ago I wasn't a Pink Floyd fan and I only watched because it was an Alan Parker film and people said that this was an acclaimed film. I watched it, enjoyed most of it, really liked it but I didn't understood almost anything of what this movie was about.

It refers only to a detail of the plot, but the very idea of gaslight conjures up images of the smog and grime of Victorian London, of dimly lit chambers and Gothic atmosphere. And these are the images of which the picture is composed.Yes, Gaslight is all about atmosphere, or at least relies upon atmosphere for its impact. The cinematography plays an inordinately large part here. Although there is a lot of darkness, it is not quite like the stark blacks and crisp whites of what is known as film noir. It is instead a motley mix of deep greys. Much of the screen may be immersed in gloom, but the level of detail is amazing, with every item in each cluttered set clearly defined. Keeping all this detail in view is particularly important in giving the house its oppressive character. Joseph Ruttenberg was Oscar-nominated but did not win for his cinematography, while Cedric Gibbons' team bagged the award for their Art Direction and Interior Decoration. However this was at least in part down to how well Ruttenberg shows it off! That wealth of background detail is also important to director George Cukor. Cukor uses a lot of movement, not always to follow the characters but sometimes just to alter the view behind them, and thus change the tone. Take a fairly simple moment, the introduction of Dame May Witty's character. The scene opens with Bergman framed in close-up against the plainness of the seat &#x96; tranquil in her own thoughts. When the camera is moved to reveal Witty, Cukor doesn't simply pull back or scan across, he has it wheel round in a right-angle, bringing the carriage window into view. The tone of the image has now completely changed, with the blur of scenery matching the intrusive, insensitive Witty character. There are hundreds of other equally fascinating examples you can discover for yourself if such things happen to interest you.Cukor also has the sense to turn off the busy backgrounds at key moments and focus us entirely on the actors. And there is a lot of fine acting to focus on here, most notably that of Ingrid Bergman. For much of the time she does not appear exceptional, merely steady and natural. It is at those moments of incredible strain when she becomes captivating. Her hysterical screaming is so utterly real, so piercing and frantic. This is something that actresses so frequently fail at, and one reason why melodramas tend to fall apart at the most crucial points. Bergman's abilities keep the thing afloat throughout. Charles Boyer's performance is a little simpler, but he nicely portrays the epitomic evil without hamming it up. An honourable mention goes to Tom Stevenson, who plays the copper Williams. For a Californian, he does a passable Cockney accent &#x96; not completely seamless but at least hitting the right tones. Incidentally Stevenson is still alive at the time of writing, having turned 100 a few weeks ago.*But all the atmospherics and nuances of the performances serve as a backdrop to what is, in fact, a not particularly amazing thriller plot. It is not appallingly bad, and there are even some great things about it. It's particularly neat the way although it is not made clear for sometimes whether or not Paula is really going made or being set up, Anton is from the off set up as a rather shifty character. The fact that we feel we cannot trust him makes us keenly sense Paula's frustration and sympathise with her plight, rather than the thing looking like some woman-goes-gaga melodrama. But still, considered alone it's not the most plausible or tightly-constructed affair, and that's why the overwhelming tone of the piece and the sincerity of the acting make it what it is. The phrase style over substance is generally meant in a depreciatory sense, but a picture like Gaslight requires style by the bucketful.*Update November 2010 It appears Mr Stevenson in fact died in 2004, but the information was only just added to IMDb.

Being quickly panned by British critics, and then dissed by their American colleagues, leads me to believe that many critics write negative reviews based on the opinions of others. In recent years, many critics seem especially to have hidden agendas, or have an axe to grind, or are pandering to special interest groups, which render their reviews worthless. Often, these critics appear to have never seen the movie they are condemning, or, worst still, are ignoring the cinematography and entertainment value based on their own petty bias. In High Spirits, some critics complained that the plot is thin, flighty and lacks realism?!?! But this is a comedy (and a very good one at that), not a serious theatrical work like as play by Shakespeare or some other artsy-f**tsy piece for the pseudo-intellectual snobs. While not perfect, it is certainly not the complete waste of time that some of these so-called critics claim it to be.The fact is, folks, this movie is very entertaining, a real joy, from the story, to the acting, to the sets, to the special effects, etc., etc. just a pleasure (albeit a guilty one) of movie entertainment. The entire cast give an exuberant, high spirited performance (pun intended) which is sure to tickle your funny bone. Peter O'Toole is hilarious as the penny-less, hereditary keeper of the castle who is about to lose it all. But Liz Smith is a riot, playing Peter's tipsy, widowed mother who still interacts (read has sexual relations) with her dead husband and communicates with other deceased family members.

Therefore, there's something wrong with me because so many of its purported virtues escape me. Is it that I am actually a terrified anxiety neurotic trapped in this body of a robust, tattooed skinhead? Hmm. Nope. It can't be that, because for that I'd need the body of a robust, tattooed skinhead. Let me think.First, this story strikes me as a kind of Kugel gangster story. Sure, the characters all have Jewish names but beneath that we can easily discern the fun-loving, solidary male society of the Italian cowboys on the plains of Spain.Second, this must be the biggest budget Sergio Leone ever handled, and it must have left him tickled pink. He was already into his 50s and this was his biggest chance. It's like a Roger Corman gangster movie, only with money and ambition.Roger Corman never seems to have thought behind the next scene, whereas the length, multi-generational script, and star power of the cast has enable Leone to give this the gloss of nostalgia. Corman wouldn't have bothered. And to a great extent it works too. There is the score of Ennio Morricone to remind us, lest we forget. Not only do we hear Zamphir or somebody on the Peruvian nose flute or shakuhachi or whatever it is, the score even borrows from the Beatles' Yesterday. So, although it has all the earmarks of Leone -- the first 25 minutes have about a dozen words of dialog and they all come in a rush in the last ten -- I guess it has some virtues after all. I'm a sucker for nostalgia and male bonding. I'm a sucker too for the thirteen-year-old Jennifer Connolly waltzing around to Amapola in a mist of magical dust like something out of a fairy tale, criminal, prompting every man to dream of San Quentin. She's serene. She seems secure in her own Alice-in-Wonderland beauty, as if in the thrall of a belief that it will last.It's a lengthy movie and at times slow. The director uses part of that allotment to give us a couple of grown-up scenes. In one, a doomed man holds a casually ominous conversation with his betrayer standing on the opposite sidewalk. A garbage truck grinds along the street between. When it passes the victim is gone.In another, Robert DeNiro learns that the virginal love of his life is about to leave for a career in Hollywood. He rapes her repeatedly in the back seat of a limousine while she kicks and screams until the chauffeur, whom we've never met, brings the car to a screeching halt in the middle of nowhere and opens the back door. DeNiro stumbles out, arranging his clothes, offers the driver a handful of bills and says, Take her home. Wordlessly, the driver goes back to the car, leaving the money in DeNiro's outstretched hand. The scene undoes a little of the damage done by Tuesday Weld and the array of penises. Yes, thinking it over, I'll forgive the adolescent gag of the masked criminals demanding that the sluttish Tuesday Weld identify her rapist by his penis alone. Weld is the whore to Connolly\/McGovern's Madonna. This movie has two kinds of women -- whores and Madonnas. The latter you take home to Mamma. The first you adopt as a mistress. You see what I mean? It's a little hard to squeeze past these calcified clichés.But, okay. Leone has done one thing he deserves credit for. He tries, for the first time in his career that I'm aware of, to illustrate on the screen a genuine sense of loss, loss of friends and of love, of both men and women, not just through the script but Morricone's elegiac score and the judicious use of New York locations, and he comes close enough to get a pass.

Therefore, there's something wrong with me because so many of its purported virtues escape me. Is it that I am actually a terrified anxiety neurotic trapped in this body of a robust, tattooed skinhead? Hmm. Nope. It can't be that, because for that I'd need the body of a robust, tattooed skinhead. Let me think.First, this story strikes me as a kind of Kugel gangster story. Sure, the characters all have Jewish names but beneath that we can easily discern the fun-loving, solidary male society of the Italian cowboys on the plains of Spain.Second, this must be the biggest budget Sergio Leone ever handled, and it must have left him tickled pink. He was already into his 50s and this was his biggest chance. It's like a Roger Corman gangster movie, only with money and ambition.Roger Corman never seems to have thought behind the next scene, whereas the length, multi-generational script, and star power of the cast has enable Leone to give this the gloss of nostalgia. Corman wouldn't have bothered. And to a great extent it works too. There is the score of Ennio Morricone to remind us, lest we forget. Not only do we hear Zamphir or somebody on the Peruvian nose flute or shakuhachi or whatever it is, the score even borrows from the Beatles' Yesterday. So, although it has all the earmarks of Leone -- the first 25 minutes have about a dozen words of dialog and they all come in a rush in the last ten -- I guess it has some virtues after all. I'm a sucker for nostalgia and male bonding. I'm a sucker too for the thirteen-year-old Jennifer Connolly waltzing around to Amapola in a mist of magical dust like something out of a fairy tale, criminal, prompting every man to dream of San Quentin. She's serene. She seems secure in her own Alice-in-Wonderland beauty, as if in the thrall of a belief that it will last.It's a lengthy movie and at times slow. The director uses part of that allotment to give us a couple of grown-up scenes. In one, a doomed man holds a casually ominous conversation with his betrayer standing on the opposite sidewalk. A garbage truck grinds along the street between. When it passes the victim is gone.In another, Robert DeNiro learns that the virginal love of his life is about to leave for a career in Hollywood. He rapes her repeatedly in the back seat of a limousine while she kicks and screams until the chauffeur, whom we've never met, brings the car to a screeching halt in the middle of nowhere and opens the back door. DeNiro stumbles out, arranging his clothes, offers the driver a handful of bills and says, Take her home. Wordlessly, the driver goes back to the car, leaving the money in DeNiro's outstretched hand.

The first relied heavily on the story, which was a about a unfortunate 90's working girl who is tormented by the son of the devil when a witchhunter chases him through time to the present day. It sounds far fetched, but it is surprisingly well-written. This one is about the return of the Warlock, this time he's trying to collect 7 coveted runestones that, once collected, will spell out the true name of his demon father and ultimately destroy the world (hence the title, The Armageddon). This one is much campier and much, much gorier than the first. I love Anthony Hickox though, I just can't help it. He's like Brian Yuzna, crazy, far-fetched stories, campy dialogue, tongue-in-cheek humor (check out Waxwork 2) and lots of over-the-top (but tasteful enough to usually avoid being unrated) gore. A boy learns that he is a descendant of a long line of druids, a group who has been covertly fighting the evil and superhuman for centuries. Instead of brawn, he must strengthen his mental power in order to face a final showdown of good and evil. Julian Sands once again hams it up and makes you hate him, while unleashing his unholy rage in some of the most creative kill scenes ever. I won't give much away, but he is reborn through a beautiful woman in a very painful manner, and the folks possessing the runestones get put through hell, let me tell you. The deaths are very gory, SFX-filled and creative, just watch what happens to the art collector. He becomes part of his own collection, so to speak.If you liked Children of the Corn 3, Hellraiser 3, the Waxwork series and can take campy dialogue with a grain of tolerant salt, then rent this movie for solid entertainment (for 85 minutes or so.)
