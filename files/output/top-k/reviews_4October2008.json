It is the love story we want to be real. It is the ultimate in magic and adventure. Its the Citizen Kane of Superhero movies.Why? Because the fabric of the whole production can be summed up in one word Belief. It believes itself and we believe it. We believe a man can fly. It evokes every time i watch it a million childhood fantasies, wrapping myself in a towel and believing i could fly. Taking three running steps outstretching my arms and with a swoosh of my mouth i WAS Christopher Reeve in flight ready to save the world from whatever danger lay in store.Like many kids growing up in the UK (and the rest of the world too) in the 1980's Superman The Movie and Superman II were a potent part of our lives and even more spectacularly our Christmases. I cherish those times when sat round the TV as a family to watch these movies and enjoy every minute of them.Alexander and Ilya Salkind captured magic in a bottle. I am eternally grateful for them for giving me my own piece of mythology that i feel empowered and amazed by. Richard Donner is the weaver of our dreams here, and the man did a totally fantastic job with this. Donner is truly under-rated and i think its about time the Academy gave him an honorary Oscar. I believe every frame that Donner filmed and whats more i enjoy it. I enjoy the way he peppered it with humour and spectacle. I love the way Robert Benton and David and Leslie Newman and later Tom Manciewicz added a splash of colour to Mario Puzo's epic script, bringing it to life even more so and making a comic book live. Then there is the stunning production design by John Barry (over looked at the Oscars) and the clarity of Geoffrey Unsworths cinematography (ditto). The special effects i can honestly say are awe inspiring. By todays standards they are under the glare, but they are fun and for the time top deck. And yes i really did believe a man could fly. Its the cast that really set the screen alight. You couldn't have asked for a better Perry White than Jacki Cooper with his clunky, cocky and dry interpretation. Marc McClure as Jimmy Oelson is so key for the younger audience, as a kid i really looked up to Jimmy and thought if he can be supermans friend so can i. Ned Beatty is superb as Ottis, never stepping over the line with the comedy to make the character unbelievable. Glen Ford and Phyllis Lane are heart breaking as Ma and Pa Kent and Margot Kidder is just a heart breaker. As a kid i had an almighty crush on Margot and she is Lois, shes fun, spikey, a true womans libber a great fit for the character. Gene Hackman is amazing as Lex, doing two extremes The hillariously funny and the chillingly evil. One of my favourite scenes comes when Superman asks Lex Is that how you get your kicks by planning the deaths of innocent people to which the up till now jovial joker Lex coolly replies No by causing the deaths of innocent people. Hackman gives the movie a heart beat and makes more of the character with what could have become a classic Bond villain, with Hackman it never does, he looks as though he is having a ball and we do to. And of course there is Marlon Brando who is electrifying as Jor-El. Worth every penny of his $4million salary, Brando adds real class to the movie and gives it weight. It is a real shame that when critics consider Brandos post Godfather career they over look his performance as Jor-El because i think it is a superb piece of acting, and Brando is great and out of his usual mould.But the movie belongs to Christopher Reeve. He is Superman then as now and he always will be. He is Oscar worthy in the role, he has charisma and energy and looks as though he has just stepped out of one of the comic book panels from 1978! He brings the movie to life and adds to the magic. Reeve will be forever dyed into the Superman mythos because HE IS Superman. No actor ever looked more like the character and i doubt ever will. Whether he is holding up a helicopter with one hand or helping frisky the kitten from a tree, or bumbling around as Clark Kent, Reeve makes it work. His Superman is someone we can look up, someone we could idolise and we did, hes someone we trusted and yes someone we loved.

What it needs is Audrey Totter as Rose Loomis instead of Marilyn Monroe and Charles McGraw as George Loomis instead of Joseph Cotton. We'll keep Jean Peters but let's ditch her husband, especially when played by an actor named Casey Adams as an irritating clone of Robert Cummings. Rose Loomis is a tramp, and a dangerous one, but Monroe for my money is just giving us a caricature of a tramp, all self-conscious sex- pottedness with way too much lip action when she sings. Just to recap George Loomis (Cotton) is a loser, without the kind of lusty stamina that could keep happy his younger, lush and scheming wife, Rose (Monroe). They're staying at the Rainbow Cabins, right on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls. Then Polly and Ray Cutler (Peters and Casey) check in for a second honeymoon. It's not long before Polly and we realize Rose has a young, handsome lover. If Rose has her way, George Loomis might not be with us for much longer. And all the while a lot of water keeps crashing over the Falls. We're in for double crosses, murderous twists, desperate escapes and lots of what must be glue-on lipstick for Monroe's kisser. (It's bright red, thick and glossy, and she never gets a speck on her teeth or a smear on her pillow.). Of course, there's a reason the movie was named after Niagara Falls and it just might be that George Loomis has better survival instincts that we were led to believe. There are bits and pieces of interesting scenes, but bits and pieces of old Hitchcock do not a Hitchcock movie make. For me, Monroe has almost always been little more than a collection of curves and breathy sighs, a style-less singer and an extremely limited actress. Her great talent was in having that rare ability to reach an audience through the camera and make us forget there's a camera at all. She was one of Hollywood's great artificial creations, who was blessed mysteriously with genuine star dazzle. In Niagara, however, she's scarcely more than an Eagle Scout's naughty dream. She's not a good enough actress (or even a bad enough one) to be a first-rate femme fatale. It's Jean Peters who lends Niagara what quality and fascination it carries. After the set-up of the scheme, in fact, the less we see of Monroe the better the story becomes. For the last third of the movie, we don't see her at all, and that's when the movie starts developing some real B-movie quality. Niagara was made as a vehicle for Monroe, but, for me, she hasn't the skills to bring it off. The oddness of Monroe dominating her scenes and Peters dominating hers makes for a discombobulating story balance. Let's not forget Denis O'Dea as Inspector Starkey. He was an Irish actor with a fine stage reputation who made a number of British and Hollywood films, usually as smart, reserved police detectives. One of his best roles was in Carol Reed's Odd Man Out. O'Dea played a police inspector who was relentless in his pursuit of the wounded Johnny McQueen (James Mason), but sympathetic toward Kathleen Sullivan (Kathleen Ryan), the woman who loves McQueen and is determined to help him escape. It's a fine movie with one of Mason's great performances. Niagara is sort of fun to watch. The twists of fate, jealousy and retribution are almost always satisfying. Jean Peters gives a smart, sympathetic performance, and there's this strange, artificial creation of breasts, lipstick and sleepy eyelids to look at.

Rose Loomis is a tramp, and a dangerous one, but Monroe for my money is just giving us a caricature of a tramp, all self-conscious sex- pottedness with way too much lip action when she sings. Just to recap George Loomis (Cotton) is a loser, without the kind of lusty stamina that could keep happy his younger, lush and scheming wife, Rose (Monroe). They're staying at the Rainbow Cabins, right on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls. Then Polly and Ray Cutler (Peters and Casey) check in for a second honeymoon. It's not long before Polly and we realize Rose has a young, handsome lover. If Rose has her way, George Loomis might not be with us for much longer. And all the while a lot of water keeps crashing over the Falls. We're in for double crosses, murderous twists, desperate escapes and lots of what must be glue-on lipstick for Monroe's kisser. (It's bright red, thick and glossy, and she never gets a speck on her teeth or a smear on her pillow.). Of course, there's a reason the movie was named after Niagara Falls and it just might be that George Loomis has better survival instincts that we were led to believe. There are bits and pieces of interesting scenes, but bits and pieces of old Hitchcock do not a Hitchcock movie make. For me, Monroe has almost always been little more than a collection of curves and breathy sighs, a style-less singer and an extremely limited actress. Her great talent was in having that rare ability to reach an audience through the camera and make us forget there's a camera at all. She was one of Hollywood's great artificial creations, who was blessed mysteriously with genuine star dazzle. In Niagara, however, she's scarcely more than an Eagle Scout's naughty dream. She's not a good enough actress (or even a bad enough one) to be a first-rate femme fatale. It's Jean Peters who lends Niagara what quality and fascination it carries. After the set-up of the scheme, in fact, the less we see of Monroe the better the story becomes. For the last third of the movie, we don't see her at all, and that's when the movie starts developing some real B-movie quality. Niagara was made as a vehicle for Monroe, but, for me, she hasn't the skills to bring it off. The oddness of Monroe dominating her scenes and Peters dominating hers makes for a discombobulating story balance. Let's not forget Denis O'Dea as Inspector Starkey. He was an Irish actor with a fine stage reputation who made a number of British and Hollywood films, usually as smart, reserved police detectives. One of his best roles was in Carol Reed's Odd Man Out. O'Dea played a police inspector who was relentless in his pursuit of the wounded Johnny McQueen (James Mason), but sympathetic toward Kathleen Sullivan (Kathleen Ryan), the woman who loves McQueen and is determined to help him escape. It's a fine movie with one of Mason's great performances. Niagara is sort of fun to watch. The twists of fate, jealousy and retribution are almost always satisfying. Jean Peters gives a smart, sympathetic performance, and there's this strange, artificial creation of breasts, lipstick and sleepy eyelids to look at.

These many years later and in a world so utterly changed from the mid 70's my take on this movie is going to disappoint many others who have written many pages of glowing reviews here.Some films, like good wines, age very well. I know it is a cliché, but in this case, true. This film would have been viewed in 1975 as spine tingling, sensational and would have given movie goers the sense that the world really is filled with scheming crackpots who do the dirty work for faceless government agencies. I have not read the book that this movie is based on but I'll bet it is quite good. Seen right now towards the end of 2008, this film looks quite laughable to me. Compare if you would the enormous resources to hunt down one man on the loose in Enemy of the State. Now that is how an agency chases a wanted asset. Condor was on a small list of people who were to be eliminated but one gets the impression in the movie that it was farmed out to second rate hacks who were something akin to rent-an-agent-hit-man. I don't know if it was director Pollack's failure to deliver a sense of urgency or it was budget constraints at the time of filming or weakness of script.People comment about the tension in the movie and yes there is tension. It all leads up to a head scratching what???? at the end with almost no probable resolution to go home with. The work of spies and counter\/double spies is the fertile material that the best novelist of the genre entertain us with. One of the most superb examples of this type of theme is in the film The Conversation shot by F.F. Coppola. Consider if you would that that film came out one year earlier than this one. The comparisons are very valid. Coppola's is a small masterpiece with Gene Hackman in one his very best roles. The script, story, acting and editing is mesmerizing. Consider then this film, the Three days of the condor and for me it is running on half as much horsepower. The plot had potential but got lost in confusing twists and turns. You never want to loose the audience in too much complexity because they have to walk away with an idea of a story that goes from point 1 to point 2. Even if the bad guys win or something dire happens at the end, you at least have to have an idea of what happened. Coherence counts because at our primal selves, we are rational beings who enjoy order. Three days of the Condor is too nebulous and does not clarify enough; ambiguity hangs over the resolution like a fog. If this was deliberate I did not enjoy the ride.The actors are all professionals and while not given as much to work with that could provide material to shine with, they all get by. Faye Dunaway was hamstrung by the handling of her character development. As implausible as her relationship is with Condor she succumbs to his story through a sympathy that is only hinted at maybe she's a lonely soul looking for something to hang on to? Her best work was with Chinatown and Network. She is not miscast but seen now is wasted in the role. John Houseman was wasted in his small role but of course was used because he added gravitas. This was a great actor who could read from the phone book and give you chills up your spine.Cliff Robertson looks throughout the whole film like he is wearing a terrible toupee. Maybe I'm wrong and that was just his too long hair but I kept wondering when it would fall off his head. He is a very fine actor but I found his persona too remote and disinterested. I would have better enjoyed someone like Charles Durning, who always delivers power. Robert Redford has had one shadow over his whole acting career his incredible good looks. Unfortunately for him, this film accentuates those good looks and seen from my time, it distracts from a mediocre role. He is a fine actor and a terrific director. His character as Condor has much potential and given to a younger actor today would deliver more edge. Speaking of which, his character remains too confused and immobilized for too long. I can imagine that if Colin Farell or Russell Crowe had this role that they could develop a much more gritty and edgy performance. I agree with some that this is a film that begs to be remade.The music of David Grusin drips of 70's television idiom and really creeped me out. It has not aged well; it is not his fault but that type of music just sounds awful in the present time. Last but not least, I was given quite a jolt several times when I saw something in this film the Twin Towers feature front and center in several shots; I suppose it is something in the New York City skyline that has graced many films. Seen these short years after 9\/11, it still chills.This is not a great film by our standards today and if remade I am sure can go that extra mile.

The act of killing makes him feel intensely alive. What he feels next is not guilt but disappointment. It was not as wonderful as he'd hoped. Maybe next time it will be perfect. --Dr. Helen Hudson speaking on serial killers. Copycat is a first-class psychological serial killer\/diller\/thriller nearly undone by a conventional slasher\/thriller climax. The end works well enough, but once you've seen one jump-out-and-scare-us, spray-in-the-face, last-minute-save cliché you've seen them all. The only difference in the clichés is how close we get to the blade going in, the skull cap blasting off, and the last minute twist being irrelevant to the story. What makes Copycat so superior to the others can be summed up in two names Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter. Weaver plays Helen Hudson, an authority on serial killers, in demand for lectures, consulted by the police, and a smart woman. That all changes when she is attacked by a serial killer and barely survives. The guy winds up in prison for life. Hudson winds up a prisoner, too. Thirteen months later we can see that she's been so traumatized that she has turned her apartment into a fortress. She's too frightened to venture outside. She needs liquor to get through the hours and pills and paper bags to deal with the panic attacks. She trusts few others. She deals with life through her computer. She's still an authority on serial killers, but her life has become a wasteland. (She does have that terrific San Francisco apartment. Then she discovers that there is a new killer at work, one who mimics the style of killing that other serial killers have used. When she tells the police that recent, horrible murders are being committed by one madman, that brings us to Holly Hunter, who plays police inspector M. J. Monahan. Monahan is quick, smart, feisty, small and, yeah, kinda cute. She's also tough enough to make big, male cops nervous. She's friendly, she's liked, she's prickly and no one doubts who's in charge when she's on a case. Dead bodies don't bother her too much. Monahan is a pro. Between Hudson's knowledge of serial killers, as wracked out as she is, and Monahan's gritty persistence, it's not long before we...then Hunt...then Monahan...realize Hunt has become the target for the copycat killer's affections. Now we're in the middle of a stylish, murderous cat-and-mouse game. Monahan, working with the difficult, isolated Hudson, is determined to capture this man. And the serial killer is going to go after Hudson, locked away in her fortress of an apartment. Copycat gives us every old favorite in the book...darkened hallways, closed shower curtains, empty bathrooms, cops tricked off their assignments, ingenious ways to kill...and they still work. In an added twist, the current killer seems somehow to be able to communicate to the man who attacked Hunter and who now is in a secured slammer. The only real drawback, if one doesn't mind too much the standard scares at the end, is the movie's length...more than two hours. If the director had had the energy to lop off 20 minutes the way the serial killer lops off lives, the movie, in my view, would have been even better. Even so, Copycat is a fine, intelligent movie made special by Hunter and Weaver, and with effective performances by Will Patton, Dermot Mulroney and a really unpleasant Harry Connick, Jr. The score is low-key and evocative. There's even a song by Sting and Andy Summers that the killer seems particularly fond of It's murder by numbers, one, two, three \/ It's as easy to learn as your a b c \/ Murder by numbers, one, two, three \/ It's as easy to learn as your a b c Now if you have a taste for this experience \/ And you're flushed with your very first success \/ Then you must try a twosome or a threesome \/ And you'll find your conscience bothers you much less Because it's murder by numbers, one, two, three \/ It's as easy to learn as your a b c.

She's friendly, she's liked, she's prickly and no one doubts who's in charge when she's on a case. Dead bodies don't bother her too much. Monahan is a pro. Between Hudson's knowledge of serial killers, as wracked out as she is, and Monahan's gritty persistence, it's not long before we...then Hunt...then Monahan...realize Hunt has become the target for the copycat killer's affections. Now we're in the middle of a stylish, murderous cat-and-mouse game. Monahan, working with the difficult, isolated Hudson, is determined to capture this man. And the serial killer is going to go after Hudson, locked away in her fortress of an apartment. Copycat gives us every old favorite in the book...darkened hallways, closed shower curtains, empty bathrooms, cops tricked off their assignments, ingenious ways to kill...and they still work. In an added twist, the current killer seems somehow to be able to communicate to the man who attacked Hunter and who now is in a secured slammer. The only real drawback, if one doesn't mind too much the standard scares at the end, is the movie's length...more than two hours. If the director had had the energy to lop off 20 minutes the way the serial killer lops off lives, the movie, in my view, would have been even better.

The act of killing makes him feel intensely alive. What he feels next is not guilt but disappointment. It was not as wonderful as he'd hoped. Maybe next time it will be perfect. --Dr. Helen Hudson speaking on serial killers. Copycat is a first-class psychological serial killer\/diller\/thriller nearly undone by a conventional slasher\/thriller climax. The end works well enough, but once you've seen one jump-out-and-scare-us, spray-in-the-face, last-minute-save cliché you've seen them all. The only difference in the clichés is how close we get to the blade going in, the skull cap blasting off, and the last minute twist being irrelevant to the story. What makes Copycat so superior to the others can be summed up in two names Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter. Weaver plays Helen Hudson, an authority on serial killers, in demand for lectures, consulted by the police, and a smart woman. That all changes when she is attacked by a serial killer and barely survives. The guy winds up in prison for life. Hudson winds up a prisoner, too. Thirteen months later we can see that she's been so traumatized that she has turned her apartment into a fortress. She's too frightened to venture outside. She needs liquor to get through the hours and pills and paper bags to deal with the panic attacks. She trusts few others. She deals with life through her computer. She's still an authority on serial killers, but her life has become a wasteland. (She does have that terrific San Francisco apartment. Then she discovers that there is a new killer at work, one who mimics the style of killing that other serial killers have used. When she tells the police that recent, horrible murders are being committed by one madman, that brings us to Holly Hunter, who plays police inspector M. J. Monahan. Monahan is quick, smart, feisty, small and, yeah, kinda cute. She's also tough enough to make big, male cops nervous. She's friendly, she's liked, she's prickly and no one doubts who's in charge when she's on a case. Dead bodies don't bother her too much. Monahan is a pro.

Now maybe age had something to do with it, but this time I was entranced. Contempt is really about movie making, while simultaneously showing the collapse of a marriage. The plot concerns a writer who brings his wife with him to Cinecitta in Rome to meet with the producer and director of a new version of Homer's The Odyssey to determine how the script should be rewritten. The writer isn't big on the idea of doing a screenplay, fighting with himself that maybe he is selling out. He and his wife end up on the island of Capri with the film crew for the rest of the film. The casting is interesting. The writer is played by Michel Piccoli, his wife by Brigitte Bardot, the producer by Jack Palance and the director by real life director Fritz Lang. This was the last thing Lang ever did that appeared on film, and it was a performance that he should be proud of. The angst he displays in his dealings with tyrannical producer Palance is palpable. Lang, having lived the same experience he portrays here with tyrannical producers in his own career was more than a blueprint for truth in body language and vocal expression. Other members of the cast include Godard himself as an assistant to the director (are we trying to say something here?), and the beautiful Giorgia Moll as assistant to the producer. Moll I was familiar with from one of my childhood favorites, the Steve Reeves 1961 version of Thief of Bagdad (only two years before Contempt). She apparently is still living, but hasn't been on screen since 1985. I haven' seen many Bardot films, but she was exciting in ...And God Created Woman. I also liked her okay in the Louis Malle short, William Wilson, part of the the Edgar Allen Poe compilation Spirits of the Dead. Bardot in Contempt is a different story. She is fiery and fascinating. Piccoli as her husband has the right balance of intellect and vibe of loser. Jack Palance as the producer is about as hateful a character as I've seen him play. Only he could have done it so well. Godard apparently hated dealing with the actual producers of the film, Carlo Ponti and Joseph E. Levine, and combined both elements of their personality as he saw them into the character Palance plays.According to the commentary on the Criterion edition, Ponti and Levine demanded that Godard have major a nude scene with Bardot. The director obliged, but he did so in his own way, sticking it right at the start of the film to get it over with, and lit strangely so the focus is on the color and less on Bardot's behind. He also sucked all the romance out of the scene by having the dialog be read without passion and having it suggest the seeds of a marriage about to fail. The film is moderately paced with many languid camera moves, but it was so stunning to look at and the character interrelationships so compelling that I found myself completely drawn in. This may be Godard's best direction of actors, and it's due in no small part by the effective casting. Piccoli and Bardot work so well together to show the disintegration of their relationship, it was unnerving. The scene in their flat where they walk from room to room as their relationship disintegrates is a stunning piece of acting, and as conceptually brilliant as it gets visually. Bardot's character is also a real mystery. We never really know why she wants to end the marriage, but she wants to with such intense passion, and with little or no explanation to her husband, that it only makes her character all the more compelling. The other star of the film is the amazing isle of Capri, shot under absolutely ideal weather conditions. This is one of the most beautiful films from the 60s. Even the interiors take your breath away. Godard found this rich villa in Capri with a giant window in the living room that looks out onto the aqua blue water and jagged rocks that bite into the sea. What a place to live! The bold color sense really struck me though out. The use of primary colors, primarily red, blue and white (the couches, as an example) add a stark vibrancy. French New Wave cinema eye candy. I know Godard is not a filmmaker for everyone, and I've found some of his films completely worthless (Sympathy for the Devil), but he was always willing to take chances, experimenting in different genres and doing things no one else was even conceiving of. Contempt is a very successful realization of Godard at the peak of his skills.There's a beautiful score by Georges Delerue. Strangely, the Italian release of the film removed Delerue's music and replaced it with a vastly different one by Piero Piccioni, one of my favorite composers, but not someone I would think would be a fit for this. Contempt might be a good Godard film to check out as an introduction to this director. Like Citizen Kane, Vertigo, Children of Paradise, Grand Illusion, Fellini's 8 1\/2 and Ford's The Searchers, Godard's Contempt frequently makes the list of international film critic's Top Ten Films of All Time.

There is something in the deliberate journey of time as Don Corleone entrusts his reins of power that would have made an hour-and-forty-minute-long thriller unbecoming. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you understand merely by the way they exchange looks, or don't, or speak to each other. We are inclined to associate with Don Corleone's family not because we enjoy their gang wars, but because we have been with them from the opening, where they celebrate a wonderful wedding full of old Italian songs, dances and love, and later we watch them await violence while sitting at the kitchen table and eating the pasta cooked by Clemenza.Endowed with Nino Rota's immortal, extraordinary music score, this consummate masterpiece is entitled The Godfather, a title not only relevant because of the wise Don Vito Corleone, who heads his family with unruffled effectiveness, but also to his son Michael, a hesitant college graduate who is in the beginning feeling shame of his criminal background and firm on living the life of an upright citizen. Coppola follows Michael's ascent to power within the family, on top of the concurrent wearing away of his heart.Vito Corleone himself is not even the central character in the drama. He is a relaxed puppeteer. The central character, really, slowly comes to be the youngest, smartest son, Michael, who absorbs the spirit of his father's standing while reworking his outdated customs. The Godfather's function in the family enterprise is illustrated by his name, existing outside the following generation which will continue and, with any luck, point the family into legal endeavors. Marlon Brando, who plays Vito as a perceptive, resilient model family man in his wise latter years, in fact has the character lead whereas Al Pacino, as Michael, is the lead. Unhurried and physically at ease, one knows his reaction would be of great anger if he were to be harassed. In the face of his grooming, which is given the least effort needed for a good, attractive look, there's a look about him as if he's just awakened, and that first groggy morning hour is the time he always seems to be stuck within. His presence is imprinted with a brooding, nonchalant style. Smooth and understated, he musters a searing inner fire that makes his tremendous character arc so impactful and amazing. But Brando's performance, as always, is expertly offhand, and it earned him an Oscar. His voice and physicality consciously lack precision, and the incidental result is of a man so at home with power that he no longer needs to prompt anyone.The remaining actors furnish one case-in-point after another of superb, instinctive casting. Macho and tempestuous James Caan and pragmatic and down-to-earth Robert Duvall, for instance, hardly have to act to embody their roles. While this, the quintessential crime drama, is an extensive, painstakingly thorough film of nearly three hours, there genuinely isn't time to go into the personal history and distinctiveness of such characters as Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the hardened, heavyset family lieutenant, Jack Woltz (John Marley, who was excellent in Faces), the movie baron, Luca Brasi, the faithful contract killer, McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), the corrupt cop, and the rest. Coppola meets this issue head-on with unassuming typecasting. A character who appears in a story long enough to say hello and goodbye, no matter how small, better be real enough that you can assume who he votes for.Really, the opening wedding sequence deeply familiarizes us with the dynamics of the family, an authoritarianism in the guise of Old World ceremony. Coppola asserts a style and a visual guise that is quintessential, through Gordon Willis's reddish-brown tinted, overexposed cinematography, everything period furnishings.Men wearing black suits sitting in dark boardrooms parley the particulars of prostitution and gambling, and fashion an isolated society that issues stability and integrity, that is in terms of their own advantages. Politicians and policemen are merely intimidated or trafficked. Esteem and reliability are the legal tender, and all influence emerges from the Don, who calmly keeps quiet control over his territory.His successor is Santino, the Caan role, always cooking with implicit rage and is incredibly eager to inherit the position. His brothers are Michael and the sniveling pushover Fredo, played by the late John Cazale. The Duvall role is Tom Hagen, the unemotional, factual family lawyer and all-around professional shrewd pragmatist embraced by Vito as a child and brought up as his own. The women are not much more than background scenery. Vito's wife scarcely speaks or even appears. Sonny's wife suffers silently through his shameless infidelity, and the Corleone daughter, Connie, played by Talia Shire, is so often overlooked that her brothers take no notice of her unless she protests about her disgusting husband having beaten her.An assault on Vito's life alters Michael's attitude, and he comes back to help defend his family's wellbeing as Sonny takes rash control, making a mess of the business and laying everyone on the line, while the laid up and incapacitated Vito can do no more than look on. Michael's bona fide defining moment make its mark in one of the film's most unforgettable scenes of ultimate virtuosity.

In the face of his grooming, which is given the least effort needed for a good, attractive look, there's a look about him as if he's just awakened, and that first groggy morning hour is the time he always seems to be stuck within. His presence is imprinted with a brooding, nonchalant style. Smooth and understated, he musters a searing inner fire that makes his tremendous character arc so impactful and amazing. But Brando's performance, as always, is expertly offhand, and it earned him an Oscar. His voice and physicality consciously lack precision, and the incidental result is of a man so at home with power that he no longer needs to prompt anyone.The remaining actors furnish one case-in-point after another of superb, instinctive casting. Macho and tempestuous James Caan and pragmatic and down-to-earth Robert Duvall, for instance, hardly have to act to embody their roles. While this, the quintessential crime drama, is an extensive, painstakingly thorough film of nearly three hours, there genuinely isn't time to go into the personal history and distinctiveness of such characters as Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the hardened, heavyset family lieutenant, Jack Woltz (John Marley, who was excellent in Faces), the movie baron, Luca Brasi, the faithful contract killer, McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), the corrupt cop, and the rest. Coppola meets this issue head-on with unassuming typecasting. A character who appears in a story long enough to say hello and goodbye, no matter how small, better be real enough that you can assume who he votes for.Really, the opening wedding sequence deeply familiarizes us with the dynamics of the family, an authoritarianism in the guise of Old World ceremony. Coppola asserts a style and a visual guise that is quintessential, through Gordon Willis's reddish-brown tinted, overexposed cinematography, everything period furnishings.Men wearing black suits sitting in dark boardrooms parley the particulars of prostitution and gambling, and fashion an isolated society that issues stability and integrity, that is in terms of their own advantages. Politicians and policemen are merely intimidated or trafficked. Esteem and reliability are the legal tender, and all influence emerges from the Don, who calmly keeps quiet control over his territory.His successor is Santino, the Caan role, always cooking with implicit rage and is incredibly eager to inherit the position. His brothers are Michael and the sniveling pushover Fredo, played by the late John Cazale. The Duvall role is Tom Hagen, the unemotional, factual family lawyer and all-around professional shrewd pragmatist embraced by Vito as a child and brought up as his own. The women are not much more than background scenery. Vito's wife scarcely speaks or even appears. Sonny's wife suffers silently through his shameless infidelity, and the Corleone daughter, Connie, played by Talia Shire, is so often overlooked that her brothers take no notice of her unless she protests about her disgusting husband having beaten her.An assault on Vito's life alters Michael's attitude, and he comes back to help defend his family's wellbeing as Sonny takes rash control, making a mess of the business and laying everyone on the line, while the laid up and incapacitated Vito can do no more than look on. Michael's bona fide defining moment make its mark in one of the film's most unforgettable scenes of ultimate virtuosity. He takes it upon himself to do a hit at a small Italian restaurant, using a gun that was left for him in a bathroom stall. This forces him into banishment in Sicily, where he solidifies his determination to return his family to a status of eminence.

Predictably, the depressing but whimsical domestic drama provided his actress wife Joanne Woodward with a meaty central role of a delusional, alcoholic and widowed mother of two girls; she won the Best Actress award at the Cannes Film Festival and earned a nod at the Golden Globes but was curiously bypassed at the Oscars. The girls are played by Roberta Wallach (daughter of actors Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson) and the Newmans\u2019 own daughter, Nell Potts.The film may wallow in the family\u2019s squalid surroundings for the duration but is redeemed by disarmingly funny moments (Woodward\u2019s foul-mouthed tirades against rabbit crap all over the house, Wallach\u2019s uncanny imitation of her boorish mum for the benefit of her jeering schoolmates and the gleefully sadistic speech given by the little girl who boiled the skin off a cat for her science project!) and characters (the silent old lady they take on as a lodger). Another good sequence is when Woodward goes to her brother-in-law for a loan to start off her proposed tea-shop business and causes a scene in front of their guests.

The thing is, real life is so much darker.The acting from all concerned is faultless. Kevin Spacey plays Lester to perfection - the viewer understands exactly what Lester is going through, you are on his side even if his actions are not what you would find morally correct.

Saying that however, watching this film has made me very keen to see the musical in it's original format one day, and it is just a shame that it is no longer being shown in the West End.Whenever Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice get together for a musical, you know you're going to be in for a treat, and no matter what other reservations I have about this film, there is no doubting that musically, it is a masterpiece. There are many, very, very good songs, ('Oh, What a Circus' and 'I'd be Surprisingly Good for You', being two examples), which are only improved by casting Madonna as Eva (no matter what anyone may say about her acting, you cannot deny that her voice is sublime).

Heath Ledger gives a dazzling performance as usual (which is surprising considering how reluctant Ledger was to take the part in case he became typecast) but the real breath-taking performance for me was by Julia Stiles - it is only now I am older that I can appreciate just how believably she managed to pull off her character that you do not for an instance question whether she is the 'rude, aggressive, bitter older sister of the most popular girl at school who only behaves in this way as a defence mechanism'. The remainder of the cast, Jospeh Gordon-Levitt, Larisa Oleynik, David Krumholtz etc all play their parts perfectly, and with a true 90's script and killer soundtrack this film couldn't fail to be anything but a success.I guess that part of the appeal of this film for me is the fact that I grew up through my teenage years constantly watching it. If I was to be introduced to this film for the first time today, I am not sure whether I would like it anywhere near as much as I do now, but it has a certain sentimental value for me, and brings back many, many memories. And I have to say, in this genre of film, '10 Things I hate About You' will always come out on top. I guess that this film is my generations High School Musical, however, there is one key difference in my opinion - although this may be a teen chick flick it is in a class of it's own quality wise, and definitely should not be disregarded as anything less.

The remainder of the cast, Jospeh Gordon-Levitt, Larisa Oleynik, David Krumholtz etc all play their parts perfectly, and with a true 90's script and killer soundtrack this film couldn't fail to be anything but a success.I guess that part of the appeal of this film for me is the fact that I grew up through my teenage years constantly watching it. If I was to be introduced to this film for the first time today, I am not sure whether I would like it anywhere near as much as I do now, but it has a certain sentimental value for me, and brings back many, many memories. And I have to say, in this genre of film, '10 Things I hate About You' will always come out on top. I guess that this film is my generations High School Musical, however, there is one key difference in my opinion - although this may be a teen chick flick it is in a class of it's own quality wise, and definitely should not be disregarded as anything less.

I finally got around to watching 'Save the Last Dance', becoming quite tired of the 'How can you not have seen 'Save the Last Dance', it's the best dance film out there!' comments each time the film came up in conversation. And yes, I enjoyed it, it was a good, entertaining film, but it definitely was not one of the greatest things ever created and I don't think it deserves quite as much hype as it receives.The story line has become a cliché by now, girl and boy become romantically involved against a backdrop of dancing. I think that this was one of the first dance films of it's kind though, and you can almost feel that throughout the movie - it feels fresh and original, not like a carbon copy of an already done and dusted formula (such as 'How She Move' felt). Also, I think it's important to mention how influential this film was in encouraging more dance films to be made, some of them rather good too, like Step Up 1 + 2, Take the Lead, etc. However, by now the formula wears thin, and has been done too many times, so even whilst this film was one of the first in it's genre, a viewer watching this for the first time these days already knows what will happen at the end less than 10 minutes into the film, and that's definitely a let down (though, it's hardly a fault that the movie could have prevented, without foresight).The dancing is not the greatest I have ever seen in this genre of film, that would have to go, hands down, to the street-dancing in Step Up 2 (and I do believe that the ballet in Step Up 1 probably deserves second place) but it is good enough for the film, and definitely not the worse I have seen. In fact, Sara's final dance may be one of my favourite routines ever seen on film. I was very surprised to discover Julia Stiles was such a capable, and very skilled ballet dancer - her dancing impressed me far more than her acting in this film (which, although wasn't necessarily bad, was more of her same old style - it's as if she plays the same person in each role, who just happens to be in a completely new situation each time). Kerry Washington also impressed me as the confident, mouthy, and good at heart Chenille and I believe Sean Patrick Thomas also deserves a mention as Derek, as does Fedro Starr as Malakai.Overall, I did like this film, it was fast paced, intelligent, easy watching, and a welcome change to the recent films I have been watching lately which all feel much slower, and emotionally heavy. However, the plot gives this film it's limitations, and although for it's genre it is up there with the best, it's not a film that I would say deserves to be forever remembered in film history.

But as the film never once claims to be historically accurate, then I can't really complain about this and instead will take the film for what it is - a love story with a twist! The story goes that William Shakespeare is having writer's block and needs inspiration to help write his next play (which will end up being Romeo & Juliet). While watching the auditions for the part of Romeo, Shakespeare is dazzled by the talent of one boy - who turns out to actually be the beautiful Viola De Lesseps who has auditioned under the disguise of a man as women were not allowed to be actors in Shakespeare's day. Here starts the love story between William and Viola, finally giving Shakespeare the inspiration he needs to write Romeo and Juliet.The script is full of jokes and references that people who have studied Shakespeare will appreciate, but there's also plenty for the non-fans too to keep you occupied. Jospeh Fiennes did an OK job as Shakespeare but he was over-shadowed by not only Gwyneth Paltrow as Viola (I've never been a fan of Shakepeare but when she read his poems and speeches I fully understood the meaning of his words), and especially by Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth. What I especially liked was the ending to the story, which was not what I had expected to finally happen (but I guess, is more true to Shakespeare's life).A good film, but not great.

Well, what can I say - I'm sure this stuff must have had some sort of diverse effect on my mental well-being as a child, and I can say honestly had an effect on my sense of humour - I find this kind of stuff hilarious.Don't get me wrong, this film isn't great by any stretch of the imagination. The plot is horrifically predictable, the film just isn't very exciting, never seeming to go anywhere, never raising my excitement or getting me personally involved. But it is funny - full of dark, Gothic humour, and each actor embodies the famous characters to perfection - Uncle Fester is JUST as I remember him, Wednesday is the sharp and cynical older sister I always thought was oh-so cool (except, whilst I used to look up at her as being so old and mature when I was 5\/6 years old, I now realise that she was only a child), cousin IT was the memorable mound of walking hair, Thing the detached hand. It brought back loads of childhood memories, and brought many smiles to my lips, but still, the film isn't great, and it would be wrong for me to give it any more stars than 3 just because of nostalgia or sentimental value.I gotta say, something I had never paid attention to as a kid was the acting, but now I'm old enough to actually realise that the characters don't exist and are played by actors, I have to congratulate Raul Julia on his performance as Gomez. I only discovered today that Julia passed away in 1994, and though this unexpected news makes me sad, at least he left behind performances of which he could honestly be proud. The second is Elizabeth Wilson as Abigail Cravern - her ability to switch between accents is incredible (and especially admired by me, who can't even master a single accent correctly).Overall, this film is good, but not great.
