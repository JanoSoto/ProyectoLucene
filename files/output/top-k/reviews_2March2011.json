Few follow up on their promises, but I have many times before enjoyed a good visual trip. But is it right to adore a film for its visual craft alone? Maybe. But when it has the kind of substance that only a select few will see, then there's much reason for one to like it. I am referring to a film such as The Cell. This magnificent piece of cinematic eye-candy is some of the best I've seen in a while, and for quite some time this particular sense of whimsy remains consistent. This certainly helps the film a lot, since director Tarsem Singh, professionally known only by his first name, seems to have the born skill of artful filmmaking. You may not agree with me on my opinion, but I think The Cell is a mighty fine movie. It exists to thrill the audience with its visuals, and by all means it succeeds. I found myself captivated whenever Tarsem's unique and stunning visuals were on-screen, but a little bored when they weren't. This gives me a chance to say that while it's still wonderful and suitably grand on the visual scale, The Cell is not perfect. There were some points in the film's story where I felt more narrative detail was needed, and then, as I mentioned, there were times when the lack of amazing eye-candy really hurt the film's entertainment value. None the less, these are the kind of flaws I can easily forgive. I'm perhaps too forgiving of a film like this, but I'm not going to lie; I really enjoyed it. This is one of 2002's more unique films, if not one of its overall best. The Cell has none the less made me want to see more out of Tarsem, and it's also made me re-evaluate Jennifer Lopez and Vince Vaughn as actors\/actresses. Both have had their good days, and then their bad days, but this is one of those times where a director can master them to the best of their ability. This is a great film and Tarsem is a great director. It's not a movie that will appeal to just anyone, but then again what are visually trippy, wholesomely satisfactory cinematic films for? This is what I believe to be the work of a man who has alas been misunderstood by many. If you can look past some of the obvious plot flaws, then you'll most likely enjoy the trip while it lasts. It's not a film for everyone; some think of it as pretentious, overly-ambitious, and even boring. I think it's a pretty darn good film. And if it means anything, I suppose that counts for something.

Also like other Cameron films it's a special effects heavy action film. Although perhaps this is one of his least memorable. I have to confess to not being the director's biggest fan but I do admit that his films are at the very least competently made. This one is no different, but it doesn't have the ground-breaking CGI of T2, the unprecedented combination of state-of-the-art special effects with epic romantic narrative of Titanic or the in-your-face 3D of Avatar. It's a much more straight-forward action film, and one of the least ambitious films of Cameron's career. True Lies is as much an Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle as a James Cameron movie.The story that combines the action adventure lifestyle of its central spy with his domestic life is a typical Cameron move. His approach to action film-making has almost always incorporated strong female characters and\/or romantic angles. This is unusual in the action genre. But it perhaps goes some way to explain the enormous success of his films &#x96; they appeal to a much wider demographic than most films. While I am not particularly much of a fan of Cameron's work, I have to have some respect for this unusual approach. Whether or not it's a conscious decision based on making more money at the box office I simply cannot say but it does give his films uniqueness.As far as the thrills go, it's very much business as usual here but completely over-the-top. For action enthusiasts this will deliver the bacon I'm sure. For the likes of me it was efficiently entertaining enough, so I don't have too many complaints. Although it did seem to do that annoying action movie thing where it has about three false endings. One proper one would've been fine thank you very much. And of course there was also Jamie Lee Curtis' strip tease scene. An unusual scene for sure, while I do have to admit that her body was frankly outstanding, it did seem a little awkward and out-of-place.

Also like other Cameron films it's a special effects heavy action film. Although perhaps this is one of his least memorable. I have to confess to not being the director's biggest fan but I do admit that his films are at the very least competently made. This one is no different, but it doesn't have the ground-breaking CGI of T2, the unprecedented combination of state-of-the-art special effects with epic romantic narrative of Titanic or the in-your-face 3D of Avatar. It's a much more straight-forward action film, and one of the least ambitious films of Cameron's career. True Lies is as much an Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle as a James Cameron movie.The story that combines the action adventure lifestyle of its central spy with his domestic life is a typical Cameron move. His approach to action film-making has almost always incorporated strong female characters and\/or romantic angles. This is unusual in the action genre. But it perhaps goes some way to explain the enormous success of his films &#x96; they appeal to a much wider demographic than most films. While I am not particularly much of a fan of Cameron's work, I have to have some respect for this unusual approach. Whether or not it's a conscious decision based on making more money at the box office I simply cannot say but it does give his films uniqueness.As far as the thrills go, it's very much business as usual here but completely over-the-top. For action enthusiasts this will deliver the bacon I'm sure. For the likes of me it was efficiently entertaining enough, so I don't have too many complaints. Although it did seem to do that annoying action movie thing where it has about three false endings. One proper one would've been fine thank you very much. And of course there was also Jamie Lee Curtis' strip tease scene.

Chucky's girlfriend Tiffany takes his remains and stitches the doll back together before using the famous voodoo chant to bring him back to life. Tiffany ends up becoming a doll after Chucky kills her, but in order to become human again, they have to get a amulet which was buried with Charles Lee Ray (Chucky) years ago. We also meet two younger characters in love who end up driving the dolls to New Jersey where the body of Charles Lee Ray is buried.Several murders occur along the road trip with the two human characters unaware that the dolls are alive. Eventually the dolls reveal their true selves leading up to a rather interesting ending. The acting is very good in this one, and the voices by Dourif and Tilly are well done. Lots of comedy in this installment as well. That's really the difference between this one and the others. This is a horror comedy while the others were more horror thrillers. I personally liked the series the way it was, but there are some funny moments in Bride of Chucky.There are some gory death scenes which are done well. Much better than the third Child's Play. But it just doesn't feel like a Child's Play movie without the story of Chucky chasing Andy Barclay around trying to take over his body. The rules from the original story are changed.

As such, The Poseidon Adventure and this film usually are considered the best examples of the genre. Neither are great films, although The Towering Inferno has aged better than The Poseidon Adventure. A group of all-star luminaries gather for a gala celebration in the penthouse of the newly constructed world's tallest building in San Francisco, but due to the shoddy electrical work by craven Richard Chamberlain, a fire breaks out on one of the higher floors trapping everyone within the burning building.If your cup of tea is pyrotechnics, then this is definitely the film for you. Between the explosions, burning bodies and flaming people plummeting to their deaths, you will really have it made. More discerning viewers will have to take solace in the cast, the set design and a handful of exciting moments. The film is ridiculously long, a good deal of the time spent on rather pallid character development in the protracted opening. The writing is definitely not this film's strong point and barely holds attention until the next action piece.Unlike The Poseidon Adventure, where a number of the leads get killed by the climax - one has to really proceed down the cast list before encountering the first fatality among the supporting players. Apparently being a leading player has its rewards. Steve McQueen, as the fire chief, and Paul Newman, as the architect, are both first-rate, although they are really just cruising along on their substantial charisma rather than acting. William Holden as the owner of the building has it rougher. It is impossible to understand whether we are supposed to like him or not. He places people in jeopardy for his own selfish means and obviously bears some degree of culpability for the shoddy work in the building, but veers back and forth between being noble and obnoxious. It is terrific to see Fred Astaire back on screen (and in a non-musical role), but why is his role so forgettable? Given the outrageous length of the picture, he literally has nothing to do but make unconvincing goo-goo eyes at the younger Jennifer Jones, extinguish the flames on one stunt man and shake his head in regret...and that is it. For this, he got an Oscar Nomination? Richard Chamberlain is on hand as the typical one-note bad guy, while one cannot help but be pulled out of the action every time O.J. Simpson makes an appearance, for obvious reasons. Robert Vaughn's role as a compassionate politician seems to have mostly been left on the editing floor, while Robert Wagner's most memorable moment in the film is being incinerated.The actresses have almost nothing to do. Susan Blakely barely registers in the ill-defined role of Holden's ornamental daughter and Chamberlain's clueless wife. One wonders why Faye Dunaway is in this film at all, unless the boon of a love scene with Newman was too much to turn down. For the entire duration, her only personality trait is that she is Newman's girlfriend. She primps about in a designer gown and barely manages the feat of looking concerned. The film barely utilizes her at all and her fourth billing is a bit ludicrous. Jennifer Jones fares best as a secretary and Astaire's love interest. She plays the only character that seems to harbor a genuine emotion, gets to act heroically and participates in one of the film's most tense passages where she, Newman and two children must desperately make their way down a destroyed staircase over perilous drops. Her shock death later in the film seems more than a tad cheap as she is one of the few characters - other than the two male leads - to generate any rooting interest, and the film could easily have generated the same shock by shifting the dramatic death to Dunaway - thus giving her character at least some reason for being in the film.The final moments of the film are indeed thrilling and the elevator rescue is also notable.

I was only 7½ years old when that renowned comedian passed away, and I never heard his name until probably several years later. It wasn't until over a decade after his premature death when I finally discovered how talented he was by seeing episodes of SCTV and the 1987 John Hughes film, Planes, Trains & Automobiles. However, I was obviously in no hurry to see Who's Harry Crumb? since it's been probably about five years since I first heard of it and I've finally just seen it for the first time. This is not one of Candy's more popular movies, and unsurprisingly not one that I like.Jennifer Downing is the daughter of a millionaire named P.J. Downing, and one day, during a mud massage at a health spa, she is kidnapped! When P.J. seeks help from the Crumb & Crumb detective agency, Eliot Draisen, the president of this agency, puts Harry Crumb on the case. Harry comes from a long family line of skilled detectives, but unfortunately, he hasn't inherited the skills of his predecessors. Although this man means well, he is actually a very clumsy and incompetent detective, and there's a good chance he will louse up this mission! He begins his investigation not knowing that the reason why Eliot put him on the case is because the president of Crumb & Crumb is secretly behind this kidnapping of the young heiress, so he actually wants the investigation to fail! Eliot is well aware of Harry's incompetence, and feels that with him on the case, there's no chance that the mission will be a successful one! In this 1989 crime comedy, John Candy plays a kind of character he was very well known to play, a clumsy but well-meaning and kind-hearted one. He sure was good at this role, but didn't always play it in good movies. This film is unfortunately one of the unfunny ones he starred in. Near the beginning, the part where Harry crashes through the window of an arguing couple made me laugh a little, and what is perhaps the funniest part takes place very shortly after that, when the incompetent detective accuses a woman named Mrs. MacIntyre of having an affair with her own husband! However, I don't think I laughed at all after that, apart from one scene much later in the film, and even that laugh was small. The vast majority of Who's Harry Crumb? didn't even make me smile. There's a lot of slapstick here, but it's generally cheap slapstick, and there are also some fairly poor quality lines, such as the really corny cherry Coke one. In addition to being unfunny, this movie is also usually quite boring.Planes, Trains & Automobiles is an excellent comedy and definitely the best film I've ever seen John Candy in. Uncle Buck is another John Hughes film starring Candy, and I found that one to be pretty good when I saw it for the first time last year. Who's Harry Crumb? came out the same year as Uncle Buck, but sadly, it's significantly weaker. Although Candy basically plays the same kind of character here as he does in the two Hughes comedies I've mentioned, and the late comedian's talent was a big help in both of those, he couldn't save this film. Even if you have found Candy hilarious in certain other works, which I would say I have, you could still easily be disappointed by this particular comedy which he starred in.

I concede that it has a special, time transcending message and it should be seen in that light. Seen in the hippie context, this is definitely a dated movie, but the message of peace, mutual respect for different people is as relevant today world as it was back in the 70s. I won't deny that many elements in the movie put me off. For a start I am tired of seeing solid, conservative folks painted with the 'bigoted redneck' brush and the free living, hash smoking, loose morals, no rules crowd playing the cool card. It's just too hard to swallow and just too glibly done. But place this in the same bracket of Easy rider and it starts making sense. It's one thing to frown at people who dress, live differently and another thing entirely when disapproval crosses the line and turns to burning hatred and that is what those townspeople stood for. Hatred! Coming to characters, Billy's is beautifully etched. As a big admirer of American Indian culture and heritage, this is one of the most satisfying Injun roles I have seen. I loved him and had I been Injun (I actually am Asian Indian) a poster of Billy Jack would have adorned my living room.The movie makers achieve perfection with the female roles. All the women really excelled in their pacifist roles. They were so convincing, their inner strength coming through and almost, though not quite, overshadowing their physical beauty. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the men playing the pacifist roles. It's a tragedy what they did to that nice Injun boy Martin. The girls completely emasculated him. Very rarely do pacifist men shine whether in reel or real life. It doesn't matter which era you live in, if a man cannot or does not want to defend his women against danger, he has no business chaperoning them. And that spiel he gave Barbara in the stable about wanting her to sleep with him for love rather than for the excitement was a little too much to digest. Bernard the villain of the piece was dealt a poor hand. In the first scene, he gives the impression of that rare inner strength which movie rednecks uniformly lack. He openly defies his rotten father and refuses to shoot the helpless mustangs. But after that first shot, in scene after scene he descends lower and lower on the humanity ladder until he is finally killed like a dog. In complete contradiction to scene one he is totally comfortable shooting a crippled Martin and has no problem taking orders from his father either, later on in the movie. Even after the attempted and successful rape scenes, it still is difficult to hate him because he is not convincing as a baddie. What were they thinking?!? It's like the makers started out giving him an angle that would let him throw in his lot with the goodies in the end but half way through they changed their minds. The way his role panned out made the first scene a waste of time. Barbara's father, the Sheriff's deputy had the rottenest deal in the movie. How, according to the pacifists, was he expected to react to his daughter announcing that she got knocked up by different people of several races and has no clue who the father of her child is? Was he supposed to pat her on the back and say Now Now or send her to bed without supper? Granted that he was corrupt and weak but any normal parent may have done the same, especially with the insolent manner she announces it. So she runs away from her father and the pacifist group help hide her. I don't care what your political leanings are but promiscuity especially in a minor cannot be condoned. And when he gets shot in the gun fight, the girl doesn't turn a hair. One cannot help feeling irritated with Barbara who defies her father for no good reason other than to cause him pain and anger. A rebel without a cause.Sheriff Cole was awesome in the Atticus Finch like role. He reminded strongly of John Wayne. Delores Taylor was very convincing in parts but recedes into a teary eyed nag in the end. And there is a little too much of in-your&#x96;face moral superiority from the pacifist brigade for this movie to work today. And I have heard of hunters but it seems really odd that anyone would herd animals into a corral and shoot them for 6¢ a pound. That would fetch roughly $40 for an adult horse. Bernard's dad is surely too rich to be taking all that trouble for collecting dog meat? So this scene just made no sense to me.

How does he fare from his first outing? Well, pretty much the same. For those who read my review of Live and Let Die, I wrote that I would further get into the character that Roger Moore brought to Bond. Before I get on with reviewing Man with the Golden Gun, let me state that Moore's portrayal of 007 is more comedic and cocky than what Connery brought. This works to some degree yet I have also found it to be somewhat overused as well. You see much of Bond's arrogance in Man with the Golden Gun probably more so than the future bond films that follow. Does this ruin the overall experience? No, it doesn't. However, it does affect my rating for this movie in particular. This is especially the case with the character of the British Agent known as Goodnight. This was her only appearance and I'm glad. Her character while certainly attractive was simply annoying to me for reasons that I won't go into because it would somewhat give spoilers for those who haven't seen this. All that being said, there is much to like about Man with the Golden Gun which is why I generously give it 8 out of 10 stars. For one, a trend that we see in the Roger Moore series is the return of certain characters for later films other than Felix Lighter and the British secret service. In Golden Gun, we get the return of J.W. Pepper from Live and Let Die. Now some reviewers and critics have stated that Pepper's return wasn't needed. While that might be true, I still found him enjoyable especially when he and Bond play off each other. Now getting to the other main character and memorable villain of the Bond franchise... Christopher Lee as Scaramanga. To me, this character is part of why I generously give Golden Gun my preferred rating. If I may go off subject for a moment, Christopher Lee was outstanding as the villains he played; mainly Dracula from the Hammer series. For him to have played Dracula eight times says something about the performance he put into that character. OK, now back to the subject at hand... The famous duel near the end of Golden Gun is still exciting as when I first viewed it. As for the other characters in Man with the Golden Gun, most are somewhat interesting except for Agent Goodnight. While some will not agree with me on this, they can at least agree that her character did not add anything significant to the franchise although it could be argued that a number of Bond girls were no different in that aspect. Despite the minor flaws, the major attributes are what make Man with the Golden Gun worthy of the 007 series. In fact, Man with the Golden Gun contains the second of the James Bond theme songs that I really like with the first being the theme song from Goldfinger.

Before I get on with reviewing Man with the Golden Gun, let me state that Moore's portrayal of 007 is more comedic and cocky than what Connery brought. This works to some degree yet I have also found it to be somewhat overused as well. You see much of Bond's arrogance in Man with the Golden Gun probably more so than the future bond films that follow. Does this ruin the overall experience? No, it doesn't. However, it does affect my rating for this movie in particular. This is especially the case with the character of the British Agent known as Goodnight. This was her only appearance and I'm glad. Her character while certainly attractive was simply annoying to me for reasons that I won't go into because it would somewhat give spoilers for those who haven't seen this. All that being said, there is much to like about Man with the Golden Gun which is why I generously give it 8 out of 10 stars. For one, a trend that we see in the Roger Moore series is the return of certain characters for later films other than Felix Lighter and the British secret service. In Golden Gun, we get the return of J.W. Pepper from Live and Let Die. Now some reviewers and critics have stated that Pepper's return wasn't needed. While that might be true, I still found him enjoyable especially when he and Bond play off each other. Now getting to the other main character and memorable villain of the Bond franchise... Christopher Lee as Scaramanga. To me, this character is part of why I generously give Golden Gun my preferred rating. If I may go off subject for a moment, Christopher Lee was outstanding as the villains he played; mainly Dracula from the Hammer series. For him to have played Dracula eight times says something about the performance he put into that character. OK, now back to the subject at hand... The famous duel near the end of Golden Gun is still exciting as when I first viewed it. As for the other characters in Man with the Golden Gun, most are somewhat interesting except for Agent Goodnight. While some will not agree with me on this, they can at least agree that her character did not add anything significant to the franchise although it could be argued that a number of Bond girls were no different in that aspect. Despite the minor flaws, the major attributes are what make Man with the Golden Gun worthy of the 007 series. In fact, Man with the Golden Gun contains the second of the James Bond theme songs that I really like with the first being the theme song from Goldfinger. I will include preferences to other Bond theme songs in my future reviews of the 007 franchise.

It's a very corny and sentimental retelling of the landing in Normandy during World War II and subsequent battles in France. The film starts and closes in a veterans cemetery during the present times (that is, around the time it was filmed), and perhaps one of the reasons that the filmmakers made it so sentimental is that around the time it was released, and for obvious biological reasons, many WW2 veterans started dying. I remember that another film dealing with World War II was released at around the same time, Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line, which dealt with the war in the Pacific and it was far more gripping and stronger and far less sentimental movie. Private Ryan opens with a now famous scene of the landing in Normandy that is very well done, but the film sort of goes downhill (though not catastrophically) from there on. The character of the German prisoner, for instance, is very crudely written and performed. I have to say, however, that one thing that impressed me about the movie is that it shows American soldiers killing German soldiers as they were surrendering. This undoubtedly happened quite a lot in World War II (and in many wars, I suppose), yet few films show such things. And Spielberg shows this matter of factly, he doesn't give moral judgment on this. For this honesty, I praise the movie. But on balance, I think this movie is only fair.

A 50's mother begins to realize her perfect little daughter isn't what she seems. And on a parallel plane, she also comes to realize her own past is not what it seems. And when these 2 plot arcs finally merge, you have one hell of a climax. Director Mervyn LeRoy made the decision to film this as the staged play it once was. There were few attempts to open it up and few close ups. The film is composed of mostly medium shots. Most of the Broadway cast was also imported for the film and act accordingly (to the upper balcony). Particularly lead Nancy Kelly as the put upon mom. Her hand wringing\/chest beating performance is over the top, yet it works wonderfully in this 50s setting. It's too bad the censors made them change the ending. But even the changed ending packs its own wallop. This piece of Eisenhower Americana (turned on its head), hints at the tumultuous 60s decade ahead. There are wonderful bits by Eileen Heckart, hilarious and heartbreaking almost simultaneously as the drunken, grieving Hortense Daigle (who came up with that name? LOL) and Henry Jones as the mentally challenged handyman (who catches on quite quickly to the goings on when the so-called smarter characters are still clueless); Evelyn Varden as the nosy, psychoanalyzing landlady, and of course, Patty McCormack giving one of the most chilling portrayals of childhood mayhem ever put on screen. Alex North's score helps the proceedings immeasurably. As an artifact of the 50s and precursor of many film genres since, this movie is hard to beat! Even the tacked on Let's Meet the Cast (It's Only A Movie!) epilogue cant spoil it. It's a great ride.

It has some good actors in it that later on go on to even more things. The movie is absolutely hilarious but also teaches kids a good story. It takes a team who doesn't know anything about soccer and turns them into champions. It is very interesting to see everything they have to go through to get there. Loved it as a child. Even if you are not a soccer fan it's a great movie to watch. It sends kids a good message. Even as an adult I still love it. Recommended for children of all ages! It teaches you about teamwork and hard work can pay off in the end!
