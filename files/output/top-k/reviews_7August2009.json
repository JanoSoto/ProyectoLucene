After seeing the rest of Wes Anderson's films- and getting older- I watched Rushmore again and fell in love with it. No review could capture all the greatness that happens here... this is a movie you have to see to decide for yourself.How could I describe the film? There is no easy plot summary.. It's about Max Fischer, a high-school boy, but by no means is this a teen movie... in fact, it's more of a retro-active reflection on teenage years, or maybe a retro-active fantasy... Who among us doesn't wish we could go back and be involved in more school clubs and activities, that we had the presence of mind to acquaint ourselves with art and literature, that we had the courage and wisdom at that age to fight to save Latin? Max may be the embodiment of the stop and smell the roses philosophy, but he unconsciously rejects conventional wisdom and authority... in spite of his passion for his school's cultural and educational sideshows he's failing all his classes. Max's extra-curriculars aren't for his college transcript, he's doing this for himself. For his character the knowledge and experience are their own reward and not a trophy to be waved in someone's face. How do we know this? The only time Max becomes an obnoxious braggart about his accomplishments is when he's threatened by the doctor-boyfriend of the woman he loves. I wrote a hit play and directed it... so I'm not sweating it either!Beside the beautiful sentiment behind a character who is passionate about learning and strives to better himself while improving the institution for his schoolmates we get a love story, perhaps the most complex love story I can remember. Max's crush on Ms. Cross is at first dismissed as just a lonely schoolboy's puppy love, and yet the more the two interact the less absurd the relationship becomes. He may only be 15, but he may also be the only man who truly understands her and can truly love her. Or is there an element of Max assembling an alternative family, with Ms. Cross as the Mother he lost at age 7, and Mr. Blume the Father he's proud to show the world because of his wealth and stature?Max's biggest weakness is the shame he feels over his real Father, a lowly barber who will never understand the things Max is dying to understand. It's one of the sweetest, most human sequences in the film when Max finally accepts his Father and reveals him to the world... it seems like this Father-figure theme is a recurring one in Wes Anderson films Mr. Henry in Bottle Rocket, Royal in The Royal Tenenbaums, the deceased Mr. Whitman in Darjeeling Limited and Steve & Ned's relationship in The Life Aquatic. Like in all his movies, Anderson underplays the most heartfelt, moving scenes here there are no lingering closeups or drawn-out melodramatics... Max may be willing to end his war with Mr. Blume but he had still planned to drop a tree on him.By the time of the film's finale, Max- a master at scripting his life as if it were a play- has finally accepted his limitations of age, wealth, and ability, but still insists on transcending them all to share his greatness with the world... after all, he has no right to keep it to himself. The grand opening of his play, his magnum opus, is an excuse to unite all the characters in his life and make them see who he his all the glory and fear, all the wisdom and naiveté, all the sorrow and joy... or maybe the play was just a stage direction in Max's bigger script, a script not even Ms. Cross could see coming until the film's glorious final moment, a moment so perfectly conceived by Max that it's not just a work of art, it's a work of a life.Rushmore is brilliant, rich, rewarding, hilarious, original, and unbelievably beautiful.

I like it even more today. This is the story of two gay men in the early 20th Century, how they fall in love, how they fall apart, and how they eventually take very different paths. One that leads to a life of sadness and regret. The other to acceptance, love, and fulfillment. James Wilby gives a powerful performance as Maurice, a middle class gentleman who discovers his homosexuality while away for college at Cambridge University. It is there he meets and falls in love with Clive Durham, played brilliantly by Hugh Grant, an upper class gentleman who lives in a decaying English manor, called Pendersligh Park, that was built by his grandfather's grandfather. They enter into a passionate, albeit sexless, relationship that most viewers will see as doomed from the start. Maurice, once he overcomes his internal conflict over who and what he actually is, is drowning in love for Clive. Clive on the other hand, though he is in love with Maurice, is perhaps more in love with the idea of Maurice, than Maurice himself. When outside circumstances intervene, their world together comes crashing down, and the results are painful for both. One of the plot devices that I found intriguing, and not having read the book I don't know if it is part of the original story, is Simcox, Clive's butler, played menacingly and effectively by Patrick Godfrey. He informs the viewer of the disapproval and judgment directed at Maurice and Clive that IS Edwardian England. Simcox delivers even the most banal lines with an almost imperceptible sneer. Even when he has no lines he is lurking in the background of the scene with a stone cold gaze that says, I know what you're up to. He is the warden. Edwardian England is the prison. And Pendersleigh Park is Clives cell.I missed many of the finer points of this film the first time I saw it in 1987. Back then the ending disappointed me because I identified with Maurice and I felt like he waked away with the second prize, Alec Scudder. And Clive caved to the pressures of Edwardian England and entered into a marriage he was never suited for. All of that was true then, and is still true today. However, with 20 plus years of maturation behind me I now understand that when the credits role at the end of this film Clive is as deeply in love with Maurice as he ever was. The finale of the film is a window into the lifeless, hopeless, longing, that is Clive's future, contrasted with that of the fulfillment and joy that will be Maurice's. After Clive and Maurice have their final words, Clive returns to his waiting wife inside Pendersleigh. Simcox asks, will there will be anything else sir?, and then proceeds to close the house shutters for the night. You can almost hear the sound of cell doors closing for lights out in a penitentiary. Clive approaches his wife, who is seated in front of her vanity mirror. He leans in to kiss her cheek and they look up together into the mirror in front of them. They expect to see a happy couple. They don't. There is a sadness in Clive's eyes that they are both unprepared for. It is more shocking to Clive because now he is no longer fooling even himself. He pulls uncomfortably away from his wife and like a prisoner resigned to his confinement, he finishes closing the shutters, (the cell doors of Pendersleigh) one by one. As he comes to the last one he takes a final look out the window at freedom. Clive has chosen to accept society, and turn its turmoil toward him inward where he will always be conflicted and never know a moment of peace. Maurice has decided to accept who he is and deal with the turmoil in the world outside. It is heartbreaking. James Wilby carries this movie from start to finish. As Maurice it is his story to tell and tell it he does. From adolescent bewilderment, to revulsion with Clive's initial advances, to falling in love with Clive, then heartbreak, and finally to his own sunset to walk into. He never has a foot out of place. It is an honest and compelling performance. But it is Hugh Grant's complex and multi layered Clive that you're left with ricocheting around in your soul. When Clive says to Maurice, It's like the good blundering creature that you are to try and comfort me, but there are limits, Grant conveys a sense of defeat, resignation, and emptiness that is almost too difficult to watch. At times he stares very far away. Probably to the place where he wishes he could be, but seems impossible to reach. I think because initially I was so personally disappointed in his characters evolution throughout the course of the movie, that I missed what a brilliant performance this was. Forgive me Mr. Grant. You are a truly talented actor.This is a brilliant film. It's all there beautiful story, beautiful landscape cinematography, great script(small problem though with the editing and non-sequitur dialog when Scudder meets Maurice in London), great direction, perfect score, and above all two brilliant performances from James Wilby and Hugh Grant and many others in the supporting cast.

","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"7 August 2009","score":"9 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" THE MONSTER CLUB is the final movie from the excellent British movie production company, Amicus.Although the movie is an anthology, opinion is divided as to whether or not it forms part of the Amicus anthology canon.I see THE MONSTER CLUB as a separate movie from the remainder of the Amicus anthologies. However, it is a highly entertaining final movie from Amicus. I'm truly puzzled as to why the movie was not successful financially.The single greatest idea behind THE MONSTER CLUB is the combination of three elements - traditional British horror Amicus is famous for, the darkest of dark humour and a collection of fine examples of 1980s disco music.There are only three stories in this compendium, rather than the usual four or five seen in Amicus movies. However the stories, along with the linking story, are so entertaining that this is easily overlooked.The linking story sees Ronald Chetwynd-Hayes, a character based on a real horror story author of the same name, who is attacked in the street by a sinister character named Eramus. When he wakes up after a vampire bite, the author discovers Eramus is a vampire. Ermaus promises to repay him by inviting him to a disco known as The Monster Club, where he assures him there will be plenty of material for a new book of horror stories. Vincent Price and John Carradine are on top form in their roles as Eramus and Ronald Chetwynd-Hayes respectively.The Monster Club is full of famous horror creations of various types including vampires, werewolves and ghouls. Disco music blends well with the setting, with almost all songs having a horror theme to them. The costumes are unbelievably cheesy but this is easily overlooked by the uplifting feeling of the disco atmosphere. As an added bonus, the movie brings something unique here - a monster genealogical chart.The first story sees Barbara Kellerman and Simon Ward as a pair of opportunists looking to take some rich person for all he or she is worth. Eventually Kellerman's character comes into contact with an eccentric man who lives in a large Gothic house. Without revealing spoilers, I can say that he turns out to be a shadmock, a hybrid of various creatures including vampires, werewolves and ghouls. James Laurenson gives a supreme performance as the shadmock, a kindly and gentle creature, who is simply uncomfortable with being outside his house. Predictably, the tale becomes a tragic love story that is so emotionally moving I was actually in tears when the ending came.The second story takes a different course to the first with more dark humour. Richard Johnson has a great time playing the vampire father of a young boy, Lintom. He goes out at night hunting for blood, whilst telling his son that he is working. Britt Ekland plays Lintom's mother but she has very little to do here. Lintom finds himself being bullied at school because he is quiet and shy. He is rescued from torment by a priest, played by Donald Pleasance in another of his superb performances. I will give away no further details. But I'll say that this story was highly enjoyable due to its tongue-in-cheek approach not only to vampire clichés but to clichés of another genre as well. Look out for Anthony Valentine and Neil McCarthy having fun as a pair of vampire hunters dressed up as undertakers who carry violin cases! The final story is easily the darkest and best of the three. Stuart Whitman is cast perfectly as an impatient movie director looking for a remote location to make an atmospheric horror movie. His impatience with his crew leads him to seek out the location himself. We get to see some of the beautiful English countryside as he drives down a country lane hoping to find a remote village at the end. What he finds in reality is a very strange foggy place with only an old crumbling inn, a church and a graveyard. There is more to this atmospheric location than meets the eye. I will spoil no more of this story as this is one you'll want to see for yourself without warnings. But I will say a few things about the characters. The innkeeper is a very sinister character, played perfectly by the always great Patrick Magee. Lesley Dunlop deserves credit for her superb performance early in her career as the innkeeper's daughter, a hybrid of a human and a ghoul.Roy Ward Baker directs Amicus's final movie perfectly. He demonstrates a clear understanding of the various subject matters - Gothic horror, dark humour and 1980s disco entertainment, directing each element accordingly. As a result, he guarantees the three blend well enough to produce a highly entertaining piece of entertainment worthy of a final movie for such a great horror production company.Douglas Gamley, an Amicus veteran, produces some excellent background music to the movie including an excellent score. His choice of music in the first story blends perfectly with the Gothic setting and the tragic love story theme.As was the case with previous Amicus movies, this one makes excellent use of classical music. These blend perfectly with the settings.Kudos to the music bands - The Viewers, Night and The Pretty Things - whose catchy tunes make this movie worth watching by virtue of their presence alone. Special kudos as well to 1980s singer, B.A. Robertson, whose song - Sucker For Your Love - performed after the first story is easily the best of his career.Overall, THE MONSTER CLUB is a highly entertaining final movie from Amicus and a must-see for all fans of movies made by this great movie production company. I especially recommend it for fans of Vincent Price and John Carradine who have a superb time in this late stage of their careers.

Britt Ekland plays Lintom's mother but she has very little to do here. Lintom finds himself being bullied at school because he is quiet and shy. He is rescued from torment by a priest, played by Donald Pleasance in another of his superb performances. I will give away no further details. But I'll say that this story was highly enjoyable due to its tongue-in-cheek approach not only to vampire clichés but to clichés of another genre as well. Look out for Anthony Valentine and Neil McCarthy having fun as a pair of vampire hunters dressed up as undertakers who carry violin cases! The final story is easily the darkest and best of the three. Stuart Whitman is cast perfectly as an impatient movie director looking for a remote location to make an atmospheric horror movie. His impatience with his crew leads him to seek out the location himself. We get to see some of the beautiful English countryside as he drives down a country lane hoping to find a remote village at the end. What he finds in reality is a very strange foggy place with only an old crumbling inn, a church and a graveyard. There is more to this atmospheric location than meets the eye. I will spoil no more of this story as this is one you'll want to see for yourself without warnings. But I will say a few things about the characters. The innkeeper is a very sinister character, played perfectly by the always great Patrick Magee. Lesley Dunlop deserves credit for her superb performance early in her career as the innkeeper's daughter, a hybrid of a human and a ghoul.Roy Ward Baker directs Amicus's final movie perfectly. He demonstrates a clear understanding of the various subject matters - Gothic horror, dark humour and 1980s disco entertainment, directing each element accordingly. As a result, he guarantees the three blend well enough to produce a highly entertaining piece of entertainment worthy of a final movie for such a great horror production company.Douglas Gamley, an Amicus veteran, produces some excellent background music to the movie including an excellent score. His choice of music in the first story blends perfectly with the Gothic setting and the tragic love story theme.As was the case with previous Amicus movies, this one makes excellent use of classical music. These blend perfectly with the settings.Kudos to the music bands - The Viewers, Night and The Pretty Things - whose catchy tunes make this movie worth watching by virtue of their presence alone. Special kudos as well to 1980s singer, B.A. Robertson, whose song - Sucker For Your Love - performed after the first story is easily the best of his career.Overall, THE MONSTER CLUB is a highly entertaining final movie from Amicus and a must-see for all fans of movies made by this great movie production company. I especially recommend it for fans of Vincent Price and John Carradine who have a superb time in this late stage of their careers. ","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"7 August 2009","score":"9 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" THE MONSTER CLUB is the final movie from the excellent British movie production company, Amicus.Although the movie is an anthology, opinion is divided as to whether or not it forms part of the Amicus anthology canon.I see THE MONSTER CLUB as a separate movie from the remainder of the Amicus anthologies. However, it is a highly entertaining final movie from Amicus. I'm truly puzzled as to why the movie was not successful financially.The single greatest idea behind THE MONSTER CLUB is the combination of three elements - traditional British horror Amicus is famous for, the darkest of dark humour and a collection of fine examples of 1980s disco music.There are only three stories in this compendium, rather than the usual four or five seen in Amicus movies. However the stories, along with the linking story, are so entertaining that this is easily overlooked.The linking story sees Ronald Chetwynd-Hayes, a character based on a real horror story author of the same name, who is attacked in the street by a sinister character named Eramus. When he wakes up after a vampire bite, the author discovers Eramus is a vampire. Ermaus promises to repay him by inviting him to a disco known as The Monster Club, where he assures him there will be plenty of material for a new book of horror stories. Vincent Price and John Carradine are on top form in their roles as Eramus and Ronald Chetwynd-Hayes respectively.The Monster Club is full of famous horror creations of various types including vampires, werewolves and ghouls. Disco music blends well with the setting, with almost all songs having a horror theme to them. The costumes are unbelievably cheesy but this is easily overlooked by the uplifting feeling of the disco atmosphere. As an added bonus, the movie brings something unique here - a monster genealogical chart.The first story sees Barbara Kellerman and Simon Ward as a pair of opportunists looking to take some rich person for all he or she is worth. Eventually Kellerman's character comes into contact with an eccentric man who lives in a large Gothic house. Without revealing spoilers, I can say that he turns out to be a shadmock, a hybrid of various creatures including vampires, werewolves and ghouls. James Laurenson gives a supreme performance as the shadmock, a kindly and gentle creature, who is simply uncomfortable with being outside his house. Predictably, the tale becomes a tragic love story that is so emotionally moving I was actually in tears when the ending came.The second story takes a different course to the first with more dark humour. Richard Johnson has a great time playing the vampire father of a young boy, Lintom. He goes out at night hunting for blood, whilst telling his son that he is working. Britt Ekland plays Lintom's mother but she has very little to do here. Lintom finds himself being bullied at school because he is quiet and shy.

Unfortunately Poltergeist doesn't offer something that good.My main complaint is that characters are poorly portrayed For example, you could easily remove older daughter(Dana) character from the story and no one would notice - she had nearly no lines, and you can't really tell anything about her - the only thing you'll know that she might have a boyfriend, and that's all. Even her personality is enigma. Same thing goes with other 3 main characters - it almost looks like as if their main purpose was to scream sometimes. Sure, Diana and Steve has some dialogs where pieces of their background pops up, but even after that they doesn't make any sense. There are many people that literally work as an element of backdrop, adding little to the story. Take Steve's boss for example - this guy is supposed to be business shark or something (after all, he is responsible for all problems), but he doesn't even look like a bad guy, because he doesn't have any character portrayed - he drops few occasional remarks, seems to care about having Steve as employee, but that is all. You don't know if he is obsessed with money or something - the movie doesn't tell you.There are also a lot of problems with the story and directing. The story leaves a lot of things unexplained (which isn't bad in some cases), but doesn't provide any clues to make your own explanation. Instead of adding elements of mystery, a lot of things doesn't make any sense. For example, why ghosts attacked only after the storm if the house was standing on the graveyard all that time? Why people that dug up the pool didn't find any corpses? Who is that dark presence? And why ghosts came back after that psychic character told as that this house is clean? Why did ghosts attack Steve's family instead of going after his boss (who is responsible)? And why did ghosts destroyed the house? And why they didn't kill the family right away instead of playing with chairs? There are a lot of questions like that, and they don't have reasonable explanation.Directing is very inconsistent. Beginning of the movie looks reasonable enough, and even has some good scenes (for example, when Steve sees moving chair - looks great). Once paranormal investigators arrive, the movie looks pathetic - because characters act unnatural, especially at the moment when that small clairvoyant character starts explaining what is going on - at that moment there are five people silently listening (looks extremely unnatural), and director's attempt to add atmosphere by playing music in background only ruins scene further. The problem is that the dialog of psychic character at that point is extremely weak. For example for her it simply is another child. To us ... it is the beast, at that point we see horrified face of Diane Freeling with tears. For me her reaction doesn't match the words, and looks like overreacting. Because of this the whole explanation scene looks pathetic and might provoke occasional laugh at best, but won't make you feel horror of situation. Also there are certain annoying clichés in that part of the movie (like two people kiss in the beam of light before one of them goes into dangerous situation), and several pitiful attempts to make me feel compassion (I'm not heartless, you just have to try harder and avoid clichés). Last 30 minutes looks like another movie directed by different person. Suddenly we see main heroine in the bath (no nudity, but it still looks pretty strange compared to previous hour of the movie), there are suddenly a lot of corpses in coffins popping out of ground, action, destruction, although movie could have ended several minutes ago (remember that psychic said this house is clean?). Although those last minutes look much better than the rest of the movie (at least I wasn't bored to death anymore at that point), they look too different, and doesn't match the mood of other parts of the movie. And there is another problem. Movie was released in 1982, so ghosts and moving furniture alone wouldn't work for modern generation that is used to shooting all kind of unholy abominations in computer games (including moving furniture and Lucifer himself). I had only one cheap scare during the whole movie (the second scene with the clown). Right now Poltergeist will be probably scary for kids, or people that are not into video games or horror movies. Movies like already mentioned The Thing and Hellraiser still work for people not because they have astonishing special effects or gore, but because they offer unusual story, nice world, good mystery, great characters, they are solid and because of this they are still enjoyable. In Poltergeist, however, I did not find anything like that. Maybe it had good special effects back in 1982, but right now it has nothing else to offer. Not for me, at least. Of course, there are many movies that are much worse than Poltergeist, but I'd still prefer to watch something better.

Great emotional drama of an event which shows how our own race can be so destructive to the point where leaders can display their selfish principles in pursuit of power, decide the worth of their personal living, and ultimately those of the fate of their own kind.Very tear jerking scene towards the end in which Lt. Holmes and wife Mary confront the final plight of their lives together and re-affirm their vows of genuine love for each other.This movie was derived from the talents of absolutely brilliant novelist Nevil Shute who wrote the original book, translated into a magnificent production and direction by Stanley Kramer with the added musical tune of our proud now alternative national theme Waltzing Matilda played at those important intervals to such effect, which just makes this movie click perfectly.P.S. I have a minor connection to this film through my brother in law who is Spanish by birth and was a very young refugee of the Civil War in his country in 1936. Twice he tried to stowaway on board a ship to the U.S. but was discovered and returned home. He later stowed to Australia, and accepted as an immigrant refugee, got a job as a dishwasher in a high class Melbourne Restaurant in the early 1950's. Through hard work he was eventually promoted to head drink table waiter and was personally assigned to serving Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner, and Anthony Perkins who regularly dined there after their daily filming roles for this movie.Ava Gardner made it quite clear to the management of the restaurant that she would only dine there if my brother in law (Tony) would be her personal waiter. He did well in salary and tips for that recommendation.I believe she had a great attraction for Spanish gentlemen, well reflected in some of the movies she made during her time.There is a street in the Melbourne suburb of Berwick where a lot of this filming took place, and under development at that time, and had her name - Gardner Street - placed up in the honor of her contribution to the role she played in this local production.

He did well in salary and tips for that recommendation.I believe she had a great attraction for Spanish gentlemen, well reflected in some of the movies she made during her time.There is a street in the Melbourne suburb of Berwick where a lot of this filming took place, and under development at that time, and had her name - Gardner Street - placed up in the honor of her contribution to the role she played in this local production. Even Stanley Kramer got his last name on a street there for his contribution.Great movie, well done in black and white - watch it and see for yourself. You wont be disappointed.

One of the few 80s films that I think is REQUIRED viewing, especially by wannabe filmmakers, BEETLEJUICE is a prime example of less is more. With a relatively unknown (at the time) cast, cheap claymation effects, cartoony cardboard sets, simple location shooting, and I'll bet made in a short period of time with the most simple script, Burton has fashioned one of the most original films in the last 30 years! BEETLEJUICE is most certainly Burton's most purely entertaining film AND his oddest. It perhaps is the REAL Tim Burton at play. While films like BATMAN, ED WOOD, SLEEPY HOLLOW all have the Hollywood feel about them, BEETLEJUICE is the perhaps Burton's most personal film. It all feels totally HIM.BEETLEJUICE is an amalgamation of comedy, horror, ghost story, animation, AND its a family film...weird?! It tells the tale of New Englanders Adam and Barbara Maitland (played with refreshing, confident, sublime glee by film newbies Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis), who die at the film's outset in a bridge accident and spend the bulk of the film as ghosts haunting their home of its new inhabitants. They are the Deetzes daffy Charles (wacky Jeffrey Jones), his annoying wife Delia (hilarious Catherine O'Hara), and weird, goth teen daughter Lydia (brilliant newcomer Winona Ryder).The eclectic supporting cast also includes Glenn Shadix as Otho, and the iconic entertainers Dick Cavett and Robert Goulet and veteran actress Sylvia Sydney...Odd, strange, yet utterly brilliant casting! But the casting coup is the actor who plays the title role...Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice! Well, it's really spelled Betelgeuse, but Beetlejuice is funnier. This has got to be the most inviting role\/performance that Keaton has ever given. He plays Beetlejuice so uninhibited, raw, and vulgar that you can't help but be fascinated by the character. I say that Beetlejuice is the best villain of all of Burton's films, even the Batmans, because Beetlejuice just plain does not care. He is totally self-serving and lets NOTHING stand in his way! Keaton's Beetlejuice probably has more memorable lines in this 1 film than you'll find in any 10 random films combined! And that's incredible given that he is barely on screen. I rank this as one of the all-time comic performances! BEETLEJUICE is just plain enjoyable from start to finish. It's almost like watching a live action cartoon. Amazing how you are drawn into this comic book world so easily and take for granted the afterlife and its rules. The background music adds to the eeriness. And there are some actual scary moments in it, esp. when Beetlejuice enters the picture. The cast chemistry is also indelible Keaton, Davis, Baldwin, Ryder, O'Hara, Jones ALL do excellent work.

At least Donald Sutherland (who never seems to stop making one movie or another for a single day of the year) was given a part he could play straight without having to spout mumbo-jumbo.

The little twist at the ending was just SO cheesy, lifted from three hundred previous horror flicks; I wanted to spit. Another phony bit borrowed from every horror flick ever made was when Denzel is alone in the basement, scary, scary, suddenly there is a thunderous crash and something huge drops on him from above. Oh, never mind, it was just the old rotting ceiling falling in, nothing to worry about after all. Carry on. We do this in scary movies to keep you from getting bored. Eeyew!

He couldn't possibly top his first two movies so, instead, made a less flashy character driven crime flick. Furthermore, he reigned in his style more by basing his film on another source (Elmore Leonard's Rum Punch) as opposed to another of his original screenplays, although admittedly much of the dialogue has been rewritten by Tarantino; the story, however, remains much the same. What emerges is the most mature work in the director's career. It isn't as good as the more personal Dogs or Fiction but it's definitely an excellent crime movie and a great adaption of the book.Elmore Leonard's books are full of snappy dialogue and cool characters. They are prime material for a director like Tarantino, and so it proves here. Samuel Jackson returns from his star-making turn in Pulp Fiction to take on the role of Ordell, the charismatic gun dealer. He is ably supported by Robert De Niro in a very unglamorous role as Ordell's sidekick and Brigitte Fonda as his waster girlfriend. But the movie possibly belongs to the two less famous performers Pam Grier and Robert Forster. Both are sensational, contributing multi-layered performances. Where Forster gives the movie its heart, Grier is its driving force. It could be argued that the film as a whole is Tarantino's tribute to Pam Grier and the blaxploitation film genre. Grier certainly justifies QT's adulation and delivers the goods. It's also a great and unusual thing to see a relationship between a middle-aged man and woman being the core of a film directed by a hip young film-maker, or any film-maker for that matter.As much as I enjoyed Tarantino's work since this movie, Jackie Brown proves that he can make a movie with more substance and character depth. While it may not have the sheer dynamism and fresh invention of his first two movies, it does feel more satisfying that the Kill Bills and Death Proof. I think it would be a good thing for QT to revert back to this style of film-making approach in the future, as the movies about movies approach that he has subsequently adopted can surely only end up at a dead end. Where nowadays he frequently lifts soundtracks from other films, and as a result takes you out of the movie, in his first three films he constructed his soundtracks from 60's and 70's pop songs; and this approach worked much better as this music was not solely associated with other films. Although in the case of Jackie Brown the music is sometimes taken from 70's blaxploitation films, it still doesn't seem quite so obvious. Jackie Brown comes recommended for fans of both Tarantino and crime thrillers in general. Like the book it may not have the greatest plot but its characters are well-drawn and well acted by the excellent cast. A very satisfying movie overall.

Scarface takes a definitive shoot-em-up line, while Carlito's Way is far more character-driven. And it is an excellent film, drawing us into the underworld as a closed system with its own set of rules and a society truly apart from good old-fashioned mainstream American justice, so that we can sympathize with these characters despite their criminality.Some may find the romance scenes distracting. Graphic, certainly, but the addition of Penelope Ann Miller plays Gail extremely well opposite Pacino, and furthermore is a valuable addition to the cast for the way she fits into the theme. As a female character who walks the line between the beacon of moral light that is traditionally a woman in such a story and playing--in a woman's way--with the ambiguities of quick cash versus personal integrity, she helps Carlito to take a step back and think about the global implications of his struggle and his choices.Sean Penn's character was perhaps a bit more difficult for me to swallow while the filmmakers went out of their way to foreshadow potential trouble, they failed to show much to indicate a deeply compromised internal character until almost right before the climax.As for the scene at Grand Central Terminal, what can I say? Cliché, perhaps, but extremely well-executed. The idea of having to catch the train and running up against that narrow wall of time and death when everything in your world is at stake is a nightmare I have dreamt many times over and easily kept me on the edge of the seat. (Incidently, I don't think I've ever made the train\/plane before waking up, but neither can I recall actually missing it.)All-in-all, good for a quick evening alone with some whiskey in a big city besides New York to make you think about going back to New York... almost.

The sixth Jason film, Jason Lives Friday the 13th Par VI of 1986 is probably my personal favorite entry to the series. With this film, the series makes a refreshing twist into the supernatural. In order to continue the series, there obviously was a need for Jason to return after the Jason-less fifth part, and this film presents a Jason who looks creepier than ever.Tommy Jarvis, the boy who killed Jason Voorhees in Part 4, and who was sent to a loony bin in Part 5, returns to Jason's grave to send the mass murderer to hell once and for all. However, he accidentally awakes Jason who had been resting in his grave, and who, after several years, is devoted to returning to the killing-business more then ever...The makeup effects are great here, and the killings are gory and very well-done. The way Jason is resurrected may seem a bit far-fetched and silly - however, the entire series isn't logical, and this therefore doesn't matter at all. The people in this one aren't nearly as annoying as those in most of the other films, which makes this film more suspenseful. The presence of little kids makes the film scarier - after all, it is a lot easier to be scared for small children than for annoying teenagers. Furthermore, the settings of this one are great. All Friday films before Part 8 are set around Crystal Lake, yet the settings look different. This one has the great look of the first film, mainly set deep in the woods at the forest camp by the beautiful Crystal Lake - definitely the nicest killing grounds for good old Jason Voorhees. The film obviously had a pretty high budget, and looks great overall. Even the performances are way above par for the series (though Thom Mathews, who plays the protagonist Tommy Jarvis, isn't very good). This is the film in which it becomes clear that Jason has supernatural powers, and he also looks a lot creepier and more menacing than in any of the predecessors. The mess left by Jason in a blood-soaked room is one of the creepiest sights in any of the films, and Jason Lives has many other great moments. As mentioned above, I am not the biggest fan of the series, but some of the films are highly entertaining, and this one is definitely one of them. Recommended!

It is done with Hitchcock in mind, although merely in technique and in tone, never in the themes or the subject of horror or suspense. Most of the film's core one must thank to Brian De Palma's exploitative and lurid manner of maintaining suspense and revering classic horror architecture stock characters, Gothic camp, and an obtuse, over-the-top view of cruelty and madness into a film that remains a perverse yet instantly accessible and strangely easygoing classic.For me, De Palma has been not only Hitchcock's most faultless copycat, but still in all his elegant pastiche, manages to be a rougher-around-the-edges and more disturbing version of his mentor. ''Carrie'' is based on Stephen King's novel, but his movie version almost seems like a revision, not an adaptation. De Palma's Carrie pays up more visually and technically to any other work in his oeuvre, than to Stephen King psychologically intense and bleak novel. After all it's the same De Palma of always slightly humorous, greedily destructive, still managing again to ludicrously inject in typically pulpy, sensual fashion heaps of veiled erotic undertones, harsh melodrama and wrenching violence. Case in point is the almost soft-porn locker room scene, steam pouring all over the place and a dreamy, kitsch score by Pio Donaggio leading us to the porcelain-skinned figure of our heroine, as she showers in slow motion. Suddenly while soaping her virginal body, she realizes that period blood has poured almost imperceptibly through her thigh. This macabre detail abruptly halts this ethereal introduction and instead introduces us to Carrie's steamless reality and the vile snake pit of tormentors that plague it. The image of those luminous teenagers roaring from laughter and darting Carrie's flaccid, awkward, moist body with tampons is a perfect example of DePalma's exhilarating sensationalism. The shock factor is later replayed for us in magnified close-up when we see the brainless principal of the school subtly notice Carrie's period blood in the shorts of Miss Collins, her onlyprotecting teacher. DePalma is a master.He also wants us to feel tension, not just empathy and sadness for the protagonist, and he builds it like a pressure cooker, dread piling up as we learn about Carrie's eerie supernatural power and the treacherous plans her classmates have for her. We also witness plenty of domestic horror between Carrie and her mother, a psychotic religious wacko who is held responsible for most of Carrie's delayed, repressed sexuality and social immaturity. What's fascinating is that the White household is played tongue-in-cheekly Gothic all dark, candlelit, rusty, creaking wood&#x85;every time Miss White enters the scene, Hermannesque orchestral music plays as if the Count of Dracula had just arrived at his castle while the guests were waiting. When Carrie arrives home at the end, organ pipe at full volume guides the girl through corridors filled with thousands of candles, almost as from the Exorcist. DePalma is a sucker for stylistic excess, culminating in the voodoo-like Christ Carrie is supposed to pray at when Momma locks her up. Even in the flip-side, the lively, colorful high school scenes Carrie will always observe with retirement are played up against a backdrop of cheesy 70's funk.DePalma plays with point of view, lightning (there is even a flash Frankenstein-type lightning striking at an outwards shot of Carrie's house), music and actors in a way that makes Carrie what Psycho was to the 50s, a bag of shock tactics and muddled, yet humane psychology to guide the audience to a point of inevitable, larger-than-life catharsis. The prom scene reminds me of what tragedy was for the ancient Greeks, sporting a conclusion so intense the audience feels a harrowing sort of purge. DePalma's camera pirouettes around the overblown, glitter-ball romanticism of the prom set-up, one-hit wonders from the 70's looming from the speakers, to perfectly capture Carrie's new position, one of enchantment and almost ecstasy yet led by obvious mistrust and terror. It slickly leads up to that infamous slow-motion, silent and almost palpably sick scene of humiliation and violation. All the mayhem that comes after, shot in deep red, is an almost orgiastic example of DePalma's baroque virtuosity.As in post-data, I would like to comment that the only time that curiously, DePalma is subtle is in monitoring the high school scenes. The school Adonis has a blonde afro, the antagonist is blond, dressed in pink, and eye-rolls and swears more than actually talking, and her friend, dressed even to prom with a cap, only grins and giggles throughout the whole picture. Yet nothing else in this respect is one-dimensional, DePalma is a master of technique and he uses nothing more than again angles, actors and dialog to perfectly capture the complicity, familial sense and high exclusiveness of junior high, through silences, looks and hurried conversations. There is no sketch-artist portrayal of the high school jungle; it all remains quietly realistic. It wouldn't hurt to point out that one of the popular girls is fat and has glasses, not your pretty girl prototype, and I'm glad DePalma did create a hairspray-stinking but thoroughly human high school.Yet again Carrie is not a film you will remember for speaking against or preaching a bit on the hell that high school is for some. Or a haunting tale about what religion extremism does on some. You will plainly remember it as the exploit-y story about that girl that got teased cruelly and killed the whole school in response.

It is done with Hitchcock in mind, although merely in technique and in tone, never in the themes or the subject of horror or suspense. Most of the film's core one must thank to Brian De Palma's exploitative and lurid manner of maintaining suspense and revering classic horror architecture stock characters, Gothic camp, and an obtuse, over-the-top view of cruelty and madness into a film that remains a perverse yet instantly accessible and strangely easygoing classic.For me, De Palma has been not only Hitchcock's most faultless copycat, but still in all his elegant pastiche, manages to be a rougher-around-the-edges and more disturbing version of his mentor. ''Carrie'' is based on Stephen King's novel, but his movie version almost seems like a revision, not an adaptation. De Palma's Carrie pays up more visually and technically to any other work in his oeuvre, than to Stephen King psychologically intense and bleak novel. After all it's the same De Palma of always slightly humorous, greedily destructive, still managing again to ludicrously inject in typically pulpy, sensual fashion heaps of veiled erotic undertones, harsh melodrama and wrenching violence. Case in point is the almost soft-porn locker room scene, steam pouring all over the place and a dreamy, kitsch score by Pio Donaggio leading us to the porcelain-skinned figure of our heroine, as she showers in slow motion. Suddenly while soaping her virginal body, she realizes that period blood has poured almost imperceptibly through her thigh. This macabre detail abruptly halts this ethereal introduction and instead introduces us to Carrie's steamless reality and the vile snake pit of tormentors that plague it. The image of those luminous teenagers roaring from laughter and darting Carrie's flaccid, awkward, moist body with tampons is a perfect example of DePalma's exhilarating sensationalism. The shock factor is later replayed for us in magnified close-up when we see the brainless principal of the school subtly notice Carrie's period blood in the shorts of Miss Collins, her onlyprotecting teacher. DePalma is a master.He also wants us to feel tension, not just empathy and sadness for the protagonist, and he builds it like a pressure cooker, dread piling up as we learn about Carrie's eerie supernatural power and the treacherous plans her classmates have for her. We also witness plenty of domestic horror between Carrie and her mother, a psychotic religious wacko who is held responsible for most of Carrie's delayed, repressed sexuality and social immaturity. What's fascinating is that the White household is played tongue-in-cheekly Gothic all dark, candlelit, rusty, creaking wood&#x85;every time Miss White enters the scene, Hermannesque orchestral music plays as if the Count of Dracula had just arrived at his castle while the guests were waiting.
