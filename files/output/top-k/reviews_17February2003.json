When the credits started to roll I had a deep feeling of sorrow in the pit of my stomach. It left an incredible impact on me and I just had to see it again.  I was stunned at the complexity of the characters and the multiple themes one could find in here.  There are emotions in this film that everyone can relate to.  It is not just a film about junkies and how they mess up their lives with drugs.  It is about what drives the people into those drugs. It is about loneliness, and most importantly it is about how everything can become your drug of choice, from candy to television to daydreaming anything in your life that you cannot seem to live without is your drug of choice.More than that it is the way one finds these characters to be at the end.  Many people will point out certain elements that are not true to real life.  They say that the doctor didn't play a doctor correctly, but do you know why? It is because he isn't a doctor.  I've never heard people complain that the gangsters in The Godfather or Goodfellas weren't realistic enough. Some people choose to hate films for two reasons, number one, they don't understand it or number 2 they want to feel special by being different.

After watching it, I went and spoke to those friends. I literally could not find the words to sum up how I was feeling about what I'd just seen. It was everything I  hoped I'd never see all in one movie that seemed to last forever.Things aren't quite the same when you see the slides in health class of people shooting up as when you see how it could play into someone's life. Now, the fact that I have a clear fear of needles, syringes, etc., didn't really help me enjoy this at all. I have to say that I feel very little sympathy for the characters in that they chose to do drugs and took the chance of forming an addiction. I just think it's interesting to see how drugs caused the downward spiral of everyone's lives.The acting in this was outstanding. I'm not a huge Connelly fan, but here she was amazing.

It was really interesting to see that these actors played the parts so well and really showed the way their lives were slipping away. Great job to all actors in this.My impression after the movie was not like I'd had with any other movie. The last half hour of the movie was the worst. I couldn't sit through it. I really took advantage of the good old pause button for that part. I went and talked to my friends who recommended it. I told my friend that I just couldn't find the right words to describe what I thought. He replied by saying, That's exactly the point.

The only reason I picked it up to begin with is because I saw the TV Movie in 1988 with Richard Chamberlain. It was the beginning of my understanding that books and movies, by their very natures, are completely different animals. As for this version of The Bourne Identity...well, I wasn't expecting much (though I was intrigued by certain ivory-tower critics who gave this film a second look when it hit DVD and decided that maybe it wasn't so bad). If I was moderately entertained, I'd have called it a success. But I was suprised.For all its occassional hi-tech trappings, this film reminded me, more than anything, of 1975's Three Days of the Condor with Robert Redford and Max Von Sydow (anyone who liked The Bourne Identity needs to see it immediately if they haven't already). It's geared to entertaining the over-18 crowd as opposed to the usual adolescent thrill-seekers most modern action films pander to. There's gunplay, but nothing so overblown as ten thousand bullets for one shoot-out (the cat-and-mouse game outside the farmhouse comes to mind). There's martial-arts (a lesser-known style called Kali), but no wire-fu for once. And, lest we forget, there's one of the best car-chase sequences in recent memory through Paris (who'd have thunk that a Yugo could make such a good getaway vehicle?).But these are general elements. Specific details that brought back Condor memories are as follows--Matt Damon as Jason Bourne. Like Redford's low-level researcher, he plays a man stuck in a situation that he has no idea how he got into and even less of an idea of who's aiming the bullets at him. But it's not quite one-for-one. Redford didn't have anything to fall back on aside from his experience in the Army and Ma Bell. His ignorance is based on his rank in the CIA hiearchy. Bourne, on the other hand, speaks multiple languages, has formidible fighting skills, and is one of the brightest tacticians I've ever seen on the silver screen. But he has absolutely no clue as to how he is able to do what he does. It's all just instinct and reaction. The frustrating conundrum for him (a fact that is made very clear in the initial sequences when his skills come into play) is that, in spite of these advantages, the unknown past may have already doomed his future.--Franka Potente as Marie Kruetz. Potente's role is more of a bohemian version of Faye Dunaway's character in Condor than anything else. But again, there are key differences. Redford forced Dunaway to cooperate at gunpoint, only coming over to his side with great reluctance. Kruetz is made of sterner stuff, as one would expect from a lifetime on the road. Bourne uses that other great persuader, money, to get what he needs from Kruetz and actually gives her the option of getting out while the getting is still good. Their eventual sleeping together even feels a bit less forced than the similar setup in Condor (a particularly novel touch about the inevitable morning after scene is the fact that Bourne is already up, dressed, and has wiped every surface in the room). The relationship is really the heart of the movie. Without it, most of the story is just not there.--Clive Owen as the Professor. While I'm a trifle disappointed that Owen didn't get more to do with this role (unlike most folks, who discovered his obvious talent in Croupier, I first saw him prove his acting chops in the video clips for the old adventure game, Privateer 2 The Darkening), his smoky, grey presence brings to mind Max Von Sydow's cultured assasin in Condor(even the Professor moniker seems to hint at such a connection). Like Bourne, he's a killing machine, as impersonal and scary as a fully loaded AK-47 to the head (the scene where he pops into pick up his info from Julia Stiles illustrates this beautifully). The only real difference between him and Bourne is the fact that he knows the answers to the questions Bourne has been asking. That he doesn't mind answering them after being bested calls to mind Von Sydow's killing of Redford's quarry and then politely suggesting an extended vacation in Europe when they both walk outside. A baddie who isn't really a baddie...what a concept, huh?Without giving too much away, I thought that the final twist on what put Bourne out in the middle of the Mediterranean to be both logical and even believable, given everything that came before. This would seem to suggest the influence of John Woo (but only in the arena of character development, something particularly stressed in The Killer and the A Better Tomorrow films). It's basic plot logic set up the story in such a way that, when the final suprise twist comes through, it doesn't feel like a deus ex machina so much as a reasonable conclusion.I honestly hope that this film is the start of a trend in the action genre. Just because most action movies are the cinematic equivalent of junk food doesn't mean they have to be. What's wrong with a little fillet mignon?

Funny how you don't hear those same people in Hollywood cheering for `About A Boy' this year, though it finally proves that playboy Hugh Grant is a real star and not just a pretty face with a good agent.  Sadly enough, `About A Boy' is a film that you tell your friend about and despite being a Hugh Grant fanatic, she's oblivious to it's existence.  It can only mean that Hollywood would rather invest in toilet humor and sequels of now rotten films, than back originality thats fit for the entire family.  Possible SpoilersIs it really possible that a few short years ago, the directors of this far superior film were destroying their reputations with the American Pie debacle?

This movie is another in the series of easily predictable cookie cutter `war\/love' films to come out of Hollywood.

First, I thought it was totally lame that they make the girl start it especially if we're supposed to believe that she's a virgin.  Second, she looked as if she were in pain during the whole sex part and if they were really in love, he would act like he cared instead of pounding away.  Third, like the guy walking through wouldn't notice, let's get realistic here. \tI personally think that I may have enjoyed the movie if Tania character were a guy or not in the movie at all.

Broderick is a young pickpocket who has managed to escape from the hellish dungeons of the French city of Aquila (apparently an impossible thing to do.).  Hauer therefore believes that Broderick can help him get into the city so he may kill the Bishop and break the curse.  But McKern knows the real way in which to break the curse and enlists Broderick's help in trying to convince the hard-headed Navarre to listen.

I must make it clear first off that I prefer the original video release version to the Director's Cut.  I was glad that a writer in a film magazine agreed with me that the Director's Cut wasn't that good. I don't care what anyone else says, I stand by my decision!SPOILER WARNINGS!The performances are all very good.  Rutger Hauer is a truly tragic character as Replicant leader Roy Batty.  You really feel for him.  His death scene is truly moving.  Harrison Ford is quite good as Deckard as is Sean Young as the Replicant he falls in love with.  The other Replicants aren't developed much, but I'm sure that Brion James, Daryl Hannah and Joanna Cassidy (WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT) fulfilled all that was required of them.  M. Emmet Walsh and Edward James Olmos are good in their roles as the two main cops, but they too are underdeveloped.  The production design has to be the best aspect of the film as the dystopian LA of the future is brought to life excellently.  The film is also brilliantly underscored by Vangelis.Many people complained about Harrison Ford's voiceover in this picture, but I actually like it as it clears up some plot points and make Deckard's feelings more clear to the audience. And about all that stuff about the Unicorn Dream bit in the DC implying that Deckard may be a Replicant (which Ridley Scott revealed was true a couple of years ago).  Well, it could be true, but it's implied in the original cut as well.  When Sean Young asks Deckard if he ever took one of the 'Voight-Kampff' tests (tests which try to prove if you're a Replicant), he does not answer, because of course he hasn't.  That, for me was an implication.  I admit that I like happy endings, and the happy ending of BLADE RUNNER makes sense.  Because Rachel believed herself to be human, Tyrell did not program her to terminate after four years, and the same could be said about Deckard.  This, in my opinion makes sense and humanises Tyrell to some degree as it shows that he must have had some compassion for the Replicants after all.  Well, you decide for yourselves which version you like the most, but I just wanted to state where I stand.  All in all, though, BLADE RUNNER is a must for sci-fi fans!

Well, it could be true, but it's implied in the original cut as well.

Because Rachel believed herself to be human, Tyrell did not program her to terminate after four years, and the same could be said about Deckard.  This, in my opinion makes sense and humanises Tyrell to some degree as it shows that he must have had some compassion for the Replicants after all.

I must make it clear first off that I prefer the original video release version to the Director's Cut.  I was glad that a writer in a film magazine agreed with me that the Director's Cut wasn't that good. I don't care what anyone else says, I stand by my decision!SPOILER WARNINGS!The performances are all very good.  Rutger Hauer is a truly tragic character as Replicant leader Roy Batty.  You really feel for him.  His death scene is truly moving.  Harrison Ford is quite good as Deckard as is Sean Young as the Replicant he falls in love with.  The other Replicants aren't developed much, but I'm sure that Brion James, Daryl Hannah and Joanna Cassidy (WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT) fulfilled all that was required of them.  M.

Since 1980, we've seen all of this stuff so much that it's beyond passe (the hidden room in the attic, the ghosts of children tossed into boarded-up wells, jewelry from dead people left as clues, the obligatory seance scene).The best thing about The Changeling is the script.  The story unfolds like clockwork, although I got the impression that the director was trying to make it seem like the main characters were in some sort of danger, when really the intention of the ghost was pretty obvious.

This is a wonderful adaptation of his short story, and conveys the atmosphere that exists across his novels.For those of you who don't know who he is, he is the man who coined the term Cyberspace, and is responsible for creating the cyber-punk genre of science fiction novels.  His works are dark and moody, often featuring anti-heroes and megalithic corporations.  His type of writing is an extension of the work of Philip K Dick and followed by Neal Stephenson.To be honest, I don't even understand how someone could not follow this movie.  The plot and premise are clearly spelled out by the actors during the action, the three distinct subplots all terminate together, and the film has a clear denounement.  This isn't some obscure black and white european film that hasn't been properly translated, nor is it some existential film without much dialog, but rather an excellent adaptation of a short story.The only downer is the fact that the CGI is a bit dated - and Ice T is just too over the top.In summary, if you are looking for a true to life original cyberpunk film, this is it.

It was just being showed on HBO and I thought, what the heck! I won't say I regret I saw it, but I can't say I am delighted that I watched it. It wasn't a good movie, it was dumb, but...but...unlike Mistery Men, for example, it made me feel better.SPOILERSThe story is about the craziest people one might see who celebrate some kind of reunion. One of the ex-students though plans revenge on his former mates, who played a terrible prank on him at the end of school. So he goes on a killing spree and some people die, but of course, it's all a comedy, so it's not a big deal... The movie did remind me of Scary Movie though...I don't know why, but I felt it was kind of a parody to scary movies to come. The characters are all very predictable. The one who is least known gets to be the hero, the one who has the best reputation shows his own disgraced side, the good looking chick is kidnapped, etc. It was funny at times and what is most important it did not bore me. Probably will bore others...not me though. I doubt you can think deep on this movie because I doubt it was made for this purpose. It's not worth renting, but if you have a wasted day it might just cheer you up. 4.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"17 February 2003","score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  I had no idea what to expect from this movie.
