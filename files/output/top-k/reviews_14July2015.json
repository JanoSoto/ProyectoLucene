Even the producers and director expected a backslash from the critics. Little did they know that they had just made a milestone almost as significant for the Sci-fi genre than Alien five years before, and that their humility would be rewarded by a close-to-unanimous praise and a lightning propulsion into Pop- Culture. Arnie became THE ultimate action-movie icon, and the rest is no less legendary.And the reason the film works is its remarkable simplicity in each aspect. First of all, the plot  an Artificial Intelligence company named Skynet created such technologically advanced robots that they rebelled against humans and provoked a nuclear holocaust until they were almost defeated by the Rebel Chief John Connor. As a robot sent to kill his mother before he'd exist, Schwarzenegger appears at night, completely naked and takes some civilian clothes before tracking Sarah Connor. But we're in a basic Sci-fi movie and the villain calls for a hero, this is where Michael Biehn intervenes, he looks strong but he's not the alpha male muscular type, what makes easier empathizing with him.His mission is to protect Sarah Connor and kill the Terminator, so running away can only be a temporary option. Yet if anything the villain inspires is not to confront him. The Terminator doesn't know what Sarah Connor looks like, but that's not an issue, any Sarah Connor can potentially be John's mother and is terminated Skynet-style. The murders are straightforward and chilling. At first, the Police don't notice anything odd with that brutal murder, until a second Sarah Connor is gunned down. What kind of serial killer works by the name? Anyway, the most urgent is to protect any Sarah Connor living in L.A., including an adorable waitress, so far from that girl-power archetype from the sequel.And this is one of the film's beauties, the absolute contrast between the robotic killer and the harmless target. And this is where the casting pays off; Arnold Schwarzenegger was certainly criticized for the limitedness of his acting range, especially at a time where his accent was stronger, but here, he's given a role that only an actor like him could have portrayed perfectly a cold and implacable killing machine. The Terminator was nominated #22 villain in the American Film Institute, but he's not sadistic, nor vicious, he's just programed that way, which is why he's so scary. He's like a steamroller of brutality that will ignore every obstacle until it gets him to Sarah Connor.And the film wouldn't have worked had Linda Hamilton looked or played it like Ellen Ripley in Alien, Obviously, a woman like Sarah Connor needs a protection whether from the cops or from Biehn, and some bits of luck that will prevent her from the fatal encounter. Indeed, when the Terminator realizes he didn't kill the right woman although she lived in Sarah's house, begins a breathtaking, spellbinding cat-and-mouse chase. There are shootouts, there are car chases, but they felt different because this time, the enemy doesn't try to get at them but to kill them, they're means as well as ends. The Terminator is an unstoppable death warrant, guided by fatality. Notice the scene when, for once, Sarah gets the illusion of being finally protected, in a commissariat. The Terminator's I'll be back, especially when heard for the first time, sums up everything, no matter how far away you try to push him, he'll get back to you.And this, resonates as the voice of fatality, the omen of an inevitable confrontation, something that neither Biehn, nor Sarah can't avoid, the future has come to haunt them, and if Sarah is really the mother of a future fighter, even she will have to express that 'fighting' part of herself. Whether you look at the half-empty or half-full glass, you'll see Terminator as a predestination or fatality movie. And I guess this is why the appellation neo-noir isn't gratuitous. Noir is about people who try to escape from a painful certainty but can't only triumph over it by confronting it, at the cost of something precious such as their innocence, their optimism, their faith on life or humanity.And 'The Terminator is mostly set at night, it features characters who hide from these robots that remind them the apocalyptic future they carry on their hands, their own responsibility. Of course, bonds ought to be made and we have some clues that the predestination thing will provide some curious loops that don't quite respect the orthodoxy of time travels. But the film isn't about time travels, it's about a sense of duty and responsibility. And in a way The Terminator, as a villain, is an inspiration for the heroes, as much as he must kill them no mater what, they have to resist and to defeat him at any costs, the measure of a great antagonist is the degree to which he allows the heroes to overcome their weaknesses.As a matter of fact, the whole trilogy invites humans to question their condition, from being masters to slaves of the technology, what you can control can control you, it's all up to us to take the control of our lives back.

","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"14 July 2015","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Alfred Hitchcock's illustrious career truly began to take off in the 1950's, as most of his remembered films come from those years. One of these such films is the classic Rear Window, released in 1954 and based on a short story written by Cornell Woolrich. The film was regarded as one of Hitchcock's best, being included in every Masterpiece or Essentials collection of his, and it currently has a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, an 8.6 on IMDb and is in three of the Top AFI lists. So, let's see if one of Hitchcock's most known is as good as they say.Rear Window follows a photographer forced to stay in his home due to his leg injury. He bides his time by watching his neighbors out of the window, dealing with his girlfriend, and having discussions with his insurance nurse. One night, he witnesses events through his window that begin to make him believe that the man just across the square may have murdered someone. As he gets closer and closer to the truth, things only get crazier and crazier.This film was one that I expected to be great, due to it's history, but I didn't expect it to be this great, honestly. Stewart, as he always does, does a brilliant job as Jeff, a photographer who gains a greater appreciation for the people in his life as the film goes on, and he really sells the role. Grace Kelly also does a stellar job as Jeff's girlfriend, Lisa Fremont, managing to never seem like she's trying to nag Jeff as they disagree about their future together. Thelma Ritter is an often darkly funny character as Stella, and she truly brings a dimension to this film that really helps it, in my opinion. Raymond Burr does a intriguing job as the neighbor Jeff begins to suspect as the murderer. Finally, Wendell Corey is an intriguing character, as the detective friend Jeff calls in to consult with.The music for the film, only really for the opening and closing, done by Franz Waxman was great. I wish it had been utilized more, but I get that if it had, it might have ruined what Hitchcock was trying to accomplish. The special effects used at times, especially in a certain scene at the end, were not that bad. I mean, today, they wouldn't fly, but for the time, it looks pretty good. I enjoyed the lighting in this film, such as the many scenes where Jeff is sitting in the dark in his apartment, and it looks as if he's hiding in the shadows at times. I mean, sometimes, it's intentional, but at other times it works well.I thought the script was written very well. Several of the discussions between Jeff and some of the other characters were very riveting and hold your interest, even if it seems to be about something trivial on the surface. I enjoyed a lot of the camera motions and how the film was done. The film is basically set in Jeff's apartment for the entire film, as most of the camera shots of other people and apartments are from his apartment, which I thought added a lot to the film. We only see what the characters can see - nothing more, nothing less.I also really enjoyed how the sound effects really complimented the film. Instead of having a formal type of score, you mainly only hear sound effects from other apartments or natural nature noises. The only time you actually hear music, aside from what Franz Waxman did for the opening\/ending, is from the songwriter's apartment. I thought that was a very clever way to keep the film grounded, props to Hitchcock for that idea.Overall, Rear Window is an achievement in filmmaking. Its mystery is compelling, the story is great, the acting is fantastic, the music, albeit limited, works very well, as does it's use of sound effects, the script and the way the film was done. If you haven't seen it, consider checking it out as it is very riveting and will keep you guessing until the end.10\/10.

I know it let lots of people, myself included, down. Until the last half hour, it was an eight star movie. Fishburne and Neil are great actors and do a good job in the movie. When you have two great supporting actors like Isaacs and Noseworthy, you have an excellent cast. The creepy dreamlike presaging dream, Anderson using sudden knock your fillings loose pop out scares, one is just a locker door opening. He knows how to scare you; that creepy tape, the gut covered interiors all this is excellent work. The sets have a Gothic like look to them even the interiors show a great attention to detail. The space effects are excellent; Neptune and its space look quite realistic and well done. The movie was working so well. The creepy lighting and noise effects that will make your skin crawl. What this could have been? If only after Weir gouges out his eyes and he turns into Pinhead The Neptune Years, the whole movie flips and we are in a sequel to hellraiser. A very bad sequel, I might add. The problem is one of my favorite pet peeves with movies. Please, could we pick a genre? Is it going to be science fiction or horror. The first 75% of the movie is pure science fiction with horror elements, after the eye gouge we turn into total horror.The movie descends into Weir as a stand in for Pinhead making everyone see worms crawling on dead people, oh how scary. There are also cringe worthy moments; how about Claire bathing with her panties on for some reason? If you cannot get her to strip, please do not show her in the bathtub with her old lady panties on, it looks so silly. Let's not even get started on darkness boy being in the absolute zero environment of Neptune for that long. He would have been frozen like a glacier; you would have needed a blowtorch to thaw him out. Other questions will plague your mind Why would an intelligence that could manipulate matter like that doors, hatches, switches have allowed those explosives to 1. even be there, or 2. Still be a threat to it? Why wouldn't it do what HAL did in the book of 2001 open all the airlocks and decompress the whole place instantly? The intelligence of this ship fluctuates unbelievably, one moment smashing in doors, manipulating switches and hatches but allows the charges to be there all that time?All these failures could be forgiven; I still say it is worth watching for the breathtaking effects and 2\/3's of a very good movie. No movie is perfect, this is a very well done movie until Weir gouges out his eyes and turns into the voice of the ship. The movie shows him sucked out into space clearly where he would have been a block of ice in ten seconds, later he reappears unharmed eyes still gouged out. It is not just the change of genre; the writing goes out the window with the descent into pure horror. I can only advise you to do what I do; watch the movie until Weir takes care of his near sightedness permanently and turn the movie off. On the whole, mediocre but worth watching once or twice; I would not buy this movie. I had it once but threw it away.

The creepy dreamlike presaging dream, Anderson using sudden knock your fillings loose pop out scares, one is just a locker door opening. He knows how to scare you; that creepy tape, the gut covered interiors all this is excellent work. The sets have a Gothic like look to them even the interiors show a great attention to detail. The space effects are excellent; Neptune and its space look quite realistic and well done. The movie was working so well. The creepy lighting and noise effects that will make your skin crawl. What this could have been? If only after Weir gouges out his eyes and he turns into Pinhead The Neptune Years, the whole movie flips and we are in a sequel to hellraiser. A very bad sequel, I might add. The problem is one of my favorite pet peeves with movies. Please, could we pick a genre? Is it going to be science fiction or horror. The first 75% of the movie is pure science fiction with horror elements, after the eye gouge we turn into total horror.The movie descends into Weir as a stand in for Pinhead making everyone see worms crawling on dead people, oh how scary. There are also cringe worthy moments; how about Claire bathing with her panties on for some reason? If you cannot get her to strip, please do not show her in the bathtub with her old lady panties on, it looks so silly. Let's not even get started on darkness boy being in the absolute zero environment of Neptune for that long. He would have been frozen like a glacier; you would have needed a blowtorch to thaw him out. Other questions will plague your mind Why would an intelligence that could manipulate matter like that doors, hatches, switches have allowed those explosives to 1. even be there, or 2. Still be a threat to it? Why wouldn't it do what HAL did in the book of 2001 open all the airlocks and decompress the whole place instantly? The intelligence of this ship fluctuates unbelievably, one moment smashing in doors, manipulating switches and hatches but allows the charges to be there all that time?All these failures could be forgiven; I still say it is worth watching for the breathtaking effects and 2\/3's of a very good movie. No movie is perfect, this is a very well done movie until Weir gouges out his eyes and turns into the voice of the ship. The movie shows him sucked out into space clearly where he would have been a block of ice in ten seconds, later he reappears unharmed eyes still gouged out. It is not just the change of genre; the writing goes out the window with the descent into pure horror. I can only advise you to do what I do; watch the movie until Weir takes care of his near sightedness permanently and turn the movie off. On the whole, mediocre but worth watching once or twice; I would not buy this movie. I had it once but threw it away.

It's crazy enough to have a man facing pregnancy but out of all the actors who could pull it with more or less believability, hiring the ultimate tough guy, the one with the most masculine height and bone structure was quite a risky move. Risky but not absurd, there are times when you're entitled to a certain level of absurdity when making a comedy movie, but you can tell that Junior ambition reached higher than simple laughs, it wanted to tell a heart-warming story, a comedy with a heart, as I like to say.This is why the casting was a masterstroke. This isn't Twins where Schwarzenegger's perfection was the illustration of a successful genetic manipulation and De Vito, all the opposite, here, Arnie's casting isn't crucial to the part, neither is Danny De Vito, but at the end, you realize that the movie couldn't have worked with better actors. De Vito has this 'streetwise businessman with sharp teeth' thing justifying such a gutsy idea, and Arnie is the cold European scientist so dedicated to his profession that we believe he can be lured into that crazy project.Yet the film could have sinned by cynicism, showing that there's a mad scientist or sorcerer apprentice hiding behind every doctor, and that laboratories would trade ethics for the financial success of a revolutionary medicine, in the film's case, one to increase women's fertility and estrogen production. But they're not allowed to test the medicine on women. Never mind, the bounds of science are unlimited.

But that it took almost two decades for penicillin to really get its worldwide attention because Fleming was a good researcher but not much of a marketer and couldn't even get the implications his discovery would make.So, in a way, there's a little mad scientist here, a businessmen there, but it's always for people's own good, and this is where Junior really takes you, it's not a movie about lobbying or genetic manipulation. It's the story of a man who discovers his maternal side by the simple process of feeling a baby inside him, and Arnold Schwarzenegger makes it not only believable but also touching, he doesn't overplay, within his own (not so limited) range, he finds the perfect note to draw a touched smile in your face, and there's one wonderful moment where he De Vito's character touch the belly and smiles, so moving you forget the implausibility of the situation.But there can't be a film about pregnancy without women, and both Pamela Reed and Emma Thompson plays respectively De Vito's ex-wife and the scientist who took Arnie's laboratory.

Howard the Duck is just the ugly duckling that didn't turn into a swan! Directed by Willard Huyck, and based off, a marvel comic of the same name, by Steve Gerber. The movie tells the story of Howard the Duck (Voiced by Chip Zien), a sarcastic anthropomorphic alien duck that was accidentally brought down to our world, by scientist, Dr. Jennings (Jeffrey Jones). When, Jennings attempts to return Howard to his world with his humans' deep-probing observatory laser-scope; instead of transferring Howard, an evil alien spirit was transfer into his own body. Now the wisecracking Howard, must fight this evil essence, while also finding a way to fit in with our society. Can Howard stop this alien invader or will the Earth be doom? Watch the movie to find out, if you really want to. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found it, a bit odd, that Marvel Entertainment Group (MEG), sold millions of options to studios to produce films based on Marvel Comics characters. Yet, this movie was the first Marvel Comic to ever be adaptation for the big screen. Wow! Just Wow! Although there had been several TV adaptations of Marvel characters during the preceding 21 years, this was the first attempt at a theatrical release since the Captain America serial of 1944. I'm deeply surprised, by that. Honestly, I would have, thought, Howard the Duck would be last comic book to be adapted! Anyways, the movie was supposed to be an animated feature originally, but at the last second, changed to live action, because Universal needed a film for a summer release, and couldn't wait for long term, animation to be made. Lucas suggested that the film could be produced in live action, with special effects created by Industrial Light & Magic. While the special effects were pretty good at the time, they became very dated, with each, passing year. It shows that the special effects weren't as sophisticated as George Lucas, has thought. The animatronics for Howard the Duck by far is the best and still pretty believable today. It allow for a very good range of motion and realism. During production, a stronger emphasis was placed on special effects, rather than the story. Due to this, the story kinda lost focus and became directionless. The whole tone of the film is very differ compare to the comics. The film was market for kids, while it's clear, the comic books were made, for adults, due to its risky film noir satire elements. While, the harsh complex nature of Howard were somewhat clean up, it's still hard to figure out, if this film, was intended for adults or children! I was deeply confused by the sexual elements of the film. Why could they feature a notorious scene where a human character, Beverly (Lea Thompson) tries to seduce Howard!? Was Bestiality, alright to show in a 1980s kid's film?! By far, the most distracting and tasteless scene was the glimpse of duck tits. Why would they do this!? It's already, disturbing enough, showing Howard, working at some type of hot spa sex club! Come on! Are the writers, perverts? Younger kids might also might be disturbed by the villain's monster mutations. The movie gets noticeably darker once the Dark Overlord possesses Dr. Jenning. The absurdism levels are really high in this film. The film gets worst by having some of most obnoxious silly side characters ever. Jeffrey Jones as the Dark Overlord was laughable. He looks like an outcast demon from the 1984's Ghostbusters, mixed with MegaMan's Dr. Wily. It gets funnier, throughout the film when he sounds like G.I Cobra Commander, drinking Helium. Tim Robbins is really wasted, here as scientist, Phil Blumburtt. While, he is great actor, his character is very annoying. As much, as I love Lea Thompson, as an actress. I really didn't like Beverly, the rock-star, as well. Not only does, Beverly not appear to be smart. She seem so one-dimension cartoony with her 1980s hair rock-star gimmick. Everything about this film is dated. The classic styles, fashions, hairstyles, and trends of the 1980s are shown in all their laughable glory here. The music by John Barry is pretty catchy. It's by far, one of the better things about this film. The humor, not so much. Most of the humor kinda miss the funny bone, for me. I thought, the merciless ducks puns could had been better. Howard the Duck's 5 second appearance at the end of 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy was better than this entire movie! While, Howard the Duck laid a rotten egg at the box office and ended up earning several Razzies, including Worst Film. It's deserve its reputation as one of the worst films, ever. Overall It's just one big empty bird-dropping.

While, the harsh complex nature of Howard were somewhat clean up, it's still hard to figure out, if this film, was intended for adults or children! I was deeply confused by the sexual elements of the film. Why could they feature a notorious scene where a human character, Beverly (Lea Thompson) tries to seduce Howard!? Was Bestiality, alright to show in a 1980s kid's film?! By far, the most distracting and tasteless scene was the glimpse of duck tits. Why would they do this!? It's already, disturbing enough, showing Howard, working at some type of hot spa sex club! Come on! Are the writers, perverts? Younger kids might also might be disturbed by the villain's monster mutations. The movie gets noticeably darker once the Dark Overlord possesses Dr. Jenning. The absurdism levels are really high in this film. The film gets worst by having some of most obnoxious silly side characters ever. Jeffrey Jones as the Dark Overlord was laughable. He looks like an outcast demon from the 1984's Ghostbusters, mixed with MegaMan's Dr. Wily. It gets funnier, throughout the film when he sounds like G.I Cobra Commander, drinking Helium. Tim Robbins is really wasted, here as scientist, Phil Blumburtt. While, he is great actor, his character is very annoying. As much, as I love Lea Thompson, as an actress. I really didn't like Beverly, the rock-star, as well. Not only does, Beverly not appear to be smart. She seem so one-dimension cartoony with her 1980s hair rock-star gimmick. Everything about this film is dated. The classic styles, fashions, hairstyles, and trends of the 1980s are shown in all their laughable glory here. The music by John Barry is pretty catchy. It's by far, one of the better things about this film. The humor, not so much. Most of the humor kinda miss the funny bone, for me. I thought, the merciless ducks puns could had been better. Howard the Duck's 5 second appearance at the end of 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy was better than this entire movie! While, Howard the Duck laid a rotten egg at the box office and ended up earning several Razzies, including Worst Film. It's deserve its reputation as one of the worst films, ever.

Howard the Duck is just the ugly duckling that didn't turn into a swan! Directed by Willard Huyck, and based off, a marvel comic of the same name, by Steve Gerber. The movie tells the story of Howard the Duck (Voiced by Chip Zien), a sarcastic anthropomorphic alien duck that was accidentally brought down to our world, by scientist, Dr. Jennings (Jeffrey Jones). When, Jennings attempts to return Howard to his world with his humans' deep-probing observatory laser-scope; instead of transferring Howard, an evil alien spirit was transfer into his own body. Now the wisecracking Howard, must fight this evil essence, while also finding a way to fit in with our society. Can Howard stop this alien invader or will the Earth be doom? Watch the movie to find out, if you really want to. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found it, a bit odd, that Marvel Entertainment Group (MEG), sold millions of options to studios to produce films based on Marvel Comics characters. Yet, this movie was the first Marvel Comic to ever be adaptation for the big screen. Wow! Just Wow! Although there had been several TV adaptations of Marvel characters during the preceding 21 years, this was the first attempt at a theatrical release since the Captain America serial of 1944. I'm deeply surprised, by that. Honestly, I would have, thought, Howard the Duck would be last comic book to be adapted! Anyways, the movie was supposed to be an animated feature originally, but at the last second, changed to live action, because Universal needed a film for a summer release, and couldn't wait for long term, animation to be made. Lucas suggested that the film could be produced in live action, with special effects created by Industrial Light & Magic. While the special effects were pretty good at the time, they became very dated, with each, passing year. It shows that the special effects weren't as sophisticated as George Lucas, has thought. The animatronics for Howard the Duck by far is the best and still pretty believable today. It allow for a very good range of motion and realism. During production, a stronger emphasis was placed on special effects, rather than the story. Due to this, the story kinda lost focus and became directionless.

Wow, while it still stirs up some of my nostalgic emotions it also stirs up a lot of disgust.First, the racism. I always thought, as a kid, that the Long Duk Dong character seemed like an offensive caricature but as an adult I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt. I don't believe the character himself is offensive, it's more the way the character is presented. For example, a gong rings almost every time the character's name is said out loud. And the music that plays when his character is on screen is also stereotypical. As for the character himself, he seems like a nerd but is actually the life of the party, which isn't very stereotypical at all. Still, it's a shame they had to stoop to cheap sound racist sound effect jokes.Next, the gender issues. Ted the nerd sexually harasses Molly Ringwald throughout the entire movie, we're meant to think this is funny but really it's just kind of infuriating. Next, her romantic interest Jake says he could violate his drunk, passed out, girlfriend 100 different ways if he wanted to. Ted says something along the lines of what are you waiting for?. WOAH, is Ted, this character that we're supposed to laugh along and sympathize with really condoning that Jake rape his passed out girlfriend? To make things worse, Jake offers his passed out girlfriend to Ted if Ted will help him pursue Molly Ringwald. So now Jake and Ted are using the rape of another character as a means of bargaining.

DON'T WATCH THE American DUBBED VERSION - it's stupid and weak. Please watch the original Australian version because the dialogue is great and quotable... Sorry for screaming this, but I mean it. e.g. Aussie version you'd better send a meat truck. Tommy's copped a saucepan in the throat. (tough, rough and real Aussie voice)American version boring blah blah blah...send an ambulance. (fake John Wayne voice)Anyway, I remember as a young child in 1980 being woken up by a cacophony of loud engine sounds, screeching tyres and a booming brass instrument sound track screaming through the floor from the downstairs living room. The next day I asked my parents about the noise. My Dad started going on about this policeman guy who had his hands full and my Mum shaking her head saying the baddies were really horrible. But they wouldn't let me see it...Jump ahead 9 years I was in the local video store and saw this title with a man wearing a weird helmet pistol pointing a double barrelled shot gun at me... I remembered the Betamax video in the living room many years before. I rented this VHS out, which was naughty because it was an 18 cert movie. Oh my goodness me! The first 10 minutes was amazing! I was hooked. The movie is a rough, tough action movie with dozens of memorable moments I still enjoy thinking about. The bad guys were\/are so scary. They are absolutely mad - in an unnervingly realistic way. That bit when one of them burns his own arm with a cigarette lighter, only to blow it out again because it hurt... LOL - nuts, man. Totally nuts. After watching the movie, I immediately went round knocking on my friend's doors telling them to come round to mine and watch it. They were enthralled too. This led to many, many dangerous push bike chases and crashes LOL! Even today, I still sometimes just throw on the first 10 minutes and the Goose ride, on full volume, just for a little adrenaline buzz 8oD. In my opinion, this is by far Mel Gibson's best role - though I liked him in Brave Heart, even though that was a bit cheesy. He is excellent as Max and steals the screen whenever he appears. A real star in the making. The camera work is really exciting too, with the camera close to the tarmac on the fastest Kawasaki bikes on Earth at the time... That alone is work of art. The stunts are amazing. There is one bit where one of the bikers actually had a crashing bike smack him on the head - BANG! One thing that really stands out in my mind, apart from The Goose, Max and the first chase, is the creepiness of the bad guys. They are totally convincing as a gang of nutters. Really scary. They actually do my head in, even to this day. Toecutter certainly is the boss of that almost uncontrollable group and is a fantastic baddie. The movie is worth watching simply for the baddies, let alone anything else. ...Oh yeah, the naked guy running away across the fields with a bleeding bottom was a surprise... On a deeper note, there is something really eerily disturbing about the whole theme and the very human reactions and involvement of all the cast. At first glance, some of the moments might seem a bit wooden, especially from the extras, but real people who aren't thespians in real life situations often are. The sense of societal breakdown, the desperation, the anxiety are quite disturbing. The psychological aspects of the main characters, both good and bad is really compelling and worth a well worded essay in itself.

Jarrell learns of a case where a missing Tibetan child known as The Golden Child has been kidnapped and is asked to assist in rescuing the child. The Golden Child is no ordinary child and is the sole person responsible for ensuring peace will remain on Earth, but evil sorcerers lead by Sardo Numspa (Charles Dance) intend to use the child for their own evil purposes and in order to appease their evil god.I'm prepared to commend this film because despite some of its weaknesses it is a fairly original story and for that reason it is very easy to get involved with the film. This film of course has Eddie Murphy in it from a time back in the 1980's when he was very much still in his prime. Part of the reason that this film works is Murphy himself - he brings his usual energy to the table and the fact that he also plays a good guy who's fairly likable also helped to keep me invested in the film.This film is also pretty funny - I liked it at the start where Murphy is trying to make an appeal about his search for a lost kid and the talk show host is talking over him and tries to change the subject or discuss more trivial matters. It's funny because it's believable and I assume it meant to act as some sort of satire on arrogant and self-absorbed talk show hosts. What the writers were trying to say here didn't really matter to me (the fact that I found it funny was more important). The humour here was also surprisingly clean for a Murphy vehicle and it's even more surprising given the dark plot that the writers serve up here. All these aspects work well to create an entertaining and original film but....I've applauded the film for having a fairly original story, but sadly the development of the story is quite poor and is never really fleshed out enough to make this aspect work. There was also a random section where it's as though Murphy and the evil sorcerers are on a film set with a live audience which I never really understood. It kind of goes from interesting & refreshing to bizarre and strange - the final sequence is ridiculous and mildly embarrassing. I also felt that because the bizarre story dominated so much of the second half of the film that it almost undid all the humour and intrigue that had been built up in the first half.This film is far from perfect, but Murphy's energy, the original story, and the reasonable number of laughs that you get here do make it watchable. Dance isn't given much to do, but he is effective in his scenes and actually makes a good villain (albeit his character is a little thin). Lewis is more than a pretty face and actually holds her own well here and the chemistry between her and Murphy isn't bad.This film has an IMDb rating of 5.8 and I think that the IMDb community have got it about right; it's not great enough to stack up against some of Murphy's better vehicles, but it isn't bad enough to render it unwatchable.

Originally, Madeline was supposed to be played by Vera Miles, but she had to back out due to her pregnancy, and Hitchcock then went with Kim Novak. It took three months to film, and the music was done once again by Bernard Hermann, composer of a lot of Hitchcock's work (including Psycho). When it was first released, it received mixed reception, with people disappointed that Hitchcock departed from his usual romantic-thriller, and had veered off into mystery. So, with all of this in mind, and this film being a personal favorite of my friend, a Hitchcock aficionado, let's dive right into a film that changed Hitchcock's career forever! Vertigo follows an former detective with a fear of heights who is enlisted by an old college friend to follow his wife, because the man fears his wife may be suicidal. As the detective gets further and further into the dark mystery, he soon finds that he may be in love with the woman.I didn't know what to expect from this movie, honestly. Like I said, my one friend is a very big fan of the movie, and that's what propelled me to watch it as one of the first Hitchcock films as part of my marathon. James Stewart and Kim Novak do stellar jobs as the two leads, bringing themselves as well as the audience into a whirlwind romance that is rather remarkable the more you think about it. Stewart, in particular, really sells the character that I believe Hitchcock was going for. Barbara Bel Geddes does a lovely job as Midge, and really sells the character of a girl just trying to help Scottie through what is happening. Tom Helmore does a great job in his somewhat limited role as Madeleine's husband, really selling the role he's supposed to play.The effects used in the movie, particularly the ones used to convey Scottie's fear of heights are quite remarkable given the time in which they were done. It truly feels like you can feel his fear and what he's going through, The music, done by longtime Hitchcock collabrator Bernard Herrmann, is quite impressive. Especially the music in the opening, it gets you curious and grabs your attention immediately so you begin asking what's going on.The set pieces, making great use of many locations around San Francisco, are fantastic. Special greetings are given to the church used in the middle-end of the film, which had a tower that was digitally superimposed upon the church, harking back to the effects comments I made. Another set I liked are both Midge and Scottie's apartments, the contrasts between Midge's bright colors and Scottie's more subdued ones are quite subtly done.Perhaps my one complaint with the film, and it's probably just trivial, but the scene where Scottie has a nightmare and it's all cartoonish and stuff, it seemed really fake and forced. I mean, it's still a cool sequence, but I feel like it didn't mesh well enough with the rest of the film.Overall, Vertigo is a superb film. It's acting, effects, music, set pieces, and script are all fantastic. While I have some issues with Scottie's nightmare sequence, the rest of the film is a cut above the rest and if you enjoy a good unconventional mystery, then you'll get a kick out of this film.10\/10.

No matter how many times I watch this movie I am still mesmerized by Rod Lurie's spellbinding script and brilliant directing. Lurie brought out the best in his cast, Joan Allen was great but it was Gary Oldman's depiction of the complex and enigmatic Shelly Runyon that was truly masterly. Even classics like All the President's Men are eclipsed by this movie. When making comparison's I suppose one must also consider Otto Preminger's 1962 effort Advise and Consent, a movie not even discussed in The Contender's bonus materials. Despite a remarkable cast and a heralded director, Advise & Consent, alas, deserves the relative obscurity it enjoys today, (it bombed in 1962) I had trouble staying awake through the turgid performance of an ailing Charles Laughton. Political dramas are not easy to pull off, cinema audiences are much more savvy and sophisticated today. Mr Smith Goes to Washington seems so naive it's hard to believe even 1939 audiences bought it. As far as The Contender's realism is concerned, wouldn't it be great to hear the opinions of Washington insiders like Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin and Condoleezza Rice? assuming they took time out to watch this movie. One thing I just can't get my head around is why such a brilliant filmmaker as Rod Lurie would waste his talent on a remake of Straw Dogs. Unbelievable!

Easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen, I'm absolutely stunned at the rave reviews and high rating it has on this wonderful site. Usually the reviewers get it mostly right, but here is a good example of how nothing is perfect. I don't know where to start criticizing this piece of trash. With a cast that includes some of my favorites I was expecting an interesting experience and was punished with a nightmare mess of a movie. I felt so sorry for James Mason as I couldn't figure out what accent he was trying. Maximillian Schell is awesome, but here I actually laughed out loud twice which could not have been the intention of the writer or director. I could only understand about 20% of what David Warner was saying and James Coburn was supposed to be the star I guess and had about 12 sentences of dialogue. He also had a totally unintelligible scene with some woman, maybe a nurse? I had to really stretch to find a reason to give it a 2 instead of a 1. A couple decent lines and battle sequences is about it here. I kept waiting for it to get better, but amazingly enough it got worse towards the end! If you have to see every movie ever made, then go for it. Otherwise, there has to be a better choice out there somewhere.

If I may even go as far as saying, and being bold, better than the first one. So, to my delight then, I was very much looking forward to Alien 3. However, this was a different director than the first two, which both had different directors as well. So, I thought maybe this will still be a great movie. I was wrong. I literally got less than halfway through the movie and I turned it off. It had no storyline, no characters you care about (with the exception of Sigourney Weaver), and really nothing interesting going on. So, you've been warned. Watch the first two, skip this one.

But after that, many people write all of his other movies off because they've heard they're terrible. And most of them are. But this one is extremely underrated. It may not be Shakespeare, but it's quality entertainment nonetheless. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson are fantastic in their roles and they carry the story very well. It's a little slow in parts, but for the most part it is extremely entertaining and keeps you engaged the whole way through. The ending (though I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't seen it) gives me chills every time I see it. It is an inventive concept with twists and turns throughout. So if you think that Shamylan didn't do anything good after the sixth sense, if you're judging his talent by the village and lady in the water, give this movie a try. It's a great psychological thriller that assures us that Shamylan was not a one-hit wonder. Although I wouldn't argue with you if you said these two were the only ones worth watching.
