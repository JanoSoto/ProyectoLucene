[{"date":"22 August 2014","score":"","review":" Bryan Singer has given life to Stan Lee's X-men in the best possible way.It was entertaining and also interesting in all aspects.The Wolverine is much more than what he appears in the comics.Well done Hugh Jackman.The casting was splendid.Stewart and Mckellen were truly getting us to think what are they really Friends or enemies.There are two group of mutants who are fighting for the same cause.The difference is their approach.The movie gives fair share of incomplete puzzles which may be answered through the sequels.The screenplay was good and the story was OK.I would say its a good start to a great series.I'm eager to watch the upcoming sequels.
