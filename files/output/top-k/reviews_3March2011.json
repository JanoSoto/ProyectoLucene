In a moment of sudden bravery, he captures the Mexican command. He is promoted to Captain for his heroism, but his commanding officer realizes he is a coward and transfers him to the remote Fort Spencer in the Sierra Nevada mountain range.After Boyd joins the seven other inhabitants of Fort Spencer, a stranger named Colqhoun arrives and describes his wagon train becoming lost in the Sierra Nevadas and being reduced to cannibalism to avoid starvation.

He had killed his five companions and sets about killing the soldiers from Fort Spencer one by one, including the commanding officer, Colonel Hart.Boyd manages to escape the massacre by jumping off a cliff, breaking his leg in the process. He hides in a pit along with the body of a fellow soldier and eventually he eats some of the man's flesh to stay alive. When he finally limps back into the fort he is delirious and severely traumatized; none of the remaining soldiers (who did not meet Colqhoun) believe his wild tale, and a second expedition finds no bodies or any trace of the man. A temporary commander is assigned to the fort and to Boyd's horror it turns out to be Colqhoun, now cleaned up and calling himself Colonel Ives. The others still refuse to believe that Ives is the killer, especially after he bears no sign of the wounds inflicted on him during the massacre.Ives tells Boyd that he used to suffer from tuberculosis, but when a Native scout told him the Wendigo myth he just had to try, murdering him, eating his flesh and in the process curing his maladies. Having murdered the expedition he led he now plans to use the fort as a base to do the same to other passing travelers; he compares the location of the fort, with the guaranteed supply of isolated migrants that it entails, to the notion of Manifest Destiny that draws them there.Boyd is suspected of murder after another soldier mysteriously dies and is chained up; he watches helplessly while the last officer is murdered by an unexpected ally of Ives Colonel Hart, back from the dead after the massacre.Ives saved Hart by feeding him his own comrades, and now Hart is addicted, like Colqhoun, to human meat. Ives wounds Boyd and forces him to make a choice eat or die. Eventually Boyd gives in and eats a stew made out of the last officer killed, and his wound heals. But rather than join the two men in their conspiracy to convert General Slauson (who assigned Boyd to Fort Spencer in the first place), he convinces Hart to free him so he can kill Ives. Hart does so, but asks Boyd to kill him first as he no longer wants to live as a cannibal. A battle between Boyd and Ives takes place at the climax, with both men wounding each other badly, yet they won't die easily due to their new powers. Finally, Boyd forces Ives onto a large bear trap and springs it, pinning them both together. Ives taunts Boyd by telling him he'll eat him as soon as he dies, but Ives expires first. Boyd refuses to save himself by eating Ives' body and dies on top of his adversary.Martha, George's sister, stumbles upon the bodies of both Ives and Boyd, closes the door, and walks away. In the last scene, General Slauson arrives. While his aide looks around, the general is seen tasting the stew that was left on the fire, suggesting that he might unwittingly be carrying forward the Wendigo curse.Bottom line if you are looking for a cannibal film, look no further.

Basically it picks up where the first film left off, where Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) was put in prison for attempting to destroy Metropolis, and we see reminders of what happened to Krypton and three criminals from the planet where the hero came from. Three human criminals have taken over the Eiffel Tower in Paris, and after saving the life of Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) and exploding the hydrogen bomb in space, Superman aka Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve) unintentionally releases the three alien criminals from their imprisonment. These three alien invaders, leader General Zod (Terence Stamp), Ursa (Sarah Douglas) and Non (Jack O'Halloran) have the same powers as the Man of Steel, and slowly start learning about life on Earth before making any plans for take over. Meanwhile, Lois is in love with Superman, and vice versa, but of course as Clark he does his best to make sure she won't find out his true identity, but of course she starts suspecting and eventually does find out. Now knowing Clark is Superman, he makes the humongous decision, advised by his dead biological mother Lara (Susannah York, who tragically died a month or two before I saw this), to relinquish himself of all his powers to be with his true love. After spending the night with her, and getting into a fight where his human blood is exposed, Clark is not quite used to the life of a human being, but worse is to come. General Zod and his two minions have mastered their powers now and have started taking over place after place with destruction, and after escaping from prison, Lex Luthor may be trying to help them take over. They have found out that Superman is the son of their enemy from Krypton, Jor-El, and they are demanding him to show his face or see all humans on Earth destroyed. Initially it looks like Clark cannot gain his powers back, but he returns to the crystal fortress in the North Pole, but he finds the green crystal to get them back and go against the alien invaders. After being defeated in an earlier battle, Superman chases after the three villains all the way back to the fortress where Lois and Lex have been taken as well, and they force him to supposedly take away his powers again. In the end of course he tricks them and makes it so that they lose their powers instead, and he simply kills them like mortals, and he also reverses the mind of Lois so that she no longer knows Clark is Superman. Also starring Ned Beatty as Otis, Valerie Perrine as Eve Teschmacher, Jackie Cooper as Perry White, Marc McClure as Jimmy Olsen, Clifton James as Sheriff and E.G. Marshall as The President. Reeve still packs a punch as Superman, but is also sympathetic being Clark and in love, Kidder is down graded in the cast ranks but still a big part, Hackman still makes a great power hungry criminal, and Stamp does do very well as the emotionless super powerful villain. The special effects are reasonable in parts, including of course the flying, but it can be unintentionally laughable, the story is not bad, but sometimes cheesy with dialogue, it feels like it's going back to the roots of being a comic book and not grown up like before, but never mind, it's a little overrated by the critics, but a good fun fantasy action adventure. Superman was number 26 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, and he was number 72 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Good!

For lack of a better term, this film is simply light years ahead of it's two predecessors and then some. However, the film doesn't quite cross into that classic Bond territory that we all know and love. Lastly, the film is also Saltzman's last Bond film to be attached as producer before selling his share to United Artists.The film is interesting for two reasons. Firstly, the film has the best casting ever with Christopher Lee as Scaramanga and secondly, the whole cat and mouse idea between him and Bond, eventually leading to a duel between the two. The trouble is that the film adds a Solex Agitor plot in addition to the assassin vs. assassin plot and both are too loosely connected. The film would have been better without the Solex Agitor plot and played out like the novel - the cat and mouse game between Bond and Scaramanga. Furthermore, the Bond girl Brit Ekland is wasted by saying or doing stupid things and really fitting the bill of the bimbo Bond girl.Roger Moore's performance in this film is one of his better ones, second only to For Your Eyes Only. Furthermore, he is more believable as Bond since he is more ruthless and human-like in this film, unlike some of his other Bond films (not his fault really, his scripts often had him as a wise-cracking, superhero-type agent). Plus the script has him use harsher methods of achieving his objectives, namely smacking Maud Adams around and getting information at gun point. Lastly, he still looks youthful at this point, before his age caught up with him and losing any credibility in the role due to staying longer than he should have.Lee's Scaramanga is one of the better villains, if for casting alone. However, the trouble is the way the character is written; at the start of the film we learn that Bond is his next target but as the film goes on, he turns into something of a anti-villain. For example, when he and Bond meet, he says something along the lines of I've got nothing against you so therefore taking away the whole point of the story. However, it isn't all bad though, I found the Scaramanga of the film an improvement over the Scaramanga of the novel. In the novel, he's merely a gangster with a lucky shot.Simply put, The Man with the Golden Gun is the bridge between two horrible films and Moore's most definitive Bond film.

James Mason who is the Nabakovian character Humbert Humbert in the movie was 52 years old when the movie was made. The novel had great appeal for its human affinity with the ageing process and the resilience of youth. Humbert, a middle-aged aesthete. whom we are informed by the novel, has always had an irresistible attraction to the allure of young female flesh, finds himself drifting in his waning years in the backwoods of American College employment. Although, a hugely conscious observer of the human tableau, there is one aspect of his dreamy existence that he has no control over - that is his lust for young, pubescent proto-woman. The narrative arrives at a small mid-western town, where Humbert is to take up an academic position.Here, we, the audience, encounters the Shelley Winters character and her daughter Sue Lyons looking decidedly older than the 12 year old nymphet that the novel describes. At this point, having moved in, now,his testosterone has taken over, as the controlling power in his psyche. We are made aware as to Humbert's initial aversion, which he has to the vulgarity and lack of couth, which the Shelley Winters character has on him. This is then contrasted, and his intellectual prejudice is immediately dispelled by the sight of the young Sue Lyon Lolita displaying herself in an unselfconsciously sensuous bikini. Humbert's immediate reaction is one of sexual erectness. This futile lust, is where this tale of thwarted desire, begins.We, the audience, are also given insight into this lonely driven man's inner life, that is other than his interest in literature and poetry, by being made privy to his personal life in the confessorial entries to his diary. Here we learn that he despises his generous, hospitable hostess, and how he worships and adores the butterfly at chrysalis stage, the darling Lolita.

At this point, having moved in, now,his testosterone has taken over, as the controlling power in his psyche. We are made aware as to Humbert's initial aversion, which he has to the vulgarity and lack of couth, which the Shelley Winters character has on him. This is then contrasted, and his intellectual prejudice is immediately dispelled by the sight of the young Sue Lyon Lolita displaying herself in an unselfconsciously sensuous bikini. Humbert's immediate reaction is one of sexual erectness.

They then perversely invite the dead man's family and friends over for a dinner party with the body hidden just under their noses the whole time.Rope is most famous as a film of cinematic technique. More specifically it's an exercise in long unbroken takes. Due to the technology of the time the film could not be photographed in a single unbroken shot as it's director Alfred Hitchcock wished for, instead it was made up of half-a-dozen or so long single takes, most of which are edited together so that the breaks aren't too obvious. There is no denying that the result is a bit showy and is technique for techniques sake. Nevertheless the experiment is executed well and it does prove that Hitchcock truly was a cinematic innovator.Another daring element of the film is in its central two villains. Their whole motivation for the murder is intellectualized; a very cold, emotionless driving force where the victim was killed as part of some high-brow theory on homicide. It's an unusual idea to base a movie around. Even more daring is in the homosexual undertones clearly evident in these characters. This was a seriously taboo topic in the 40's, and while it's not made explicit it's certainly alluded to. Hitchcock was definitely going out on a limb with both the technique and content of this film.Despite everything, Rope is maybe too committed to its own experimentation to entirely work. The long takes make the film unavoidably stagey and while being cinematically daring, they simultaneously ensure the film can't use one of the prime advantages of cinematic art editing. As a result, Rope can at times drag a little and its story-line does seem to me to be just a little too artificial for us to buy the character actions entirely. Much of its experimentation was never really repeated again which perhaps gives an indication that maybe the method broke the mould here. Nevertheless, it remains something of a one-off and a genuinely interesting curiosity.

Due to the technology of the time the film could not be photographed in a single unbroken shot as it's director Alfred Hitchcock wished for, instead it was made up of half-a-dozen or so long single takes, most of which are edited together so that the breaks aren't too obvious. There is no denying that the result is a bit showy and is technique for techniques sake. Nevertheless the experiment is executed well and it does prove that Hitchcock truly was a cinematic innovator.Another daring element of the film is in its central two villains. Their whole motivation for the murder is intellectualized; a very cold, emotionless driving force where the victim was killed as part of some high-brow theory on homicide. It's an unusual idea to base a movie around. Even more daring is in the homosexual undertones clearly evident in these characters. This was a seriously taboo topic in the 40's, and while it's not made explicit it's certainly alluded to. Hitchcock was definitely going out on a limb with both the technique and content of this film.Despite everything, Rope is maybe too committed to its own experimentation to entirely work. The long takes make the film unavoidably stagey and while being cinematically daring, they simultaneously ensure the film can't use one of the prime advantages of cinematic art editing. As a result, Rope can at times drag a little and its story-line does seem to me to be just a little too artificial for us to buy the character actions entirely. Much of its experimentation was never really repeated again which perhaps gives an indication that maybe the method broke the mould here. Nevertheless, it remains something of a one-off and a genuinely interesting curiosity.

This is one great horror flick with all the right elements many of today's horror films are lacking.First, I was terrified by the stupid acting, and I'm not talking exclusively about De Niro, whose face is capable of making only one fixed expression -much like Paris Hilton- that never lets you know if he's happy, angry or just hungry. I am talking everyone especially that retarded moronic piece of acting by that kid before he dies in Noodle's hands in a performance worthy of the Golden Middle Finger Award.Then, the horror continues with me always on the edge of my seat and shivers going down my spine every time that painfully dumb harmonica plays in a pathetic effort to mimic the effect of the memorable sound track of Godfather.As time went on, I got more and more terrified when I started realising that I am actually wasting 4 hours of my life on a film that seemed not to have any story or a screenplay. I swear that at moments I had the feeling they were making it up as they go. I mean, random jumps between past and present in another laughable effort to mimic Godfather 2, no solid ground for the characters' developments, and nothing they do or say makes sense; We see the girl calling Noodles a cockroach then kissing him, we see him loving her his entire life then raping her in public (only few minutes after he read her a poem of his love!!), and, best of all, we see friends since childhood suddenly betraying each other and Max having his friends killed in a setup for no apparent (or even hidden) reason.Like any good horror movie, there must be a mystery to revolve around, so here we have the mystery of how an ex-criminal became a secretary in the government? Why he went through all that trouble to bring Noodles to kill him when he has the garbage truck to do the job? And the mystery of Noodle's son which he knew nothing about did they do that son thing because they love overused beaten to death clichés? or just because the film makers are sick puppets?

This beats the shock of that part where the girl is hanged on the hook in Texas Chain Saw Massacre and the discovery of who the mum was in Psycho!! And after all of this some still deny it's one of the great Horror films of all time?Seriously, thanks god for the presence of Jennifer Connelly.

The distraction is constant and you can't work, sleep or make love to your spouse.In desperation you seek out a therapist to find answers to the questions that plague you How did this film get made? Who sanctioned it? Has Willem Dafoe experienced any subsequent embarrassment? Who designed his suit? Have I seen any other movies this bad? Does the writer\/director really believe my IQ is sub-92? Who makes that kind of orangey fake blood, and why do they still use it when it looks so false? Have I seen acting this poor since our high school production of Grease? Has any previous movie stolen so widely, so indiscriminately, so artlessly and so cynically from forerunners upon whose success it's hoping to hitch a free ride?

I believe that you, as a potential viewer, need to ask yourself why that is. And when you go on to check those reviews you'll notice with a start that a lot of them exist purely because their writers needed to vent their spleen. Look at mine ...

Law is absolutely the key to this movie, IMO, and he's riveting. I would go so far as to say that he's the dominating figure in the film, which is all the more remarkable because of the physical limitations his role imposes on him. I believe the movie lives or dies depending on whether you find his character believable.Ethan Hawke in the lead role is also very good, but he just doesn't have the burning intensity that Law has. FWIW, the first time I saw Gattaca, I felt convinced that if Hawke and Law had switched roles, this would have been a much stronger movie. This is not to say that Hawke does a bad job, or is flawed in the role; it's just that when you contrast him with Law and consider the parts they each play, it's hard not to think that it would have been better cast the other way.Visually, Gattaca is a beautiful film. It cleverly invokes a feeling of a future time without having to rely on mind-boggling special effects and other technical wizardry; it's mostly a matter of clever choice of sets, the style of photography, and suggestion.The plot moves along at an easy pace to follow, and the resolution of the conflicts in the film is very uplifting. It's an easy film to feel good about when it ends.That said, there are some problems.One of the major problems for me is what I'd have to call the ewwww factor. Without spoiling the plot for anyone, let's just say there's a lot in this film about testing of bodily fluids and biological specimens. Yeah, they have to address this issue, but it's jarring to the point where there were some scenes where I disconnected with the film because of the ewwww factor. I don't know if this affects everyone, or just me.There is also somewhat of an issue of credibility of the major premise of the plot. I think it requires somewhat of a suspension of disbelief that was a real stretch for me at times. I know that there are some people who are going to watch Gattaca and just not be able to suspend disbelief, and those kinds of people are not going to like the film very much, if at all.I also think that to some extent, if you don't find yourself liking the Ethan Hawke character and identifying with him, you aren't going to like the film at all.Uma Thurman plays a character who is primarily a romantic interest, and she plays her part well, but she's mostly visual candy. I wish she had had a bigger part in the movie and had played her role in a less detached manner.So those are the pluses and minuses for this film as I saw them.

After two absolutely horrible films and one border-line film, The Spy Who Loved Me is the first truly classic Bond film since On Her Majesty's Secret Service in 1969.The Spy Who Loved Me is Roger Moore's most definitive Bond film, even though it isn't my favourite of the lot that he starred in. Everything works here, from the submarine lotus and the henchman Jaws to the classic pre-title sequence of Bond falling off a cliff with the Union Jack on a parachute and Moore coming into his own after two films. Furthermore, the film embraces the epic scope of Thunderball, You Only Live Twice and On Her Majesty's Secret Service that was surely lacking in the last three films. Lastly, the climax of a shootout with Bond and a private army raiding the villain's lair returns in this film.After two films, Moore finally comes into his own and shows that you don't have to be Sean Connery to be a good Bond (though Lazenby in On Her Majesty's Secret Service does a creditable job also). The film is noteworthy for it's villains. Jürgens's Stromberg is one of the best villains of the Moore era and gives a great performance of the aqua-loving villain. However, the film belongs to Richard Kiel as the 7' 2 henchman Jaws.A somewhat minor but important issue I have to pick with the film. At the Oscars for 1977, this film is the only one in the series to get a nomination for best original score. Many of the Barry scores, particularly On Her Majesty's Secret Service, were very much in deserving a nomination whereas this film is the only one of the lot to actually receive said nomination. I know this has more to do with the series as a whole, but I feel that I should mention it as many of the Barry scores were fantastic and were deserving of a nomination.Simply put, The Spy Who Loved Me is Moore's most definitive Bond film and deserves it's status as a classic film in the series.

Lastly, the climax of a shootout with Bond and a private army raiding the villain's lair returns in this film.After two films, Moore finally comes into his own and shows that you don't have to be Sean Connery to be a good Bond (though Lazenby in On Her Majesty's Secret Service does a creditable job also). The film is noteworthy for it's villains. Jürgens's Stromberg is one of the best villains of the Moore era and gives a great performance of the aqua-loving villain. However, the film belongs to Richard Kiel as the 7' 2 henchman Jaws.A somewhat minor but important issue I have to pick with the film. At the Oscars for 1977, this film is the only one in the series to get a nomination for best original score. Many of the Barry scores, particularly On Her Majesty's Secret Service, were very much in deserving a nomination whereas this film is the only one of the lot to actually receive said nomination. I know this has more to do with the series as a whole, but I feel that I should mention it as many of the Barry scores were fantastic and were deserving of a nomination.Simply put, The Spy Who Loved Me is Moore's most definitive Bond film and deserves it's status as a classic film in the series.

After two absolutely horrible films and one border-line film, The Spy Who Loved Me is the first truly classic Bond film since On Her Majesty's Secret Service in 1969.The Spy Who Loved Me is Roger Moore's most definitive Bond film, even though it isn't my favourite of the lot that he starred in.

All the usual John Sayles flaws are here &#x96; a rather plain aesthetic, shallow socialism, dated radicalism etc &#x96; but these should be overlooked. The actual narrative structure of the film is genius.Sayles opens on a school of fish, closely packed and teetering on the brink of suffocation. Later we will see them flopping about, dying on dry land. Their plight is mirrored to the inhabitants of small town Alaska, who face job cuts, the effects of mechanization and the encroachment of big tourist and logging companies. Like the fish, everyone here is slowly going extinct, their natural environment changing. This leads to several characters evolving different means of survival. These means of survival will get more desperate and violent as the film progresses, characters switching jobs, turning to trafficking drugs, murder etc. In other words, everyone in Limbo is caught in some form of limbo, Sayles documenting the lengths people will go in order to break free of their uncertainty (and to inject some modicum of hopefulness into the circumstances they find themselves).The film focuses on three characters an ex fisherman, a club singer called Donna, and her daughter. Suffocation or drowning motifs orbit around each of them. For example, the ex fisherman lost his friends\/family in a drowning accident, an event which put his own life in stasis. Likewise, not only is Donna's own career in limbo, the woman teetering between unemployment and stardom, but the status of her romantic life is always intermediate, the film opening with her being dumped by yet another boyfriend.As the film progresses, Donna and the fisherman will strike up a relationship, each rescuing the other from limbo. But this relationship, and their very survival, will then be swiftly called into question, as they're eventually marooned on an island. Throughout the film, individuals, corporations, couples, loners etc are all pushed onto a kind of precipice of uncertainty, always trapped between rescue\/survival and death\/extinction.The film's first half is radically different from its second half. In the first half, Sayles uses a multi-threaded narrative in which we're bombarded with information and characters. This is Altman territory, Sayles forcing us to tease out fragments of plot, the director relishing our confusion. We have no idea who our lead characters are, or what indeed the film is about.Nevertheless, important information is being conveyed here. A narrator welcomes us to America's last frontier and praises the country's natural wonders, but Sayles' ironic imagery conveys the opposite, treating us to images of Alaska's eradication, men in tacky animal suits, tourists lining up for tickets, and a barrage of inauthentic, cheap, tourist goods. Alaska's real nature is being bulldozed, and with it all authentic experience.As tourists descend upon Alaska, Sayles links them to dying salmon caught in nets and later dead fish hurling along conveyor belts. While this is going on, businessmen in charge of logging companies and tourist boards discuss things. We want to develop themes here, one says, speaking of his desire to set up little tourist theme parks. As he talks, assistants and servants dance about, tending to his every need. But these businessmen will be swiftly discarded in favour for the real Alaskan experience, Sayles focusing on a group of characters marginalised by gender, sexuality, race, age, economics etc. These characters, most of whom are disadvantaged, use a variety of different tactics to subvert or use to their own benefits the discourses at work around them. Their little battles are then morphed into the plight of three characters, the fisherman, Donna and her daughter, who find themselves stranded on an island. Existing off the tourist footpaths, this is the real Alaska experience (People pay money to go on trips like this!), the trio fighting off both wild nature and human competition.The island the trio find themselves on is called Kuleshov Island. We recall Russian film theorist Lev Kuleshov's Kuleshov effect, in which an audience is allowed to imbue blank images with their own story, emotions and effects. Kuleshov himself made a film, very similar to Limbo, titled By The Law, in which a group are stranded in Alaska and share a cabin in the wilderness. What Sayles does is use the Kuleshov effect to position the audience such that we resolve the film's story. Will our trio be rescued, or will they be sold out by a character called Smiling Jack (his name is itself suggestive of either benevolence or fiendish scheming - we choose)? Mirrored to this uncertainty is the film's embedded narrative. Here, Donna's daughter finds the diaries of a little girl who herself died on Kuleshov Island. This story-within-a-story is narrated by Donna's daughter who, when she reaches the diaries incomplete end, completes the story herself by imagining\/constructing the rest of the plot. In other words, she completes the girl's fate as we complete the fate of the current Kuleshov trio.So what we have is an ensemble (society) which is bulldozed to make way for the modern experience, a simulacrum of a dying reality. This abstraction is reversed by a fable-like story in which a small fragment or representation of society fight for survival on an island. Here, a trio symbolically battle over their fate (the fisherman's a dour realist, Donna's a blind optimist and the daughter is an artist\/dreamer). Kuleshov style, their fate is then left up to us. This, of course, like Sayles other implicative narrative (Passion Fish), directly implicates us in their plight, and enfolds us into the film. We, and cinema, are a part of the problem and a part of the solution.8.5\/10 &#x96; Sayles trades literal sermonizing for something more abstract. Ignore the film's many flaws. What Sayles is doing here is very rare. Worth two viewings.
