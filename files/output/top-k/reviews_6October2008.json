[{"date":"6 October 2008","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Poor Fanny Price. The Creepy Crawfords as well as a leering uncle and several other dubious relations work to get her into compromising situations-- The book is 1990s society but is portrayed in early 1800's period costumes and period dialogue. For instance, both of the Creepy Crawfords Mr. Crawford and his sister leer after Fanny...A transgender moment common in 1990's to 2000 film productions.Young women were tightly chaperoned back then and most would have actively avoided the appearance of a compromising situation. If their reputation was damaged, it could vastly change their life for the worse. Even Edmund, the one pure and decent person who Fanny eventually will marry, still talks with her while she is lying on top of her bed. And later, Edmund falls asleep during the carriage ride and leans against her partly bare chest long before they even get engaged. Too modern!!! Creepy uncle has been exploiting slaves in his overseas plantation. This very developed subplot is rather graphically shown through the anguish of one of his sons and through rather explicit drawings.The film is moderately interesting, but consider it a parody on Austen, not an interpretation. NOTE to wannabee Jane Austen film makers- Many reviewers here prize those films that stay true to the AUSTEN books! Those of you wanting to make a modern film - do it the Bridget Jones way.
