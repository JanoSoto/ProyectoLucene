Louis B. Mayer told her that it was on the black list as church and women's groups had banned it. However, when she wrote to the groups, they all agreed to lift the ban if she would personally be responsible for the film - Lillian Gish was a powerful symbol for purity in the twenties. The bleak theme and landscape of the story were second nature to Scandanavian film makers and Lillian was quick to hire Victor Seastrom to direct and a new Swedish actor, Lars Hanson, to star as the kindly minister. Even Henrik Sartov's camera-work had a magnificent but cold beauty, totally in keeping with the harsh New England scenery.Puritan Boston on a Sabbath day in June - Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale (Lars Hanson) is beloved throughout the county for his kindness and humility. Hester Prynne (Lillian Gish) is frowned upon - church goers see her running and skipping (she is trying to catch her canary) and that is forbidden on the Sabbath!!! For that she is put in the stocks but is rescued by the smitten minister who never realised that the committee would meter out such harsh punishment.It seems they are the only passionate couple in the county as they conduct their affair in secret, amid such rules as engaged couples' lips must only meet after marriage and women's under- garments must be washed and dryed in secret. Dimmesdale wants to marry Hester - but she is already married, forced by her father to marry a wealthy surgeon (Henry B. Walthall) who she hasn't seen for years. When Dimmesdale returns (he had taken a petition to England) it is to find that Hester is to be punished again - she has had a child out of wedlock. Once again Arthur wants to share her punishment but she is firm that she will not let him sacrifice the good opinion of his parishioners. She is forced to wear an embroidered A on her gown for her whole life - A for Adultress!!!Years pass and even though Hester and Pearl are shunned outcasts, Arthur is never far away. When Pearl is ill Hester rushes to the meeting hall to find a doctor. Hester's husband is there but although he recognises her, he is greatly changed and now goes by the name Dr. Chillingworth. He goes to her cottage and even though he says such a child should die cures Pearl. He is a vengeful man and wants to make Hester pay for her sins. He also finds out that Dimmesdale is Pearl's father but wishes to wait - my vengeance will be infinite!!! Hester and Arthur decide to go away - Arthur is losing his strength, but before they go he exposes himself as Pearl's father, before the town. He has branded an A onto his chest. The film ends with his death as Hester hopes for the beginning of kindness and understanding for her and Pearl.Lillian Gish's performance is so pure and true - there is no doubt, for people viewing this movie, that she could be the greatest actress of all time. In her early thirties at the time, she has a childlike happiness at the beginning of the film, which changes to bleakness in the harrowing scene when townsfolk are trying to take her baby. Lillian Gish had discovered Henrik Sartov when she was making The Greatest Thing in Life. He used a gauze over the lens, so I have read, to make her look even more youthful. Henry B. Walthall was unrecognisable in the small but telling role of Dr. Chillingworth.

Car's don't explode, they fly 50 feet away. Buildings don't fall down, they get incinerated. And if that's not enough, New York doesn't just get busted up, it gets leveled...along with every other major city in the world.There's only one guy ballsy enough to make this movie, and that's Roland Emmerich. Big just doesn't cut it. Nor does epic, for that matter. You have to at least admire a guy that completely skips on the kitchen sink and instead throws in New York, Los Angeles, The Presidency, and a space ship that's a quarter the size of our moon. Now THAT'S what I'm talking' about!Of course, it helps tremendously that Independence Day is immensely entertaining. The action, of which there is plenty, is exciting, and there are more one-liners than there are fingers and toes of you and the person sitting next to you. And, oh yeah, don't forget the creepy aliens.Anyway, the story stars on July 3, when radar picks up a signal coming from the moon. Then, after introducing us to the surprisingly vast array of characters, the alien ships show up. And they're not looking to become your next door neighbor. So after causing massive destruction, a few stragglers gather together to bring them down.Yes, that's vastly oversimplifying things. But for a movie that has so much going on, it accomplishes everything it sets out to do provide eye-popping action, and a good few laughs along the way. Nothing seems to be left out, and there aren't any glaring mistakes.The cast is made up of a few well known faces and a surprising amount of character actors. All of them do their job extremely well. Of them, Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Pullman can be considered the main characters. Will Smith is one of the most bankable actors in Hollywood, and it's not hard to see why. He has more range than is often recognized, and his screen appeal is undeniable. He also has considerable comic skill (after all, he was the star of one of the funniest sitcoms ever on TV). His performance as fighter pilot Captain Steven Hiller is among his best performances. Jeff Goldblum is once again playing a geek, but unlike Jurassic Park, Goldblum's David Levinson is not an egotistical jerk. He has solid chemistry with his co-stars, specifically Smith, and his father, Julius (well-played by Judd Hirsch). Bill Pullman is the weakest of the three, although that's hardly a damning statement. He acquits himself well enough amidst the surrounding talent, and never fades into the background (which he has done in other roles). The smaller roles are made up of recognizable faces, including Randy Quaid as an alcoholic pilot (played with the off-the-wall panache that only Randy Quaid can give), Mary McDonnell as the First Lady, Robert Loggia as a general, Vivica A. Fox as Hiller's stripper girlfriend, Margaret Colin as a Presidential aide (and David's ex). Cameos by Harvey Fierstein as David's co-worker and Brent Spiner as an off-the-wall scientist are also good. But special mention has to go to Harry Connick, Jr. as Jimmy Wilder, Hiller's best friend. Connick is electrifying, and often steals scenes from Smith (something that is quite difficult).This is summer fun, and Emmerich knows this. There's never a moment where it takes itself very seriously (even though there are a few times where the opportunity arises). Critics weren't very approving of this movie, and you know what? It doesn't matter. This is not an artistic movie of any sort. It's plain and simply entertaining.

Heather Langenkamp has been having nightmares of her fictional character's nemesis Freddy Krueger, and has also been receiving phone calls and mail from an unknown assailant. Later on in the plot it is discovered that Wes Craven has been working on a New Nightmare script that has already been put into production by the producers over at New Line. But what was thought to have only been a script has now turned into something even darker. An evil spirit has taken the character of Freddy, and is trying to get into the real world. Although to successfully do this, the spirit or Freddy must defeat and overcome the one who first gave him all of his power ten years ago, Heather Langenkamp or Nancy. But the big question is, is she willing to play Nancy one last time, and is she ready for what lies ahead? The premise of the story is well explained for the most part with only minor details that are left ambiguous to the viewers. However it's best not to over think the story too much, especially when it comes to movies of this genre, and simply go with it.Fans of Robert Englund might be disappointed that he has very little to do with the plot of this film, even though he plays himself and Freddy it is technically NOT him, but an evil entity of some sort who also only makes a full appearance towards the final half of the movie.

Heather Langenkamp has been having nightmares of her fictional character's nemesis Freddy Krueger, and has also been receiving phone calls and mail from an unknown assailant. Later on in the plot it is discovered that Wes Craven has been working on a New Nightmare script that has already been put into production by the producers over at New Line. But what was thought to have only been a script has now turned into something even darker. An evil spirit has taken the character of Freddy, and is trying to get into the real world. Although to successfully do this, the spirit or Freddy must defeat and overcome the one who first gave him all of his power ten years ago, Heather Langenkamp or Nancy. But the big question is, is she willing to play Nancy one last time, and is she ready for what lies ahead? The premise of the story is well explained for the most part with only minor details that are left ambiguous to the viewers. However it's best not to over think the story too much, especially when it comes to movies of this genre, and simply go with it.Fans of Robert Englund might be disappointed that he has very little to do with the plot of this film, even though he plays himself and Freddy it is technically NOT him, but an evil entity of some sort who also only makes a full appearance towards the final half of the movie.

THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS (1987) is the first to star Timothy Dalton as 007 and the fifteenth in the official canon. It's the one with the lady cellist, the pipeline to the West escape route, the milkman assassin, Bond as a sniper, the new 1980s Moneypenny, the carnival rides, John Rhys-Davies, the battle in the Middle East, and the ghetto blaster.Dalton only made two films as Bond, so his contributions often get lost in the shuffle. Still, this is one of my personal favorite Bond movies. I enjoy Dalton's take on the character and I much prefer this adventure to his second James Bond outing (the gritty LICENCE TO KILL 1989). Dalton is a classically trained Shakespearean actor and he's great at playing a modern-day (1980s) super-spy without imitating Sean Connery or Roger Moore. Dalton's 007 is less of a womanizing playboy; he's more human, and seems like a genuinely decent guy. This Bond film has a more realistic style than many of the earlier escapist fantasies, but it's still a lot of fun.The story takes us to Czechoslovakia, Austria, Morocco, and Afghanistan. Bond pieces together a plot by a maniacal arms dealer (Joe Don Baker) to play the British Secret Service and the KGB off one another in hopes of inciting World War III. The velvet-voiced John Rhys-Davies makes a memorable appearance as a KGB general. Maryam d'Abo plays the main Bond girl, a deceived cello player whom Bond grows fond of. My favorite part is the climax on the plane, where Bond must deal with just about everything (an enemy henchman, a open hatch, a bomb, an empty fuel tank).THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS seems a bit uneven because it simultaneously tries to continue in the decades-long tradition of the film franchise, while giving the series a fresh start to go with its new star. The basic format of the film is the same, with a pre-credits mini-adventure, a title sequence with a pop tune and a bunch of scantily-clad women, and some Cold War espionage thrills. Familiar characters like M and Q are carried over, along with Bond staples like the vodka martini and the innovative gadgets. But with Timothy Dalton's more natural approach to James Bond, the film takes on a more realistic tone. With the fresh new Bond comes a fresh new MI6 headquarters, filled with 1980s-era computer equipment. And the series gets a new Miss Moneypenny. (Caroline Bliss replacing Lois Maxwell after twenty-three years of service.) Although Desmond Llewelyn returns as Q to give the film some continuity, I always think of THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS as a sort of reboot of the Bond series.I always liked THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS. In my mind it is one of the better films in the Bond franchise. It easily cracks my top ten Bond movies, perhaps even making my top five. Dalton is great as a new type of James Bond. The action is pretty realistic for the mid-'80s, but still very exciting. This film even manages to capture a sense of romance, something that doesn't always play in Bond movies. Although Timothy Dalton's two Bond films are often overshadowed by the work of Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and Pierce Brosnan, this is one of the better 007 movies. Don't overlook THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS.

Cue an hour of paranoia, hysteria and lots of women screaming.In the late 50s, Invasion of the Body Snatchers quickly became a weapon for anti-communist campaigners, whilst others believed it to be either condemning or advocating McCarthyism (the act of accusing people of treason or communism without evidence). But the truth is, both the film's director (Don Siegel) and writer (Jack Finney) intended the film to be about conformity and the loss of free identities. The majority of people in the world are pods, Siegel would say in interviews, existing without any intellectual aspirations and incapable of love.

For Siegel, there was no Other out there scheming to take your bodies, rather, we are all already - and want to be - the villains. The pods confirm to the popular image of a communist totalitarian state only because a government-dominated, bureaucratic and conformist post war America was itself busily creating a picture of Soviet Russia. This is the world of Nietzsche's Last Men, post war Americans seeking only security, conformity and the comfort of mediocrity. Siegel thus challenges this repression by advocating a kind of beleaguered individualism and personal defiance. It's a metaphysical battle between society and the individual, not a political one, the villains both all around us and within us, and not from far across the sea. This world is long gone, however, which is why Siegel's film pales in comparison to Kaufman's 1978 remake. Kaufman's film sees the hopes of the flower power movement, and the rebels and oddballs of the 60s, crushed by a pod invasion that is global in scale, mankind evolving into a kind of homogeneous middle ground. Meanwhile, hippies and radicals morph into the materialistic yuppies of the 80s. The 2007 remake of this film, simply titled Invasion and starring Nicole Kidman, is even bleaker. Here, pod people have become the iPod generation, corporate power, saleable lifestyles, mass deindividuation and the commodification of alternative lifestyles blanketing the earth. Now, under multiculturalism\/globalization\/capitalism, difference is itself conformity. But, the film sarcastically argues, this is a good thing. A level playing field, a state of global equality, means less wars, less conflict, and a kind of comfortable middle ground satiated by mindless activities. Man thus becomes a kind of self excited organism, a pod person who works only hard enough to not get fired and is paid only enough to not quit, who lives in a state of mild indifference, punctuated by periods of dwindling passion. Nice.7.5\/10 &#x96; Howard Hawks' The Thing, made six years earlier, has aged far better than this little horror flick. Similarly, Kaufman's 1978 remake offers more scares, more creepiness and is still quite relevant to contemporary audiences. Worth one viewing. Makes a good companion piece to The Wanderers.

There are also frivolous fighting scenes with Asian gangs . Last scene with gripping racing was maybe good but not so much exciting to make some real action movie . There were so many faults in making this movie but I can say that in the other hand movie is looking good . There are some scenes with some stupid sense for excitement . I am not fond of this movie because there are so many silly scenes with some street gangs .

In terms of performances, John Ritter is lost at sea here not surprised seeing as how little he was given to do, and Amy Yasbeck's performance is pretty much a copyright of her performance in the first film.

However, this is just a bad movie - and not bad enough to be fun.Okay, with this genre of film, we can only expect teases of the beast prior to the climax. But the teases bring no drama. There is no excitement, no tension, mainly because the main characters have little interaction with the beast for most of the movie. Who is in danger? Where is the fear? The destruction by the sea beast and the hunt to stop it plays like a newsreel, not a story you get caught up in.The plot of this lame monster movie is driven by two pathetic techniques - the authoritative voice over, and the old meeting of the minds trick. The voice over may work in a crime drama but it fails for a sci-fi flick; it distances you from the action, hindering your envelopment within the make believe world of the film. The meeting of the minds is a classic tool of the lousy director; gather a bunch of people together and have a plodding discussion about what's happening so the viewer can be informed. Boring! And don't get me started on the wooden acting and awkward exchanges. Or were all the secondary characters actual members of the military? That would explain the bad acting. Faith Domergue is fine as the female lead but Kenneth Tobey as the macho sub commander on the make? Please, what would Faith see in that dud? But I do blame the director for the numerous ridiculous or poorly executed scenes. There are even a few occasions when actors stumble over lines but the scene was not re-shot.

I had watched Julia before, but I didn't see anything special about that movie. In fact, I only watched A Man For All Seasons because Robert Bolt wrote the screenplay. Bolt was the screenwriter of Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago, two cinematic masterpieces, plus Ryan's Daughter and The Mission, which deserve a modicum of respect too. With such a pedigree, I expected the best from Bolt's screenplay, since I'm a firm believer that any good movie begins at the writing.Well, A Man For All Seasons surpassed all my expectations. This is a fascinating movie in all its aspects an entertaining story, a beautiful historical recreation, and an intelligent exploration of duty, honor, truth, responsibility and moral convictions.The movie uses the life of Thomas More as a starting point to show the conflict he had with King Henry VIII over the Anne Boyleen affair. Henry VIII was currently married with Queen Catherine, his brother's wife. He had wedded her thanks to a Papal decree. But when the Queen is unable to give him an heir he decides to divorce her and marry another woman, Anne. This means he needs a new Papal decree overturning the previous one. He asks Thomas More's support, but More refuses on the grounds that he doesn't deserve permission to divorce and remarry.Nowadays Thomas More's adamant faith in the authority of the church may seem absurd, even ignorant, and his decision to die for his beliefs ridiculous. It's difficult to imagine a time when the Holy Church had so much power over people and a man could worship religion so much to give his life for it. But independently of what More believes in, the core of the matter is that he's a man standing up for his beliefs in name of a free consciousness.Paul Scolfield plays Thomas More with grace and a startling peacefulness. His words are always wisely chosen, pondered and calmly expressed in a gentle tone. He's the ultimate personification of reason, logic and nobility.Around his towering performance an amazing cast was gathered, starting with the always amazing Robert Shaw playing King Henry VIII. He shows up in only three scenes, two very small ones, and one that was the reason he got an Oscar nomination - in a scene when he meets More at his house to convince him to change his mind, Shaw plays the King as a maniac who unpredictably changes his personality from sweetness and pleasantries to violence and bullying. I've always loved Shaw because he never had any problems playing villains or unpleasant heroes, and here it shows how much fan he had playing bad guys.Wendy Hiller, Leo McKern, Nigel Davenport, Susanah York, a very young but amazing John Hurt, and an aging, fat Orson Welles complete the cast. A few words must go to Welles' performance - short as it was, playing Cardinal Wosley, it was amazing and also showed his ability to play villains.I can't find anything to say against A Man For All Seasons. From the moment we hear Georges Delerue's opening theme until the end, the movie does a good job of bringing the past alive, especially thanks to the Oscar-winning costume design and Ted Moore's cinematography. Watching this movie I in fact think cinema has regressed. Nowadays many movies have a teal and orange tone, so it was a delight to watch the vivid colors here. It's like one big rainbow, like watching The Wizard of Oz - and much like real life, since our eyes are closer to Technicolor than the washed-out, filtered colors we see nowadays in so-called realistic movies. The color red was especially omnipresent, and this type of symbolism just doesn't exist anymore in movies, which is a shame.Bolt, Zinnemann, Scolfield, Shaw, Welles, Ted Moore and many others are to praise for a man, that as the tagline says, truly is for all times!
