Although I rated it 10 after my first viewing, I'd rate it 20 after seeing it a second time. I remarked after seeing it the first time that its acting was very competent. This second time, not paying so much attention to plot, I could see that the acting of ALL the actors and actresses was superb, worthy of all sorts of Oscars--perhaps even a sweep, maybe for music, too. This movie is heads and shoulders above almost all other movies.During the first viewing, my impressions were on-the-fly reactions to plot, anticipation and surprise. With attention to plot out of the way, what I continuously noticed the second time was the extraordinary quality of everything in the movie.Concerns about violence in the movie are overblown and overstated. The violence was mild compared to most action movies. Instead of violence, emphasis was instead on murderous intent, upon the passions of the men and women for revenge, and not upon the blood, itself.I believed I understood the movie after my first viewing, which was that it was a morality play taught to a 21st century boy dragged back into time to witness up close this Shakespearean play. Now, after a second viewing, I'm not so sure I understand the ending. I'll probably have to see it a third time and listen more closely to the dialog.This is a highest-quality movie. You won't be bored, ever. It deserves multiple viewings. It's visually rich--and that's an understatement--in the best Felini style. The acting performances will always entrance the audience. I had much higher opinions of all the other actors besides the two or three most important ones, this second time around.This is more than a good movie. It's a masterpiece on a par with a handful of legendary movies. If you want a high-quality video (when it finally comes out), this is one that will entertain everyone on many different levels. But if you can, see it in the theater!I'd now agree that the director of this movie is a genius, just the hype says. This is a director to watch for in the future, like Felini.Again, don't worry about the violence. It's really low key compared with modern action movies. What makes it so much more riveting are the passionate performances of the actors and the focus on the intention of unrepentant revenge and viewing of some purely evil-minded people. I personally would highly recommend this movie for young-teen audiences, too, as a morality play with a message. This is high-school-class material that teachers should think about showing to kids and talking about it later.Don't miss the first minute of the movie, or you won't have a chance of understanding this movie adaption!

And I hated this movie. Not as much as Armageddon (I don't think I hate ANYTHING as much as Armageddon) but it's pretty high up there.I'll admit, Happy Gilmore was kinda funny, but every other movie Adam Sandler touches is pure comedic poison. Here, I'll sum up every Sandler movie Adam yells. Adam beats up people for no reason. Adam acts like a total retard. Adam speaks in funny (not really) voices. Idiots in movie theaters laugh. Adam rakes in $500 kajillion. Adam continues making crappy movies. Repeat ad infinitum. Why he continues to be so successful I don't know. But hey, in a world where Tom Green is considered funny (pfft, yeah right, about as funny as the holocaust) what more can you expect? I like crude humor as much as the next guy (I loved There's Something About Mary) but only when it's FUNNY.Every Adam Sandler movie has a premise of sorts. They figure hey, let's put Adam Sandler in a fun, wacky and zany situation! We'll have 'em lined up around the block! This time it's Adam adopts a kid Ho ho. My sides are splitting already, let me tell you!Adam is a law school graduate (the funniest thing about the movie. Adam Sandler as a LAWYER???? Bwahahahahaha...) who holds a toll booth job seemingly once a week, and yet can somehow afford to live in a gigantic New York apartment. One day a kid shows up at his door. He decides to adopt him (surprise surprise) and teaches him how to be an antisocial violent sociopathic moron who will probably end up in rehab by the time he's 10. See what a great parent he makes?We're supposed to laugh at him teaching the kid to throw sticks in front of rollerbladers. We're supposed to laugh at them peeing on the side of a building. We're supposed to laugh at Adam threatening a guy into handing over a ton of candy. Oh, and I forgot the most rip-roaringly funny scene of all Adam insulting his ex-girlfriend's older lover, commenting on his old balls. Is that supposed to be funny? Oh, it is? Oh. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Please excuse me while I collect myself after laughing myself silly.As can be expected, there's a crisis when the kid is going to be taken away. We're supposed to be sad about this; I consider it a cause for celebration. We're soon subjected to all sorts of sentimental awwwwwwww scenes that give Full House a run for its money. Break out the puke buckets - this one's a doozy.There is exactly one funny sequence in the entire movie the little kangaroo dance video. It perfectly sums up all those godawful kids videos out there, and it got some genuine laughs out of me. Then the kid pukes and ruins the whole scene. I also thought Adam getting hit by a car was funny, but only because watching him get hurt is always nice to see. Like he said himself, why couldn't the guy just kill him? But that's better than Billy Madison's 0 funny scenes, when you're forced to stare at the screen mouth agawk, mind burning out at the sheer stupidity of it all and realizing that 90 minutes of blank film would be a laugh riot compared to it.Oh, and Steve Buscemi's in this movie.

I liked the X-Ray shots during some of the fight sequences, but if a filmmaker is going to do that, go all out.  Don't use up your entire budget on just 3 shots.  Be an artist.6\/10.  The most clever thing about this film will always be its title.

When I read the book a couple of years ago, I remember thinking what a great movie it would make. When I heard that John Cusack would be starring in sort of an Americanized version, I could see it. Just the right fit.Now that I've seen the finished product, which is pretty much what I envisioned, I'm a bit disappointed. For one thing, I didn't expect Cusack's character, Rob Gordon, to talk into the camera all the way through the movie.  I thought they'd find a more inventive way to show the inner workings of this thoroughly confused person's mind.  Nearly every time Rob is talking to another character, he'll turn to the camera and give us his thoughts, sort of including us in the conversation.  I'm all for innovative filmmaking, but this just seems like a cop-out to me.  We like movies because they find ways to show what's going on in a person's head through their interaction with others and their behavior.  If they'd cut Rob's monologues, the film would have been a half hour long.  This type of blatant exposition is becoming a problem in the industry as a whole  too many thought-revealing voice-overs and other conversations that sound like someone reading from an encyclopedia.Not that high fidelity is a bad movie.  It's actually very amusing most of the time and I'm sure if I hadn't read the book, I'd have enjoyed it more.  Music and the intense emotions behind it create the film's landscape.  It's fun to watch the arguments over what songs belong in a certain `top five' list. In fact, Rob and his employees, Barry (Jack Black) and Dick (Todd Louiso), have a Top Five songs for every life situation.  For example when Rob's girlfriend's father dies, they create a `top five songs about death' as a tribute to the man, which is the only way they know how to express their sympathy.  The result of all the lists and mix tapes is a very eclectic mix of music of all styles and from all eras.  It's proof that when you mix it all together, you find that the old stuff is just as cool or, more times than not, cooler than the new stuff.Rob's Top Five All-Time Worst Breakups is the list on which the entire story is based.  He uses it to deal with his frustration over his latest breakup, Laura (Iben Hjejle).  This is one area in which the film improves upon the book  Laura's character is more fully developed here.  Rob comes up with the list just so he can leave her off of it, to prove how little she really mattered to him (when in fact, she's the love of his life).  High-profile actresses Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor, and Lisa Bonet take small roles as the other loved and lost women of Rob's life.  Rob is not an easy guy to like, the way he uses these poor women just to sort his own feelings out.Seeing the film version makes me want to go back and read the book, a format in which the narrator is welcome to express his feelings right to the audience.

Creepshow would later inspire the horror series Tales From The Crypt. Crafted perfectly from the old 50's EC comic books all five Creepshow stories have bad people getting comeuppance. I first saw Creepshow in 1987 on Cinemax, and over the years from 1991 to present viewed the film about 30-35 times on TBS, TNT, and home video etc. I finally purchased my own copy in 1997.

High Fidelity almost plays like a sequel to Say Anything, one of Cusack's first and best films.  Throughout the years he's done some great stuff such as Grosse Pointe Blank, but it's great to see him take a role like his Lloyd character in Say Anything.  This film works on so many levels that it's hard not to like it.  The best element that it offers is the same as Say Anything did, no matter how old you are, you can relate to what he's going through.  Some great supporting characters are seen here, his employees especially.  Tim Robbins and Catherine Zeta Jones do a great job with their cameos.  I've always liked John Cusack throughout his career, and High Fidelity only makes me like him more.  He really is one of the coolest actors out there and I hope we see more of this in the future.  It seems every time John and Joan are in a movie together the film automatically becomes great.  Screenwriters, Directors, and Actors take note, this is a comedy\/drama you can learn a lot from.

This movie is partly special effects, which is what all the critics couldn't get past. Horror movies to me are also mostly psychological. If the movie can hit and maintain that one disturbing note than it has worked. The Thing keeps that note vibrating through the whole movie. The intrigue and tone is set in the first five minutes.(Not the unnecessary opening titles) What a great way to start a movie and make the viewer think.Yes this movie has incredible effects but they are all secondary to the story. This movie works on so many different levels you can't pigeon hole it because of it's special effects. The special effects are just what's on the surface. The movie works because of the story.The Thing actually makes you think. It's kind of a twist on the who done it mystery. Everything works perfectly. The simplistic heartbeat like score from Ennio Morricone. The isolated setting. The acting. The editing. The great cinematography.Although each character isn't overtly developed, there is a lot of subtlety (something all too rare today) in each performance.This is probably Kurt Russell's best performance. Not that he has a lot of dialogue. It's all in the facial expressions and what he doesn't say but rather communicates with body language. Like when he removes his hood in the climax.Another key performance is Keith David's. Watch his fearful face when he is tied up. His performance in this has made me a fan of his work ever since.Everyone is good in this movie. Other than the effects nothing is thoroughly spelled out for you. It's up to you to figure out just what happened off screen. Something they also don't do anymore. Everything is now hammered into your head.The scariest things are what your own mind comes up with when posed with a few facts and images. Sometimes it's scarier when you don't see the monster. This film really couldn't of done this with respect to the monster but it did make use of that concept elsewhere. Even though it's kinda like Invasion of the Body Snatchers. It works better this time knowing what the monster's ghastly intentions and forms are.  Instead of the don't get caught (sleeping or awake) mentality of Body Snatchers, The Thing's mentality is best summed up by the original story's title Who goes there, which I recommend reading.Great line from the movie.You gotta be **cking kidding.Note Buy this on DVD, it has got to be one of the most comprehensive and feature packed DVDS out there.

Some may see these as spoilers...)--He has a dialog directly with the viewer, that dialog is often in the very context of the action, and the matter of the dialog is substantially different (more honest) than what he has with any character.--One episode has three different versions. This is a part of the dialog with the viewer. It is a point of art that the effect is only used once.--The dialog is essentially about the relationship between events and the soundtack of life as if it were a movie, so when a musician (Bruce Springsteen) comes from the soundtrack to the action, it blurs the distinction. Very clever.--As the film is about music as analog (using someone else's poetry to annotate or even activate your life) it's rather elegant how Cusack has created a soundtrack for us in precisely the way he creates DJ tapes, like the one for his wife at the end.This film takes intelligent chances with that tough boundary and makes them work. Worth seeing. ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music"}]
