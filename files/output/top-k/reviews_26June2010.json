[{"date":"26 June 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Darren Aronofsky treads waters I believe no director has treaded before. His entire film depicts the theme of the nature of drug addiction. The four characters affected by it provide a stronghold for Aronofsky's point. Never have I seen a film that delves deep within the soul and changes a person. If you have any sort of addiction at all, watch this film, it will change you. I guarantee it. Many people hear and even comprehend the downside to every addiction. But until you see it in plain black and white you do not know what you are really going through. See, an addiction is able to continue its course of poisoning the soul because it masks the truth from the being it parasites from. That person believes they are in euphoria. Yet, to everyone else, they look utterly ridiculous. It takes watching addiction run its course to realize our own addictions and how to resolve them. Aronofsky realizes this and geniously uses cinematic techniques such as change in tone, setting, and trippy special effects to come across with his point. The tone of the film shifts as the addiction takes over. It becomes more grimy as the film progresses. The setting adds to the grimyness of the plot seeing as the main characters live in a less fortunate or ghetto neighborgood. Last of all the trippy special effects are straight disturbing and strike the soul within the human being watching the film. It makes one realize that they think they may have it so great. But anything you are addicted to it too good to be true. Overall, Aronofsky crafts a film that delves deep within the conscience of the human mind. It does more than any other film I have ever seen. Every thing in this film was perfect for the message Aronofsky was trying to accomplish. It takes seeing this movie to really understand the impact of the message portrayed. I can honestly say that I am a changed person after watching this film and I highly suggest you watch it, no matter who you are. No matter if you have an addiction, know someone who has an addiction, or have no addiction at all. This film will open your eyes to the reality of life and make you want to help those who succumb to their own minds and give into impulsive demands. Ten stars for this one. A truly perfect film.
