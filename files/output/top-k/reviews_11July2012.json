The good points are that it's an ambitious film that makes a serious attempt to show the changing lives of three different men from the barrio from the time they are about 18 to when they are 30. They are bound together by blood, by background, and by gang. But their actions eventually lead to one being in jail, another being a cop and a third being an artist.This is not Manhattan Melodrama, however. There is far more realism. Most of the focus is on the prison life of Miklo (Damian Chapa). In the prison are three gangs, divided by race brown, black, and white. Their rivalries for power play a critical part in the film, and it's almost as much about these gangs as anything else. This is a strong point of the script. The character arcs of the three leads create another strong point.The main problem with the movie, in my opinion, is the direction of Taylor Hackford. There are simply too many scenes in which the actors are shouting at each other at the top of their lungs. The director should also have had a hand in cutting down the excessively wordy lines that clutter up many scenes. A movie is not a book. There are some group scenes that are not well staged or managed at all and in which the result is awkward. The script has too much verbal exposition and explanation. It has clichés and lacks progressive tension, but good direction and acting might have overcome these issues. Unfortunately, it seems to me that the acting abilities and charisma of the actors varied widely. They just didn't all pull off their roles. Some did, and others didn't.I was straining to watch this one to the end. I didn't find it particularly engaging and that's due to how it was written and executed, not the story or characters.UPDATE After writing the above, I went back and read my review of Against All Odds by the same director, written more than 2 months ago. Interestingly, some of my criticisms of that movie are similar to those made here. ","genre":null},{"date":"11 July 2012","score":"","review":" This movie is average. It's a 5 or a 6.

The directing, the writing, the acting, the music, all brilliant and completely immerses you in the violent yet alluring world Scorsese has created. Even as you watch these people do horrible things and pay dearly in the end for their actions, you still kind of leave thinking Being a gangster seems pretty sweet. One of the ways the film tricks you is by making these characters likable. Henry is charming, Tommy is funny (although don't call him that!), Jimmy is everyone's big brother. I think having charismatic leads really sucks you in, justifying their despicable behavior.
