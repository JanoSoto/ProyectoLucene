Shrek for a first time watcher is a movie that can fascinate you by its sheer screen play, choreography and free flowing dialogue. An ogre who lives in a dirty swamp trying to get rid of the fairy tale creatures who have occupied the swamp due to the their eviction of Lord Farquaad goes in search for rescuing princess Fiona in order to get his swamp back. He is accompanied by the annoying talking donkey and the story unfolds when the rescued princess Fiona and shrek fall in love with each other. Eddie murphy is a perfect fit for the Donkey's voice. Right from the word go when the Donkey hits shrek in his back, he talks like a chatter box much to the frustration of shrek till the time he gets used to it. ( For 5 minutes could you just not be yourself - Shrek 2)The Donkey is shrewd enough to quickly understand shrek's inferiority complex which he has developed over years as none likes him as he is an Ogre. It is the world that seems to have a problem with me. People give one look at me and cries. A Big, stupid, ugly ogre. They judge me before they even know me. That is why i am better off alone. and then when Donkey replies that when he met him he did not think shrek was a Big, stupid, ugly ogre. And it was so touching when shrek acknowledges this saying  Ya, I know. It is a deep freindship that is shown here.Donkey more than shrek takes your heart with its friendship, his love with the dragon, his concern for his friend to win in his marriage and his appetite for being brave. A True Noble steed indeed. On a whole, Shrek is a Beautiful Love story told in a most fascinating fassion with full of comedy. A Picture Perfect in a true sense.
