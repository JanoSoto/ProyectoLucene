It uses numerous Deus Ex Machina for the sake of using them. One might feel there's the use of retconning here too, but again, even those were completely out of place.It is pretty much a family movie (far more so than the first one) but some young children could be scared by the mummies. For the most part it is upbeat and doesn't ever give you the feeling that anything will go wrong.Synopsis Bad guy comes back to beat another bad guy to rule the world and the good guys try to stop them all. Most of the characters do a lot of traveling and then have a showdown. Mixed in is some chumming of the good guys that leads no where. Plus they add fate\/destiny stuff just to make sure we don't get any more sequels.It assumes the audience has attachment to the characters and assumes you feel the good guys are a tight group but never really builds that up. It's hard to tell if the movie was just poorly made, or if there was really a much grander and broader story that had to be cut down to a couple hours.The acting is okay except for Patricia Velasquez who seemed wooden, but that might have been the directing and not her. She was quite sexy, so it balances out. Rachel Weisz was far sexier in this movie than the first, and the rest of the cast does okay; certainly Brendan Fraser is very comfortable in his role as Richard 'Rick' O'Connell.If you watch it right after the first movie, you'll notice clearly that the CGI is a lot worse in returns. This adds to the idea that it was just a poorly written movie to cash in on the first movie's success. Besides the poor CGI, the action sequences really are quite well done. They're easy to follow, are fast paced, and include more dynamics than the rest of the movie.This is a different movie than the first one. It's less Indiana Jones and more.... well think of a bad kids movie that's supposed to be an adventure but seems silly.It really doesn't feel like it meshes with the first movie (especially the love between Anck Su Namun and Imhotep), and while it introduces the Scorpion King idea, it again doesn't mesh with that movie at all. Unfortunately I think it ended this franchise when it really should have spring-boarded a series of movies had it been done with more thought.With all of that said, ultimately it is a fun movie if you don't care about verisimilitude and as I said, most people would see it as fun for the whole family. It just lacks depth, solid writing, directing, and decent CGI. If you can snag it cheap, you'll feel like you got your money's worth. It isn't one of those movies where you just feel cheated for your time. It's okay, fluffy fun; just turn off your brain first.

I'm open to a great man narrative but at 4 hours, I'd like other supporting ideas, and belonging to the most advanced species on the planet, I have this goofy idea that a movie should ask me to think. At it's worst, Lawrence is a motion-postcard.

Even by the half hour mark, it's really well-made; editing, crisp lenses, great restoration. As epics go, it one-ups competitors like Spartacus by shooting every single exterior scene in the great outdoors, and never cheating inside the studio. It's also remarkable to see a director in the 60s willing to shoot at a darker end of the spectrum than Hollywood is comfortable with.But the movie is a hard sell. Maurice Jarre's theme is shoved down your throat at every opportunity. In a 4 hour movie, it would have been nice if subsequent musical motifs were developed. Whoever decided we should first hear the theme under the credits, while we look down at ten square yards of a motorcycle court should be shot. Is there something transcendent about concrete?

I deliberately avoided this movie at the time so as not to color my direction any particular way. The way I see the play is a couple of old guys sitting around a resale shop talking about stealing a guy's coin collection, sort of fooling themselves into thinking they're even capable of such a thing. My ideal cast would be (undead) Lemmon and Matthau, but it could also work with some very young people who don't know better. The point is, the crime is that distant idea which is captivating, but an impossibility. It's like folks who dream about winning the lottery and imagine what they'd do with those vast riches, but know inside that it'll never happen.This movie's mistake, in my eyes as a one-time director, is that it almost makes the crime plausible. Don, owner of the shop, and Teach, his talkative buddy, go through the plan of what to do when they get to the guy's house. How do they get inside? Go through a window the guy left open. What if there's no window? There's always something - kick in the door if you have to. Okay, where does the guy keep his coins? In his desk drawer. How do you know? C'mon, they have to be in there. If he's got a safe? Find the combination written down somewhere in the house. What if he didn't write it down? Everybody writes it down! How do we even know he's not home right now? They call the number and are shocked when someone actually answers. But they dialed the wrong number anyway. The long discussions these two have about the plan is a lot like some little kids having a play war in the backyard. No detail of the fantasy is too small and if things don't work out, you can always whip out an imaginary sword and gut your enemy, just like Teach plans to somehow find a safe combination hidden somewhere in a whole house.This play always worked better as a sad little comedy to me. The movie's director, one Mr. Michael Corrente, has turned it into a real caper movie! That's too easy a choice to make, too on the nose, and it doesn't allow the audience to see the irony of these washed up crooks trying desperately to convince themselves that they've still got what it takes. I never saw these guys as taking the whole thing too seriously as an actual thing that they were going to do. I just see Lemmon and Matthau trying to entertain themselves with the notion that they're going to commit a crime together, like the old days. Maybe Teach thinks it's a real thing, but not Don. Don is just the one who plays along with Teach's wild fantasies. Not in this movie. Here Don is every bit as committed to the theft as Teach, and just as devastated when it looks impossible.

Oldman grew up in the poorest ghetto of South London, where this film takes place.And while rumored and believed to be a semi-autobiography of Oldman's childhood and family (who wouldn't watch this movie and believe so?), Oldman himself has said that this is not him or his family.Hey, I believe him. Although he grew up in this environment, he was not directly in the line of fire, if you follow me.Nil By Mouth represents many of the other families in South London, not Oldman's. We've seen many abusive types in movies--usually one-dimensional and sanitized. But Oldman refuses to white-wash. The fact that this is not a big-budget Hollywood star-vehicle allows this to be a real film-going experience.This is one of those frightening on-screen performances in recent memory. Ray Winstone deserves high praise and immortalization for his acting here in the role of Ray. He seems to be one of those unsavory, brutal characters in movies that stay with us. Like Hannibal Lecter in Silence Of The Lambs, Like Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet, Like Norman Bates in Psycho, this performance haunts us like a ghost.Ray is not merely an abusive drunk; he is a horrible bastard, always prone to violent outbursts. When his wife hangs out with a casual male acquaintance, he suspects the worst. And does the worst.Ray Winstone delivers a powerhouse performance in the role of Ray, a working-class man who loves his family, especially his daughter. But this man has demons that are so numerous and deep, they cannot be repressed. He can be a likable, laid-back guy, like everyone else.But we see that without serious provocation, he instantly becomes raving and homicidal. A side that most movies (and people) tend to shy away from. He'll make your blood run cold and make you cry right along with him.Kathy Burke, best known for her role on Absolutely Fabulous takes an enthralling dramatic turns as Valerie, Ray's wife who's sole purpose seems to be to keep the family strung together while putting up with her husband's monstrous outbursts, almost sadomasochistic ally. This is an unforgettable performance.Whenever there's someone like Ray, there's almost always someone like Mark. Mark is sort of a sidekick or cheerleader for Ray and his violently domestic antics. He seems to be something of a drama queen, hitching his trailer up to the pain in Ray's life. It perhaps gives him an excuse to explode and go ape-s**t the way he does. It's mentioned at one point that Mark himself was worked over by Ray's father---maybe this explains the tie that bond these two.Jamie Forman is effective as Ray's little right-hand man. Apparently, Forman himself is the son of a real-life legendary London gangster.Is he just a great actor? Jamie may actually have some demons himself.And while Ray may be the black sheep of this family, all that really means is he's the blackest of the black. No one here is walking on water. Valerie smokes and drinks despite knowing full-well she's pregnant. No one around her really speaks up in protest about her indirect poisoning of her child.Valerie's little brother, Billy is a severe heroin addict. Despite the fact that he's occasionally allowed to sleep over at Ray and Valerie's, Ray even feeds him and gives him a banknote here and there, Billy steals a score of dope from their flat.You can only imagine how Ray takes to this. Billy is scorned, but although he is cast out, he still stays with his side of the family and even retaliates against Ray, stealing an irreplaceable family heirloom.Billy is a severe junkie and spends a lot of time with his friends. And since Billy is a junkie, there's only one kind of clique of friends he can afford more junkies.One of his pals, Danny is one of the movie's strangest characters. Danny is literally covered from head-to-toe with tattoos and body-piercing. He defines the term body art. His whole body is like a big collage explosion.But he's not the one-dimensional freak\/weirdo\/thug we'd expect just by getting a quick glance at him. He shows compassion and even sweetness at time like all the other characters, even Ray.Nearly everyone drinks and smokes. Nearly everyone says fuck and cunt on a far more-than-regular basis. And their endless stream of profanity and brutal violent mistreatment of one another is like a sad testimony to how tragically pathetic they are.And we can't help but think about the little five-year old daughter and the unborn second child of Ray and Val, how their parents impact will undoubtedly shape them. It is running rampantly throughout the world, and shows no signs of breaking.You can almost hear the violins playing on the soundtrack to their lives. They are the victims of their life, their family, their environment, each other and themselves.Oldman films using the now-traditional and all-too-common (but at the time, novel) hand-held camera technique and 16mm film, thus giving Nil By Mouth not the look of a polished, slick and lavish film, but raw, unkempt footage of very real life.

Hanks is woefully miscast as a guy who's supposed to come off as a selfish jerk (it doesn't help that I can't help but imagine Tom asking viewers to donate to a WWII veterans memorial). When he borders on the icy cold determination of someone who believes they are bound for greatness but are relegated to mentor and also-ran, the movie and Hanks hint at greatness. But ultimately the role should have gone to someone more adept at playing selfish jerks I imagine a young Kevin Spacey or a world-wearied Richard Belzer.The real problem is the utter flatness of Sally Field's crowd-winning jokes. Was I the only one groaning in horror at her Z-rate, HBO late-night schtick? The idea that she's a stunning new talent in the cutthroat world of 80s stand-up is unthinkable (I can't remember what documentary it was, but I saw an excellent collection of comedians talking about the desperate need to be the next Eddie Murphy and later the next Roseanne\/Seinfeld). That's where the movie fails it suggests that Hanks is just too unrelentingly cruel and embittered to attain stardom, while Fields good-natured hilarious insights into real-world pressures make her a guaranteed crowd-pleaser. Neither fully embody their roles convincingly, and the writer just doesn't know good comedy.

I'm giving it a four based on the gleam of promise in Hanks' otherwise unconvincing turn and the faint hope that he could actually portray a genuinely unlikable character in the future (though I doubt it considering a similar misstep with Bonfire of the Vanities and his lovable hit-man in Road to Perdition).

They're not funny, they're interesting to watch. Jeremy Renner is the ringleader, an under-achiever who has accepted his limitations and blindly corrupts logic to break the rules. He should have been a break out star, but the direction doesn't explore his comedic chops and he is forced to mug, grimace and cow tow to the rest of the cast. The true funny presence to watch is character-actor Kevin MacDonald as the psycho Trekkie with a chip on his shoulder who wants to takeout Renner's character for years of psychological abuse; he's the one to watch here as he goes through abuse after abuse and realizes the things he learned from Star Trek don't help him in the real world. Matt Frewer is wasted as an exasperated, harried and frustrated principal stuck in one mode as the kids push him over the end; he's pretty much the kids patsy and victim from one end of the movie to the other. Eric Edwards plays a forced Belushi clone an sleepy yet vice-driven imbecile without morals, but without any of the charm, humor or presence of John or Jim Belushi. (To see him now, you'd never expect he was the same actor!) Tommy Chong is stuck in the same one-joke cliché role he plays in every movie a conspiracy-talking pothead who is his own worst enemy. It's a shame he's written off so early; investigating his life would have been more interesting. My favorite character is Carla Morgan played by Tara Charendoff; she oozes sex and kittenishly moves through the movie possessed by Marilyn Monroe showing off the full range of her acting ability. The plot is weak; it runs like a documentary of high school rejects attached to a loose sequence of comedic criminal events and unfunny disasters filled with a huge cast of unknowns. Only Charendoff and Nicole DeBoer would go on to any greater success. It lacks the spirit of Animal House, the humor of John Landis or the commentary of Harold Ramis, and yet, you wonder what sort of damage these kids could do somewhere else and there, there is the one saving point of this film that you wonder what happens to them next.

It lacks the spirit of Animal House, the humor of John Landis or the commentary of Harold Ramis, and yet, you wonder what sort of damage these kids could do somewhere else and there, there is the one saving point of this film that you wonder what happens to them next.

After all, they'd struck gold - and then some - with WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT and DICK TRACY. Like THE ROCKETEER, those two films had also been lightweight, glossy adventures set roughly during the World War II era. Who's to say that anyone might possibly have suspected that lightning wouldn't necessarily strike a third time? (Then again, we've all heard the expression about three strikes and an out.) I was ten years old on that summer day when my little sister and I were taken to see this. I had no inkling at the time that it had been based on a comic book, but I didn't care; I didn't read comic books then. All I knew was that it had been produced by Disney (a sure-fire name brand for reeling in kids like my sister and myself) and that it was set in midcentury America (a time and place that I had always regarded as colorful and lively) in my mother's hometown of Los Angeles. I didn't expect a masterpiece....but then I didn't expect to be left cold, either.I think my greatest problem was with the actors who played the hero and heroine Bill Campbell and Jennifer Connelly. Campbell had very little charisma; and Connelly....well, she might as well have been a very lifelike robot. They were so boring that I found myself rooting for Timothy Dalton's suave and sinister bad guy. If your film's protagonists inspire nothing but apathy from the get-go, you're already in serious trouble.The plot was so superficial and generic that it could indeed have been plucked from a 1930s Saturday matinée serial. The concept of a Nazi takeover of America using Howard Hughes's jet-pack device seemed like an afterthought. Why were there even Nazis in this, other than that a posse of well-dressed Mafiosi (led by Paul Sorvino) didn't exactly present a credible menace? The answer, of course, is that you can inject Nazis into anything and the plot will automatically become sexier. There's really nothing wrong with this (the INDIANA JONES films and Disney's own BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS had also served up Nazis for a family audience); the problem here is that, unlike in other films, here Nazism seems more like a spice rather than an essential ingredient. Even worse, we are never offered any justification for why a wealthy and personable actor like Neville Sinclair would ever be attracted to Nazi ideology.For a supposed action film, THE ROCKETEER features precious little action and spends way too much time on plot exposition during the first half of the movie. The romantic subplot could have been totally written out, as well as the aforementioned Nazi element. Kids like movies with stories in them, but not if those stories are overly convoluted. At the end of the day, we just want to see a guy in a rocket suit beating up villains.(On a side note Why would Germany be sending a passenger zeppelin around the world in 1938 - a full year after the Hindenburg disaster?) Is there anything at all good about THE ROCKETEER? Sure, there are many things good dialogue, good music, good special effects, and (in the case of a mob goon named Lothar who looks like he could have made a cameo in DICK TRACY) excellent makeup. But none of these things can ever truly save a movie whose story is weak and whose characters (except for Sinclair) are indeed as paper-thin as the comic-book creations that inspired them.

He was great in both Wayne's World movies, he was one of the reasons Saturday Night Live became funny again, he's always been hilarious when he's guest hosted SNL in later years, and his stand-up comedy, most especially his 1995 HBO special that aired frequently on Comedy Central, is uproariously funny.For those reasons, I really wanted Dana Carvey to make a big screen comeback and have a movie career as illustrious as Mike Myers'. However, I hope he gets another chance in the next few years with a supporting role in a better movie, because The Master of Disguise is so much of a disappointment I feel embarrassed for Dana Carvey.That's not to say that Dana Carvey doesn't have some moments of brilliance. His Al Pacino and George W. Bush imitations are both funny and on target, but everything else from his annoying Italian accent to his basic dialogue to his name (Come on, Pistachio?) bury those funny moments like a huge pile of rubble and scrap metal. This movie isn't like a car crash it's like a wrecker carrying away the aftermath of the crash to the dump, and it's much easier to look away from that scene.Even though James Brolin, Harold Gould, and Jennifer Esposito obviously did their best with what was given to them, the movie as a whole just suffered. You can't blame them for not trying though. Highly anticipated movies like this usually suffer from a weak script, a disappointing ending, or the primary cast being so eclipsed by their fame and reputation that they show up to shoot drunk and stoned, and their jadedness shows through the screen. Fortunately, the latter wasn't true for this movie, but it still needed some major work.Since this movie bombed critically and commercially, Dana Carvey hasn't made any public appearances that I know of either in movies or on TV. I have the feeling, however, that the next project he works on, whatever it may be, will truly be a big comeback for him.

I Loved this movie & I love Moira Kelly. She's so cute, attractive & pull out some act in this movie. It's a typical sport movie where they have to partner, work hard & win the competition in the end. The road to reach there, the struggle & the situation surrounding it is the one that makes it difference. It's a light hearted movie and I might be biased but ever since I watch this movie I wish I'll be able to skate. It's funny, it's witty, it shows that hard work will pay off in the end and you shouldn't judge a book by its cover and give everyone a chance and encourage them rather than shutting them off. 7 out of 10.

I don't know if this is deliberate or just the way her face comes across when filmed from different angles and with different lighting. At the risk of sounding as though I'm only focusing on her physical appearance, she sometimes appears radiantly beautiful, other times cute in a tomboy-ish way, and sometimes downright unattractive. I mention this because there are a number of quirky details in 'Silence of the Lambs' that one only picks up on with repeated viewings, and they all fall together in such a casual, unforced way that it's easy to believe they just happened. But no film turns out this well by accident. The director, Jonathan Demme, might have gotten lucky with one or two shots but I have to believe nearly everything in this movie was calculated to create the exact effect each renders. Anthony Hopkins had, prior to 'Lambs,' never been a favorite actor of mine. I was never particularly impressed with him in any role. In fact, it would be hard to think of one part that Hopkins was really identified with. But if ever the actor and the character and the moment came together in perfect realization, it was in this film. Hopkins grasps the complexities of Hannibal Lecter and presents them in such a way that it is now impossible to think of one and not the other. Just as Thomas Harris does in his books, Lecter is on film depicted as a cannibalistic madman but so much more than that; he is polite, resourceful, intolerant of most other criminals, tasteful, sophisticated... not to mention a genius. Given what Hannibal has done in the past and has every intention of doing in the future, his character would seem the most unlikely to appear even slightly sympathetic to the audience. And yet he does. Clarice Starling is a more straightforward character, easier to figure out, but Jodie Foster embodies her in a similar way. She is single-minded, on an almost holy quest to achieve success as an FBI agent, to rescue the helpless and imprison the guilty. She pushes herself relentlessly though Starling is not typically reflective unless forced into it by Lecter. When he tells her during their first meeting, You're so ambitious, aren't you?, he has her nailed, dead to rights. Over the course of the film, Hannibal Lecter begins to display other qualities that almost qualify as superhuman. He is immensely strong. He can apparently control and manipulate his body's functions to create false readings. He seems at times capable of both telepathy and empathy. Nothing supernatural is suggested, only such finely-honed skills of observation and reasoning that not even the smallest detail escapes his notice. And most importantly, he never fails at anything he sets out to do. By the end of the film, one is convinced Lecter could have escaped from that jail cell anytime he wanted. In fact, his escape from the cage in Memphis is so improbable that in retrospect it borders on magic. For everything to have happened in the order it did and with the precise timing it needed to happen beggars belief, to say the least. And yet it is so well-staged, and we are so convinced by this point that Hannibal is perfectly capable of pulling it off, the audience never questions it.
