The style is brilliant with its freeze frames, interludes, and complete acts of seeming-randomness all in the name of set-up.The gender dynamics are also hilarious with Broderick's temptations by women and how he gives into them one way or another (whether it be sleeping with them or rigging the election), he can't win. For example (and this film is filled with them), Broderick is tempted to sleep with a friend of the family (actually he is seduced) and then she tells his wife that it was his fault. Is it?  Yes and no.  After all, she seduced him also.  The bottom line, are men pigs or is it just our weakness for women's temptations?  I'll choose number two.

(I can't lay claim to the description by the way. Lay the blame my Wife's way).\tBut as usual she was right. Ford's not necessarily full of it, but he sure looks that way. Harrison Ford spends much of the film looking doleful, unsatisfied, overfed. He's supposed to be heart broken but has been ignored so completely by screenwriter Kurt Luedtke (Out Of Africa, Absence Of Malice) that mind broken would seem to be closer to the mark.Ford plays a Washington cop called Dutch who works in internal investigations. Snazzy sunglasses. An earing. He's a bit of a snappy dresser because his wife (played by Susanna Thompson) works for a fashion house. She heads off suddenly to Miami by aeroplane for her work.Kay Chandler (Kristin Scott Thomas) is a politician who's husband also suddenly leaves suddenly, he says for New York, on business. A plane goes down and the travelling husband and wife are found strapped to adjacent seats under an entirely new hubby and wife name, dead.Kay is up for re-election. It's bad enough that her husband has died but she doesn't want her husband's philandering ways to hit the press.Dutch who was in love with his wife, goes a bit screwball and goes on an investigative binge. He has to know the details of the affair.Dutch and Kay meet. Will a new love blossom? Could these two fall into each other's arms within days of their spouses' untimely deaths?Justifying this, making it believable for the viewers, is a huge dilemma for a filmmaker, even one with the track record of director Sydney Pollack.Pollack directed Out Of Africa, Three Days Of The Condor, Absence Of Malice, The Way We Were, They Shoot Horses Don't They, The Firm and  Tootsie, among others (including the pretty awful Sabrina).Random Hearts works very well indeed for its first third. It sets a cracking pace presenting the far too busy, overstressed, western, urban, lifestyle of the two married couples in a breathtakingly complex and rush about way. No wonder these married people had drifted apart!There's Dutch the cop dealing with a corrupt colleague and Kay the politician marshalling her energies and troops for her  campaign. Television screens, mobile phones, quick commuter flights and particularly voice mail intrude and are used to distraction.The general theme is that of perfidy and treachery, of the lie and its sibling called distrust, taking precedence as the usual means of communication. Is there anyone in this world of police, politicians, husbands and wives who can be trusted?Can these two overcome the loss of their partners and the discovery of the adultery and get on with their lives? And should they be upset about the adultery anyway? One of the characters speaks eloquently in favour of affairs. She'd hate to live without the excitement of illicit romances!Now all of this is interesting enough but what of the execution? Well, I'm afraid that once the plane's gone down, so does the film.It's as though Pollack ran out of airspace with his aircraft. He reduced Dutch to mostly standing about in that Harrison Ford, hair standing on end way even if Kristin Scott Thomas, an English actress, American accent wavering, tried to inject life and brevity into what became an increasingly stolid movie.Scott Thomas (The English Patient, The Horse Whisperer) is an intelligent actress who managed Kay very well indeed and Harrison Ford would have done a lot better with a better script, or at least some more lines. Looking heartbroken for an hour and a half is quite rightly the realm of French actresses, not American leading men.On the plus side, at least Ford's leading lady wasn't improbably younger than him this time, but then for the final insult we were treated to a classic Hollywood, let's tie up all of the loose ends ending.

I had enjoyed the work of Pollack and Ford on Sabrina, a well made film and a careful rewrite of the old material.  On hearing that this film was in production I ordered and read the book.  Immediately it seemed  that this would be a more difficult story to film.   The characters are not always sympathetic,  there is little if any humor and the author makes  numerous plot shortcuts to focus on his principal  theme that, since each would see the other as the  only one sharing the unique combination of loss and betrayal brought on by the air crash, the adulterers' completely surprised spouses would seek each other out.  Moreover, he imagines that resolution could come to both through a bitter exploration of the adulterers' hidden lives and that this experience of thick and thin could yield a deeper love than each had previously.  Although much of the book deals with their bitterness and their building hatred of  their former partners, in the end acceptance and  forgiveness are found.      The film script retains only the air crash and the shared predicament of the spouses. Where the woman is the research aggressor in the book, it is the man  in the film and the woman is never a willing  co-researcher.  The film has a completely new  dramatic sub-plot for Harrison Ford which seems even  more contrived than the double coincidence of the air crash.  The congresswoman up for re-election  sub-plot for the woman is also new, yet it works  better.      Audience the expectations of pure romance or  romantic comedy cannot be met because this story  focusses on a very bitter pill.  Where resolution and  forgiveness is achieved in the book, however, lifting  the burden of bitterness from the reader and  permitting levity, there is no corresponding moment  in the film.  Although forgiveness is never hinted at, we are left to surmise that healing following a  shooting does double duty.  Ford's character need not  be such an unentertaining man of few words and  Scott-Thomas's accent change is a little  disconcerting at first.      This film is not the dead loss suggested by  others.  It is, however, a difficult film to  appreciate because the rewrite and adaptation to the screen is below the standard previously achieved by  the director cast.
