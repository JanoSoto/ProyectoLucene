However, buried every now and then in the list is a comment that claims this film is either ahead of its time or underrated. It is comments such as these that I wish to debunk here.Quite honestly, if this is the future of comedy, then the future of the world is as bleak a place as it was a trend to depict in the Hollywood of 1980 to 1990 or thereabouts. Only it won't be because the economy is in the hole or the police have been given too much power. Like all comedies borne of political correctness, Freddy Got Fingered gives us a glimpse into a future where comedies are made by people who do not have any real sense of humour.Yes, that's right - Tom Green does not have a real sense of humour. You might think a sense of humour entails enjoying laughter, but that is only part of the deal. A real sense of humour entails knowing WHEN to laugh, too. Sure, some events in the film might seem humourous when taken on their own, the gag about a paraplegic woman who likes having her legs beaten with a bamboo stick being an example. However, when combined with spiteful, even hateful events in the film such as one brother claiming a father abuses the younger brother out of sheer malice, that's when it becomes clear that Tom Green is the pathetic kind of idiot who will laugh at anything. He'd probably laugh at a photo of himself being beaten by the LAPD if he were shown said photo under the right circumstances.While Green might feel that every moment he puts in his film hits the mark and he's just misunderstood, thankfully there is still a majority who see him for what he really is. I don't say a majority just to sink into the Might Makes Right defense, either. I say it because I want to assure the people who are as disgusted with this film as I was that the rest of the world is mostly as disgusted as you or I are. Hell, after seeing that tens of millions of dollars was spent on making this trash, I am not surprised that people in poorer countries have it in for America. You'd never see a film that is this much a waste of money being made in England or Australia.So, people, I would like you to remember something. Deriving humour from offense is a trick art, and one that is fraught with danger at the best of times. Everything that Benny Hill made is utterly dated because of how he made this kind of humour work, and even a lot of Eddie Murphy's older material is something you will never see made outside of the early 1980s, chiefly because it walks this line. FGF, on the other hand, is timeless because it goes over the line, stops being even remotely funny, and becomes utterly offensive. Some critics of this opinion claim that the people who were offended have lived a sheltered life. Well, I was abused as a child and I find this film offensive. The reality is that the only people who have lived a sheltered life are those who think this dreck is remotely funny. Not because they haven't seen the reality behind what is presented here, but because they haven't seen it close enough to realise why trying to turn it into comedy is enough to make those of us with our heads screwed on properly sick.This film gets a fat, stinking one out of ten from me. There is a good reason why Tom Green has never knowingly confronted a real victim of child abuse in the street, or gone to disrupt their support groups, during his asinine variety TV show. He is afraid of what the reaction might be. Considering that I've been to support groups for the kind of men whom childhood abuse literally turned into overgrown monsters, I am not in the slightest bit surprised. Ahead of its time?

However, when combined with spiteful, even hateful events in the film such as one brother claiming a father abuses the younger brother out of sheer malice, that's when it becomes clear that Tom Green is the pathetic kind of idiot who will laugh at anything. He'd probably laugh at a photo of himself being beaten by the LAPD if he were shown said photo under the right circumstances.While Green might feel that every moment he puts in his film hits the mark and he's just misunderstood, thankfully there is still a majority who see him for what he really is. I don't say a majority just to sink into the Might Makes Right defense, either. I say it because I want to assure the people who are as disgusted with this film as I was that the rest of the world is mostly as disgusted as you or I are. Hell, after seeing that tens of millions of dollars was spent on making this trash, I am not surprised that people in poorer countries have it in for America. You'd never see a film that is this much a waste of money being made in England or Australia.So, people, I would like you to remember something. Deriving humour from offense is a trick art, and one that is fraught with danger at the best of times. Everything that Benny Hill made is utterly dated because of how he made this kind of humour work, and even a lot of Eddie Murphy's older material is something you will never see made outside of the early 1980s, chiefly because it walks this line. FGF, on the other hand, is timeless because it goes over the line, stops being even remotely funny, and becomes utterly offensive. Some critics of this opinion claim that the people who were offended have lived a sheltered life. Well, I was abused as a child and I find this film offensive. The reality is that the only people who have lived a sheltered life are those who think this dreck is remotely funny. Not because they haven't seen the reality behind what is presented here, but because they haven't seen it close enough to realise why trying to turn it into comedy is enough to make those of us with our heads screwed on properly sick.This film gets a fat, stinking one out of ten from me. There is a good reason why Tom Green has never knowingly confronted a real victim of child abuse in the street, or gone to disrupt their support groups, during his asinine variety TV show. He is afraid of what the reaction might be. Considering that I've been to support groups for the kind of men whom childhood abuse literally turned into overgrown monsters, I am not in the slightest bit surprised. Ahead of its time? More like a product of the most evil socio-political thinking of its time.

The movie was fast, had a quite cliche, but a working storyline, EXCELLENT sets and subtle humour here and there. This definetly ain't a comedy, if that's what you're looking for, but a full-scale oldskool adventure film! The theme music is kickin', and the sets and the whole movie is so colourful, you'd think it was actually made in France (Just watch i.e. Vidocq). It was like experiencing some mid-90's computergame in a movie.I think Eddie did a good job in his role of Pluto Nash, other actors were also high quality, but perhaps a bit shaded by Eddie, not because he acted better, but because of more screen time. I love to see this movie over and over again, everytime I get happy when I've watched it, and everytime I feel like I've seen one of the greatest space-adventures ever.

Ok so maybe he lives in the same house Nancy lived in and lives in the same room Nancy lived in, but that is besides the point. Jesse seems to be a straight student, trying to make average grades in school, and has the major hots for a girl way out of his league, but for some weird reason Lisa actually likes him. Now where does this make sense at all?? Well after they start messing around, Freddy decides he totally wants out of Jesses body right? Come on Freddy, lets get something different here. But I guess at the time whenever this hasn't been tried before in cinema, it was different in all shapes and forms. Freddy goes and totally crashes a swimming party by slicing in way through the crowd to get to some bushes only to turn into flames. Ok why not just walk right through them? I mean, where the hell does he go? He just vanishes. I understand that he is the dream master and everything, but he had to go somewhere. I would imagine that he went off to factory where he killed his little children but who in the hell knows for sure right? Anyways, back to the topic. Jesse and Lisa go running off to where Freddy worked and confront him there only to set ablaze the place and bring the order to Freddy. I seems like Freddy and Jesse are killed only see Freddy is stopped. Well at least for the next five minutes or so. The ending is entirely to cheesy with them driving off into the desert in a school bus. One question though, is Springwood in Ohio? Where in the hell is a desert in Ohio? I am from Pennsylvania and there aren't any deserts there. Whomever wrote this script should have thought of that and not of a weird diabolique scheme inside the movie.
