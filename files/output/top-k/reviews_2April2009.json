On the one hand, the good things I'd heard about the film; on the other, my personal dislike for Mr. Matt Damon. Don't get me wrong - he's a great actor, but there's just something about him that makes me not particularly like him. Obviously, considering the presence of this review, the good things I heard hand won the battle, and luckily for me, it worked in my favor. The film, nominated for five Oscars (including one for Jude Law in a supporting role), was fantastic. The acting overall was phenomenal, especially from Davenport and Philip Seymour Hoffman, who has a small but extremely important role. However, the real credit should go to Damon, who truly delivers one of his better performances in this one. Watching Ripley's transformation over the course of the film is breath-taking, and despite the ramifications the character should be suffering, he always finds a way out of trouble (or he just gets ridiculously lucky). I often found myself wondering aloud how anyone could possibly find their way out of such a sticky situation only to be shown that it is indeed possible with the right amount of skill and luck. The movie's a tad long, but it really never feels that way because it really grabs the viewer and takes you on the journey through happiness and bliss as well as loneliness, anger and utter despair. You feel the emotions that Ripley feels, and the film's ability to do so makes it one of the great ones in my book.

As a fan of the political thriller genre I was intrigued by its premise. Now, having finally found it and had the opportunity to see it I was presently surprised. The film surpassed my expectations and easily ranks amongst the best political thrillers I've seen.The performances are the staring point of this phenomenal film. Frances McDormand gives a marvelous performance as American civil rights activist Ingrid Jessner as Brian Cox as Kerrigan, the top investigator investigating the death of Jessner's boyfriend. The result is that, together and separately, they give two highly watchable performances that keep your attention focused on the screen. There's also the supporting cast including Brad Dourif as the murdered boyfriend, Maurice Ro√´ves as the mysterious army officer Harris who has all the secrets plus Bernard Archard and Patrick Kavanagh as two politicians at the heart of the film's conspiracy.The film is, if nothing else, a conspiracy thriller. What may seem like an odd murder in Northern Ireland soon turns out to be mired in the politics of Thatcher era Britain. The film, while fictional, seems to be far too real for comfort. Writer Jim Allen has crafted a thriller that blends fact and fiction together and so well that the fine line between the two is blurred when it comes to the issues of 1980's Northern Ireland, how Thatcher got herself elected and how governments deal with terrorism. Of even greater surprise is that the plot doesn't overwhelm the dialogue. Unlike some political thrillers, in this film scenes come alive not just from the performances of the actors but from the words on the pages themselves. While it deals with 1980's Northern Ireland one can't help but see the relevant issues ever present in the film nearly twenty years on.On top of the script there's the documentary like approach that makes the film too realistic for comfort. Clive Tickner's cinematography is the main reason this succeeds so well in that it never feels like a Hollywood film. The result is that (thankfully) one gets the feeling of being a fly on the wall for many of the scenes which makes the blurring of fact and fiction even more successful. Add on the realistic costume and production design along with the tight editing of Jonathon Morris and the result is an all too realistic thriller.Hidden Agenda is what a political thriller should be.

I was just reading through some of the message boards about the movies on the IMDb about what peoples' favorite scenes were from part 3 and from the series as a whole, and not one of the scenes mentioned was genuinely funny to me anymore. I remember when I was a kid I loved the movies unconditionally and used to drive my brother insane because I always wanted to watch them, but I can't really remember if I just found the movies fun or if I actually got some good belly laughs out of them. Regardless, the vast majority of the comedy has not dated well, but they are still an amusing romp through the hilarious clothing and comedy styles of the 80s!This time around, Commandant Lassard finds himself in a bit of a moment of crisis as the governor decides that it is no longer financially reasonable to maintain two police academies (the other one headed by the beloved Lieutenant Mauser from part 2), and so one of them will have to be closed. Which academy will be closed depends on performances during a period of observation by an evaluation team. Needless to say, Mauser employs the help of the hilariously idiotic Proctor and the same two goon cadets, Copeland and Blanks, who have been employed by both Mauser and Harris to create problems for our cast of heroes since the first movie. In order to save Lassard's academy, and their own beloved alma mater, from being closed, all of our favorite Police Academy cast members have been brought back from Their First Assignment to become instructors at the academy and ensure that the place looks good.So there you have the setup and the basic plot, and other than that it's essentially exactly the same movie as the first two. The characters are the same, the music's the same, the good guys and bad guys are the same, just the skits are different and this time we have the addition of a few negligible characters, the token geek (Sweetchuck), the token Japanese guy (who really serves no other purpose than to grin like an imbecile and become mesmerized by Callahan's prodigious bosoms), and also the ridiculous additions to the force of Fackler's nutty wife and Tackleberry's nutty brother-in-law. You know, the guy who is always trading punches with his own father. Can you imagine putting a police uniform on such a man? Only in a Police Academy movie!There is not really anything of special note that happens during the movie, although it is a little revealing that this is arguably the funniest installment in the entire series. In keeping with the two preceding movies, we are introduced to the characters in the same way, by glimpsing them in their current lives before the needs of a new movie call them back to the Police Academy world. Hightower is dressing up as an old woman in order to catch purse snatchers in the park, Tackleberry is playing safari in the backyard with his brother-in-law, Fackler is trying to prevent his wife from joining the force (in a scene eerily reminiscent of his first scene in the original movie), and Mahoney is a&#x85;women's basketball coach?Whatever, it doesn't matter what they're doing, their current occupations or pastimes or whatever are just little jokes as they're introduced into the movie. Unfortunately, it's hard to imagine a time when Mahoney's constant flirtations were not as purely creepy as they are now. And that mischievous grin he gets when he's about to play a trick on someone. I need a lot of beers before that's funny, although I would be lying if I said the Police Academies aren't a lot of fun after the beer count enters the double digits. Unfortunately, there is also a definite feeling that in this installment the movie has turned into even more of a series of goofy jokes. Of course, the whole series is a bunch of goofy jokes, but I think that the second sequel is the first time when the characters that we know are used to throw in some moronic sight gags in order to get a cheap laugh, like when Tackleberry pulls out his gun and shoots a payphone because the operator refuses to relinquish her quarter, or Proctor getting locked out in the hallway ass-naked by a prostitute. On the other hand, my beer count was getting up there by this point, so I found both scenes to be pretty funny.It is important to realize that director Jerry Paris developed most of his directing experience on television comedy series, which may have something to do with the, ah, conspicuous lack of subtlety in a lot of the sight gags in Police Academy 2 and 3. It's interesting to consider the impact that his personal directing experience before coming into the Police Academy series may have shaped the series as a whole, which moved in that direction and then never managed to get away from it. Ad now it seems that Steve Guttenberg is attempting to put a Police Academy 8 in motion, in which case I can only hope that he doesn't try to reinvent the series, although I have a feeling that it would take nothing less than a total reinvention to make yet another sequel worthwhile&#x85; ","genre":null},{"date":"2 April 2009","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I gotta admit, ladies and gentlemen, I don't really find this stuff amusing anymore, but for some reason the Police Academy movies are still their own brand of fun.

The characters are the same, the music's the same, the good guys and bad guys are the same, just the skits are different and this time we have the addition of a few negligible characters, the token geek (Sweetchuck), the token Japanese guy (who really serves no other purpose than to grin like an imbecile and become mesmerized by Callahan's prodigious bosoms), and also the ridiculous additions to the force of Fackler's nutty wife and Tackleberry's nutty brother-in-law. You know, the guy who is always trading punches with his own father. Can you imagine putting a police uniform on such a man? Only in a Police Academy movie!There is not really anything of special note that happens during the movie, although it is a little revealing that this is arguably the funniest installment in the entire series. In keeping with the two preceding movies, we are introduced to the characters in the same way, by glimpsing them in their current lives before the needs of a new movie call them back to the Police Academy world. Hightower is dressing up as an old woman in order to catch purse snatchers in the park, Tackleberry is playing safari in the backyard with his brother-in-law, Fackler is trying to prevent his wife from joining the force (in a scene eerily reminiscent of his first scene in the original movie), and Mahoney is a&#x85;women's basketball coach?Whatever, it doesn't matter what they're doing, their current occupations or pastimes or whatever are just little jokes as they're introduced into the movie. Unfortunately, it's hard to imagine a time when Mahoney's constant flirtations were not as purely creepy as they are now. And that mischievous grin he gets when he's about to play a trick on someone. I need a lot of beers before that's funny, although I would be lying if I said the Police Academies aren't a lot of fun after the beer count enters the double digits. Unfortunately, there is also a definite feeling that in this installment the movie has turned into even more of a series of goofy jokes. Of course, the whole series is a bunch of goofy jokes, but I think that the second sequel is the first time when the characters that we know are used to throw in some moronic sight gags in order to get a cheap laugh, like when Tackleberry pulls out his gun and shoots a payphone because the operator refuses to relinquish her quarter, or Proctor getting locked out in the hallway ass-naked by a prostitute. On the other hand, my beer count was getting up there by this point, so I found both scenes to be pretty funny.It is important to realize that director Jerry Paris developed most of his directing experience on television comedy series, which may have something to do with the, ah, conspicuous lack of subtlety in a lot of the sight gags in Police Academy 2 and 3. It's interesting to consider the impact that his personal directing experience before coming into the Police Academy series may have shaped the series as a whole, which moved in that direction and then never managed to get away from it.

I was just reading through some of the message boards about the movies on the IMDb about what peoples' favorite scenes were from part 3 and from the series as a whole, and not one of the scenes mentioned was genuinely funny to me anymore. I remember when I was a kid I loved the movies unconditionally and used to drive my brother insane because I always wanted to watch them, but I can't really remember if I just found the movies fun or if I actually got some good belly laughs out of them. Regardless, the vast majority of the comedy has not dated well, but they are still an amusing romp through the hilarious clothing and comedy styles of the 80s!This time around, Commandant Lassard finds himself in a bit of a moment of crisis as the governor decides that it is no longer financially reasonable to maintain two police academies (the other one headed by the beloved Lieutenant Mauser from part 2), and so one of them will have to be closed. Which academy will be closed depends on performances during a period of observation by an evaluation team.

We are treated to several inventions and gadgets and gizmos, within someone's kitchen and living area, designed to seamlessly ease into one another as the beginnings to a day are kick started. Maybe a television will come on; a robotic arm will pour dog foot into an already over stuffed bowl and toast will pop up when ready, but very burnt. The idea here is that this stuff can work, but to what negative effect? It's quite clear this area hasn't been occupied for a while and the dog food will surely leave a foul smell for when the owner returns but what's that compared to the fire hazards in both the TV and the toast? This is what the film will eventually branch out into; a piece about technology and inventions working but with what, potentially quite terrible, results.Back to the Future is one of those rare and special films that feel tilted more toward a younger audience and yet bear no harm in being revisited by others later on in years. The film can amuse and is able to sustain humour and interest, no matter how wacky the characters are or the predicament is. The film can frighten and additionally pay sly homage to history whilst it includes a fair few gags to how the protagonist's actions perhaps changed the course of history as we know, those being more directed toward the adult watching audience with Marty McFly's rendition of 'Johnny B. Goode' a great example. The film is a near masterpiece, bordering on greatness as it seamlessly entertains, humours, delivers a brilliant and inventive narrative whilst even feeling brave enough to touch on elements of a Freudian nature.Of Marty McFly, he is played by Michael J. Fox in what is a big-screen career defining role. The piece of brilliant technology that is used to a certain degree of negative effect is the time machine a certain Doctor Emmett Brown (Lloyd) built out of a DeLorean automobile. The film revolves around Marty using this invention to travel back to 1955, following an escape from some hostiles out for Emmett, and a consequential accidental changing of history equating in the danger of Marty himself quite possibly being scrubbed out of history.As a stand alone film, Back to the Future offers pretty perfect family entertainment. Its balance of fun and games mixed with a foreboding scenario, a scenario that lies at its very heart, is perfectly captured when McFly wanders down the Hill Valley street in 1955 following going back and witnessing how different his town was thirty years ago before the reality of the situation hits him in ominous fashion. Buried deep within Back to the Future might well be a statement on the condition of then contemporary America. Its two worlds of 1955 and 1985 exhibit the same facilities and general look, but offer very different outlooks on ways of living in the respective years. While porno theatres exist in the 80s, cinemas were playing the cream of Classical Hollywood back in the day; while shops and business' look shoddy, run down and some are even out of business in the modern age but they were clean and bristling with activity in the past.The film even pokes fun at mayoral promises, promising a bright outlook in the 1950s but we, as does the film's lead, know the truth of what becomes of the town. Without obviously pointing fingers, the film shares a joke with us to do with how remarkable it is that Ronald Reagan is the 1985 president. It enjoys telling us that Marty's home estate-to-be will be one of the 'best places to live' come development, but the harsh reality of it is that it's anything but. This is something the second film touches on more when the quality of living deteriorates even more when a powerful political figure (that would be this film's antagonist Biff) has a say in how the town is run, echoing Marty and Emmett's brief but poignant conversation to do with how unbelievable Emmett finds it that Ronald Reagen is the president in 1985.But while the film's political slant isn't its primary focus, you can't help but feel the film is a reference to how the author is very fond of the 1950s or the past in particular, something he sees to have been so much better than the present day. Marty's accidentally and ill advised attempts at changing history result in his teenage mother potentially falling in love with him, subject matter deemed too taboo for Disney and they rejected the film, but the ideas aren't played for sick laughs and the film doesn't linger on the actual notion as much as it does focus on Marty's reactions to all these realisations his would-be mother is having towards him. The 'park' scene in particular acts as an example as to how Marty feels about the situation with the overly dramatic facial expressions acting as an offbeat and drastic reaction to the predicament. It's additionally easy to forget that, by the end, his mother's attention turns more towards George, like history should be, highlighting what a vulnerable girl she is and how easily it is for this girl to fall for someone else at such a delicate time in her life.This factor deflects the idea of the mother falling too deeply in love with her own would-be son somewhat, as we realise how naive she really is to fall again so quickly. But the film is full of ideas and energy, arguably being the best of its 'type' at the time of release.

For a short while Van Damme mattered as something of a big deal in action movies, if only for an occasional sizable paycheck (he pocketed 6 mil for Street Fighter). As an action hero he is reasonably incredible, if that can be a description. Compared to Segal he's certainly the better actor by far, even if at times fairly wooden. He's as hard-working a foreign import as can be imagined and is able to take his role seriously, which is a big boost for the camp factor that can be found in his pictures. His ability is best described as pure physical agility (if you can figure out exactly when and where he has a stunt double I got a cookie for you) with OK acting chops.Which is just fine for a movie like Timecop since its only requirement is that you turn your damn brain off and not think too much about things like, you know, time travel. We all know how convoluted it can get (i.e. Back to the Future) and in the case of Timecop it takes the idea of a government controlled time-travel scenario used as a political ploy by a dastardly senator (Ron Silver delivering the badness as a slimy and snotty politico, not hard to do but fun when in the frame with another Ron Silver), and also a revenge plot, sort of. Sort of in that the character Van Damme plays loses his wife to a huge explosion perpetrated by Silver's character, and then goes back in time to try and correct it, only getting embroiled in other shenanigans like the senator's plot to erase Van Damme altogether.Why a time cop should bother a presidential nominee so much is almost beyond me, but within the context of watching the movie it works as dumb, juicy-cum-meaty pulp. And when it comes time to do the action director\/cinematographer Peter Hyams keeps the controls steady like a basic practitioner of the conventions don't get TOO out of control and it should be violent enough to please Van Damme's kick-boxer fan-base while appealing to sci-fi fans. While as a sci-fi film it has weak points, many weak points, certainly in logic and in the supporting performances (exception being Bruce McGill since, as always, he's just Bruce McGill), it's a decent actioneer that provides a few choice moments of unintentional hilarity (or intentional, it's Sam Raimi producing after all), and with a sturdy lead.Don't expect much, sit back perhaps with a beer after midnight, and it will do its expected numbers job. You could do worse than Timecop, but to say you could also do better is an understatement; Total Recall would probably be the best fit as far as pairing on a double bill with Van Damme specifically going first.

His ability is best described as pure physical agility (if you can figure out exactly when and where he has a stunt double I got a cookie for you) with OK acting chops.Which is just fine for a movie like Timecop since its only requirement is that you turn your damn brain off and not think too much about things like, you know, time travel. We all know how convoluted it can get (i.e. Back to the Future) and in the case of Timecop it takes the idea of a government controlled time-travel scenario used as a political ploy by a dastardly senator (Ron Silver delivering the badness as a slimy and snotty politico, not hard to do but fun when in the frame with another Ron Silver), and also a revenge plot, sort of. Sort of in that the character Van Damme plays loses his wife to a huge explosion perpetrated by Silver's character, and then goes back in time to try and correct it, only getting embroiled in other shenanigans like the senator's plot to erase Van Damme altogether.Why a time cop should bother a presidential nominee so much is almost beyond me, but within the context of watching the movie it works as dumb, juicy-cum-meaty pulp. And when it comes time to do the action director\/cinematographer Peter Hyams keeps the controls steady like a basic practitioner of the conventions don't get TOO out of control and it should be violent enough to please Van Damme's kick-boxer fan-base while appealing to sci-fi fans. While as a sci-fi film it has weak points, many weak points, certainly in logic and in the supporting performances (exception being Bruce McGill since, as always, he's just Bruce McGill), it's a decent actioneer that provides a few choice moments of unintentional hilarity (or intentional, it's Sam Raimi producing after all), and with a sturdy lead.Don't expect much, sit back perhaps with a beer after midnight, and it will do its expected numbers job.

Yet again, such generalizations can never do justice to any genre as a whole, and often simply result in particularly admirable efforts, such as The Thing From Another World being unfairly discarded from the realm of cultural common knowledge. Yet the concept of the film being denied the same sort of plaudits and appreciation other highlights of its era enjoy comes across as nonsensical as well as unfair, as The Thing From Another World manages to work around its criticized genre conventions and deliver one of the most intelligent, sensibly constructed and effectively atmospheric science fiction films, or, debatably, films period of its era.Although Howard Hawks is not credited as director (the billed honour is given to debut director Christian Nyby), the film carries too many overtones of being a Hawks film (fast talking, overlapping dialogue, character complexity and a certain abrasive sense of simultaneous fun and seriousness) for his influence to be discarded. But, regardless of whence the creative input came from, the film stands out as markedly more sensibly put together than the pulpy B-movie its premise could have suggested, turning a simple alien attack into a breathlessly atmospheric study of individuals and groups in an enclosed, isolated area, when beset by an adversary they cannot know or understand. While John Carpenter's critically championed remake The Thing extracted fear through never knowing who to believe or trust by turning his alien into a shape-shifter (remaining closer to John W. Campbell Jr.'s literary source material), its predecessor addresses notions of the unknown through positioning the concept as the outsider - the titular Thing. As such, the film addresses politically poignant notions of the team of good, old fashioned, honest Americans banding together against the unknown Other devoid of morality (suggesting unmistakable communism undertones; whether the film is explicitly anti- communist or satirically poking fun at the Red Scare remains to be seen). Through this approach the film becomes almost more of a war or combat film than a sci-fi thriller, with the Thing being easily substituted by any enemy army attempting to breach the American headquarters being destroyed by an instant, unsettling mechanical proficiency seemingly just as 'devoid of morality' or emotion as the Thing is previously labeled (it is particularly poignant how quickly the team snaps to business, not even stopping to be shocked when confronted with a threat in need of being destroyed). The subsequent thematic contrast between the two groups on the Artic base, the army (who want to destroy the Thing) and the scientists (who want to study it) makes for an uneasy situating of viewer sympathies. Although Kenneth Tobey's Captain Hendry is clearly defined as the film's protagonist, his actions are not always endorsable, and Robert Cornethwaite's chief scientist, roughly situated as an antagonist figure, is mercifully not reduced to a crazed madman figure, but a very calm, sensible man, who, although his actions are continually dismissed, may very well be right. The film also near miraculously defies notions of being dated through its crisp black and white photography offering an uncommonly sophisticated visual aesthetic for its time. Similarly, unlike many of its contemporaries, Nyby and Hawks sensibly avoid showcasing their film's not entirely convincing special effects, often denying the audience expectation of seeing the Thing in all its macabre glory, or filming it in silhouette, or from a distance. Such a technique, echoed by Steven Spielberg in the far more critically recognized Jaws twenty-four years later, not only further situates the character as the unknown by also remaining mostly unseen, but serves as much more frightening and eerie than a man in a rubber suit ever could. The film also serves to address a growing cultural uneasiness against nature and the planet striking back, by having its creature (albeit an alien one) be a sophisticated form of plant life, as if directly representative of 'nature striking back' against the rising capabilities of science. The film's cast also stand out as giving particularly measured and credible performances in contrast to the outlandish melodrama usually heralded by the genre. Kenneth Tobey delivers a masterclass in solid American sensibilities and charm without outright adapting a John Wayne accent, and Margaret Sheridan also suggests Hawks' presence by being an exceptionally strong, quick witted and independent love interest, more than capable of holding her own against the more stoic Tobey. Robert Cornthwaite's measured calm makes his chief scientist all the more fascinating and, crucially, sympathetic and believable, and Douglas Spencer's bone dry wit perfectly makes for a surrogate comic relief figure as a wisecrack dropping reporter, while his seeming out of place feels entirely appropriate given the fish-out-of-water character.It is these uncommonly canny bits of cultural awareness and sophistication (which may or may not be attributable to the Hawks influence) which rise the film several cuts above the caliber of many of its pulpy followers, making The Thing From Another World not just a white-knuckled study in claustrophobia and interpersonal tension, but one of the more sophisticated, atmospheric and poignant films of its era, enough to keep viewers watching the skies for decades to come. -10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 April 2009","score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" There is an inherent tendency to dismiss or discount vintage science fiction movies, with special effects now coming across as dated (despite being cutting edge during their time) and plot and dialogue often ridiculed as cheesy and melodramatic.

His character, doomed to an event that would change the lives of so many others, was rather flat and emotionless despite being placed against death's door. Perhaps that's what the filmmakers wanted, but I just feel like there would be a little bit of emotion when someone reaches that point. Still, although the film is a little clich√© in terms of certain plot devices, it's still a great character drama and worth a watch.

The other half, of course, also involves Berry but not her clothes. However, Monster's Ball definitely offers more than just one fine performance and a rather iconic sex scene. In reality, it's more character-driven than plot-driven. Yes, the storyline helps to shape the characters, but the viewer is supposed to see just how certain circumstances change each individual and the life they live. Thornton, although not at the top of his game, plays a great leading part opposite Berry, and their interaction is wonderful. Heath Ledger's small role in the beginning of the film is good and rather indicative of his makings as a dramatic actor for later in his career.

And this is just one of many genuinely chilling moments in this excellent 80s thriller that go to make it unmissable entertainment for anyone who loves scary movies.The lovely Jill Schoelen plays troubled teen Stephanie, who has every right to be disturbed her father died a year ago, and she suspects that her new stepfather, the seemingly perfect Jerry (O'Quinn), is a serial killer. Of course, Stephanie is right&#x97;Jerry IS a complete nutter desperate to become part of a perfect American family, he marries widows and divorc√©es with children, but kills them when they fail to measure up to his exacting standards.Jim Ogilvie, the brother of one of Jerry's past victims, is hot on the psycho's trail, but with Jerry becoming increasingly disappointed with his new stepdaughter, will Jim catch up with the maniac before another family is slaughtered?Sharply written, with excellent direction from Joseph Ruben, and a brilliant central performance from O'Quinn, The Stepfather rarely puts a foot wrong. At a push, one might argue that Jerry's ability to adopt a new persona after each massacre is a touch too easy, but this is a minor quibble and doesn't affect the power of the film in any way. Schoelen is also superb, offering just the right balance of vulnerability and spunky bravado (plus we get to see her in the shower&#x96;hurrah!).The Stepfather proved to be a minor success on it's original release, and inevitably spawned a sequel, but over the past two decades, it seems to have been forgotten by many (no-one at my place of work seemed to know anything about it). Now that a remake is in the pipeline, perhaps more people will choose to investigate the original; it's a film that certainly deserves to be rediscovered by the masses.

This a kind of wannabe A-list Disney movie with it's attempts at songs, sidekicks and silly romances but it just doesn't quite hit the mark despite James Woods doing a good job with the Hades role. The movie is about the birth of the young boy to Zeus and his wife, his loss of his godly position at the hands of Hades, and his attempt to become a mortal hero to win back his spot with the other Gods at Olympus. His road to hero-dom isn't easy as he's a pretty clumsy goof at first, but he's given a hero trainer voiced by Danny Devito who's kind of a short devil-like character(why he trained hero's I don't know??). He becomes a hero but supposedly still misses the heart necessary to get back to Olympia. This is gained, of course, because he goes googly-eyed over a women who is one of Hades's helpers and does stuff to get her out of his clutches(yeah I know, this doesn't make sense but it's Disney not Shakespeare).

Sure, there are plot holes and some bad choices, but those shouldn't tarnish the overall film.So what's the good? The dialogue for one thing is well written and well delivered. Early exchanges between field equipment expert Eddie and lead Ian Malcolm are snappy and amusing (violence and technology - not good bedfellows! I would have squeezed a little tighter...), while Pete Postlethwaite's character is magnificently arrogant and snide. Even Vince Vaughan, deprived of his usual schtick, is not given short thrift. Part of Spielberg's genius is his eye for situational character beats and his way of dealing with actors. If you notice, almost none of his films short change the characters. Hook, for example, is strongest in it's first half hour, in which we witness Banning's family problems and inability to let go of his work. Notice also Poltergeist. If anyone had any doubts as to the answer to the question of who really directed that film, compare the family scenes with Close Encounters or Jaws. Here too, Spielberg shoe horns in those moments.Aside from the actors, the dinos are still breathtaking four years on. Why are these creatures so awesome and more recent CGI (including Spielberg's own War of the Worlds and Indy 4) are so underwhelming?
