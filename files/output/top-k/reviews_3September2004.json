Gacy, Bundy, etc. My interest in psychology and the human psyche has convinced me to see each of them, good or bad, just to enjoy and embrace the psychological aspects of them. So I found this; Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer... I first found it in my local video\/DVD store a few weeks ago, and thought, hey, it's not that expensive; maybe I should give it a shot. So earlier today, I bought this, The Mangler, and Jackie Brown(each of them being films that I've wanted to see for a while). Not long after reading up on the three films, I quickly found out that this was, most likely, going to be the one that I would enjoy the most. Jackie Brown looks like the typical Tarantino-flick, which can be enjoyable, but is a little too often less than great. The Mangler looks like a cheap, low-budget B-movie, which I also enjoy, but rarely on the same level as a good, psychological movie. So I put this on, sat down, and almost immediately, I realized the genius and talent involved in the film. From one of the very first frames, the film sends a powerful chill down your spine. This film redefined what disturbing can be. The pure level of disturbing, chilling and directly disgusting violence and gore in this film is definitely horrifying in itself. The main character, his actions, his reactions, the very look in his eyes is unsettling and disturbing. Think Hannibal Lecter, but more unpredictable and less, well, annoying, not to mention more terrifying. The cinematography is excellent. I found it terrifying to see the aftermath shots, the slow, developing shots of an inanimate person, while we hear sounds in the background, and suddenly, we realize that the person is dead, and what we're hearing is his or her death. That was quite possibly the best way this could have been handled, as they couldn't, simply because of the budget, show every single killing that was going to be in the movie. The plot is very good; it follows Henry, the serial killer, during a small portion of his life, gives background details, and leaves him pretty much in the same position that it picked him up in, with no direct conclusion. This will probably disappoint some wanting a more in-depth portrayal of Henry's life, and a few who can't accept a movie with no direct, clean-cut ending. I am not sure if I was disappointed with the end; I do not belong to any of the two aforementioned groups, as I saw this mainly for the psychological aspects, rather than a portrayal of Henry's entire life, or a standard Hollywood mainstream piece. Also, as the director, John McNaughton, explains in the interview also on the DVD, they were breaking rules with the film. They didn't want it to be like every other horror movie. The characters are well-written and credible. The acting is great; Michael Rooker is fantastic, very chilling. I doubt I'll ever be able to look directly at a picture of him and not think of his psychotic gaze as Henry. The special effects are very good, for a low-budget late 80's horror film. Actually, when I was watching it, I didn't realize that it was low-budget. None of it seemed like it had been forced down to a lower scale, nothing seemed like it was there in place of what should have been there. It really feels like the director put pretty much everything he wanted in the movie, into the movie. It never felt, for one moment of one scene, that there was a single detail where the director, if you mentioned it to him, would go, yeah, we couldn't really get that to work properly. It's obvious that the director knew exactly what to do, and did it. This proves that he really has talent, not something I would have thought of someone who directed the confused mess that Wild Things was. A great piece of film. The only things that keep this film from a perfect score of ten, is the pace and the various unresolved issues of the film, one of those being the ending(which, admittedly, does leave a bit of a sour taste in the viewers mouth, and leaves him feeling a tiny bit unsatisfied). The pace is somewhat slow, bordering on very slow at times. When the dialog wasn't interesting, and there wasn't anything worthwhile going on on-screen, it tends to be a little boring and dull. The film also does feel a little bit unresolved, as the ending doesn't really conclude anything, but merely marks the ending of the film. I don't know if the director didn't think too much of the importance of a good ending and a conclusion to the story, any conclusion, or he just didn't have any good ideas on how to end it, so he just decided to stop it once the final scene was done, without any actual conclusion to the story. Who knows. Anyway, as I said, these are minor, almost marginal complaints, and don't really take away from the enjoyment of the film, any more than just dragging it down from a ten to an eight. Nothing more. I recommend this excellent, psychological portrayal of a serial killer to just about anyone interested in the subject, who can stand the violence, which, believe me, will shock and disgust many less than hardened individuals... hell, I even found myself, more often than not, having a hard time looking at the screen, something that very few films and film-makers have accomplished. I am what most would define as very hardened, yet I found many scenes more disturbing than I thought was possible. What is interesting is, that while it was hard to look, it was even harder to look away. Henry is the darkness that exists inside every single human being. I give this movie an 8\/10, and I'd like to thank anyone who's had the patience to read this whole thing.

Depressed Howard gets drunk that night with his good friend and UBS News manager Max Schumacher, William Holden.The next night on his news show Howard stuns the TV audience and those in the studio by saying that on his last day as UBS news anchorman he'll end his career in broadcasting by blowing his brains out live on network TV. The rating for Howard's news show hit the roof the next few days. Instead of getting Howard help, who was having a breakdown, the honchos at UBS manager Frank Hackett, Robert Duvell, and program director Diana Christensen, Faye Dunaway, saw a hit in Howard's unstableness and decide to give him a new show The Network News Hour. On the show Howard can act out his visions about what is really happening in the world around us and what can be done to change whats happening for the better of all mankind.

Crazy\/Beautiful discusses many themes that teenage romances won't touch such as safe sex, mental trauma, realistic social differences as well as racial differences without being racist. By that last comment I mean the film looks upon it as a positive difference, this is shown when Nicole compares her skin to Carlos' after sex.Kirsten Dunst surprised me with her acting, I've seen many of her films and I didn't know how she would portray Nicole.

His awkwardness when Nicole is crying after the party is perfect for that scene as it shows the conflict between helping and not helping Nicole.

Released amidst those countless, braindead comedies, Risky Business had shown through them all like a ray of light piercing the darkness, going on to earn rave reviews and rocketed its young star, Tom Cruise, into super-stardom; this was solidified by his role in Top Gun three years later in 1986.Risky Business is a classic example of 80s nostalgia. It's been copied more or less over the years, most notably with this year's The Girl Next Door, but I dismiss those comparisons with a wave of the hand. Little did Cruise know that when he danced around in his underpants in his parent's living room, that he was making one classic scene that has yet to be topped.This is the first film that I really liked Tom Cruise in after viewing his performance in Top Gun. Like that film, Risky Business is a movie that can be seen hundreds of times over and over again and still maintain a drastic hold of your attention until the credits begin to roll.As I look back to 1983 when Risky Business was released, I can't help but wonder just how truly great this movie is. As my one line summary says, Cruise stars as Joel, the good son who's been good too long. When his parents leave him home by himself, he goes on the suggestion of his friend Miles (Curtis Armstrong) to let himself have a little fun while his parents are away. So one night he gets the urge to call up a sexy prostitute named Lana (Rebecca De Mornay) and things soon get risky following their first encounter...I cannot find enough praise for Risky Business, as a lot has already been said about it. What I can say is that even though it was released in '83 (two years before I was born), I can't help but wonder how this movie does kind of mirror today's times and at the same time, capture what life in 1983 must have been like.Movies that sometimes also act as time capsules are amongst some of the best of their kind. Whenever a movie captures the essence, or the atmosphere of a particular era, it's bound to become a classic and be praised in the years following its release for its ingenuity and craftsmanship.P.S Did I also mention that Risky Business is also a wannabe action flick? No, I don't think that I did. This movie does have one brilliant and well-executed car chase between Joel in his dad's Porsche and Guido, the Killer Pimp (played by Joe Pantoliano).10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 September 2004","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" ...And does so to the extreme in Risky Business. 1983 was really only the tip of the iceberg in terms of a storm of raunchy teen-sex romps released throughout the late-70s and early-80s.

When his parents leave him home by himself, he goes on the suggestion of his friend Miles (Curtis Armstrong) to let himself have a little fun while his parents are away. So one night he gets the urge to call up a sexy prostitute named Lana (Rebecca De Mornay) and things soon get risky following their first encounter...I cannot find enough praise for Risky Business, as a lot has already been said about it. What I can say is that even though it was released in '83 (two years before I was born), I can't help but wonder how this movie does kind of mirror today's times and at the same time, capture what life in 1983 must have been like.Movies that sometimes also act as time capsules are amongst some of the best of their kind. Whenever a movie captures the essence, or the atmosphere of a particular era, it's bound to become a classic and be praised in the years following its release for its ingenuity and craftsmanship.P.S Did I also mention that Risky Business is also a wannabe action flick? No, I don't think that I did. This movie does have one brilliant and well-executed car chase between Joel in his dad's Porsche and Guido, the Killer Pimp (played by Joe Pantoliano).10\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"3 September 2004","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" ...And does so to the extreme in Risky Business. 1983 was really only the tip of the iceberg in terms of a storm of raunchy teen-sex romps released throughout the late-70s and early-80s. Released amidst those countless, braindead comedies, Risky Business had shown through them all like a ray of light piercing the darkness, going on to earn rave reviews and rocketed its young star, Tom Cruise, into super-stardom; this was solidified by his role in Top Gun three years later in 1986.Risky Business is a classic example of 80s nostalgia. It's been copied more or less over the years, most notably with this year's The Girl Next Door, but I dismiss those comparisons with a wave of the hand. Little did Cruise know that when he danced around in his underpants in his parent's living room, that he was making one classic scene that has yet to be topped.This is the first film that I really liked Tom Cruise in after viewing his performance in Top Gun.

This one probably has the most gore out of the whole ALien series. The aliens are no longer people in suits they are now CGI monsters which on some levels could turn fans away. After all is done i have to say that i really liked Alien Resurrection. 8\/10  ","genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"3 September 2004","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  I avoided seeing this movie for quite a long time as I generally don't like straight dramas, but was surprised when I finally did see it at how much I enjoyed it. The movie is about a civil war soldier, John Dunbar (Kevin Costner), sent to an outpost in the western frontier. There he encounters an Indian tribe camped a short distance from his outpost. He gradually becomes acquainted with the members of the tribe and, in time, becomes friends with the tribe. What makes this movie so good is being able to see and feel sympathetic to how the indians' land was more or less taken from them by the white man. It was done very cleverly by showing how John Dunbar went from the attitude most people have ( the indians were savages ) to understanding their culture and coming to appreciate it and understanding they were only protecting their way of life and territory. Most of the really good movies, like this one, will have you come away with an altered point of view or, at least, make you look at something in a way you haven't before.

Having lived in the southern US for years, I learned rather quickly that there is a stark distinction between the hillbilly and the American redneck. Hillbillies are more family oriented, while rednecks seem to care more about the toys theyhave and keeping up with Bubba (the southern American version of Keeping Up With the Joneses). Bubba has a rad gun collection; a shiny new truck complete with roll bar, wench and lift kits, mud-flaps and tires large enough to get you out of the mud bog with a truck bed laden with deer carcasses.Frankly, I was amazed at the quality of performance contributed by Mr. Varney. I (as was most of the world) was under the mistaken impression that Ernest was the best this actor had to give. What a grievous error! It is, indeed, unfortunate that Mr. Varney was not to be with us much longer after this attempt. I have missed the Ernest movies, to be honest, but I was also looking forward to another dramatic beneficence from him. This attempt was done with love, executed with a witty tongue-in-cheek delivery, and presented to those who held the series in regard with a more than capable star-studded cast. While the wit was at the expense of a group of people who should be respected for their deep country philosophical ideals and witticisms, so was the series. Frankly, if you didn't like the series, I see no reason to watch and then dog this movie.Cloris Leachman was a joy as Granny. She gave us the same sort of tenacity and spirit as did Irene Ryan. Her performance was delightful in spite of the somewhat small stature of her character.Diedrich Bader's Jethro was cleverly drawn from instinct and heart. Rather than one dumb crack after another, he relied greatly on facial expression as well as physical comedy to entertain his audience; a very wise decision on Bader's behalf considering he is not moron. And as this is his first screen attempt, you will see a strong pattern of characters throughout his career to this point which demonstrates his commitment to perfecting this type of role. Erika Eleniak as Elly May (Playboy model-cum-actress) was the only thing which disappointed me with this production. I believe that she tried and gave her best, but she just wasn't Elly May. I expected to feel that way about Jed or Granny, but not Elly May. Her work here was a bit stiff, in my opinion. I remember that her performance as a Playboy bunny in Under Siege was a little stiff, too. I do not know if her talents as an actress have progressed since this attempt as I've never cared to watch anything else in which she's been featured.Lily Tomlin and Lea Thompson were both dead on their characters. Although Tomlin's character was preconceived and Thompson's was a one-time plot element, they both contributed above-par performances in this work. And, true to the series, there's always some shifty character trying to take the Clampett billion away from Drysdale; enter Rob Schneider. Some critics have stated they did not understand his character's presence in this endeavor, but it fit right in with the theme of the television series. He was entertaining, delivered a good performance, and more importantly...he was funny.Dabney Coleman is Milburn Drysdale in every way, shape and form. He could have been the original participant in the series, as far as I'm concerned. He turned in an impeccable performance here.Although the story line was good, I felt it could have had a little more depth. However, the touching moments between Jed and Elly May appeared to be heart felt and honest, lending a very endearing quality to this production. The most important point I could make here is simply that Jim Varney was (and is) the best thing about this movie. Even if you aren't a fan of his Ernest franchise, you will still enjoy his performance in this movie. This was far superior to his previous performances in any other work.It rates a 6.8\/10 from...the Fiend .
