And so, when Mrs. Muir, who is a widow, falls asleep in the chair of the allegedly haunted house she is renting, we are suspicious, especially when Captain Daniel Gregg makes an appearance. Is the ghost real, or is she just dreaming him?In any event, they get acquainted. And when she finds she is hard pressed for money, she becomes a ghost writer for this ghost, telling his story as a sea captain. When she falls in love with Miles Fairley, the captain decides to take his leave. He tells her while she is asleep that he is only a dream, and that she wrote the book herself. Now, is this a real ghost telling her this, or is she just dreaming that a ghost is telling her he is a dream?Years later, she sits in the chair and falls asleep again, and so once again we wonder if what follows is another (the same?) dream. The scene that does follow is one in which she finds out her daughter Anna is about to be engaged. Anna and Mrs. Muir have a talk in the kitchen, where it turns out that Anna had seen the ghost of Captain Gregg too, when she was a child, and they discuss whether they both saw a real ghost or simply had the same dream.This is followed by another scene many years later, in which Anna writes that her daughter, Little Lucy (Lucy being the same first name as Mrs. Muir), has married a captain (an airplane captain, but you get the idea). Mrs. Muir is tired and decides to take another nap in that same chair. She falls asleep and dies. Or she falls asleep and dreams that she dies. Or she is still in the first dream, and she dreams that she dies. And by now we are completely confused as to what is real and what is a dream.However we interpret this movie, it has a rather paradoxical attitude about marriage. On the one hand, it follows the usual Hollywood line for that period that marriage is essential for happiness. On the other hand, there is an undercurrent throughout the movie that marriage is not conducive to happiness. In the opening scene, Mrs. Muir announces to her mother-in-law and sister-in-law, with whom she is living, that she is going to get her own place and move out, along with her daughter and her maid. Her in-laws object, suggesting that it would be indecent. To this, Mrs. Muir responds, I've never had a life of my own. It's been Edwin's life and yours and Eva's, never my own. Since there is no indication that her husband was a bad man, the implication would seem to be that there is something oppressive about marriage itself, that it involves the sacrifice of one's life for the sake of others.After Mrs. Muir rents the house, Mr. Coombe, the man who brokered the deal for her, comes to visit her intent on proposing marriage, saying that she needs the protection of a man, which is absurd, coming from someone like him, with his high-pitched voice and nervous manner. Captain Gregg is disgusted, referring to him as a herring-gutted swab, and gets rid of him by causing Coombe's car to start rolling away by itself.After Mrs. Muir writes the book, she takes it to a publisher, where she meets Miles Fairley. She falls in love with him. We are suspicious of him, because he is played by George Sanders, who often plays characters who are smarmy and decadent. She intends to marry him, but it turns out that he is already married with children. Worse yet, his wife knows that Fairley does that sort of thing to women on a regular basis, and it seems to be no big deal to her.In a subsequent scene, however, Mrs. Muir tells Anna she saw Fairley years later at a dinner party, where he cried because his wife had finally had enough and left him. She also mentions that he was bald and fat. But if Fairley had turned out to be a decent man, and had married Mrs. Muir, he would still have become bald and fat, because that happens in a marriage, even a good one.When the old man carves Anna's name into a post on the shore, he tells her it will be there forever and a day. And yet, as the years pass, we see it slowly rot away and fall over. Is this not a metaphor for marriage, which begins with the illusion that love will last forever, only for it to slowly decay and fall apart?Now, we know that the idea is that for a woman to be happy, she must marry the right man, and the right man in this case is Captain Gregg. And so, at the end of the movie, when she dies, and she and Captain Gregg are together again, apparently forever, we know that she is finally happy. And she and Gregg both have their good-looking, youthful appearance, forever apparently. In other words, Gregg will never become bald and fat.The three real men in Mrs. Muir's life, her husband Edwin, Mr. Coombe, and Miles Fairley, were not suitable for her for different reasons, and only a dream-ghost was the right man. The message seems to be that a truly happy marriage is itself a dream, and that in real life, one is better off remaining single. As Mrs. Muir says to her daughter, You can be much more alone with other people than you are by yourself, even if it's people you love.

For me personally, it's a very good film, but there are some things that drag it down (pun possibly intended).What's the cauliflower? The film follows the passengers and crew of the SS Poseidon, sailing through the Mediterranean on its final voyage before decommissioning. On New Year's Eve the ship is at full sail, but in order to meet schedule the representative of the Shipping Line insists that the ship continues on course without taking on ballast, to the unsuccessful protest of the Captain. As night falls the passengers gather in the ballroom for their New Year's Party, but reports come in of an undersea earthquake that has triggered a massive Tsunami, which strikes the ship causing it to capsize because it's too top-heavy, leaving the entire vessel floating but upside down. The film follows a handful of survivors as they attempt to make their way to the thinnest part of the ship's hull in the hope that they can be rescued, dodging death on their slowly sinking vessel every step of the way!To me, the film is very very good at building the tension, the fact that these people are trapped inside a giant metal coffin with no way out. They have no idea whether going to their destination will result in the rescue, but that thin slither of hope keeps them going through all odds, and that's what keeps you gripped. You want to see these people escape, and you find it genuinely tragic when many of them die, some more suddenly than others.I do however have some peeves. One is the whole idea of the ship being stuck upside down like that. I somehow get the feeling that the vessel would still sink, with what air is trapped in the hull just finding a weakness and bursting through to let more water in. But that's technical shipbuilding babble that nags me.The other problem is that some of the acting does get a little corny at times, with some of the performances going a little over-the-top. Indeed a romantic relationship between two of the characters is a bit hard to comprehend as well, and ultimately leads to nothing.But other than that, the rest of the film is a very intense, very gripping thriller about escaping what can be some people's interpretation of hell. The sets and locations built to replicate the inner workings of the vessel are done perfectly, making you truly believe that you're actually in the bowels of an upturned ship. The action scenes are also quite poignant, keeping you on the edge of your seat as they dodge death at every turn, from boiling vats of water, to bursting bulkheads and collapsing pieces of the ship's interior.On the whole, as a survival thriller movie I'd say definitely give it a watch!

Indeed there are a lot of implausible moments, and after the destruction of the World Trade Center you can't help but make comparisons, but other than that it's a solid action movie.So what's the barbecue? We find ourselves in San Francisco, and it's the opening night of the Glass Tower, the world's tallest skyscraper at a height of 138 stories. As guests arrive, the architect, Doug Roberts, has doubts that the cheaply made electric system will be able to hold the intended light show, but his worries are sidelined so as not to rock the boat. Sure enough a fire does start and very soon the building is engulfed in flames, trapping hundreds of people at the top-floor restaurant.Now, the bad things.

My personal favourite moment is when Steve McQueen's character goes up in the elevator to inform the building's owner that the fire is out of control, whilst on the way he takes off his fireman's jacket and helmet so as not to cause a panic, which I found was a great touch because it shows he's a thinking and concerned Fire Chief, trying to maintain calm in such a difficult and dark situation.Overall, aside from some of the physical problems of implausibility with regard to some of the scenes, this is a very good, very entertaining action movie. Indeed the story isn't complex, simply just put out the fire without getting yourself killed, but it's the fact that it takes the time to give it a bit more a human touch than some of the other disaster movies of the time.

The 1980s were a decade of goofy gimmick movies, and Gremlins offers exactly that.While scouring Chinatown to sell one of his many inventions, Randall Peltzer (Hoyt Axton) is introduced to a cute, furry critter called a Mogwai. He names it Gizmo and brings it home as a pet for his son Billy (Zach Galligan). Gizmo requires special handling no bright light, no water, and no feeding after midnight. After getting wet, Gizmo produces replicant Mogwai. This could really be the big one, Randall says happily. He is soon proved tragically correct.When it was released in the summer of 1984, Gremlins was a marvel of cinematic wizardry on account of the animatronic puppets that make up the title characters. Much of the talk around the film centered on a sequence in the Peltzer kitchen where Billy's mother (Frances Lee McCain) has to fend off various attacks from the nasty gremlins, and in doing so contributed to the creation of a new MPAA- rating, PG-13.It's a brilliant sequence, the one moment in the film where the special effects (designed by future Oscar winner Chris Walas), the story (by Chris Columbus) and a human performance deliver on the payoff Gremlins promises. McCain is so intense yet so funny you can get as much from watching her face as you do from the carnage on the countertops around her. It's one of the great moments of 1980s cinema.The rest of the time, Gremlins is a tonally imbalanced, under- funny concept film that doesn't do much more than flog merchandise in the guise of a story. Conceived as a straight horror film, Gremlins went through various changes after producer Stephen Spielberg took hold of the project, so that when it finally was released, it became a scare comedy without the jokes.Entire plot lines were dropped, but the film is so ineptly constructed that their beginnings remain. We are introduced to Billy's interest in comics, a local pub under threat of condemnation, a poor mother trying to find a way to feed her children for Christmas, an obnoxious co-worker of Billy's played by Judge Reinhold, and other things, all of which vanish when the gremlins take over the second half.

After getting wet, Gizmo produces replicant Mogwai. This could really be the big one, Randall says happily.

First we have new comer James Caan, groomed in true Hollywood fashion as a clone of Marlon Brando who by this time was upgrading his image with more sophisticated roles (I mean how many times can you play the delinquent or pug?) Caan would later do the same thing within that other acclaimed cinematic dirge The Godfather (Yes I know, a fav' of many and I will take flack for this, but really...?) in there with him would also be Marlon, with a mouth full of marbles, mumbling his way through to over-rated raves.

Out on its maiden voyage, the Cruise Ship Argonautica and its passengers celebrate with an evening party, only for the vessel to be abruptly plunged into darkness. Meanwhile, a Captain named Finnegan, who's piloting a boat with a compliment of Mercenaries, is taken captive by them, revealing themselves to be in actuality Pirates who intend to rob the Argonautica of all its riches and sink it. Upon reaching the blacked out liner, they discover all but a handful of people have been killed by an unforeseen tentacled creature, that's infested the ship's ventilation system and can strike without warning. What follows is a desperate fight to survive about the stricken vessel, whilst also partaking in a clumsy collection of stupid plots and conflicting story lines that make you more and more confused.Okay, what's so bad about this film? The acting for starters, which is very cheesy and over the top. I would like to think that this is similar to Tremors in that it's a satire of what people would act like in such a horrific situation, but this is meant to be taken seriously, and with these performances... no.Next, the CGI, which is so laughably poor and fake looking you'd think it was just hashed together in 20 minutes on Flash Studio. It's pixelated, the creatures never look convincing, and it really is very dated.Next up, the story, which, as mentioned, is very confusing. If it was simply just a basic plot about a rescue ship sent out to find a stricken cruise liner, only to come across a vessel filled with horrible monsters, that would make for a gripping adventure\/horror story. Instead, we have pirates, crossed with an insurance scandal, crossed with another thief who's already on the ship, crossed with implausible attempts to resolve the problem, and with the movie ending on probably the lowest point you could. I won't give it away but it really is undeniably stupid.So, to sum up, this movie is very, very bad, in more ways than one. The CGI is bad, the story is bad, the acting is bad, aside from a few jump-scares it's not that frightening, and when you do finally get to see the monster, you never thought you'd be laughing at the end of this movie! I certainly was, it was really bad!

And they were good.Okay, so you'll probably have to be okay with gangster films in general, not to mention plenty of foul language, unlikeable characters, excessive violence and probably some more bad language. If you can overlook all of those then you'll probably enjoy Lock Stock.They say that the simple ideas are the best and normally they're right. However, Lock Stock is anything but simple. Yes, the story is primarily about four lads who get in deep debt with a particularly unsavoury character, but that's only a small portion of it. There are numerous characters, each with their individual story lines. It just so happens that all of these story lines are somehow relevant to the central story and they all come together perfectly (and possibly violently). Along with the violence, language and nasties, you have to be prepared to concentrate.

Though I am 82 years removed from that time and culture I still laughed quite a bit at the craziness going on. There is something about this era of comedy movies that I really like and the comedians like Abbot and Costello, Laurel and Hardy, Charlie Chaplin, The Marx Bros., and my favorite The Three Stooges. These guys were the pioneers of the jokes and slapstick in the early days of film that would eventually become cliché; however in their time it was cutting edge and original.Someone else said that if somebody turned out movies like this in the '90's it wouldn't be funny or sell. Of course it wouldn't be funny because it would have been comedians of the 90's doing cliché acts. Sometimes there are moments in history where all the factors are only applicable to that exact time period and they would not work in another era if debuted for the first time e.g. silent films being made today exactly as they were in the 19-teens or 20's will not be your biggest seller at the theater. But the generations of the future can look at the past and respect the work that was done because it paved the way for the efforts put forth in modern times. Comedy of the 90's (or any decade) that will stand the test of time will be that which is original and clever. Ghostbusters or Goonies of the 80's is an example of original material of that decade still popular today. So in the same vein Duck Soup is a classic of the 30's, but not only that, it is a classic comedy in the annals of film history.The Marx Brothers just mesh really well together and the lines that are delivered were just hilarious, like when Groucho says, You know you haven't stopped talking since you got here. You must have been vaccinated with a phonograph needle. Harpo just did some weird stuff and it seemed absolutely random, like using scissors on everything. There was some quick wit coming from these guys that just worked well. All of the random acts that would happen just kept you guessing and wondering what is going to happen next. This kept the movie unpredictable in some areas. Some jokes were predictable, but that is because they have been used so many times since then.I wonder what it would be like to see this for the first time in the theater in 1933. It probably would have been far funnier to me. I think this will be one of my new favorite classic comedy films. If you have a little over an hour to spare, I highly recommend just sitting down and watching this funny piece of history.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"31 March 2015","score":"","review":" Based on a Robert Maugham novella from 1948, and adapted by Harold Pinter with the American ex-pat Joseph Losey directing, The Servant is on BFI's Top 100 British Film list. It is also on Cahiers du Cinema's Top Ten list for 1964 (although it premiered here in the US one week or so before the JFK assassination). So with such a rather distinguished pedigree I was curious and decided to check it out.Since we're talking about a film over a half century old, let's get some context out of the way. I myself am 56 years old, and I get the whole crumbling class distinctions that was so revolutionary and trenchant for the time. Ditto on the sexual tides churning and turning right before the whole Mod Carnaby St. trend hit two years later. So even before the movie started, I was ready to give this independent film some props for being prescient and taking on adult issues of social import. I soon discovered that the cinematography is great, and Losey's direction is very dynamic even given the mostly claustrophobic surroundings.The only problem is there is not one likable character in this movie. They are all grotesque in one way or another, like Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio. Tony (James Fox) is an effete upper class twit, Hugo Barrett, the titular servant played by Dirk Bogarde, is a smoldering cauldron of class resentment and spiteful subterranean shenanigans, Susan (Wendy Craig), is Tony's bitchy and frigid girlfriend, Vera (Susan Miles), is a two-faced slut, etc. You get the idea.Granted the plot line was ripe with possibilities (you surely know what it is by now if you've read this far down the thread), but the execution here is wanting. The characters, being so grotesque, aren't very believable. Nicholas Roeg would take the same basic idea and do it much better with Performance a few years later, and that film has aged a lot better in my humble opinion.So what if this film was all the rage in 1963; here in 2015, it's just a dreary pretentious bore. It looks great, the performances are substantive, but the themes have been done to death and The Servant no longer surprises and just doesn't carry that much dramatic weight anymore. There are literally dozens of films that are much older than this that I find exciting to watch again, but I'll never bother torturing myself with this dated dinosaur.But if you're a British art house stuff completest, by all means, check it out; it is an historically important film in that regard.

I'm not a gore fanatic at all and I appreciate subtlety but the film is not remotely frightening and for a haunted house setting with the additional use of black and white, it is not even particularly atmospheric.I keep reading people going on about how terrifying the noises and the turning of the door knob were. To me, this was barely even suspenseful. There is honestly so little of the supernatural within the entire film that I'd hesitate to even describe it as a horror film. Most of the very little tension in the film involves Eleanor fighting with Theodora.Speaking of which, Julie Harris's character who is the protagonist of this film is irritating, boring and not remotely likable. In fact, the rest of the cast is very underwhelming with the possible except of Theodora who has maybe a little more personality than the rest.Despite all this and how disappointed I am with this film, I still can't quite bring myself to give it one star. There is a slight charm to it although I think this owes more to the time period that the film was set in than anything else.I'm writing this in bed at 156am and am totally confident that I could go to sleep right now without feeling any fear whatsoever.
