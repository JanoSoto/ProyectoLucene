Most cinema fans already know about this film or have at least heard of it. No doubt its one of the most famous and influential science fiction films of all time not to mention one of the most unique due to its unconventional storytelling, use of classical music in space scenes, realism in space travel and groundbreaking special effects that still hold up very well. Yet despite all that when I first watched this movie when I was in my early teens I hated it mostly because I was expecting something similar to Star Wars. Instead what I got was a slow moving art house science fiction film with hardly any dialog and mostly visuals with little to no action. As I've gotten older I've come to appreciate this fascinating film since my taste in movies has changed a lot since I was a kid.If there was any way to describe this movie it would have to be a journey of evolution. Think about it. When you watch this film you're simply watching the evolution of humans into the people we are today and beyond. In the beginning of the film primitive human ancestors discover an alien object called the Monolith which causes them to evolve to a point where they can make the first weapon and kill in order to survive. In a famous flash cut from the simple bone to a complex satellite millions of years later we have evolved to a point where we can leave Earth and explore outer space and the moon. Computers have also evolved into complex AI's that can feel most notably HAL 9000. The rest of the film focuses on the journey into the unknown which we nor our main character can comprehend. Science fiction has always been used as an allegory for the human condition. Where do we come from? Where are we going? What will we encounter when we get there? are questions that 2001 asks us but leaves open to interpretation by the time that the movie is finished.For its time the special effects were groundbreaking in that it gave us a realistic view of what space travel might look like.(This was before Neil Armstrong landed on the moon.) Not to mention the famous Stargate sequence that is a beautiful but creepy sequence of colors and scenery. Music was also used to great effect to represent the serenity and calmness of traveling through space or the creepy and scariness of the unknown. As for acting its good but the standout is Douglas Rain as HAL 9000 who gives him a creepy tone of voice that matches perfectly with the red electronic eye making him one of the most iconic science fiction movie characters of all time.As I said before this is a slow movie and there is very little dialog so unless you are into science fiction films about the philosophical and the journey into the unknown you might be bored due to the lack of action.

I grew up with Travolta on Welcome Back Kotter, and I was not impressed. A number of movies went by, and I saw a few...and became cautiously optimistic that maybe he was at least an okay actor. But with a few films right around 1996, including this one, he won me over. No, he's no Laurence Olivier, but he's a very pleasant and often very interesting actor. This may be his best role, although you don't realize it until well into the movie when he begins to have a sort of breakdown, and you see the transformation of the character he plays.The story is a good one...a man she some flashes of light in the sky and suddenly becomes brilliant, learns things remarkably fast, develops complex and original ideas, etc. Of course, the government gets involved, and eventually -- when they realize he will soon die -- they want to do open brain surgery to learn as much as they can. Will they succeed? Meanwhile, throughout the film he is trying to win the heart of Kyra Sedgwick...who's a hold out of sorts...the rest of the town loves him...until his weirdness begins to freak them out.Personally, I'm not a fan of Kyra Sedgwick, and I wouldn't have cast her in this role...although she does okay. Similarly, I wouldn't have chosen Forest Whitaker as the role of best friend. Robert Duvall is another actor I never cared for...but, it has been re-looking at roles like this that have led to me reconsidering the quality of his acting, and I have to admit I was wrong...he was and is a terrific actor, and demonstrates that again here. It was nice to see Richard Kiley as the brain specialist here, not that his character is one you are apt to like.

Unlike her more genteel family and friends, who either lose everything or in one tragic case - her father - lose their sanity, she holds it together against forces she doesn't really understand and does whatever she has to do to beat the Yankees at their own game. But through it all she just can't get that unrequited obsession with Ashley out of her head, and that is more her personal undoing than anything the War did or ever could have done.This film is a demonstration of the best the studio system could do in that fabled year of 1939, and it showed that the studios had finally got putting together a costume drama that conveys true raw human emotions and reactions and even eroticism without crossing that pesky production code line.

We have the hard-luck, embittered wanderer, Fred Dobbs, Dobsy, the grizzled, veteran prospector, Howard, and the youngest of the trio, the decent, callow Bob Curtin. Joining forces, they share a commonality of purpose they all lust to find that one big strike that will give them the riches to set them up for life. Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston and Tim Holt play these three itinerants, making for a powerful ensemble of talent whose performances bring a timeless relevance to this story of human greed, and redemption. With these elements the film could have easily been just another preachy sermon with cardboard characters representing good and evil. But here&#x85; not so. The acting is superb, the script is intelligent and vivid. John Huston's direction shows that he understood the motivational complexities at play in these three men; he knew what these men were about and was able to transfer that admirably to the movie screen.

A lot of times, I just can't get into art-house types of movies and this is one I just couldn't get into. The plot is just flat and hardly anything to it, but it's still about a hour and a half long since it moves along so slowly. Despite the weird and surreal imagery and characters I was bored with this one. With the constant eerie space noises in the background. Which is in some art-house films, maybe to bring out the feeling of chaos. The protagonist Henry seems like a nice guy who is just out of it and confused most of the way through. And he actually adds to the surrounding and made me understand what might be going on a bit more. I don't know maybe I just missed out on a lot of the symbolism or something. Or maybe some people that praise this film are just self-indulgent and pretentious to the point of liking this film(or acting like they like it). Maybe it is a brilliant film, but personally I just didn't enjoy it much. It felt way too slow for my taste and I started to run out of patience. It does seem to pick up after the first hour though.

I kind of suspect these people are the same geniuses who leveled the same criticism at Batman, so I will run the following question by you all suppose that you had some kind of trait that made you extremely different from the rest of the populace. Would you be running around in multicolored spandex, parading around like a hero, or would you be having deep crises about how you react to other people's fear. As a sufferer of a present-day equivalent of the mutations shown in this film, I know what my answer is.The modification of the story to show Rogue as a young woman who has only just discovered that everyone she touches is severely wounded by it was a master stroke. Not only was it great to see how human the mutants really are (more so than the minorities in this film, as a matter of fact), but casting a delicate, intelligent young woman like Anna Paquin in the role was a perfect capitalization on the writing. Coupling this with the way Wolverine is shown as the result of a horrid military experiment who is now just trying to survive as best he can was a brilliant idea, too. Hugh Jackman was a perfect choice for the role. As a man whose past combines pieces of these two characters' histories in a more figurative sense, I found these two actors utterly believable in all respects.The only thing wrong with the movie, in my view, is that the think tank which made these excellent moves with the good guys ran out of steam when the bad guys were written. Mystique, Toad, and Sabre tooth just don't have the same level of character development allocated to them as Wolverine, Rogue, Cyclops, and Storm. Mystique gets one line in the whole film (the rest are her pretending to be someone else), and Toad is merely there to provide excuses for gratuitous special effects shots. Capping that off is the fact that Magneto is shown as a survivor of the holocaust who takes on the same kind of attitude as the Nazis. Granted, he is being somewhat provoked by the section of humanity that is afraid of mutants, but once again my experience as part of a small percentile of the populace that has had outright lies told about it by the rest tells me that more motivation would have been required for Magneto to become so like his real enemy.Aside from the uneven development of the characters, however, this is another near-great modern adaptation of a comic book.

Everyone called it Disney's Folly. And yet, it was a giant money maker, grossing over $8 million, established its creator as a master filmmaker, and created a genre, changing history forever. Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Toy Story, and Finding Nemo all owe to this movie Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.Released in 1937 and re-released in 1944, 1952, 1958, 1967, 1975, 1983, 1987 (50th anniversary), and 1993, Snow White has charmed audiences for decades. But is it the classic everyone hails it as? Yes, it is. Snow White stands out as one of the best films in the Disney canon. We all know the story, so I'm not going to write it all out, just use IMDb's synopsis Snow White, pursued by a jealous queen, hides with the Dwarfs; the queen feeds her a poison apple, but Prince Charming awakens her with a kiss.The animation in the film is gorgeous, even by today's standard (save the Huntsman and the Prince, they look somewhat odd). Snow White genuinely looks like a young girl, and the Queen looks like a real woman. The way the Dwarfs are drawn is enjoyable, and so are the characters. Snow White is kind, cheerful, good with animals, and has a good personality (not to mention the fact she became a mother to the Seven Dwarfs - a tough job). The Dwarfs are all memorable and lovable, with Grumpy and Dopey being the most liked. The Queen is a great villain. Her drive to kill a young girl so she can be the most beautiful, which makes her go insane is incredibly disturbing and creepy, and the way she looks as the Witch is great. The film's music and songs are also perfect and memorable, with Heigh-ho and Someday my Prince will Come as the standouts. This is also perfectly paced, with sweet moments, scary moments, and time for character development.So, what else can I say? Gorgeous animation, memorable characters, perfect music, and a brilliantly constructed plot. A true cinematic masterpiece not to be missed.

And yet, it was a giant money maker, grossing over $8 million, established its creator as a master filmmaker, and created a genre, changing history forever. Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Toy Story, and Finding Nemo all owe to this movie Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.Released in 1937 and re-released in 1944, 1952, 1958, 1967, 1975, 1983, 1987 (50th anniversary), and 1993, Snow White has charmed audiences for decades. But is it the classic everyone hails it as? Yes, it is. Snow White stands out as one of the best films in the Disney canon. We all know the story, so I'm not going to write it all out, just use IMDb's synopsis Snow White, pursued by a jealous queen, hides with the Dwarfs; the queen feeds her a poison apple, but Prince Charming awakens her with a kiss.The animation in the film is gorgeous, even by today's standard (save the Huntsman and the Prince, they look somewhat odd). Snow White genuinely looks like a young girl, and the Queen looks like a real woman. The way the Dwarfs are drawn is enjoyable, and so are the characters. Snow White is kind, cheerful, good with animals, and has a good personality (not to mention the fact she became a mother to the Seven Dwarfs - a tough job). The Dwarfs are all memorable and lovable, with Grumpy and Dopey being the most liked. The Queen is a great villain. Her drive to kill a young girl so she can be the most beautiful, which makes her go insane is incredibly disturbing and creepy, and the way she looks as the Witch is great. The film's music and songs are also perfect and memorable, with Heigh-ho and Someday my Prince will Come as the standouts. This is also perfectly paced, with sweet moments, scary moments, and time for character development.So, what else can I say?

And I realise now what all the fuss is about. The script is fantastic. And the acting is perfectly judged. The film has so many things going for it. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are superb, and they just gel so well on screen. Their gang of friends is lewd and crude but very affectionate and best of all, they swear authentically and talk in native accents. Robin Williams is a strong character as usual but most of the time is quite restrained, and acts well off other characters. Stellan Skarsgaard is perfectly convincing as a wily mathematics professor who is an old friend and rival of Williams' character. Minnie Driver acts well and has some great scenes, but I think her character is too much of the love interest -- it's a pity. The plot hums along nicely and, all in all, it's a satisfying movie.
