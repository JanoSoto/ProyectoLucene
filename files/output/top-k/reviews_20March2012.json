It was shot on numerous locations in the Vaucluse department of Provence in the southeast of France and is part of a duo logy which was preceded by Jean De Florette (1986). It tells the story about Manon Cadoret who still lives in the highlands of Provence ten years after her and her mother Aimeé had to sell their property to Cesar Le Papet Soubeyran and his nephew Ugolin Soubeyran. Manon has become a shepherd girl and lives a quiet life, but when she one summer day encounters Ugolin who now is a successful farmer, bad memories are awakened. Struck by the now grown up Manon who he has not seen since she was a little girl, Ugolin falls head over heels in love with her. But Manon still remembers what he and his uncle did to her family, and she has found a way to reveal their secret.Like the first part of this epic story, this continuation is subtly and acutely directed by French filmmaker Claude Berri (1934-2009) and with it's ardent milieu depictions and efficient narrative structure, it draws an incessantly engaging portrayal of a young French woman who has been waiting several years to get justice for what happened to her family a decade earlier in time. This reverent sequel from the mid-1980s, produced by French producers Pierre Grunstein and Alain Poiré (1917-2000), is a co-production between France, Italy and Switzerland and has a powerful score by French composer Jean-Claude Petit, based on Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi's Italian opera The Force of Destiny (1862), which reinforces the film's atmosphere.Notable for it's wonderful production design by production designer Bernard Vézat and cinematography by French director and cinematographer Bruno Nuytten which is as present here as in the first segment, this historical period drama becomes an in-depth study of character that examines themes such as family relations, faith, morality and love, and is impelled by Yves Montand, Emmanuelle Béart and Daniel Auteuil's compassionate acting performances. A memorable, moving and humane film which gained, among other awards, the César Award for best supporting actress Emmanuelle Béart at the 13th César Awards in 1987 and the KCFCC Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the Kansas City Film Critics Circle Awards in 1988.

Despite the wave of sub-par products produced by him in the early-mid 1990s, his works during the 80s showcase his unique capabilities to produce solid animated films that focused on dark elements and have been able to capture to hearts of children who watched the film. An American Tail can be described as a light-heart view of America back in the late 19th century and the result is a satisfying journey that kids will remember years from now.When I was a young child, I remember watching the sequel a few times and really enjoying it. I hadn't even heard of this movie until Summer, 2005 when my grandparents from Odessa got a tape. Having seen it then left a good impression on me and really made the film valuable. It was not until almost six years later when I could finally get my hands on it and it's certainly is something I feel was worth every penny.The story is about Fievel Mousekewitz, an seven-year old Jewish-Russian mice who immigrate to America with his parents and two siblings to America. While on a ship, Fievel gets loss in a storm, causing a separation between his family and must find a way to return to his family.The scores is fantastic to say the least as they do very well to match up with the scenes. It does a commendable job of drawing you in to the scenes and help focus the story; not to mention is very pleasant to listen to. Mood during the story is also helped very well with the music as depressing moments are more efficient with relatively sorrowful music and more upbeat musics accompany the more light tone scenes. I especially loved the first OST, which gave the movie somewhat of a mystical aspect. The songs are more of a mixed bag. Somewhere Out There is, to say the least, a brilliant piece of music and has a very strong meaning; that somewhere out there, someone is there for you, but the rest of the offering aren't really that great. No Cats in America, A Duo, and Never Say Never, while not bad, are pretty forgettable and feel pretty forced in just for the sake of more music and could have been forgo.Don Bluth style of animation is unique, but unique isn't always great and Don Bluth's style really isn't that good. The film looks as if it came from a 70s animation movie (quality-wise) and doesn't look all that appealing. Perhaps people weren't too bothered by the animation back in the 80s, but now that twenty-five years has passed, it has aged poorly and while can be overlooked by casual viewing, can be noticed quickly by more critical analysis.I honestly think that the baby shouldn't have appeared in the movie at all. It is barely shown (I can only recall two scenes where it is even visible) and has no relevance to the story. The villain of the story also strikes me as generic and doesn't really do much outside of a typical villain. Fortunately, most of the rest of the characters are great. The family really has a strong bond between each other and shows more love than most families do nowadays with the determinations they go to find Fievel after finding out that Fievel was alive. The tie-in they make to Tanya and Fievel does a great job of showing sibling love between each other and their determination to reunite, not to mention that the affection the parents gave to their children is believable and establishes connection between them very well; especially between Papa and Fievel. Fievel, however, is the best character in the movie. Bluth did a commendable job on making Fievel believable by showing the innocence of a young child, yet balancing it out well with Fievel's determination to find solution and to help others. The scene during the storm and near the end of the movie can make a person sob because of the struggles Fievel goes towards reuniting with his family. It's no wonder why Fievel is my current avatar on the site.What makes the film ultimately a successful film is that it has a strong, consistent story. It does a very good job at having the audience care about the characters in the story and what happens to them. Fortunately, the story doesn't sway to sub-plots after sub-plots and focuses on the main plot of the story. Sub-plots that were made; however, actually related to the story and added more depth to it. The story has a very deep meaning to it as it emphasize the value of family and never giving up to reach your goals. What is also a plus is that it is engaging and had good pacing that kept the film from dragging out too long while not feeling rushed. Finally, the film treats kids as if they are older then they are and doesn't dumb down it's message just to be appropriate.Overall, the film succeeds at what it does and has raw emotion to it that makes it a strong experience. The scores is wonderful with an mystic feeling to it, Somewhere Out There is a beautiful song that capture the hearts of many, the characters are mostly likable and can relate to people in real life in some ways (especially Fievel), and it has a strong, consistent story. Despite a few exception to the rather strong story, the other songs that are forgettable, and the ugly animation, it has a lot of heart to it and this sadly forgotten film deserves more recognition than it has receive in the present day.Final Score 7.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 March 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" There's something unique to Don Bluth when it comes to animated movie.

Everything in the film hinged on this mysterious steel suitcase that scores of people ended up getting killed in trying to get their hands on it. It was American mercenary Mr.Sam, Robert De Niro, who was hired together with a number of unsavory characters by Irish Republican Army operative Deindne, Natascha McElhone, to retrieve this suitcase in an arms deal set up in Paris. This lead to a shootout when the deal went bad and the person who was supposed to make the switch, the guns for the money, and his bodyguards ended up shot to death.From then on out things got worse as the movie went or zipped along with a number of spectacular car chases and shoot-outs in the French cities of Nice Aries and Paris with Mr.Sam getting clipped and coming back to life by preforming a delicate operation on himself, in getting the slug out of his side, without the help of anesthesia or a blood transfusion. Only to get shot again in the films confusing and mindless final at the skating rink. Mr.Sam in fact was saved by his partner and fellow mercenary, the last one still alive by that time,Vincent, Jean Reno,who was also gunned down and left for dead just a few minutes earlier by IRA gunman Seamus O'Rourke, Jonathan Pryce. It's Seamus whom Mr.Sam, who turned out to be really working for the CIA, was after all along in the movie.

It turns out that the guy who was in possession of the suitcase team member, picked by Deindne, Gregon-Stehhan Sharsguard-planned to have Natacha shot while she was preforming her skating act to cover his escape. But that like everything else in the movie went bust with Gregor getting iced instead of paid off, with a bullet between his eyes, by his double crossing partner Mikhi that in fact set Gregor's plan into motion. It's then that a terribly scared Seamus reappeared, after he was almost killed in a flaming car crash, and started the fireworks in a massive gun fight, in and out of the skating rink, with him blasting away in all directions. Which all ended up blasting Seamus as well as almost everyone in the entire cast of the movie away! P.S Like in the film Heat we have director John Frankenheimer also have inserted into Ronin a recreation of that famous as well as forgettable diner scene where the two greatest actors of our time Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, who both starred in Godfather Part II but were never in a scene together, finally meet face to face over a cup of coffee and slice of cheesecake to chit-chat about nothing really all that earth shaking, like their meeting each other was supposed to be,in particular.

The company boss Franklin M.

There are a couple of instances where they may be contemplating killing him, and there is an accident where they think they do, but they settle instead with simply teaching him a lesson by trapping him in his house, making him see the error of his ways. By the end Hart has very much learnt his lesson to treat women much better, and the end credits say that Judy, Violet and Doralee went on to better careers and stuff. Also starring The Asphalt Jungle's Sterling Hayden as Russell Tinsworthy, Elizabeth Wilson as Roz Keith, Henry Jones as Mr. Hinkle, Lawrence Pressman as Dick Bernly, Marian Mercer as Missy Hart and Renn Woods as Barbara. The three female stars all do their vengeful characters as well as they can, the one that stands out for me is indeed Parton, and Coleman is a good choice to be the bastard mistreating them, I will admit it is not the funniest and most original film, it isn't such a bad comedy though.

Basically a group of English school children, all boys, are stranded on a deserted island after surviving a plane crash, and eventually they all unite on the beach. The boys all decide they need a leader, so they put it to a vote, and they choose Ralph (James Aubrey), instead of Jack (Tom Chapin), and for a while he is able to steer the boys, all aged between eight and fourteen years old. They work together to build a civilised and co-operative society until they can be rescued, building shelters and making fires, but they also make wooden spears and have knives. With the lack of rescue and the arguments for authority there are growing tensions between all the boys, to the point when there is violence to find food, and the group split into two. Jack is the leader of the more savage half, and Ralph and Piggy (Hugh Edwards) are doing their best to keep the remaining boys together, but almost have to stay together by themselves. There is a point when the savagery between the departed boys that a large rock is pushed and it crushes Piggy, Ralph has to run away and hide in the jungle. In the end the island jungle is set on fire, and Ralph running comes across a naval officer, who is shocked to see the children's' behaviour, and presumably they all get rescued. Also starring Roger Elwin as Roger, Tom Gaman as Simon, Roger Allan as Piers, David Brunjes as Donald and Peter Davy as Peter. All the young male actors do really well as the attitudes flair and arguments turn violent, the most memorable characters being Ralph, Pigg and Jack, it is a good gripping story where authority and no help are what create the problems for the young people, and there are certainly some dark moments, overall it is certainly a drama to see.

Much of the disappointment I feel for this film is because of how good it could have been.First off, the script - it was simply over the top. Often, more subtle humor works better - the audience does not need to be hit with a sledgehammer when a tack hammer will do the job. The plot, complete with twists (some predictable, some not) was workable - and there were some truly funny moments, but they ended up being overshadowed by the overdone bits.Much of the cast did good work - Ray Liotta turned out for a surprisingly good performance, and Jennifer Love Hewett surprised me with the quality of her performance. Ms. Weaver, however, seemed at many points to be simply reading the cue cards. In light of her usually excellent work, I can only surmise that she was as appalled by the material she was being asked to work with as I was, and couldn't get into the part and retain her self-esteem.There are some great lines, and the general plot is believable, but this is NOT a 'con' flick - the con artistry that movie viewers have loved in 'The Sting' and 'Ocean's Eleven' is pretty well blown by the general ineptness of the con artists.One remarkably onerous note may please some viewers. The mark (capably played with awful lines by Gene Hackman) is such a caricature of the offensive, rude smoker that it's likely to be offensive to anyone who knows, likes, or is a smoker themselves. The anti-smoking message was so loud that it ruined some scenes that could have been humorous otherwise.All in all, a worthwhile flick if you like the overdone comedy of 'Dumb and Dumber' better than you like, say, the obvious but not overplayed 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' or 'Bedazzled'.

Undoubtedly one of the best sci-fi films of all time, that's for sure. Never since this one, despite its original four sequels, Tim Burton re-make and 2011 re-boot, has the series been this hard hitting. Don't get me wrong; I enjoy all of the Ape films, finding something worthwhile in each one of them (while not denying the absurdity factor that would dampen the series in the 70s), but nothing compares to this one. Let me start by honoring the actors who helped cement the characters in our minds for all time. Charlton Heston as Taylor, wow, how iconic. The character represents the inner nihilism we all feel inside when we stare at the decadence of our society; the urge to feel that there is something better out there, just maybe. Of course this leads to the great irony of the story, all leading up to that unforgettable ending. Roddy McDowall, who played Cornelius (and would go on to play his son Cesar), is just excellent. I'm so glad he returned in the sequels. Who can forget Kim Hunter as Zira? Feisty, strong, intelligent, despite the elaborate prosthetics the character is definitely meant to symbolize the ideal woman in a sense. And Maurice Evans is so great as Dr. Zaius, one of the best villain sin cinema. This is due to the fact that he's indeed a villain, but when you think about it, a necessary villain. And what the hell, Linda Harrison will forever be remembered as Nova.John Chambers make-up effects are quite extraordinary, holding up to this day. The quality of the makeup would deteriorate until finally by 73's Battle for the Planet of the Apes most were merely mask. In its prime however, this process was so tedious the golden era actor Edward G. Robinson dropped out of the project early on stating that he was too old for the lengthy procedure.And the themes intertwined in the film make this quite enjoyable to watch again and again. Every single one of them is relevant to this day, making it timeless. Just a few would be the fragile relationship between religion and science, the treatment of creatures we do not perceive as sentient, and its best; the self destructive nature of mankind. And despite all its seriousness there's still quite a bit of fun to be had with it, leading to so many iconic lines. There are too many too count in this film, and I'm sure you've heard them before without even knowing it. Last but certainly not least, Jerry Goldsmith's score for the film remains one of the best he's ever done. There are many strange cues, of course accompanying the strange and often daunting images displayed. I'm sure everyone remembers the first time you see those ominous scarecrows. The beauty of the film I always admire is how it builds up quite nicely to the reveal without rushing it.

The scenes of mistreatment and torture are difficult to watch but they never feel exploitative or out of context.While most of the inmates give up hope, Papillon is determined to escape.

Cage's alcoholic is a buffoon and his behavior defies realistic behavior of the lush. He surrounds himself with every kind of booze imaginable, the serious drinker is a one brand user. He chugs a pint out of a bottle, a real alchie wouldn't and likely couldn't drink that way. Ms. Shue plays an experienced hooker, and does anyone believe that a pro would take three wild college kids into a room for tricks? Come on. What's more this woman is tolerant and loves a guy who is never sober, yet throws him out when she finds him in bed with another hooker. Where is her professional courtesy? Come on again.

The most curious aspect to a story such as this, involving such unduly, diverse characters a miserable recluse, a zesty, yet insecure waitress, and a sensitive and insightful, yet wronged homosexual, is that in their distinct differences, they share many of the same problems, and these problems eventually bring them all together, although hardly in a civilized manner. I appreciated practically every element in this wonderful, delightful masterpiece of exemplary romantic comedy, in its indelible acting (Oscars well deserved), its whimsical, touching screenplay (This was neons above Good Will Hunting's quality) and its comforting morale, that despite all of the great odds in life which prevent us from being happy, we can perhaps find it within ourselves to take that one important step in reversing our fortunes, in stopping with taking pills and to allow our lives, and our desires to shine and be realized, as this story depicts life. The best romantic comedy, certainly the best film of 1997, and one of the greatest films of all time, As Good As It Gets succeeds in practically every entertaining and endearing cinematic respect. **** out of **** ","genre":null},{"date":"20 March 2012","score":"","review":" Kinnear's character Simon has the distinct purpose in being both the bridge and the divider of Nicholson and Hunt's relationship, and he identifies with his character with compassion and understanding, as he has frequently been wronged throughout his existence.

I'm not even going to talk much about Halle Berry, who's only point in the film is eye candy basically. Then again, if I had boobies and was offered a bonus of 100,000 (which is in addition to the already paid $2 million) just to show them off well sh*t, wouldn't hurt right? This film's tone changes rapidly in a really bad meshing together of things. The beginning exposition pays tribute to a 'similar' (feels bad just typing it) film, Dog Day Afternoon and the scenario seems somewhat comparable at first. That is until one of the hostages makes a run for it and explodes which leads to a 360 degree view of the very large boom. Right then and there it breaks any ties it had to the subtle Dog Day Afternoon.The film parades around with this overdose of nice suits, nice cars and luscious women, over dampening its attempted political angle with Hollywood tripe. Was it really necessary to have Jackman hack a computer with a gun to his head AND getting a blow job? I mean how many people really bought that? And I don't mean to poke fun at the movie, but the amount of overly loud action scenes, with their exceptional explosions did initially lead me to believe it was a Michael Bay film. It isn't though&#x85; but was it trying to be? To be or not to be, that is the question.
