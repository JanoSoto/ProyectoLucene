Yet, it still seemed a flawed masterpiece. The DVD of the original version revealed that there were twenty deleted scenes--simply put, the movie was terribly over-edited. Sure, it was enigmatic, but it felt like a cheat in that so much vital information was withheld from the viewers. Yet, in spite of that, there was such grace, charm, suspense, and wonder that it drew me deeply in to this stunningly original work. . . But even in spite of six previous viewings, and listening to the director's explanation of the deleted scenes, nothing prepared me for the power of the director's cut, which is so well done, all I can say is you haven't seen Donnie Darko until you've seen the director's cut! Simply put, it's flawless. Acting, pacing, plot, characters, suspense, comic relief, and even sound effects are perfect. Jake Gyllenhaal is perfect as a dark kind of holy fool, a mentally troubled teen who is tormented by seeing a different world than what his peers experience. (And if you don't know by now, a key figure in that world is a gigantic, Satanic-looking rabbit who calmly prophesies the end of the world in 28 days.) All of the other performances are also superb, most notably those of his parents. Besides incorporating some of the deleted scenes (though not all), director Kelly much more closely integrates R. Sparrow's book into the story; scene changes become chapters unfolding as the countdown begins to the end of the world.If you haven't seen it yet, RUSH to where the director's cut is playing.

This was the first movie that I ever owned, and I grew up watching it. Batman was probably my favorite comic book hero when I was young, but I have never read Bob Kane. I completely understand why some Batman fans hate this movie, and it's probably the same reason why I dislike the Lord of the Rings trilogy. When you become familiar with someone's work and form your own interpretations, it becomes difficult to watch someone else change it.But by imagining that this movie has no ties to the original comic book except through the superficial use of its characters, it's not difficult to see an odd sort of genius behind it's making. When Tim Burton created this eerily dark version of Gotham City, he was making an homage to The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, which no doubt has had a great influence on his work. Maybe it's true that comic book movies don't blend well with film-noir, but if any comic book had to be chosen to do so, it would be Batman.I believe the reason why some people dislike this movie is because there's no character to identify with. In the first movie, we had Kim Basinger's character, who served as the movie's reality check, and we discovered Batman's world with her beside us. She is one of the heroes of the movie that we could identify with. However, the sequel has no one to guide us through. One of the qualities of film-noir is that there are no heroes, and that's certainly true in Batman Returns. The main characters in this movie are obviously insane and driven by their own selfish motivation the Penguin with his self-loathing and desire to make others feel his pain, Catwoman with her intense hatred of her boss and wish to free herself from a male-dominated world, Batman on his continuous quest to take revenge for his parents on every criminal he meets, and Max Shreck in his cynical love of profiteering. The characters aren't fighting for world domination or any of the more grandiose plots we see in comic book movies but for satisfying their emotional needs. There isn't a sense of morality or the incessant good vs. evil undercurrent that is so common in this type of a movie. The characters are caricatures of raw human emotions in collision, and it's interesting to note that the Penguin, Catwoman, and Batman don't even really hate each other. They fight only because they stand in each other's way, and as far as the acting goes, it's superbly under-appreciated.Michelle Pfeifer and Danny DeVito give the best performances in their careers. Pfeifer discovered that even though her face is covered by a mask, her lips are all that she needs to convey the seductive malice in her character. DeVito absolutely disappears behind the Penguin in a role that is both disturbing and incredible to see. (Has any other comic book movie ever dared to create a character that takes pleasure in biting a man's nose off?)All in all, the movie contains some brilliant cinematography by Stephan Czapsky, who also worked with Tim Burton on Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood. It's filled with strange sexual inhibition and a depressing outlook on the history and future of its characters, and so Batman Returns isn't a movie that will ever be liked or appreciated by a wide audience. But for those of us that do love the movie, we tacitly agree that it's the best comic book movie ever made, and we smile at all the Spiderman 2 yuppies.

Kim Basinger never looked more beautiful, and Rourke looked great, too. I disagree that there was no character development. I think there were depths to both characters that didn't come out until the end of the movie, which I found very poignant. Yes, I think it was more about power than sex, and when the moment of truth came for the balance of power to shift - as the Rourke character had planned for it to do - he had scared off his true love.

Perhaps that is why I wasn't as influenced by the hype which was created around the movie as some other people may have been. Overall I liked the movie, though I wasn't very impressed with the first 20 to 30 minutes.What is the story about? The young police officer, Jake Hoyt, who has a perfect family, wants to get a better job within the LAPD. He doesn't want to write parking tickets for the rest of his life, but wants to become a detective in the Narcotica Brigade. To get this job, he will get some help and advice from a detective which is already chasing the bad guys for many years, but who isn't afraid to cross the line from time to time. Hoyt will have to make some big decisions, will he stay the good cop or will he cross the line as well?This movie may be a little predictable from time to time, but overall there are enough twists and unexpected plots to keep you focused and interested. The action is well portrayed, without exaggerating and Denzel Washington is really fabulous. I guess many people were a little bit disappointed because he played another part than what they expected from him. I liked him and I would advice everyone to watch the movie.

Though Chaplin played his Tramp character superbly in other movies, like Modern Times and The Gold Rush, City Lights displays the Tramp at his funniest, his bravest, his most romantic, and his most sympathetic. It's tough for filmmakers in recent days to bring the audience so close emotionally with the characters, but it's pulled off. The film centers on three characters- the Tramp, the quintessential, funny homeless man who blends into the crowd, but gets caught in predicaments. He helps a drunken businessman (Myers, a fine performance in his own right) from suicide, and becomes his on and off again friend (that is, when it suits him and doesn't notice his 'friend's' state). The other person in the Tramp's life is the Blind Flower Girl (Virginia Cherrill, one of the most absorbing, beautiful, and key female performances in silent film), who are quite fond of each other despite the lack of total perception. The emotional centerpiece comes in obtaining rent and eye surgery money, which leads to a (how else can I put it) magical boxing match where it's basically a 180 from the brutality and viscerality of a match in say Raging Bull. Though there is no dialog, the film achieves a timelessness- it's essentially a tale of two loners who find each other, lose each other, and find each other again (the last scene, widely discussed by critics for decades, is moving if not tear-inducing). And it's never, ever boring- once you get along with the Tramp, you find the little things about him, the reaction shots, the little things he does after the usual big gag (look to the ballroom scene for examples of this, or when he gets a bottle of wine poured down his pants without the other guy noticing). Truth be told, if this film makes you indifferent, never watch Chaplin again. But if you give yourself to the film, you may find it's one of the most charming from the era, or perhaps any era.

This movie might very well be Oldman's worst role till date. He played many villains before and he has done way better. Compared to his other roles this is a very average role for him, it almost feel like he is holding back. I think it says something about Oldman as an actor that people still love him in this movie. Harrison Ford acts a bit stiff in the beginning but once the action begins he seems to become more and more comfortable in his role and becomes a believable American president. I love both Xander Berkeley and William H. Macy, they are two of my favorite small part actors so it was fun for me to see them both in this movie. Jürgen Prochnow, best known for his role as the captain in Wolfgang Petersen's masterpiece Das Boot also plays a small part in this movie.Like I said, the story is total non-sense but still it is not made like it's totally unbelievable, which is I think thanks to Petersen's professional directing and it is the action that also doesn't disappoint.Another thing that also doesn't disappoint is the musical score by Jerry Goldsmith.(SPOILER) A thing that does disappoint is the ending when air force one crashes into the sea. It's very poorly made and it reminded me of a computer animation the always used to made in the 90's to reconstruct a plane crash and showed on the news.

Having that said I must concluded that this movie was not what I had hoped and expected it to be.There are several things which I didn't liked about the movie. One of them is the visual style, I don't know but it was just all to dark for me, it didn't had a comic book feeling like movies as Spider-Man, Hulk and Batman all had. The X-Men uniforms also bothered me, yes I would had preferred yellow spandex! (inside movie joke). The movie also wasted too much time on character development and some characters are highly underused, mainly Storm and Jean Grey.I must say that let the movie mainly focus on Wolverine\/Logan was brilliant. For me Wolverine always was the most interesting character in the cartoon. It's too bad that they changed Rogue's character so intensely, it's not that it's not a good character it's just that I preferred the cartoon Rogue.One last thing that disappointed me was the musical score by Michael Kamen. It lacked a good main theme and while it is a fairly good score on it's own, it is not really fitting the movie.But yet again I make it sound like this is a bad movie. No, it's not a bad movie, it's far from it. The special effects are great and never overused. There are some spectacular fights and action sequences although the entire end fight was slightly disappointing for me. The movie in general is also too short.The entire movie was very well casted. Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman were all brilliantly cast! It was especially Hugh Jackman who was simply perfect in his role.

One false move, this could have been worse than Plan Nine From Outer Space. Thankfully, they got Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg behind this, who know how to make good, quality (and hit) films, and I don't think they could have made a better movie.Set in 1947 Hollywood, it deals with down-on-his-luck, hard-boiled private detective Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins, who does a great job, despite the fact that his British accent comes through once in a while) who is assigned by cartoon studio executive R.K. Maroon, to investigate Jessica Rabbit, the wife of one of his stars, Roger Rabbit, who is allegedly having an affair with the owner of Toontown, where all the cartoon characters (brand new and classic Disney ones) live, Marvin Acme. Valiant reluctantly accepts it because when he was younger, he and his brother Teddy, who lived to work in Toontown and help toons out, were on a case there and a toon dropped a safe on Teddy's head, killing him and leaving Eddie with a hopeless lack of sense of humor. Later, Roger is accused of murdering Marvin Acme over jealousy, and is sought by the eccentric Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd, who follows one eccentric Zemeckis role, Doc Brown, with this one), who wants to put him in his special dip which kills toons. Convinced Maroon made a patsy out of him, Eddie helps Roger prove his innocence, and in the process, it turns out that it is Judge Doom who not only killed Acme, but is also the Toon who killed his brother.Now, Roger Rabbit is none too bright, and anybody who's seen the movie can vouch for this, but he proclaims when he asks Eddie Valiant to help him that he could never hurt anybody, and that too, should be obvious to anybody who's ever seen the movie. I can remember seeing the movie when I was seven or eight in the theaters and saying, I never saw a cartoon talk to a person before. Which I'm sure everybody else thought too. But I can't recommend it enough for kids or adults because kids will love the enduring, lovable Roger and adults will appreciate the marvels of the movie, which were impossible before it, as well as appreciate how much hard work went into it.There was a book before this, Who Censored Roger Rabbit, in which they were comic strips not actors, it was set in present day and Roger and Jessica's marriage was fake like Bennifer. I also hear Roger wasn't as goofy in the book, so I prefer not to read it. Plus, he dies.
