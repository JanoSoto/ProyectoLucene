I mean, think about it. What kid wouldn't want to go on a tour of a magical candy factory and get the opportunity to test out the factory's latest inventions? Even if there are some people out there who don't for whatever reasons, this film offers something that is scrumdidilyumptious for everybody. Despite the film's title making it sound like it's the story of the candy factory's leader Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder), he actually isn't the main character. Our main character instead is Charlie (Peter Ostrum), a young boy who has to take care of his poor family by delivering newspapers in his town. When he hears that Willy Wonka, the world's greatest candy manufacturer, has hidden five golden tickets in five of his candy bars and that the lucky five who find it will be given a tour of his factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate, his seemingly crushed hopes are restored and he takes part in the worldwide search for these tickets. When he finds one of these golden tickets, he and his beloved Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson) join the other lucky four for the tour of a lifetime. The other four kids include one who eats excessively, one who chews gum constantly, one who keeps wanting more and more things, and one who watches television all the time. These other kids are very spoiled to say the least and let's just say they deserve whatever unusual punishment they get from Mr. Wonka and his employees, also known as Oompa-Loompas. One of the aspects about Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory that's always stood out for me, and I assume others as well, is the film's music. Just like some of the best children's musical fantasies out there, this picture is filled with timeless songs, chief among them The Candy Man, Pure Imagination, and the Oompa-Loompa songs. These songs written by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse have a wonderful melody and witty lyrics which will definitely help them last a long time. The production design and the way the filmmakers bring this magical factory to life is nothing short of inspiring. Even though a few props like the lollipop-shaped balloons are obviously fake by today's standards, I didn't mind since I still respect the lengths the filmmakers were willing to go with certain visual details of the production. For example, I thought the area with the chocolate waterfall and the candy garden along with Wonka's office where everything is in half were really cool. The acting by the ensemble cast is also worthy of mentioning. The child actors playing the lucky five children who tour Wonka's factory do an exceptional job at bringing these characters to life and convincing me that they really do have these certain qualities and\/or extreme tendencies. No other actor but Gene Wilder could have brought the eccentric genius known as Willy Wonka to life any better. The same thing could be said for Jack Albertson's portrayal of Grandpa Joe in terms of convincing me that he's still got it after lying in bed for 20 years. I even liked Roy Kinnear's performance as the father of the kid who always wants more since his character doesn't take his child that seriously and yet he always gets her what she wants. There are a few criticisms about this picture that I need to address. One is in regards to the film's first half which isn't quite as good as the second half. Even though this part of the film is good enough in its own right, I think there was too much time spent on the worldwide hysteria of this golden ticket search. Additionally, considering that this is a kid's flick, I found a few details regarding the ending to be needlessly complicated. Without giving anything away, I felt that there were a few plot details that it didn't prepare us for that well. Here's another thing I need to get off my chest. It isn't regarding the film so much as the audience's reaction to a certain scene in this film. I'm talking about the famous tunnel scene where Wonka and his guests are on a boat and the boat goes through a tunnel with objectionable projected images. This scene is referred to by some as one of the scariest scenes in film history. While I agree that this scene comes out of nowhere and I do believe it's a cool scene, I disagree with the interpretation that this scene is scary. I personally just think this scene wasn't supposed to be frightening as most people are making it out to be since it felt like the purpose of that scene wasn't necessarily scaring us. But that's just my personal take on the scene. As for the film as a whole, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory is unquestionably a real treat. For its timeless soundtrack, great ensemble cast, and phenomenal production design, this family film is worthy of repeated multiple viewings. I know I'm personally not done watching it yet after seeing it at least 25 times, and I'll look forward to revisiting it again sometime soon.

Here Harlin keeps the movie moving forward more than adequately, and manages to get us on the edges of our seats.The premise, admittedly, seems rather far fetched, as scientists working on a floating aquatic base are desperate to find the cure for Alzheimers', and experiment by utilizing a trio of sharks and their brain pans. Naturally, things start to go very wrong, as the sharks turn out to be much smarter than anybody anticipated. Also quite naturally, the crew has to deal with the fact that their base is slowly destructing, the result of the sharks' neat handiwork.Most of the cast plays this admirably straight, except for LL Cool J as the religious cook with the annoying pet parrot. The movie is already silly enough to not need this sort of thing. Thomas Jane is an effectively low key hero, while the rest of the cast - Saffon Burrows, Jacqueline McKenzie, Michael Rapaport, Stellan Skarsgard, and the almighty Samuel L.

While I agree that on technical terms the film leaves much to desire, but does that alone make Plan 9 the worse film ever made? I do not think so.Edward D. Wood Jr. was quite an character and a mediocre director at best (Insight entirely based on Tim Burton's 1994 biographical film Ed Wood), but his most famous production Plan 9 from Outer Space is unjustly labeled as the worse film ever. Granted the script, acting, screenplay and technical execution overall are sub par, but even with all its shortcomings, one must admire the directors relentless will to pursue his vision and produce films which defy the mainstream.Plan 9 from Outer Space is a movie which simply cannot be taken seriously and thus judging it purely on its technical merits alone seems unfair. I found myself mostly amused by the campiness and clumsy improvisations to which the director had to resort to in order to complete the film. And there were times when I found myself honestly interested with the out of this world story of space invaders who aim to stop humans from creating a doomsday weapon.. With the help of Zombie henchmen! Plan 9 from Outer Space is technically a bad film, no question about that, but I could name a dozen worse and more annoying films easily.

It is bathed in moments that will pull out a tear rout of even the manliest of men just by a monologue, a part of the soundtrack, a victory in a battle, a moment were friendship shines. It will make you cheer for the main characters and join them in their journey. I could talk about this masterpiece (yes I refer to the trilogy as one experience) all lifelong, so I will do my best to summarize my feeling in these three parts. My username is pablo2896 in IMDb and Pablo22in Metacritic by the way, so you can visit my three reviews. So let's get to the first one, the first movie. The Fellowship of the Ring tells the story of a young hobbit who is put in an overwhelming quest to rid his land of evil. And for me this is one aspect that makes me tear up a bit, the fact that one so small can squeeze out so much courage from himself. And this is no other than Elijah Wood's Frodo Baggins. Elijah does an amazing job acting as the main character. So the movie starts with a prologue explaining the founding of the one ring and how its master was defeated long ago. This clearly shows you what sort of a jaw dropping ride you are going into. It shows the amazing achievement of the special effects and the scale of these films. Then we are introduced to Frodo (Elijah Wood), this hobbit lives a perfect live in The Shire, a town were these hobbits live, eat and smoke weed (yes they even say it in the movie). His uncle Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) has carried the One Ring for a while, this entity that is consisted of the other half of the soul of Sauron, the evil bad guy. So he leaves it to Frodo who is then given the (almost) impossible task of taking it to the fires of Mt. Doom, the only place it can be destroyed and by doing so, vanquishing evil. And in the mean time Sauron sends his nine wraith to find this ring and kill everybody who goes in their way. Easy, right? Gandalf a powerful wizard, played by no other than Ian McKellen who perfectly portrays you the wisdom, the charm and the power of this conjurer, swears to protect Frodo at all costs in this journey and they take Sam with them, played by Sean Astin (who's incredible acting and character I will describe in my third review) Frodo's gardener with them. In their journey they meet some characters like Merry (Dominic Monaghan), Pippin (Billy Boyd) and no other than the badass Aragorn who 's actor Viggo Mortensen plays it amazingly, he is able to make you know he is a badass. So to summarize that part this movie has some of the best character developments I've seen in any movie. In the elvish sanctuary Rivendell they form the Fellowship of the Ring, which is consisted by the six characters I mentioned up there and three more, Boromir (a man), Legolas (an elf) and Gimli (a dwarf). Sean Bean, the actor who plays Boromir, does a good job in setting this character's conflicts and desires for the Ring of power, but it portrays his honor and loyalty also. Legolas and Gimli I thought would be more like filler characters but you feel interest for them and you connect to them immediately. The same can be said for Merry and Pippin. From Rivendell they embark to their destination, Mordor the Land of evil. God, I have to talk about the montage of the Fellowship traveling. It is an epic compilation of amazing landscapes and hair rising soundtrack. This is where I really felt the epicness of the movie. By the way this was pretty much the half of the movie, the buildup. So was it a typical long boring buildup? No, not in its least. They encounter dangers like spying crows sent by Saruman, an evil wizard who sides with Sauron at the beginning of the movie, and a treacherous storm (also sent by Saruman, what a dick) in the middle of a dangerous mountain which forces them to take another path, the Mines of Moria. Gimli explains to them that the dwarfs will welcome them in there but he's WRONG. They get there and the place is a graveyard, a graveyard made from dwarfs! So to summarize it they get trapped in there (blame the giant octopus) and now have to get across the dwarven city. Warning EPICNESS! They soon find out they are not alone, and no other than Pippin (fool of a Took!) wakes up every goblin infesting the mines. This leads to an awesome battle were you are cheering for the Fellowship while it slays goblins and a cave troll! They escape and make a run for the bridge of Khazad Dumb with an army of goblins on their backs and an awesome score which is beyond epic. But they realize something else is in those mines. A Balrog. A foe so powerful, only Gandalf can defeat it. They get to the bridge and the wizard faces it. In the most epic moments of the film he takes it down but unfortunately he goes down with it. You feel the loss yourself at this moment, seeing everyone in pain. In the rest of the film they more awesome characters like Galadriel and lose some like Boromir. Another thing that I love about these movies is the fact that no one is obligated to follow Frodo to his destination. They do it for friendship, one of the most important values in these films alongside honor and loyalty. I'm reaching the limit of words here so to summarize everything, 10 out of 10! Amazing.

This film looks at the dwindling marriage of Lester and Carolyn Burnham and the relationship of their daughter and the son of their new neighbor. There is also the relationship of that son and his father which is quite intense.In order for a film like this to work, there must be marvelous acting. Kevin Spacey is a very gifted actor and he is the perfect guy for Lester. He truly gives a powerful performance from the moment his voice over starts at the beginning of the film. Annette Bening gives a great performance as Carolyn. I also loved Chris Cooper as the military neighbor. His scenes were intense to say the very least.Overall, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. This is somewhat of a satire, but realism is integrated in the movie.

Not only was this film wonderfully acted, it had a steady pace, a well-written script, and wonderful directing by Michael Mann.Michael Mann's film is about a tobacco industry whistleblower named Jeffrey Wigand who got fired from his job and he decides to testify against the company thanks to the efforts of Lowell Bergmann and his 60 Minutes crew and the American legal system. However the careers of Wigand and Bergmann might be on the line if this goes out to the public.Al Pacino and Russell Crowe are two very talented actors that have blessed us with their screen talent over the years. Pacino seems to have gotten better with age and he showcases great acting in the film. Russell Crowe has a memorable performance as Wigand. He does a good job playing the shy, not-wanting-to-talk type of people.Overall, they have found away to make corporate dramas interesting as proved here. This could have easily been a dry, boring movie but the subtle directing by Mann makes this a thriller that will keep your mind and heart racing. However, I want to mention that although this is based off a true story, there are some changes made for dramatical purposes. But still, I don't go to the movies for a history lesson, but for enjoyment. I rate this film 9\/10.

Probably the most claustrophobic of his work, Talk Radio is set almost entirely within the radio studio in Dallas, Texas of controversial Talk Radio host Barry Champlain. By the way the original play was set in Cleveland, Ohio, but I'm figuring that Stone that Dallas with all it represents in American life is the best place to show an assassination.As it is his work Bogosian turns in one bravura performance of the protagonist character Barry Champlain. His confrontational style is winning him a lot of audience and he's got a sponsor ready to take him national. He's also got some personal problems including an ex-wife who won't let go, a boss in Alec Baldwin who's trying to put on some breaks and always his family of callers.The sheer anonymity of Talk Radio allows some really strange people to call in and express their views that they would never do over a polite dinner table. And like the people who enjoyed the Roman circuses we listen and enjoy and occasionally participate. Bogosian is getting his own kind of high with the power of the microphone and even more the power of the on and off button where he's guaranteed the last word.Stone was a prophet about Talk Radio. Even while this was in theatrical release Talk Radio was getting more and more powerful as an audience participation entertainment. For myself I want to be entertained, but television does that more than radio now. And if I want to be informed I'd better listen to all manner of views on all manner of stations and not just Fox radio or television. His confrontational style brings out the anonymous beast and Bogosian pays for it in the end.Talk Radio was based in part on the assassination of host Alan Berg from the Denver, Coloradio area by white supremacists. His killers were brought to some justice, one wonders if that will happen to Bogosian's assassin.In the supporting roles I best enjoyed Michael Wincott who played this metal head kid who on a whim Bogosian invites on his show.

Inspector 'Dirty' Harry Callahan is a San Francisco police officer, with an attitude and uses little methods to what the law prescribes. It becomes a menacing task for Callahan, as he's been assigned to apprehend the menacing killer at all cost, which later unravels into a cat-and-mouse game between the two men. One killer with a sinister, distasteful sense of humour. The other, a killer with just a plain dirty attitude who holds the badge.....What can be said about this film that already hasn't been said? It's Eastwoods most iconic roles and its one of the best movies ever made. And it stands the test of time for several reasons.It's quotable and then some. And not just the 'I know what your thinking....' line, its the endless sarcastic remarks Harry makes to his peers and the fact he gets away with it.And Siegel has a wonderful eye for beautiful shots.

Yes, it's even better than newer ones!I believe this movie is one of the proves showing how really good movie can stand with the test of time. Thanks to the lesson from Dr.No, now I must watch all of the legacy of this series. There must be so many I can't miss!

Mayer offering almost one million dollars to burn the original negative before the movie is released, tales of the battle between then 76 year old Hearst and then 25 year old Welles), and blow-by-blow tales of how the movie almost never made it to the theaters and was disappeared after a brief release...Welles became a movie star starting with Citizen Kane (1941), married Rita Hayworth, and was a mainstream Hollywood player during the 1940's and 1950's until his bad health and old age arrived early ended a not bad 20 year career in movies during which he was seen often on USA and world movie house screens.He even became a player in the world of television, which displaced Hollywood movies by 1960.......who can forget the Orson Welles Paul Masson Wine TV ads promising the world that Masson wines would never reach wine customers before it's time? Citizen Kane (1941) was and is an OK black and white movie hard to enjoy the first time through which became a long range media event, and still is.It is much more important as a media event and example of promotion and pop-scholarship than it is or was as a movie which stands on its own feet.10 stars for Citizen Kane (1941) for it's place in the big picture......not the same as 10 stars for being a good movie, pure and simple.Citizen Kane (1941) was never pure and simple.
