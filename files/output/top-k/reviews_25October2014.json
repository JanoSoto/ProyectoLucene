Some, like myself, do consider it to be an above average film, and not one of the worst of the series. While the film has it's faults, the storyline in this film is frankly better than those used in Halloween 5 and Halloween 6. The problem with this film mainly was that it was ahead of it's time. If Halloween Resurrection was released within the past five years(of writing this review) it would have been better received, I have little doubt about that. The following is my review of Halloween Resurrection.The film was written by Sean Hood and Larry Brand. The story on this film is pretty straight forward. It takes place about 3 years after the events of Halloween H20. Laurie is now in a mental hospital as she went crazy after she found out that Michael didn't really die at the end of H20. Michael actually killed one of the paramedics on scene and crushed his larynx so he couldn't say anything. Laurie then killed this paramedic by accident. She is haunted by this and is now in a mental hospital waiting for her real brother to come and kill her. We are then shown the night Michael Returns, but Laurie is ready this time. She has a trap for him on the roof of the building, but it backfires when she needs to remove his mask to make sure it is him. Michael then is able to turn the tables and finally kill his sister. Michael then goes back to his home in Haddonfield. He comes home to realize that an internet reality show is filming in his childhood home, and of course he will murder everyone in his house. As I mentioned above this story was ahead of it's time in regard to the reality programing. So many of us are use to seeing many horror type shows in famous houses that is first person based trying to find hauntings. Which is why I believe if this film were released in say 2012 instead of 2002, the film would have been a bigger hit and been more well received. I personally believe the story is not that bad. It is certainly not the worst of the franchise, and it moves nicely. Hood and Brand get a thumbs up in my opinion.The film was directed by Halloween 2 director Rick Rosenthal. If you have read my Halloween 2 review you already know I hold the opinion that that is the best sequel in this franchise. Rosenthal brought a more scare based approach to this film, which is what the franchise needed. Sure, there are still some over the top kills in this film that I could do without, but it wasn't as bad the previous film in this series(HalloweenH20). The acting is another big talking point about this film. Busta Rhymes is basically the star if you will. Many believe this was an awful casting decision, and I do agree. However, three years prior to this film another rapper(LL Cool J) starred in a Halloween film. The outrage against him is basically slim to none. The decision to cast Rhymes is a bigger role was not wise, but it certainly wasn't the worst thing in the world. However, I will admit that this is probably one of the worst acted films of the series. Jamie Lee Curtis phones in this very short part and acting legend Donald Pleasence had already passed about seven years before this film was released. Rosenthal delivers some nice scares that are a throwback to the original film more so than some of the slasher type sequels this franchise has turned out. I enjoy that and I think Rosenthal deserves credit for this outing.Danny Lux was the composer of this film, and he is mostly doing television shows these days. The score for this film has a John Carpenter feel to it, whereas some of the other sequels tried to change too much. That means the originality is at a low, but the film goes by nicely hearing that fantastic score we are so use to hearing in this series. Lux doesn't knock it out of the ballpark or create anything original, but he brings us that great classic Carpenter score that we all love.This film also marked the final effort from longtime series Producer, Moustapha Akkad. He was sadly murdered about three years after the release of this film in a terrorist bombing. Those hardcore fans of the series know him, and know his thoughts and opinions on the entire franchise very well. He didn't want Michael to die in any of the films, and just like Donald Pleasence, he wanted the series to continue as long as possible. He didn't want it to end. I love Moustapha for holding that for many decades as I myself never want to see the series end.Overall, it is not the best nor the worst film in the Halloween franchise. Sure it probably receives the most hate, but I can think of one or two films in this series that are worse. While it may not be the perfect way to have continued on the franchise, that really didn't matter as the series was rebooted entirely in 2007. The original franchise ended with this film, and while even I admit it wasn't the best way to end the amazing run, it was still an enjoyable way to end it's original run.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"25 October 2014","score":"","review":" The Following review will contain spoilers.Halloween Resurrection is a widely hated movie amongst the Halloween faithful.

This set a new wave of horror. Halloween is by far one of if not the greatest horror movie ever made that has been imitated but never duplicated by many other films like Friday The 13th. But let's face it, F13 doesn't even compare to the greatness of John Carpenter's classic. With not a lot of blood and gore, almost none at all, Halloween is filled with suspense, eeriness, plot building, character setting and an all out thrill ride that left audiences terrified. So the film starts of with 6 year old Michael Myers walking into his house, grabbing a kitchen knife, creeping upstairs and brutally murdering his sister. We then skip 15 years later where Dr. Sam Loomis is on his way to the insane asylum to transfer Myers. However, when he gets there, all the patients are found roaming around outside the hospital, including Michael Myers. Michael then steals Loomis' assistant's car and drives off into the night. We then go to the next day and are introduced to Laurie Strode, played by Jamie Lee Curtis in her first ever movie role. She then begins to see a strange man, which we know is Michael of course, who is stalking her and watching her. Then after about half an hour of stalking and creepiness it skips to night, which is when the films really starts to pick up. Laurie is babysitting with a few friends. Little does she know, Michael has decided to crash the party and so he kills her friends off one by one, leaving her clueless as to what is going on. She then goes exploring to find out what has happened to her friends, only to discover, they have been killed by Michael. Michael then appears in a closet\/doorway behind her, slashes her shoulder with his knife, she then falls down the stairs, and then the big chase is on and it leads to a huge adrenaline rushing, blood pumping thrill ride, with a fantastic ending of Michael somehow disappearing after been shot off the balcony by Dr. Loomis who had been chasing him all night and coming up short. The film then ends with audiences shocked and scared. Honestly, what more can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? It is a classic, no doubt about it. It is simple, basic, scary, creepy and the setting is fantastic. The acting is perfect, the characters are perfect, and Michael Myers is creepy as can be. This film even spawned a huge franchise which many have come to love. Halloween is my all time favorite horror film or even my favorite film altogether.

The movie was profitable (though not as much as Snow White), but the critical reaction was less enthusiastic as what came for Snow White. Seeing the movie today, one can understand why this was so. Now, I will say that the animation is very good; there are some really detailed bits of animation that will make you wonder how they were pulled off without the use of computers.However, great animation is not enough for an animated movie. Disney understood that an animated movie needs a good script as well; long periods were spent by his staff polishing the stories for their animated movies before the drawing started. This was not the case for Gulliver's Travels; it was rushed into production, and it clearly shows in the end results. None of the characters, for one thing, are particularly compelling. They are thin, and sometimes they are annoying. Also, the story is inadequate.

After early successes with The Producers and Blazing Saddles, he settled down into lazy parodying of Hollywood blockbusters of the time which this clearly is. It isn't his worst film and as a kid, I loved the goofiness of it all very much. But time and advancing years have weakened my once-high opinion - it has its moments and at times, is quite inspired. But the whole thing feels juvenile and low-brow and not as smart as Brooks is capable of.In a strangely familiar galaxy far far away, the peaceful planet of Druidia is about to celebrate the forthcoming nuptials of Princess Vespa (Daphne Zuniga), who sadly runs away at the last minute. Blasting off into space, she runs straight into villainous Spaceballs intent of draining Druidia of its precious air supply. Led by Dark Helmet (Rick Moranis) and President Skroob (Brooks), Vespa and her droid valet Dot Matrix (voiced by the late Joan Rivers) are captured and her only hope lies with two space adventurers - the rugged Lone Starr (Bill Pullman) and his half-man, half-dog companion Barf (John Candy).Spaceballs is not the most sophisticated of parodies but it certainly has its share of moments. Candy is brilliant as Barf, complete with a wagging tail that has a penchant for trouble and flopping ears. Moranis probably steals the show as the epically incompetent Dark Helmet but Brooks is disappointing as Skroob and the mystical mentor, Yogurt (no prizes for guessing who he's a parody of) and Rivers feels sadly underused. The effects, for all the madness going in within the movie, are also pretty good for its age - model shots of flying Winnebago's and the vast Spaceballs vessel look detailed and almost plausible, if you can ignore the comic bumper stickers (I *heart* Uranus!). But I'm afraid the film does have one or two issues. The majority of the humour is largely based around funny names and ham-fisted mickey-taking. Yes, the endless parade of Spaceballs merchandise is amusing and used to good effect but it feels clumsy and lacking the wit we all know Brooks possesses. The endless Jewish jokes didn't come as a surprise and didn't make me laugh either and the camp sexual shenanigans of various buxom bit-parts felt very out-of-date even then.But the film's biggest problem is that, like a lot of Brooks' films, it raises a smile but rarely any belly laughs. Spaceballs is a good effort but the quality of the writing lets it down, making it feel like a childish version of Star Wars and frankly, one that only a child would enjoy. It feels wrong to be this harsh on a film I once enjoyed but like Caddyshack, I missed the magic the second time I watched it once I'd grown up. Parody films are hard to get right and to be honest, no-one has done anything better than the brains behind Airplane! - Jim Abrahams and the brothers Jerry & David Zucker. Brooks always felt like he was teasing us - his talent for comedy is unquestionable but sometimes, he seems to take things easy. Spaceballs is a case in point - despite flashes of brilliance, it remains a solid but unspectacular watch that would only appeal to those viewers sick of any version of George Lucas's space opera. I just wished that I could have switched my brain back to my ten-year-old self and enjoy it much more.

It is filled with strange and surreal imagery that could very easily put you off. Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) is a man living in a dystopia of a city in the future United States. His angry girlfriend Mary X (Charlotte Stewart) has recently given birth to a strange deformed mutant baby, that cries constantly to the point where Mary is driven insane. She leaves and Henry is left to take care of it. I won't say anything else because from then on is just strange imagery everywhere.

His debut film, Texas CHAINSAW, might be the greatest horror film in modern times, a benchmark in which to compare all horror movies since. So, why is it that he's never really been able to come close to the majesty of that movie? Yes, you can point to POLTERGEIST, but many in filmdom would argue that movie is more Spielberg than Hooper.I would put this movie in a similar category with EATEN ALIVE, his previous film, a movie which I seem to enjoy far more than most. Both movies carry a similar problem, though. They are gorgeously filmed, stylishly lit, artistic slashers with wooden characters, dull plots and poor pacing. Part of that blame lies in the screenwriters, to be sure, but it's as if Hooper spent far too much time worrying about how to shoot his films and not enough wondering if it was a worthwhile film to make in the first place.The movie starts off with an homage to HALLOWEEN, introducing us to the main heroine and her kid brother who will be pivotal to the plot. We could, also, argue here that there is a fine line between paying homage and ripping off. Our final girl has a typical a*hole boyfriend who is taking her to a carnival against her father's wishes, with two stereotypical teens in tow. From here, the movie spends a little bit too much time with the teens exploring the carnival. It badly cries out for something similar to the Hitchhiker scene in TCM to establish a bit of tension that will carry the plot through this portion, something that portends the doom to follow, but it's essentially nothing more than 4 generic teens walking around a carnival. When I say generic, I mean it. There is no personality to here. Nothing to like or dislike. They exist only to die later. I do think Kevin Conway's multiple appearance as a carny barker are good here and help to set somewhat of a tone. There's something inherently creepy, to me, about that poor audio, cheap microphone sound that's used well. The fun starts when the teens decide to spend the evening in the funhouse. This is where Hooper really shines. He uses the spooky qualities of the old school carnival shocks to maximum effect, combined with his always excellent sense of lighting to create a genuinely unsettling funhouse atmosphere.The teens then witness something that will spell out their inevitable doom and our creature is unmasked in a reveal reminiscent of Chaney's PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. The monster makeup is excellent and provides a unique slasher villain. From here, though, the movie just never goes anywhere you want it to go. Hooper sets up these amazing sets and excellent shots and you want so much for him to use this setting to the same max effect that he was able to use the old farmhouse in TCM, but it never gets there. The killings become paint by the numbers, formulaic slasher deaths, all leading up to the inevitability that our final girl will escape and the monster will meet its' demise.It's better than the majority of generic slashers that came out in the wake of HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13th, but can't quite elevate itself to classic level.

Still, this is a pretty good movie, and it can't be denied that it has a very original plot for its time of production.The Nightmare Before Christmas tells the comedic and creepy adventure of Jack Skellington and Santa Claus. Jack is a living skeleton of sorts, and the king (celebrity) of the fictional Halloween Town, where Halloween was invented and morbid and eerie yet very friendly creatures of all sorts reside, from clowns to black cats to vampires. Halloween Town is ruled by an overweight cone-headed, two-faced mayor, who closely resembles a demonic Patrick Star. Each year the town has a Halloween contest to see who in town is the scariest, and Jack is outvoted once again. Bored of the same routine every year, he doesn't realize that he has an admirer, a scarecrow named Sally who doesn't exactly have a free and adventurous lifestyle herself. She was built by a mad scientist and is forced to be his servant.One day Jack wanders off and ends up finding the glittering, exciting world of Christmas Town, where life is cheerful and happy and the exact opposite of his own society.

O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for o'erdoing Termagant. Pray you avoid it. The really, really epically BAD Hearing Kenneth Branagh speak these lines as Hamlet to the player is an accidentally comical ironic turn; as what Hamlet would have a fellow whipped for is exactly what Branagh does. I had a strong appreciation for Branagh before seeing him as Hamlet; now I cannot shake the pomposity of this performance. This pomposity worked well when he played Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, but for Hamlet...not so much. Branagh accelerates from zero to 300 miles per hour in a second in almost all of his dialog. WHEN Branagh remembers to take his time his restraint gives the dialog force and meaning. His instantaneous shift to screaming at 300 miles an hour shatters the beauty of the dialog. Hamlet beseeches, for in the very torrent,tempest, and whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. There is no temperance nor smoothness. Additionally, besides being far to old,Branagh's Hamlet seems like a spoiled brat. He doesn't seem like someone who could lead an army or rule a country. He certainly doesn't seem like someone one would bet on in a fencing dual. I'm no fighter, but I felt like I could kick is ass, and at times wanted to.From a directorial perspective, Branagh answering the question of did or did not Hamlet and Ophelia have sex totally ruined the complexity of that whole element of the play.The regular bad to mediocre Many of the other performances are mediocre or worse, but pale in comparison to Branagh. The set and setting seemed garish and far too bright. Wonderfully filmed; but as over the top as Branagh's performance. It often made the actors seem tiny. I am a fan of Brian Blessed, and think he did a fine job as the Ghost of Hamlet's Father, but when he first makes himself known to Hamlet and Hamlet is compelling Horatio and Marcellus to swear by his sword the ground is exploding around them. Also, Hamlet has a wimpy little sword that looks like a $10 toy, which he kisses at one point. Later, he is playing with letter opener that is supposed to be a dagger. Insert your own Shakespearian phallic jokes here. The Good Doing the whole play. The subtleties of the relationships and politics of the play require seeing at least most of it. Some suggest that the movie is too long. I think it should have been made longer by letting the actors take their time and give the dialog its due. If you are going to have a movie 4 hours long, you may as well go more than 4 hours to get it right. It would have likely required breaking the play into 2 movies, perhaps shot at once and released within 6 months or a year of each other. Sort of how the Lord of Rings trilogy was produced. I appreciate the difficulty of making a movie longer than 2 hours from a business point of view. I will watch this movie in the future, just so I can see the whole play.Derek Jacobi was amazing as Claudius; no other performance in this film compares. I never found Claudius an interesting character before this performance.Kate Winslet as Ophelia was very good. I loved Charlton Heston as the Player. Nicholas Farrell as Horatio was excellent. Timothy Spall and Reece Dinsdale did a nice job as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.For reference I have read the play at least 6 times. I am not a big Mel Gibson fan, but I do wish Franco Zeffirelli would have made his 1990 version of Hamlet with Mel Gibson the compete play. Maybe release the version he did and a complete version; but alas it is not to be so. I have watched the Laurence Olivier version once, the Kenneth Branagh version 3 times, the Franco Zeffirelli version 5 or 6 times. I have watched the definitive version of Hamlet; which is Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead dozens of times.

The really, really epically BAD Hearing Kenneth Branagh speak these lines as Hamlet to the player is an accidentally comical ironic turn; as what Hamlet would have a fellow whipped for is exactly what Branagh does. I had a strong appreciation for Branagh before seeing him as Hamlet; now I cannot shake the pomposity of this performance. This pomposity worked well when he played Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, but for Hamlet...not so much. Branagh accelerates from zero to 300 miles per hour in a second in almost all of his dialog. WHEN Branagh remembers to take his time his restraint gives the dialog force and meaning.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"25 October 2014","score":"","review":" Dustin Hoffman had already been riding high in the movies long before doing this. Things like The Graduate and Midnight Cowboy showed that he was then and is now one of the best of the best. Kramer vs Kramer is arguably his best movie and most powerful performance. The only other arguably better is Rain Man. But Kramer vs Kramer and Rain Man are vastly different, with both leaving equal impacts.Ted Kramer (Hoffman) is a successful workaholic advertising executive. One night after returning home late with big news, he finds out his wife (Streep), who feels isolated and socially abandoned, is leaving him and their son Billy (Henry). Ted's frustrations about being both parents to Billy and doing well in his job become virtually unbearable. While Billy must deal with the abandonment of his mother and the weak relationship he has with his father. Just as Ted starts becoming a good parent to Billy and a success again at work, Joanna returns wanting her son back. Ted bears a slim chance of winning.I read the Avery Corman novel before seeing the movie. It was the first and only time I have ever legitimately cried while reading. Some things in the movie have been changed, but most things have just been taken away. The novel isn't long, but the movie would likely be a miniseries if went directly by the book. So is the book better than the movie? With a different cast, it would have been. As mentioned before, Hoffman gives the performance of a lifetime as a pressured yuppie. Hoffman plays Ted as a heroic type that will do anything he can to be the best parent he can be. Meryl Streep won her first Oscar for and is also one of her most underrated roles. One of the themes in the movie is women's rights and gender equality, that is seen as Joanna gives reasons for walking out on her husband and son. Justin Henry was just a little kid that gave a better performance than half of everybody in 1979. In the 70s, divorce was an uncommon thing. Now, divorces happen left, right and centre. So Kramer vs Kramer is perhaps more relevant today than in the 70s. With divorce and custody as the main themes, gender equality, social abandonment and work balancing are other themes that are shown very well in this. You will watch this movie and never forget how it impacts you.
