However if this was the best film of 2001 then it certainly was a mediocre year for movies. Yes the ending was moving but in a melodramatic movie-of-week sort of way. Jennifer Connelly gives a superb performance and she adds depth to her role as the stoic supportive wife. We can see her fear grow as the evidence mounts against her husband. Through her frustration the audience gets a sense of how hard it would be to stand by someone with that kind of illness. This makes the payoff at the end all the more sweet. But the fact that Nash's life story was cleaned up for the big screen does unfortunately detract from the movie. One can almost feel the focus groups and marketing surveys determining how the film will finally play out. This is a shame because of the remarkable and convincing way the audience is set-up to discover that Nash suffers from schizophrenia. If the film had gone on past the point where it ended I think it would have scored a bullseye. Because even without knowing that certain parts of Nash's life were left out, I still wondered if he really said the things he said when he gave his speech. The fact that the film ends where it does already seemed to make it just a little too much Hollywood. That parts of his life were left out to make the picture more commercial makes me wonder if other parts were over emphasized for dramatic effect. This takes a good film down a notch.

I think the biggest problem is the script. It has some interesting ideas, and consistently presents a character or event, and then attempts to subvert it. Unfortunately, this exists alongside of some painfully obvious writing.The worst of this relates to Sandra Bullock's character. She has a past, and every time she thinks about it, the movie grinds to a total halt, and the viewers roll their eyes. This is presented in such a hammer-to-head way that there may as well be a flashing title on the bottom of the screen saying THE PAST! during these scenes.When Sandra reaches for a file with her personal information in it, it may as well be bright yellow with THE PAST written on it in black block letters. Then the moment ends and the movie starts up again... until the next one. When the nature of this event in the past is revealed, it is both too much, too simplistic, and too unrelated to her character.Her character is a screen writing construct, never a real person for one instant. If she were a real person, this woman would not be able to hold down a steady job. By the sixth or seventh time that she has been taken off the case and pleads to reopen it because she's spent her personal time and money... you'll be ready to leave. It's admirable that they try to present such an unpleasant character... but a mainstream thriller does not allow them enough space to follow through as it needs to be. She comes off as just crazy.On top of this, Sandra Bullock is utterly wrong for the role. I admire that she seems to have purposely picked a role that is wrong for her and tries to make something of it, but I guess that there's a difference between a stretch and a role that is just wrong. She doesn't project the authority needed, she subverts her tough lines with her cute delivery (or her I'm super tough now, see! delivery), etc. I don't know why she wants to play these roles. So many have said it's such a departure from Miss Congeniality, but to me it's the same role the ace detective who is mannish and who is mocked by her male counterparts for being tough. But I think a better script and a better director could have given her something to do. I am one of those people that just likes her, even though the stuff she does is not that great, but on this movie I was saying to myself WHY do you like her? I thought her strongest work was in Practical Magic... but she seems forever stuck in movies that are messes that could have had potential. Sandra, call me, I'll write you something good.Schroeder's direction on this makes you (thinking back to Reversal of Fortune,) realize the power of a good script and great performances. The direction here is so obvious, plain and plodding... it's amazing this guy has any kind of reputation for quality.The two kids are good, not as great as everyone says, but certainly courageous. They would be better if the script were better.The aura of mediocrity that surrounds this movie is surprising. The trailer is BAD. It clearly tells the viewer this movie is second-rate, don't bother. When coupled with the worst movie poster in recent memory... I think Bullock and co. should be wondering why Warner decided to telegraph so clearly to the public that this one was such a fourth priority.The sense you get leaving this movie is that the writer is talented and has good ideas, but is restraining himself and adding false elements because he has to constantly clip his story to conform to Hollywood formula. This film is a good example of how it would be IMPOSSIBLE for a thoughtful and deep story to be made by anyone who hopes to make money on it.

So many have said it's such a departure from Miss Congeniality, but to me it's the same role the ace detective who is mannish and who is mocked by her male counterparts for being tough. But I think a better script and a better director could have given her something to do. I am one of those people that just likes her, even though the stuff she does is not that great, but on this movie I was saying to myself WHY do you like her? I thought her strongest work was in Practical Magic... but she seems forever stuck in movies that are messes that could have had potential. Sandra, call me, I'll write you something good.Schroeder's direction on this makes you (thinking back to Reversal of Fortune,) realize the power of a good script and great performances. The direction here is so obvious, plain and plodding... it's amazing this guy has any kind of reputation for quality.The two kids are good, not as great as everyone says, but certainly courageous. They would be better if the script were better.The aura of mediocrity that surrounds this movie is surprising. The trailer is BAD. It clearly tells the viewer this movie is second-rate, don't bother. When coupled with the worst movie poster in recent memory... I think Bullock and co. should be wondering why Warner decided to telegraph so clearly to the public that this one was such a fourth priority.The sense you get leaving this movie is that the writer is talented and has good ideas, but is restraining himself and adding false elements because he has to constantly clip his story to conform to Hollywood formula. This film is a good example of how it would be IMPOSSIBLE for a thoughtful and deep story to be made by anyone who hopes to make money on it. This movie ends up mediocre by staying in the middle, trying to play it both ways. I think they either need to go one way, make a deep and involving film to appear on cable over several episodes, or go for total trash.

A Streetcar Named Desire left me wanting so much more.  *Spoilers Ahead!*I instantly fell in love with this movie within the first five minutes when I was introduced to the scenery.  What a lively place New Orleans was!  Where it didn't matter if you were poor, just have fun!I than became acquainted with the characters.  This movie has some of the best characters ever. We meet Blanche (Vivien Leigh), who at first comes off as a chatter-box, completely full of herself.  Later in the movie I found myself puzzled over her.  Is she crazy?  Old?  A pedophile?  Her character puts you in a depressed mood that you can't escape from. I can't type another sentence without commenting on how much Leigh deserved that Oscar.  The Next character we meet is Blanche's sister, Stella(Kim Hunter).  She comes off as a sweet young women who gives in to her husband every time they are in a fight.  She stays that way until the very end.  The next character, a very complex fellow, is Stanley (Marlon Brando).  He is almost hard to describe...  I guess you could call him a drunk.  Many people detest his character because of the actions he takes.  But Stanley to me, was different.  Sure when he was drunk and he could be brutal and awful but when he realized what he did to Stella he is torn up and ashamed.  We see him, a strong brute of a man, break down at Stella's feet.

Brando does a decent job (if one can understand all his patented mumbling), but Malden is the revelation.

Jurado has less to do as her mother, but still scores. Brando has a few sidekicks along for the ride. Johnson does well as a ruthless wanted man and Gilman (a costar in no less than five other Brando films) is okay. The film has some great scenery and some strong music.

Paradis is Adele, a twenty-something waif who looks like a Parisian model except for the charming and disarming gap between her two front teeth. She's sur la pont and looking to jump off into the Seine. Auteuil appears as Gabor, a forty-something carnival knife thrower, looking for a new and more exciting target. He taunts her a little, shames her a bit. She gets insulted and jumps. He jumps in right after her.Well, I have it on good report that Nora Ephron is jealous as hell. I mean wouldn't, say, Meg Ryan and Mel Gibson just be adorable meeting like this?I...don't...think...so. For one thing, this would never work in the American cinema since one of the essentials is that the boy be twenty years older than the girl so that his patience with her frequent liaisons is plausible. Hollywood would have to find another slant on their relationship (something banal no doubt) and alter the ending to make it more romantic. But Hollywood can do that! Watch for the remake--a Nancy Meyers film, directed by Ephron--in theaters everywhere, circa 2010. Since the script, containing some very witty dialogue by Serge Frydman, and the fine acting by Auteuil and Paradis, carry the show, Director Patrice Leconte was able to film this on the cheap in glorious black and white, which doesn't detract from the film at all. I didn't really notice there was no color until about twenty minutes in because I was so taken with, first, Paradis as the girl who could never say no, and then Auteuil who is funny, commanding, and obviously having a great time. By the way, the device of her being interviewed to open the film makes us think for a moment that we are being shown a video recording of that interview. Following a well-established cinematic convention of rendering video recordings in black and white, this makes our minds accept the black and white cinematography without question.Paradis is child-like and sexy by turns. The scene after the train passes and she says to Gabor something like, You KNOW what I want to do, and I want to do it NOW, leads to a rather strange, but clearly erotic, symbolic sexual experience. Paradis plays her part very well.The theme is the mystery of capricious luck, believed in passionately by those who feel they have none, which is how Adele and Gabor feel before they meet each other. Together, however, they can call the number at roulette, win at the lottery, and find gold on the ground!The enigmatic and rather predictable ending warrants some pondering. Are they going to live happily ever after as man and wife, lovers, or as a kind of father\/daughter team? It's not clear, and that's deliberate. Draw your own conclusions, but don't miss this one.

He's currently handling a probate case worth millions to the firm; he's due in court, where he simply has to present a document that will, for all intents and purposes, wrap up the proceedings.  But fate is waiting in the wings.  In another part of town, Doyle Gipson (Samuel L. Jackson) is also about to wrap up a deal-- a loan for a house that will keep his estranged wife, Valerie (Kim Staunton), from moving with their two boys, Stephen (Akil Walker) and Danny (Cole Hawkins), to Portland, Oregon, or as Doyle sees it, half way across the world.  \tWhen Gavin and Doyle get into their respective cars to head to court, they are strangers to one another; they are about to meet, however, when heavy traffic on the expressway and their own preoccupied mental states precipitate a collision-- a minor car accident that ultimately effects a much bigger wreck in both their lives.  In his rush to meet his appointed court time, Gavin leaves the scene of the accident and, more importantly, leaves Doyle-- who also has an appointment in court (his child custody hearing, no less)-- stranded, and out of time.  Ironically, the document Gavin must file in court is inadvertently in the confusion of the accident left behind on the expressway, and is now in Doyle's hands.  And so the conundrum; loss of the document may mean jail time to Gavin.  To Doyle, the loss of twenty minutes may mean losing his children.  The question now is, how will these two men solve their dilemma?  One has what the other needs, but how do you give `time' back to someone?\tThis film, nicely fashioned by screenwriters Chap Taylor and Michael Tolkin, and extremely well crafted and delivered by director Michell, is at it's core a character study that examines the effects of desperation and the emotional responses elicited thereof.  It explores how anger and frustration can in the heat of the moment negatively affect even an individual who under normal circumstances is predisposed to abiding by his own conscience; how even the most rational among us has the capacity for irrational behavior if provoked by unmitigated circumstances.  At one point in the film, one of the characters observes that it's like two guys have been dropped into a paper bag together and shaken up, just to see what happens; and that about sums it up.  And Michell does an excellent job of keeping the story on track, setting a good pace and maintaining the tension that keeps the audience involved.  It's straightforward storytelling that is well presented and effective.\tAs Gavin, Affleck gives a solid performance, developing his character quite nicely as the story unfolds.  When the film begins, Gavin is in a comfort zone, a place that allows him the tunnel vision necessary to do what he does with a clear conscience.  In a way, he's naive; a guy who's been led down the path and made to believe that all is well in the land of the free.  By the end of the film, we see a different Gavin-- or at least an `awakened' Gavin; the same man, perhaps, but with an entirely different perspective on life.  And Affleck's portrayal makes it convincing, and brings Gavin to life in a very real way.  A good job by a fine young actor with the ability to tap into that emotional depth that makes his character believable.\tSamuel L. Jackson hits his stride, as well, as Doyle, a character whose outward demeanor masks the complexities lying beneath the surface, but which Jackson brings incisively to light.  Doyle is your average guy, an insurance salesman, but a man plagued by the demons of addiction; he's a man addicted to chaos, evidenced by the failed relationships in his life and his inability to cope with the situation engendered by his encounter with Gavin.  Jackson creates a character with whom you can empathize, even as he makes you aware of the rage within him that could explode at any minute.  Doyle understands only too well the dire, probable consequences of being unable to quell his anger, and through his portrayal, Jackson makes the audience aware of it, as well; and it's a pivotal point in the story, which he successfully conveys.  And it's that unstable element of Doyle's personality that makes this more than just a story about right or wrong, or who's going to win; it means anything can happen, and it keeps you wondering right up to the end what that something is going to be.\tThe supporting cast includes William Hurt (The Sponsor), Toni Collette (Michelle), Richard Jenkins (Walter), Tina Sloan (Mrs. Delano), Ileen Getz (Ellen), Sam Rovin (Paralegal) and Jennifer Dundas (Mina).  A morality tale that, be advised, does not take too kindly to lawyers, `Changing Lanes' is an engrossing film that delivers much than what is promised, even, by the trailers; a worthwhile cinematic experience.  8\/10.              \t     \t\t ","genre":"Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"2 May 2002","score":"9 out of 17 people found the following review useful","review":"  \tWith the advent of the internet, all things electronic or digital, and fast food, our world has become altogether too small, and everything moves entirely too fast.
