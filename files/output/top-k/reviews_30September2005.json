The three main characters are Stingo, a young writer from the Deep South, and Nathan and Sophie, the couple who befriend him. Nathan is a Jewish New Yorker who tells Stingo that he is a research biologist for a pharmaceutical company. Sophie is a Polish gentile immigrant who has survived imprisonment in Auschwitz by the Nazis. At first the atmosphere is relatively light, one of love, friendship and fun. This part of the film is shot in brilliant colour in a summer setting, and the affluent suburbs of New York seem a safe haven from the horrors of the war that has recently ravaged Europe.Gradually, however, the tone darkens as we become aware that the gentle, beautiful Sophie is hiding a dark secret. We learn that her beloved father was not, as she claimed, an anti-Nazi intellectual, but was actually a rabid anti-Semite and admirer of Nazism whom the Germans murdered by mistake. Nathan originally seems eccentric but vivacious and likable, but as the film progresses he begins to show signs of disturbance, insulting Stingo whom he has previously treated as a friend, and unreasonably suspecting Sophie of being unfaithful to him. We, and Stingo, learn from Nathan's brother that he is in fact suffering from mental illness and that he is only employed by the pharmaceutical company in a lowly clerical position, not as a research scientist, although Sophie remains unaware of these facts.In 1982 there had been many films made about the Second World War, but relatively few about the Holocaust, which seemed to daunt film-makers by its very enormity. Alan Pakula was therefore breaking new ground, particularly as he approached the subject from a controversial angle, tackling the question of war guilt- not the legal and moral guilt of those who perpetrated the Holocaust, but the psychological guilt of those who survived it. After liberation from the camps, many survivors such as Sophie experienced feelings of guilt that they had survived whereas many others, including friends and family members, had died. Sophie's feelings of guilt are exacerbated by her knowledge of her father's odious political views and by the fact that she had attempted to exploit her father's reputation and her fluent knowledge of German in an attempt to ingratiate herself with Rudolf Hoess, the commandant of Auschwitz, whose secretary she became. Sophie's most agonising secret, however, is the choice of the film's title- the fact that she was forced by a brutal Nazi officer to choose which of her two children should live and which should die. Her love for the Jewish Nathan, whom she clings to despite his mistreatment of her, may be a way of atoning for her guilt feelings.There are a few weaknesses in the film. During the first half the action can be too slow, and Stingo, as played by Peter MacNichol, seems a fairly weak figure. The scene of his sexual encounter with a girl who talks like a whore and acts like a prude would be funny in a comedy but is out of place in a serious film like this one. Despite these weaknesses, however, this is a film which more than justifies its ambitious theme. Meryl Streep is one of the greatest film actresses of all time, and certainly the best of the early eighties, and this is possibly her best-ever role. She demonstrated her famed linguistic talents, playing the Auschwitz scenes in excellent German and the English-language scenes with a Polish accent, but (contrary to what some hostile critics have sometimes claimed) there is more to her acting than a collection of foreign accents. One criticism that is sometimes made of Streep is that she is too intellectual an actress, self-consciously thinking her way into a part rather than trying to live it emotionally, but in this case at least this seems to be the right approach. It is difficult to see how the Method could cope with a role like Sophie, whose emotional experiences are so far beyond those of any actress likely to be called upon to play her. Certainly, I found this one of the most affecting performances I have seen. Never can the Best Actress Oscar have been better deserved. Kevin Kline was unlucky not to have been nominated for his part as the tormented and tragic Nathan. This is a dark, sombre film but one of high quality and great emotional power. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"30 September 2005","score":"8 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" Sophie's Choice is set in Brooklyn in the late 1940s, soon after the end of the Second World War.

Its derivate, Pay it forward, would be one of the greatest films, if American Beauty didn't exist, but in its presence it looks like a weakened and diluted copy.Despite the Oscar awards and despite the overwhelming number of 10-star comments on the IMDb site, this film is still misunderstood by many. There are brainless, fanatical, religiously fervent, moralistic people (who actually don't have the slightest idea what moral is), who say it is sick and spoiling; and there are others - incredibly misguided - who think it is negative, black, sad and finishes tragically, without perspective, and without giving an answer, or a hope about the problems depicted.

For the younger set, mostly 10 to 13 year old girls, it would probably be fairly entertaining.The only two girl actors in this movie who appear, now 10 years later, to be on a career track are Schuyler Fisk (Sissy's daughter) as Kristy Thomas and Rachael Leigh Cook as Mary Anne Spier, best friends in this story. Fisk was the right age, 12, during filming, but Cook was 15. She could get by with that because she is so small and young-looking.I have become a fan of sorts of Cook, I think she does a credible job in her more recent movies. However in this movie her acting is very high schoolish. Then, when I looked at her profile, realized this was her very first acting job. She had a lot to learn, and has come along very nicely since then.The only really good character was created by Ellen Burstyn, who was the lady next door, who loved to garden, and ended up with a greenhouse after the summer was over.The movie has a simple premise -- a group of 6 or 7 young teen girls band together to form a baby-sitting club. An adult can call a central number and they book whomever is free that evening. For the summer they decide to form a sort of summer camp for the little kids, they figure they can earn maybe six or 7 thousand dollars. It doesn't quite work out that way, but they do have enough at the end to buy potted plants for the lady next door, and still buy a very large pizza.The movie has the usual cliché' characters, the geeky boys who want the girls' attention, the clueless parents, the mean girls who hang together and plot to mess things up. Directing, camera work, and dialog are all very mediocre.

She could get by with that because she is so small and young-looking.I have become a fan of sorts of Cook, I think she does a credible job in her more recent movies. However in this movie her acting is very high schoolish. Then, when I looked at her profile, realized this was her very first acting job. She had a lot to learn, and has come along very nicely since then.The only really good character was created by Ellen Burstyn, who was the lady next door, who loved to garden, and ended up with a greenhouse after the summer was over.The movie has a simple premise -- a group of 6 or 7 young teen girls band together to form a baby-sitting club.

The film was popular in a few major metro markets, but it proved a box office disappointment overall. Although many regarded it as a failed take-off on such high school angst films as THE BREAKFAST CLUB, more than a few critics saw it as a film too much ahead of its time and predicted that it would have more of an impact down the road. They were right. When the film began to reach the home market it exploded in popularity, and given such later high school horrors as Columbine today the film seems less take-off than downright prophetic.It is also one of the most wickedly funny movies to hit the screen since Stanley Kubrik's DR. STRANGELOVE. The story starts off normally enough extremely bright, extremely attractive Veronica (Winona Ryder) is a high school junior who has fallen in with the high school clique to end all high school cliques, three young women each named Heather (Kim Walker, Lisanne Falk, and Shannen Doherty.) The Heathers are pretty, smart, rich... and intent on shoring up their own social positions by crushing every one around them with a degree of vindictiveness that only the teenagers can successfully carry.When Veronica meets new student J.D. Dean (Christian Slater) her interest in the Heathers begins to wane and they turn on her. J.D. has his own plan to help Veronica get even. It involves a cup of Liquid Drano--and before Veronica can think she finds herself making a murder look like suicide. The result is, as Veronica puts it, teen-age angst with a body count, and quite suddenly suicide seems the in thing at Westerberg High.If you recall high school fondly, you were probably one of the popular kids. For the rest of us, HEATHERS is so accurate that it will make you wince in its portrait of unthinking cruelty the meanness of the up-scale cliques and brainless jocks, the ridiculed good kids, the savage assaults on the unpopular ones. it is bitter, bitter stuff.It is also extremely funny. Much of this is due to a truly brilliant script by Daniel Waters, who recognizes that teens rarely speak to adults in the same way that they speak to each other--and he not only brings forth the casually used profanity, he essentially creates a truly believable and hilariously funny mode of slang that characterizes the in crowd. And Waters' plot is even more disconcerting and outrageously funny as it runs, with unexpected logic, to a truly deadly conclusion.The performances are knockouts. Ryder has given quite a few memorable performances, but she has never been more remarkable than she is here as Veronica, the good girl turned unintentional killer; Christian Slater has never topped the performance he gives here as J.D. The Heathers are perfectly, flawless cast, as is every one from the weary principal to Veronica's vacuous parents. As for direction, Michael Lehmann moves the film at a rapid clip, hitting more high points than you can imagine. Indeed, everything about the film is first-rate.The DVD package is very nice, including an interesting audio commentary, an interesting documentary featuring interviews with director, writer, and major cast members (Kim Walker, who died in 2001, sadly excepted), and a script of the ending as originally planned by writer Waters. I recommend the film as a must have--but a word of warning. If you were one of the very popular during your high school years, you won't find it in the least enjoyable.

With the exception of musicals, which revolve more around singing than dancing, this genre hasn't provided too many highlights. Sure, we have seen highlights with 'Saturday Night Fever' and 'Dirty Dancing', but when Thomas Carter attempted to resurrect a genre lying down to rot, he didn't quite create a film up there to rival the greats.Carter has created a dance film although the overriding genre in the film is romantic drama. The film revolves around Sara (Julia Stiles) a white, well-off teenage girl who is forced to move to a stereotypical black neighbourhood in Chicago following her mother's passing in a car accident. She there meets Chenille (Kerry Washington), a black teenage girl and soon falls for Chenille's brother Derek (Sean Patrick Thomas). The viewers are able to see the struggles Sara goes through to fit in to this neighbourhood where she is a different race, skin colour, gender and class to the other important characters in the film, as well as trying to achieve her dream of being accepted into the lucrative dance school Julliard.Stiles, Washington and Thomas do a very good job in this film and it is refreshing to see such solid performances from actors not quite up there with Hollywood's A-List. It is relieving to see no comedic errors from the cast of 'Save The Last Dance', although at one point, Derek's efforts at motivating Sara are almost laughable as he attempts to sound positive and confident.When you delve deeper into 'Save The Last Dance', it becomes evident which themes Carter was trying to portray his beliefs on to us viewers. Through the character Sara, we are able to see Carter's beliefs on race, gender and class and the struggles and exclusions you can face when you don't fit into the dominant and expected stereotype of the society you are living in. Sara is of a different race, gender and class to the majority of the other characters in the film and as a result, she tries to change herself to be included with, and fit into the society she has moved to in Chicago.

Sara almost completely contradicts this and humiliates the tag-line.In conclusion, I found 'Save The Last Dance' to be enjoyable to watch and I was impressed with the quality of performances displayed from actors not in Hollywood's top group. The film however, did not break any new ground and despite Carter's best effort to resurrect the dance film, this effort will not go down as one of the greats.

Obviously from time to time the searches and the aspirations to get to this perfection can lead to a disaster so perfect, that in it you cannot find anything... GOOD, actually - even if you search with subatomic microscope. Con Air has achieved this perfection to the full, but multiplied by minus one.And yet, you cannot create a nice and decent film only by doing the opposite to what the script-writers, the director, the actors and the producers of Con Air did. You cannot do it simply by multiplying with (-1). Cause there is one thing in Con Air, which equals zero and it is the plot - the vision, the ideas, the messages, which every movie has to have. And as it has no plot and no reasoning, apart from the wish of the its makers to show us unimaginably ridiculous pile of crap that they intended to label an action movie for fun, you see the point when you multiply anything by zero, you will get zero again.The conclusion is clear you cannot make a film without a core, and the core of every film is some kind of an noticeable idea. Only the comedies (and not all of them) are excused of that need, but then it has to be replaced by a continuous number of really good jokes, tricks and comic situations. Take Blue streak as an example what it would be without the lost diamond, or without the main character being black? Only some stupid chases and shootings will remain. But how he tried to retrieve the diamond, and the comic situations that came from it - this is enough to create a good, fun action movie. Just don't take it seriously, when you lack the big idea to tell!The idea is indispensable for a serious movie - so if you don't have what to say to the world, you will never make even the slightest kind of a good non-comedy movie - even with a billion dollar budget at your disposal. In this case - depending on what your social status is - better go wash dishes, or continue to drive your daddy's $200,000 jeep, that he gave you for your birthday. While if you have a good idea and you don't want to spoil it tragically, watch Con Air, and watch it at least 20 times, and oblige everybody from your future film-making team to watch it, cause there - in the most vivid, noticeable and classic way - it is shown HOW NOT TO MAKE A MOVIE. It can also be used as a certain kind of barometer whoever has actually liked it and didn't find how shallow and silly it is, is himself exceptionally stupid. To be more specific, he is more stupid than one hundred thousand sitting ducks, staring at a ticking bomb right in front of them.This film has in it - in compacted and very accessible form - EVERY SINGLE THING THAT YOU HAVE TO AVOID, when you make a movie. The idiotic dialogues; the terribly overexposed, mostly misplaced and pointless effects; the obvious physical impossibility of so many scenes that were supposed to be for real; the irritating, horrible acting of so many of the cast - who probably were contesting for the Triple worst actor Golden Raspberry awards; the infinite clichés - especially this about the innocent convict, who not only has to beat the bad guys, but also the police, the government and the military, which, of course, are not aware of the situation, so unwillingly help the bad ones and handicap the hero - yet he will overcome the difficulties (or rather - the impossibilities) and prevail in the end - and they will arrive only to witness the spoils of his smashing victory, to shake his hand and to apologize that they almost killed him (I'm not sure if the-authority-shakes-hands-and-thanks-the-hero-for-the-good-job scene was in the film, but in the last minutes it had turned into such an omnipotent mess, that my head turned into a pumpkin); and on top of it - the serial child killer, who happened to be so nice person this almost brought me to tears; and so many more - from beginning to end, embroidered in every second of this movie disaster... I actually can't count them all, without breaching the 1000 words limit.Despite all said above, from an ironical point of view Con Air has a value. I gave it the lowest possible rating, because it was the worst movie ever created, but I also have written this comment about it. There are worse films than Con Air, but they are so unnoticeable, they cannot earn even that label - THE WORST MOVIE - as not only me, but nobody would ever watch them. While this one had a relatively prominent cast, Nicolas Cage in first place, and I kept watching it to find how bad it will go, and to see the disaster from the whole perspective. It caught my attention with its HORRIBLE, YET CLASSICAL WEAKNESSES. And what about the actors? What they played is always played by total beginners, not by career actors, and as they are totally unknown, nobody notices the movie also. Yet these ones were moderately well-known in Hollywood, I think. We have to pay them a tribute they destroyed - if not their careers - at least their reputation, in order to give us this classic anti-example of a movie.It is the most vivid, conspicuous film that you have to watch in order to find what kind of films you must never watch.

And as it has no plot and no reasoning, apart from the wish of the its makers to show us unimaginably ridiculous pile of crap that they intended to label an action movie for fun, you see the point when you multiply anything by zero, you will get zero again.The conclusion is clear you cannot make a film without a core, and the core of every film is some kind of an noticeable idea. Only the comedies (and not all of them) are excused of that need, but then it has to be replaced by a continuous number of really good jokes, tricks and comic situations. Take Blue streak as an example what it would be without the lost diamond, or without the main character being black? Only some stupid chases and shootings will remain. But how he tried to retrieve the diamond, and the comic situations that came from it - this is enough to create a good, fun action movie. Just don't take it seriously, when you lack the big idea to tell!The idea is indispensable for a serious movie - so if you don't have what to say to the world, you will never make even the slightest kind of a good non-comedy movie - even with a billion dollar budget at your disposal. In this case - depending on what your social status is - better go wash dishes, or continue to drive your daddy's $200,000 jeep, that he gave you for your birthday. While if you have a good idea and you don't want to spoil it tragically, watch Con Air, and watch it at least 20 times, and oblige everybody from your future film-making team to watch it, cause there - in the most vivid, noticeable and classic way - it is shown HOW NOT TO MAKE A MOVIE. It can also be used as a certain kind of barometer whoever has actually liked it and didn't find how shallow and silly it is, is himself exceptionally stupid. To be more specific, he is more stupid than one hundred thousand sitting ducks, staring at a ticking bomb right in front of them.This film has in it - in compacted and very accessible form - EVERY SINGLE THING THAT YOU HAVE TO AVOID, when you make a movie. The idiotic dialogues; the terribly overexposed, mostly misplaced and pointless effects; the obvious physical impossibility of so many scenes that were supposed to be for real; the irritating, horrible acting of so many of the cast - who probably were contesting for the Triple worst actor Golden Raspberry awards; the infinite clichés - especially this about the innocent convict, who not only has to beat the bad guys, but also the police, the government and the military, which, of course, are not aware of the situation, so unwillingly help the bad ones and handicap the hero - yet he will overcome the difficulties (or rather - the impossibilities) and prevail in the end - and they will arrive only to witness the spoils of his smashing victory, to shake his hand and to apologize that they almost killed him (I'm not sure if the-authority-shakes-hands-and-thanks-the-hero-for-the-good-job scene was in the film, but in the last minutes it had turned into such an omnipotent mess, that my head turned into a pumpkin); and on top of it - the serial child killer, who happened to be so nice person this almost brought me to tears; and so many more - from beginning to end, embroidered in every second of this movie disaster... I actually can't count them all, without breaching the 1000 words limit.Despite all said above, from an ironical point of view Con Air has a value. I gave it the lowest possible rating, because it was the worst movie ever created, but I also have written this comment about it. There are worse films than Con Air, but they are so unnoticeable, they cannot earn even that label - THE WORST MOVIE - as not only me, but nobody would ever watch them. While this one had a relatively prominent cast, Nicolas Cage in first place, and I kept watching it to find how bad it will go, and to see the disaster from the whole perspective.

What they played is always played by total beginners, not by career actors, and as they are totally unknown, nobody notices the movie also.

Then Thirteen Days came along, and dared to break from the mold. This is Kennedy at his finest, and while critics charge that Thirteen Days is just pro-Kennedy propaganda (JFK's nephew even has a role), historical dramas make for more intelligent movie-making than soap operas.Besides an intelligent topic, we have a well assembled cast, with particularly good performances provided by Bruce Greenwood as JFK (who manages to be convincing in spite of bearing no resemblance to any Kennedy, let alone JFK) and Steven Culp (who is making his second appearance as RFK on film, having previously played him in Norma Jean & Marilyn (1997). Unfortunately, I do not have the same feeling about Kevin Costner's performance, and I cannot help but to think of Jim Garrison (his character in JFK (1991)) every time his character, Kenneth O'Donnell, appears. It is as if Garrison had jumped into some time machine so as to better fulfill his obsession with Kennedy. That is the problem with using the same actor for two different roles in two different movies dealing with the same man. Nothing against Costner, he just does not seem to quite fit.Unlike many other films, this movie relies almost entirely on dialogue, with little action or romance, so it is not entertaining in the conventional sense. It is wholly about those conversations that happen behind close doors that shape human history, and much of the drama is played out sitting down.For those equipped for DVDs, that version of this film is especially desirable, for it includes archival footage and interviews which cast further light on the crisis; thirteen days in which the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. came to the brink of war over the U.S.S.R.'s placement of offensive nuclear weapons on the Cuban island. For those who know the outcome, the movie does not reduce the suspense, while those learning about the crisis for the first time receive a valuable lesson in diplomacy and military self-control.

This movie... no matter what critic, no matter how scathing, how cruel and cold... when it comes to movies like this... the press is powerless.Really, who cares what the critics say? This is not the newest political biography by Oliver Stone.Movies like this are just meant to make you laugh. And this one does. But Definitely not enough.I was really looking forward to this one. I was in the mood for a Dumb & Dumber or Kingpin type of comedy and I saw some of the ads for this one and it looked fairly funny. So when it first came out on video, I rushed out to get it.I've enjoyed most of Sandler's stuff, the Farrelly Brothers movies and just about every movie from the comic film firm of Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker. So, surely, I'd like this one.Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo is a vomit bag of a movie. Granted, that's more or less what I was looking for... but it was the WRONG kind of vomit.THE PLOT IN A NUTSHELL Goofy, homely and pathetic fish-tank cleaner Deuce (who's also a fish specialist) winds up playing house-sitter and fish doctor for a luxurious gigolo. Disaster hits (of course) and in a last desperate resort to raise some much needed money very quickly, Deuce becomes a prostitute. And encounters every misfortune possible.Sounds funny, doesn't it? And in the hands of some genuinely talented writers and directors, yes, it damn well could have been. But it's handled so terribly, so clumsy, so over-the-top, the humor dies out quickly and at the end, we lose faith and trust in summer gross-out comedies. And we desperately need those, don't you agree?There's a running joke involving a hard-ass police detective named Chuck Fowler (William Forsythe) who's more or less an unfunny comic take on Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive. David Alan Grier made his work in 3 Strikes, but having him constantly show his penis to Deuce (which is apparently pathetically small. Or at least thin) is just not funny because no one here seems to know how to make it work. Schneider and co-writer Harris Goldberg (D3 The Mighty Ducks, I'll Be Home For Christmas) incorporate a butt-load of funny ideas into this script, but no one here seems to know how to make it work.Director Mike Mitchell does not have the Midas touch when it comes to comedy. Gold, hell, he can't even settle for a bronze PLATING.Everything is so obnoxious, so gross, so overplayed, it'll give you a headache.It wouldn't be fair for me to say that there's no laughs to be had throughout the whole movie and it was totally without ANY merit Oded Fehr is perfectly cast as the experienced smoldering prostitute. And Arija Bareikis is appealing as the love interest. And Schnider occasionally (early on) does deliver a chuckle with his performance.There's a funny bit where an aquarium salesman appears to be either gay or a pervert and continuously makes double-ententes to Duece's confusion. And comedian actor Edddie Griffin (of whom my mother is a huge fan of) gets some of the movie's only laughs (belly-laughs) as a pimp named T.J.T.J.I prefer to be called a male madame. Wait, that didn't sound right. He gets (probably) the movie's biggest laugh when he explains the prostitute food chain to Deuce, using Antoine's fish to illustrate his point.And there are some really funny moments to be had early on and with some of the women Deuce services. Hey, you think the kind of MEN who pay for it are scary. Just imagine the kind of WOMEN who'd have to pay for it. But the movie stops trying less than halfway through and feels like it's on auto-pilot. Not just the director, but everything.Look, I'm gonna say it right here, right now Schnieder is just not a leading man, pure and simple. He does not have the looks, the height, the physique and charisma to carry a whole picture.Even though it seems like this is the kind of lead that's perfect for Schnieder (an ugly, goofy, sexually-repellent man who could never get it for free, let alone be able to charge for it), he just can't quite pull this one off. Although this material (which he's partially responsible for could've derailed anyone).Even if this one contained the best cast in the world, how much good can it do when you're working from a script you found in a condemned, rotting, stinking gas-station men's room on the urine-soaked floor? Look, Rob Schneider is just not the lead, pure and simple. He's the one joke character (You con dew eeet!) and a supporting actor (Judge Dredd, Home Alone 2 Lost in New York, Surf Ninjas and Knock Off). He's just not a head-liner, pure and simple. Co-billing, maybe, MAYBE. He should stop writing movies... or at least stop trying to carry them. Maybe a ensemble vehicle would help.Schnieder was never meant to be an Oscar-contender, I know. But a box-office darling? Now Sandler, I can see, but...Seriously, really... avoid this one. For good gross-out summer comedies, I recommend the following Dumb & Dumber, Kingpin, There's Something About Mary, Scary Movie and the American Pie trilogy. Check out Sandler's Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy and The Longest Yard.

The madness and confusion during the combat scenes bring strong realistic performances, but ultimately, the film fades to an end and loses insight along the way. There is no strong sense of closure or solid setup for a conclusion regarding the characters (as we saw in Platoon).
