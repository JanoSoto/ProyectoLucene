I feel like this is what gets it a lot of attention - aside from the groundbreaking special effects that won audiences over back in the day. The theme of Carl Denham's film within the film is about Beauty and the Beast, which happens to be the theme of King Kong itself.Carl Denham is portrayed as a man who stops at nothing in order to get his shots right, a very devoted director. He comes across as hot- headed and funnier than Jack Black's portrayal in Jackson's version. His character progression reaches its climax with the delivery of the line we've got something worth more than all the movies in the world! Brilliant writing in my opinion.This may seem strange, but what turns me off from this movie a bit is specifically what it is known for - its special effects. I know its effects were groundbreaking for the time the film was released, but I still found them to be distracting, or not very well done. While it is cool that this film portrays giant monsters fighting - a great deal of spectacle - the stop-motion effects take away a lot from whatever reality is portrayed in the film.It also bothers me how this movie is heavily focused on the Beauty and the Beast theme, but there seems to be no sympathy for Kong once beauty killed the beast. So where is there a progression? Character-wise or Kong-wise? Denham realizes that beauty killed the beast, but he does not seem changed at all by this observation. As for Kong, we see him go on a rampage and take the leading lady up to the top of the Empire State Building, but we don't really identify with him at all. While Jackson's version may be too long, at least it portrays a connection between beauty and the beast, and we actually see a motivation for what Kong's actions are.This is still a good movie, but I am not sure whether it should hold such a high spot on American Film Institute's 100 list. It is groundbreaking, yes, but I don't find the effects to be compelling and I don't really identify with any characters in this film.

The globe was in a frenzy once you saw the trailer, wow a NEW Star Wars movie! With such fond memories of the originals you anticipate this movie more than your own Birthday! Then once you bought a ticket, grabbed some sweets and sat down into that dark theater, your dream had come true. Then the movie had finished and you walked out of your local theater, trying to think about what you just saw, and we can tell you one thing.... it wasn't Star Wars! The film isn't that bad itself but it just doesn't feel like a Star Wars movie! It crushed the hopes of millions of geeks and just plain movie-goers over the world, with characters like little Anakin and Jar Jar Binks, you questioned your own judgment, and those two flaws (Jar Jar & Little Ani) alone serve the film a major problem, but we'll try delve even deeper into what ruined this film, or who ruined it (George Lucas). This film suffers from a very bad script, some dialog is OK but some really isn't. The scenes at Coruscant with all those parliament meetings and talks bore the hell out of you! With such big stars like Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor and Samuel L Jackson, why didn't the script utilize them!? Jar Jar Binks is supposed to be comic relief for the kids but this saga really doesn't know what audience it's aiming for, sometimes there's funny scenes even adults and children like but then bring that up that when you see Anakin Skywalker's cut-in-half burning body at the end of Revenge of the Sith. But before we go any further let's address some of the good things about the film The Pod Race, Darth Maul, The Lightsaber Duel and the opening scene where Qui Gon Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi battle the droids. That's about it, and Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan Kenobi is perfect, but he spends most of the film in a ship on Tatooine just talking, yeah... This is how that masterful Jedi Guardian in A New Hope started out! Now we come to Jar Jar Binks and Little Anakin Skywalker. Jar Jar is just really annoying, he makes tasteless jokes throughout the whole film, why he's even in most of the film is beyond us! Why did George even put him here, did he seriously think the audience would find this character funny, well maybe for three year-old's but that's it! If you watch the movie over the years you'll find you just get used to him and can let him pass but little Anakin is where things get serious. The whole point of this prequel trilogy is to show how Anakin Skywalker transforms into Darth Vader, and this is how it began........ One of cinemas most iconic villains begins off as a poorly acted character who says such lines as yippee. As a kid I imagined him to be lean and blunt, but still a good kid deep down. It's hard to get interested in the movie when you see this kids (Jake Lloyd's) acting, you can tell its unrealistic, taking you out of the moment. The plot's also got a few errors in it, did Darth Sidious want the Jedi to be killed at the beginning or not? If he's been planning his eventual victory at the end of Revenge of the Sith since this movie, why would he want Obi Wan or Qui Gonn dead if they're the key element to finding Anakin Skywalker. Or did he know that they'd survive the separatists' droid attack, who knows..! Talk about lazy directing, George Lucas wasn't even thinking when he wrote the script, now we don't think he did it for merchandising purposes, we truly believe he did it because he loved his franchise. But the writing is so bad in this one, Viceroy Gunray orders his droids to destroy what's left of them regarding Qui Gonn and Obi Wan at the start of the film, after injecting a toxic gas into their room. By destroying what was left of the Jedi did he mean for the battle droids to shoot their corpses!? It's just a pointless error that could have been removed. One more good thing about the film are in fact the battle droids, their subtle humor and design makes us like them more than Clone Troopers. Anyway, here is EMC's review on chronologically the first in The Star Wars saga. It's OK but just fails in a lot of areas, like the discovery of Anakin and how it didn't have a main character which was supposed to be Obi Wan Kenobi. George's stunning visuals in the film prove that he adds more style than substance. There's all these neat action scenes but it means nothing if we're not invested in the actual film.

It stars Will Smith (who also recorded the famous title song) and Tommy Lee Jones. But the highlight for me was probably Vincent D'Onofrio playing a huge bug. Total scene stealer and I'm also a great fan of him in Criminal Intent and everywhere else. The script was okay all in all, but I have to say I did not find Smith particularly funny. Tommy Lee Jones was not supposed to be funny, apart from very few very subtle scenes. He is a great actor, but it's difficult to appreciate such a serious character in a film which really has no dramatic ambition and only comedic purpose. Somehow the whole background story (past battles, deleting memories, aliens living among us, Smith's recruitment challenge...) and world they created was more interesting than the actual plot of trying to catch and kill D'Onofrio's character.The movie runs for 90 minutes and so far there have been already 2 sequels. These weren't rushed though. There was a break of five years to movie number 2 and even 10 years to movie number 3. I wonder if the fourth will come out in 20 years time. Just kidding. It's already planned, so it will certainly not be that long, probably 5 years max. We will see if director Barry Sonnenfeld returns just like he did for the two sequels. He also worked with Smith in Wild, Wild West. However, there were also some plot weaknesses in this film here. Why would they recruit a complete newbie in the profession to save the world with TLJ's character. They must have a more experienced guy for that right? Or maybe did the monsters attack because the former partner retired and they wanted to make use of the occasion? And why would TLJ's character also retire at the end of the film. Maybe too much responsibility for Smith's character still in my opinion. Why is everybody retiring? Okay, the first guy was pretty old, but TLJ not really. Unfortunately, I was not too big on Linda Fiorentino's character. Her inclusion really only seemed with the purpose to have at least one female character in the movie, but I did not feel she contributed much to the story. Anyway, Will Smith reminded me of a young Eddie Murphy in this film, although that is almost a bit of an unfair comparison as Smith is not much younger actually, but just seems very juvenile for his age.This comic-based movie was made right after the end of Fresh Prince and propelled Smith into stardom on the big screen also. It won the Best Makeup award (Rick Baker the legend) at the Oscars that year (a lot of it thanks to D'Onofrio's bug I'm sure) and scored two more nominations. Actually, I would not have minded a screenplay nomination for Ed Solomon either. Especially the dialogs were really well-written. All in all I recommend this film although pretty much everybody probably has seen it by now. It's an interesting comedy and even with the scary setting of losing the earth to monsters and some killings happening (not graphically), it is all very light and should really harm nobody except very small children. It came out in the year when Titanic sunk everything else at the award shows and box office. But I still believe Men in Black is the better film even if it only came in second at the box office and did not even reach half of Titanic's money. Watch it.

There's movies with disturbing content and brutality that will make the viewer uneasy. Saving Private Ryan is a good example of that. Then there's extremely complex movies that require full attention and lots of analyzing in order to comprehend. The Thin Red Line is an excellent example of that. Overly complex movies are often well liked, but Red Line caught a bad rap since it came out at the wrong time.The Thin Red Line is overshadowed by Steven Spielberg's masterpiece, Saving Private Ryan. Both Private Ryan and Red Line are phenomenal works, but in different perspectives. I actually prefer this to Private Ryan, (ever so slightly more) as it is a thinking man's movie. But my opinion may change. I would actually call this my second favourite war movie ever (behind Apocalypse Now). Spielberg's directing of Saving Private Ryan is nothing short of majestic. He makes the battles look like first person points of view and makes the viewer feel like they are in it themselves. The horrors of war are shown very well, but the general story is absurd and the emotional factor is clichéd. Red Line's battles are inferior to Private Ryan's, but the emotional factor and many other plot and filming devices surpass Private Ryan's.The Thin Red Line provides different narrations to gives an inside look at these soldiers. That is a brilliant move. They are forced to go to war and must face the horrors. Private Ryan is by far the scariest war film ever, but it is patriotic. Red Line goes back to basics and uses the same formula as Apocalypse Now and Platoon do how war can change people. But Red Line distinguishes itself from those by using more symbolism and philosophy. Jim Caviezel is our main character who is AWOL living in a peaceful Indian village who is taken by Sean Penn to partake in the Battle of Guadalcanal. There is a scene later on in the film where he is back with the tribe and there is tension among everyone. I never understood if the whole experience with the tribe was a hallucination or not, but they do symbolize the negativity that the world has. The battle starts with them getting up a hill battling the Japanese. The higher they get on the hill, the worse everything gets for them. While this movie is going on, there's lots of lovely shots of nature. Nature provides a relationship to the soldiers, both comparing and contrasting. There's nice imaging of the nature-filled areas and the nice sunlight, and there's a crocodile that enters a pond (pretty much a threshold) then we see just its head later on.

The performances are more than adequate, the attention to period detail and the cinematography is breathtaking at times. The problem lies with the screenplay, and the editing (it seems that MGM saw fit to trim the original cut of the film down to a more acceptable running time), leaving much to be desired with character development (or lack thereof) and plot holes.The opening sequence is pure noir, or neo-noir as the genre that it falls into. The Hat Squad in which Max Hoover (Nick Nolte) is the leader is both comical and interesting. Unfortunately, the other characters (Chazz Palminteri, and particularly Michael Madsen and Chris Penn) are give little to do by comparison. And although Jennifer Connelly is featured prominently in the trailer and on the DVD cover, she also has very little do but look gorgeous and sexy (which she does very well) in a series of all too brief flashbacks and 8mm footage. Melanie Griffith, as Hoover's wronged wife, makes the most of her limited screen time but again, the film could have benefited from seeing more of her (and I say this as someone who is not particularly a fan, but she is extremely sympathetic and likable here). Andrew McCarthy gets the thankless role as the friend of Allison Pond (Connelly) who knows too much. John Malkovich seems to think he's in another movie, Treat Williams tries hard but never fully convinces as a military man. Blink and you'll miss Rob Lowe in a cameo and William Peterson is uncredited.The main problem with Muholland Falls is that it does feel like two movies slapped together. The military\/government angle felt very out of place; what started off as a promising detective story dealing with the murder of a young woman who has connections to both the police force and the corrupt underworld of Los Angeles turns into a bland maze of incoherent and uninteresting plot points.Some may argue that this attempt at neo-noir is unjustly compared to Chinatown (1974) and L.A. Confidential (1997), but it does fall short. As I mentioned before, perhaps the editing is to blame. It would be interesting if a director's cut exists. Perhaps that would make more sense out of the plot.Dave Grusin's score is nice enough, but only briefly evokes the feeling associated with the genre.In conclusion, Muholland Falls is not a waste of time, it was an interesting premise that simply ran out of steam.

After three years since the original let-down, we find out that this one won't include Jar Jar Binks as a central character, or won't have an irritating ten year old who'll play Anakin Skywalker, we even see a glimpse of what could be everyone's favorite bounty hunter, Boba Fett! We all reassure ourselves that Star Wars would get better now, and stay true to that classic style we all cherished. But the same thing with The Phantom Menace occurred again, most fans didn't like the movie for reasons we'll explain throughout this review. This movie, like The Phantom Menace suffers from a bad script, though not as bad as The Phantom Menace's. Firstly the dialog between Obi Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker in the elevator scene at the start of the film. It's a nice little bit where the two exchange words about their previous adventures together and show a friendship. Though we as an audience don't know what they're talking about because we haven't seen those adventures. George Lucas can't just simply explain to us that in that one minute scene that they're friends, you have to show it in the actual movie, like they did with the Lethal Weapon franchise. Like when Martin Riggs reminds Roger about the time he was stuck to a toilet in case a bomb went off in part 2, the two smile remembering that bizarre moment and we as an audience remember it too, relating to the friendship. Here the script takes one short scene in an elevator to tell us that the two are friends because... They were meant to be good friends according to Obi Wan's story to Luke in Episode IV. Then for the rest of the movie they do there own separate things showing concentration in the wrong area. Obi Wan's off finding this Clone Army on the planet Kamino and Anakin's on Naboo protecting Padme from an assassination. Now people criticize the film for Anakin's (Hayden Christensen's) acting performance in the film, but this is a false claim. The actor does very well if the right script is given to him, the bad acting is a result of poor direction by George Lucas. For some reason the love story dialog between Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) and Anakin is so horrible because... Of the way Hayden Christensen says the lines!? Almost every character in this movie has to say stupid lines too, why does all the critique come down upon Hayden!? Although Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan makes his lines sound much better, seeing that he is in fact a better actor. Now another reason why everyone dislikes this movie is in fact for the love story, they say it's awkward and forced but we say it's beautiful though very clichéd. There really is no problem with the love story other than it's clichéd as hell, and that great John Williams score doesn't help either! But with all the beautiful backdrops and locations, who cares, we think it's perfect how Anakin and Padme fall in love. The movie also uses too much CGI, but it makes for some thrilling action scenes, this movie has he best actions scenes out of the whole entire saga. It's got the Bounty Hunter chase through Coruscant, Obi Wan VS Jango Fett, the Jedi Battlle in that arena, the beginning of the Clone Wars, and Yoda's epic light saber duel. Although Yoda having a light saber totally clashes with everything he stands for in Episode V, it's still pretty cool to see him whipping out and wielding his very own light saber. Then Jango Fett, the father of Boba is also a very cool addition to the Star Wars Saga, we maybe even prefer him to Boba, just for his awesome battle with Mace Windu on Geonosis. It is also interesting to see Chancellor Palpatine take his first step into becoming the Emperor in one of the ending scenes, as he controls the Clone Army. Another great thing about the film is Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, back in his old comic self again. But another major flaw is the brief relationship between Anakin and Owen Lars. At the end of Revenge of the Sith he receives the child of his stepbrother (Anakin) from a guy he didn't even know (Obi Wan). Anyway, comparing these positives, Attack of the Clones is a thrilling space adventure film featuring new awesome planets we love like Kamino and Geonosis. It pushes the action to new heights, and is our personal favorite of the saga, making it number one. Though for some reason George Lucas writes Anakin as a bad apple. Anakin is not much like Luke Skywalker at all, for he is not totally being a good guy in this film, this is seen after his mothers death when he mindlessly slaughters countless Tusken Raiders.

","genre":null},{"date":"7 March 2015","score":"6 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Star Wars Episode II Attack Of The Clones is the eagerly anticipated sequel to Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace. After three years since the original let-down, we find out that this one won't include Jar Jar Binks as a central character, or won't have an irritating ten year old who'll play Anakin Skywalker, we even see a glimpse of what could be everyone's favorite bounty hunter, Boba Fett! We all reassure ourselves that Star Wars would get better now, and stay true to that classic style we all cherished. But the same thing with The Phantom Menace occurred again, most fans didn't like the movie for reasons we'll explain throughout this review. This movie, like The Phantom Menace suffers from a bad script, though not as bad as The Phantom Menace's. Firstly the dialog between Obi Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker in the elevator scene at the start of the film. It's a nice little bit where the two exchange words about their previous adventures together and show a friendship. Though we as an audience don't know what they're talking about because we haven't seen those adventures. George Lucas can't just simply explain to us that in that one minute scene that they're friends, you have to show it in the actual movie, like they did with the Lethal Weapon franchise. Like when Martin Riggs reminds Roger about the time he was stuck to a toilet in case a bomb went off in part 2, the two smile remembering that bizarre moment and we as an audience remember it too, relating to the friendship. Here the script takes one short scene in an elevator to tell us that the two are friends because... They were meant to be good friends according to Obi Wan's story to Luke in Episode IV. Then for the rest of the movie they do there own separate things showing concentration in the wrong area. Obi Wan's off finding this Clone Army on the planet Kamino and Anakin's on Naboo protecting Padme from an assassination. Now people criticize the film for Anakin's (Hayden Christensen's) acting performance in the film, but this is a false claim. The actor does very well if the right script is given to him, the bad acting is a result of poor direction by George Lucas. For some reason the love story dialog between Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) and Anakin is so horrible because... Of the way Hayden Christensen says the lines!? Almost every character in this movie has to say stupid lines too, why does all the critique come down upon Hayden!? Although Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan makes his lines sound much better, seeing that he is in fact a better actor. Now another reason why everyone dislikes this movie is in fact for the love story, they say it's awkward and forced but we say it's beautiful though very clichéd. There really is no problem with the love story other than it's clichéd as hell, and that great John Williams score doesn't help either! But with all the beautiful backdrops and locations, who cares, we think it's perfect how Anakin and Padme fall in love. The movie also uses too much CGI, but it makes for some thrilling action scenes, this movie has he best actions scenes out of the whole entire saga. It's got the Bounty Hunter chase through Coruscant, Obi Wan VS Jango Fett, the Jedi Battlle in that arena, the beginning of the Clone Wars, and Yoda's epic light saber duel. Although Yoda having a light saber totally clashes with everything he stands for in Episode V, it's still pretty cool to see him whipping out and wielding his very own light saber. Then Jango Fett, the father of Boba is also a very cool addition to the Star Wars Saga, we maybe even prefer him to Boba, just for his awesome battle with Mace Windu on Geonosis. It is also interesting to see Chancellor Palpatine take his first step into becoming the Emperor in one of the ending scenes, as he controls the Clone Army. Another great thing about the film is Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, back in his old comic self again. But another major flaw is the brief relationship between Anakin and Owen Lars. At the end of Revenge of the Sith he receives the child of his stepbrother (Anakin) from a guy he didn't even know (Obi Wan). Anyway, comparing these positives, Attack of the Clones is a thrilling space adventure film featuring new awesome planets we love like Kamino and Geonosis. It pushes the action to new heights, and is our personal favorite of the saga, making it number one. Though for some reason George Lucas writes Anakin as a bad apple. Anakin is not much like Luke Skywalker at all, for he is not totally being a good guy in this film, this is seen after his mothers death when he mindlessly slaughters countless Tusken Raiders. And when he attempts to run at the movies' villain with a light saber with hate and anger!

After killing a man in a fight Bill, a Chicago steel mill worker, is forced to flee with his girlfriend Abby and his young sister Linda to Texas, where they find work on a farm. To prevent gossip, and possibly to throw the police off the scent should they ever come investigating that killing in Chicago, Bill and Abby pretend that they are brother and sister. Bill learns that their new employer, who is clearly a wealthy man, has been diagnosed with an unspecified terminal illness and has been given only a short time to live. (We never learn his name; he is simply referred to as the farmer). He is clearly also attracted to Abby. Bill therefore encourages Abby to marry him so that she can inherit his money when he dies. The plan, however, misfires. The diagnosis turns out to have been mistaken, the farmer's health improves, or at any rate does not deteriorate, and Abby starts to fall for the man she has married. When the farmer realises the truth about Bill and Abby's relationship, the inevitable result is tragedy. Days of Heaven was Terrence Malick's second feature film, following Badlands from 1973. (His third, The Thin Red Line, was not to appear for another twenty years). The title is enigmatic; given the tragic nature of the storyline it may simply be ironic, as life proves far from heavenly for Bill, Abby and the farmer. It may, however, be a hidden reference to the feature for which the film has become famous. The Texas Panhandle is a flat, featureless area, yet as photographed by Malick and his cinematographer Nestor Almendros it becomes a land of startling, almost heavenly, beauty. This is one of those films where virtually every shot looks like a carefully composed painting. (There are too many striking images to single any out). The farmer's house was based upon the building depicted in Edward Hopper's The House by the Railroad. (This painting also inspired Norman Bates' home in Hitchcock's Psycho, a film about as different in style from Days of Heaven as one could imagine). The views of the fields, with their muted palette of brown, grey, black and beige, are reminiscent of the work of Andrew Wyeth, and those scenes shot at dawn or dusk, as many were, have something of the look of a picture by Jean-Francois Millet. The action takes place in the years 1915-17, and traction engines and other farm machinery of the period are much in evidence. As in Badlands there are few bright colours other than the blue of the noonday sky and the reds and golds of morning and evening. The visual effects are complemented by a fine musical score; the use of Aquarium from Camille Saint-Saëns's Carnival of the Animals seems particularly appropriate to the mood of the film. When the film first came out in 1978 it was not a great success, although many critics praised its visual beauty and Almendros won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography. (Even this was controversial because Almendros had to leave to work on another project after shooting overran and Haskell Wexler, who took over from him, received no recognition. Wexler's work is visible in the Chicago scenes, which are different in style to the rest of the film). It was not, however, nominated for Best Picture and was not a great commercial success. A common criticism was that the storyline was too thin and the emotions too muted. Roger Ebert put forward an ingenious defence of the film, claiming that it is really about Linda rather than about Bill and Abby and that we do not feel the full passion of the adults because it is not her passion. This is certainly one possible reading, although probably not one that will command universal support. I think, however, that there are other possible explanations for this seeming lack of passion. Bill, as played by Richard Gere, is a cold, passionless man whose only thoughts are for himself. The farmer, as played by Sam Shepard, is a shy, reticent man who has difficulty expressing his feelings in an age when stress was placed on keeping a stiff upper lip. Abby, caught between two men, is afraid to reveal too much of herself to either. The muted emotions, therefore, struck me as entirely appropriate to the film's period and theme. Since it first appeared Days of Heaven has become regarded as one of the greatest films of the 1970s; in my view it was the greatest film of 1978. (It would certainly have deserved a Best Picture nomination more than something like Coming Home, which was essentially nominated as an expression of regret for the Vietnam War). It formed part of a movement in the 1970s towards greater lyricism and poeticism in the mainstream cinema, not just in specialist arthouse movies; other films within this movement would include Nicolas Roeg's Walkabout and Don't Look Now, Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock and Cimino's The Deer Hunter, the film which actually won Best Picture in 1978. Allen's Manhattan was to show that this style could be adapted to black-and-white as well as colour films. My view of the film would best be summed up in the words of the critic Dave Kehr who called it a story of human lives touched and passed over by the divine and a film that hovers just beyond our grasp&#x97;mysterious, beautiful, and, very possibly, a masterpiece- except that I would substitute definitely for Kehr's very possibly. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 March 2015","score":"","review":" The plot of this film could be taken from a Thomas Hardy story translated to America.

One day she reads in the paper that Susan is meeting her boyfriend Jimmy in the city and decides to go to the city to actually see what Susan looks like and possibly meet her. Just as Susan arrives on the scene (unbeknownst to her or Roberta, she is being tailed by a killer), Roberta hits her head, wakes up and thinks she's Susan and that's where the fun really begins.To try and explain further would be confusing and totally ruin this delicious romantic comedy for those who have never seen it. Susan Seidelman's direction is crisp and detail-oriented and the screenplay by Leora Barish is absolutely brilliant and the real star of the film...the unpredictable twists and turns this story takes are too numerous to count, but be warned that this is one of those rare gems of a movie where if you walk away for five minutes without pausing it, you won't have a clue as to what's going on.Arquette gives a star-making performance as Roberta and she is well supported by Madonna, in her first major film role, as Susan, a character who is pretty much just a fictionalized version of Madonna herself so the character doesn't really come off as much of a stretch for her.

What this movie really tries to emphasize is that history repeats itself and that we create our own destiny.

After picking up the signal, the crew realize that a dangerous alien species has stowed away on their ship.I may be the minority in in this, as I believe this film lacks the excitement and intrigue of its direct sequel, Aliens. Much of the first half of the movie is very slow and any alien action doesn't take place until a good 45-60 minutes in. However, the suspense does build somewhat when the alien is found on board and the crew members struggle to fend it off and survive. I actually saw all the sequels before I've watched the original, so it was interesting to see how the facehuggers, alien impregnation and the very first alien creature were introduced and explained in the movie.Ridley Scott did do quite a nice job directing, keep the film eerie, dark and foreboding, perfect for a sci-fi movie that takes place in outer-space. Jerry Goldsmith's music score is quite thrilling and Derek Vanlint's cinematography work is brilliant.Most of the characters were OK in their acting, nothing that blew me away. However, Weaver's performance as Ripley is the highlight of the movie, displaying her fearless and commanding attitude while trying to take control of the ship and take on the alien.Overall, though, the film thought quite iconic, this film is not as captivating as Aliens and I thought ***spoiler ahead*** the alien creature does not even have much screen time and you can't see it very well ***spoiler ends***.

Sounds like the first movie.Burn marks on the shark's face, a shark hunting down teenagers on boat trip, etc. JAWS 2 adds nothing new to the concept after all, except Brody and the audience learns that sharks are not only attracted by blood, but by noises, too.Calling JAWS 2 not a great movie would be right. Calling it a bad movie would be wrong. At least it gets the story going all the time.
