What's not to like?  It's a hilarious comedy, one that still gets me cracking up today after having seen if hundreds of times.  Everyone in my family quotes lines from it, and it's great fun.  The ingenious comedy cast really makes the film soar, from Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd, to Rick Moranis and Harold Ramis.  It was also nice to see Sigourney Weaver in a role other than Ripley from the Alien movies.  And the special effects, my God, the effects are absolutely incredible, regardless of what anybody says!  Some of them you can tell how they did them, but they still look good, while others simply amaze me!  This and all the other combined talents of comedy make Ghostbusters a delightful special effects comedy!  I grew up with Ghostbusters.  My friends and I obsessed about it, and played Ghostbusters with toy proton-packs and traps.  I watched The Real Ghostbusters every day, and it remains my favorite cartoon.  I remember getting Ghostbusters as a Christmas gift when I was about 5 years old.  That copy has since faded out, but I still watched it, almost every day when my friends came over.  I only wish I could've seen it in theaters(I might have seen it there, but I was too young to remember). Last weekend, I purchased the Collector's DVD, and I must say, for Ghostbusters fans, and for those who just want to have a good time, it is a must!  It has loads of extras, a video commentary as opposed to an audio commentary, and deleted scenes, including a particularly weird scene in which Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd play street bums instead of Ray Stanz and Pete Venkman.

The special effects never looked better(well, maybe in the theaters it looked best)!Ghostbusters remains a phenomenon of special effects and incredible hilarity!  Unfortunately, the re-uniting of the ghostbusters in Ghostbusters 2 didn't quite have the same magic of the first film, but I still liked it.

I had low expectations before watching this movie; afterall, it's based on a Dean R. Koontz novel. Somehow, Phantoms managed to go below them.The reason was probably the storyline. It was so insipid and strange and dumb, my friend and I talked throughout the whole movie. But we did like how Patsy Cline's I fall to pieces fit in. That's one of the few things we remember about the movie, besides getting creeped out at the thought of the monster coming out of the sink.As for the actors... This is the kind of role Ben Affleck would gladly forget, something he can omit from his resume, thanks to great work done in Good Will Hunting and Dogma.... Rose McGowan's character should have died---her character was there just to ask dumb questions, in case the audience didn't understand what was going on. Huh? Not only did her character act annoying, her face was a bit distracting because it had a glossy sheen... Peter O'Toole was probably cast in this movie because of Supergirl.... Liev Schreiber had the best character, hands down, because he kept singing that Patsy Cline tune.And as for the reason why I watched this movie in the first place... Oh, poor, poor Joanna... How were they able to make this hauntingly ethereal creature just look plain haunting? Throughout the whole movie, it looked like she needed to lie down and sleep... Also, on the videotape cover, Joanna's hair is long and straight. In the movie, it is short and curly. What's up with that? That's got to be the third videotape cover I've seen that has this kind of discrepancy with Joanna's hair.

There are no forced feelings in this film.  Lasse Halstrom  guides a talented cast through a great script and makes it so easy for us to identify with the  characters on the screen.  Michael Caine delivers a great performance and manages to make his  role both comical, and tragic.  Tobey Maguire and Charlize Theron shine as two young people  falling in love, and you can tell that there is chemistry between them, and you can feel the pain  of what each must do at the end of the film.  The film is about finding yourself and realizing  that you don't have to go very far to find out where your family is.  The Cider House Rules  slowly creeps up on you and envelops you into a story that is heartwarming, funny, and sad.   Truly, a great film that will leave you with moist eyes.

And he still can't speak coherent English. It seems he and the female lead are having a battle of the impenetrable accents. Arnie does nothing but lay on pathetic one liners one after the other. How could a good actor like Yahpet Kotto get mixed up in this mess?A decent idea about violent entertainment being used to supress the masses is turned into just another ultra lame-0, macho posturing BS movie from the worst decade known to man. At least Richard Dawson is funny here, parodying his old Family Feud stint as the ultimate game show host. As one reviewer pointed put, you would be better served to watch Death Race 2000 which at least has a witty, blackly comical script.
