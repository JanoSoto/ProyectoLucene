With enough understanding of history, one can imagine it, and, sadly, with the remnants of racism, it might not be too difficult.The tricky part is that with society changing so quickly, each year of the Sixties was culturally distinct. (The only thing that might come close would be the Forties, because of the war and post-war period.) By 1967, this movie was undoubtedly shocking for some, particularly the older generation. But for me, a white teen, it seemed a natural expression of the way the world should be, if not today, within the next decade. And the world, for the most part, did change.I think many intelligent people began to treat interracial marriage and relationships with at least polite respect and tolerance, if not full approval. And some of that change could be traced to this movie. Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is a classic example of how Hollywood movies have helped give social change a nudge or shove.As I recall, the most surprising element of this movie was how strongly the blacks objected to the marriage, particularly Tillie and Mr. Prentice. With all the struggle for equal rights, I expected them to applaud the engagement. Part of it, as shown in the movie, was the embedded sense of inequality, part was the knowledge, which I in my naiveté lacked, of what could happen, not just hateful racism, but possibly murder. But as Poitier says to his father, he doesn't think of himself as black, but as a man. That, not simply equal rights, was the true goal.The movie was not such a shock because earlier movie had already broken the color barrier, and there already was some integration on TV shows. Poitier had played a key role, starting in 1958 with The Defiant Ones.But more important was Lilies of the Field in 1963, which I remember seeing with my parents, not the most liberal people in the world. Yet how could anyone not like and admire Poitier as Homer Smith? And here was a black actor playing a man, not a black man. There was almost no reference to race in the movie. It is a beautiful, moving film, and can be seen on youtube.By 1967, America had made significant progress in moving away from racism, at least outside of the Deep South. In 1967, there was a wonderful optimism in the air that reasonable people could create a better society, reflected in this movie. But by 1969, with the election of Nixon, some politicians began to stir up racial animosity, a tactic we have seen revived in the past decade. I don't think America ever fully regained that optimism, and now it is nearly dead.So this movie is less about shock, than about expressing hope for an ideal of inequality where people, regardless of race, would think of themselves simply as people, and be viewed by others as simply people. Despite all the problems in America and some lingering racism, as well as animosity towards Hispanics because of the illegal alien problem, many people have reached such a race-neutral attitude. Some of that is reflected in the election of Barack Obama, which was eerily predicted by a remark in the film.The acting is great all around, though it had more impact the first time I saw it. Stanley Kramer wisely avoided over-dramatizing it; now I see the subtleties of the performances. Poitier is the center of the story, and his portrayal gives it believability.Spencer Tracy's performance is the most challenging, because he must go through some complex, difficult changes. His final speech is a blow to the gut of racism. It is one of the great finales of a film career, along with Burt Lancaster's disappearing into the corn field.I was puzzled to see that this was the first film role for Katharine Houghton, because she looked the classic American actress of the 50s and 60s. Then it dawned on me, she reminded me of Hope Lange, particularly her role in Pocketful of Miracles. There is a point where Hepburn is about to break the bad news to her, but is interrupted, which echoes a scene in Capra's Miracles. Houghton conveys the same innocent purity as Lange; interestingly, both were raised in Connecticut, as was Hepburn.And then there is Isabel Sanford. What would the movie be without her portrayal of cynicism and fury? It brings the story back to reality and gives it a gravitas that otherwise might be lost in a saccharine ending of sweetness and light. Cecil Kellaway shows what race neutrality looks like from a white, that it is genuinely possible, and not just some cant or platitudes. I had recently watched him as the psychiatrist in Harvey. They are two quite distinct performances, the mark of a fine actor.Younger viewers might dismiss this movie as ancient history. It holds up well because of the tensions in the complex interplay among the characters, and how they are resolved. It is good to watch this to understand where we were and how far we have come. It is good for foreigners to watch this to learn from our mistakes, and to see how we worked to correct them.But most of all, it is good to watch this movie to remember a time of optimism when there was no problem too great that we could not solve if we worked together as reasonable people. Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is a great movie that deserves a place among the classics as long as people are around to watch movies.

They ran into characters that shaped their lives, Marla Hooch (Megan Cavanagh), Ernie Capadino (Jon Lovitz), Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks), and many more, along the way that allowed these two women grow from bickering sisters to in the end respected equals. The theme of this movie is sibling rivalry and how no matter where you are or what you have done in life at some point in time siblings must become equals. This theme reflects the type of theme you could find in such films as Lion King and Thor where that rivalry spurs a tumultuous relationship.Dottie Henson was always the toast of the small town that these two girls grew up in, and until a scout, Ernie Capadino, discovered Dottie for the new professional women's baseball league forming due to the war it looked like the two girls would forever live in the small town and Kit forever in Dottie's shadow. As they became Rockford Peaches and grew together through this league and the bonding found within the team there were still moments where Kit felt constantly outdone by the star of the league her big sister Dottie. Dottie was constantly favored by their coach and her friend Jimmy Dugan as well as the man running the league itself Ira Lowenstein (David Strathairn).This theme and conflict ultimately ends up with a fight between the sisters where Kit gets traded to Racine, but as you will find out after viewing the film Kit may end up getting the last laugh. Ultimately the women end up respecting one another and Kit feels vindicated and can truly consider Dottie a sister and a friend instead of something in her life holding her back.There are moments where the techniques used by the filmmakers allow the viewer to get a great glimpse into what the sisters are feeling towards one another. In the final game of their series to determine the champion of the league, in the heat of the game the director decides to constantly go to close-ups of both Dottie and Kit as they are facing off in this battle of wills. The viewer can see the confidence, yet sympathy of Dottie as she feels for her sister and all of her trials. The viewer also can see the fear of losing in Kit's face, but this fear is accompanied by a raw determination. The other element of film that brought this theme to life was the intense dialogue brought to us in a phenomenal script. In one scene where Kit has been traded the big argument takes place, and with the dialogue accompanied by tremendous performances by Geena Davis and Lori Petty the viewer is watching such an intense and raw moment that you can actually feel Kit's desperation and Dottie's anger and frustration.This film set in the backdrop of an upside-down era of World War II speaks to millions of children and young adults going through this very same theme in their lives. Sibling rivalry is something most families go through in our society and A League of Their Own portrays in a wonderfully made film how siblings can and should overcome these issues so they can become friends and respected peers. With love and respect the most strained relationship can be mended as long as the two individuals are willing to put their differences aside and embrace what makes them two great people and A League of Their Own illustrates that in an entertaining film for all.

Of course, even at the time of its release back in '82 there was skepticism toward it. Headed by horror legends George A. Romero and Stephen King, people seem to forget this movie exists to do one thing and one thing only celebrate the macabre and the sick. Note the title itself you douches consider their taste in film to be of the upper crust. Creepshow doesn't have the nihilistic undertone of Romero's usual work or King's expected psychological torture because it is meant to simply be a fun experience.If you're a horror buff, you know Romero has long credited the classic EC horror comics of the 50s (e.g. Tales From the Crypt) as his inspiration. This is basically the whole point of the film; to feel like a comic book brought to life. Hence, things are bound to be marvelously over-the-top in some regards. One of the best things about this film, to me its strongest aspect in general, is its visual style. It angles many shots as if they were cut outs from a comic, there is some awesome usage of hand drawn animation (I LOVE the opening credit scene) and there is some BAD-ASS use of extreme lighting shifts. To put this in perspective, one second the room is darkly lit but not out of the ordinary per say. Next thing you know the room and all its objects are bathed in a blood-like red, making the photography so well done in this picture.Another aspect you have to embrace in order to fully appreciate the film is its tone. As I said before, this isn't aiming to be cryptic and challenging like let's say The Shining (which King also wrote) or as realistic and seriously-toned as Night of the Living Dead. If anything this movie is a blend of horror and comedy. Thing is it's a brand of comedy most people to this day don't get the dirty guilty pleasure of black humor. A zombie who wants his Father's Day Cake, a hillbilly assuming a meteorite will fetch him a mere $200, a man feeding his nagging-boozed up wife to a snarling beast; the tales drip with not just blood but a comical yet stinging look at banal archetypes.And the cast, let me tell ya, is damn good. It's not like they're handing out Academy Award winning lines, but the acting is pretty well done. Tom Atkins is pretty great as the abusive father, Viveca Lindfore (Bedelia) was awesome and who can forget Mr. King himself as Jordy Verrill? Ted Danson, Fritz Weaver, Hal Holbrook (YES), E.G. Marshall and the always-stunning Adrienne Barbeau do spectacular jobs. My favorite performance would just have to be Leslie Nielsen. He was pretty awesome, let's face it.Topping all this off is one of my favorite horror film scores by none other than John Harrison. He also composed for Romero's 1985 film Day of the Dead. Synthesizers and pianos, not to mention an eerie chorus, the music is just great. And the effects work of Tom Savini, as always, astounds. From creating the walking dead (no pun intended), to vicious crated-yeti&#x97;beast to a horde of disgusting cockroaches, he excels in his line of work.Creepshow is a damn classic and should be eternally revered by all means. My only gripe is that the U.S. DVD is crap seeing as it contains no special features aside a trailer. I haven't seen a DVD with this little effort since Sony Tristar released those awful '50th Anniversary special edition' Godzilla DVDs. If you truly appreciate horror, and as I intend to do, buy yourself a copy of the Region 2 DVD which comes with behind the scenes material, commentaries and interviews with the masters behind the masterpiece. And trust me, Region 2 DVDs should play on most blu-ray and DVD players. My region 2 Godzilla DVDs perform just fine on both.Where's my Father's Day Cake? ","genre":null},{"date":"24 July 2012","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I can't believe this movie only ranks at a 6.6 on IMDb. Of course, even at the time of its release back in '82 there was skepticism toward it. Headed by horror legends George A. Romero and Stephen King, people seem to forget this movie exists to do one thing and one thing only celebrate the macabre and the sick. Note the title itself you douches consider their taste in film to be of the upper crust. Creepshow doesn't have the nihilistic undertone of Romero's usual work or King's expected psychological torture because it is meant to simply be a fun experience.If you're a horror buff, you know Romero has long credited the classic EC horror comics of the 50s (e.g. Tales From the Crypt) as his inspiration. This is basically the whole point of the film; to feel like a comic book brought to life. Hence, things are bound to be marvelously over-the-top in some regards. One of the best things about this film, to me its strongest aspect in general, is its visual style. It angles many shots as if they were cut outs from a comic, there is some awesome usage of hand drawn animation (I LOVE the opening credit scene) and there is some BAD-ASS use of extreme lighting shifts. To put this in perspective, one second the room is darkly lit but not out of the ordinary per say. Next thing you know the room and all its objects are bathed in a blood-like red, making the photography so well done in this picture.Another aspect you have to embrace in order to fully appreciate the film is its tone.

When they get there they find no gold but as Smith explores he meets Pocahontas, the local chief's daughter. Before they met she had had a dream that she believes means her life will take an unexpected path; Smith is certainly unexpected. The two of them immediately become close but after a brief clash both the Indians and the settlers are preparing for war! If bloody conflict is to be avoided Smith and Pocahontas will have to show their respective people that they don't need to be enemies.As one would expect from Disney the animation looks really good; I particularly likes the prelude to the possible battle towards the end. There are also plenty of songs; they aren't bad but I couldn't help feeling that they held up the action a little too much at times. As well as the human characters who provide the drama there are also three animals who provide the comedy relief; these are a raccoon and a hummingbird that are friends of Pocahontas and a dog that belongs to Ratcliffe&#x85; I initially feared that these creatures would be irritating but actually they were pretty funny and I suspect they will be firm favourites with younger viewers. The story is hardly complex but one can't really expect it to be in a story aimed at children; given that I was surprised when one character was killed; it was necessary for the story though and there was no blood shown so it is unlikely to disturb even the most timid of children. The voice actors did fine jobs; giving the characters proper voices rather than annoying cartoony ones. The story does deviate significantly from the story of the real Pocahontas but that doesn't stop it being a fun film with some action, a decent number of laughs and several songs.
