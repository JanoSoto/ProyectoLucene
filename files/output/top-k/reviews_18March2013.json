This film has a lot of things I like to see Comedy, smart characters, unpredictable things happening, and a great story. I'll get to these aspects of it later though.The story is about some kids who love to hang out, and do many activities, but playing baseball together is their favorite thing to do. They eventually run out of baseballs to use when playing outside once, until one of the kids, played by Tom Guiry, borrows his dad's autographed ball (Babe Ruth signed it) and he ends up hitting it over his neighbor's fence, where they think a huge beast lives, but turns out that it's a dog with quite an appetite. So the kids need to find a way to get the ball back before the dad notices it's gone.What I love most about this film is how unpredictable it is. For example, when the kids are trying to get the ball back, they use a catapult. They try to fling the ball back, and the clip suddenly slows down. I thought the ball wouldn't get over the fence and would be just short. I was wrong. The dog actually jumps really high in the air, and he looks like he swallowed the ball. That was very unexpected and hilarious. I like to see things like that. There's also this one part where one of the kids is able to jump over the fence and get the ball, outrun the dog, and jump over. You think he outsmarted the dog, right? Wrong. The dog then jumps over the fence and starts chasing him. How one can predict this, I have no idea.The energy in this movie is outstanding. Not just from the good acting by the kids, but from the comedy as well. There's this scene when one of the kids pretends to drown so he can make out with the very attractive lifeguard. I knew that was going to happen, but I still laughed hard at it because the energy and timing of that joke.I'll knock the film slightly for two things, and one is that there isn't a lot to the story. Basically, the first half of it is just the kids playing baseball and hanging out, and the second half is them trying to get the ball back. That's all there is to it, but for what we got, I still enjoy it, and this is more of a nitpick. My second problem is that if the kids didn't have enough money to buy baseballs, where did they get all that equipment, like the vacuum or catapult, from? I do see that part of it is child made, like one of them seeing through a box of Wheaties, but it's still impressive technology, and I have no idea where they got it from.For what we got, I really enjoyed The Sandlot, and I am really glad I saw it. I consider it one of my favorite comedies now, and that is quite an accomplishment, since I can be quite picky with films like that. I'd say to go see it, but since it got a sequel, and I guess a third one, I'd assume you already did see it.

Comedy This Is Spinal Tap,and also being mesmerise by his elegant adaptation of Stephen King's short story The Body with Stand By Me,I have oddly found myself intensionally staying away from seeing his Comedy Adventure Fantasy film The Princess Bride for a number of years,due to having seen a clip of the movie years ago on TV,that didn't connect with me at all.Checking four days ago to see what was coming out at my local cinema this week,I was shocked to discover that they were holding a one-off screening to celebrate the 25th anniversary of The Princess Bride.Shortly after reading about the screening,I began to get a sudden feeling that something about this film might be pretty special,which led to me running down to the cinema,to pre-book a ticket so that I could at last pay my long,overdue visit to what sounded to be a very special princess.The plotPaying a visit to his ill grandson,the grandfather is sad to discover that his ill in bed grandson is not resting,but instead playing Video Games.Grabbing his grandson's attention for one moment as he enters the bedroom,the grandfather decides to make the most of his opportunity by turning off the TV,and taking a book off the bedroom shelf called The Princess Bride that he used to have read to him when he was his grandson's age.Hearing objections from his grandson,the grandfather tells him to give the novel a chance,as he begins to read The Princess Bride to him.The Princess BrideSpending all of her life on a farm,Buttercup enjoys passing the time by riding the horses that she owns,and also lightly teasing a farm boy called Westley,who replies to Buttercup's teasing with a smile and the words As you wish.Warming to Westley, thanks to him always taking her teasing with good grace,Buttercup begins to feel that Westley's words of As you wish,actually mean I love you,which leads to Buttercup and Westley finally opening up,and falling in love with each other.With neither of them having enough money to afford a wedding,Westley makes the painful decision to leave Buttercup temporally behind,and go to work on a ship,so that he can gather enough money which will allow him and Buttercup to have the marriage of their dreams.Promising that he will return to his beloved soon,Westley's promise soon becomes a fading memory,when Buttercup receives news that Westly's ship has been attacked,and that there are no sign of any survivors.5 years laterGathering the pilgrims of Florin,Prince Humperdinck announces that on the upcoming 500th anniversary of the city's creation,he has decided to mark the day by choosing a pilgrim who he can get married toButtercup.Despite Humperdinck's happiness over the choice of his future wife,Buttercup finds the memories of her first love Westley to have a strong grip on her,which leads to Buttercup feeling completely empty over her future marriage.Riding around the woodland area of Florin,Buttercup is stopped in her tracks by three men called Vizzini,Fezzik and Inigo Montoya,who quickly grab,and kidnap Buttercup.Dragging the still-alive Buttercup's body up the Cliffs of Insanity,due to them wanting to start a war between Florin and a near by city,by placing Buttercup's dead body in the other city.The kidnappers suddenly see a strange image which leaves them completely in shock,due to the image being of a masked wearing man climbing the Cliffs of Insanity and quickly catching up to them,with the strange man looking as if he is willing to do everything possible to get Buttercup out of the kidnappers hands and off the Cliffs of Insanity.View on the filmAdapting from his own 1974 novel,William Goldman's amazingly lean screenplay allows the grandfather and grandson (played by a very good Peter Falk and Ben Savage) to interrupt the unfolding Princess Bride story taking place,which allows for any moments when the film could possibly fall into the clichés of the Fantasy genre,to instead be paunched by Goldman's subtle comedic hand,which led to everyone in the cinema awing and laughing none stop for this brilliant movie.Bending the worn out and tied roads that have been taken with a damsel in distress Fairy tale,Goldman superbly shows the enthralling missions that the characters face with a perfect seriousness that makes sure the viewer laughs with the characters,and not at them.Along with the Fantasy parts to the tale,Goldman also jam-packs the movie with sharp,hilarious Comedy that offers something for all ages.This is thanks to the Comedy going from delightfully silly slap-stick (which wine is poisoned?) and perfectly delivered one-liner's , (Hello,my name is Inigo Montoya.You killed my father.Prepare to die!.) to even some surprisingly satirical moments (the late Peter Cook playing The Impressive Clergyman,and the great line I've hired you to start a war,It's a prestigious line of work,with a long and glorious tradition!.)Revealing an epic eye for scope that he had never shown before,with the Ireland and England locations being shown at their full beauty,co- producer\/director Rob Reiner strikes the perfect balance of allowing the locations to create an enchanting,unforgettable atmosphere,whilst also keeping the movie from flying away by placing all of the characters feet firmly on the ground,which allows for the hilarious Comedy moments to hit their target every time.Brilliantly complementing the astonishing locations,Reiner never allows any of the characters to fade into the corner of the screen,but to instead shine the movie on each of the characters,which helps to make each of the characters feel that they are at the very centre of this truly magical tale.

Benjamin's so civilized and awkward while Mrs. Robinson is so assured and aggressive. Their scenes wouldn't be half so effective had a Redford or some other good-looking guy been cast. Hoffman's just perfect, both physically and attitudinally with his low-key confusion. Too bad, the movie comes apart once Benjamin starts chasing Elaine. It's not funny anymore, nor does his sudden drive make a lot of sense. Shrewdly, there're the sounds of Simon and Garfunkel to take up the slack. A lot of kids thought the ending was a happy one back then. But take a look at how the eloping pair stare vacantly ahead in the final shots. It's like they're suddenly wondering what they've gotten themselves into and what do they do now. There's not even a sign in those vacant stares of the bonding to bridge into the future. No, it's an ambiguous final note despite the triumphal defiance of tradition.All in all, the movie is still worth seeing, mainly for its two wryly comedic and outstanding performances.

Gordon Green expresses his love for Michael Cimino's debut feature; I'm obsessed with this actor (Bill Mckinney) from THUNDERBOLT AND LIGHTFOOT, he has an amazing role where he picks up Jeff Bridges and Clint Eastwood and he's got the raccoons in the car and the bunnies in the trunk. Have you seen that, Jamie? That movie maybe is the best movie ever made. After finally watching the film, plenty of years after hearing that commentary actually, I'm kind of surprised that Tarantino hasn't publicly expressed some love for it &#x96; maybe he has but at least I haven't heard any. Anyway, he must love it. THUNDERBOLT AND LIGHTFOOT is a sort-of mix of many elements &#x96; it's a road movie that becomes a heist one, and that's always a buddy film, all with some folk music. Seeing Clint Eastwood and young Jeff Bridges as new buddies in a car, and a folk song as background music, reminded me of the Jamie Foxx\/Christoph Waltz\/Jim Croce's I've Got a Name part of DJANGO UNCHAINED. And yes, this is too a Clint Eastwood picture of the seventies &#x96; one that begins with Eastwood as a preacher actually but that can't pretend it's different for more than 5 minutes, I mean, the runtime marks 6 minutes and preacher Eastwood is already dealing with some tough guy and some bullets! Nevertheless the film does ends being something *different*. Like I said, first we have a road movie with Bridges' character Lightfoot seeking the friendship of Eastwood &#x96; on the road there's some chases, folk music and crazy characters (like the one Gordon Green mentions), but this is just the setting for the real deal the heist picture. If RESERVOIR DOGS is a heist movie without the heist, then this is a heist film with the heist and the preparation of it. Yes, I know that sounds like an average thing but trust me, the preparation of the heist is pretty darn unique &#x96; the whole thing becomes funny in a good way, like a great absurd comedy with, for instance, some of the criminals working as ice-cream vendors and having problems with their child clients! Eastwood's performance isn't his coolest of the period, certainly it can be seen as a minor work made between the DIRTY HARRY movies. Bridges steals the show for sure. I haven't seen a lot of young Bridges but this has to be one of the most distinctive roles from his early days; he's really funny and even dresses himself as a woman &#x96; crazy stuff overall, with a bittersweet conclusion in the vein of other seventies films. *Watched it on 17 March, 2013 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 March 2013","score":"","review":" I first heard about THUNDERBOLT AND LIGHTFOOT thanks to the DVD commentary of UNDERTOW (2004), featuring director David Gordon Green and actor Jamie Bell.

A great mixture of Horror,Comedy,Wonderful direction, excellent soundtrack,great special effects and an unforgettable villain,Shocker is Wes Craven at his best an most underrated.Shocker tells the story of a college football player named Jonathan Parker(Peter Berg)who after a hard day of practice has a nightmare about a serial killer named Horace Pinker(Mitch Pileggi)who kills Jonathan's family and has been murdering families for months. Unfortunately,Jonathan's nightmare comes true. With Jonathan's help,Pinker captured by the police and sent to the electric chair and even though Pinker is electrocuted and dead,Pinker's soul is still loose thanks to black magic and electricity giving Pinker power to posses people's bodies and get revenge on Jonathan. Now Jonathan has to figure out how to stop Horace Pinker and get rid of Pinker once and for all.Wes Craven's Shocker was Craven's attempt to jump start another Horror film series that revolved around the character Horace Pinker that can rival Freddy Kruger and the Nightmare On Elm Street franchise,after Craven wasn't able to make money off the Elm Street films. Although Shocker made a profit at the box office,it wasn't enough to make a sequel or a series. But that doesn't stop Shocker from being the great, wonderful and Underrated Horror film that it is. The first ten minutes of the film set the tone for most of the film,giving us viewers a world where a city is on edge and Horace Pinker is murdering families during the night and the news and media shows us the horrifying images of Pinker's murders. While it is grounded in reality,Shocker also has nightmarish feel to it where the characters are not safe from Pinker's wrath and the way Craven shows violence in this film and his other films is brutal and harsh. What I also love about Shocker is the Comedy that Craven injects in the film especially when Pinker starts to possess people's bodies,because it's so over the top,insane and filled with maniacal energy and you think as a viewer that the film could not anymore crazier or insane. I also like the pot shots that Craven takes at the media and television where Craven makes fun of the media and their constant reporting on Pinker's whereabouts and that they're televisions always on and all over the place. You can say that Craven's exploration of the media was a precursor to his later films like New Nightmare and the Scream films. Horace Pinker is such a great memorable villain and is one of the most entertaining villains in a 1980s Horror film and is a classic invention from Wes Craven because Pinker is a killer who has a sadistic joy in killing people spitting out funny and insane one-liners and showing no remorse or feelings for what he does. Pinker is so over the top and off the wall you never knew what Pinker was going to do next and you can't talk him down. I believe that if Shocker was a box office hit Shocker would have gotten more sequels and Pinker could have been a major Horror icon and while Horace Pinker wouldn't necessarily be as big or huge as the big three 1980s Horror film icons(Freddy,Jason,Michael Myers),I think Horace Pinker would have been known and recognized by Horror fans. The violence and gore in this film is bloody and brutal and fits in with the film's tone,but you can tell the film's violence was cut(the film was originally rated X and had to be submitted 13 times to get an R rating). One of the main criticisms of Shocker is that it's too similar to the first A Nightmare On Elm Street and while they're maybe some similar styles and a few connections(same director,opening credits,dream sequences,main villains)both films are different and should not be compared. The final 15-20 minutes of the film are among the funniest scenes you will see in Horror film and is filled with such wild imagination and creativity. It is an ending that will stay after the film ends and is a classic Wes Craven ending.The acting from the cast is great. Mitch Pileggi is excellent as Horace Pinker,with Pileggi bringing a scary,over the top and funny brilliance to the role. Peter Berg is wonderful as Jonathan,the hero of the film with Berg bringing depth to the performance. Michael Murphy is effective and believable as Cop Donald Parker,Jonathan's Father. Cami Cooper does a good job as Alison,Jonathan's girlfriend and has a good chemistry with Berg. Sam Scarber(Cooper)and Richard Brooks(Rhino)give good performances as well. Also lookout for cameos by Ted Raimi(Packman),John Tesh(TV Newscastor),Heather Langenkamp(Murder Victim),Dr. Timothy Leary(Television Evangelist) and Wes Craven himself(Neighbor).Wes Craven's direction in the film is excellent with Craven using great camera angles,constantly moving the camera and giving the film a good visual style. Great direction,Craven.The score by William Goldstein is effective and creepy and fits with the films tone. Great score. The film also has a great soundtrack with songs by Megadeth(No More Mr Nice Guy),The Dudes Of Wrath (Shocker),Saraya(Timeless Love),Bonfire(Sword&Stone),Dangerous Toys(Demon Bell-The Ballad Of Horace Pinker)Iggy Pop(Love Transfusion)and Dead On(Different Breed). An excellent Hard-Rockin' Heavy Metal soundtrack.The special effects are well-done and work for the film and hold-up well years later.In final word,if you love Horror films or Wes Craven I highly suggest you check Shocker,a great,underrated Horror film that deserves a second chance and is Wes Craven at his best.

The film also has a great soundtrack with songs by Megadeth(No More Mr Nice Guy),The Dudes Of Wrath (Shocker),Saraya(Timeless Love),Bonfire(Sword&Stone),Dangerous Toys(Demon Bell-The Ballad Of Horace Pinker)Iggy Pop(Love Transfusion)and Dead On(Different Breed). An excellent Hard-Rockin' Heavy Metal soundtrack.The special effects are well-done and work for the film and hold-up well years later.In final word,if you love Horror films or Wes Craven I highly suggest you check Shocker,a great,underrated Horror film that deserves a second chance and is Wes Craven at his best. Highly Recommended. 10\/10.

Based on a Fred Gipson's 1956 children book of the same name, Old Yeller is about a man's best friend, a dog who was ready to do anything to protect his human family.The movie is somewhat an icon, it has found its way into the homes of many, even those who haven't seen the movie have heard about it, thanks to references in the ever popular F.R.I.E.N.D.S TV series, where Phoebe didn't know that Yeller died in the end (Sorry, Spoiler for all of you who haven't seen the movie yet) or it's reference in Justice League as Green Lantern\/John Stewart's favorite movie.The movie features a good cast from the kids to the grown-ups everyone was just perfect; then I have to give Disney a good pat on the back for the dog training. It was just wonderful to see the dog's reactions and his behaviors showed that time went into the training of the dog.Even the child actor who played Arliss was good, he was impressive in his portrayal and I ended up loving him as his pocket never seemed to lack anything but fun.Yeller was a stray dog that happened to come into the life of the Coates family when their father, went out to search for work.His coming was welcomed by the youngest of the Coates, Arliss who always wanted a dog, but the eldest Travis was not so happy to have this new inclusion into the family and was ready to do anything to get Yeller out of the house. Travis changed his mind when one day he was in trouble and there was nobody around but Old Yeller to jump in and save him. (I'm purposely leaving out enough details so that you can enjoy the movie if you have not seen it yet)Walt Disney himself was the producer of this family hit, and it was well received by all who has seen it, the movie can be said to stand as one of the best films about a boy and his dog, although Walt Disney (the company) has tried many other dog and boy movies like Homeward Bound or Savage Sam, but none comes close to the kind of dramatic, adventure fun that Old Yeller delivers.The movie was well received as said and it brought in cash for Disney, so much so that the movie has been re-released, you will always find the DVD of Old Yeller available anywhere, so if like me you waited this long to see it, then maybe you should not wait any longer.

I guess I'd have to be there, to see it with my own eyes. William Friedkin's movies are just ones I love so much (I still have to see his latest, Killer Joe) and here's just another prime example of top floor movie making. Part of an arm surfaces on the New York river, that of a gay man. Another gruesome killing of a helpless gay, who thought he was going home with Mr Right, is what impels the story into action, where cop, Pacino, accepts a job to go undercover and snare this maniac who just before killing his victims, utters remorselessly, You made me do that. We even have some gay hating cops, played by a younger recognizable duo of actors, who arrest a cross dressed gay (Gene Davis) and pull an intimidating stunt on him in the cop car. Of course when he reports it, the detective in charge, (Paul Sorvino) doesn't believe him. Some parts of Cruising are repulsively sick, as we go deep down into the dark side of the homosexual world, which at times is unnerving. Pacino too, makes friends with a gay neighbor\/budding play writer, penning what he hopes will be his next selling piece. Playing the undercover part, he soon finds this very uncomfortable scene, where later on in the movie, this assignment really takers it toll, with Pacino, wanting to call it quits.

After our killer is captured, another victim surfaces, another horrific crime scene, a forewarning another sickie is out there. At this scene, when a cop addresses himself and his partner to Sorvino, these cop's names ring bells, when earlier spouted by Davis (another asset to the film) who was harassed.

Cross gender ? The Brits have been doing that for a 100 yrs. The rest of the movie, while well crafted and acted, is pretty predictable in it's construct.Now here is where AFI is chickenshit . Life Of Brian is not eligible , because it's not American, yet one of their 'top 5' , Dr. Strangelove is, WHY ??? Both were produced in the UK. Kicker is, as I understand it, is that 'Brian' had no US distributor therefore made it ineligible for for 'AFI' consideration. ( Please correct if wrong ).Now, I'm gonna catch hell for this, but Monty's big cash cow 'Holy Grail', does nothing for me. OK, maybe the stage thing works ( I have not seen it ), but the movie didn't, not by a long shot. Pointless, Jerry Lewis spasmodic slapstick.I call your attention to the first 'Pink Panther' movie. While Sellers was not meant to be the focus of the movie ( there were many stars in it ) his bumbling inspector became a franchise. & in each following movie it became worser ( forget spellcheck, I know I'm leaving good grammar...as if I ever had ever had any..) It was in the first 'Panther ' , that the great Mr. Sellers, did his finest work of the series. Understood , he was doing slapstick, BUT, not over the top; Jerry Lewis, 3 Stooges , in your face stupid buffoonery, it was always in denial, & that's what made it great.

Sure, one should be able to judge a film on its own merits, but I feel like it would be more fair to put this one in context of his overall career, seeing as this was 55 years ago...Bosley Crowther gave the film a mixed review, saying this one is aimed more surely toward the development of a theme than a plot. Its interest is not so much the conflicts that occur in the life of the heroine as the deep, underlying implications of human pathos that the pattern of her life shows... But there are two weaknesses in Cabiria. It has a sordid atmosphere and there is something elusive and insufficient about the character of the heroine. Her get-up is weird and illogical for the milieu in which she lives and her farcical mannerisms clash with the ugly realism of the theme. I include this here merely to show how time has aged this film well -- no critic today would come down so harsh on Fellini.What I actually found most interesting was the producer being Dino De Laurentiis.

I appreciate the stylization and simplicity of the set. Since this was originally released in 3D, that explains why the less is more approach works. The plot is plausible. Grace's wardrobe is simple yet lovely, and Grace herself is as beautiful as always. My issues were and still are with the casting and the acting...two pretty big issues. I don't believe for one minute that Grace Kelly's character would love, much less marry Ray Milland's. I also don't believe that she would become romantically involved with Robert Cummings. Fine actors on their own, they are not credible to me as love interests for such a young beauty. That element weakens the whole plot.The acting leans toward the over-the-top melodrama of the Golden Age. This is quite unusual and unnecessary in a Hitchcock film. Grace is guilty of it herself. Her accent bothered me originally. She sounds a little British and a little bit of Hollywood vocal polish. Milland, who can be very charming, is almost too bland and his clipped speech drains away his emotion to such a point that it is hard to connect with his character at all and to see how Grace ever could have fallen in love with him. Robert Cummings is pure American Pie, which he really is, but he doesn't seem like someone who would attract Grace Kelly away from her debonair yet older husband. None of the characters seem full of enough emotion to be caught up in a love triangle much less a murder plot. I am plenty capable of suspending belief, but if this movie is going to be so highly ranked in the IMDb 250 out of all the movies in the world, then I find it quite surprising and tend to wonder if guys are so stuck on Grace (in clothes or even in a nightgown) or loyal to Hitchcock that the implausibility of the plot with all of its flaws with the main characters is accepted without question.I have loved both of these main male stars as well as Kelly in other films. Sometimes I'll watch a film just to get to see these actors act. This one, even after repeated viewings, still bugs me, but I still find myself drawn to it regardless. I've finally realized that it plays like a play. it is simple and the supporting cast and mystery really drive the plot. That is a testament to Hitchcock's ability to pull together a film that doesn't compare in dramatic content to most of his other films, yet it still envelops and endures almost 60 ears later.

And the merging of these talents was well done by Steven Soderbergh, who was the director and cinematographer of the movie.Daniel Ocean and his crew made robbing a casino look easy, since all you need is some background cash and a crew of different people with unique skills. If you have these people in your back pocket then you, the robber are game enough to take down anybody.Steven Soderbergh and Clooney came together with the aim of putting this film together and after the wonderful display of acting from all the cast, let's not forget Julia Robert and Andy Garcia were also in this movie, the movie was well received and led to a trilogy.The movie is about Danny Ocean (George Clooney), who just got out of jail and the first thing on his mind is to perform the perfect steal. After Danny got out he started to recruit the team members for his heist, they wereIn order of recruitment 1. George Clooney as Danny Ocean 2. Bernie Mac as Frank Catton 3. Brad Pitt as Rusty Ryan 4. lliott Gould as Reuben Tishkoff 5. Casey Affleck as Virgil Malloy 6. Scott Caan as Turk Malloy 7. Eddie Jemison as Livingston Dell 8. Don Cheadle as Basher Tarr 9. Shaobo Qin as The Amazing Yen 10. Carl Reiner as Saul Bloom 11. Matt Damon as Linus CaldwellThe job looked impossible but Danny believed they could do it, so together they formed the master plan to take on the Bellagio, The Mirage, and the MGM Grand casinos, these casinos were owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia).There is also a catch to this heist; Danny's Ex-Wife (Julia Roberts) is now going out with Benedict.This movie was extremely popular and the movie grew from just a fun movie to watch, to having a huge fan base that led to the release of two other Ocean crew movies that also had the same cast from here and featured new popular cast. This movie cost nothing less than $85 million to make, due majorly to the cast, but it made its money back and over in the box office and it stands as the best of all the three in the franchise.My favorite take from the movie is that 50% of the time when Brad Pitt is on screen he is eating something.www.lagsreviews.com ","genre":null},{"date":"18 March 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Ocean's Eleven is a remake of a Rat Pack 1960 movie of the same name that starred Frank Sinatra.
