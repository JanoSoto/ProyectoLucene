[{"date":"4 November 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Unlike 84 Charing Cross Road the writing (of letters) is largely incidental, and the real plot is 'will they get it together?' This of course means there is no suspense since in movies of this type the couple always gets it together. And so it is. This is apparently a remake of some earlier Hollywood hit and follows the romantic comedy formula perfectly, even down to the protagonists' compulsory best friends.The script is by Norah Ephron, and she does raise a laugh on occasion. When Tom Hanks introduces the children he is with to Meg Ryan, it turns out the 7 year old girl is his aunt and the 9 year old is his brother, the products of late second marriages by his father and grandfather (both still alive). A typical American family says Tom. I hope not - Dad and Grandad are pretty ruthless people. Recommended? Well, saw this one as an in-flight movie, so it was free. It could have been worse.
