A good orchestra playing in the background adds so much tension to a film and the stark black and white set was just perfect for it. Add a crisp and racy script, my favourite actor Marlon Brando at the height of his powers in my favourite type of film ( a mob-drama ) and you get a classic which has made all films after it look tame. It's pace is cracking; the blend of drama, suspense and the little romance super and the individual performances terrific. What really stand out are the performances of Lee J Cobb and Rod Steiger. Not even slightly overdone, just perfect. Brando's performance is the best yet seen on screen ; will probably remain so for another fifty years. At the end there is redemption of a kind which brings the entire movie together. And it's a lamentable fact that this film is languishing at no 103 on this list below crap like The Matrix, Braveheart , Goodfellas, Memento , Se7en, The Dark Knight .. the list goes on.

A space vampire?? Whoever ever think about this kind of movie?? Based on the novel space vampire,Lifeforce made out as a success movie in the 80's. I was tend to watch this movie when i found out at the IMDb which was given an average rating of 5.8. This is actually an unknown movie for there are only about 5000 people who votes on Lifeforce, so, i'm giving it a chance. The main reason i watched this movie is likely because my friend want to watch a sci-fi movie. Then i search all around in IMDb and found this one. Tobe Hooper have created good movies recently especially Texas chainsaw massacre, funhouse and some others..so i think i should try out Lifeforce.At first, the movie is full of suspense, not because of its special effect (which i think quiet cool for the 80's), but the acting, the music and how the story lines goes. Actually, it makes feel very confusing.. but i kept on watching till i found out what the hell is it all about. At the end, i still not fully understand the whole matter of Lifeforce, but it is already enough for me and my friend to conclude that this is a good movie. The only thing that i hate about this movie is the sex scene,huhu...overall, the plot line is interesting, the acting is not incredibly brilliant, but still there are good performances from the actors, surely not an Oscar material, but still a good one.I think that this movie deserves a second chance, find it and watch it.

It's a stylish and very well done movie that from a cinematic point of view is a superb one, even when its moments and emotions are obviously exaggerated for its cinematic reasons. It doesn't matter since All About Eve is a real movie movie, made for the big screen and written for the actors to shine in it.Bette Davis is truly fantastic in some of the movie its moments but still I feel that Anne Baxter and George Sanders perhaps deserve even more credit for their roles. It after all is also Anne Baxter who plays the true main character of the movie, at least in the second halve. Because of this both Davis and Baxter also got nominated in the same category for best actress in a leading role. Of course not something that is very usual. Both lost out however to Judy Holliday for her role in Born Yesterday.It's story progresses nicely throughout its 138 minutes of running time. It perhaps gets a bit predictable after a while, especially for todays audience but the class and style this movie got made with keeps you watching- and interested throughout its entire running time. The script provides the movie with a couple of great dialogs, which in return brings out the best of some the actors. It's a real story that got character driven and could had basically been about anything and still would had made a great movie. One fine multiple Oscar winning production from Darryl F.

It's a stylish and very well done movie that from a cinematic point of view is a superb one, even when its moments and emotions are obviously exaggerated for its cinematic reasons.

It after all is also Anne Baxter who plays the true main character of the movie, at least in the second halve. Because of this both Davis and Baxter also got nominated in the same category for best actress in a leading role. Of course not something that is very usual. Both lost out however to Judy Holliday for her role in Born Yesterday.It's story progresses nicely throughout its 138 minutes of running time. It perhaps gets a bit predictable after a while, especially for todays audience but the class and style this movie got made with keeps you watching- and interested throughout its entire running time. The script provides the movie with a couple of great dialogs, which in return brings out the best of some the actors. It's a real story that got character driven and could had basically been about anything and still would had made a great movie. One fine multiple Oscar winning production from Darryl F.

She gave me The Hobbit, which is about Bilbo Baggins and his wizard friend Gandalf the Grey. Before reading this book I had never heard of J.R.R Tolkien so I wasn't sure what to expect, sufficed to say I thought the book was really good, quite a bit on the detailed side in terms of characters and the environment, which made for me the book waffling on a bit, but still really enjoyable nonetheless. Then my sister introduced me to Lord of the Rings and I read the first one before the film came out. I didn't like it. For me like The Hobbit it was just too detailed and kept trailing of the main plot of the story and eventually I put it down. But I felt guilty I was wanted to get into it so I decided to go back to it but instead like the first time reading it all through at once, which I do with books. I read it in shorter instalments to stop myself getting bored quickly and managed to finish it and sufficed to say I enjoyed it.With Tolkien for me once I read it I viewed his notion to express the deep detail of Middle Earth geographically and all the characters, there experiences and habits differently I realised this book was rich in detail, intellect and character development and without this extra part the book wouldn't have been half as enjoyable like when Gandalf falls across the bridge of Khazadum in Moria. I felt sad because in the book his character has been built up as person who cares about others and is gentle in nature but fiercely protects those he loves like Frodo. When the film came out I had never heard of Peter Jackson as director and went to the screening of Lord of the Rings quite apprehensive that Jackson couldn't pull it off. I sat down and from the beginning I was absolutely enraptured and two hours and forty five minutes the length of this film flew by. To say this is an incredible accomplishment is a lie. The Fellowship of the Ring rightly scooped four Oscars though it should have received more. What makes this book to film adaption so successful is Jackson's love for being a fan of the books. He truly keeps faithful to Tolkien's book and though there are chunks missing. The themes of friendship, loyalty, courage and cultural diversity are all here and are all cleverly linked together and flow naturally throughout the film.Jackson also got the attention to detail of the environment perfectly. Filming this in New Zeeland with it's glorious landscape, mountains and forests made me fall in love with the country. Jackson sweeps the camera across a wide arc when the characters are travelling but he never pans the camera too fast so the audience gets the whole visual spectacle and it is simply a breathtaking experience and worth the price of admission in itself.Other environments like The Shire, Rivendale and Moria all add texture to the rich detail of the film and are perfectly symmetrical to the characters emotions in the scene.The acting is also amazing. The bonds of friendship felt between the fellowship are easily apparent in particular between Frodo played superbly by Elijah Wood and Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen) is real and deeply felt. All the others actors and actresses are terrific including Sean Asrin as Samwise Gamgee, Merry Brandybuck (Dominic Monaghan) and Perrigrin Tock (Billy Boyd) elf witch Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) Gimli the Drawf played by John-Rhys-Davis who provides comic relief, Legalos the Elf (Orlando Bloom) Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) Boromir (Sean Bean) Lord Elrond (Hugo Weaving) Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) the elf Arwen (Liv Tyler) and Sauraman (Christopher Lee) play all there characters with real understanding and depth and perfectly represent the essence and tone of the characters in the book.The special effects like digitally enhanced and CGI are equally stunning like the fire demon in Moria and the trolls making them seem real. Sufficed to say Jackson set himself a enormous task and has achieved it. There were no criticisms I could find for this film and everyone who took part no matter how small a contribution have to be commended.The action sequences are choreographed to perfection and the music is gorgeous to listen to which add the extra spark to the movie. This is grandeur on a massive scale and is terrifically entertaining. I implore you to see this. You will regret it if you don't. This is film in the making and Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring has for me surly become one of the best films of all time. But there are still parts two and three which I obsessively look forward to with manic glee.

","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"},{"date":"23 October 2009","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" After the pointless mess that was Halloween H20, I was obviously not all that excited to witness the Resurrection. However, once I've invested my time in 7 films in a franchise, it's pretty much a given that I'm going to see the 8th, if only to hold on to the vain hope that maybe someday I will get a Halloween sequel that comes anywhere close to matching the original.Resurrection isn't necessarily a good movie, but by utilizing a fresh concept and doing some interesting things with it, the film at least manages to be entertaining. At this point in the franchise, offering a Michael Myers tale that doesn't make you want to turn off the movie midway through is a genuine accomplishment.Perhaps the most rewarding thing about this 8th Halloween installment is how much it catches the viewer off guard. After all, with both Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks in the cast, we're almost assured that this will be the penultimate awful Halloween sequel. But, when the end result is a modestly entertaining 90 minutes, we have to concede that Resurrection manages something that some of the other entries in the franchise haven't done.Don't get me wrong; there's still stupidity galore here.The opening scene with the return of Laurie Strode has nothing to do with the film that follows, and we get the sense that Jamie Lee Curtis only agreed to appear in Resurrection so that she could be killed off, thus sparing herself the indignity of ever having to appear in a Halloween movie again. While we should probably feel some sort of dramatic impact after seeing her finally fall prey to the bogeyman who has pursued her through three films before this one, the entire sequence is so devoid of suspense or purpose that any sense of climax is negated, and it's hard to feel much sympathy for our former protagonist when she essentially walks into the knife herself.Busta Rhymes is one of the main characters here, which is asinine enough in itself, but this idiocy is compounded by the series of lame one-liners he has throughout the film. In a franchise that has set new standards of dumb, there's no debating that the single worst line to ever grace a Halloween film is delivered from Busta's lips here trick or treat, motherf****r. Did I mention he also does karate in this movie? Unfortunately, I'm totally serious.Battlestar Galactica fans may be excited at the prospect of an early appearance by Katee Sackhoff. But don't be; she's the single most irritating and unlikable character in a cast full of them, and the dialogue our beloved Starbuck is forced to deliver is a frakking embarrassment.Then there's the slight problem of Michael Myers being decapitated at the conclusion of Halloween H2O, which could be viewed as a considerable hindrance to his being able to slash his way through his roster of victims here. Though the explanation used to solve this problem is iffy at best, it's worth noting that if you watch the finale of H2O, there isn't a single element that betrays the unlikely scenario described here. At least they thought it through a bit, we have to give them that.Elsewhere in the film, there is other evidence of a brain being involved somewhere in the creative process. The concept itself is strong and timely, and the execution is well realized. The alternation between different cameras to give us first-person views from our doomed characters that augment the standard film format sets up some nice images, particularly since we're dealing with dark and grainy video that heightens the tension on its own. Michael Myers hasn't looked scarier in years than he does lurking in the shadows of his dilapidated house, as seen through the POV cameras of his future victims.We alternate between the happenings inside the house and the view of the voyeuristic internet users watching the events from the safety of the outside world, and the reactions of the viewers are particularly smart. As Michael slices his way though the cast, the online audience is engrossed in the story, but unwilling to believe that what they are seeing is real. This is a fine commentary on how our media culture has learned to distrust how genuine the elements of reality TV are, and how we've adapted to accepting the most loathsome activities of the stars of these shows as part of the entertainment.

However, once I've invested my time in 7 films in a franchise, it's pretty much a given that I'm going to see the 8th, if only to hold on to the vain hope that maybe someday I will get a Halloween sequel that comes anywhere close to matching the original.Resurrection isn't necessarily a good movie, but by utilizing a fresh concept and doing some interesting things with it, the film at least manages to be entertaining. At this point in the franchise, offering a Michael Myers tale that doesn't make you want to turn off the movie midway through is a genuine accomplishment.Perhaps the most rewarding thing about this 8th Halloween installment is how much it catches the viewer off guard. After all, with both Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks in the cast, we're almost assured that this will be the penultimate awful Halloween sequel. But, when the end result is a modestly entertaining 90 minutes, we have to concede that Resurrection manages something that some of the other entries in the franchise haven't done.Don't get me wrong; there's still stupidity galore here.The opening scene with the return of Laurie Strode has nothing to do with the film that follows, and we get the sense that Jamie Lee Curtis only agreed to appear in Resurrection so that she could be killed off, thus sparing herself the indignity of ever having to appear in a Halloween movie again. While we should probably feel some sort of dramatic impact after seeing her finally fall prey to the bogeyman who has pursued her through three films before this one, the entire sequence is so devoid of suspense or purpose that any sense of climax is negated, and it's hard to feel much sympathy for our former protagonist when she essentially walks into the knife herself.Busta Rhymes is one of the main characters here, which is asinine enough in itself, but this idiocy is compounded by the series of lame one-liners he has throughout the film. In a franchise that has set new standards of dumb, there's no debating that the single worst line to ever grace a Halloween film is delivered from Busta's lips here trick or treat, motherf****r. Did I mention he also does karate in this movie? Unfortunately, I'm totally serious.Battlestar Galactica fans may be excited at the prospect of an early appearance by Katee Sackhoff. But don't be; she's the single most irritating and unlikable character in a cast full of them, and the dialogue our beloved Starbuck is forced to deliver is a frakking embarrassment.Then there's the slight problem of Michael Myers being decapitated at the conclusion of Halloween H2O, which could be viewed as a considerable hindrance to his being able to slash his way through his roster of victims here. Though the explanation used to solve this problem is iffy at best, it's worth noting that if you watch the finale of H2O, there isn't a single element that betrays the unlikely scenario described here. At least they thought it through a bit, we have to give them that.Elsewhere in the film, there is other evidence of a brain being involved somewhere in the creative process. The concept itself is strong and timely, and the execution is well realized. The alternation between different cameras to give us first-person views from our doomed characters that augment the standard film format sets up some nice images, particularly since we're dealing with dark and grainy video that heightens the tension on its own. Michael Myers hasn't looked scarier in years than he does lurking in the shadows of his dilapidated house, as seen through the POV cameras of his future victims.We alternate between the happenings inside the house and the view of the voyeuristic internet users watching the events from the safety of the outside world, and the reactions of the viewers are particularly smart. As Michael slices his way though the cast, the online audience is engrossed in the story, but unwilling to believe that what they are seeing is real. This is a fine commentary on how our media culture has learned to distrust how genuine the elements of reality TV are, and how we've adapted to accepting the most loathsome activities of the stars of these shows as part of the entertainment.

Got that? Okay, the turtles are all named after famous Renaissance painters (Donatello, Michaelangelo, Leonardo and Raphael) and they end up getting involved with a news reporter named April O'Neil (played rather blandly by Judith Hoag). There's also a pleasant vigilante who ends up lending a helping hand and his name is Casey Jones (played with exuberance by the great Elias Koteas). Still with me? There's an evil big baddie named Shredder, who has his army of teenaged martial artists (called, rather unscarily, The Foot Clan) and who wants the turtles out of the picture.I think that covers all of the details, however ridiculous they seem. Basically, this movie takes a very popular franchise of the time (originally in graphic novel form and then made into a hugely popular children's cartoon) and packages it into an enjoyable movie for the masses. It's about men in rubber turtle suits pulling off some impressive fight moves while talking like surfer dudes and that's really all there is to it. You may hate it but it's hard to totally loathe and I was surprised by how much affection I found I had for this little movie.For those who weren't there at the time there are still plenty of little things to enjoy, from the dated lingo to a small appearance from a pre-big time Sam Rockwell. For those who were there then it's a mixture of fun, nostalgia and simple pleasures. Okay, this is yet another movie that will win no awards but it's very much of it's time and actually does rather well at giving the shelled heroes enough to do in the action department while not scaring off the kiddies. There is nothing really too praiseworthy in the technical side of things (the script never really rises above cowabunga while none of the shots stand out as classics in the field of action cinema) but it does enough to get by.See this if you like Double Dragon, Super Mario Bros, Tank Girl.

He succeeds in meeting the standards of the first film by Ridley Scott and possible even goes as far as exceeding them. The basic premise is the same; a tense thriller set in space where a group of humans, in this case marines, fight to survive against a formidable foe, the Alien. The major difference between this film and its predecessor is that instead of one just Alien there are a lot more! Credit to James Cameron as with worries from the studio about the cost of producing so many Aliens he had to achieve the effect multiple creatures using only 6 Alien suits! An effect he succeeds in doing extremely well. Special mention should also go to to the set designers and lighting on this film who successfully transported me on board the ships and alien planets through fantastically intricate, expertly lit sets. The attention to detail is amazing (see if you can read the profiles of the previous crew members behind Ridley in the beginning of the film) and really adds to the credibility of the film. A real negative point of the film which I feel needs mention is the acting of the awfully stereotypical marine soldiers. With predictable dialogue and over the top Neanderthal caricatures they manage to make the film in parts unintentionally comical! An exceptionally cringy performance from Bill Paxton (usually a reliable actor) ranges from being a cocky arrogant hardman to dribbling scared mess seeming to contradict his own character with every scene. This often takes away from the credibility and suspense of the film. Having said that, the acting is not without star turns the drill Sergeant figure is witty (if still a little stereotypical) but special mention should go to the little girl, Carrie Henn, and of course Sigourney Weaver, who's brilliant heroine character is given more depth in this film which she pulls off with a plom. As a whole, the film manages to sustain suspense throughout through excellent use of fast cuts and POV camera shots, only easing the tension occasionally, allowing the audience to breath, before throwing them head first back into the action. James Cameron set out to make a 'fun, stand alone film that had resonance of the first alien feature'. Well Mr Cameron I say Job well done!

The attention to detail is amazing (see if you can read the profiles of the previous crew members behind Ridley in the beginning of the film) and really adds to the credibility of the film. A real negative point of the film which I feel needs mention is the acting of the awfully stereotypical marine soldiers. With predictable dialogue and over the top Neanderthal caricatures they manage to make the film in parts unintentionally comical! An exceptionally cringy performance from Bill Paxton (usually a reliable actor) ranges from being a cocky arrogant hardman to dribbling scared mess seeming to contradict his own character with every scene. This often takes away from the credibility and suspense of the film. Having said that, the acting is not without star turns the drill Sergeant figure is witty (if still a little stereotypical) but special mention should go to the little girl, Carrie Henn, and of course Sigourney Weaver, who's brilliant heroine character is given more depth in this film which she pulls off with a plom. As a whole, the film manages to sustain suspense throughout through excellent use of fast cuts and POV camera shots, only easing the tension occasionally, allowing the audience to breath, before throwing them head first back into the action. James Cameron set out to make a 'fun, stand alone film that had resonance of the first alien feature'. Well Mr Cameron I say Job well done!
