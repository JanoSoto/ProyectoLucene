House on Haunted Hill is surprisingly entertaining. It is rather lame though, if you're expecting something scary. Despite the fact that it is blatantly campy, it's a very fun movie. You just can't except much, it being a mainstream horror movie from the 50's. When I saw this movie, I was really into watching Horror. I also wanted to watch something scary, and whenever something wasn't scary enough, I couldn't help but feel disappointed. But in retrospect, it's actually a pretty good movie. I did jump once in the movie, though only because of a disfigured face and a sudden loud noise. I can imagine House on Haunted Hill not being scary even the year it came out. Movies like this are probably what you would want to show your kids if they are interested in horror, and you know it's not time to show them the Night of the Living Dead. It could be used to give them a little taste of the horror genre. It is really good for something like that, or if for some reason you are in the mood for an old campy movie. It should do the trick for that too. Though it does not stand out too much as a great horror film. It has a few scenes that really scream 1959, when it was made. I wouldn't recommend it as a scary movie, but if you just want to have a good time watching an old movie, then this might be for you.

This sequel 'The Beginning' is a prequel to the original and from the trivia on this site it explains that it was actually made before Joseph Zito's film which was shot back to back with number two. I guessed they liked Zito's effort more, and you can see why.This very low-cost, raw looking sequel (prequel) seems to primarily parading around its many fragmented set-pieces of brutally unpleasant torture and demoralizing spirit-breaking with little in a way of story to back it all up. Due to this it did become a tad dull and numerously repetitive making it feel longer than it is, but few and far between are some effective moments like a rat in a bag sequence. After a slowly lean get-up amongst the stinking hot jungle setting and POW camp (which for most part is completely dreary), it finally breaks the shackles in the last half-hour or so with blistering action (even some of it is poorly conceived) complete with explosions and Norris suitably paying back some of his own medicine in what is a fittingly tough and cheering confrontation (due to what has gone before it) with the sadistically malevolent Colonel Yin performed with smarting glee by Soon Tek-oh. Norris looking quite weathered and bruised goes about things in a steely and scrappy manner until the rage he kept inside finally breaks out after the constant torment to get him to confess to the unheralded crimes. The acting is inconsistent, but the cast features the likes of Steven Williams (probably best known for his part as X in the 'X-Files' series), John Wesley and Professor Toru Tanaka. Lance Hool's direction is fundamentally junky with the score pumping out the cues with a somber touch at times.Although I've seen this feature quite a few times, it's so forgettable that each time I do happen to come across it's like I'm watching it for the first time again.

It's predates Three Kings by thirty years as a yarn about a group of soldiers out to get a whole crap-load of gold bars (sixteen million to be exact), and it gives us a group of characters we can have fun with and, more or less, care about in their quest for the gold. It's also one of those guy movies where there is not much sign of the opposite sex and us dudes get to hang out with Clint, Don Rickles, Telly Savalas, and a very bizarre but perfectly entertaining Donald Sutherland. And if you need to get pumped up for a new war movie coming out (i.e. Inglorious Basterds) it does just the trick.We follow our group of 'heroes' who are able to slip by their superiors to go after gold locked up in enemy territory. If it doesn't have the same satirical impact of Three Kings it at least has an abundance of tough, brawny action scenes and even a fun knock at General Patton with Carrol O'Connor's character. We don't get the deepest insight into Americans or Germans during WW2, but we don't need it really anyway. It sometimes just makes for an intriguing viewing trying to figure out where Sutherland is at he's a dead-on hippie, but without the same subterfuge that one saw in MASH... and yet, arguably perhaps, I was much more responsive to him here than with his fun-but-smug character in Altman's comedy. He keeps saying lines like don't make bad waves! and is only missing tie-dye and a joint to fulfill the package. Without a real good reason perhaps except on a visceral level, I would recommend the film if only to check out Sutherland here.But there's other good things about Kelly's Heroes. Clint is Clint, which makes for some fun exchanges, especially with some of the more testy soldiers in the group or at a moment of a pinch, and Savalas makes some really good ground as one of those hard-but-fair army unit leaders who we can sympathize with when he has his doubts (the most doubtful of all) that the heist can actually work. And Don Rickles shows how he was as much good as an actor, when properly used, as a classic-snarky comedian. Other little treats include seeing Harry Dean Stanton crooning on the harmonica, the climax of the movie turning at a distinct point into a western (and, as an influence mayhap, Tarantinian), and that theme song Burning Bridges being catchy and hard-charging as a driving force for the characters.My only big gripes were the beginning and end scenes, as they dragged and didn't add a whole lot to the story. It's a decent try, at the start, to establish the hectic and frenetic mood of nighttime combat, but it obstructs what's more interesting with Kelly and the drunk German. Also, the ending goes on at least five minutes too long, as we see quick cut-aways of the soldiers' reactions to seeing the gold with images of a liberation celebration in the streets, which would have been sublime, but there's more movie that goes on after this point that doesn't need it. But overall, Kelly's Heroes is a lot of fun, with convincing action and direction and writing.

The homosexual guy trusts him so quickly and tells Karl how he can't do an outing. He and the poooooooooor kiddo get best friends. Problem is, this continues almost two hours. It was like a terrible happy ending all over the movie. Next problem, i didn't wonder about the ending at all, when he kills that bad bad bad boyfriend. In fact i was hoping all movie long that he would do that. So maybe this this whole happy story was about to let us not think, that Karl would murder again. But this attempt completely failed. Well i was once working with retarded children and i loved that job, so i don't think that Billy Bob Thornton's acting was very good. If you want to see a brilliant performance, then watch Rainman with Dustin Hoffman. Also Forrest Gump does so much better regarding acting of the main character.

I found it very interesting that an FBI agent would interview a imprisoned serial killer who is a cannibal, to find out more about another serial killer on the loose. Hannibal is almost presented as the good guy in some scenes. Of course, he cannot be the actual good guy, he sure is in contrast to that creepy Buffalo Bill. Clarice Starling is a unit agent of the law, and Hannibal is a being who defied it, but they are paradoxically, on the same side. This movie didn't disappoint me but was still creepy, but then again it didn't exceed the creepiness I expected. The Silence of the Lambs has very intense scenes mostly involving the autopsy of a filthy cut-up person, a kidnapping, and not to mention Hannibal eating a warden's face. It might be a good idea to watch out for these scenes before watching. I wouldn't really recommend that anybody under 16 watch this. The entire premise for the movie is very disturbing itself, with the movie becoming even more unsettling than the general plot. The Silence of the Lambs is still creepy, but I really felt like I was watching a movie made in the 90's. It really shows its age.

Hannibal is almost presented as the good guy in some scenes. Of course, he cannot be the actual good guy, he sure is in contrast to that creepy Buffalo Bill. Clarice Starling is a unit agent of the law, and Hannibal is a being who defied it, but they are paradoxically, on the same side. This movie didn't disappoint me but was still creepy, but then again it didn't exceed the creepiness I expected. The Silence of the Lambs has very intense scenes mostly involving the autopsy of a filthy cut-up person, a kidnapping, and not to mention Hannibal eating a warden's face. It might be a good idea to watch out for these scenes before watching. I wouldn't really recommend that anybody under 16 watch this. The entire premise for the movie is very disturbing itself, with the movie becoming even more unsettling than the general plot. The Silence of the Lambs is still creepy, but I really felt like I was watching a movie made in the 90's. It really shows its age. It is well made for the most part, but I really think that it's too disturbing to truly be one of the greatest movies movies of all time, as IMDb votes would lead one to believe.

This was a very impressive horror flick. It had everything in it; plenty of horror, gore, darkness and uniqueness. I was wasn't very satisfied at the beginning because it had such a slow start but as the film progressed in to 10 minutes or so it definitely got better and started looping in to the terrifying action. Unlike any other horror films I watched this has got to the most unique. I mean this film had sort of more depth to it than the 2nd movie but I'm not saying its better its just a good start to JEEPERS CREEPERS. And the thing feeding on humans. Very scary. And the scene in the abandoned church where all the dead bodies were was just gruesome. The music...the music! Whenever you here the 60's Jeepers Creepers song, it's coming after you! How scary is that?! Like in the radio it played that song and that monster was right behind them! That was just classic. Very funny yet brutally scary! The ending was surprising also. I was even more surprised to hear the Boogeyman song in the credits. I think the producers should have stuck to the Jeepers Creepers song because come on it's not Boogeyman! Is it? See thats the things, what is that villains name? Because I keep on calling him thing or monster and the credits presume hes called Boogeyman (even though we already have a Boogeyman!) I have no idea... But overall I love this horror flick. Unique like I said and scary and surprising. Looking at some of the comments I don't understand why people hate it. Well for me it was actually very well done!********\/********** (8\/10 stars) ~Kalendra ","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"21 August 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I watched this film 4 hours ago (I know I'm quite late!) and yet still it disturbs me.

None of her other films even come close. This has been my favorite film since I first saw it & I know it always will be. I read the book, and while it was good, I would rather watch this movie. Shane West did an amazing transformation with the character of Landon Carter. I could not see how some people hated this movie. Not only is it an amazing love story, but it shows how one person can truly help change someone for the better. It's just a shame that such a wonderful love story had to end so sadly This is the best story of love, faith & hope out there. I would highly recommend it to anyone. This movie is truly a treasure.
