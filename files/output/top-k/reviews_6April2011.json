By the summer of 2001 it seemed to be the movie everybody loved to hate. Were the criticisms fair? Not if you ask me.2001's Planet of the Apes' biggest downfall, in my opinion, is unfortunately also it's biggest strength. Unlike many remakes which often end up as nothing more than weaker rehashes of their predecessor's this version of 'Apes' dared to be different. The plot has been stripped down to its bare bones and then rebuilt into something completely new. This is refreshing, if you ask me. Especially when rewatching it now, because just a few short years after this film came out we launched into sort of a remake renaissance, where half the tent pole films that come out every year are the same lesser rehashes that I spoke of a second ago. This film does take a moment here and there to wink at the '68 original, but Burton and his merry band of screenwriters has created a world completely original...it could be watched next to any entry of that original series as a wholey different film.This is also the film's biggest flaw though, or at least financially speaking, because the original 'Apes' franchise has a cult following behind it that could almost rival that of Star Wars or Star Trek. The core audience for this film really only wanted to see their favourite story told with modern day effects and makeup. I don't think we needed that, but I'm not sure how many would agree with me.Now, if you want to compare the two films plots and decide which one is stronger that's a whole other debate. But I don't think that's fair, that's why I champion it for taking such a different approach. I don't think this movie should be compared to any other movie and with that mindset a much better appreciation can be found. To put it bluntly, this movie ain't bad...in fact it's actually pretty good.I won't deconstruct the plot for you...if you're interested enough to be reading this you probably at least know the jist of it anyway. But it's a solid and interesting plot that sets up a very fun and entertaining action adventure flick. Visually its in many ways a departure from typical Burton fair but his stamp is definitely evident in its art direction, and the atmosphere he creates in this jungle\/desert\/urban\/high tech universe is really something to behold. The apes are not only impressive in terms of makeup but they are also creatively impressive from the choices of the species to match personalities, the incredible costumes and simply perfect performances by a cast who act through all that latex. And while I'm praising I'll also throw up a shout out for Danny Elfman's great score, which just might be one of his best.The only caveat I'll lay on the movie is that the twist ending, obviously conceived to rival the famous twist of the original, kind of falls flat. BUT...considering how many instalments the original franchise had I have no doubt that the producers had hoped to make a sequel had this film been more financially successful, and had that sequel been made maybe we would've learned the story behind this twist and all would've been forgiven.It's a little too late to say, 'long story short,' but I will anyway. Give this movie a fair shot. It may not be without its flaws but how many movies are? Try not to compare it to the original, just watch it with a bowl of popcorn and have fun.

I define a Hamlet Syndrome work as one that is so important, revolutionary, and\/or complex that it has been endlessly analyzed from multiple perspectives, and therefore impossible to make an original comment upon. In other words, what can I say about this movie that hasn't been said before? For example, I'm sure I'm not the only poster who has seen this movie multiple times in the theater (5 times in my case). Also, many posters must own the VHS or DVD version; in fact, WFRR was my first VHS movie purchase and someday I will purchase the DVD. Like many posters, I adore the masterful, seamless, phantasmagoric merger of live action and animation. Sigh! I think I'll comment upon the main factor that, in my opinion, made WFRR such a success - its matter-of-fact, focused intelligence.It seems strange to call the anarchic, partly animated WFRR world focused and intelligent, but it is. The dialogue is whip-smart, sizzling, and meaningful at every moment, even when a toon is speaking it. The development of the murder mystery involving the death of Acme Products's practical joker king Marvin Acme is appropriately convoluted, twisty, and elusive. The detective Eddie Valiant is still street-smart, shrewd, and clever despite his descent into alcoholism and despair over the murder of his brother (poignantly summarized by a photo montage). Likewise, his transition from enjoying to hating toons because his brother was killed by one. The implication of the goofy Roger Rabbit in Acme's murder because of his supposed dalliance with his stunning human toon wife Jessica Rabbit. The stubbornly growing relationship between Roger and his reluctant protector Eddie. The sinister machinations of the cadaverous Judge Doom. Even the toons' fantastic feats which as Roger explains can occur only if they are funny. Every aspect of the film impresses you with its intelligence, because it is smarter than its audience.WFRR is indeed intelligent, and its intelligence extends to pleasing both kids and adults without being condescending or boring to either. Almost inevitably, this means the movie presents risqué dialogue and situations (e.g. Baby Herman's lament about his 40-year-old lust and his 3-year-old dinky, or Eddie's sometime girlfriend and speakeasy owner Delores commenting on the rabbit extending from his pocket). But the movie is agile and lighthearted enough to avoid offending anyone (unlike, say, Rango). The action, jokes, one-liners, and asides are all sharp and really require you to think.The entire tone of WFRR is smart, too, as well as underplayed and low-key. Even when someone acts crazy, as for example in the climax when Eddie attempts to save Roger and Jessica from being immersed in the dip by...I'm not telling, it has a serious objective. Humans interact with cartoons and sometimes even enter Toontown, the toons's abode, but they never BECOME cartoons. The tone bolsters the underlying serious themes of the movie, which are not only will Roger be acquitted, but also whether Eddie will redeem himself professionally and socially. WFRR will also teach you something about '40s film noir and detective movies, if you are observant.WFRR does something more. Its overall craft and brilliance affirms how great human beings can be, when they set their minds to something.

Gary Senise masterfully directs this tale of two men in search of the American Dream. This movie is a must see because of its rich plot and talented cast who successfully and realistically portray the characters from the book, creating many feelings in the viewers as they watch the movie.The actors are perfectly casted. They successfully and realistically portray the characters from the book. John Malkovich, who played Lennie Smalls is one of the most believable characters in the film. Lennie has the mind of a child and is mentally challenged, and Malkovich completely pulled it off. Also the facial expressions he made were very convincing. When he broke Curley's hand you could see that sense of anger in his eyes, like he truly did want to hurt him. Another character that was convincing was Curley's wife. Curley's wife was constantly flirting with other guy. In the film the director made Curley's wife very attractive, because she was a flirt. She was always with other guys even when she was told not to be by Curley. Her voice was high and it sounded nice and innocent. She fooled all the guys on the farm that she saw, when she said that she was lonely. She had a husband but did not care about him, so she never talked to him. If she talked to him she would not have been so lonely. Sherilyn Fenn's cogent acting made viewers believe that she really was Curley's wife. One other character that did a great performing job was Gary Sinise as George. Throughout the entire movie George showed his love to Lennie; although they fought sometimes, the viewers still knew that he loved him. The two actors were very compatible together. Viewers could see the chemistry between the two actors. Viewers could see the chemistry by how they acted in scenes, their facial expressions and the way they talked to each other. The ending is when you truly knew that he cared. Just before George was about to shoot Lennie he put his head on Lennie's shoulder. This action showed the viewers that he didn't want to shoot him but he had to to protect Lennie from a painful death. As the public watch the film you begin to feel a sense of different emotions as each scene goes by. Although the moviegoers know what is going to happen viewers still feel apprehensiveness, sadness and anger, because the event is not going to obviate from happening. When Curley's wife walks into the barn viewers begin to feel nervous and anxious because they know that Lennie is going to kill her, and they want to see how it is portrayed in the movie when viewers are actually watching it instead of just reading what is written down on paper. People can get the effect of how Senise saw the scene, and the difference from the way the viewers pictured the scene.Another emotion you begin to feel is anger when Carlson shoots Candy's dog. You know that dog is going to die, but patrons get angry because they do not understand why the dog has to die. It's so cute and innocent. You wait for the gunshot to be heard and you wish that it did not have to happen. At the end of the movie when George puts his head on Lennie's shoulder, viewers know that he is going to kill him. Viewers feel sad because they feel bad for Lennie and they also feel heartbroken for George because he truly loves him and to lose a loved one is the worst feeling in the world. The Of Mice and Men film should be recommended to anyone who loves a good story about the true meaning of friendship. The actors, director and the emotions viewers feel, truly make this movie number one. Viewers should commend Senise's adaptation of the film.

Viewers feel sad because they feel bad for Lennie and they also feel heartbroken for George because he truly loves him and to lose a loved one is the worst feeling in the world. The Of Mice and Men film should be recommended to anyone who loves a good story about the true meaning of friendship. The actors, director and the emotions viewers feel, truly make this movie number one. Viewers should commend Senise's adaptation of the film.

The key difference I found was that the book was much sadder. I know it's hard to believe seeing how depressing this movie was but their were many things the director chose not to show. The biggest difference was in the endings. The film leaves you with some since of optimism for these people, the novel does no such thing. The book leaves you with Rosasharn giving birth to a stillborn and offering her breast milk to a man dying of starvation. This obviously could have never been shown in theaters during the 1940's and I'm glad for it. I believe it would have been one powerful scene but the book was way to sad to begin with and the film was pretty depressing as well. Currently we could have handled a film like that just fine but back in the 1940's this was some amazingly heavy stuff. I just think keeping to Steinbeck's original ending would have instilled to much ill feelings in Americans in a time where we needed some optimism. So great film, don't watch it though if you can't handle a little despair though.

It has the same premise of the guests having to stay in a haunted mansion for the night. If they survive the night, they get a large cash sum. Instead of the $10,000 prize in the original, the guests will each receive 1 million dollars for staying alive. There is more of a story in this remake with regards to the house and the tale behind it. Geoffrey Rush plays Stephen Price, an amusement park mogul that loves to terrify people. When his wife Evelyn wants her birthday party to be held in an old asylum, he gives in and invites a few people to the party. The evil spirits end up changing the guest list to one of it's own in an interesting twist revealed later on in the film.The house is actually the Vannacutt Psychiatric Institute for the Criminally Insane which was shut down in the 30's. Dr. Vannacutt would perform grotesque procedures on the patients until eventually the patients revolted, killing many of the nurses and doctors - including Dr. Vannacutt. There are some cool imagery in the whole film with some of the dream sequences and the different torture techniques within the house. The characters are generally likable and the acting is perfect. Geoffrey Rush has great chemistry with Famke Janssen, his on screen wife. She has some good one liners, and Chris Kattan who played the nervous Pritchard character was amazing in the role.This is a pretty cool modern day take on the late 50's classic.

It took me 3 viewings to come to realize that, viewings which I didn't do as a self imposed duty, but jut because I liked AB so much I wouldn't settle for anything less.Now, being aware of the debate going on in these reviews, I don't care if these characters represent 75%, 10% or 1% of the U.S. population as I don't care either if Hamlet's characters truly portrait Middle Ages Danes. All I'm watching here is a film with fictional characters, their lives and their dramas in their suburban universe in a modern city that could be New York, Tokyo or Stockholm (after all, we're living already in a global village, aren't we?). As for myself, Lester, Carolyn, Jane are denizens of our global society, people who you'll find anywhere, in any big city as much as in some rural town in Indonesia or South America, only with different worries, hopes, plans. Now to my review.I loved this movie at first sight, mostly because of 2 things cinematography and characters. Even if unlikable--or despicable for many--I found these last fascinating to watch, if only because of the superb acting overall, the only exception being Ricky's vegetative mom, which I consider superfluous. As for the settings, the camera work, sumptuous is the word that comes to my mind to describe them; at times they made feel just like watching a Shyamalan&#x97;specially during that Janet\/Ricky walk. I was so enthralled by those two said elements that I hardly noticed that almost nothing happens for more than 50 min. until Lester gets fired and Cathy gets on the sack.Now, speaking of Night by an eerie coincidence, just like it happens in a Shyalaman's film, AB comes also with a shocking end twist which explains a lot. Difference is, nobody here seem to have noticed it, despite all the clues the director has left behind. See, we never get neutral confirmation that Angela is beautiful. Quite the contrary. At school other girls treat her like trash, they call her slut and even say she's fat. As for the boys, they don't even look a her, we don't see any of them approaching her. Not even Jane confirms her beauty; she just comments on her behavior, never on her appearance. And why Carolyn didn't say a thing about her looks when introduced to her, even if only out of politeness, when that's the first thing mature women use to say when trying to ingratiate themselves to younger ones? But the true confirmation of her plain physical features comes when she angrily confronts the eloping couple. See how she breaks down in tears when Ricky calls her ugly. Everybody who has, has had, a beautiful girl as relative, friend, knows that a truly pretty girl would never react like that when hearing such a comment, specially coming from a guy she can't even stand. So no further proof is needed Angela is ugly, at least ordinary; she's already more or less in Fatso territory and got no friends, except for Jane. But then, why she appears to us in the charming, alluring, physical features of Mena Suvari? That's called subjective camera-&#x97;that's how I call it anyway.Like I said in my Thin Red Line review, a subjective camera shows us, not what the author sees but what he\/she wants to see. Angela appears in beautiful wrappings because that's how Lester--and nobody else--sees her. The Angela we all see is not the real one, but just the heavenly creature dwelling in his dreams. So not only the dreamy settings&#x97;the bathtub, the red petals--are constructions of his delirious imagination--consequence of his sexual frustration and everyday failures--but also the divine muse inhabiting them. (remember Angela's comment about the couple not having sex in a long time too, when she saw the way he looked at her) If you see this, you'll get why Lester doesn't have the respect of anybody around him--at work or at home&#x97;why he got no friends and why he says he's already dead (falling for the unattractive friend of your teenage daughter, what would you call that... a loser maybe?). When you see this, all pieces fit together and youll see him as the slacker he is, the unfit husband, the lousy father and lover. He's married to a beautiful, sex starved, woman and yet he masturbates; he has hardly talked to his daughter in months and he quits his well paid job to flip burgers(Hey, Lester, how about this crazy idea, I say, of looking for a better job while you still have a good one; or this other crazy concept, of NOT ruining the mood because of a lousy beer bottle?). And all those rambling about what wonderful life they had before is just one more of his fantasies, just another way to fool himself; one that has run its course and for which he has found now an adequate replacement in his present infatuation with Angela. A sad, pathetic, egocentric loser. And see how everything in his world turn around himself, from his very introductory words.Anyway, good movie overall. What I consider superfluous is the gay angle. I have nothing against that type of social advocacy, if it fits harmoniously with the rest of the plot, and that is far from being the case here--and come on guys only out of the closet gays are the happy, well adjusted ones amongst neurotic, miserable, frustrated, heterosexuals?

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"6 April 2011","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" I don't mean Mena Suvari of course but the character itself. The real Angela. Once you get this into the equation everything makes sense, even the first part of my title--except for one thing about which I'll refer later. It took me 3 viewings to come to realize that, viewings which I didn't do as a self imposed duty, but jut because I liked AB so much I wouldn't settle for anything less.Now, being aware of the debate going on in these reviews, I don't care if these characters represent 75%, 10% or 1% of the U.S. population as I don't care either if Hamlet's characters truly portrait Middle Ages Danes. All I'm watching here is a film with fictional characters, their lives and their dramas in their suburban universe in a modern city that could be New York, Tokyo or Stockholm (after all, we're living already in a global village, aren't we?). As for myself, Lester, Carolyn, Jane are denizens of our global society, people who you'll find anywhere, in any big city as much as in some rural town in Indonesia or South America, only with different worries, hopes, plans. Now to my review.I loved this movie at first sight, mostly because of 2 things cinematography and characters. Even if unlikable--or despicable for many--I found these last fascinating to watch, if only because of the superb acting overall, the only exception being Ricky's vegetative mom, which I consider superfluous. As for the settings, the camera work, sumptuous is the word that comes to my mind to describe them; at times they made feel just like watching a Shyamalan&#x97;specially during that Janet\/Ricky walk. I was so enthralled by those two said elements that I hardly noticed that almost nothing happens for more than 50 min. until Lester gets fired and Cathy gets on the sack.Now, speaking of Night by an eerie coincidence, just like it happens in a Shyalaman's film, AB comes also with a shocking end twist which explains a lot. Difference is, nobody here seem to have noticed it, despite all the clues the director has left behind. See, we never get neutral confirmation that Angela is beautiful. Quite the contrary. At school other girls treat her like trash, they call her slut and even say she's fat. As for the boys, they don't even look a her, we don't see any of them approaching her. Not even Jane confirms her beauty; she just comments on her behavior, never on her appearance. And why Carolyn didn't say a thing about her looks when introduced to her, even if only out of politeness, when that's the first thing mature women use to say when trying to ingratiate themselves to younger ones? But the true confirmation of her plain physical features comes when she angrily confronts the eloping couple. See how she breaks down in tears when Ricky calls her ugly. Everybody who has, has had, a beautiful girl as relative, friend, knows that a truly pretty girl would never react like that when hearing such a comment, specially coming from a guy she can't even stand. So no further proof is needed Angela is ugly, at least ordinary; she's already more or less in Fatso territory and got no friends, except for Jane. But then, why she appears to us in the charming, alluring, physical features of Mena Suvari? That's called subjective camera-&#x97;that's how I call it anyway.Like I said in my Thin Red Line review, a subjective camera shows us, not what the author sees but what he\/she wants to see. Angela appears in beautiful wrappings because that's how Lester--and nobody else--sees her. The Angela we all see is not the real one, but just the heavenly creature dwelling in his dreams. So not only the dreamy settings&#x97;the bathtub, the red petals--are constructions of his delirious imagination--consequence of his sexual frustration and everyday failures--but also the divine muse inhabiting them. (remember Angela's comment about the couple not having sex in a long time too, when she saw the way he looked at her) If you see this, you'll get why Lester doesn't have the respect of anybody around him--at work or at home&#x97;why he got no friends and why he says he's already dead (falling for the unattractive friend of your teenage daughter, what would you call that... a loser maybe?). When you see this, all pieces fit together and youll see him as the slacker he is, the unfit husband, the lousy father and lover. He's married to a beautiful, sex starved, woman and yet he masturbates; he has hardly talked to his daughter in months and he quits his well paid job to flip burgers(Hey, Lester, how about this crazy idea, I say, of looking for a better job while you still have a good one; or this other crazy concept, of NOT ruining the mood because of a lousy beer bottle?). And all those rambling about what wonderful life they had before is just one more of his fantasies, just another way to fool himself; one that has run its course and for which he has found now an adequate replacement in his present infatuation with Angela. A sad, pathetic, egocentric loser. And see how everything in his world turn around himself, from his very introductory words.Anyway, good movie overall. What I consider superfluous is the gay angle. I have nothing against that type of social advocacy, if it fits harmoniously with the rest of the plot, and that is far from being the case here--and come on guys only out of the closet gays are the happy, well adjusted ones amongst neurotic, miserable, frustrated, heterosexuals?

Because for all the interpretations that have surfaced about what exactly this film is telling us, not one can be confirmed&#x85;or ruled out. Maybe it's a criticism of consumerism; a world of advertising that bombards us with images of who 'they' want us to be with such ferocity that we start to believe it. Maybe it's urging us to break free of the constraints of society, a society we're supposed to fear, admire, respect, serve, and live life free. Or maybe it's just so satiric that the preacher himself, Tyler Durden, with his too-cool hairstyle and nightclub-junkie sunglasses, exists only to parody the very nature of anarchy, a lying hypocrite constantly firing useless one-liners and incoherent 'philosophy.'Whatever Fight Club is about, it is a masterpiece of modern cinema. Based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, director David Fincher has created a dangerous film that exposes the intense power of the will to change one's life. The unnamed narrator (Edward Norton) is stuck in a dead-end job and attends support groups for the terminally ill just to feel some emotion in his life. There he meets the mysterious and twisted Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) who has the same problem. Desperate to make something of his existence before he dies, an encounter with eccentric soap salesman Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) gives the narrator exactly the chance he needs.The characterisation of all three main characters is extraordinary. One could argue each actor gives a career-best performance, adding immeasurable weight to the film's message, whatever it may be. Norton's deadpan narration of every painstaking moment of his life doesn't so much justify his actions as it emphasises them. Pitt's character is the one that benefits most from a brilliantly unique script that never fails to impress, full of refreshing dialogue and devoid of any clichés. Meanwhile, the consistently underrated Carter brings the vampiric Marla to life (no pun intended), giving a marvellous turn as the narrator's morbid love interest who envies the dead and preys on those close to joining them.I regard this movie as highly as I do because, just like the characters themselves, it relishes in breaking all the rules. Where other movies follow a set system of guidelines that eventually result in a film falling into one or two genres, Fight Club dosen't try to classify itself, but instead tells its story without letting convention get in the way. The film is driven solely by the narrator's recollection of what he and Tyler built, and if he wants to backtrack, stop time or ignore something he'd rather not pay attention to, then the audience is forced to do the same.Fincher makes it very clear that we shouldn't forget that what is on-screen is fiction, and that allows him to play with all sorts of fourth-wall-breaking techniques. This gives the film a unique touch rarely seen in movies past and present, but more importantly, it gives the viewer perfect reason to suspend their disbelief, especially when things get more sinister towards the Third Act. For better or for worse, the vast majority of people will remember Fight Club for its blindsiding twist ending, a moment recognised in pop culture so frequently it is almost impossible not to know it even without watching the film. Regardless, I urge anyone who has yet to see it to give Fight Club their full attention. And even if you can't decide upon exactly what it means after the first screening (like me), you can at least marvel at the surreal cinematography, threatening performances from all involved, and the efforts it took to create a film so steeped in fan-dividing social commentary, psychology and satire all at the same time. *There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

For Linklater, it's taking everyday moments and routine things and making them raw or magical. The fact that you can see something that could be so average in a different light means that he has indeed succeeded at what he planned on doing all along.Before Sunrise is the third film I have seen from his repertoire. One could say he has even changed the romantic drama genre with this film. The relationship that develops between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is truly mesmerizing and one of a kind. The thing is, I can see where some people may dislike this film. It focuses solely on their character attributes and what their beliefs are. There is also heavy focus on dialog. It may also seem like a true slow-burn kind of film to many, but I think it paces itself rather well. It is a true testament to character development and the loving relationship we all wish to have; the reason why many of us go to the movies, adoring the celebrity folk on screen, wishing we could sometimes fall in love with the real-life versions of the characters they play. The performances that Hawke and Delpy turn in are memorable and you can't help but feel a part of their conversation as the movie goes on.Linklater's sequel Before Sunset does the entire story justice too.

For Linklater, it's taking everyday moments and routine things and making them raw or magical. The fact that you can see something that could be so average in a different light means that he has indeed succeeded at what he planned on doing all along.Before Sunrise is the third film I have seen from his repertoire. One could say he has even changed the romantic drama genre with this film. The relationship that develops between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is truly mesmerizing and one of a kind. The thing is, I can see where some people may dislike this film. It focuses solely on their character attributes and what their beliefs are. There is also heavy focus on dialog. It may also seem like a true slow-burn kind of film to many, but I think it paces itself rather well. It is a true testament to character development and the loving relationship we all wish to have; the reason why many of us go to the movies, adoring the celebrity folk on screen, wishing we could sometimes fall in love with the real-life versions of the characters they play. The performances that Hawke and Delpy turn in are memorable and you can't help but feel a part of their conversation as the movie goes on.Linklater's sequel Before Sunset does the entire story justice too.
