The man has such a reputation that if you don't like one his films, you're just not getting it or there's something wrong with you. Mostly this reputation is well-earned as his movies are extremely good and well-made, but sometimes this expectation to love a film causes sort of a backslash where you're fighting against the film, critiquing every little detail, not allowing it to pull you in. Thus I think that I did myself sort of a disfavour with Rear Window. I liked it quite much, but my expectations were too high.What did the movie get right? The characters for one. The main couple of Jeff (James Stewart) and Lisa (Grace Kelly) is the centerpiece of the entire film and these two actors pull it off beautifully. The characters are quite different, but both actors play them quite similarly by adding a lot of charisma to them, as well as an underlying streak of good humour. With Lisa this streak is quite visible at times, as she is almost always smiling and a pleasant person in general. With Jeff it's a bit more subtle, but Stewart plays the character like he's usually quite a charmer, but now that he's been forced to spend several weeks indoors, he has become quite grumpy as a result. Very subtle performances from both, as is to be expected from two stars such as them.Furthermore the various inhabitants of Jeff's neighbourhood are also quite interesting and given a lot of character, even though most of them only have a few lines of dialogue, if even that. But Jeff has spent weeks observing them and we see them through his eyes, which makes them more real and gives them colour. The names, such as Miss Lonely Heart and Miss Torso are especially telling.I also quite liked the themes that got addressed throughout the film. The film has surprising amount of depth, considering that the premise itself is quite simple. A man notices that something is amiss with his neighbours and decides to investigate. With a lesser director that would have been all, but Hitchcock adds in a lot more without making it feel clustered. The obvious mystery plot is still the main attraction, but the film has lots to say about relationships, neighbourhoods and human character in general. And none of these themes feel forced or preaching. A lot isn't even said aloud, rather various shots and visuals are used to both introduce the characters and to deepen their personalities. This leaves more time for meaningful dialogue because it isn't needed to force in exposition.What wasn't so hot in my opinion, so to speak? The main mystery, frankly speaking. Of course this is such a classic film that it's hard to see it without knowing how it's going to go beforehand, but I still would have liked for it to have been a little more complicated and\/or deeper. Now the problem is introduced and at least I deduced instantly what had happened. Thus the main conflict isn't really finding out what happened, but finding out how they're going to prove it. Perhaps Hitchcock meant it to be like this, but I would have preferred a bit more ambiguity. The story itself isn't all that bad and it is told masterfully, with no motions or scenes wasted, but the mystery is overly simplified. For me that was a problem, but it doesn't mean that it will be so for everyone.Final thoughts It's a strong film because of its characters, its skillful technical details and its sheer flawlessness. The mystery plot might leave you wishing for more, but it's not an outright flaw, rather than a matter of opinion. So I quite liked the film, though I wouldn't call it one of the best films of all time, like some do. It's great, but not that great.

Oh, and then there's the outcast scientist who's illegally experimenting on a paralyzed young woman named Frances.Yeah&#x97;it's every bit as random as it sounds. How the escape of the ape in question correlates with this doctor's ethical quandary is hazy to say the least, and the behavior of the townspeople is just as weird. Apparently, they're all scared of this doctor because he practices medicine in an unorthodox manner (that's about as much details as we're given). In fact, even the kids around town hate him; so much so that he catches them pelting his house with rocks. In any case, the good doctor is forced to treat a circus trainer who was attacked by the beast in question. The doctor draws some spinal fluid from the dying man, injects it in his paralyzed patient, and marvels at her ability to begin twitching her hitherto unresponsive feet. Meanwhile, the escaped animal breaks into the doctor's house; during the chaos, the aging practitioner throws some sort of liquid in the ape's face and then stabs it with a knife (and, we assume, kills it). What's really weird is that he informs his mute assistant that no one in town should know the gorilla is dead. This seems to have a sinister motivation at first, but we later discover that the doctor begins dressing as the ape (I think? Or maybe he skinned it and then made a suit?) in an effort to motivate Frances to finally stand on her own two feet&#x97;*cough, cough*&#x97;and prove that his research had scientific credence all along.Uh-huh.In short, this is a movie that uses the presence of a lumbering ape to try and add an element of horror to an otherwise straightforward&#x97;and boring&#x97;story about a renegade scientist who's misunderstood.

The man accuses the doctor of breaking all sorts of ethical codes. How does the scientist respond? He suggests that the official see the result of his research, and takes the man to visit Frances. The official requests that Frances prove she's recovering from her Polio by wiggling a foot. She can't do it. Based on all of this you would assume the mad scientist is in deep doo doo, right?Wrong. Instead, right when it seems that our anti-hero is about to be taken into custody, the official says, Well, she didn't move her foot. But I definitely noticed a muscular reflex. Congratulations, doctor! Umm&#x85; what?These sorts of occurrences plague The Ape, making it one of the most eye-rolling attempts at scary film making to have ever come down the pike.

How the escape of the ape in question correlates with this doctor's ethical quandary is hazy to say the least, and the behavior of the townspeople is just as weird. Apparently, they're all scared of this doctor because he practices medicine in an unorthodox manner (that's about as much details as we're given). In fact, even the kids around town hate him; so much so that he catches them pelting his house with rocks. In any case, the good doctor is forced to treat a circus trainer who was attacked by the beast in question. The doctor draws some spinal fluid from the dying man, injects it in his paralyzed patient, and marvels at her ability to begin twitching her hitherto unresponsive feet. Meanwhile, the escaped animal breaks into the doctor's house; during the chaos, the aging practitioner throws some sort of liquid in the ape's face and then stabs it with a knife (and, we assume, kills it). What's really weird is that he informs his mute assistant that no one in town should know the gorilla is dead. This seems to have a sinister motivation at first, but we later discover that the doctor begins dressing as the ape (I think? Or maybe he skinned it and then made a suit?) in an effort to motivate Frances to finally stand on her own two feet&#x97;*cough, cough*&#x97;and prove that his research had scientific credence all along.Uh-huh.In short, this is a movie that uses the presence of a lumbering ape to try and add an element of horror to an otherwise straightforward&#x97;and boring&#x97;story about a renegade scientist who's misunderstood. It's the classic he's-got-good-intentions-and-we-should-all-feel-like-jackasses- for-doubting-him tale.There are plenty of chances for the film to be inventive, but it suffers from a particularly bad case of convenient circumstances; you know, the sort of thing that happens at just the right time to allow the narrative to move forward in an absolutely unbelievable way.Case in point an official from the institute that trained the doctor shows up to investigate strange occurrences in the town. The man accuses the doctor of breaking all sorts of ethical codes. How does the scientist respond? He suggests that the official see the result of his research, and takes the man to visit Frances. The official requests that Frances prove she's recovering from her Polio by wiggling a foot. She can't do it. Based on all of this you would assume the mad scientist is in deep doo doo, right?Wrong. Instead, right when it seems that our anti-hero is about to be taken into custody, the official says, Well, she didn't move her foot. But I definitely noticed a muscular reflex. Congratulations, doctor! Umm&#x85; what?These sorts of occurrences plague The Ape, making it one of the most eye-rolling attempts at scary film making to have ever come down the pike. But, like a lot of the B offerings from this era, it does have its moments of unintentional humor. Because of that, I'll award it half a star.

Even if Robert Altman is exaggerating about how loose this was, it is amazing how much of this was done essentially the fly and assembled in the editing room. The musical film follows country, gospel music stars, and 24 near normal people in Nashville, TN. The movie is full of musical numbers, and multiple story lines. Having 24 characters in a movie for the audience to watch, and care is hard to follow. It get somewhat confusing, and the story only have a overaching story arc with each character trying to become somebody. Most of the characters come together at Parthenon in Nashville to witness a outdoor concert for a populist running for President of the United States on the Replacement Party ticket. The overarching plot takes place over five days leading up to a political candidate Hal Phillip Walker ralley, who is never seen throughout the entire movie. Hal Phillip Walker's folksy political aphorisms is mixed with overblown songs juxtaposed with country superstar intended to commemorate the upcoming Bicentennial. The most popular country singer is Barbara Jean (Ronee Blakley) just return to Nashville who just agree to join the ralley despite having health issues and the 'Main' Main character. Barbara Jean continue to struggle in her return to the point that she refuse to sing songs, and rather rambling stories about her childhood. After several false starts, Barnett escorts her from the stage and tells the disappointed audience that they can come to the Parthenon tomorrow and see Barbara Jean perform for free, thus committing her to the Walker concert. Without spoiling the end-- the Climax at the Walker concert is one of the most deep movie ending ever. It's still chilling to watch even today. Other key characters are Opal (Geraldine Chaplin) a wacky, celebrity-obsessed, self-absorbed radio reporter. As a surrogate for the audience, she provides an outsider's perspective on the business of music. She is never seen with a film crew, to the point she may not even be a filmmaker but just a groupie who uses fake credentials to gain access to famous people.

The movie has some of the best songs, Since You've Gone This beautiful song, performed by the fictional folk trio Tom, Bill and Mary written for the film by Gary Busey. Weird. The whole sub-plot affair between Tom Frank (Keith Carradine) and Lennea Reese (Lily Tomkins) can be solve by the song 'I'm Easy which won Best Original Song at the Academy Award. This song still holds up and to think that it was actually written by an actor like Keith Carridine. Such a poignant moment in the film. He had all those girls fooled into thinking he liked them individually and he called up another gal while Lily Tomlin's character was getting ready to leave. Lily's face near the end is absolutely heartbreaking, that scene had to have gotten her the Oscar nomination.Carradine also wrote It Don't Worry Me, which is heard on the soundtrack throughout the film, and is the closing number performed by Barbara Harris onstage at the Parthenon. She sang it beautiful, it's a shame Barbara Harris didn't go on to greater things - she's a country gem. She plays as an aspiring singer-songwriter who failures to get a break, comes in the end, and opportunity is calling. Sueleen Gay, leaning against the post watching Harris performs, coming to grips with the fact that her big break is not happening. But still patiently waiting for it.

As shocked as I was by this, I have to give credit where it's due. Kudos to The Blob and everyone associated with it for making such a gutsy decision. This sort of thing actually causes the film to garner a fair amount of suspense if you know children aren't even safe, then logic would dictate that anyone could be picked off at any time. And that's exactly what happens. You'll simultaneously gasp and laugh as the amorphous slime traverses sewers and street corners in an effort to digest every living thing in the immediate vicinity. That, I think, is one of the things that makes this decidedly over-the-top horror movie work so well it's not about a guy in a hockey mask trying to carve up people. The antagonist doesn't have any backstory, and isn't motivated by emotion, revenge, etc. It's a relatively primitive being (in terms of intelligence, at least) that wants to eat. It's acting on sheer primal instinct, and that's it.Had this been the entirety of the plot, there's a strong chance that The Blob would've elicited an exceptionally strong cult following. But there's a twist the meteorite that fell to Earth was not, in fact, a meteorite. As it turns out, it was a well-disguised American bioweapon satellite. In the latter half of the film it's explained that the blob started out as a small culture of bacteria which mutated due to the absence of gravity. Instead of the blob being a completely awesome alien life form, it's nothing more than the result of an attempt to overpower Russia via the use of biological warfare. How lame is that?As insignificant as this plot point may seem, it really hampers the overall effect of the movie. It's completely unnecessary, and feels as if it's the ultimate form of contrivance. I mean, let's face it the movie is called The Blob. People are paying to see it because they want to see horrific deaths filled with gore and cheese. No one goes into a movie like this expecting political commentary, and, unless it's handled in exactly the right way, it comes off as a botched attempt at adding subtext to a movie that doesn't need any.So where does that leave us? The fact remains that The Blob is a well made horror movie with great effects. It's fun, engrossing, and entirely creative&#x97;well, at least for 3\/4 of the runtime. It's certainly worth a rental on a night you want to watch something mindless with a group of friends, and I'd recommend serving a little Jell-O to enhance the already heightened level of corniness that is about to *er-hem* consume you.

","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"26 December 2012","score":"","review":" Let me get this out of the way first The Blob&#x97;a remake of the 1958 flick bearing the same name&#x97;isn't that bad. In fact, it's actually pretty good. It never takes itself too seriously, and it features some of the most grotesque (and inventive) death scenes to come out of the 80\u2032s (which is saying a lot, as any subscriber to the macabre will tell you that the 1980s was one of the most prolific periods for this oft- unappreciated genre). That being said, I've decided to review it solely because it's the exact type of movie one would find dwelling underneath a mountain of $2.99 DVDs at Wal-Mart. An uneducated person might dismiss it as being just another low budget snooze-fest, but that uneducated person would, of course, be incorrect in his\/her assumptions about this surprisingly fun movie that was penned by none another than Frank Darabont (and a handful of others).The Blob is about well a blob. A meteorite crashes on the outskirts of a small Colorado town, and the only person&#x97;at least for the time being&#x97;to notice its presence is a homeless man who spends his day crushing cans and playing with his dog. When he investigates the fiery crash site, he finds little more than a piece of smoldering rock. But wait&#x97;what's that gelatinous substance pulsing in the center of said meteorite? Only a sane person would pick up a stick and poke it, right? Of course. That's exactly what this gentleman does, only to have the ooze spring to life and attach itself to his hand. He's soon aided by the resident juvenile delinquent (who, of course, turns out not to be such a bad guy after all), a football star, and a cheerleader. Yeah, that's right the traditional teenage fodder is present and accounted for in The Blob. Thankfully, though, the blob is an equal opportunity eater. No one is safe.And I mean no one.In an unprecedented move&#x97;and one that's usually regarded as a cardinal sin in the world of horror movies&#x97;a child is eventually killed and digested by the blob. As shocked as I was by this, I have to give credit where it's due. Kudos to The Blob and everyone associated with it for making such a gutsy decision. This sort of thing actually causes the film to garner a fair amount of suspense if you know children aren't even safe, then logic would dictate that anyone could be picked off at any time. And that's exactly what happens. You'll simultaneously gasp and laugh as the amorphous slime traverses sewers and street corners in an effort to digest every living thing in the immediate vicinity. That, I think, is one of the things that makes this decidedly over-the-top horror movie work so well it's not about a guy in a hockey mask trying to carve up people.

How many people don't know who you mean when you say...Ralphie and his BB Gun, or the leg lamp, or the pink nightmare? Christmas movies probably have a much better chance of becoming classics that get watched every year but there are likely as many completely forgotten too but A Christmas Story is not one of those. I think I've pinpointed the love of this film. First of all, the movie is not a family Christmas movie per se as it does have some bad language but adults love it because they can find something in it to relate too. The film is so brilliantly written that you feel like you are living the life of this little boy. The adult narration in his head is just awesome, and hilarious and the entire experiences that he goes through are fun to watch and completely memorable. Although the film is known for being about him wanted that BB gun, that is such a small part of the bigger picture. Its not a coming of age story but rather a being of age story. As with most classics everything just clicks and works so well and you can watch it again and again like a home movie of your own and feel the same warm fuzzy feeling.The discovery and casting of Peter Billingsley was sheer brilliance. Billingsley doesn't have a ton of lines in the film because so much of what goes on is the adult voice in his head. This makes him even better a performer because he has to react to the voice and to the things going on around him and he is perfect. He gives a top notch performance. Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin are amazing, memorable, and legendary as Ralphie's parents. They have such unique personalities and you can't help but laugh and smile at their antics. They just light up every scene they are in. Jean Shepherd is the adult voice of Ralphie and he does so with complete ease and utter perfection. He is an adult making everything sound like he's experiencing things as a child and it is perfect for the movie. He literally embodies Ralph as much as Billingsley does. Scott Schwartz, Ian Petrella, RD Robb, and Zack Ward all are brilliant in small doses as Ralphie's peers. None of them have big moments, some of them have very few lines and yet they are all so integral to the story and they all get at least one moment to shine.Bob Clark has had such a mixed back to his direction credit. But there is one thing he knows and that's 80s comedy. He helped take A Christmas Story to epic proportions that nearly everyone holds dear. The movie is, simply put, hilarious fun. You will feel their pain, their memories, their family and the best Christmas they've ever had. I can't say enough about this film because if you haven't seen it, you're likely in a minority and if you have then you likely know exactly what I mean.

Taking this long to see what many consider to be the horror movie to end all horror movies is a travesty; trust me, I know. Over the years I had caught bits and pieces of it on television, but for some reason I just never took the time out of my oh-so-busy schedule to sit down and watch the whole thing from start to finish.After making a hasty decision to watch it very late one night via my Netflix Instant Queue, I found that all of the hearsay surrounding this 1973 classic is true. It's extraordinarily creepy, unsettling, and well done.Max von Sydow plays Father Merrin, a Catholic priest who moonlights as an archaeologist. It turns out that he's also one of the foremost experts on possessions and exorcisms.When Reagan, the daughter of a wealthy actress who resides in Washington D.C., is possessed by an evil spirit that claims to be none other than Satan himself, a long and winding road develops that will eventually lead a weathered old priest and a demon-possessed child to a meeting that is nothing short of bone- chilling. I'm getting a little ahead of myself, though, so let's back things up.Reagan, a 12 year-old who lives with her mother in a Georgetown area townhouse, gradually begins to exhibit increasingly erratic (and wholly bizarre) behavior. Her mother, Chris MacNeil (played by Ellen Burstyn), consults a large variety of medical professionals to try and determine what's causing the strange outbursts&#x97;which, by the way, entail sporadically cursing God and inflicting brutal physical damage on herself and others.Part of what makes The Exorcist work so well is the realistic handling of this situation by Chris (she immediately contacts a wide variety of medical professionals). Very few people would immediately think, Okay&#x97; my daughter is possessed and consult religious authorities as a primary reaction. The doctors who try to treat Reagan all approach this from a very scientific, logos-oriented standpoint too; their initial diagnosis is that she has a legion on her brain that's causing the erratic and violent behavior. After undergoing a series of gruesome tests to try and identify the location of said elusive legion, the doctors find that, physiologically, she's in full working order. Frustrated and baffled at the lack of competence these physicians have displayed, Chris starts to enter panic mode. Reluctantly, one doctor eventually suggests that Reagan is the victim of supernatural influences, and, as a last resort, Chris gets in touch with a local priest by the name of Father Karras. Karras is a well-educated man who is immediately skeptical of the supposed possession of Reagan, but he agrees to visit her and assess the situation himself. After a series of harrowing encounters with demon- Reagan, Karras, with the blessing of the Catholic church, teams up with Merrin in an attempt to drive away the evil spirit.The plot, as you've no doubt noticed, is pretty bare bones, but, like any truly scary tale regarding the paranormal, it works because it's handled with thoughtfulness and sincerity. All of the actors display a true sense of urgency in regards to the seriousness of Reagan's situation, and the acting of Blair (who, of course, was only a child at the time) is phenomenal. As Father Karras repeatedly visits and tries to learn more about who (or what) has taken over Reagan, said evil influence begins to bore into Karras' mind. Slowly, it's revealed that Karras is plagued with guilt in regards to his recently deceased mother. She passed away after he made the decision to place her in a nursing home, and Satan (or whoever is in Reagan) methodically mines that guilt until Karras is on the verge of completely losing it. The psychological horror utilized in The Exorcist is supremely scary, and this, along with many other things, helps elevate it above any other possession movie that's ever been made.Added to the effect of this is the fact that The Exorcist builds tension better than almost any other horror movie. As people approach the door to Reagan's bedroom, the sense of foreboding terror that lurks just beyond what you can see is palpable&#x97;you'll literally find the hair standing up on the back of your neck as you're pleading for whichever character to just hurry up and throw the door open so you'll be able to breathe again.And, of course, The Exorcist has many scenes that exist for no other reason than to totally freak you out. The head-turn sequence comes to mind first, and is closely followed by the stomach-turning pea soup vomit scene and the crab-walk-down-the-stairs bit that's found in the director's cut.I feel immensely guilty myself for not having scene this until the ripe old age of 27. If you consider yourself a horror aficionado and have never seen it, then go out and rent it right now&#x97;just be prepared to keep a crucifix and a vial of holy water next to your bed after you've developed a legitimate fear of the thumping sound coming from your attic.

Songlian (played by Li Gong) is my heroine. Not the I- wanna-inject-you-and-listen-to-jazz heroin, but a sad and lonely victim of circumstance rebelling against her fate.The opening scene is Songlian's face, worthy of any Miss China pageant, as a single tear rolls down her cheek she coldly states, Become a concubine - isn't that a woman's fate? Yeah, it's gonna be bleak.Each night, the elusive Master will choose 1 of 4 mistresses to bunk with and a flourish of red lanterns are lit outside mistress numero uno's house - enough lanterns to be seen from orbit. Why? As this is tradition. The chosen concubine is served her favourite dish that night. As is tradition. The mistress will receive a strange foot massage. As is tradition. She will be bed by the master and lavished with his attention. As is tradition. Surely as Songlian is Master's newest object of affection he should favour her, yet there are petty forces working against her bitchier than your worst enemy from high school. Each mistress has manipulative ways in which they try to woo to the master. Because they love him? Not even.

Once again diving headlong into this ballet of desert highway carnage was like getting reacquainted with an old friend; consequently, this has caused me to lament the stale-by- comparison state of many recent road rage thrillers offered up by Hollywood.If you've never seen Breakdown, it could be described as a more intelligent version of Joy Ride (or, perhaps, The Hitcher). It's about a married couple named Jeff (Russell) and Amy (Quinlan) who are driving cross country&#x97;from Boston to San Diego&#x97;to take on more lucrative employment opportunities. Along the way, they almost collide with a local in a pick-up truck on a remote desert highway. When they stop at the next gas station, the fella driving the truck&#x97;a black-clad hombre with a handlebar mustache and a cowboy hat&#x97;proceeds to chew out Jeff for his idiotic behavior behind the wheel. The two eventually call a truce, part ways, and go about their lives. It's not long, however, before Jeff's brand new Jeep inexplicably breaks down. As the couple is trying to assess the situation, a man in an 18-wheeler stops, offers assistance, and eventually ends up suggesting the pair ride with him to the nearest town so they can call a tow truck. Jeff is leery about leaving his car on the side of a highway with a local lunatic on the prowl, so Amy hops in the semi, presumably to wait for her husband at a diner as he figures out what to do. Once she leaves, Jeff discovers the problem, fixes the car, and heads to the diner. When he gets there, though, Amy is nowhere to be found. The locals have no idea who she is, and they all claim to have never seen her. What ensues is a maddeningly wild goose chase across barren southwestern terrain as Jeff does everything in his power to find his spouse.There are twists and turns aplenty, and the action is great. The most disturbing thing about the film is how genuine it all seems.

One is about a mummy that kills, the second is about an attacking feline, and the third tells the tale of a murdering gargoyle. I've always loved these type of horror movies that tells multiple stories within it. Some others that come to mind are Tales from the Crypt (1972), Cat's Eye and Trilogy of Terror. Like the 1972 flick Tales From the Crypt', this film has a main plot that surrounds the tales told. The plot for this one is of a little boy who is being held captive by a beautiful housewife who plans on serving him for dinner at her house party. The little boy tries to stall her plans by reading the three stories from the book 'Tales from the Darkside'.The first story (Lot 249) is about a mummy who is brought back to life by a college student who wants revenge on those who have wronged\/bullied him. The mummy kills the students in horrific ways, and the tale ends with a decent twist. The second story (The Cat From Hell) shows an old man named Drogan hiring a hit man named Halston to kill a cat. According to Drogan, the black cat is responsible for the death of his sister and two others. He offers the Halston $100,000 to kill the cat. So basically the whole tale revolves around Halston chasing the cat around the huge mansion, leading up to a pretty gruesome finale. The final story (Lover's Vow) is about a guy named Preston who witnesses another man getting slaughtered by a gargoyle one night in a New York alleyway. The gargoyle tells him that if he ever told anyone of what he saw, it would come back and kill him too! That same night, he meets a beautiful woman who he ends up falling in love with. A year later Preston makes the fatal mistake of telling her what he saw that night, leading to one hell of a twist that frightened me the first time I saw it.The last story is the best of all three. It has a good story to it, lots of gore, and an interesting little twist at the end. The weakest of the bunch for me would have to be The Cat from Hell. It was just to ridiculous for me, this cat running around with a professional hit-man not being able to capture it. There was definitely a lot of blood and gore in this film, we get a decapitated head and a cat who goes inside of a person's mouth and rests in their stomach. The wraparound story with the woman trying to cook the kid was decent, nothing special but nothing to complain about.The acting was pretty good with some big names leading the way (Christian Slater\/Julianne Moore\/Deborah Harry). Overall, Tales From The Darkside The Movie is an average horror film. I am a fan of the original TV series, I'd rate them above this film. The 'Lover's Vow' story was the best one, the other two lacked a bit and dragged on a little. I guess I'd recommend it for horror anthology fans.

It isn't as good as 'Tales from the Crypt (1972)' or 'Creephow', but it has it's moments.6\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"26 December 2012","score":"","review":" While I believe a great film can be updated to fit more recent times, the 1994 remake of the 1947 classic Miracle on 34th Street is an example of how good intentions can go astray.I thought Richard Attenborough did a fine job in the lead role.

They appeared in a Catholic church after midnight Mass and the priest was happy to marry them even though they obviously had not agreed to get married beforehand. This isn't Las Vegas. Any normal minister on seeing that the couple had not really planned on getting married, but were just then considering it, would have wanted to wait until they were sure before performing a ceremony.What really hurt was that most of the scenes from the original that made it such a fun film were eliminated in the remake. The comical interaction between Kris and Susan as he tried to let her learn to pretend, and, most significantly, the great courtroom scene where all the huge bags of mail were carried in, convincing the judge that the postal service considers Kris to be Santa were not in the remake.In fact, the big courtroom scene had the judge all ready with his verdict, then, on seeing one familiar phrase on the back of a dollar bill, suddenly rendering a totally different verdict on a rather flimsy bit of logic.

It is a classic so well camouflaged in a mix of genres, i.e., War Movie, Sci-Fi, Horror, Murder Mystery, to name a few, that it doesn't even know its a classic! This even grants the film a certain amount of humility concerning its intentions. It is an action flick with the apparent gravitas of a Sgt. Rock comic book, that upon repeated viewings inspires some truly deep thinking. It's the little action adventure movie that didn't think it could and didn't even bother trying to do anything beyond entertaining its audience that somehow lumbers beyond the limitations of genre expectations to serve up food for thought as well as grist for the gore mill. It is a film I could have easily seen Joe Kubert or Jack Kirby doing the storyboards for that is peopled with musclemen who blindly wrestle their way into an end zone of unexpected deliverance. 'Predator' rocks with enough visceral thrills for any 'action junkie' and yet is deeply satisfying intellectually in this gruff, offhand Hemingwayesque way. It made me nod with the slowly dawning realization of having finished a well-sanded project in wood shop.'Predator' is an essay on machoism in all its most laudable and cartoonish aspects and that is what makes it such satisfying storytelling. The very beginning of the movie looks like a few seconds of some unknown Sci-Fi flick spliced onto the beginning of a standard Vietnam War movie dedicated to exploits of martial valor. It almost feels like a glitch in editing, as though somebody grabbed the wrong reel. Arnold Schwarzenegger swaggers out of a landed helicopter chomping a cigar backed by a team of ace commandos. You expect Chuck Norris to arrive at any moment. He meets with Carl Weathers, also chomping a cigar, and after some playful arm wrestling as a way of saying 'Hello', then gets down to being briefed about the mission at hand.Schwarzenegger eventually finds out that Weathers has him employing his team and combat tactics under false pretenses and that the mission has different objectives from those stated by Weathers. What Weathers doesn't know is that his 'mission' is about to be preempted for the sporting pleasure of a visitor from another world. After that, it's the hunt and the chase and the fight against an unseen adversary who at times seems everywhere and yet nowhere. The beauty of this film is watching the macho postures of the various lead characters slowly deconstruct and dissolve into expressions of alarm and dread or simply screams of terror and agony when it's their turn to have their ticket punched.When Schwarzenegger finally gets some idea of what's killing off his team one member at a time, he becomes an archetypal hero that Natty Bumpo or James Fenimore Cooper would be proud to welcome into the fold. This is the film 'Conan the Barbarian' should have been, but never could be. It is about the past, present and future of manly virtue or machismo, but only as a disturbing afterthought.

You get to see many characters that you heard about growing up as a child. Tim Burton covers every aspect of Halloween. The music by Danny Elfman is fabulous and very catchy. Once you watch it, you will want to watch it over and over again. One thing I liked about this movie is that, you get to see three different worlds. It isn't focused on just one particular holiday like some are. I didn't give it a 10 out of 10 because I wish the movie could have lasted longer and really showed in depth the Christmas world. Other than that, the movie was fabulous! I recommend it to anyone! ","genre":"Animation, Family, Fantasy"}]
