They are not even well organized as money making criminals. They take tremendous risks and don't even hide their tracks. Being run after by the cops is fun and they can kill one from time to time, a pregnant young female cop if possible. We have fully entered the modern criminal urban civil war and we better move our heads and rake our brains if we do not want them to take over whole neighborhoods where the law is going to be their law.

Even the DVD informs you its the thriller all others are measured against. Although I did enjoy TSOTL, I'm not sure if it has the components necessary to make it a true classic. Its not the masterpiece it's often made out to be.Certainly you can understand its appeal. Its a story that comes with a rich premise ripe for delving into dark, psychological corners. Thomas Harris' novel was a wonderfully compelling page-turner. A tightly wound thriller that sent my pulse racing.But the film skates over some of the things that made Harris' novel so wonderful. I'm not saying its a terrible film. Far from it. Jonathan Demme's direction is excellent, with lots of brilliant camera tricks. And he gets a superb performance out of Jodie Foster. Clarice Starling is the best thing she's ever done. She won a well deserved Oscar for the part. But still, the film doesn't always satisfy like it should.Everyone knows the story. FBI trainee Starling is assigned to glean information from incarcerated serial killer, Dr Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) concerning the whereabouts of another serial killer on the loose, Buffalo Bill. A former patient of Lecters, he's killed and skinned several women. Starling and Lecter's interrogation sessions become a slowly spreading invasion within the background of Starling's emotionally fragile psyche. All the while Buffalo Bill has himself a new victim, and Lecter is already planning his escape.First I will praise the film's merits. Yes it does have excellent performances. The scenes between Starling and Lecter are electrifying. They're the high-point of the whole film. And Demme does superb things with his camera. I like the way he shoots many of Clarice's scenes from her POV, like when she descends several staircases and goes through several doors at the asylum until she finally meets Dr Lecter.He stands straight. Perfectly still. Almost waiting in anticipation for Clarice. They lock eyes. He reads things about her. From her body language. The look of nervous anguish she tries to bury. Examining first her face. Then her temporary FBI badge. Sniffing her perfume through the holes in the glass partition. The only thing keeping them apart. He runs off a number of things about her personality. Capped by the surprising concern he shows when she's attacked by another cell-mate.That one scene is quite wonderful. Both Hopkins and Foster shine in this moment, arguably the best one they share. There are times when you're not sure who has the upper hand. Lecter gets under her skin. But you can tell Starling hits a nerve when she questions his choices in life. Just listen to the sharp clang the steel drawer makes when Lecter shoves a psychological profile Clarice brought back in her face. That's more jarring than his infamous Chianti speech.Although much has been made of Hopkins' admittedly impressive performance, Jodie Foster is the real star. She gives a perfectly balanced blend of tough resolve and emotional fragility. The way expressions play out over her face are easily decipherable and greatly accessible. She doesn't make any grand gestures. The pain of her troubled childhood and the growing horrors of her work are communicated in her beautifully expressive eyes. She's the heart and soul of the picture. Jodie Foster is one of my favourite actresses, and she inhabits the role of Clarice Starling so well, there comes a time when it stops being acting.You could say the same of Hopkin's quietly sinister performance. Hopkins learned not to blink his eyes for extended periods. Something he utilises to great effect. I love the scene when Lecter is probing Clarice while she's talking about the time she ran away from home. Demme has the camera right in his face. Resolved. Implacable. Unrelenting. Its a frightening scene of equal manipulation and concern on Lecter's part.The film is less successful in its supporting cast. Scott Glenn is OK as Jack Crawford, Starling's superior. But he's only designed to be there when the plot is moving along. Anthony Heald's Dr Chilton is purely one-dimensional. There's no depth to his character. And I was a bit disappointed with Ted Levine's Buffalo Bill. A transvestite making a coat from women's flesh. The film tries to craft a similar relationship between Levine and Catherine Martin, his abductee, in the same manner as Lecter and Starling. A killer and an innocent. But it doesn't work the same way. The chemistry just isn't there.One thing I liked about the book was I got the impression Dr Lecter was pulling the strings from the comforts of his jail cell. I didn't always get that same impression with the film. Not to criticise Demme's direction. He keeps things moving at a brisk pace. But still, he throws in a few hackneyed ideas here and there, e.g. anagrams with hidden clues, to keep things moving.And I'm not sure I believe Lecter's method of escape. It seems a bit ridiculous to me. And it makes fools out of real SWAT teams. The ending seems hard to believe too. I didn't buy for a second an FBI trainee would be sent into such a potentially dangerous situation, even if she thought it wasn't the home of the killer. Although it does build up to a tense, well sustained climax in the blacked out interior of Buffalo Bill's basement. Where we see through his night vision goggles, leering at a frightened and bewildered Clarice. Images of his hand reaching out for her are scary as hell, and reminds me of John Carpenter's techniques in Halloween.The Silence of the Lambs is undeniably an enjoyable effort that occasionally digs into some dark areas. But it doesn't quite do the novel justice. Excellent performances from Hopkins and Foster. Superb direction too. But its lacking that essential ingredient, brilliance, to elevate it to classic status.

Yes, I absolutely loved it but it's one of those films that makes you think (long after the credits have rolled) and when you think about it you understand it better and appreciate it more.The screenplay is tight, concise and balanced. There's been some very skillfully wonderful editing. Nothing is loud or over the top or irrelevant to the main plot. Cinematography deserves mention as the camera movements are fantastic and very effective. Lighting and sound effect deserve mention too (as its a black and white movie and must have been one of the hardest tasks to achieve, while the sound is very well balanced).'Raging Bull' tells the story of the infamous Jake La Motta (played excellently by the one and only Robert de Niro). Its classification as a boxing movie is totally erroneous because the film is just too much more for it to be labelled as such. And by giving such a label one would be ignoring it's brilliance. Yes, boxing is a part of Jake's life (it's what he does for a living) and that's how it's portrayed. It hardly had any significant resemblance to other Boxing movies like Rocky etc. The film is more about his relationship with his brother and wife, his ups and down in his professional life ie, his rise and fall to and from fame.'Raging Bull' belongs to Robert de Niro but Joe Pesci (as the brother and manager) and Cathy Moriarty (as the wife) are equally effective in their smaller roles. The relationship between the brothers was very moving and one can't help but feel bad for La Motta when he tries to reach out to his brother in one of the final scenes. Moriarty gives a very subtle performance of the tolerant wife.Even though we see La Motta as this mean hateful jerk, we see his vulnerable side and feel sympathy. Maybe that's also why his wife Vickie stood by him through all these years. It's also interesting to see that he wasn't physically abusive to his previous wife but towards Vickie he was quite violent. His brother too tries to protect him and his family (although he has his share of flaws) but in the end when La Motta's paranoia takes over things go from sour to very bad. We just see how human these characters are and at times we hate them, we like them and we feel sorry for them.Martin Scorsese deserves special mention for putting this beautiful piece of work on the glass canvas. He obviously has a very compelling way to tell the story. It is without any doubt one of his finest works and it has stood the test of time (one of the greatest achievements for a director I suppose).

Yes, this is an impossible and surreal story. So what? It's beautiful, sentimental, sad and depressing. Fluke isn't just a movie about man's best friend. It's one of the best of its kind. They don't make movies like this now. It's a touching, dramatic, deeply emotional, heartwarming and sweet movie. A magical touch has a role here too and it goes beyond the small number of special effects (which are effective).Very few movies are capable of making me teary eyed. This one, however, is powerful on that. There are many emotional scenes. I should bring a Kleenex with me whenever I watch this film.Despite the frequent use of simplicity, this movie can also count with the help of gorgeous sceneries sunsets, rivers, waterfalls, green places, mountains, snow and other things.The soundtrack is a revelation and a masterpiece. It fits in perfection soft, relaxing, emotional and beautiful piano melody. It's entirely instrumental, no vocals or singing.I've always loved this movie and I've always thought that Fluke is such a beautiful name. Plus, Comet is another beautiful name. Comet is the name of the brown Golden Retriever that portrays Fluke, while Barney is the name of the Saint Bernard-like dog that portrays Rumbo. Both of them terrific actors - especially the Retriever, very convincing and very expressive with his sad eyes and general acting. Golden Retrievers and Saint Bernards are among my favorite dog breeds. They're so beautiful and affectionate.As for the cast, we've got Nancy Travis as the pretty Carol in one of her best roles. We have Matthew Modine in a good performance as Tom, a workaholic. True, we don't see much of human Tom, but what we see is enough to realize that he was an emotionally distant workaholic. There is also Eric Stoltz (who was originally considered for the role of Marty McFly in Back to the Future), good as Jeff Newman. As the voice of Rumbo, we've got Samuel L. Jackson (not much of an actor, but his vocal performance is interesting). And finally, there is Max Pomeranc, who steals the show as Brian (the son of Tom and Carol). Max Pomeranc, besides being a cute and handsome boy, was also a brilliant actor. Too bad he didn't want to continue a career as an actor after this, his 2nd and last film.As for the characters, Rumbo is a cool quadruped chap. Fluke is so sweet and affectionate that we almost forget he was once Tom. Brian is such a loving and sweet kid, one of the nicest kids in the big screen. His love for Fluke is another close resemblance to the other doggy movies like this.As a final note and personal observation, it's sad that this movie did so poorly at the theaters and critically. It's one of those movies which were unfairly criticized... and is underrated either. One of the few things I don't like in this movie is the evil Sylvester character very sinister-looking with his demon-like face and also a vicious man. This should definitely be on Top 250.

Among them are Florence Tanner (Pamela Franklin of The Innocents), a young psychic medium; Benjamin Fischer (Roddy McDowall of The Planet Of The Apes), a psychic who previously visited the mansion; Mr. Barrett (Clive Revill), a scientist; and his wife, Ann (Gayle Hunnicutt). The four of them arrive at the house and paranormal things begin to happen almost instantly, and they become increasingly violent as Florence believes to be in contact with Emeric Belasco, the house's owner. But Hell House, as the locals like to call it, has already claimed lives in the past. And will these four be its next victims?After watching this movie, I was dumbfounded as to why I hadn't seen it before, because it's just my perfect cup of tea. Ghosts, old Victorian mansions, psychics, séances - I love stuff like this. And despite its age, this early 1970s horror film really delivers. It's a genuinely scary film that seemed to have slipped through the cracks and was never really recognized much from fans of the genre or regular film goers. The script, which was written by Richard Matheson, who was the writer of the novel that the film was based upon as well, is solid and is a well-told story. At first I thought it was another rendition of Robert Wise's The Haunting, but as the story progressed, I rid myself of that initial thought, because while the films are similar, they are also very, very different. This is nonetheless a very frightening flick, and it achieves this through its tense and eerie atmosphere rather than any extreme gore or bloodshed (although there are a few minimally bloody moments, which are hardly considered anything by today's standards, though).Atmospheric is probably one of the strongest words to describe this movie, because that it is. It's also quite claustrophobic, because while the Belasco Mansion setting is large, our characters never really do explore more than a handful of rooms. The interiors of the house are very Victorian and old-fashioned, which is perfect for this kind of haunted house story. It's dark as well, because the home's windows have been all bricked in - the only light is from the few lamps to be found and candles. But one of the scariest elements of this film is how it plays on our fears of what cannot be seen - the ghosts are presented through poltergeist activity so we never see them, and those things-that-go-bump-in-the-night scares are very effective here. The psychic sittings with Florence are also very frightening and the possession scenes with Emeric speaking through her sent a chill down my spine, as did the possessions of Ann and the sudden, unexpected flying-around of objects in the home. There are plenty more spooky moments in this film, but I won't name them all.John Hough, who later directed a personal favorite of mine, The Watcher In The Woods, directs this film, and does very well. It's filmed in a similar style to Watcher and the angles and close-ups are effective. Strong performances here from Roddy McDowall as our intelligent psychic who is trying to keep himself desensitized to the spirits to avoid trouble. Pamela Franklin is also very good as the young psychic who is in contact with Emeric and is the main key into the spirit world for the group. Clive Revill is good as the skeptic scientist, and Gayle Hunnicutt shines as his lovely wife who ends up in a few altercations with the spirits herself. I felt all of the cast had good chemistry together, and carried the movie well, especially considering our cast is only made up of essentially four people. The film's shuddering conclusion in the chapel room is a bit strange, and the revelation of the secret room and whatnot, while a little bit out there, is fitting and stands as a strange but nonetheless creepy plot revelation. It was an odd ending, but I still liked it quite a bit.Overall, The Legend Of Hell House is a superior haunted house film (with a prime focus on psychic activity) that seems to be unrecognized by horror fans. It's a very frightening movie with plenty of suspense and tension, some genuinely creepy moments, and an atmosphere to die for. I'd say this was probably one of the best, if not the best haunted house film of the 1970s decade. Also recommended is Robert Wise's classic The Haunting, which is similar in style and story.

I'd say this was probably one of the best, if not the best haunted house film of the 1970s decade. Also recommended is Robert Wise's classic The Haunting, which is similar in style and story. In fact, if paired with this movie, it would be the perfect double feature. 9\/10.

Maybe this movie absorbed me because I don't watch many thrillers and this was a change of pace, but it can get its hooks into you on several fronts.Early on two themes are set forth that are attention grabbers. One is the back-story of a secret service agent, Frank Horrigan, who was in the detail protecting President Kennedy at the time of Kennedy's assassination. We see Frank in a picture from the time of the assassination. Whenever we see such a picture it is hard not to wonder what the story is behind the people we see - how did they come to be there and what happened to them? Here we get the inside story on Frank. The second theme is that of presidential assassinations in general. That topic seems to be endlessly fascinating and the assassination of Kennedy is perhaps not even second to that of Lincoln in spawning speculation and controversy, even almost a half century on. Frank's story hooks us into Kennedy's assassination in a personal way that brings the event into focus in ways we have perhaps not thought deeply about. What if Frank had been successful in protecting Kennedy? How would things have been different? It's hard to resist being given an insight into Frank's personal involvement, even if fictional, in one of the most significant events of the 20th century.Clint Eastwood does a fine job in playing Frank as a man tortured by about as big a what if as anyone is ever likely to have to live with. One of the strengths of In the Line of Fire is that it delves fairly deeply into Frank's psychology. The main tool in exposing Frank's tortured soul is his being taunted by Mitch Leary (John Malcovitch), an eerily diabolical psycho intent on killing the president circa 1991. Malcovitch plays Leary so well, and with such creepy wickedness, that you begin to wonder what he is like in real life. Mitch has seized on tormenting Frank as a form of gamesmanship, feeling that both he and Frank have been let down by a government that they once were willing to die for. Questions are raised about the psychology of someone whose job it is to take a hit for a president, perhaps a president they don't even respect. I also liked the relationship that developed between Frank and his partner Lilly (Rene Russo). They may not be Bogart and Bacall but they have some well-written, sharp dialog that adds some spice to the movie.Then there is the aspect of going behind the scenes at the highest levels of power in the U.S. This hook is what drove the popularity of The West Wing for its seven-year run on TV and is well exploited here. We are even treated to Fred Thompson playing a duplicitous White House Chief of staff.The pacing is brisk, but the story is skillfully presented and there is never any difficulty in being able to follow what's going on.

Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones generate genuine sexual chemistry despite their age gap (Connery was just shy of 70 when the film was made), and there are a couple of suspenseful heist sequences along the way. Between the high spots the film is rather bland and forgettable, with little of the humour that made the heist movies of yesteryear such fun (try to imagine The Hot Rock or The Italian Job stripped of their sense of humour, and you'll have a fair impression of what this film has to offer).Virginia Baker (Catherine Zeta-Jones) works for a top insurance company. Also, secretly, she is a master cat burglar who greatly admires the audacity and criminal success of another thief, Robert MacDougal (Sean Connery). Virginia double bluffs her boss, Hector Cruz (Will Patton), into allowing her to track down MacDougal. Her official brief is to become his partner-in-crime for a daring heist, after which she is supposed to turn him over to the police. But in reality, Virginia actually DOES want to be his partner-in-crime.... and has no intention of turning him in whatsoever! Aided by MacDougal's buddy Thibideaux (Ving Rhames), the thieving twosome complete their robbery successfully. Later, MacDougal reveals his plans for an even bigger job. With Virginia as his accomplice, he aspires to pull off the near-impossible theft of $8 billion dollars from the world's tallest building in Kuala Lumpur on Millennium Eve. By this point, Cruz has begun to suspect that Virginia may not be working on the side of the law any more. In a taut finale, MacDougal and Virginia attempt to complete their ingenious crime before the security forces catch them red-handed.Entrapment is slick and effortlessly watchable stuff with little discernible style of its own. Connery and Zeta-Jones, as already noted, overcome their remarkable age difference to make for a rather attractive pair. A good measure of any heist flick is whether your sympathies lie with the crooks or the law. In this one, the burglars win hands-down.... they are infinitely more charismatic than the good guys. The globe-trotting narrative provides some exotic locations in which the stars can indulge in their posturing. Kuala Lumpur especially comes across as an exciting and interesting locale, somewhat underused to date in the movies. Entrapment has its share of silly moments, including a gratuitous sequence in which Zeta-Jones trains for her first robbery by writhing in a skintight cat suit through a maze of wool (strung out in such a way as to replicate the pattern of an infra-red alarm system!) Too many scenes also have Connery vanishing into mid-air to avoid capture, a trick that becomes increasingly hard to swallow and hampers the film's credibility. All in all, though, Entrapment is a harmless time-killer that keeps you moderately entertained, especially if you catch it in the right frame of mind.

Virginia double bluffs her boss, Hector Cruz (Will Patton), into allowing her to track down MacDougal. Her official brief is to become his partner-in-crime for a daring heist, after which she is supposed to turn him over to the police. But in reality, Virginia actually DOES want to be his partner-in-crime.... and has no intention of turning him in whatsoever! Aided by MacDougal's buddy Thibideaux (Ving Rhames), the thieving twosome complete their robbery successfully. Later, MacDougal reveals his plans for an even bigger job. With Virginia as his accomplice, he aspires to pull off the near-impossible theft of $8 billion dollars from the world's tallest building in Kuala Lumpur on Millennium Eve. By this point, Cruz has begun to suspect that Virginia may not be working on the side of the law any more. In a taut finale, MacDougal and Virginia attempt to complete their ingenious crime before the security forces catch them red-handed.Entrapment is slick and effortlessly watchable stuff with little discernible style of its own. Connery and Zeta-Jones, as already noted, overcome their remarkable age difference to make for a rather attractive pair. A good measure of any heist flick is whether your sympathies lie with the crooks or the law. In this one, the burglars win hands-down.... they are infinitely more charismatic than the good guys. The globe-trotting narrative provides some exotic locations in which the stars can indulge in their posturing. Kuala Lumpur especially comes across as an exciting and interesting locale, somewhat underused to date in the movies. Entrapment has its share of silly moments, including a gratuitous sequence in which Zeta-Jones trains for her first robbery by writhing in a skintight cat suit through a maze of wool (strung out in such a way as to replicate the pattern of an infra-red alarm system!) Too many scenes also have Connery vanishing into mid-air to avoid capture, a trick that becomes increasingly hard to swallow and hampers the film's credibility. All in all, though, Entrapment is a harmless time-killer that keeps you moderately entertained, especially if you catch it in the right frame of mind.

Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones generate genuine sexual chemistry despite their age gap (Connery was just shy of 70 when the film was made), and there are a couple of suspenseful heist sequences along the way.

The burning question becomes Do you live to work or work to live? Novelist Kobo Abe and director Hiroshi Teshigahara blended like milk and coffee to create this masterwork of weirdness. Similar in tone to an old Twilight Zone episode, it is handsomely shot, stunningly scored, and performed with rare conviction. It is not realistic in its depiction of the circumstances our hero finds himself in because it is more concerned with investigating the psychological consequences of his dilemma. There is a steaming erotic edge to the drama and a doomed atmosphere of resolve that enriches the conflict. It is an extraordinary work that requires viewer patience. Its rewards are many.
