How many of the producer's relatives are posting reviews on this site? This movie was the most boring thing that I ever saw in my life. They tried to make it a dark comedy, but they failed miserably. I kept waiting for it to get better and it just didn't. I couldn't even get through the entire movie and had to turn it off three quarters of the way through before I fell asleep. Trust me on this one, the positive reviews are all bogus. You will hate yourself if you try to see this movie. Worse yet, you'll loose nearly two hours of your life. Yes, this movie has name actors and a supposedly good director, but those two things do not a movie make. It just goes to prove that a good script is everything.
