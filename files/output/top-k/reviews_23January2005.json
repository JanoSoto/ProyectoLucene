I'd thought I'd seen good anime when a friend brought me 'Akira', but this one is just awesome.It has everything that one could want. An interesting plot, deep thoughts, nice dialog, hot chicks, cool action, neat tech, and animation that puts everything to shame which has ever been produced in the western world.Now when I watch anime I usually expect (and dread) the scene which will explain something about the fundamental nature of life, the universe, or whatever. This is (the only part) where 'Akira' failed. This is where 'Final Fantasy' went down the drain. But 'Ghost in the Shell' shines here brightly. While watching it for the first time I had always this nagging feeling that some such scene would turn up and ruin the truly stunning visuals. Not so. After the '2501' monologue the story really comes together and you start to be eager for story development instead of just looking for the many details and extravagant action sequences.A word on the story No, you will probably not 'get' the story the first time around. Especially in the English version you will have to make the connection between MoFA, MF, MFA and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that is easy to get confused over. The whole storyline might not be quite as complicated as understanding some 'Aeon Fluxx' episodes, but you have to rewatch the story to get a feel for the interconnection of the different players - especially if you are not familiar with the Ghost in the Shell literature. The story,thank god, is not dumbed down for the average viewer. This is what makes rewatching it so enjoyable. It has also some nice reflections on what it means to be human - things you may ask of yourself after the movie finishes ('Who knows what's inside our heads. Have you ever seen your own brain?').The animation is superb, and used to unusual effect. The details are exquisite - especially cloth effects and character motions. There are a few scenes that only have music or an accentuating sound effect in the background while the animators show off their full artistic talent. But it's not just show-off time, the visuals are tied in with the subject and leave the viewer time to reflect on the philosophical\/sociological messages (like showing the cybernetic heroine look at tailors' dummies)In short This is a must see for anybody who likes anime. Definitely a movie for grown-ups, though, because the graphic violence may disturb kids and the philosophy will go right over their heads.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 January 2005","score":"28 out of 30 people found the following review useful","review":" That anime could be this good.

Her husband Clem (Walter Pigeon) is part of the patrol in their small village, their son Vin (Richard Ney) is fresh from college and now in the Royal Air Force, after marrying Carol (Teresa Wright). Two more small children, Toby and Judy round out the Miniver family, who finds that they go from relative upper-middle class comfort to watching helplessly as their village is destroyed around them. All the while, Kay Miniver remains a bastion of strength, despite her own fears and discomfort.Mrs. Miniver became very popular during the war because it was a very realistic depiction of what civilians had to deal with in England during WWII. It is hard to imagine dealing with night raids and bombing when we have not fought a war on American soil since the 1800's, but while watching the film's frightening war scenes, I tried to imagine the courage that must have been necessary to survive. I have of course thought about these things to some extent, but it is ironic that a William Wyler melodrama was the film to really put all of it into perspective, not the big budget war films of the last sixty years. This is truly a testimony to the greatness of the film and its actors.Greer Garson is luminous and superb. She always seems to play very wise, strong women (see Pride & Prejudice). While the title of the film is Mrs. Miniver, it is centered on family, however. From the fabulous chemistry between Garson and Pigeon, (you REALLY believe that they are happily married) to the natural on-screen relationship with the children in the film (particularly the small ones), theirs is truly a delightful family. As for Mrs. Miniver herself, she is such a good person that pretty much everything around her becomes more positive with her involvement. From the beautiful rose named in her honor in the beginning of the film, to the denouement when the family home is half destroyed, Miniver is a pillar of strength, and most importantly, dignity. There are no histrionics or cheesy performances in this film, least of all by Garson.Mrs. Miniver has many ups and downs, and it certainly does not end on an uplifting note, but while it is a tear-jerker, Mrs. Miniver is so well made that its subtleties make the film even more effective. There will be a scene where a mass is being performed in a church that is almost completely destroyed in order to show that most everything in their little village has been destroyed in one way or another. The fact that this church was, in earlier scenes, a place for courting, and the place where two of the characters get married is not even pointed out. Instead of saying Look at me, this is a melodramatic and sad moment, Wyler chooses to let us come to that conclusion on our own.

I first saw it in 1992 at the theatre upon its initial release with my then-girlfriend, when I was 30 and she was 24; but this second time was in 2005 on home video, with me still in the same relationship thirteen years later and married to this same woman for ten of those; it really hit a nerve for me as a middle-aged spouse. I'm not so sure it can appeal to every viewer, but I'd wholeheartedly recommend it to older married couples everywhere.Allen's hard-hitting film dissects the long-term effects of being with the same person for a long time familiarity, infidelity, stagnation and indifference. To drive the point home still further, the photography is crudely rendered in a sometimes confusing hand-held camera style which works wonders. Woody's cast is excellent - beginning with the note-perfect Sydney Pollack and strong-willed Judy Davis, who play a bored married couple announcing a trial separation, shocking and convincing their friends (Woody and wife Mia Farrow) to take a closer look at their own vulnerable relationship. Juliette Lewis is once again a very good young actress as a twenty-year-old student in Allen's writing class who becomes infatuated with him and turns out to be his protégé. Liam Neeson is strong as the new man Davis tries to reheat her romantic life with. One of Woody Allen's best performances here too, where he's more reserved and human -- not as whiny or nerdy as we're so accustomed to seeing him. Even better, he actually makes us more interested in the other characters instead of himself.The mature story is sometimes told in a candid documentary-like format, where the participants alternately give their own perceptions as though they're spilling their guts to a psychotherapist, and then ultimately wind up expressing what they've learned from these experiences. I happen to agree with the idea that a couple must learn to accept imperfections in a marriage and work through them, together.* Released at the height of the media controversy surrounding Allen and his relationship with Mia Farrow's adopted daughter Soon-Yi, there may well have been some similarities on display here.*(EDITED UPDATE) Unfortunately, my wife and I divorced in 2010, after us being together for 21 years (married for 16 of those). I'm now in a new relationship and I suppose this experience will only serve to make HUSBANDS AND WIVES even more effective on the next viewing. **** out of **** ","genre":null},{"date":"23 January 2005","score":"56 out of 59 people found the following review useful","review":" This is one of Woody Allen's greatest films, but it took me two viewings to fully appreciate it.

A wild special effects joyride that will leave you breathless, with decently surprising plot twists and great characters (mostly).The basic story here is that the Drej, alien beings made up completely of energy, fear what humans may become if they continue to advance. So, in one great attack, they destroy the Earth at the beginning of the thirty-first century. The surviving humans are forced to fight for survival on drifter colonies, but it seems humanity is growing extinct. Then the main character, Cale Tucker, is approached by Captain Korso, who claims that he may hold the key to finding the Titan, a project that has the power to reunite the failing human race.Bill Pullman does an excellent job here voicing the tough, gritty ship captain that definitely becomes more complex then is first thought. Matt Damon too is believable in his role as main character. Drew Barrymore was sometimes a little lacking in her performances, but it was forgivable. Some of the other characters, however, were a bit over Disney-fied. The cutesy professor Guhn got a bit tiresome sometimes. On the other hand, the film was also quite violent at times. I was glad to see that they weren't afraid to kill off a few characters.However the best thing by far was the animation. Traditional drawn animation flows together seamlessly with 3D computer animation and creates some truly spectacular action scenes and a very well done cat-and-mouse sequence among a cloud of ice-crystals. The destruction of Earth was truly awe-inspiring and leaves you completely hooked from the first five minutes of the film to the action packed conclusion.Now, this is by no means an incredibly thought provoking or complex as, say, Blade Runner or 2001 Space Oddessy, but if you're looking for a great thrill ride with truly unique and memorable battles and gorgeous animation, then this film is for you.***1\/2 out of **** Other recommendations Final Fantasy The Spirits Within, Heavy Metal FAKK 2 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 January 2005","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Titan AE is still one of my favorite movies of all time.

A wild special effects joyride that will leave you breathless, with decently surprising plot twists and great characters (mostly).The basic story here is that the Drej, alien beings made up completely of energy, fear what humans may become if they continue to advance. So, in one great attack, they destroy the Earth at the beginning of the thirty-first century. The surviving humans are forced to fight for survival on drifter colonies, but it seems humanity is growing extinct. Then the main character, Cale Tucker, is approached by Captain Korso, who claims that he may hold the key to finding the Titan, a project that has the power to reunite the failing human race.Bill Pullman does an excellent job here voicing the tough, gritty ship captain that definitely becomes more complex then is first thought. Matt Damon too is believable in his role as main character. Drew Barrymore was sometimes a little lacking in her performances, but it was forgivable. Some of the other characters, however, were a bit over Disney-fied. The cutesy professor Guhn got a bit tiresome sometimes. On the other hand, the film was also quite violent at times.

The idea of a futuristic Utopian society where life ends at the age of 30, only to be renewed again sounds pretty neat. The story\/idea is excellent.Michael York and Jenny Agutter play the leads in perfect straight-to-video fashion (as can only be expected). Richard Jordan as an assassin to take out runners (ie. people who turn 30 and decide to run for their lives) adds a nice blend of evil. Farrah Fawcett turns up in a tiny role as what else, a plastic surgeon's ditzy blonde assistant! The acting is sub-par save for Sir Peter Ustinov, who could fascinate me just by reading from the phone book, adds heart and comic as an old man born and raised in the outside world.Now as for the special effects. Well, maybe back in 1976, audiences might have thought people walking around in togas and leotards with seventies hairstyles could have passed for a society living in the 23rd Century... but these days, it just looks funny. Actually, most of the ideas for special effects in this movie are not just outdated, but they actually look REALLY outdated.The exterior shots of the city look like a 70's architectural display model of a cheesy golf club. Most of the furniture look like it came directly out of a K-Tel infomercial. The interior shots of the Arcade look like something that could be found in any 70's shopping mall, from the twin escalators to the box-container elephant-ear plants. And how about the Carousel? Well, it's supposed to be some sort of an arena where the same extras sit down and do that power thing by pumping their fists in the air, cheering and clapping while a group of people who have just turned 30 get lifted off the ground via pull-strings and float towards a funky-looking chandelier as they explode in a shower of sparks and flames.Spears with glow-sticks on the ends. A talking computer with lettering font long outdated since the late 70's. Fawcett wearing a sequined green Peter Pan outfit. York's face appearing in holographic mirrors shouting dialogue in slow motion! What more could one ask for! It gets even funnier. When York and Agutter encounter Box, an evil robot that looks like a big upright vacuum cleaner with clothes dryer exhaust pipe arms and Christmas tree lights on its body, you won't be able to stop yourself from laughing uncontrollably. My sides were still hurting after watching Box chase the two characters while flailing its arms around in the air brandishing what looks to be a pilot lighter! The only really good scenes were the shots of Washington D.C. covered with creepers and vines. An apocalyptic vision of a world fallen by the stupidity of man (as always).The action scenes were actually alright. Watching two people on the run can always be fun, no matter what the setting. But watching them dodge exploding squibs that look like chintzy fire crackers as they get fired upon by angry Sandmen was pretty funny. The funniest scene was seeing Fawcett getting blown away by a cloud of smoke as a wall gets broken into. And who could forget the hilarious scene in the plastic surgeon's office where the machine goes bonkers causing someone to die from thin red lines of paint.All in all, LOGAN'S RUN is a fun movie to watch. The story is captivating. You don't need to care about the acting - all the producers did was cast a bunch of people with pretty faces and not much acting range. One can always count on Michael York for various occasions of over-acting in scenes that don't require it. But watch for the special effects. They haven't held well over time, which now make them prime and ideal targets for jokes and laughter.

The film is taut, thoughtful, well-acted and not overly long. There is equal measure of action, love scenes, and Roman political intrigue; therefore the film doesn't bog itself down in any one area or cliché as some of these epics do. This makes Spartacus a well-balanced movie that is really watchable.Great sets, great costumes and great actors compliment a brilliant script. The film is very well produced and effectively directed. The fight scenes are extremely absorbing - especially the fight-to-the-death pairings watched by Crassus (Lawrence Olivier), Glaborus (John Dall) and the Roman ladies; the love scenes are touching (first time around anyway); and the scenes of political intrigue in Rome are an excellent off-set to the plight of the gladiators.By including the political scenes, Kubrick added a tremendous depth to Spartacus. The political play-off between Crassus (an optimate), Caesar (a populare) and Gracchus (head populare) add a great historical flavour to what was going on politically in ancient Rome at the time, and help no end to take the weight off the 'fighting for freedom' motif of the film. These scenes also provide us with a great subplot involving Gracchus (Laughton) and Bataiatus (Ustinov). The research for these scenes was done well, and the script is very intelligent, incisive and sharp.The film fails in some areas though. The good versus evil motif was clearly intended as American Cold War era propaganda. Note the monologue at the start of the film which states that Spartacus was dreaming of an end to slavery forty years before the coming of Christ and 2000 years before slavery would end. The monologue infers that Christianity does not favour slavery, but freedom. This was not the case in the ancient world - bishops kept their own slaves, and Jesus Christ and St. Paul themselves do not denounce slavery, but instead use it as a metaphor for being a 'slave of god.' To the early Christians, and Jesus Christ, the social position you held in life was not important, what was important was if you had been a good person and served your master well, for it was the afterlife which counted.It was also impossible for someone in the ancient world to envisage a world without slavery. Spartacus would not have had the slavery-free world of our own, in which freedom is a right and not a privilege, to compare his own to. Slavery had always been a normal, intrinsic part of ancient society. Slaves may not have liked to be kept prisoner, but they would not have been able to comprehend a world in which such a condition did not exist. This heavy-handed aspect of the movie is an American manufacture - creating a protagonist and antagonist situation to suit the times in which the film was made.Nonetheless, this is a minor quibble that can be overcome by the merits of the rest of the movie. Spartacus is a finely crafted outing that takes the audience along in an involving and sweeping story that is well-acted, well-scripted and which takes the trouble to add a good amount of depth to its otherwise engrossing subject matter.

He says for it's written the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with her blood. And I saw her sip upon a hairy beast and she held forth a golden challis full of the filthiest fornication's and upon her forehead was written, behold I am the great Mother of #an inaudible word I couldn't make out no matter how many times I rewound the tape and tried to, sorry# and all abominations of the Earth. This opening narration means nothing at all and is just downright bizarre. After the opening credits which are set over shots of Transylvanian architecture we get an on screen caption that informs us we're in 'Los Angeles, California U.S.A. City of the Angels'. I knew I was in for a long 86 minutes. It's probably not too long after the events of the original Howling (1981) and it's Karen White's funeral. After the ceremony Karen's brother Ben (Reb Brown) is spoken to by an 'occult investigator' called Stefan Crosscoe (Christopher Lee) who says that Karen is a Werewolf and that she will come back to life. Ben dismisses such nonsense. But together with one of Karen's friends and colleagues Jenny (Annie McEnroe) he visits Stefan at his home. There Stefan tells them about Werewolves and how they can be killed, he mentions Stirba (Sybil Danning) who is the queen of Werewolves. Stefan also shows them a photograph taken at Karen's funeral of a woman named Mariana (Marsha A. Hunt) and that she is an extremely vicious and dangerous Werewolf who wants Karen. Stefan says he will stake any Werewoves through the heart with titanium. Ben figures out that Stefan means he will stake Karen as well so together with Jenny he travels to the graveyard where his sister's crypt is to stop Stefan. However lots of Werewolves turn up and attack Stefan, Ben and Jenny. They survive the attack and manage to find out that Stirba is to be found in Transylvania. They all decide to travel to Transylvania and stop Stirba and her Werewolves from taking over the Earth by fulfilling a centuries old curse. Once there they travel to a small town called Vlkava which means 'where wolves live' and meet up with the local priest, Father Florin (Ladislav Krecmer) and his small but loyal group of Werewolf hunters, hey what else can I call them? Oh, and a dwarf named Florica (Ludmila Safarova) helps too. They follow Mariana who they hope will lead them to Stirba. But Stirba knows of Stefan's arrival and has plans for him Ben and Jenny. Will Stefan be able to put an end to Stirba's plans for world domination? Will this film get any more bizarre or surreal? Watch it and find out. Directed by Philippe Mora this is one strange mess of a film. It's poorly edited as certain sequences just jump around incoherently. The single biggest problem is the script by Robert Sano and Gary Brandner based on his novel which is all over the place and doesn't make any sort of sense or introduces us to any proper characters that we like. Luckily it moves along like a rocket and is never dull or boring, unlike the original. Something strange or bizarre is always happening to keep the viewer entertained. Most people will probably hate it, but for those of us who enjoy 'bad' films this is right up there with the best of them. There are Werewolf orgies which are just freaky to watch. We get some cool Werewolf killing weaponry. The sets and locations just seem so out of place and I don't know if this was actually shot in Transylvania but it doesn't look like what I thought mid 80's Transylvania would. Stirba's castle is part dungeon, part Gothic castle and part modern luxury house. Stirba and her servant's costumes are very over-the-top, Stirba wears an outfit that looks like it belongs in a S\/M video and to be fair to her she looks pretty sexy, and her minions wear skimpy leather clothing too. The special make-up effects range from good to poor, a dwarf's eyes explode, someone has their hand ripped off and a priest has some creature emerge from his mouth but this isn't a film loaded with gore, although there are plenty of effect sequences with Werewolf transformations and attacks. There is plenty of nudity as well as Stirba and her minions are a real randy bunch of Werewolves! I should also mention the music, the soundtrack is dominated by awful rock music that I hated and I ended up turning the volume down. Acting is weak all round and what on Earth was Christopher Lee thinking about when he accepted this film?! I wonder what he thinks of it. Basically the whole thing is a real mess, but I found it a fairly entertaining mess all the same. Impossible to recommend but it kept me watching through to the end. Speaking of which the end credits run over what appears to be deleted scenes and cut footage, it also features the same shot of Sybil Danning taking her dress off and exposing her breasts probably in excess of 20 times!

Incredibly enough, despite how sky-high my expectations were for this film, I was pleasantly surprised and my expectations were definitely exceeded. As you probably already know, this whole film runs 'backwards'... meaning that you start by seeing the end, and then go all the way back to the beginning. There's a line in the film that perfectly states the immediate thought that just about anyone has about this idea when they first hear it I always thought the joy of reading a book is not knowing what happens next. A reasonable assumption, but not always a true one. Especially not when it comes to this film. Because every single scene, up to (but not including) the very last one, starts with the ending of the next one, and ends with the beginning of the previous one. This makes the mystery even more elusive and adds more intensity to the thriller portions of the film. The brilliant and unique reverse time-line is perfectly explained by the main characters condition. This is the best film I've seen in quite a while, and I can't argue with its position on the top 250(as I'm writing this, it's #20). While some might think it's just a typical mystery-thriller with a non-linear time-line thrown in, but it's so much more than that. Like another reviewer points out, it's not what you say, but how you say it. Between every scene in the backwards moving time-line, there is one in black and white that follows a normal time-line. This is great as a break from the scenes moving towards something you already know, and makes the mystery even harder to figure out. The great thing about this film is, not only do we experience the same confusion that the main character does, but we also find out the truth, which he learns at the beginning of the story, at the end of the film. With it comes some nice observations and truths, which I'll let you discover for yourself. I won't jot down the plot here; read a quick summary somewhere or just watch the film and find out about it. I might ruin the surprise for you, a crime greater than most. Everyone deserves to see this film and discover all of it for themselves. I will say, though, that it's brilliant. The pacing is excellent, you're never bored and you never lose interest. The acting is flawless. The characters are well-written and credible. Do yourself a favor; know as little about this film as possible. Don't ask anyone about it, don't read about it. Just rent it and watch it, you won't regret it. I recommend this film to anyone who can appreciate fine film-making, but I suppose fans of mysteries, thrillers and\/or dramas might enjoy it more than people who aren't interested in those genres.

So you have to remember that frame of reference when you read these comments. I saw The Black Hole when I was six years old and, of course, I loved it. Although what I remember the most about that experience was my first glimpse of Maximilian, the giant killer red robot. Maximilian terrified me. And he ended up being the first movie character to ever really scare the crap out of me.If you were 6 years old kid in 1980, you would remember this film. Because even though it's silly to make the comparison today, at one time the Black Hole held a special place in the hearts of kids everywhere, mainly because it featured a character who was even scarier than Darth Vader. That's right, Star Wars came 2 years earlier than the Black Hole, and Star Wars had a frightening guy in a black mask named Darth Vader. But let me tell you that to a kid growing up in 1980, Darth Vader was NOTHING compared to Maximilian. Darth Vader was a pansy compared to Maximilian, and I'm not just joking around. If you were a little kid in 1980, you knew about this movie. And you knew who Maximilian was. And you spoke about him in terms of reverence. Because you don't mock the robot who haunts your nightmares every single night.That's how big a deal Maximilan was at the time.Yes, The Black Hole has flaws. Yes, the rest of the robots are comical. And yes, the science fiction in the movie makes no sense. And sure, I'd agree that the sight of Ernest Borgnine in a tight turtleneck is disturbing and I never want to see it again. But none of that really matters to me. All I care about is that this movie features Maxmilian the bleeping killer red robot. And from a pop culture\/movie history perspective, that makes this movie a classic.Personally, I think that the Black Hole is a pretty lame movie. But in 1980 I would have ranked it alongside Star Wars as the coolest thing I had ever seen in my life. And of course, that is almost solely because of Maximilian. So don't make fun of this movie. Just remember that it cause a lot of nightmares in kids from the 70's and early 80's. And please give it props for featuring a villain that (at one time) was cooler and scarier than a guy named Darth Vader.So here's to you, Maximilian.Please don't Cuisinart me through a book.Mario's Movie Rating 5 out of 10 (at least it's somewhat entertaining) Mario's Maximilian Rating 10 of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 January 2005","score":"100 out of 175 people found the following review useful","review":" I saw this movie in the theater when I was 6 years old.

I really did. Someone very close to me has a mother very much like this. It's reality folks, not everyone has a sensible loving mother that grasps the role of motherhood like a duck to water. Some people remain stuck in a selfish state where they blame everyone\/thing else for all their unhappiness and the misdirection of their lives. I'm glad there's a movie that brought that subject to light. One user said the movie is celebrating an alcoholic, but that's untrue. You're watching a woman go further and further into a downward spiral of self-pitying despair and hatred for the events of her life. I also didn't find Vivi's mother to be evil, but she seemed to have been desperately trying to claim her role as a respectable wife. When your husband treats horses better than you, you get a little miffed. He dismissed her as his partner in life for a child she gave him, so the woman aimed her frustrations at her child, instead of her husband. At that time, what could she have really done to the husband? He would've beaten her most likely. I appreciated the fact that Vivi was flawed. Just humanly flawed and admitted it. It sucks that people have parents like this, but Sidda learned to deal with it in her own way. I'm glad it wasn't a typical reaction, like drugs or promiscuity. She just accepted her mother for what she is flawed and screwed up. Motherhood doesn't make you unselfish and well-versed in letting go of your troubles. That's something you learn over time, and the movie showed that. It might take 40-odd years as it did them, or someone could get it the moment the child is born. What I got from the film is that your parents had dreams and nightmares before you came into the picture, and it takes a lot out of them to come to terms with being responsible for a life that they may or may not be ready for. I also really loved the part where Sidda begins to question her ability to be a good mother and wife. I think that resonated well. I certainly would start to wonder. Parents can screw up their kids easily I tell ya. It's not a responsibility to enter into lightly.

The clones try to keep up with their assigned tasks, but slapstick panic ensues. Oh dear....The plot is not even internally sensible (forget about the logic of a middle-class man buying clones made through a doctor's office procedure), and plays like a filmed bullet-list of obligatory romantic-comedy scenes faxed over from Central Scripting. The interaction between Keaton and his clones doesn't exist It's just a bunch of Keaton-faces playing stereotypes who speak lines at each other, thanks to computer-enabled film effects.And if you're wondering (as I was) the answer is NO! The movie does not ask any interesting questions like If there were more of me, who would be the real me?...

A note on the 'vain' thing; since Brando had to step in and direct this film, and he has a lot of characters (including Rio, his own) doing stirring, piercing gazes into the camera, he was charged with vanity. So what? Hey, check out Braveheart if you have a problem with this sort of thing. It happens. You will thank your lucky stars to be looking into Brando's eyes as he method-acts his simmering fury. You will sit on the edge of a tornado of impending death.I can't comment on the fight scenes, except to say that they are particularly original and bad ass. Who knew Brando had the moves?

So what? Hey, check out Braveheart if you have a problem with this sort of thing. It happens. You will thank your lucky stars to be looking into Brando's eyes as he method-acts his simmering fury. You will sit on the edge of a tornado of impending death.I can't comment on the fight scenes, except to say that they are particularly original and bad ass. Who knew Brando had the moves? This movie was the real, real deal. You are a lucky sum-bitch to get this in your hands, and I'm out looking for the DVD for my collection now.

Even to this day, One Eyed Jacks stands against the titans of the Western Genre. I prefer it to Tombstone and Unforgiven rolled up in Silverado, True Grit and The Sons of Katie Elder. I don't hold any or all of those movies as I hold One Eyed Jacks....this movie was awesome. Coldest betrayals, Lolita-esquire dimension of sensual tension, multidimensional characters (Brando succeeded at what he feared his producers removed from the movie by cutting it down), true western atmosphere in the 1880's Sonora, San Fellipe, and Monterrey.Complaints of it being 'slow'....what the hell do you mean? It's pacing is one of it's best features! Anyone complaining of Brando mumbling needs their ears checked. This movie accomplishes more in a single scene without a shot to send your suspension of disbelief flying than any western I have ever seen.

It's one of the most beautiful stories about teenagers that had ever been written. The suicides of these five beautiful girls aren't to be taken seriously, it's a metaphor the author uses. He wants so write about the strange and often really terrible feelings teenagers have. And Sofia Coppola created an atmosphere I can't describe. Just as a light wind on a hot summer day, if you know what I mean. She's really one of the greatest young directors (especially female) of our time. Lost in Translation is a masterpiece as well. The actors were good, Kirsten Dunst is such a great actress, she should do more movies like The Virgin Suicides, where she really has to act. Josh Harnett is wonderful as Trip and the girls who play Therese, Mary, Bonnie and Cecilia, are great discoveries. If you like films with depth, films you have to think about, this one here is remarkable for you. Please, watch it and immerse in the world of the Lisbon girls and the boys next door.P.s. I hope I didn't make too much mistakes. ) ","genre":null},{"date":"23 January 2005","score":"71 out of 105 people found the following review useful","review":" I've searched for this movie more than two years, cause I've read the book and I do love it.
