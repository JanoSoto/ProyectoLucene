Yes, the film is erotic and contains some sex and nudity, it is an erotic movie. However, it is NOT meant to titillate or arouse.

The company that distributed it, if not the production company that produced it, went bankrupt, was bought out by I forget whom, then redistributed to theaters under the title The Beast. That's what happened.So, yes the only thing that really takes away from Beast is that we have our Soviet tankers speaking with American accents. Look past that and you have a war movie on par with Hamburger Hill or even Saving Private Ryan. The message that this one sends, I'll venture to say, has a lot more to say than Ryan, but let's not start with the comparisons and contrasts. (Personally, I like Ryan a whole lot, but I also think it is a tad overrated.)With Beast, you have to keep in mind the German invasion of the Soviet Union in the 1940s, specifically the siege of Stalingrad, which saw the Russians taking a victory over the undefeatable German army. This time around, the tables are reversed, and it's the Russians who are the aggressors. (Honestly, I still don't know what pretext was used for Soviet Russia to invade Afghanistan. I should read about that.) Jason Patric plays Konstantin Koverchenko, driver of the tank crew which has taken a wrong turn into a valley that has only one way in and out. Soviet ideology and his proclivity to think for himself, apparently, don't mix well, and so when he and his crew are doggedly pursued by a band of Mujahadeen, he is more and more disillusioned with the Soviet invasion.To make matters worse, his tank commander Daskal (played by George Dzundza from The Deer Hunter) is an ardent Soviet&#x97;but more so war hawk&#x97; and when a dispute over a fellow crew member, an Afghan communist patriot, ends with the murder of that crew member, whom Koverchenko endeavoured to protect from Daskal's irrational suspicion&#x97;when that happens, proverbial sh&#x97;&#x97; hits the proverbial fan. To make a long story short, Koverchenko shifts loyalty to the Mujahadeen, for whom he has sympathy and admiration.One Mujahid in particular&#x97;Taj&#x97;is played by Steven Bauer from Scarface and Traffic fame. I am not an expert on Arabic, but he seemed pretty damn convincing to me as a freedom fighter. We also have in the tank crew Stephen Baldwin in, perhaps, his best role apart from The Usual Suspects. We also have Don Harvey, who has been, and probably will always be, type-casted as the scumbag character. (If you do not know whom I speak of, he is the fellow from Creepshow 2, Casualties of War, Tank Girl, and why don't we include Die Hard 2 for extra measure? The only movie that I can think of right now where he doesn't play a scumbag is perhaps The Untouchables. You could put The Thin Red Line in there if you'd like, but it's such a small part that&#x85; well, I don't know.)In any case, what we have is a bunch of a character actors and one semi- starring actor taking on an ambitious project. The product is gold. Mark Isham's score is something of a highlight itself. Seriously, this movie is such a downer if you really think about it. (Mark Isham, by the way, also scored Crash.

BellePaige O'Hara is a daughter of a smart and funny inventor Maurice Rex Everheart. She has a love for her father and books but, she wishes for a better life. The town's most handsome man Gaston Richard White tries to get Belle's attention, but she refuses. Then one night, when Maurice tries to make a shortcut on the way to the inventor's fair, he is stopped by wolves. Maurice then finds shelter at a castle, but soon he becomes prisoner of the Beast Robby Benson. Later, when Belle finds her father in the dungeon, the Beast stops her from setting him go. But then, Belle decides to trade herself for her father's safety. Soon, Belle realizes that she is seeing magical things such as a teapot, a candlestick and a clock come to life. The magical things are really humans that have been cursed because of a spell that turned the prince into a Beast. Now the Beast must find a way to get back to his human self and Belle could be the one thing that could break the curse.Fans of the original will feel like going back to cloud 9 and the brand new generation of kids will be amazed. The animation is like so brighter and beautiful than ever. The Be Our Guest and dance sequences have never looked better. Plus, the soundtrack has a clearer new sound thanks to today's technology. Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman's songs are so tuneful and hummable that Stephen Sondheim and Cole Porter would give a run for their money. The characters' voices really deliver. Benson gives the Beast a creature that has been long suffering because of a mistake and a strong voice that would have made Clint Eastwood proud. O'Hara gives a marvelous and Streisand-like voice as Belle. Angela Lansbury is a revelation as Mrs. Potts and the late great Jerry Orbach shines as Lumiere.Beauty really shows us why we go to the movies for. It makes us laugh, cry, applaud, learn something and be wowed. It really delivers the same evidence for now in 2012 as it did in 1991. Note Before Beauty and the Beast, the characters from Disney's recent hit Tangled are back in a very funny short ,Tangled Ever After showing the wedding of Rapunzel and Flynn. It will make cartoon fans remember the old days of the Looney Tunes and Tom and Jerry. Also, stay during the end credits for a special treat.

I enjoy his character Flynn more so than any other character he's played, even more so then the dude from big lebowski ..some great nods to other sci fi greats like the original  day the earth stood still Tron is a great, feel good, loaded with 80's nostalgia.

Seriously tell me) and later on a plane Bond forces Goldfinger out the window and then the credits roll shortly afterwards.With that explanation of the plot I will say that it's better than it seems (even though it's not my favourite Bond film but it is close) and I suggest a watching for anyone who wants to see Bond in a new manner other than the other 20+ films.

But of course, Spielberg is no longer the director of the series, instead it is Joe Johnston who completely twists the original Jurassic Park movies that we once loved... and still do. With a 4 year spread between each movie, it was kind of hard to know what to expect when the newer one was released. Jurassic Park 2 was a successful hit, providing the same model as the first but with a different perspective. In this one, it seems like everything changed. The most significant difference is the effects. The dinosaurs in this one aren't remotely comparable to the first two. These dinos look almost animated, way worse than the original movies. Of course the T-Rex was well made and the raptors were created differently, the new dinosaur, the Spinasauraus, is an absolute disgrace to the trilogy. I can see what they tried to do here, but it just doesn't work at all and they really fell short in terms of effects. The acting also takes a weird twist, incorporating actors that we've never seen before. Sam Neill returns as main character and does his job well, but everyone else was just too new and too inexperienced to be able to insert into a series like this. They tried making something totally new out of an established series. The adventure part is probably the only decent upkeep about this movie. It is a lot shorter than the two other films, and spends a lot less time talking about nonsense. But instead, you've got the main plot of the movie which is now find our son, which is a radical turn of events from the two others, which had a climactic, theatrical storyline. Also the actors spend a lot of time finding that the fact that they are stranded on an island, is a joke almost. The movie lost it's edge theatrically, it is a lot less stressful but I do admit that some sequences are pretty well thought out. I thought that the best part about this movie was the pterodactyl scene, which is very different than anything we've seen so far. However, the movie does not live up to the main series' expectations. It is definitely the trilogy's downfall, and cannot be compared to the first two. If I had to suggest this to someone, I would say if you're a die hard Jurassic Park fan... get this film. It is a solid addition to the series and you will most likely watch it once every year or two. But if you are a mediocre fan, I suggest you to simply rent this. It had way too much wasted potential and nobody should base this series off of this film.

Every part of this movie adds up to something so much greater than the sum of its parts. Ultimately, I suppose the credit goes to the director, William Wyler, though in 1936 I'm not sure he would have had the same kind of control a director can have now with casting a movie, deciding on a screenwriter, crew, and that sort of thing. But it all comes together for something so perfectly conceived, that I can't really just mention the story, or the performances by Walter Huston and Ruth Chatterton; the writing, the cinematography, or set design.A description of the movie or even the type of film or genre it's in wouldn't do it justice in the way that I could at least describe some of my other favorite movies. It does everything right-it's so sophisticated, sensitive, mature, in dealing with the marriage of a middle aged couple going on their first vacation in twenty years together.Minor spoiler-it deals with so much, but if you were to describe the story, it's about how Dodsworth (Walter Huston) and his wife, Fran (Ruth Chatterton) leave America and really try to enjoy themselves and each other for once. But Fran is insecure about her age and her older husband, and this insecurity begins to push her away from him and towards, well, not necessarily even other men, but away from anyone.And yet, that doesn't come close to describing what this movie is really like or what it's about. It's every moment that's played so sensitively. It's got lots of emotion, but it's not sentimental. It's got a ruthless efficiency in building each scene upon the last, clearly giving each character different motivations and showing how their relationships change.I haven't seen this movie show up in many discussions or top lists, but it doesn't matter. It doesn't affect anything about the movie, whether it's under seen or under respected. TCM showed it one evening as one of their Essentials, which gave me some exposure to it. Then I read David Mamet's book, Bambi vs. Godzilla, which keeps referring to Dodsworth. In it, he says that it's one of a few perfect movies. So I finally bought the DVD and watched it in earnest, and it was a singular experience.For all the words like mature and sensitive or grown up that get used to describe it because of just how realistically it shows the dynamic of a marriage that is unraveling, those don't really describe what the movie is about. Yes, it is all of those things, and it is refreshingly realistic and attentive to the details of the relationships in it. More than most movies, and perhaps surprisingly so for any movie of its period. Or today.Dodsworth is more than those things because it's like an event that transcends movies. This isn't really even a review. I just feel like someone has to add, for anyone curious, what an incredible experience this is. It's a jewel of a movie.

A movie like this is subversive to me, and that may be peculiar because of how much I love movies and want to make them, but I feel like it's an alternative to a life of working a regular or corporate job and having what I would (though I'm overstating it for lack of better words) call a mundane life.Movies in general, and especially singular movies like Dodsworth, are like secrets to me of how incredible a single experience can be. I have been thinking about it constantly since I saw it, and whenever I see a movie that even approaches it's greatness, my mood is lifted, my problems seem to go away, and a movie like this can seem like all I need or care about, because it's like an experience in another dimension.

He strips away all of the charm and wit of his normal routine and instead brings an intimate look into relationships with such a bite it would put Carnal Knowledge to shame. The writing is on top form here, the authenticity and brutally honest approach is outstanding from start to end.What's even more impressive than the writing though is the way that Allen shot it. With a lot of hand-held camera work and seemingly no set blocking for the actors, he gives it this intimate feeling that I can't think of a time I've seen utilized as well before. With the authenticity from the writers and actors, combined with that brazenly unique shooting style, it truly felt as though you were in the room with these characters, the likes I've never seen before. You are just a fly on the wall watching these interactions and it runs you through the gambit of heartache. Watching these people fall apart within themselves and away from each other, I just wanted to grab them and tell them what to do (and it felt like I could).These characters are so fully fleshed by Allen, so humanly flawed and real. All four main characters shine from moment to moment, with Mia Farrow's cerebral quality, Judy Davis' commanding presence, Sydney Pollack's dark bite and Allen's own insecurities. I think a few of the scenes went on a little too long and I wish that it hadn't taken place during that weird early '90s phase where people kept trying to make Juliette Lewis happen, but it's a tremendous work that is one of the most startlingly real looks at relationships I've ever seen.

That seemed to be the guiding strategy behind the movie as well.Writer-director Steven Zaillian takes an unfilmable subject (chess), bases it on a book few read, names it after a guy nobody had seen in 20 years, and puts it all in the lap of an eight-year-old actor who never starred in a film before and would star in only one after. Searching For Bobby Fischer does all it can to stack the board against itself, yet succeeds quite well despite, and indeed, because of all that.Joshua Waitzkin (Max Pomeranc) is celebrating his seventh birthday in Washington Square Park when he catches sight of some rough-looking characters moving what look like his Lego figures on tables of black-and-white squares. Chess is a game few master, yet Josh learns it just from watching them. Soon he is amazing parents and wizened grandmasters alike with his skill at the game, but is Josh really a prodigy on the scale of Bobby Fischer, the New York youngster who went on to win the world championship - then disappear?Searching For Bobby Fischer is a fairly formulaic film in many ways. It presents us with stock situations like an adorable boy who only wants to be good; a father (Joe Mantegna) who is too concerned with winning; a mother (Joan Allen) afraid her son is being turned into a machine; and a streetwise black man (Laurence Fishburne) who sees things in the child before anyone else. There's even a villain who appears shrouded in darkness, and who glares at Josh so menacingly its easy to forget this dark figure isn't quite four feet tall.But the formula really works in this one, in part because it serves such a strange cause (how many other chess movies can you think of?) and mostly because of Pomeranc's unaffected work in the lead role. Pomeranc seems preternaturally aware of his fragility on camera and plays to it in ways that reflect not precociousness but depth. You just feel for the guy, exult with his triumphs and feel his disappointments so much you resent Mantegna when his character rides Josh about doing better.Pomeranc also does great ensemble work with the other characters, especially Ben Kingsley as Josh's instructor Bruce, a fellow who seems to have been somebody's idea of Josh a generation ago only for it to collapse on him. Bruce doesn't want Josh to show mercy, you sense because he blames his own softness for his post-child ruination.Bobby Fischer held the world in contempt, he tells Josh.I'm not him, Josh replies. That's the whole movie right there.Searching For Bobby Fischer feels incomplete in parts. Maybe it's just zen-like in its comfort with koan-like plot holes. We never get a real chance to see Josh learning much with Vinnie, the Fishburne character, in a way that would better explain their later closeness. Mantagna's transformation into hard-driving parent (he has a funny but nasty scene with a teacher played by Laura Linney, one of many future talents on display here) isn't laid out convincingly. But thanks both to Zaillian's affecting script and superlative camera work by the incomparable Conrad Hall working close to his zenith, you sense many things lying just beneath the surface of your view, there to be pondered when the rush of the film dissipates.And what a rush! Josh learns that winning isn't everything, but he also comes to care enough to give it his best shot in a climax both thrilling and heartwarming, even if it plays a bit to conventions. Searching For Bobby Fischer suggests something redemptive and perhaps even romantic in a game it dares to compare to art.

River's Edge pretty much covers such topic except that instead of kids we have a bunch of teenagers (and some kids too) getting involved in a complicated situation. One of them killed a girl and for whatever reasons he decided to share this with his friends who don't know how to respond to such problem.

Dramatic and thrilling enough to make you care about it River's Edge is a good film while dealing about the teen angst and how they try to cope with adulthood and its problems (here, throughout this crime they'll learn the value of friendship and also some moralistic lessons). The greatest thing covered here was the lack of communication between the teens in certain moments, when they couldn't express what they were feeling about everything happening to them, that was incredibly real, this anxiety of wanting to say and show something but not being able to do it. Other good point that must be raised is their immaturity, also very credible. They're dumb characters but not dumb enough to let you hating them like some flicks tend to do; you'll understand their idiotic moves and actions as being completely natural to them who are more interested in getting stoned and causing trouble then realizing the consequences for their acts. Sadly, this could be an great movie if wasn't for the creative flights of imagination from its writer and director who put unnecessary and unrealistic things in a story that sounds so real, so credible. Examples the kids reaction when they see the body for the first time. I mean, do people wouldn't freak out a bit in seeing a friend that was killed by another friend?; the teacher's lousy reaction asking his students how they felt about the girl's murder, that was over-the-top and fake; the whole segment involving Keanu's little brother wanting to get revenge on him because he was beaten by him was very unbelievable, however it's interestingly presented, it's a good thing.What could make this movie better than it is would be erase Matt and Clarissa's date night when the whole disaster wasn't solved, that was distractive (and Keanu's face while getting laid. What was that?). Instead of these expendable tender moments the film should be longer and present more about the character's past, develop them in order so we could know how they were as friends, this sense of company, if they were so close to each other or if their friendship was always moved by some interest. The acting in this film is quite difficult to be analyzed, the result will vary depending of the viewer. I enjoyed the at times over-the-top performance of Crispin Glover, other people say he ruined the film. He's very good in playing this twisted junkie who wants to help his friend, trying to be the lead of the gang. Keanu is quite bad in this, emotionless. Having his role being played by Johnny Depp, even at that time when he wasn't all that famous, and we would have a different and good performance.

Now, picture this scenario what if one of the kids was involved in a murder and keep bragging to everybody about his act showing a corpse as a way to prove that he killed someone? River's Edge pretty much covers such topic except that instead of kids we have a bunch of teenagers (and some kids too) getting involved in a complicated situation. One of them killed a girl and for whatever reasons he decided to share this with his friends who don't know how to respond to such problem. A part of the group who saw the body wants to protect their killer friend (Daniel Roebuck) like his buddy Layne (Crispin Glover), while others more doubtful of the whole thing like Matt (Keanu Reeves) and Clarissa (Ione Skye) want to do the right thing and let this being handled by the cops. It's only the beginning of a snowball effect that will become an avalanche sooner or later when other people get stuck with them in this case such a dangerous lunatic (Dennis Hooper), Matt's younger brother and plenty of others. Dramatic and thrilling enough to make you care about it River's Edge is a good film while dealing about the teen angst and how they try to cope with adulthood and its problems (here, throughout this crime they'll learn the value of friendship and also some moralistic lessons). The greatest thing covered here was the lack of communication between the teens in certain moments, when they couldn't express what they were feeling about everything happening to them, that was incredibly real, this anxiety of wanting to say and show something but not being able to do it. Other good point that must be raised is their immaturity, also very credible. They're dumb characters but not dumb enough to let you hating them like some flicks tend to do; you'll understand their idiotic moves and actions as being completely natural to them who are more interested in getting stoned and causing trouble then realizing the consequences for their acts. Sadly, this could be an great movie if wasn't for the creative flights of imagination from its writer and director who put unnecessary and unrealistic things in a story that sounds so real, so credible. Examples the kids reaction when they see the body for the first time. I mean, do people wouldn't freak out a bit in seeing a friend that was killed by another friend?; the teacher's lousy reaction asking his students how they felt about the girl's murder, that was over-the-top and fake; the whole segment involving Keanu's little brother wanting to get revenge on him because he was beaten by him was very unbelievable, however it's interestingly presented, it's a good thing.What could make this movie better than it is would be erase Matt and Clarissa's date night when the whole disaster wasn't solved, that was distractive (and Keanu's face while getting laid. What was that?). Instead of these expendable tender moments the film should be longer and present more about the character's past, develop them in order so we could know how they were as friends, this sense of company, if they were so close to each other or if their friendship was always moved by some interest. The acting in this film is quite difficult to be analyzed, the result will vary depending of the viewer. I enjoyed the at times over-the-top performance of Crispin Glover, other people say he ruined the film.
