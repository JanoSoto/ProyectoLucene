[{"date":"19 December 2006","score":"","review":" As a veteran of heist movies, I think my opinion is valid when I say that it's not so much a spoof of heist films like Rififi as it is just a funny movie about thieves who bumble their way through what could be a much slicker and less complicated heist if the thieves from Rififi were pulling it off instead. The movie enjoys its fair share of little con tricks and bait-and-switch-oriented goings-on, mostly played for laughs of surprise. Perhaps Big Deal On Madonna Street is a little too laid back to really be as memorable as I was thinking it would be, but it is very funny. It has several great sight gags and well-timed moments of Italian-faced goofiness.The most entertaining thing about the film is the fact that it's Italian. The Italian cast is so jampacked with overt stereotypes, everyone gesturing wildly and saying, Mamma Mia! The outcome of the heist is such a ridiculous slur on the comic strip archetype of Italians, something twice or thrice as hilarious to an American audience. However, the appeal is not just in the humor in what is either an Italian self-parody or an unaware display of every mocked Italian institution. It's also the extroverted, old-fashioned world of your average Italian in this film. The first half hour of the film is a bunch of characters scrambling to find a friend who will take the rep for someone for a little while in prison, and everything continually gets more complicated and more tangled, and so many different people end up in prison. Not only do I find it amusing how nonchalant everyone is in deciding whether they will do this favor that involves spending time in jail or not, but I'm also fascinated about the idea that in Italy, crooks aren't so much worried about what will happen to them when they go to prison as they're worried to death of what their mother will think of them or how their mother will be so wounded by what has come of her son. It's almost a beautiful mindset, if you ask me.Big Deal On Madonna Street is no masterpiece, no movie that you desperately want to come back to, but it's very funny and an enjoyable piece of European cinema.

Tavington is based on Bannister Tarleton, a ruthless British Colonel Cornwallis appreciated having in his army, even though he found him arrogant and self-centered. The Mel Gibson character is more of symbolic figure of the typical militia patriot found in the Carolinas, the majority of whom did not want to get involved. Of course, the film could have adhered closer to the actual time-line and battle sequences and had an even more dramatic effect. The final battle in the movie is the Battle of Cowpens, which did not take place until January 1781. It was not fought in a large open field as depicted in the movie and was won because of the ground chosen for the battle and the strategy used by General Daniel Morgan. The Colonials under the command of General Horatio Gates suffered a horrendous defeat at Camden. Gates was relieved of command and replaced with General Nathaniel Green, Washington's most trusted General. General Green was considered the Command-n-Chief of the southern army. General Green placed General Daniel Morgan in charge of the Colonial Army and militia that faced a British force of 1,000 men under the command of Colonel Tarleton. General Cornwallis was not at the Battle of Cowpens. It was General Morgan that came up with the strategy of the militia firing two shots into the British line and then retreating back behind the Colonial line. Daniel Morgan chose the battle spot because of its terrain and the natural borders of a river and swamp, which were used to trap the British. Utilizing the militia, Colonial Regulars, and the light calvary under William Washington, Morgan struck a heavy blow to Tarleton's men. Tarleton escaped Cowpens and was actually at Yorktown with Cornwallis. He later returned to England and reached the rank of General in the British army and had a seat in Parliament. Morgan resigned soon after Cowpens because of health reasons. It has been widely accepted by many historians that if Cornwallis had been the Commanding General of the entire British Army in America, we would have been defeated early on, but because of William Howe's arrogance and unwillingness to pursue Washington after each victory and later, because of Henry Clinton's insistence on staying put in New York and paranoia and fear of losing his command to Cornwallis, Washington was able to escape after several defeats, benefit from an alliance with France, and prolong a war that should have ended before 1780. The British's defeat at Cowpens led to the forced march of Cornwallis' troops to Virginia as he chased Green's army out of the Carolinas. With the arrival of the French Fleet at Yorktown and Washington's siege, Cornwallis surrendered.The French Officer was another symbolic figure as many French Officers fought for the Colonials, most for glory and acclaim, but others because they believed in America's cause. Read about The Marquis De Lafayette.This movie is mostly fluff with predictable Hollywood fare. I'm reminded of an earlier film about a Scottish Patriot family member killed by a British Aristocrat, man seeks revenge in the guise of fighting for a cause, man wins battle, only this time he isn't beheaded and quartered. If you want know the actual historical events that took place in South Carolina, visit Kings Mountain Battlefield and Cowpens Battlefield. They are both worth the time, unlike this movie.

I remember when I was about 4 or 5 when it came out on video, my Godmother bought it for me for my birthday and I absolutely loved it! But it made me so sad. so when I was about 7, after watching it well over about 100 times, I banned myself from watching it, because it made me so sad and I never wanted to feel such a sadness ever again, so I put it at the back of my cupboard and forgot about it. Then today when I was going through all my old stuff I found the video and decided to watch it, and as you may have guessed, the waterworks came rushing back! This is such an honest but beautiful movie which really touched my heart. My favorite part is when Sara tells of all her stories, I feel like I am one of those little girls, and I am there, totally wrapped in just the sound of her voice. Every time I hear Saras' papa call her a princess, I get a light shiver down my spine, how they can be so close when they are so far apart, and show all that emotion on screen is incredible, and in the end when she's calling out Papa!

And this novel was written in 1945, the year in which World War II was over, millions of people have perished at the hands of Nazis, Fascists and Soviets Governements. The Roman Church has done nothing to save millions of life during this days. So we can read this novel as a strong criticism to ever desire of Man trying to reach GOD by fascist or communist rulers.

Some films have glamorised or justified it, some have been an exercise in propaganda, others have been strong anti-war statements and some have just told a story with all the facts. As a genre the same tales have been told over and over, yet what has made seeing the same story different is the fact that you're usually seeing the film through a perspective of the events.The story of The Deer Hunter is a straightforward one that revolves around a group of close-knitted friends living together in an industrial town. You'll be revealed people's love, secrets, desires and frustrations with life, all this helps to characterise the film. The story shows the life cycle of the years before and after Vietnam, ultimately showing the psychological affects of the war through cold drama.The Deer Hunter is a film that for the first seventy-five minutes builds up the dramatic experience, it's a cinematic device used to help you understand the characters and their lives. In some way it's a trick because it makes you like (and for some dislike) the characters before they're plunged into the living hell of Vietnam causing extreme devastation to their lives forever. Even though the first part of the film has been deceived as slow or laborious, I consider it a highly important aspect of the film as it helps us understand the natural reality of the character's lives before they're plunged into the war-zone. At closer look you'll notice that during this first half of the film there is a somewhat premonition of the future events that will unfold.

The film rarely moves away from its foggy and overcast weather helping to set the polluted mood the film embraces. The clean-cut editing is very smooth and polished to the finest grain. The score is musical perfection and that recognised and hauntingly striking guitar work is admirable.The acting is magnificent and you'll surely notice performances develop. Character's emotions and features become beautifully apparent as the film gradually moves along. Robert De Niro gives a career defining performance that has been unmatched in the emotional power and the philosophical subtext his character claims. John Savage gives a shy and overpowering performance bursting with intensity and with heart-wrenching accuracy of a human reaction. Christopher Walken gives the film's defining performance and the greatest touch, he's a character you will be instantly be fond of for his great sense of human and likable personality. And finally you have that riveting and disheartening performance from Meryl Streep.Michael Cimino, famous for being a one-hit-wonder of cinema never managed to regain the level of exquisite direction The Deer Hunter holds and after all the critical acclaim The Deer Hunter has been given over the years he never managed to live up to hype that was expected after the film. Thankfully Michael Cimino managed to create one of the most important samples of American cinema that deserves all recognition and the must-see acclaim it has gathered.To truly appreciate a film like The Deer Hunter it needs repeat viewings as you'll find new messages, meaning, morals and observations. Without a doubt a life-affirming piece of cinema that captures the singular beauty of the innocence in the average man and how it can be taken away through the atrocities of what adds up to meaningless violence.

It's his sixtieth birthday and a display of happy unity of the clan is in order. The extended family arrive from far and wide to settle in for a residential banquet. Including Christian - who nobody actually invited, and not his sister, who happens to be dead.From the icy charm of the bourgeoisie to the loving arms of the chambermaid, Celebration (Festen) lures us into a comfort zone with the trivia of various family members as we get to know them. Little do we realise that there is a speech coming at the formal dinner that will shock and splinter, producing a night of heart-break as family skeletons are dredged up with shattering effect. Like a macabre travesty, the horrors that are revealed are stifled beneath the stiff upper lip of black tie and bravado, until the only celebration is one of confronting truth.Director Thomas Vinterberg achieves remarkable results within the strict remit of the rather arbitrary 'Dogme95' rules of minimalist film-making. Everything is shot with a domestic video camera in low light or candlelight - looking rather like a home movie about a family gathering. Given the rather bland nature of the first half - both visually and with a story that comprises little more than day-to-day emotional ups and downs - there is a temptation to switch off and dismiss Celebration as a pretentious failure. Unfortunately for viewers who simply want to be entertained, there is very little to see. But for serious minded audiences it is well worth the wait for it for it all to kick off. The main course is a surprise, as one character so aptly points out.Head of the table Helge is given the choice of two alternative speeches from one of his offspring - the green or the yellow. It has all the innocence of family charades. And then the bottom falls out. Nastily, disturbingly, sickeningly - and so on. And it doesn't stop. After first revelation, it's a dizzying descent through moral quagmires as people try to keep the party going. But it is so realistic that we feel the pain of family members - even as they try to hide behind the façade of formal dress.A slightly theatrical touch is the staff taking all the car keys so no-one can leave. Together with the documentary-like feel of the movie, it creates an almost unbearable claustrophobia. Feel what it means to spit in your family's face! snaps Helge to his recalcitrant progeny. We do.Many filmmakers have done little with the realism that Dogme95 can evoke but Vinterberg uses it to full effect. We are so convinced of the ordinariness of everything that the plot developments, as they pile up, trap us into empathising with characters that are in a profoundly uncomfortable position.

Its simplicity and emotional force reminds me of the famous stage-to-screen melodrama, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"19 December 2006","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" It is not the most realistic criminal romp ever carved out, but there is an underlying and even fundamental sincerity in its gallery of supporting characters and in the fumbling folksiness with which they interact in the chilly north of Minnesota. 'Fargo' is the reason Roger Ebert loves movies so much. Although I do not share his same gushing love for the film &#150; or indeed, for the Coens &#150; 'Fargo' is so well-written, well-acted, well-executed and well-condensed that I find no tangible reason for why I should not feel this way about it.The title 'Fargo', much like its story, is misplaced. It briefly opens in Fargo, North Dakota but soon plunges into the barren, frigid smalltown of Brainerd in Minnesota, capturing the chill atmosphere of the setting with effortless conviction, probably because the Coens grew up in these North woods. Here Joel Coen directs and Ethan produces, but with deft, personal pen strokes by the both of them. They apply the same meticulous familiarity to their characters with Frances McDormand and William H. Macy in the front row, two smalltown people so heartwrenchingly sincere they completely carry the film.William H. Macy is a push-over car-salesman with financial difficulties who resorts to hiring two sleazeball, violent but fumbling criminals to kidnap his wife to blackmail his domineering father-in-law.

In the year 2000 they have Jason all tied up so scientists can examine him, to figure out why this dude simply can't die (they tried gassing him, electrocuting him, hell, even hanging him but nothing seems to work) but Jason escapes and kills five of the six right off. He chases one girl into a freezer room, where she tricks him and locks him in. But alas, he drives his machete right through the wall and into our hero who's name I cannot even remember and personally don't care. This sets off some alarm, and the room which contains the freezer room shuts down, and they both freeze.In 2455, a group of scientists discover the frozen bodies and they take them back to the ship. They find out they can resurrect the girl, but not Jason. They bring the girl back to life, and update her on the last 455 years (basically the earth was destroyed so humans inhabited another planet, or something like that) But they accidentally bring Jason back to life and he goes on a pointless killing rampage, with no original deaths. In fact, the only difference in this movie than to any of other Friday 13th movie is that they're on a space ship. They only thing that even made me smile slightly is a scene when a soldier backs up onto one of the spaceship walls, and Jason stabs him through the stomach, impaling him in the wall.

Zombies weren't flesh eating monsters, they're were slaves that were controlled by a master, as showed in classic zombie movies such as White Zombie and I Walked with a Zombie. George A. Romero completely threw this existing genre elements overboard and almost completely reinvented the genre. Sometimes I miss the old zombie flicks but George A. Romero introduced us to a totally new and great world of horror movies, that influenced many later movies. Copied a lot, never surpassed.Perhaps the best thing about the movie is that its low-budget but that this mostly doesn't show on screen. With creepy zombies and simple locations, George A. Romero creates a creepy, as well as realistic (and maybe because of that creepy) atmosphere. The movie could had easily gone over-the-top and became a real campy one. Considering the resources they had, they did an extremely good job with this movie. The movie is shot in atmospheric black & white. Perhaps this was done to tone down the graphic moments of the movie? Or just because it was the cheapest thing to do? But whatever the reason is, it works well for the movie and its atmosphere and it reminded me of some old '30\/'40's atmospheric horror classics. George A. Romero definitely knew his classics.The story is kept very simple and chooses not to really explain anything. It focuses on just a few characters and mostly chooses not to show anything else that is happening to the world at the moment. It makes you feel close to the characters and their fears. It's one of the reasons why Night of the Living Dead works well as a creepy horror movie, although it nowhere ever gets really scary or real tense. The movie is mostly predictable, which is also due to the formulaic, stereotypical horror-characters that we're all accustomed to but in the '60's still were quite renewing and became later genre-defining. Still the movie is a bit too amateur like for my taste at times. The directing and editing is really off at times and the acting is just plain bad. The two main character played by Duane Jones and Judith O'Dea pull off quite alright but everyone else is terribly overacting and clearly has no talent for the movie business. It was like watching an Ed Wood movie at times but luckily the moments and atmosphere of the movie compensated for this.As for the gore and graphic moments, it's was pretty shocking for '60's standards and so was the fitting ending but of course in todays perspective it's all rather toned down, also especially when you compare it to George A. Romero's later movies, such as the direct sequel Dawn of the Dead.Not as good and entertaining as Dawn of the Dead but considering the resources and the enormous influence this movie had on later genre movies, this movie remains a classic horror must-see!8\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"19 December 2006","score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" It's amazing how one low-budget flick influenced and redefined an entire genre.Before Night of the Living Dead, zombie movies were mostly movies that relied on its atmosphere and not necessarily its horror or gore and were mostly set at exotic, far off, locations.

It focuses on just a few characters and mostly chooses not to show anything else that is happening to the world at the moment. It makes you feel close to the characters and their fears. It's one of the reasons why Night of the Living Dead works well as a creepy horror movie, although it nowhere ever gets really scary or real tense. The movie is mostly predictable, which is also due to the formulaic, stereotypical horror-characters that we're all accustomed to but in the '60's still were quite renewing and became later genre-defining. Still the movie is a bit too amateur like for my taste at times. The directing and editing is really off at times and the acting is just plain bad. The two main character played by Duane Jones and Judith O'Dea pull off quite alright but everyone else is terribly overacting and clearly has no talent for the movie business. It was like watching an Ed Wood movie at times but luckily the moments and atmosphere of the movie compensated for this.As for the gore and graphic moments, it's was pretty shocking for '60's standards and so was the fitting ending but of course in todays perspective it's all rather toned down, also especially when you compare it to George A.
