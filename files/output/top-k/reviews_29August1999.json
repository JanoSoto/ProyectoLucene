It remains unobtainable here in Britain though I've heard strong rumours that a re-release is imminent. I ordered the video from Amazon.com after having traded in my VCR for a model compatible with NTSC format tapes as well as PAL (the standard format here in the UK.) Was it worth it? Sadly no.I'm afraid I have to agree with Roger Ebert (for probably the first time ever) when he describes ACO as ...an ideological mess...a paranoid right-wing fantasy masquerading as an Orwellian warning...Kubrick kicks Burgess's intentions into touch early on and turns the entire film into a vindication of Alex. All authority figures are portrayed as obnoxious, faceless caricatures. Without exception, each of Alex's 'victims' are more 'unpleasant' than they are in the book, presumably in an attempt to justify their treatment the cat-lady is changed from a frail  old lady into a rich-bitch yoga freak; Alex's brutal rape of two 10-year girls is turned into a high-speed orgy with two willing teenage participants. The misogyny rampant throughout the film is especially shocking; Kubrick's obsession with displaying nubile, large-bosomed girls in various forms of undress would appear to suggest that his key influences were not, as previously thought,  Max Ophuls and Sergei Eisenstein, but rather Russ Meyer and Benny Hill. Leaving aside its dubious morality, I would agree that there is much to admire in the film. Malcolm McDowell gives a dynamic performance (despite being 10 years too old for the role) and should have got the Oscar. The camera-work and use of music is as good as anything that Kubrick has ever done. However, I have tried and, so far, failed to fathom why this film is as highly regarded as it is. Most of its most ardent admirers do however appear to be young males. Why should this be? Perhaps, rather like the men who claim to buy Playboy magazine for the John Updike short story, it allows them an opportunity to revel in sex and violence with the comforting pretence that they're viewing 'a social satire by a major film-maker.'

The story is mind-blowing and discusses a lot of essential questions about reality, everyday life, who each one of us is and who decided it that way.The protagonist, Thomas Andersen, not really satisfied with his existence as an average employee, finally gets the contact he had always been seeking. A group of &#130;matrix-resistant&#145; individuals share their knowledge about the &#130;matrix&#145; with him and furthermore tell him that he was chosen to put an end to that fake reality and free humankind from slavery by the machines. The exposition of the story and the characters is great. The film starts within the very first second but still leaves the viewer unsure about what &#130;really&#145; is going on. Is Thomas A. Anderson only dreaming? Or is he really &#130;Neo&#145;? Is &#130;Neo&#145; more than just a night-life name? Is &#130;Neo&#145; Thomas A. Andersons true identity? The way the story unfolds is thrilling and the turning points come with good timing. One of two weak points in the story comes when the writers-directors must get Neo to confront his antagonist. Trinity at that point has to play the poor part of bringing on the delay. The way we got to know her throughout the film makes it anything but convincing that she would start long talks at that rather delicate moment.  Whoever wants to criticize Keanu Reeves for his acting probably has a problem with actors that don't show that they are acting while they are acting. He's not in flirtation with the audience or the critics while he's performing. He's too busy doing a great and extremely convincing job. I have never been a fan or something so please consider me as neutral. Lawrence Fishburne is the most charismatic Morpheus I could ever imagine, and the rest of the cast is the perfect choice also. Carrie-Anne Moss handles the extremes between the cool &#130;matrix-trinity&#145; and the sensitive &#130;reality-trinity&#145; impressively well.

Every answer is followed by a question, and &#130;the one&#145; in the end only becomes &#130;the one&#145; because he chose himself to become &#130;the one&#145;. Nothing more, nothing less. While the matrix is all clean and colorful, reality is dirty and cold. The parts of the dialogue who deal with essential questions (like &#132;what is the matrix`) are brilliantly written. (There's just that other  thing that irritates me when Morpheus tells Neo about how the machines got the power over humankind, he says humans darkened the sky so that the machines would stop working while the humans themselves  depended on the machines &#150;and therefore caused their own misery.  I always raise my left eyebrow when I see this part of the movie. Wouldn't it make more sense to say the irony comes from the fact that humans depend on the  sunlight and that way caused their own misery by darkening the sky? That analogy would work well with a lot of short-sighted actions humans have come up with over the centuries.) It's surprising to see subjects like this being discussed in a &#130;mainstream&#145; hollywood movie &#150;especially at that length.

The exposition of the story and the characters is great. The film starts within the very first second but still leaves the viewer unsure about what &#130;really&#145; is going on. Is Thomas A. Anderson only dreaming? Or is he really &#130;Neo&#145;? Is &#130;Neo&#145; more than just a night-life name? Is &#130;Neo&#145; Thomas A. Andersons true identity? The way the story unfolds is thrilling and the turning points come with good timing. One of two weak points in the story comes when the writers-directors must get Neo to confront his antagonist. Trinity at that point has to play the poor part of bringing on the delay. The way we got to know her throughout the film makes it anything but convincing that she would start long talks at that rather delicate moment.  Whoever wants to criticize Keanu Reeves for his acting probably has a problem with actors that don't show that they are acting while they are acting. He's not in flirtation with the audience or the critics while he's performing. He's too busy doing a great and extremely convincing job. I have never been a fan or something so please consider me as neutral. Lawrence Fishburne is the most charismatic Morpheus I could ever imagine, and the rest of the cast is the perfect choice also. Carrie-Anne Moss handles the extremes between the cool &#130;matrix-trinity&#145; and the sensitive &#130;reality-trinity&#145; impressively well. Stock music rarely works in movies but when Rage Against The Machine hit it after Neo flies away in the end, something just works.  The Wachowski Brothers got me. I want to see their next movie. Right now.I don't see &#130;The Matrix&#145; as bringing on  easy answers. Every answer is followed by a question, and &#130;the one&#145; in the end only becomes &#130;the one&#145; because he chose himself to become &#130;the one&#145;. Nothing more, nothing less. While the matrix is all clean and colorful, reality is dirty and cold. The parts of the dialogue who deal with essential questions (like &#132;what is the matrix`) are brilliantly written. (There's just that other  thing that irritates me when Morpheus tells Neo about how the machines got the power over humankind, he says humans darkened the sky so that the machines would stop working while the humans themselves  depended on the machines &#150;and therefore caused their own misery.  I always raise my left eyebrow when I see this part of the movie. Wouldn't it make more sense to say the irony comes from the fact that humans depend on the  sunlight and that way caused their own misery by darkening the sky? That analogy would work well with a lot of short-sighted actions humans have come up with over the centuries.) It's surprising to see subjects like this being discussed in a &#130;mainstream&#145; hollywood movie &#150;especially at that length. Since the Wachowski Brothers had troubles to get the project financed, it might not be that &#130;mainstream&#145; anyway. In fact, at least the outlook of the film is &#130;avant-garde&#145;. Ground-breaking camera-technology and breathtaking choreography of the fighting scenes team up with innovative direction. Neo's &#130;wake-up&#145; scene in the incubator, the showdown or &#130;the white room&#145; won't be forgotten so fast.Since the first human being was walking the planet, there have been speculations about what is real, if or how that might be proven, and what kind of consequences that might have. Therefore not too many themes could be more classical than the one of &#130;The Matrix&#145;. But it's not only classical, to some it might be scary it invites us to see parallels in our world, igniting questions about who &#150;based on what kind of legitimacy- makes all the rules and how much power each of us has in that game. The choice of the theme and the way the theme is presented is what truly makes this film the first film of the next millennium. It already has entered movie history.

A few years ago one of my kids was begging me to allow them to see it at the theaters. I said no, due to the fact that the film's star, Sylvester Stallone, is usually very obscene and foul. But I was wrong. What made his film an R-rated production is the violence, on the same level as Batman and any other childish super hero flick. But Judge Dread is adult, according to the MPAA, who have limited this movie as a children option by giving it an R. This movie is adolescent in every minute of its length, and when I saw the film last week, throughout the movie I was thinking to myself  This is ridiculous, both in comparison to the MPAA's rating and the movie's altogether badness. The film stars Sylvester Stallone as the title character, Judge Dread. However, before I get into the story, maybe it would be appropriate to develop a setting and atmosphere for you first. The time period is way in the future where violence is no longer a random occurrence, but a part of everyday life. Cities are filled to the rim with massive buildings, which mostly are in shambles, futuristic technology, and riots, killings, and nonstop uproar.By now you should be asking yourself who is keeping order here. Well, they call them the Judges; live action cartoon characters that have bulletproof armor all over their bodies, drive flying motorcycles, and have really big guns and a lot of guts. Since there is so much crime present, however, and the fact that the old  law system where a jury of twelve decides the fate of the criminal is impossible to keep up with here, the Judges are the jury, judge and executioner. If they chose to sentence someone to death it is kaboom right there on the spot. The most feared of the Judges Judge Dread, who has no mercy, compassion, or human emotions. I suppose the point of the movie is the discovery of sympathy for Dread.  Judge Dread has a pervasively overwhelming production design. The futuristic cities are so over the top in towering enormousness that looking at them almost makes us dizzy. I am not trying to say that is bad thing, but it is kind of recycled. And yes, there is lots more content here that is taken from other movies. Like the flying motorcycle scenes that were surly inspired for the pod racer sequences in Star Wars. And the whole concept of the futuristic mood and the powerful judges is sort of Terminator territory. Lets not forget about the combat scenes just like the ones in Demolition Man.The performances are not your Academy Award material here, to say he least. Big time action star Sylvester Stallone can't act worth a hill of beans. Or perhaps that is just because of his poorly developed character. Remember in Soldier (1998), where Kurt Russell, whom we all know can act very well, was developed in a way in which there was no possible way his performances could have been effective. Well, that may be the case here as well. Judge Dread is so boring in his character that I was actually rooting for the visually innovative bad guys to win. About those bad guys, they are wonderful. The filmmakers give us lots of variety in the villains. They vary from random acts of violence from rioters to cannibals who have captured Dread and plan for him to stay for their next meal, from revenge plots to brotherly un-love.

The format was excellent and Sarah Polley looks and acts like a young Uma Thurman (Pulp Fiction already?).Well, onto its parallels with Pulp Fiction, Go! reads like a younger sibling that's not quite smart enough or confusing enough to cream its elders but it is original all the same.The action is racy (as you would expect from something named Go!) and the comic bits are actually funny which makes it enough to be called a comedy\/drama. There are two sides to every character - one shown from another's point of view, and then from their own. Everyone is both a hero and a victim in their own right which makes Go! an exciting ride.

According to some critics it's still not worth sitting through. I disagree. While they did cut out about 50 pages of the book and do the entrance to the mother of the Wendol all bass-ackwards, it's still a very decent flick, especially if you enjoy watching somewhat historical flicks. Not bad for a spoof on Beowulf. Definitely a film to check out, I gave it a 9.

They're too busy trying to cater to the top $$$ demograhic, which leaves us with films such as Teaching Mrs Tingle and Brokedown Palace.  You all know the premise, Lola must come up with 100,000 DM ($25,000) in 20 minutes, or her man will reach his evolutionary limit.  What transpires is 3 versions of how it will go down, occuring within the same time constraints.A pretty cool concept, with even cooler cinematography. Lola is one in-shape Fraeulein, that is not afraid to lay it all on the line for her idiot boyfriend.  Of the 3 versions, I guess it's up to us to choose which one we like the most.Although for some, if you do not get sucked into the story in the first 5 mins, you're in for a long movie going experience.  The story is simple in nature, with hardly any character growth.  But it is the subtle variations in the early stages of each vignette that makes the viewer wonder what if, ala Sliding Doors.The inventive use of scanning a person's future through quick snapshots  is very refreshing and original (My favorite was the dominatrix banker). Although I enjoyed the fast paced style that RLR was shot\/edited\/sounds, i can see how this might turn away the mainstream audience, that is accustomed to the generic style of filmmaking that seems to be the norm. With the exception of directors such as Tarentino, the Wochowski brothers, and the Blair Witch dudes, it seems that fresh, cutting edge films will continue to resonate from overseas and film schools, where we all know they will never see the light of american mainstream.
