'The Shawshank Redemption' follows the maturation of a friendship over a thirty-year period, during which two men grow close in a cruel and brutal prison in New England. Based on a story by Stephen King, that author whose work has inspired such cheesy screen fare such as 'Thinner' and 'Needful Things', the film comes as a surprise. I had always though Forrest Gump was a great movie until I saw Shawshank. One of the strongest thoughts I had after seeing this film was that we, as a society, are wrong to sentence a man to endless years in prison. A controversial view, but it makes sense when compared to the world in the film. Hope, friendship, and an unwillingness to be broken are the main messages in a story that is beautifully filmed and flawlessly acted. Tim Robbins did deserve an Academy Award much more than Tom Hanks did, and I was disappointed to see that even Morgan Freeman's excellent turn as 'Red' slipped by Academy voters. Ah well, it's the same awards panel that gave the Best Picture nod to 'Titanic'. The world does not always make sense, 'Shawshank' teaches us.

If you have seen The Hitcher, you will love this movie for its similarities.  Both films were written by the same guy, and filmed a year apart.  Very atmospheric and depressing, this film is a cult favorite that must be seen to be appreciated.

Different from his earlier films, it's a post-modern carusel of violent MTV-like buzzcuts, all shot with different lenses and different filters, and accompanied by the greatest soundtrack ever. The plot is written by Quentin Tarantino, but the film stretches far beyond anything he could ever dream of creating. It gives a profound and angst-ridden view of American pop-culture, where the couple Mickey and Mallory Knox decide to take things into their own hands and rebel against a society that can never understand their love. The film successfully blends the aestethics and the rush of hardboiled violence with a  harshly satiricial view of the authorities, the media, and anyone with power. It also manages to go beyond the sometimes juvenile acts of random carnage in films like 'Reservoir dogs', and gives the impression of sincerity, of incredible insight, and of the appreciation that although it's fine to indulge in the beauty of blood and death, there are consequences that you have to accept.
