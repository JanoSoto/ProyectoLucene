I've been ready for something to blow it to pieces, and by the grace of the almighty god, we were given Shrek.*spoilers dead ahead*Like I said, Shrek makes fun of the run of the mill Disney fairy tale film. It's about this Oger named Shrek who lives in a swamp long ago. He lives in solitude (except for the occasional angry mob trying to kill him). Unfortuitly, for him and fairy tale things-(from the film)across the land, lord farquad, who is basically in charge of the place, says that all the fairy tales people must be taken to the swamp of Shrek's residence. Well to say the least, Shrek is not happy about this, so with his new donkey friend (whom he saved earlier) they we're on there way to protest to Lord Farquad. They finally get there (by the way his castle is a Disneyland wanna be). Shrek and donkey stumble upon the royal arena where something is going on (im not quite sure what). Anyway, as expected, everyone is afraid of shrek, and Farquad orders his knights to kill Shrek and donkey. Well, Shrek and donkey end up in a WWF style fight with the kinghts that is just hilarious. Because of this, Fraquad sends Shrek on a quest to find princess Fiona (you see, the talking mirror from Snow White told him that he should marry her, another hilarious scene). If Shrek finds Fiona and returns to Dulock (the name of the kingdom)with her, he gets the swomp back. This is surly a classic film, one that was completely different and extremely funny. With an all-star cast (Mike Myers, Eddie Murhpy, Camron Diaz, and John Ligthow) this is a delightful movie that everyone can enjoy. Thank you dreamworks, this is surly your trademark film. By the way, Shrek was such a great movie, they made a new category in the academy awards because of it (best animated film), if thats not the mark of a legendary film, I don't know what is.

I like him because of his scene of humour and a habit of always getting in trouble when Shrek needs him most. Donkey is one of those characters that never shuts up, he can sometimes get very annoying. Sometimes you just want to get rid of him but then he saves your life so you keep him following you.The animation in this film was quite amazing and it must have taken the producers a long time to get the film to this standard.

Body Heat is one of those films that puts a new spin on a genre that has been around for a long time.

When everyone lights up in a meeting discussing Turner's characters, Matty Walker, husband's will, Ted Danson declines disclaiming he'll just breath the air. Racine's friend, the detective, says when it gets so hot people think the rules don't apply to them, that if they break the rules nobody will notice. Well that's where they are wrong because this detective is on the case. You do the crime your gonna do the time buddy. Unless your an extremely sexy widow. Matty Walker gets away with murder, all her husbands money, and putting a semi-innocent man behind bars. But is she happy; hell no. She is sitting on a tropical island paradise stuck in misery. Why?

The movie is set in 1965, the first year of the declared war on Vietnam. However, we are looking at the 1980s white-washed version of the war and Vietnam itself during American occupation, which was typical to the decade in seeking to compensate for a war lost (also see Rambo).1965 may've been the start of the declared war, but Vietnam was a country in military struggle for most of it's existence. Just having fought a war with the French, I doubt that even the South Vietnamese setting was so peaceful and pleasant (though economically ravaged) as this movie shows you. But unfortunately, I suppose it would have to, in order to draw your attention to the story--the battle of the airwaves.Robin Williams plays Adrian Cronauer, an air force transferee who gets assigned to the local radio broadcasting station in Saigon. He is central to the movie's attempt at being defiant. But defiant against what? The war? Unruly authority? Given the way the story fluctuates and the various importance on several characters (not just Williams's character), it's hard to tell. Cronauer's unusual broadcasting personality makes him popular against the soldiers in the field, but he is a thorn in the side of his superiors, Steven Hauk (Bruno Kirby) and Phillip Dickerson (JT Walsh) who prefer he stick to format. Cronauer is a hit with his monologues and rock n' roll hour. He's a pretty tough character, not caring much about the threats from Hauk and Dickerson, knowing that he's doing something good for the soldiers at least, who seem to enjoy it. He tests the waters with his commanding officers, however, when he tries to read the censored news bulletins on aired, hoping to remove the illusion of a happy war. But, even here, it doesn't seem like Cronauer is much of a character that stands out as a defiant one, and it looks like his actions had absolutely no effect on the soldier or anything like that (at least as far as the movie shows you). So where they were going with this aspect of the plot is pretty unclear (or perhaps, unfinished).This is typical Robin Williams comedy, let loose for quite a few minutes at a time to splurge on semi-humorous monologues (at least when he doesn't do his impersonations so fast that you can't discern what he's saying). It is funny at moments, but most of the jokes are pretty stupid. It is nothing exciting, nor particularly engaging (though he does have some funny dialogue when it comes from the script). The more interesting secondary characters such as Forrest Whitakker are hardly developed in any sort of interest at all, and probably would've been necessary anyway to get some direction for this damned story and from the central character. This is not one movie that I really enjoyed with some exception, and I fail to see what the big fuss is about it after all these years.

He offers another gem of a performance in this one. He was found on a stormy night be Sensei and was named Haru, the prophisized Great White Ninja. The beginning of the film shows him training to be a ninja, with such funny stunts as him trying to lift a burning cauldron with his open forearms, spilling it all over the others. On the day of truth, he is not selected to graduate and become a ninja. The plot of the story is simply this - He is proposed by Allison Page to help her in a steal mission against a counterfeiter. Not all goes to plan when he witnesses a killing. He uses the matchbook that Allison gave him to determine that he must go to Beverly Hills in her aid. Little things like Farley leaving his shoes at the door of the hotel everytime he enters (and the janitor sweeping them up everytime) shows his native roots. The director was great at adding such small but noticeable tendencies to make it more realistic.Farley walks around looking for Allison dressed as a pimp - he is supposed to blend in with the locals - but that is not a good way to do it. All the while Gobbei, the best ninja declared by Sensei can be seen on the otherhand with his face painted to look like he is part of a statue. Throughout the movie he helps Haru and is his shadow to make sure he succeeds in his mission without Haru knowing he is being helped. Now forget the plot, it isn't going to win any awards. The meat of the film - what you really are there to see is Chris Farley pull off his hijinx. Funny scenes such as when he is in a Beverly Hills strip joint and he is up on stage and sees a hot stripper, he shakes his fists and says repeatedly I am one with the universe, I am one with the universe as a ninja SHOULD be, but he cannot resist her and starts dancing along side her, comically rubbing his nipples and then revealing his tight white undershirt which he attempts to rip. The crowd of men, all the while are cheering for him and he falls off the stage flat on his back breaking a table and is thrown out by the bouncers. Then when two men are shot out the buildings window by Tanley's goons and land by the garbage where Haru has been pushed, an Asian ladies repeatedly screams out the window which is classic and made me laugh. Another great scene is when Farley staying on his quest to help foil Tanley's plan, goes in disguise into a Japanese restaurant as a sushi cook person. This is the funniest point in the film and involves Farley flipping a shrimp down a woman's dress and he pulls it from her breasts, sniffing it and making some sort of funny comment.

He offers another gem of a performance in this one. He was found on a stormy night be Sensei and was named Haru, the prophisized Great White Ninja. The beginning of the film shows him training to be a ninja, with such funny stunts as him trying to lift a burning cauldron with his open forearms, spilling it all over the others. On the day of truth, he is not selected to graduate and become a ninja. The plot of the story is simply this - He is proposed by Allison Page to help her in a steal mission against a counterfeiter. Not all goes to plan when he witnesses a killing. He uses the matchbook that Allison gave him to determine that he must go to Beverly Hills in her aid. Little things like Farley leaving his shoes at the door of the hotel everytime he enters (and the janitor sweeping them up everytime) shows his native roots. The director was great at adding such small but noticeable tendencies to make it more realistic.Farley walks around looking for Allison dressed as a pimp - he is supposed to blend in with the locals - but that is not a good way to do it. All the while Gobbei, the best ninja declared by Sensei can be seen on the otherhand with his face painted to look like he is part of a statue. Throughout the movie he helps Haru and is his shadow to make sure he succeeds in his mission without Haru knowing he is being helped. Now forget the plot, it isn't going to win any awards. The meat of the film - what you really are there to see is Chris Farley pull off his hijinx. Funny scenes such as when he is in a Beverly Hills strip joint and he is up on stage and sees a hot stripper, he shakes his fists and says repeatedly I am one with the universe, I am one with the universe as a ninja SHOULD be, but he cannot resist her and starts dancing along side her, comically rubbing his nipples and then revealing his tight white undershirt which he attempts to rip. The crowd of men, all the while are cheering for him and he falls off the stage flat on his back breaking a table and is thrown out by the bouncers. Then when two men are shot out the buildings window by Tanley's goons and land by the garbage where Haru has been pushed, an Asian ladies repeatedly screams out the window which is classic and made me laugh. Another great scene is when Farley staying on his quest to help foil Tanley's plan, goes in disguise into a Japanese restaurant as a sushi cook person. This is the funniest point in the film and involves Farley flipping a shrimp down a woman's dress and he pulls it from her breasts, sniffing it and making some sort of funny comment.

After the bizarre title sequence comes an even more bizarre opening scene featuring an expositional voice over complete with a corny song called  Turkey Buzzard . Structure wise this is somewhat similar to the opening of NO BLADE OF GRASS released a year later but in terms of execution it resembles THE DUKES OF HAZZARD .

As the film moves on to the story proper more and more ridiculous things take centre stage .

Many of these characters are played by big name actors ( They don`t come much bigger than Edward G Robinson ) which led me to shriek  Hey I know where this is heading .

I saw it first when I was about 5 and only liked it because of its fantastic car chases but when I actually got it on video and watched it again I just couldn't stop laughing. The cast is excellent with plenty of famous legends in there and plenty of brilliant cameos as well. The plot is so simple and it seems so easy A dying gangster who literally kicks the bucket, tells 8 motorists that there's $350,000 200 miles away buried under a big W. He's giving it to them. So basically the motorists try to come to an agreement on how they will split the money between them, but in the end it becomes every man for himself and whoever gets there first gets it all. Thats preety much it. And yet, basically everything that could go wrong does. All the characters have countless numbers of problems along their way there. Its an all out war and they won't let anything stand in their way, but to be fair who would when there's 350,000 on offer! Anyway, many people said this film was too long but if you ask me the length didn't bother me at all and in fact I found it better as they were able to fit more gags and celebrities in. The last 30 minutes is my favourite and the ending is my favourite of all time. I won't spoil it for you but I can tell you that when you're watching it, it really does make you think more about the title of the film.The Script and Direction is brilliant but the best is the Score which should have won an Oscar. It is one of the greatest in film history. Enough said. I was also very impressed with the spectacular car chases and crashes which are done superbly for a film that was made 40 years ago and with such a tiny budget. When you compare the re-make Rat Race to this film it doesn't even come close and as far as I'm concerned even though Rat Race is a very funny film the ending is terrible compared to this one.Anyway thats enough of me I give this film 10\/10 Get up and go and rent or buy it now!

Since their first pairing in the brilliant noir thriller 'I Walk Alone' (1947), Lancaster and Douglas had made several appearances together. Who can forget Lancaster's tough talking Wyatt Earp and Douglas's equally tough yet terminally ill Doc Holliday in 'Gunfight at the OK Corral'? So now it was the mid 80's, the age of the pepsi generation, I wondered how these two consistent stars would adapt to staring together again for the first time since the 60's. The answer is brilliant.Harry Doyle (Lancaster), and Archie Long (Douglas) are released from prison after a 30 years sentence after being caught dead bang robbing a train. Eager to make a clean sweep, the two senior citizens, are looking forward to starting their new legitimate lives. However, all is not as they had hoped on the outside, and Harry and Archie have problems coming to terms with the way the world has changed. Director Kanew gives us a new genre here. Instead of the 'fish out of water' scenario, we have the 'two fishes that have been put back in the water after a severely long time' genre. However, Kanew also gives the audience the inevitable Clichés that go with it, and is always ready to fall back on a youth versus experience incident just about everytime the movie gets enjoyable. After being humiliated, patronised, and generally treated like dirt for the better part of a week, The two ageing gangsters decide that a life of crime has to be better then honest work, and predictably they revert to their previous careers as train robbers.The film is enjoyable there's no escaping it, but there are more holes in the plot than there are in a grannies cardigan, and is also SOoooo predictable in fact the films outcome is more predictable than the outcome of a fight betwix elephant and duck. First of all to get 30 years simply for robbing a train, seems a bit excessive for the viewer to even find it believable. Co-incidentally the day the get out of prison is 1 week before the train they were caught robbing is making it's farewell run.This aside the film IS enjoyable, and Lancaster and Douglas play their parts wonderfully and you enjoy the film more for their presence. Other cast members also rate highly, Eli Wallach is by far the funniest character, and his wonderful performance in some ways steals the film from it's intended stars. and the devine Alexis Smith makes a small cameo as Lancaster's ex lover. Charles Durning is unfortunately once again typecast as the over-weight lazy flatfoot (ala Dog Day Afternoon\/The Sting) and although his performances are always good, you get tired pretty quickly of his tough talking patronising character. and finally there is (Pre Wayne's World) Dana Carvey as the Youthful Idealistic Parole Officer, but it's a shame that Carvey is restricted to playing pretty much a straight character, especially considering he is probably one of the funniest men working in Hollywood today.Tough Guys should have been better, but I feel Kanew spent most of the budget on getting the perfect Sterling cast, rather than to hire a good script writer. Worth watching for the final appearance on-screen of this top notch duo. Since Lancaster's Death in 1994, I've warmed to this movie more knowing it could never happen again. It's just a shame it wasn't better as it could have been much better.

After being humiliated, patronised, and generally treated like dirt for the better part of a week, The two ageing gangsters decide that a life of crime has to be better then honest work, and predictably they revert to their previous careers as train robbers.The film is enjoyable there's no escaping it, but there are more holes in the plot than there are in a grannies cardigan, and is also SOoooo predictable in fact the films outcome is more predictable than the outcome of a fight betwix elephant and duck. First of all to get 30 years simply for robbing a train, seems a bit excessive for the viewer to even find it believable. Co-incidentally the day the get out of prison is 1 week before the train they were caught robbing is making it's farewell run.This aside the film IS enjoyable, and Lancaster and Douglas play their parts wonderfully and you enjoy the film more for their presence. Other cast members also rate highly, Eli Wallach is by far the funniest character, and his wonderful performance in some ways steals the film from it's intended stars. and the devine Alexis Smith makes a small cameo as Lancaster's ex lover. Charles Durning is unfortunately once again typecast as the over-weight lazy flatfoot (ala Dog Day Afternoon\/The Sting) and although his performances are always good, you get tired pretty quickly of his tough talking patronising character. and finally there is (Pre Wayne's World) Dana Carvey as the Youthful Idealistic Parole Officer, but it's a shame that Carvey is restricted to playing pretty much a straight character, especially considering he is probably one of the funniest men working in Hollywood today.Tough Guys should have been better, but I feel Kanew spent most of the budget on getting the perfect Sterling cast, rather than to hire a good script writer. Worth watching for the final appearance on-screen of this top notch duo. Since Lancaster's Death in 1994, I've warmed to this movie more knowing it could never happen again. It's just a shame it wasn't better as it could have been much better.

You can shoot a feature-length movie on a home video camera with bad lighting, and it can still be good as long as the script is well-written and the characters are engaging.  In this case, the characters aren't engaging.  First off, it's harder to make an interesting film about wealthy Hollywood types.  It's better to make movies about ordinary people, with whom the audience can relate.  I just felt distant from these characters, and I found it hard to get wrapped up in their lives.  The director throws the audience a couple of curve balls, but they come off as more pretentious than nifty.  The film's strong points lie in its concepts, but the execution is poor.

The ensemble cast of popular film and TV actors is definitely talented, but good acting can't save bad material.  One of the reasons why I was interested in seeing the movie is because I heard that all the dialogue is improvised by the actors.

It was on the night before and I had to get it. I love this movie. Every character in it is an individual. When I told my mother and sister what the movie was about they looked at me with a look on their face that said He's a hit-man. He's--a--hit-man. Who said hit men can't have a soul? This one does. The detail of character in this movie is stunning. It has no shame either, and proudly displays images and moments with the raw truth. This little girl does bleed, she does see violence and filth, she does smoke cigarettes and gets slapped by her father. She has no sorrow for her dead and useless family, only her innocent little brother. A hit-man is her idol because he showed her kindness, he did more for her than her family ever did.Leon himself is a great guy. I found myself wanting to be like him at some points. Even though he is a killer, the man has morals. He has more morals than anyone in any other action movie with explosions and such that I've ever seen. He's very swift on his feet and even though he seems like a very serious person, he can laugh and grin a large smile. The character is just so natural, so graceful in acting. Like I said, detail is shown very well in this movie. Ooh, my favorite though...OH, MY FAVORITE...!...Is Gary Oldman's character, Stansfield. I LOVE him! The moment he comes onto the screen my face lights up like cigarette ). I was actually attracted to him because of his character....Ooh, so deliciously evil! He delivers comedy and cruelty all in one, and he holds that gun so well! I loved how close he got to people. To tell you the truth, it made me a little uncomfortable, haha. But he got so close to Mathilda. Just him and her, and he's poking a gun right in her face. It just goes to show how merciless and serious he can be. I was happy to see the extra scene they cut out from TV right afterward when Willie comes in and interrupts and he's deciding what to do with her. Stansfield is so strange and shifty, he motions to her awkwardly with the gun to come with them, but then suddenly points it at her and takes aim, but then just thinks to himself forget it and puts his arm down. Great character. The storyline itself is good too. No one is afraid to talk about\/do things that a lot of other movies won't do. They don't censor out what makes people seem real. They give a 12 year old knowledge she shouldn't know and ways of acting that most parents would shudder at. The hit-man is human and considers what he does a job and when he's not doing his job he's a very decent human being. The villain is a little wacky, but he pulls it off very nicely. He fits the part of a psycho perfectly. The lines in the movie can be catchy and touching, little moments make it all worthwhile. The scene where she walks past her dead family and up to Leon's door is so amazing. She's crying helplessly for him to open the door. I mean, you really can see it in her eyes that she's begging. Wonderful acting, especially for such a young actress. It amazes me how well she does with adults, right in her face too, and all the adult related topics too that she deals with. Anyway, I wish I could write more passionately and interestingly as do a lot of people who write comments, but I just don't think I have a large enough vocabulary.

Although it's not quite the UNMITIGATED disaster some claim, *Eyes Wide Shut* is still pretty ludicrous there will be no later revising-upward of critical opinion, a la*2001 A Space Odyssey*. It will rather be remembered for more morbid reasons; to wit, for killing Kubrick and sundering the marriage of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.For the real-life peripherals surrounding the movie were more interesting than the movie itself -- which, I'm sorry to say, is really, really, really old hat for cinephiles. I realize that this film and its director have a huge fan-club, as evidenced by hundreds of glowing -- if naive -- reviews on this website, but please spare me the lectures that my dislike of the film indicates that I just don't get it. No, YOU don't get it. *Eyes Wide Shut* is art-house cinema for the lazy people, for the people who can't be bothered to force themselves to watch all those subtitled foreign movies from several decades ago that have already, and AMPLY, covered this same material. Doubtless, these same lazy people haven't bothered to read much Schnitzler or even Freud, for that matter. And thus, they're not bored to death by *Eyes Wide Shut*. They see genius, while I'm looking at the same old thing. I dunno, but from where I sit, Schnitzler's psycho-sexual theories, while provocative in the mid-Twenties when he wrote the story on which this film is based, are anachronisms in today's culture that boasts of an 50%+ divorce rate. And so what's the result of Kubrick's unwieldy update of 1920's-Vienna to 1999-New York City? Total absurdity, when we realize that Tom Cruise's character, Bill I'm-A-Doctor Harford, is actually amazed that his wife once had a sexual fantasy involving a Naval officer. The whole ludicrous situation is laid out in a ludicrous scene, in which we also learn that Nicole Kidman is so unsatisfied as a wife that a mere GLANCE from the Navy guy would've caused her to abandon her husband and young daughter. I don't know any women who would behave in such a way. (I've only read them in Freud.)This all drives poor Dr. Harford quite mad (dear God, perhaps she even had sexual partners BEFORE I EVEN MET HER!), and he hits the street (an unrecognizable New York City -- the movie was filmed, obviously, in London), looking for a good time. Or something. I guess the idea here is revenge against his wife's dirty, dirty thoughts. Or something. Without belaboring the plot-points, let's just say that he ends up visiting hookers, nubile daughters of haberdashers, among others, but Kubrick doesn't permit our hero(TOM CRUISE, okay?) to actually score. But then, the whole silly thing is unlikely in the first place. Eventually the movie gets to its centerpiece a campy orgy straight out of a De Sade spoof, with waving incense, chants, creepy electro-organ music, and hundreds of interchangeable naked girls wearing only high-heels and really cool Venetian masks. We are, I believe, meant to nod wisely at Kubrick's commentary concerning the impersonality of sex outside the sacred marriage bond. *Eyes Wide Shut*, in others words, is a movie made by a happily married man of 4 decades.By the time we get to the orgy, the bored cinephile's only interest is considering how much better Fellini would've done this sort of thing. After all, Fellini, though sloppy, was a true surrealist . . . and along those lines, Bunuel would've made a sheer masterpiece of this movie. But Kubrick was inspired, so many years ago, by the dour Antonioni they each certainly had their share of bourgeois baggage to bring to their work. The point being, this is a movie without any heat, without any fun. The focus is on the backlash of erotic freedom, with the supposed irony of our hero's not being able to actually enjoy any of that freedom during the course of the film. Some here have found this to be profound, and perhaps it would've seemed more profound to me if this film had been a period piece set in, say, the 1800's -- a time in which sexual autonomy was strictly a deeply private idea to be smothered in guilt and the flames of Hell. But in 1999's New York, it's a weird and ultimately pointless anachronism. And sadly it's not even redeemed with the usual photographic brilliance one expects from Kubrick the picture is grainy, gritty, and even glaring (you keep having this urge to turn down either your color or the contrast on your TV set), overly schematic in terms of color-coding (blue lighting indicates chasteness; red lighting indicates erotic danger). Indeed, the whole movie is full of shallow symbols a la the lighting -- the perfect movie, in other words, for film grads writing their thesis. What a bore.I'll refrain from adding in-depth to the countless comments about the inanity of the dialogue and the tepidness of the performances.

I realize that this film and its director have a huge fan-club, as evidenced by hundreds of glowing -- if naive -- reviews on this website, but please spare me the lectures that my dislike of the film indicates that I just don't get it. No, YOU don't get it. *Eyes Wide Shut* is art-house cinema for the lazy people, for the people who can't be bothered to force themselves to watch all those subtitled foreign movies from several decades ago that have already, and AMPLY, covered this same material. Doubtless, these same lazy people haven't bothered to read much Schnitzler or even Freud, for that matter. And thus, they're not bored to death by *Eyes Wide Shut*. They see genius, while I'm looking at the same old thing. I dunno, but from where I sit, Schnitzler's psycho-sexual theories, while provocative in the mid-Twenties when he wrote the story on which this film is based, are anachronisms in today's culture that boasts of an 50%+ divorce rate. And so what's the result of Kubrick's unwieldy update of 1920's-Vienna to 1999-New York City? Total absurdity, when we realize that Tom Cruise's character, Bill I'm-A-Doctor Harford, is actually amazed that his wife once had a sexual fantasy involving a Naval officer. The whole ludicrous situation is laid out in a ludicrous scene, in which we also learn that Nicole Kidman is so unsatisfied as a wife that a mere GLANCE from the Navy guy would've caused her to abandon her husband and young daughter. I don't know any women who would behave in such a way. (I've only read them in Freud.)This all drives poor Dr. Harford quite mad (dear God, perhaps she even had sexual partners BEFORE I EVEN MET HER!), and he hits the street (an unrecognizable New York City -- the movie was filmed, obviously, in London), looking for a good time. Or something. I guess the idea here is revenge against his wife's dirty, dirty thoughts. Or something. Without belaboring the plot-points, let's just say that he ends up visiting hookers, nubile daughters of haberdashers, among others, but Kubrick doesn't permit our hero(TOM CRUISE, okay?) to actually score. But then, the whole silly thing is unlikely in the first place. Eventually the movie gets to its centerpiece a campy orgy straight out of a De Sade spoof, with waving incense, chants, creepy electro-organ music, and hundreds of interchangeable naked girls wearing only high-heels and really cool Venetian masks. We are, I believe, meant to nod wisely at Kubrick's commentary concerning the impersonality of sex outside the sacred marriage bond. *Eyes Wide Shut*, in others words, is a movie made by a happily married man of 4 decades.By the time we get to the orgy, the bored cinephile's only interest is considering how much better Fellini would've done this sort of thing. After all, Fellini, though sloppy, was a true surrealist . . . and along those lines, Bunuel would've made a sheer masterpiece of this movie. But Kubrick was inspired, so many years ago, by the dour Antonioni they each certainly had their share of bourgeois baggage to bring to their work. The point being, this is a movie without any heat, without any fun. The focus is on the backlash of erotic freedom, with the supposed irony of our hero's not being able to actually enjoy any of that freedom during the course of the film. Some here have found this to be profound, and perhaps it would've seemed more profound to me if this film had been a period piece set in, say, the 1800's -- a time in which sexual autonomy was strictly a deeply private idea to be smothered in guilt and the flames of Hell. But in 1999's New York, it's a weird and ultimately pointless anachronism. And sadly it's not even redeemed with the usual photographic brilliance one expects from Kubrick the picture is grainy, gritty, and even glaring (you keep having this urge to turn down either your color or the contrast on your TV set), overly schematic in terms of color-coding (blue lighting indicates chasteness; red lighting indicates erotic danger). Indeed, the whole movie is full of shallow symbols a la the lighting -- the perfect movie, in other words, for film grads writing their thesis. What a bore.I'll refrain from adding in-depth to the countless comments about the inanity of the dialogue and the tepidness of the performances. I'll only say this much not much of a surprise here, given the director's track record with bad star performances in favor of quirky minor players who enliven things a bit in his movies. Needless to say, these bit parts by talented character actors add just about the only enjoyable elements to a sad last at-bat from Stanley Kubrick.

He may now be the hottest directorial talent around now (with a little trilogy by the name of Lord of the Rings giving him a push in the right direction) but before all that he was notorious around the cult circle for his excessively gruesome yet incredibly funny horror\/splatter movies.As entertaining as these movies may be, they are not cinematic gold like Lord of the Rings or this gem that he churned out in the early 90's. In fact it was this type of movie that proved to the world that Jackson can be a mature and adult film maker if given the right material (another example would be Steven Spielberg and Schindler's List).This film takes place between the years of 1952 and 1954 and focuses on two young schoolgirls that develop a bizarre friendship in which they create a fantasy world that only they know about. When their relationship appears to become something more than just mutural friends their parents try to put and end to it by separating the two, ending with tragic results.As with every Peter Jackson movie the film starts off with his usual bravado and energy with the performances played out with his slightly OTT take on the world. There is not a bad performance in this movie, and it also displays Jackson's ability for spotting new talent (this was Kate Winslet's first big role).However when the relationship starts to take a turn for the worse, Jackson shows his talent as a great film maker. The performances become more subtle and eerily precise as the truly shocking reality of what will happen starts to unfold. The leading ladies become more disturbing than any screen psycho to date, with the added oomph that they are just children.The ending is the icing on the cake for me and i know that'll sound sick and sadistic to anyone who has had the pleasure of seeing this film, but it just proves what a disturbing picture this is. It shows how far, too far can go and how strong the relationship was if, in the end, it would lead to murder to keep them together.This is a movie that is endlessly watchable. Definitely a more mature and adult film than the rest of his cannon (apart from LOTR of course) and it also showed the start of what would become a truly great talent that would dominate Hollywood ten years later.

You sit down to watch this movie and expect what you always get which is a film with a point that is explained to you (the audience) through the story and you (still the audience) get to the end and say Ahhhh I see what they are trying to say with this film and you either like it or you don't.Well boys and girls this film will leave you (thrice the audience) going, what the hell was that about? and then you will watch it again and still the message of the movie will not be apparent.  You will go to your friends and discuss the movie and then you will find each of you will have a different messagew this movie gave them, each of you will have found a different meaning to the film and each of you will have got something different from it.This is because the writer has clearly put the point of the movie to one side and simply told a story, the basis of all film is the audience take a journey and experience things through the characters and then are educated and\/or entertained.  Most movies these days are trying to bombard us with super objective (that's the message of the movie) and sometimes movies suffer for this.  This film doesn't, you watch it and then you get whatever you want or need to get from it.

However my Uncle has great taste in music and has introduced me to many great bands and albums over the years, especially 60's rock music.I think my initial reaction to the film was it had some great scenes, mixing fantastic music with iconic imagery, some very interesting cast members, and a very strange dark humour throughout most of it.The scenes which I were first really drawn to were 1951\/what about the boy? (whether Oliver Reed can sing or not without severe editing, he fits his part perfectly and both he and Ann-Margaret shine during this scene), Acid Queen (an amazing performance by Tina Turner) and Amazing Journey.Due to enjoying these songs\/scenes so much I revisited the film a few times and then really found the true depth of the movie. The songs are top notch, with the above mentioned and others such as Christmas, Pinball Wizard, I'm Free, Sally Simpson and Listening To You amongst the best. Every scene is almost mesmerising in it's own way (apart from Eyesight to the blind, although I love Eric Clapton, I just do not enjoy this part at all).I had been looking for this on DVD for sometime, and in the meantime had purchased the original CD (interesting how some songs are better on the CD whilst others translate better in the movie) as a substitute. I was of course extremely pleased at the recent 2 Disc Collectors Edition release and did not hesitate to make my purchase.OK, the story is not your run of the mill, easy to understand type and I think it is open to all kinds of interpretations, the main thing is the movie is a visual and musical feast almost like an extended ultra good pop video.

While some of the actors manage to give some life to their portrayals and give some life to the period (1920s), most of this tale stays dead in the water.Worst performance I have seen for a long time on the screen - Eddie Izzard as Charlie Chaplin.  Please.  Black hair, a bad haircut and brown contacts do not a complex comedy genius make.  An awful, inept, poor performance from an excellent comedian who has grown into a deeply disappointing actor.Kirsten Dunst is a looks-perfect but too young Marion Davies, who has none of the personality the real Miss Davies projected in her films such as Show People.  Cary Elwes is ok as Thomas Ince but that's about it, you can't imagine him being one of the driving forces of 1910s cinema.  Edward Herrmann I thought was good as Hearst until about the last third of the film where he went too over-the-top.  But you do get some sense of the jealousy and hunger for power which drove the newspaper magnate, even of his love for Marion (a love which incidentally lasted for many decades).Joanna Lumley is an interesting Elinor Glyn - the woman who coined the phrase 'It Girl'.  Elinor Glyn died eight years before William Randolph Hearst and yet she narrates this story and talks about what happened 'after the old man's death'.  These things may not matter to the main story but they are irritating.And was Louella Parsons really such a silly nitwit in her younger days before settling into her key role in the Hearst newspaper empire?  Jennifer Tilly would make you think so, and quickly outstays her welcome.The story itself is that old chestnut story about what caused the death of Thomas Ince in 1924 while on a trip for his birthday on Hearst's yacht.  Accompanied by his girlfriend, Margeret Livingston (played well by Claudia Harrison), and some irritating squealing women, he is hoping to strike a business deal with Hearst.  But things don't quite go to plan.'The Cat's Meow' is a turkey, only worth a mention for the good for its costumes and music (by far the highlight is Al Jolson's version of 'Avalon' as the opening credits roll).  Otherwise, avoid.
