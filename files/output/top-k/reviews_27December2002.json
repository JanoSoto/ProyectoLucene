[{"date":"27 December 2002","score":"","review":"  Election is definitely one of my favorite movies from the past five years. I recall when it was first advertised, I figured it would be another campy teen comedy (of which I am a fan) that would be lighthearted and fun. Heck, it was an MTV movie.   I couldn't have been more wrong.Matthew Broderick is so great in this movie because you keep expecting him to lighten up on Reese Witherspoon, just to show that he is messing with her.  Witherspoon, spectacular as always, is convincing as the ambitious Track Flick.  I kept expecting her character go down the wrong path at some point but she followed her dreams and became quite successful.Broderick's character is a great example of what can happen to an individual when they become overconsumed with hatred towards another person.  After a while, I felt sorry for him but disliked him because he was so mean-spirited.  In the end, this movie does have very funny moments but it is by no means an easygoing film.  I recommend it to anyone that like movies with an edge.   ","genre":null},{"date":"27 December 2002","score":"","review":"  Election is definitely one of my favorite movies from the past five years.
