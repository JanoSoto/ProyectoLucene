All of those elements make Die Hard With A Vengeance a great Action sequel that is Bruce Willis and John McTierman at their best and is one of the best Action films of the 1990s.Set in New York City,Die Hard With A Vengeance has John McClane(Bruce Willis)who is now back in New York City as a NYPD cop and has to deal with a terrorist named Simon(Jeremy Irons)who is setting off bombs in the city and wants to play a game of Simon Says with John who is about to have a very bad day. Now,with the help of Harlem shop owner Zeus(Samuel L. Jackson)John McClane must put a stop to Simon and save the city.Die Hard With A Vengeance is a brilliant and thrilling Action sequel that reunited star Bruce Willis and director John McTierman(director of the first film)and created one of the best and most entertaining Action movies of the 1990s that was also my first introduction to the Die Hard series and the character John McClane and right behind the first film is my favorite Die Hard film. Die Hard With A Vengeance is an absolute blast from start to finish and is a movie that(literally)starts off with a bang instantly grabbing viewers by the throat and never letting go until the very end giving viewers a movie that is true Popcorn Movie,a film that is just memorable and fun. One of the things that makes DH3 so entertaining and watchable is the storyline because where as the first two films were set in one specific location(Nakatomi building Die Hard,Airport in Die Hard 2)DH3 takes the concept a step further using the entire city of New York as it's location which makes the movie more intense and exciting with a large scale and open space for creative scenes. Next to Bruce Willis New York City is pretty much the star of the movie and viewers see many locations of the Big Apple. The Action sequences in DH3 are amazing and intense and some of the biggest Action scenes in the Die Hard franchise with gunfights and explosions all around with the Action and thrills going at a terrific pace. DH3 is also an adventure in the truest sense of the word because there is chase sequences and various other things that happen throughout the film which will put viewers on the edge of their seats. While I did enjoy Die Hard 2 I felt the second film lacked some of the Comedic aspects of the first and thankfully the Humor was beck in this film. The Humor in DH3 is hilarious and is definitely on par with the first film in terms of laughs thanks to some of the dialog and moments in the film. The Comedy and Humor is also funny thanks to the pairing of the characters John McClane and Zeus who's back and forth banter is some of the funniest stuff you will see in a Die Hard movie and at times makes DH3 almost like a buddy Action Comedy which I think adds to the movie. When we see the character John McClane in this movie he is in a different position than he was in the first two films. In DH3 McClane is separated from his estranged wife,he's a cop on suspension and he's drunk with a bad hangover and is basically a guy down on his luck. Now,McClane has a chance to become a hero again and redeem himself by doing something he doesn't want to dosave the day and just like in the other Die Hard films we are rooting for John McClane. The ending in Die Hard With A Vengeance is terrific and filled with enough Action and excitement that will satisfy viewers. It's an ending that is not only true to Action movies but true to the whole Die Hard series. A great ending.The cast is wonderful. Bruce Willis is excellent once again as John McClane,with Willis being charismatic,cool and likable. Jeremy Irons is brilliant and unforgettable as terrorist Simon,with Irons commanding the screen in every scene he's in. Samuel L. Jackson is terrific and fun as Zeus and has great scenes and chemistry with Willis. Graham Greene(Joe Lambert),Collen Camp(Connie),Larry Bryggman(Walter Cobb),Anthony Peck(Ricky Walsh),Nick Wyman(Mathias Targo),Sam Phillips(Katya),Kevin Chamberlin(Charles Weiss),Sharon Washington(Officer Jane),Stephen Pearlman(Dr. Fred Schiller),Michael Alexander Jackson(Dexter),Aldis Hodge(Raymond),Charles Dumas(FBI Agent Andy Cross),Michael Cristofer(Bill Jarvis,from Another Organization)give good performances as well.The direction by John McTierman is fantastic,with McTierman always moving the camera and giving the movie a great pace and style and doing a terrific job with the Action scenes. Great direction,McTierman.The score by Michael Kamen is incredible,suspense and intense once again and matches the film perfectly. Fine score,Kamen. There is also the classic song Summer In The City by The Lovin' Spoonful that plays in the beginning of the film.In final word,if you love Bruce Willis,John McTierman or Action Movies.I highly suggest you see Die Hard With A Vengeance,an excellent,thrilling and explosive sequel that you can watch again and again.

Yes I know this could be seen as heresy but I must confess to never thinking a great deal about this film despite being a life long Arnie fan.We all know the score with this film by now. The plot is based loosely on a Stephen King novel which is all about America being a police or totalitarian state, huge divides between the rich and the poor and of course death and violence being a popular much watched sport on TV. So basically a futuristic view on the ancient Roman civilisation and their bloody culture.If you think about it its the perfect role for Arnie and various other muscle men just like many other Arnie films, this film pretty much started that craze. Today this kind of story is completely unoriginal but back then it was almost the first of its kind. To be fair its a video game adaptation all the way, Arnie's character must face each stalker one by one, each has their own unique skill or weapon and they all have their personal level or stage as it were. Guess what Sub Zero's stage looks like?The stalkers are pretty clichéd and generic now when you look back, Fireball Sub Zero Dynamo Buzzsaw and Captain Freedom, not hard to figure out what they all do...accept for Freedom perhaps. A pumped bunch to say the least, Ventura looks full on steroids with his silly wig whilst Brown has a ridiculous wig himself (I think). The other stalker cast members aren't as famous accept for Charles Kalani Jr. perhaps but 80's female action sidekick regular María Conchita Alonso alongside Yaphet Kotto hold their own.Of course the film is made by the excellent performance of Richard Dawson who takes a creepy direction on what was his current job at the time as a gameshow host. Not only does Dawson ham it up nicely but he adds a very eerie, sadistic, two faced approach to the role. Its actually quite fun to watch him crawl and grovel to the audience. A real slime ball deviously charming the gullible live audience, whilst virtually blackmailing them for their trust and ratings by lavishing easy prizes upon them with seemingly genuine generosity. It did make you wonder if this was how real gameshow hosts behaved behind closed doors but I imagine that was the goal.The film does look pretty cheap, it did even back then. Sets are not much more than big empty spaces with stark lighting effects and piles of rubble everywhere. Hell even the costumes look like they've been handmade by the cast themselves. Lots of spandex, a basic ice hockey uniform, lots of leather n chains for background thugs and the most bizarre concept for Dynamo who is covered in what looks like Christmas tree lights stuck on transparent plastic body sections. Why does he sing opera? judging by his helmet its a homage or calling to 'Ride of the Valkyries' and the character is clearly trying to impose fear and terror on his pending victims as he rides his buggy thing into battle. Doesn't work too well though huh.Quick one for you, who on earth knows what Captain Freedom's outfit was suppose to do or be? looked like something out of He-Man. There's a lot more hinting at moments than actual visual sequences but there is the odd classic moment. I'm sure everyone recalls the infamous head explosion sequence, the ultra fast toboggan thing that transports Arnie down to the gauntlet game zone and Arnie slamming a pen into some scrawny pen pushing suits back...wince moment...ouch!Its your classic dystopian futuristic 80's action flick obviously, with the classic update of gladiatorial battles for the blood thirsty masses. Many have copied it but clearly this borrowed from other sources also ('Escape from New York' visually). Jammed packed with all the Arnie one liners you could want, dancing big haired blondes, some good bloody moments and a perfectly sleazy performance by real ex-gameshow host Dawson as the manipulative gameshow host Killian (nasty sounding name also).Predictable of course but its fun to watch the audience and viewers slowly get behind Richards as he defeats the stalkers one at a time. Watching Killian and his yes men squirm as they know Richards is coming to get them. A bit silly how this one act of rebellion seems to bring down the whole corrupt system as the resistance starts to broadcast the truth and everybody just believes it straight away but hey...its an Arnie film.'I told Killian I'd be back.

The tyro medical students, led by a darkly egotistical Sutherland, begin inducing their own deaths to see what awaits once the flatline has been reached. Seems great at first, but as the students push the time limits of being dead still further, what comes into their real worlds is actually not welcome.Pic is never close to being frightening, but the thematics involved are chilling and the big message at its heart is loud and clear.

The bread and butter of Universal in the 30's was classic horror, so this film does well not only as Universal's first film of this type in the talking era, it is just a great film, period. What makes it work so well is William Powell in the starring role. He was at the peak of his acting prowess in 1936, and a master at playing the wily sophisticate. Here he plays Godfrey Smith, a man living in the New York City dump when a couple of wealthy sisters approach him one night and offer him five dollars to accompany them to a scavenger hunt. He quickly rebuffs Cornelia Bullock when she treats him like a broken vase, and sends her packing. However, her sister Irene is genuinely interested in why Godfrey is living in the dump, as though this is a personal choice for the men living here in the depth of the Great Depression, and Godfrey becomes intrigued with her sincerity and the situation in general. Thus, he agrees to accompany Irene and enables her to win first prize and beat her sister. Out of gratitude and a budding romantic interest, Irene offers Godfrey the job of family butler - a job in which nobody seems to last very long, and when you meet the Bullocks at home you find out why. They are truly a self-involved and high maintenance bunch. The mother is a kind soul a bit taken to drink. Cornelia is ever bit the lizard on two legs that she seemed on her and Godfrey's first meeting, and Irene, like her mother, is a kind soul, but taken to episodes of the dramatic. Eugene Palette, with his trademark frog voice, plays the long-suffering Mr. Bullock who spends most of his time paying for the damages caused by the exploits of his idle rich daughters and for the food bill of his wife's artistic protégé Carlo.Godfrey goes the distance as butler, though, navigating touchy situations with the skill of someone who seems to have an intimate knowledge of the world in which the Bullocks live. It soon becomes clear why Godfrey is so patient and wise with his charges, and his own story enables a happy ending for all concerned - for the Bullocks when Mr. Bullock plays the market and loses everything that belongs to him and some that doesn't thanks to a little hopeful embezzling on his part, and also for Godfrey's comrades at the dump when Godfrey is able to find employment for all of them and lift them out of poverty. Of course, the not too subtle yet not heavy-handed message of this Depression era film is that while the idle rich look for ways to occupy their time such as giftless protégés and pointless games, there are real problems that need solving with human lives in the balance.Lombard is great as Irene. Rather than just play the part as a dizzy blonde, she gives the part wit, and strangely enough, manages to give depth to a rather shallow character. Without that wit and depth, Irene would have been just one more inmate in the Bullock asylum, and it would be a real stretch to believe Godfrey would find her interesting. The only thing that seemed a little forced and pat was the ending. Although I could easily believe that Irene was in love with Godfrey, Godfrey seems very formal with Irene and only lets down his facade when he is dealing with her as one deals with a spoiled child when she gets over-dramatic with him. I never felt he was returning her romantic sentiments at all. However, this is a minor criticism in a film with a terrific cast that is one of the great witty comedies of all time.

Nobody around seems to pay attention and you feel a bit at odds with the situation. Are they going to attack me...? you think. And it is not merely Hitchcock's intention but the truly outstanding impact of great piece of cinema.Based on Daphne Du Maurier's story (the author of REBECCA), the film is probably most associated with the Master of Suspense thanks to his splendid rapport with the screenwriter Evan Hunter who adapted the story to the screen. The movie's major strength lies in its flawless storytelling, buildup of tension and study of characters. That makes any viewer emotionally and intellectually involved since everything occurs to be perfectly measured and, yet, surprising. The movie does not display the mainstay themes; there is no McGuffin, there are no explanations, climaxes, explicit references. Nevertheless, it deserves to be called Hitchcock's last unflawed film (David Thomson) where, in Hitchcock's very intention to scare the hell out of people, it still haunts as a threat of unspeakable horror (Bosley Crowther, NYTimes). However, what makes it a movie beyond categories is the fact that it does not aspire to thriller but goes far beyond.If it were not for the credits and the lack of music score (replaced by the sounds of birds that powerfully aid the mood), we would actually assume that we are watching some story that, on the one hand, presents to us captivating characters and, on the other hand, some theme for psychoanalysis. Mitch and Melanie meet in a rather unexpected circumstances at a birds' shop in San Francisco. Just to note that Mr Hitchcock makes his cameo performance quite soon so that we can direct our curiosity towards something else. The action moves to Bodega Bay that supplies the atmosphere with a rather English flair. There, Melanie gets to know people seemingly living together but innerly being quite closed within their angst. Mind you what brings her there to Mitch's house. A gift for his young sister, Cathy (Veronica Cartwright) - two love birds. Crowther nicely defines them as one of nature's most innocent creatures and one of man's most melodious friends. The hidden meaning of this gift, however, works as a 'contrast' for events to come. And the plot would rather develop in a natural human way where love takes over if it were not for the prophets of doom and messengers of terror, the title birds whose noises shade the chirping of the love birds.Indeed, much has been said about such effective depiction of the birds' attacks. Those images are simply 'carved' in your memory and appear to create unforgettable emotions. The incredibly lasting effect predominates thanks to no explanation of why they attack. Xan Brooks in The Guardian accurately points out that the movie provides no answers and no escape. We actually do not know how it all ends. There is no Golden Gate Bridge of San Francisco, no trip of the escaper as it was initially planned, no additional thrills; there is as little as and as much as an image, horrifying, gloomy, and pessimistic where the aggressive intruders from the air take sovereign control over the land, over the world, conclusively. However, the horror depicted in those images, including the victims of the attacks, is merely a miniature of what the film really offers to more cautious viewers, cautious to details and analysis. For if the thrill may become dated as more decades pass, this aspect predominates as essentially timeless.CHARACTERS The rather uncomplicated nature of the plot goes with a truly sophisticated, complex study of the characters. The movie's triumph are the narrative elements which Crowther labeled as clear and naturalistic because that provides extraordinary insight into the personalities portrayed. Melanie is, on the one hand, a typical Hitchcock blonde - beautiful, sophisticated, a woman of appeal you might easily be taken with and, on the other hand, a character of naiveness and freshness; an outsider for others not feeling totally at ease in Bodega Bay. That odd feeling is intensified when she meets the teacher Annie Hayworth (Suzanne Pleshette) and discovers that she used to be Mitch's girlfriend. Mitch delivers certain features of a mama's boy (Hitchcock's fertile theme) but appears to be sympathetic. What emerges as embodiment of angst and fear of loneliness is his mother, Lydia (Jessica Tandy), a character of constant 'presence' and permanent 'distance.' But for any viewer fond of social significance, one scene is a masterwork.The TIDES RESTAURANT scene alone is the sufficient reason for seeing the film. A display of various characters at the face of a problem. The true problem, however, lies in the fact that they either refuse to admit a problem or exaggerate it. There is hardly anyone who would offer us something objective, realistic. There is Mrs Bundy (Ethel Griffies), an ornithologist who embodies skepticism of a scientist and pride of human mind ready to give the answer to anything. She builds all her theses on reason. Although she becomes intellectually involved in the possible assumptions, she does not in the possible solutions.

What can you say about this movie that has not already been said?? Princess Leia in THAT gold bikini, Luke's new lightsabre, A new Death Star, another revelation about Luke's family oh and the controversial Ewok's (I'm pro Ewok, as the rebellion would have failed without them) Once again the story is filled with the standard elements, (love, friendship, over coming your fears and good vs evil) but the movie is anything but standard and it is a lot more enjoyable than the preceding movie. Helped in no small part by the thrilling rescue of Han Solo taking up the first 30 to 40 minutes.I'll get what I didn't like out if the way first. Mark Hamill has ages a lot since the last movie (hardly his fault, but my young son questioned if it was the same actor) and Luke does a lot of waffling and moping about (to go with his new all black wardrobe) and I'm not a fan of Darth Vader saying no before screaming NOOOOO being inserted by Lucas!! Just leave them alone George. It's the longest running of the trilogy (yet it feels shorter than Empire Strikes Back) and could have done with a little bit of trimming. We watch a lot of The Emperor goading Luke on the Death Star, and did we really need the Han Solo jealous of Luke and Leia storyline?? Now that's out of the way.....This is my second favourite of the original trilogy. I loved the rescue of Han at Jabba's Palace, Luke's new green lightsabre, (the only time we seen a green lightsabre until the prequels) Lando, Yoda's scene isn't as sad as it should be, (but that's nit picking) the battle of Endor and the It's a trap attack on the Death Star. Oh all this and I've not mentioned Princess Leia in the gold bikini. The main stuff my early fantasies were based on. I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. Everyone is spot on. Mark Hamill is still excellent as the hero Luke Skywalker (Hamill is not to blame for the problems with his storyline). Harrison Ford is still perfectly cast as the cocky, but at times insecure Han Solo, he is good looking with charisma in spades, whilst Carrie Fisher looks great in THAT gold bikini, and is OK in the action scenes on Endor. David Prowse does what is need of him as Darth Vader, but it's still James Earl Jones who makes Darth Vader.Unfortunately with the exception of Ford, the success of these movies type cast them and despite starting in some interesting movies with a good story and good performances. Sadly these pictures never found audiences as movie goers refused to see him as anything other than their characters here. The score by John Williams is once again another valuable asset to the movie. All in all Star Wars Episode VI Return Of The Jedi is a highly professional piece of work, suspenseful, with a good sense of pace and atmosphere it makes for excellent entertainment and a perfect end to the trilogy.

Mark Hamill has ages a lot since the last movie (hardly his fault, but my young son questioned if it was the same actor) and Luke does a lot of waffling and moping about (to go with his new all black wardrobe) and I'm not a fan of Darth Vader saying no before screaming NOOOOO being inserted by Lucas!! Just leave them alone George. It's the longest running of the trilogy (yet it feels shorter than Empire Strikes Back) and could have done with a little bit of trimming. We watch a lot of The Emperor goading Luke on the Death Star, and did we really need the Han Solo jealous of Luke and Leia storyline?? Now that's out of the way.....This is my second favourite of the original trilogy. I loved the rescue of Han at Jabba's Palace, Luke's new green lightsabre, (the only time we seen a green lightsabre until the prequels) Lando, Yoda's scene isn't as sad as it should be, (but that's nit picking) the battle of Endor and the It's a trap attack on the Death Star. Oh all this and I've not mentioned Princess Leia in the gold bikini. The main stuff my early fantasies were based on. I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. Everyone is spot on. Mark Hamill is still excellent as the hero Luke Skywalker (Hamill is not to blame for the problems with his storyline). Harrison Ford is still perfectly cast as the cocky, but at times insecure Han Solo, he is good looking with charisma in spades, whilst Carrie Fisher looks great in THAT gold bikini, and is OK in the action scenes on Endor. David Prowse does what is need of him as Darth Vader, but it's still James Earl Jones who makes Darth Vader.Unfortunately with the exception of Ford, the success of these movies type cast them and despite starting in some interesting movies with a good story and good performances. Sadly these pictures never found audiences as movie goers refused to see him as anything other than their characters here.

It is the latter that is essential for this movie, for it presumes much of a moral nature that we no longer accept and may even find repulsive. At the beginning of the movie, Dexter and Tracy are a married couple who are fed up with each other and in the act of separating. After Tracy breaks one of Dexter's golf clubs, he pushes her in the face so hard that she falls to the ground. If a man did that to a woman in a modern movie, we would dislike him, but this movie wants us to like Dexter and approve of what he did to Tracy. We are able to get past this scene without too much difficulty, because Tracy is obviously not hurt, and because it is played for laughs.Later, it turns out that the reason she divorced him was that he was an alcoholic, which was all her fault, and that she was wrong to divorce him for that. This point is made seriously, and so it is harder to get past than the push in the face. Can you imagine someone getting up in front of an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting and saying, I am an alcoholic, and it is my wife's fault? Today, we might blame the alcoholic for drinking too much, or we might say his alcoholism is a disease and thus is no one's fault, but blaming the wife is outrageous. Furthermore, we might praise a woman who stays with an alcoholic husband and tries to help cure him, but we do not blame her if she divorces him.When Tracy decides to remarry, Dexter decides that her fiancé George is not the right man for her to marry. Dexter not only crashes the wedding, but he also arranges for a reporter and a photographer, who work for a tabloid, to cover the wedding, in hopes of causing trouble. Many of us have had the experience of disapproving of the person someone is going to marry, but we know it is none of our business, especially if that someone is an ex-wife. Can you imagine being a woman whose ex-husband crashes her wedding trying to break things up? Today, we would regard a man who would do that as odious, and we would advise the woman to get a restraining order on him.Tracy's mother has separated from her father Seth because he was cheating on her, and thus Tracy does not invite him to the wedding. But he shows up anyway. He tells Tracy and his wife that a man's philandering is not his wife's concern. Furthermore, he goes on to say that his adultery is all Tracy's fault (here we go again). He explains that when a man starts getting old, having a sweet, devoted daughter is the mainstay that he needs. But when his daughter does not live up to those expectations, the man just naturally has to go out and get a sweet, devoted young woman to have an affair with. That argument is not only bizarre, it is downright creepy as well. It is hard to believe that even in 1940, when this movie was made, the audience would have bought that line.Although the reporter, Macaulay (Mike), and the photographer, Elizabeth, seem to be romantically involved, he nevertheless begins to fancy Tracy. The night before the wedding, they start smooching and go for a swim. It is all supposed to be innocent, and we are supposed to disapprove of George when he refuses to go through with the wedding. The idea is that since Mike and Tracy did not actually have sex, he is making a big fuss over nothing. But I cannot say that I blame him.Of course, the fact that Tracy is drunk is supposed to excuse her indiscretion. At least her intoxication is an important plot point. But there is way too much drinking in this movie in general. Two-thirds of the movie involves people getting drunk, having a hangover, and then drinking some more as a cure for the hangover. This may be another difference between 1940 and now we do not think drunk-humor is all that funny anymore.After George leaves, Mike asks Tracy to marry him. When she says No, he goes back to Elizabeth, who does not seem to be disturbed by this at all. Except for George, the men in this movie sure get a lot understanding. Tracy, on the other hand, is depicted as being wrong- headed, and is pretty much told so by Dexter, Mike, and Seth, each in his own way. But Tracy is fine just the way she is, and it is the men who are wrong-headed. She would be better off without the lot of them. Instead, she remarries Dexter.

Both did a few well- known things before, but they did not have their feet firmly planted and were still ready to tackle the toughest roles of their careers thus far in the most risqué movie they have done. This is the only X-rated movie to ever win the Oscar for Best Picture. Although it is not rated X anymore, this is not one everybody will be comfortable with, but it is one to see comfort or not. Not only did Voigt and Hoffman nail their parts and give the two best performances of 1969, but the movie itself is one to be treasured for a lifetime. Joe Buck (Voigt) is a naive cowboy from Texas who tries to make it as a hustler in the Big Apple. Buck had been around sex his whole life, and thinks it is the only thing he is good at. There, he meets the severely crippled Erico Ratso Rizzi (Hoffman) who offers to manage him. Ratso dreams of better health and living a happy life in Miami. As both men struggle to survive in the streets and in the world of prostitution, their bond deepens in an unbreakable friendship. Voigt is dazzling as Buck, but is outdone by co-star Hoffman. Hoffman is one of those method actors who live their characters out in their daily lives and show no mercy in what to do to be believable. A common misbelief, method is not that. Method acting is recalling emotional and sense memory. Ratso walks with a limp as he suffers from polio, so Hoffman actually put rocks in his shoe to keep his limp real. Ratso's inner health is also deteriorating and brutally coughs throughout the movie, so Hoffman tried so hard to makes the coughs be believably brutal, that he actually puked in on take. Hoffman's overall health in this film is so bad, some viewers may actually be uncomfortable. Both Hoffman and Voigt give arguably the best performances of their careers.

A film that children can watch no doubt, but which still deals with the themes of loss, sacrifice, the non-existent line between good and evil, war, death and the dying state of divinity and spirituality. It's a heavy movie, yet it's never so excessively dark and brutal that you couldn't show it to a twelve-year- old.For me, this is one of those perfect movies that you have the honour of coming across every once in a while. Because it's really hard to find any faults in this movie.The animation? Superb, mind-blowing, unbelievably beautiful from the very first shot of mountains covered in mist to the last shot of the great forest reaching for the heavens.The music? Haunting, soul-altering, beautiful beyond believe.The characters? Magnificent. Detailed, fluidly animated, easily having more depth than most live-action characters ever created. I also love how this movie has no clear bad guys. The clash between the spirits of the forest and the civilization of man is the central focus of the film, but you very quickly realize that neither of those sides is in the wrong. They both have reasons for their actions, for defending what they see as theirs. The methods of both are at the same time commendable and questionable. Name one other movie where you've seen anything similar. I bet you have to think about it for a while. And yes, if I had to nitpick, I'd say that the single flaw this film has is the fact that the eponymous Princess Mononoke gets almost sidelined from time to time and is not even close to being the most interesting character. But even she is great, it's just that the rest are so much better.Princess Mononoke renews my hope for life every time I see it.
