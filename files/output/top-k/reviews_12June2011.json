Tobe Hooper gets credit for the film but there is wide reports and belief that producer Steven Spielberg did most of the work and I've always felt this was a Spielberg movie and after revisiting the film for the first time in decades I feel even more confident in my opinion. The story is pretty simple as a family finds the house they're living in to be haunted and things take a turn for the worse when the youngest daughter (Heather O'Rourke) gets sucked into some space between the living and the dead. POLTERGEIST is a film that many, many people love and you'll hear many people calling it one of the greatest horror movies ever made. I've never been a huge fan of the film but with this recent viewing I could at least respect it for being that certain type of summer blockbuster that didn't contain much story but it at least went for it all and gave us some dazzling special effects and some nice performances as well. I think that a lot of the summer blockbusters get killed because the special effects take over the story and I think that's this films biggest fault. I've never really seen this as a horror film because it's more of a science-fiction tale or a fantasy and I believe this is where Spielberg's touch is so visible. The ghosts in the film are never scary but instead they're fascinating because of the way the filmmakers show them. We're not seeing them and being frightened but instead we see them in fascinating ways brought out by the effects. You could see the use of the television or in the rather cool way that they can enter through a closet in the bedroom and exit from the ceiling in the living room. There are even more impressive effects including one where an entire room has its belongings floating around in space. These events are never scary but instead you sit there impressed with what they're able to do with the special effects. Everything looks incredibly believable even when compared to the films of today. I often wonder what Hooper would have wanted to do with the material and if he would have wanted it to be much darker. Sure, there are some scenes of violence but I think they're all played rather safe and they never cross that line to where viewers would be turned off. The performances are all extremely effective with the young O'Rourke doing a terrific job as well as JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson as her parents. POLTERGEIST is a good movie but I think it falls well short of being considered a great one or a classic of the genre.

Once again Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke) is their main target but this time she has help from an Indian chief (Will Sampson). No one asked for a sequel to POLTERGEIST but horror fans know that when a film makes money they're going to eventually milk it to death. This first sequel certainly isn't a horrible movie but it doesn't live up to the first film and I can't see how anyone wouldn't be disappointed in the end results. There are two very frustrating things about this film and one is the screenplay. It takes the movie nearly an hour to get going and the entire time you're just sitting there wondering why this screenplay has been turned into a film. It really does feel as if we're watching scenes that really don't add up to anything because the filmmakers weren't sure where they wanted to take the material. Scenes just go on and on for no apparent reason and every once in a while we're treated to some sort of haunting just so the viewer can wake up to everything boring leading up to the haunt. When the film finally kicks into high gear and we get to the actual hunting's and showdown, by then it's simply too late as the viewer has lost all interest in what's going on. The second major problem with the film is the character played by Craig T. Nelson. I'm really not sure what they were trying but there's no question Nelson can be a fine comedy actor and the screenplay makes the poor choice at trying to show off this talent. There are all sorts of comedic bits thrown in and none of them are needed. For one thing they take away from the scare factor but they're also so poorly written that they never once get a laugh. Early on it really seems as if Nelson is in some sort of mad scientist spoof and it really goes against his character and how he was in the first film. Nelson is fine in the role and he's certainly just doing what he's been directed to but it just doesn't work. The performances are the one saving grace here as the original film members (JoBeth Williams, Heather O'Rourke, Oliver Robins) are all in fine form as are supporting players Sampson, Julian Beck and Geraldine Fitzgerald. The film is full of special effects and while they look nice none of them are as effective as what you saw in the first movie. POLTERGEIST II has the reputation of being a horrible movie.

Once again Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke) is their main target but this time she has help from an Indian chief (Will Sampson). No one asked for a sequel to POLTERGEIST but horror fans know that when a film makes money they're going to eventually milk it to death. This first sequel certainly isn't a horrible movie but it doesn't live up to the first film and I can't see how anyone wouldn't be disappointed in the end results. There are two very frustrating things about this film and one is the screenplay. It takes the movie nearly an hour to get going and the entire time you're just sitting there wondering why this screenplay has been turned into a film. It really does feel as if we're watching scenes that really don't add up to anything because the filmmakers weren't sure where they wanted to take the material. Scenes just go on and on for no apparent reason and every once in a while we're treated to some sort of haunting just so the viewer can wake up to everything boring leading up to the haunt. When the film finally kicks into high gear and we get to the actual hunting's and showdown, by then it's simply too late as the viewer has lost all interest in what's going on. The second major problem with the film is the character played by Craig T. Nelson. I'm really not sure what they were trying but there's no question Nelson can be a fine comedy actor and the screenplay makes the poor choice at trying to show off this talent. There are all sorts of comedic bits thrown in and none of them are needed. For one thing they take away from the scare factor but they're also so poorly written that they never once get a laugh. Early on it really seems as if Nelson is in some sort of mad scientist spoof and it really goes against his character and how he was in the first film.

I don't have a problem with sequels that milk the original movies because they're bound to happen due to the lack of any real imagination in the majority of those who call the shot at Hollywood studios. What I do have a problem with is when those sequels turn out as bad as this one and what's worse is that it really looks bad on the previous two films with the story changes that take place here. If you've seen the first two movies then you know the reasons behind the hunting's but this film here tries to change those reasons and make it seem as if it was Carol Anne behind them the entire time. This simply doesn't work because it changes facts from the first two movies but the truth is that very little in the screenplay makes very much sense. It's always trouble when members from the original film don't want to come back so that explains why the family members are now taking care of Carol Anne and it explains why the screenplay has to alter various things here. One example is the silly way they bring back the Zelda Rubinstein character. The way she shows up and communicates with Carol Anne is just downright silly. Even sillier are all the plot devices that try to scare us but never work. Constantly we get rooms either freezing or having a ton of fog machines pumping out smoke. Was this meant to be scary? Were we really suppose to look at a frozen over room and feel terror? For the life of me I couldn't figure out why they had this new apartment building falling apart in a variety of ways because in the end it really didn't add anything. There are long scenes where security or other men are seeing that mirrors are cracked, cameras aren't working or the before mentioned ice but so what? Even worse is an extremely drawn out subplot dealing with Carol Anne's doctor who of course turns out to be no good. Both Skerritt and Allen are very entertaining actors but they can do very little with the screenplay and throughout the film both look confused as to what they're suppose to be doing. Everyone knows what happened to O'Rourke after this movie finished filming but she was good here. Lara Flynn Boyle is also good in her role. If you search out Siskel and Ebert's video review of this film they jokingly talk about how many times Carol Anne is screamed in this movie. This is something most people will pick up on because that name is constantly being said and it seems as if a few seconds don't go by before someone else screams it. According to the trivia section at the IMDb, Carol Anne is said 121 times and you can't help but think this is one reason the running time of 97-minutes isn't a lot shorter.

The same holds true for Michael discovering Nick in a Saigon gambling den where the fictional Russian roulette game takes place. These needle in a haystack coincidences bother me in a picture, even though they often seem necessary for a film to tell it's story.It's interesting to read the reviews of others on this board weighing in on the first hour of the story. For some viewers, nothing of consequence happens at all that has any impact on the picture's conclusion. Actually, I find the setting and interactions of the principal players as important to establishing the feel of small town America of the late Sixties\/early Seventies. Three young men from Clairton, Pennsylvania are about to enter the Army shortly following Steven's wedding day. The men are accorded an understated place of honor at the reception hall where their poster size pictures are prominently displayed. The circle of friends around the principals routinely ponder whether they'll make it back and in what condition. These discussions of patriotism and loyalty exemplify what three decades later a presidential candidate would describe as 'bitter clingers to their guns and religion'.The 'one shot' theme is given prominence during the deer hunt after the wedding, as Michael reinforces for Nick his conviction that a man must prove himself with discipline and finality. That theme is reinforced in the Russian roulette scenarios and most critically, when Michael's frustration leads him to put a gun to Stan's (John Cazale) head in the latter part of the picture. What if, just what if there was a bullet in the chamber when Michael pulled the trigger. The idea that every bullet fired has consequences in setting off a new chain of events is a powerful concept, and reaches it's utter finality when Michael witnesses Nick's death and is unable to prevent it. One could argue that Michael might have been the catalyst for Nick's death by showing up when he did, but here again you have one of those untenable plot points, whereby Nick survives as long as he did by betting the odds against killing himself.Which brings me to one more point, and a major plot hole. Michael gets the clue he needs to locate Nick by visiting Steven at the VA Hospital, where Steven shows him the money that's arriving in the mail from overseas. Yet when Michael encounters Nick in Saigon for the first time, Nick is so shell shocked and drug dazed that he fails to recognize him - 'Michael who?' For me, this begs the question, how would Nick ever have learned where Steven ended up following his release, much less send him his roulette winnings on a regular basis.Still, even with these pitfalls, I find the picture to be a directorial achievement, particularly for being the first Vietnam War film a mere three years following the end of that conflict. Yet the film isn't so much a war picture as it is a story of the human dynamics that are affected by war and it's consequences.

While lacking in the scares and gore of more contemporary entries into the genre, the ideas and themes played out here are smarter than many a modern day science fiction\/horror mash-up. The film is unlikely to make a young audience of today scream with terror but it still manages to muster sympathy for the hopeless story of the victimized monster. Watching the film now conjures memories of many films it has influenced. Sympathetic, misunderstood monsters, crazed arrogant scientists and a screaming damsel in distress all feel overly familiar now but this film would have served up a powerful and original telling of an original tale back in the 1930s. More modern films that spring to mind while watching Frankenstein included '28 Days Later' with its chained monster being provoked by an unsympathetic captor, 'Edward Scissorhands' with its misunderstood protagonist chased out of town by angry villagers\/suburbanites and 'The Terminator' with its unstoppable man-made monster on the rampage (to name just a few!) The influence of this film on contemporary cinema is immeasurable. The less said about recent rip-off 'Splice', the better.The story is tightly structured and the script has its faults but keeps the action rattling along at a brusque pace. The opening scenes of body-snatching are intriguing and followed by some grating scenes of exposition. However this is soon forgotten as the creation of the monster becomes a great set-piece that builds suspense and climaxes with the iconic cry of 'It's Alive!' The supporting cast is lumbered with a fair share of exposition-spouting, theatrically-staged scenes and the tone of the film veers wildly between moments of dread and horror and moments of comic relief with Frankenstein's father but the progression of the narrative is overall logical, well-crafted and fast-paced (particularly for a film of this age).Frederick Kerr plays the Baron Frankenstein with an easy comic touch, mumbling and bumbling like a grumpy but amiable old git. Colin Clive delivers a performance that is far from subtle and contains far too much of the familiar theatrical style of acting from so many classic old movies where the character stares just off camera into the distance when thinking. However the award for really over doing this has to go to Mae Clarke playing Elizabeth whose performance would be ridiculed if it was in a modern film. Karloff plays the monster perfectly, inviting sympathy with his tragic mix of innocence and rage.The actors work well together and despite some overly theatrical thesping, the cast is generally believable and carry the narrative convincingly. Whale never allows the pace to slow and there are some moments of interesting cinematography. However the majority of the camera-work is simple and functional, restricted as they were with the technology of the time. There is a distinct lack of musical soundtrack and this is a blessing as overly powerful orchestral scores can be a distraction in many classics from the thirties.The special effects and set design are also worth mentioning as the interior of the windmill is an iconic construction filled with convincing contraptions that create memorable, iconic moments of the (re)birth of the monster. Karloff's scars and screws add to this to ensure the monster is one of the most enduring and recognizable images of horror cinema.The idea that God must not be challenged and that scientific progress will KILL US ALL is persistent but not forced down throats with quotes from the Bible. The arrogance and madness of the scientist is punished. However the innocence of the monster and the guilt of the aristocratic protagonists are not fully explored. The manipulation of the masses by the aristocrats is touched on but not overtly dealt with as a major theme At barely over an hour long the film is over before anyone could possibly have a chance to get bored of it. In fact the climax feels rushed and could have been more drawn out. More sympathy could have been created for the monster and the connection between creator and creation could have been explored further with a longer third act. Frankenstein is very enjoyable and clearly a hugely influential work in the cinematic horror genre. It is an easy watch even for viewers raised on blood, guts, slashers and torture porn.

While lacking in the scares and gore of more contemporary entries into the genre, the ideas and themes played out here are smarter than many a modern day science fiction\/horror mash-up. The film is unlikely to make a young audience of today scream with terror but it still manages to muster sympathy for the hopeless story of the victimized monster. Watching the film now conjures memories of many films it has influenced. Sympathetic, misunderstood monsters, crazed arrogant scientists and a screaming damsel in distress all feel overly familiar now but this film would have served up a powerful and original telling of an original tale back in the 1930s. More modern films that spring to mind while watching Frankenstein included '28 Days Later' with its chained monster being provoked by an unsympathetic captor, 'Edward Scissorhands' with its misunderstood protagonist chased out of town by angry villagers\/suburbanites and 'The Terminator' with its unstoppable man-made monster on the rampage (to name just a few!) The influence of this film on contemporary cinema is immeasurable. The less said about recent rip-off 'Splice', the better.The story is tightly structured and the script has its faults but keeps the action rattling along at a brusque pace. The opening scenes of body-snatching are intriguing and followed by some grating scenes of exposition. However this is soon forgotten as the creation of the monster becomes a great set-piece that builds suspense and climaxes with the iconic cry of 'It's Alive!' The supporting cast is lumbered with a fair share of exposition-spouting, theatrically-staged scenes and the tone of the film veers wildly between moments of dread and horror and moments of comic relief with Frankenstein's father but the progression of the narrative is overall logical, well-crafted and fast-paced (particularly for a film of this age).Frederick Kerr plays the Baron Frankenstein with an easy comic touch, mumbling and bumbling like a grumpy but amiable old git. Colin Clive delivers a performance that is far from subtle and contains far too much of the familiar theatrical style of acting from so many classic old movies where the character stares just off camera into the distance when thinking. However the award for really over doing this has to go to Mae Clarke playing Elizabeth whose performance would be ridiculed if it was in a modern film. Karloff plays the monster perfectly, inviting sympathy with his tragic mix of innocence and rage.The actors work well together and despite some overly theatrical thesping, the cast is generally believable and carry the narrative convincingly. Whale never allows the pace to slow and there are some moments of interesting cinematography. However the majority of the camera-work is simple and functional, restricted as they were with the technology of the time. There is a distinct lack of musical soundtrack and this is a blessing as overly powerful orchestral scores can be a distraction in many classics from the thirties.The special effects and set design are also worth mentioning as the interior of the windmill is an iconic construction filled with convincing contraptions that create memorable, iconic moments of the (re)birth of the monster. Karloff's scars and screws add to this to ensure the monster is one of the most enduring and recognizable images of horror cinema.The idea that God must not be challenged and that scientific progress will KILL US ALL is persistent but not forced down throats with quotes from the Bible. The arrogance and madness of the scientist is punished. However the innocence of the monster and the guilt of the aristocratic protagonists are not fully explored. The manipulation of the masses by the aristocrats is touched on but not overtly dealt with as a major theme At barely over an hour long the film is over before anyone could possibly have a chance to get bored of it. In fact the climax feels rushed and could have been more drawn out. More sympathy could have been created for the monster and the connection between creator and creation could have been explored further with a longer third act. Frankenstein is very enjoyable and clearly a hugely influential work in the cinematic horror genre. It is an easy watch even for viewers raised on blood, guts, slashers and torture porn. Iconic, sympathetic and deserving of its classic status.

This is an idle moment, an intermission from the killing but not the squalor, composed of words, rain, mud and pregnant pauses between swigs of a shared bottle of grappa. Nothing happens except that the viewer is privy to a communion of souls and the spectacle of what seems like the two most believable actors (Burgess Meredith as Pyle, and Robert Mitchum as Lt. Capt. Bill Walker, respectively)to ever share screen space and time together in the same motion picture.In his famous review of it, James Agee compared the packed emotionalism of GI JOE's final lyrical outburst with the elegiac verses of Whitman's Civil War poetry and while the great author of Let Us Now Praise Famous Men and A Death In The Family was wont to gush about certain pet favs of his (John Huston, the 'Silent Age' of Charles Chaplin, and a documentary approach to the cinema, in general, spring most immediately to mind) on this occasion, when composing the longest essay he ever devoted to a single picture, I believe Agee got it exactly right for of all the war films dealing directly with the miserable business of fighting and dying and soldiering on regardless, only THE DEER HUNTER comes remotely close to equalling its weary blend of stoical honor and boundless remorse in the face of such heartbreaking images of battle.The anecdotal design of THE STORY OF G.I. JOE (the underrated, deceptively original script is by Leopald Atlas and Guy Endure) frustrates as standard narrative mechanism but coheres poetically as a whole, as an ode to the nobility of the human spirit. It ingeniously incorporates surprisingly choice ingredients of the period the overcast quality of Robert Capa's combat photos haunt the cinematography and give this William Wellman film an expressive look (and grace) none of his others possess; the early scenes in the African desert and a hurried-up wedding between a WAAC and enlisted man have the flavor of a series of mordant Bill Maulden cartoons. Most obviously, there are the words of Pyle himself, especially the inspiring ones culled from The Death of Captain Waskow, spoken by Meredith on the soundtrack that conclude the movie.Wellman wraps it together with the utmost tact and unerring sensitivity (qualities not usually associated with him)- with a divine instinct that seems to derive from the beyond. This makes it the greatest of Memorial Day movies. In its stark juxtaposition of brutal inevitability (the men look out for each other like muddy boots dangling in the wind, ready to drop) and the recording of amazingly tender impulses under duress, G.I JOE is the most cathartic of fighting films.

It was very well acted by Temeura Morrison and Rena Owen, both of whom where not well known to me. Not being familiar with the actors prior to this movie made their character (Jake the Muss and Beth Heke,respectively) even more believable as they explore the issue of domestic violence and loss of identity in the movie. Jake was introduced in the movie as someone who has a lot of love and respect for women, but when alcohol becomes involved, his personality changes from a charmer to a wife beater. As Grace (Jake's daughter) says in the movie, people show their true feelings when they are drunk. However, Jake is not completely to blame, his wife, Beth, allowed this violence to happen to her. I guess as an audience to this movie, I will never understand why wives stay with their husbands who beat them up. Is it that the good times weigh more that the bad times no matter what is involved in the bad times? I suppose love is blind, as they say, and it is this kind of love that is dangerous and gets these women in trouble. Some are realized just in time while, for others, it becomes too late. For Beth, it was a mixture of both. While she realized that Jake was still a slave to his fists, his drink, and to himself, she was able to redeem her identity, leaves Jake, and return to her family, who were once warriors. Unfortunately, it was too late as she was not able to save her daughter, Grace, who hung herself after she had been raped by Uncle Bully, Jake's drinking buddy.Grace had a promising future. She found her identity as she wrote her feelings and stories in her journal. It is too bad that she had to die at a very young age, 13, as she would have embodied a better life and education not only for herself but also for the rest of her family.

Robert Rodriguez's first sequel to his popular 2001 escapade Spy Kids sees those titular tots return, and this time they're not only older, whilst arriving with all the bother that comes with that, but they're facing stiff competition from within their own ranks on top of the pressures of having to save the entire world. Has being a secret agent ever been as hard as this? In Spy Kids, those leads were Alexa Vega's Carmen Cortez and Daryl Sabara's Juni; this time, however, they are sharing the titular billing with two newbies another brother\/sister pairing with which the masculine half of the duo, Matt O'Leary's Gary Giggles, is the eldest of the two and his sister Gerti, played by Emily Osment, is the little one in a partnership of binary opposition to that of our leads. Those pesky Giggles appear out to upstage the leads at any given opportunity - when a little girl's plunge to a bloody death is both at stake and perilously close to being a shocking reality during the opening rescue, all of it playing like a condensed episode of Thunderbirds into a six minute window, one really ought not argue with one's co-workers about which of them should take down the girl and which what she had on her person.Life for the Cortez's is good at first, Juni and Carmen are decent at what they do; maintain the respect of their peers whereas father Gregorio (Banderas) is on the cusp of a big promotion. In amidst all of this, it's revealed Juni and Gregorio are loosing touch; you see, Juni has a little insect machine who's able to finish off tying his bow tie now rendering poor dad's presence and ability in this department obsolete. Aside from it being an interesting example of the notion of machinery or technology infiltrating the modern working family unit and pushing kids away from their folks, we wonder if Rodriguez will take the film down a route that'll see them come to understand one another's presence a little more as they undergo hardships before suffering epiphanies post-adventure &#x96; we are not at all surprised when he does exactly that.This adventure kicks off when something called the Transmooker Device, merely a kooky way of stating what it is a chaff accessory capable of electromagnetic pulses, is swiped from under everyone's noses at a Spy Kids gala &#x96; the taking of which is outlined as something resembling a disaster if it fell into the wrong hands. Incredibly, Juni is blamed and is kicked off of the Spy Kids programme, whereas their rivals the Giggles' are hired to effectively clean up Juni's mess and retrieve it - everything is rather glum as a result. Carmen, through her hacking expertise as is established, then manages to get them onto the mission as well, something which brings about not only a trip to a Harryhausen-inspired island full of creatures and wonder, but a redemptive quest for Juni for something he didn't really do.For the most part, it is just a bunch of kids merely running around on an island populated by creatures whose reason for being there becomes clearer much later on. Events are peppered with the potential romance between Gary and Carmen; Gary's belief that the key to her heart is through insulting her brother prominent, something that appears to actually rather turn her on - she does, after all, enjoy a good session of victimisation on poor old Juni. She later admits her feelings to Juni, speaking of her desires to draw Gary out of his flash, egotistical demeanour and into something else - what? we cannot be sure a quieter, softer type perhaps. There's a line from Gary early on about how a spy is only as good as their gadgets, which we hope Rodriguez will address, and he does, to a degree, when the Cortez's gadgetry breaks down upon entry to the island and therefore must use old fashioned logic and so-forth to win through, transcending a message through to little-uns about how you don't necessarily have to rely on electronics and gizmo's for whatever you rely on them for. It is, however, something that gets a little muddled when such a line is used as an encore by a Cortez during a later denouement.Against most odds, the best thing about the film is Steve Buscemi's character, who has all the best lines, including a great theological one about Gods and their bond with what creatures they create.

Sure enough on their first night in their new home, they are forced to flee to the room as three intruders break in to the house, but trouble is is that what the intruders want is in the panic room itself.From the off we know that Panic Room is going to be oozing David Fincher stylishness, the opening credits sprawled across the Manhattan skyscrape like advertising billboards, perfectly set the tone for the movie to follow. I personally think that following on from the harshness and ingenuity of Fight Club, many were surprised at the simplicity of Panic Room's structure, this is after all a straight forward cat and mousery thriller set in one foreboding building. Yet Fincher gains much claustrophobia from such a large building setting, managing to rack up the tension in every reel. Yet the film, in spite of the oppressive nature of the story, never sits still either. The action kicks in from the off and thru a series of devilish stunts, it continues thru to the pulse raising finale.The David Koepp screenplay does not seem dark enough on the first viewing, because some of the interplay between the three intruders is actually jocular, but it never loses sight of its thriller heart. Subsequent revisits to the film reveal it to be a tightly constructed character piece, in what is practically a five character story. The real winner in that department is Jodie Foster's Meg Altman, it would have been easy for the character to be ground out as some super heroine, with death defying feats of courage masking her out as wonder woman, but Fincher has her pure and simply as a resourceful human being, fiercely maternal and strong and intelligent she may be, but at her core she remains fallible, and with that she becomes believable. The other big plus point in the film is Fincher's use of the house, where his camera glides about like a phantom, a ghostly observer to the unfolding proceedings. In and out of locks and coffee pots, up and down stairs, and tracking the movements of the intruders, Fincher isn't showing off, he's putting us the viewer into the mix as well.Cast are very good, Jodie Foster, Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto and a surprisingly potent Dwight Yoakam all come together very well under Fincher's watchful eye, whilst young Kristen Stewart as Sarah puts much emotive heart into a role that could so easily have been too syrupy approaching the final act. Yes it's fair to say that one has to suspend disbelief, this is after all a home invasion thriller following a true course, but in Fincher's hands it rises above cliché to thrive on atmospherics and character dynamics. Well put together and big on ticking time bomb tension, Panic Room gets better on repeat viewings. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 June 2011","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Meg Altman and her daughter Sarah, move into a vast Brownstone home, this place is unique because it has a panic room, a room of safety from where no intruders can gain access. Sure enough on their first night in their new home, they are forced to flee to the room as three intruders break in to the house, but trouble is is that what the intruders want is in the panic room itself.From the off we know that Panic Room is going to be oozing David Fincher stylishness, the opening credits sprawled across the Manhattan skyscrape like advertising billboards, perfectly set the tone for the movie to follow. I personally think that following on from the harshness and ingenuity of Fight Club, many were surprised at the simplicity of Panic Room's structure, this is after all a straight forward cat and mousery thriller set in one foreboding building. Yet Fincher gains much claustrophobia from such a large building setting, managing to rack up the tension in every reel. Yet the film, in spite of the oppressive nature of the story, never sits still either.
