It's such a good name, especially for this genre, but this version has lost most if not all of its effectiveness since its release in 1962. The story is about a girl who manages to survive a car crash, and subsequently cuts herself off from other people, taking a job as an organ player at a church, but just as a way to make money. She begins to have creepy visions of a dead looking man who constantly shows up at strange times, and eventually seems to be following her.While the main character, Candace Hilligoss, is surprisingly attractive, the entire film is full of bad acting and even worse script writing. She meets a guy in the home where she is renting a room, and although he is overly insistent, he is always polite to her. Then when she eventually agrees to go out on a date with him, he almost immediately turns into a complete b*****d. Why would he go to all of that effort to persuade her to spend time with him, and then treat her like crap? The ghostly visions that she has, in particular, have lost all of their effect. Toward the end of the film, not only does she see dozens of these zombies following her, but she also sees herself as one, which hints to the possibility that this movie might have some meaning beyond just a goofy ghost story. However, probably the main reason that this movie isn't scary is that a lot of the scenes weren't edited very well. There's a scene when Mary (Hilligoss) is running from dozens of the zombies, and you can clearly see a huge grin on her face, as if the zombies were a huge group of children who were trying to tickle her.While Carnival of Souls does have a few fairly creepy moments, the film as a whole is a disappointment. The black and white photography is probably one of the best elements of the film, and it does have an interesting soundtrack, but the movie almost entirely lost its impact over the years.And the obscure and confusing ending didn't help much either&#133;  ","genre":null},{"date":"14 March 2001","score":"2 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":"  Carnival of Souls is the kind of title for a movie that really makes you want it to be scary.

Danny DeVito is an excellent casting choice, but his character was unlikable without a single redeeming feature.The plot suffers from attempting to cram too many villians and plot lines into the allotted time.  Splitting the screen time between all three undercuts their stories such that a lot of what happens seems contrived and phony -- except for Catwoman.  Her's is the only villian role that seems to flow naturally, maybe because her goals don't involve grand-scale plans, just the thrill of making mayhem while trying to get the best of Batman. Admittedly, it would be a hard choice as to who to leave out as both villians are created or used by Christopher Walken's character.  My personal opinion is that a wholly different script should have been used, but perserving most of the Catwoman story line or expanding it because she's just so damn good.

The Firm begins to sound very creepy very early in the film, when it becomes known that `the firm' has never had a divorce, `the firm' encourages children,' `the firm' is a big, happy, 41 member family. Unfortunately, it seems that another interesting little side note is that no one has ever left `the firm' and lived. Mitch McDeere (Cruise) is hired by `the firm,' and at first, everything is great. The firm loves him enough to pay back all of his student loans all at once, and he is completely taken in by everything, even down to the way that the firm furnished his new house, in his beautiful new neighborhood (`To make you feel at home. Hope you don't mind.'). The lives of Mitch and his wife Abby (Jeanne Triplehorn) are completely and drastically changed when he is hired by the firm, setting up a disorienting atmosphere, especially when strange things start happening, people getting killed by boat bombs and whatnot. Gary Busey plays a small, seedy role, and it works really well because he's best at playing seedy characters. Ed Harris also delivers a good performance as an FBI agent trying to coerce McDeere into helping them investigate the big bad firm. It seems that McDeere has been helping the firm in its illegal activities, making him guilty without him even knowing about it. If he doesn't help the FBI, he'll go to jail with the other 40 members of that big, happy family. The Firm really gets going once McDeere starts trying to investigate, making copies of incriminating files, etc. Some things may have gone a little too far, like the conveniently placed pillow truck, but as a whole, The Firm is a great thriller. It may not be quite as good as other John Grisham adaptations, The Rainmaker, in particular, but The Firm's complex and fascinating plot, as well as good direction and acting, makes it way above average.

Almost all the storylines headed to a dead-end except the one we were suppose to follow, which makes me ask Why were they in the film at all? Even some of the characters were nothing more than props. Where did the boy disappear too halfway through the movie?This movie was emotionally gripping, but the director did not have enough respect  for the audience not to make it subtle and could not developed the character without making her into a martyr.I feel that this film falls too much into the category of not-a-typical-Hollywood movie which will bring many people to its defense, but all in all it ends up being just as the films we are suppose to juxtapose it to.It is an interesting experiment worth seeing, but not one for the textbook.

Unfortunately, he is the best reason to go see the movie.People have commented that the plot of the movie is Taratino-esque.

Part of the problem is that the ads prepare you to see a comedy.  It wasn't even a dark comedy -- which would have been greatly interesting given Julia Roberts' track record.The basic plot  Jerry (Pitt) has to retrieve a gun, terribly named The Mexican, for some LA-esque hoodlums.  Unfortunately, this retrival exercise strains Pitt's and Roberts relationship, b\/c Jerry is suppose to go at the same time as their plan to go to Las Vegas.  Jerry has problems retrieving the gun b\/c of its accursed nature, so Jerry's gang hires a thug to kidnap Roberts in an effort to persuade Jerry into retrieving the valuable gun, rather than take it for himself.Major Problems  The kidnapping is nothing more than a futile excuse to add some lines and give some comedy to Julia Roberts' role, and to more humanize the kidnapper\/kidnappee relationship.  Jerry has always been loyal.  In fact, Jerry's best friend in the outfit has been even more loyal.

This is a good theme to explore and will never tire of discussion.  Unfortunately, this movie flat out misses this point, at best lightly skirting around the point (Pitt and Roberts' relationship; Winston's sexuality; the stories behind the gun) to try to play to silly visual humor and poorly times one-liners.

We worship cars and movie stars and so these thing get combined in a sort of bizarre foreplay and sexual deviance.Nicks, dents, gashes all become parts of a cars flesh. It takes on an emotional identity to the characters. They treat the cars as if they were extensions of themselves and in fact the metal and chrome of the cars does start to become part of some the characters in a backwards way(rosanna). She is part machine. This movie to me is a metaphor for longing. It examines in an extreme way our desire to be filled and not feel so empty inside. The people in this movie live in a deeply religious state and are even willing to die for it. They want to die for it in fact. They want salvation. The people in this movie are consumed with the longing for salvation from their empty lives and the fear its not there at all.The question people ask alot is why are they so empty? why don't they join a church or something? I think the people in this movie already have gone that route and found it lacking to say the least. I think this movie is far bleaker than most reviews i read so far. I think it is saying. we are headed for the big meltdown. We are driven by desire than cannot be fulfilled. The end result is desire and faith turned into violent obsesion and sorrow without end. A Disapointment so big that it drives you to death. By the way im not this bleak but i thought the movie was. And yes i did like it alot )  ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"14 March 2001","score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":"  Tombstone overshadows its much heralded counterpart, Wyatt Earp in many many ways.

For two prime examples of both phenomena, (see also Star Wars Episode 1) we have 'The Blair Witch Project' and 'Book of Shadows Blair Witch 2'.

Who the hell put Heather's footage at the foundation, anyway? I remember sitting in the theater watching the last 5-10 minutes of 'TBWP' and feeling like my fiercely pounding heart was pumping icicles through my bloodstream. I flinch at a jump scene like everyone else and grimace at gore, but sitting in a theater, surrounded by friends, I felt for the first and last time *real, creeping fear* when I myself was not in danger. Of course, shortly thereafter, the media couldn't stop yapping about a movie that had been talked about for months in the independent film industry.

The point of all this rambling about 'TBWP' in a review ostensibly for its sort-of sequel is necessary, as the one aspect of this second film *is* the reaction to the first- and it is also necessary to look at the aftermath of the original movie to understand reactions to this one. At the end you still 'don't know' what happened.  'BW2' is not as scary, funny, believable or innovative as the original. It's got nudity, sex and tons of blood, none of which the original stooped to- although the blood-letting flashbacks were put in at the studio's insistence. The performances- though not groan-worthy- are not as good, some of the characters not as interesting. Erica and Kim- who bears a middling resemblance to Rose McGowan- are both gorgeous, and they are at least fairly interesting. Jeff comes off as useless, but you can understand his position, and the 'normal couple' is simply boring. 4 of these actors- all except Erica- have worked before, although for one- Stephen- this was a first movie role. All are relative unknowns, but most of them have parts in upcoming flicks, and any talk of their careers ending here is just malicious b.s. on the part of the anti-bandwagoneers. Any assertion that the box-office failure of 'BW2' shows that most people hated the first after being 'tricked' by the hype into seeing it is strictly inaccurate- I didn't see it in the theaters, not because I hated the first but because I didn't have time and I was sick of the *hype* itself.

Most of the actors in Get Carter have the ability to far outshine this genre, much the way the actors in 1998's Ronin did-within the context of the plot, the cast of Ronin delivered their lines with utter conviction.Not necessarily so here. Those stars in Get Carter who have real talent weren't used enough, and those who don't have the strongest dramatic chops were given boatloads of screen time. Sly is wooden at times (as per usual), but has some fine moments.Miranda Richardson, as Carter's widowed sister-in-law, is solid, but underutilized. Mickey Rourke, as an internet porn purveyor, has obviously been working out some more, but it's still apparent that he peaked in Diner. The big surprise was just how much actual characterization they allowed Rachael Leigh Cook--as Carter's bereaved niece--to show off. Any one of these actors, given enough on-screen opportunity, might have saved Get Carter from its ridiculous plot holes and incongruities. But they didn't. Do yourself a favor avoid this film.
