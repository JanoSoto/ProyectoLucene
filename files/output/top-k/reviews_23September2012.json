And while it does accomplish both of these goals quite well, at heart, the movie is more of a screwball love triangle. In the center, there's Lois Lane the feisty, go-getter reporter who spells 'rapist' with two Ps. On opposite sides of her are the titular character&#x97;a flying hero from the long-deceased planet Krypton&#x97;and her skittish coworker Clark Kent. The only catch is that the latter is merely the alter-ego of the former, who deftly plays both parts back-to-back around her, and the criminals of Metropolis.This love story is certainly the most interesting element in Superman. So interesting that I wish the lengthy climax of the picture&#x97;which involves nuclear weapons, an earthquake, a dam collapsing, and the most bizarre form of time travel that I've seen&#x97;had been trimmed to allow a little more room for it. As either Superman or Clark Kent, the late Christopher Reeve is immediately affable handsome, well-fit, and full of uncanny energy. He's oddly enough most impressive as Clark Kent. The reason, I think, is that many actors can play a tough-as-nails deadpan hero personae. Yes, Mr. Reeve plays its well here, but it's not exactly a new role. As Clark Kent, he hits every nail on the head, coming across as likably pathetic and clumsy without succumbing into pretentious play-acting. Margot Kidder&#x97;sexy and seldom with a changing expression&#x97;is right for the role of Lois Lane. Whenever these two are on screen, the picture comes alive, and the screenplay gives them just the right banter to develop and interesting chemistry. So it's no surprise that the best part of the picture is when the two characters take an evening flight over the clouds.As for the rest of the movie, it's delightfully entertaining. The screenplay has a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor that only occasionally overplays its hand Superman has a few too many comments as he saves somebody. Such as when he saves a reporter from a collapsing dam, he mutters some snappy comment that not only seems pointless but is hardly audible over the roars of the newly born waterfalls. Where the humor comes into great play&#x97;and what I really enjoyed next to the love story&#x97;were the villains. There are three of them. The leader is Lex Luthor, brilliantly acted by Gene Hackman. There's also Valerie Perrine and Ned Beatty as his somewhat clumsy subordinates. And although these three conjure up a plan that threatens half of California, they are essentially just a bunch of numbskulls who can hardly get through a scene without Mr. Hackman deriding one of them. Mr. Beatty in particular. A scene where they discuss their plans to get Superman out of the picture based on what they read in the newspaper is a real gem!As a technical achievement, Superman runs hot and cold. When it's in outer space (showing us another planet, exploding stars, and waves of dust reminiscent of the Star Gate sequence from Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey) it's brilliant. Even though the opening titles, with each credit being born out of zapping bolts of blue light, run for a long time, it's hardly a bother since graphically they're so dazzling. When it's on earth, however, there are some weaknesses. The methods by which Christopher Reeve simulates flying (many of which are done without processed shots) are stunning smooth, graceful, and seamless. However, the processed shots are not as impressive, as the backgrounds become noticeably darker and grainier. There are also a couple of sped-up shots, most of them when Superman changes disguises, that have an unfinished feeling to them.John Williams' music is, as we would expect, ear-warming and memorable. The other person I do want to give special mention to is Richard Donner, the director, for treating this material with a certain style&#x97;like an epic. Most superhero pictures are shot like a comic strip, which each shot in close-up and bounding between characters. Here, Mr. Donner gives every scene a complimentary extreme wide-angle, showing us sweeping landscapes, wide angles of cities, and Lex Luthor's luxurious underground chamber. Even dramatic scenes are shot from a distance a bold move at any point in cinema history. Sometimes he does lose his head, using a few too many dissolves between shots when they are not necessary, but for the most part, his approach is appreciatively adventurous.At two and a half hours, Superman maintains a gleeful pleasantness. It is never boring, except in its needlessly expanded version, which adds too much padding and wears out even some of the original cut's good stuff. But it really is a testament to how important actors and actresses can be to a film. After all, even though Superman is loaded with special effects&#x97;some of which, again, are dazzling&#x97;it's the cast who triumphs. Mr. Reeve, Miss Kidder, Mr. Hackman, Mr. Beatty, Miss Perrine, Jackie Cooper, Marlon Brando, Glenn Ford (what an inspired choice putting this underrated actor known for more plausible tales in a superhero movie!) and the others are so insistently good that they make Superman the innocent, easygoing 151 minutes that it is.

A few minutes later, it did and I looked at the positive reviews on Rottentomatoes before I became shocked at the reception it had. I was like, A 97%? WOW! No wonder so many people like it and I apparently agreed with the audience who watched this movie when it first came out that it's one of the best ones out there next to Titanic, The Lord of the Rings, and Batman.The story is quite simple as an adaptation About a dying tribe called the Mohicans in which only two are left as well as one adopted white man named Hawkeye. These three men refuse to enter the militia for Britain in 1757 for they want freedom. On their way to Kentucky, they intercept Indians attacking a small regiment of British including the two daughters of an British Colonel named Edmund Munroe and Cora and Alice, on their way to a fort. As the three men lead the survivors to the fort, the two love stories take place, but the French and Indian War continues.Like I said before, I haven't read the book yet, but the story in this movie, although sprawling, is a much more compelling one with some subtly and quiet moments and the love story between the two main characters is also compelling as well. The pacing moves under two hours and didn't manage to bore me at all. The scenery is breathtaking with beautiful mountains and rivers and the cinematography is magnificent. The strongest aspects goes to three more things aside from Michael Mann's solid direction.First, there's the acting and in terms of cinema, it's excellent here. Daniel Day-Lewis is excellent as the main role, Russell Means did great as Hawkeye's father, Maurice Roves did great as Colonel Edmund and Madeleine Stowe did great as the love interest for Hawkeye along with a malevolent performance from Wes Studi. Second, there's the action sequences and boy were they great. I liked every single part of them especially the ones with the Indians and the British troops, but the strongest aspect of the action is the climax with an emotional feel to it. And third, but not the least, is the music from Trevor Jones. It gives the movie a sweeping and epic feel and scope and is one of his best music scores in a film since The Dark Crystal.Overall, I do agree that it's one of the best movies ever made and even though I never read the book (which I will someday), this would always be recommended to every single movie lover out there like most movies are.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"23 September 2012","score":"","review":" With this entry in the Death Wish franchise, gone is the grim tone of the first two movies, to be replaced by a much more extravagant, over the top tone; in fact, this cheerfully ridiculous movie borders on parody, what with its glorious excesses and depictions of a stylized, scummy urban Hell. Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) has supposedly left his vigilante days behind, but we all know that ain't gonna last. He returns to NYC to visit an old friend, only to find the friend about to expire. He's erroneously arrested for the friends' murder, only to be recruited by police detective Richard Shriker (the great character actor Ed Lauter, in the last of the four movies that he did with Bronson) to do the vigilante thing anyway as Shriker's police force can't handle the gang violence problem on their own. Kersey displays some real ingenuity in this one, ordering his extremely impressive arsenal through the mail (a man named Wildey really deserves to take a bow here) and also going to the trouble of setting up booby traps. Director Michael Winner returns to the franchise yet again, also editing under his pseudonym Arnold Crust, and keeps thing delightfully cheesy and silly, very well paced, and action packed. The dialogue is full of some absolute gems (They killed The Giggler, man!; Chicken's good. I like chicken.; What am I gonna do with you, dude?; My shop! My shop!). Things blow up REAL good, and here and there are little trashy details like a potential rape victim flashing her breasts for all of us to see. The supporting cast does what they can, although truth be told, the public defender character played by Deborah Raffin (who'd acted for Winner in The Sentinel (1977)) coming off as a rather weak love interest, and Raffin and Bronson don't really get any chemistry going. Lauter makes up for that with his own high level of awesomeness, even working side by side with Bronson during the climactic action. Martin Balsam is pretty good as an angry resident, and in small parts fans can see the likes of Bill S. Preston, Esquire (a.k.a. actor Alex Winter) as a thug, Marina Sirtis (Troi from 'Star Trek The Next Generation) as a victim, and Ricco Ross (Frost in Aliens) as The Cuban. Kirk Taylor is fairly memorable in the role of creepy gang member The Giggler, who laughs while he runs. Death Wish 3 also proves the adage that often movies like this are only as good as their villains, as actor Gavan O'Herlihy (son of Dan O'Herlihy) leaves a big impression as sneering gang leader Fraker, reverse mohawk and all. The music (once again credited to rock legend Jimmy Page) isn't as effective and experimental as the one for Death Wish II. Outlandish but never boring, the movie is escapism supreme, and shows our star in fine form, ridding the world of scum as only he can. Eight out of 10.

He's erroneously arrested for the friends' murder, only to be recruited by police detective Richard Shriker (the great character actor Ed Lauter, in the last of the four movies that he did with Bronson) to do the vigilante thing anyway as Shriker's police force can't handle the gang violence problem on their own. Kersey displays some real ingenuity in this one, ordering his extremely impressive arsenal through the mail (a man named Wildey really deserves to take a bow here) and also going to the trouble of setting up booby traps. Director Michael Winner returns to the franchise yet again, also editing under his pseudonym Arnold Crust, and keeps thing delightfully cheesy and silly, very well paced, and action packed. The dialogue is full of some absolute gems (They killed The Giggler, man!; Chicken's good. I like chicken.; What am I gonna do with you, dude?; My shop! My shop!). Things blow up REAL good, and here and there are little trashy details like a potential rape victim flashing her breasts for all of us to see. The supporting cast does what they can, although truth be told, the public defender character played by Deborah Raffin (who'd acted for Winner in The Sentinel (1977)) coming off as a rather weak love interest, and Raffin and Bronson don't really get any chemistry going. Lauter makes up for that with his own high level of awesomeness, even working side by side with Bronson during the climactic action. Martin Balsam is pretty good as an angry resident, and in small parts fans can see the likes of Bill S. Preston, Esquire (a.k.a. actor Alex Winter) as a thug, Marina Sirtis (Troi from 'Star Trek The Next Generation) as a victim, and Ricco Ross (Frost in Aliens) as The Cuban. Kirk Taylor is fairly memorable in the role of creepy gang member The Giggler, who laughs while he runs. Death Wish 3 also proves the adage that often movies like this are only as good as their villains, as actor Gavan O'Herlihy (son of Dan O'Herlihy) leaves a big impression as sneering gang leader Fraker, reverse mohawk and all. The music (once again credited to rock legend Jimmy Page) isn't as effective and experimental as the one for Death Wish II. Outlandish but never boring, the movie is escapism supreme, and shows our star in fine form, ridding the world of scum as only he can. Eight out of 10.

Well, Last night I watched a movie which has most un-believable rating on world's most trusted movie rating site, IMDb with a rating of 9.3 by more than 800,000 votes (yes!). I's indeed very overwhelmed & enthusiastic about the movie.(you know, that much publicity takes the excitement to the extreme level) Now, talking about the movie, it is a story of a man who gets life imprisonment sentence for a crime which he didn't commit. Here it remembers me about the classical Russian novella named 'The Kreutzer Sonata' by Leo Tolstoy. It seems to me a bit inspired from that. Indeed. The rest of the story line is different. It specifically a story of a man's struggle (in which he got succeed) to come out of the prison (by hook or crook, take it your own way) and proved himself innocent after the hard sufferings of 19 years imprisonment. The whole story tells about the moral to heed i.e. Hopes Never Die. I really can keep this movie on my All-time favorite movies list. It deserves so, Btw. This is some of among those movies in which I didn't check the duration even a single time. And, during the whole movie I was just sitting on the edge of my chair with wide open my eyes & my mind (off course). And, for now, with classiness of this movie in my brains & off course terrible sleep in my eyes, I'm no more in situation to write anything else. But one thing I'd make sure that very soon I'm gonna read 'Stephen King'. And, At the last I'd like to halt my review by one of the dialogues of the movie, Which I liked a lot, Get busy living or get busy dying. And, I'm really nowhere an obtuse to just review it like a blind-head Ass. Lol ) Remember Hope is a good thing.
