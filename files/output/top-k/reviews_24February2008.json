That is how I would describe Schindler's List in a few words. Schindler's List is based on the real life story of Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson). Of course when we think of a film based on a real life we usually think that it is just a ploy to gain people's attention, but this film really does bring real events back to us such as the horrors of the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz and the how people like Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) would indiscriminately kill men, women and children just because they are Jews. Steven Spielberg came at this film with the right respect and didn't even receive a salary to direct citing that it would be 'blood money'. He choose to make it as realistic as possible not leaving out a single crying child, a single drop of blood or a single horror anywhere. Many parts of this film are difficult to watch, but if they weren't then this film wouldn't be a masterpiece. Don't get me wrong though, this is not an action film but more of a thriller. To say that the music 'fits' into this film would be a crime. John Williams's scores don't fit the film but make the film. If you wanted to get an Oscar in a film you had made then all you would have to do is get Williams to do the music for you, it wouldn't matter how bad the film was his music would make it come to life. Also there is a mix of both diegetic and non-diegetic music like when the Krakow ghetto is being liquidated a sad monotonous Jewish song is being sang by children which is clearly non-diegetic as no singing could take place in the confusion and death of the ghetto and also shows what a horror the Nazis were committing. The music then stops for a while as the Nazis wait for the Jews in hiding to come out and as the shooting starts a piece of diegetic music also starts which is in total contradiction to what is happening as it is jolly and 'bouncy'. The piece of music is by Beethoven and is being played by a German soldier trying to escape the real world where all the death is happening. The direction is genius to say the least. This film shows just how good Spielberg can be when he wants to be. It creates a very dark subtle humour which messes with your emotions. Such as, going back to the liquidation scene, when the Nazis soldiers are searching for hidden Jews and they shine a light round the room and it reveals a cluster of them and they all raise their hands which brings a smile to your mouth until you realise in horror that those Jews would die and you had found it funny. He also builds expectations that make you think one thing is going to happen and then he makes another thing happen instead. An example of this is the day when Goeth tries to take Schindler's advice on power is when you have every right to kill but don't. The first thing that happens is that Goeth saddle is on the floor and you expect him to shot the guy looking after the horse but he doesn't. After he comes back from horse riding, the Jew who is supposed to be cleaning his bath reports that it couldn't be cleaned. Now you think he won't kill him because he's on a good day and at first the film goes along with that but then as the Jew is walking away a bullet hits the ground at his feet. This makes you think that he is going to kill him but then he misses again and you think he is just playing with him changing your emotions again, and the final bullet hits him in the back of the head killing him instantly. Fiennes plays Goeth beautifully here and in the rest of the film but in this particular scene he makes the warped personality come out extremely well in because Goeth had no reason to kill the Jew and had just 'pardoned' him and yet after he touches the mirror and his nail gets chipped which makes him kill the Jew. Spielberg also gets an excellent performance out of Liam Neeson portraying him as the bad guy in the beginning before bringing in Goeth who is a character so bad he makes anyone look good. This is Neeson's greatest performance by far. Spielberg also uses the popular genre of Neeson's characters as a mentor to great effect getting him to comfort the Jews with opaque realism and develop his own character into someone we can emphasize with and makes us think what we would do in the same situation. The script is an amazing piece of work. The plot doesn't lose a single second of interest in it's over 3 hour running time. This is a feat in itself but then it doesn't just keep your interest but holds itself in your memory forever. Whenever you see that it is being shown on TV you plan to watch it days before it's on and then make sure nothing will interrupt you in that entire time. Each time you watch it you find something you didn't notice before and you can never watch it to many times. The script paints the background of the Victoria Falls in a master piece and leaves the foreground for Spielberg to paint the butterfly. Perfection is not something that easily comes to humans and is something only really found in the night's sky, the largest rainforests and the deepest oceans. It eludes us like a frightened cat and speeds past us like a rocket. This film has not achieved perfection but as the spice train past by it grabbed a handful of perfect and is seasoned all over with it.

There are a lot of people after Lecter in this movie. The first and foremost is the FBI (mainly Clarice Starling). Also we have a rival of Lecter's, a victim who survived his torture named Mason Verger (Gary Oldman). We also have an agency in Italy after him, mainly Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini). Even Starling has a rival, Agent Paul Krendler(Ray Liotta). Everyone is well played and the kills are unique. Lecter really does a good job in this film of being evil yet being a protagonist. I recommend this to fans of the first who are open-minded enough to give this a chance. If you have an open mind you will enjoy this as much as if not more than the first.

In the annals of great events of the twentieth century, the quiz show scandals of the late fifties would rank pretty low even then, and less so today. Why? I'm not sure. Perhaps because so many entertainments today are blatantly phony, it's hard to get very worked up about a rigged TV program from fifty years ago. Pro wrestling is the obvious example, but there is the whole phenomenon of 'reality' television that, while perhaps not technically 'rigged,' is so overblown in its self-importance as to feel unnervingly fake to most discerning people. But then, that shouldn't really matter, should it? Movies don't have to be about big subjects. Certainly some of the very best have been about small or intimate themes. And 'Quiz Show' does a good job of telling its story, large, small or in-between. It has a nice feel of time and place, though it doesn't portray the fifties as convincingly as some other films have. I think this has more to do with the dialogue than set decorations or any other visual element.

Charles Van Doren's father, who was a rather famous professor and intellectual in his own right, considers the programs hardly worthy of contempt, and that cheating on them was roughly equivalent to plagiarizing comic books.

I just love Anderson's style, that works in the same perfect way to all of his films, with all the strange characters, the beautiful colors, the titles of the things and all of those things that when you watch them you will know that is a Wes Anderson film. In this film, i love the character of Max who is a genius for all the extracurricular activities but nothing is appreciate by the Rushmore Academy. I love too how Max has every little thing under control until he feel love for the first time, his behavior suddenly change when he most compete with Herman but actually he is competing for a lady that can't love him because he is only 15 and the lady is a teacher. In the end Max returns to his regular behavior, having again Dirk Calloway (Mason Gamble) as a friend and accepting Margaret Yang (Sara Tanaka), a girl of his same age who meet him in Grover Cleveland High after Max was expelled from Rushmore, as her girlfriend. Because after all, he and Herman did all those crazy things just for a lady that was their Rushmore.The cast is perfect; with Jason Schwarztman in his very first role making a memorable character, Bill Murray in the beginning of his new career in which he seem that is not acting, he is just always with the same expression making that his character looks boring of life. He is just terrific for those type of characters. And with the lovely Olivia Williams making a great performance as the love desire of Max and Herman.

(For comparison, he gave that same rating to mediocre movies like Six Days, Seven Nights and Superman III.) The reasoning he gave for giving Home Alone that rating was that he liked the first half of the movie, but then didn't like the burglar\/booby traps plot in the second half. At first, I was going to say that Roger Ebert has simply lost touch with his inner child, but I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt.I watched Home Alone today after many years and I still loved it and I still laughed, even though I had practically memorized the movie as a kid and still remembered it all. As a kid, I remember always wanting to get to the cool stuff when watching this movie, the parts about pulling pranks on the pizza man or booby-trapping the house. I'd fast-forward through much of the first half (even though I liked it). This time around, I had a new-found appreciation for the beginning half, where we get to see how an 8-year-old copes with waking up and discovering that his family has disappeared. I still LOVE the second half of the movie, but I saw the first half in a new light this time.I think the reason why that happened is the same reason why Roger Ebert didn't like the second half of the movie. As an adult, one watches family movies to remember what it was like to be a kid, to remember the dreams of being grown-up and independent and the silly little fears of things in the basement. That's what the first half of the movie offers and it works for both kids and adults; kids relate to it and adults reminisce about it.The second half is for the kids (and for the inner child). Sure, it's pretty outrageous to see an 8-year-old devise clever booby-traps that work like clockwork and are encountered in precisely the right order. Ebert says that our little hero gets too smart and doesn't have the budget for his fancy booby-trapping. Maybe, but that's not the point. Adults watch and say, Man, this can never happen. But kids say, Man! I wish I could do that! It is, after all, one reason why we go to the movies to see things that can only happen in the movies. As a kid, words could not describe how awesome it was to see an 8-year-old take on two adult burglars and pummel them (especially after one of the burglars had the nerve to say, Kids are stupid). It is a child's fantasy come true.That is why this movie was so popular when it came out, why it stayed #1 at the box office for 12 straight weeks. It's also why every family movie from the 1990's tried (and failed) to imitate it. Kids love it because it's a dream come true and parents love it because it's a dream remembered.(By the way, parents, I should warn you that kids will want to try and imitate our little hero and, unless you want your house booby-trapped, I'd advise that you let them know not to do that. Also, there's one scene where our hero celebrates his new-found freedom by watching a gangster movie, where he sees one gangster blow another one away with a tommy gun, a scene that scares him and makes him remember his mom. Older kids and adults will laugh at the scene (because it's way over the top), but little kids may actually get scared. Just a caution.)Macauly Culkin is great as our hero, Kevin. He was a pretty talented child star and it's too bad his career never really went anywhere. Our two burglars are Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci, who are the Pinky and The Brain of breaking and entering.

(For comparison, he gave that same rating to mediocre movies like Six Days, Seven Nights and Superman III.) The reasoning he gave for giving Home Alone that rating was that he liked the first half of the movie, but then didn't like the burglar\/booby traps plot in the second half. At first, I was going to say that Roger Ebert has simply lost touch with his inner child, but I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt.I watched Home Alone today after many years and I still loved it and I still laughed, even though I had practically memorized the movie as a kid and still remembered it all. As a kid, I remember always wanting to get to the cool stuff when watching this movie, the parts about pulling pranks on the pizza man or booby-trapping the house. I'd fast-forward through much of the first half (even though I liked it). This time around, I had a new-found appreciation for the beginning half, where we get to see how an 8-year-old copes with waking up and discovering that his family has disappeared. I still LOVE the second half of the movie, but I saw the first half in a new light this time.I think the reason why that happened is the same reason why Roger Ebert didn't like the second half of the movie. As an adult, one watches family movies to remember what it was like to be a kid, to remember the dreams of being grown-up and independent and the silly little fears of things in the basement. That's what the first half of the movie offers and it works for both kids and adults; kids relate to it and adults reminisce about it.The second half is for the kids (and for the inner child). Sure, it's pretty outrageous to see an 8-year-old devise clever booby-traps that work like clockwork and are encountered in precisely the right order. Ebert says that our little hero gets too smart and doesn't have the budget for his fancy booby-trapping. Maybe, but that's not the point. Adults watch and say, Man, this can never happen. But kids say, Man! I wish I could do that! It is, after all, one reason why we go to the movies to see things that can only happen in the movies. As a kid, words could not describe how awesome it was to see an 8-year-old take on two adult burglars and pummel them (especially after one of the burglars had the nerve to say, Kids are stupid). It is a child's fantasy come true.That is why this movie was so popular when it came out, why it stayed #1 at the box office for 12 straight weeks. It's also why every family movie from the 1990's tried (and failed) to imitate it. Kids love it because it's a dream come true and parents love it because it's a dream remembered.(By the way, parents, I should warn you that kids will want to try and imitate our little hero and, unless you want your house booby-trapped, I'd advise that you let them know not to do that. Also, there's one scene where our hero celebrates his new-found freedom by watching a gangster movie, where he sees one gangster blow another one away with a tommy gun, a scene that scares him and makes him remember his mom. Older kids and adults will laugh at the scene (because it's way over the top), but little kids may actually get scared. Just a caution.)Macauly Culkin is great as our hero, Kevin. He was a pretty talented child star and it's too bad his career never really went anywhere. Our two burglars are Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci, who are the Pinky and The Brain of breaking and entering.

The Jerk is a film that would have its title actually describe its protagonist rather than be named after him; it's a film that concedes to silly logic and resorts to low brow humour to get across some of its jokes and yet when it works, the result is actually rather amusing.I've seen a handful of Steve Martin films before this but none of them really stand out in memory except for perhaps John Hughes' 1987 hit Planes, Trains & Automobiles and yet Martin played it deadly serious in the particular film. Here, Martin plays a character who has grown up in poverty named Navin Johnson, a person so immature and oblivious to life and the facts of life that it is pushed to the point of hilariously funny and yet completely unbelievable at the same time. At its core, The Jerk is a play on the American Dream but that is just touching the surface. I am not afraid to make the statement that I believe Navin to be particularly below a level of normality, in fact I believe him to be 'special'. But this is not your comedy mixed in with American Dream type tale with the village idiot telling the story that Forrest Gump so memorably was, this is something else.As a character, Navin is stupid and yet a genius at the same time; he just doesn't seem to know it. Much like Hoffman's character in Rain Man, he can do unbelievable things of an intelligence unbeknown to us yet is able to come across as pretty simple in the process. Much like Steinbeck's novel Of Mice and Men in which it pitches a supposed message that the American Dream is an impossible achievement that no matter who you are, will no doubt end in a lot of hard work and ultimately, tragedy; The Jerk, I feel, puts across a pitch that the American Dream and America as a whole is the only country in which someone like Navin could succeed in &#150; this again reminds me of a more modern reference, namely an episode from The Simpsons in which a character called Frank Grimes tells Homer he is what's wrong with America and that if he lived in any other country, he'd have died long ago. Whilst this may be a little too political for a Simpsons episode, the notion that anybody can achieve anything in the 'land of opportunity' is very much present in The Jerk with Navin, the village idiot, achieving greatness in the form of his very own beautiful wife, large bank balance and Scarface-like mansion.The Jerk is a film that relies on dumb humour and clever ad-libs, as well as plays on words. Sometimes it works, other times it doesn't the scene in which the hillbilly serial killer who picks a random name from the phone book for assassination is utterly ridiculous, as is the idea that no one notices a guy in broad daylight, in plain view with a massive sniper rifle; the consequent shootout at the garage could well have been played out to the Benny Hill soundtrack as Navin dodges bullets and inspects leaking oil cans. But then again, since Navin is this sort of Raymond Babbitt character from Rain Man, he is able to invent a way of keeping glasses from falling off whilst retaining that notion that he is of an autistic nature. Along with this, the script is good fun and Martin is given some good lines but this is whjere the ad-lib idea enters the fray St. Louis? No, Navin Johnson. Is probably the best of the selection but there are a few other one liners that enforce chuckles.I think The Jerk appeals to the majority because the audience are given a position of power, ie; they know what the repercussions of certain situations will be even if the wildly immature Navin doesn't. When a group of Hispanic gangsters pull up at the garage and use a credit card that obviously isn't theirs, we as the audience immediately recognise the danger and the threat but Navin carries on like they are upstanding members of society. This means that, since we already know the film falls into the comedy genre, we have the position of power that the hero doesn't thus rendering the events that follow 'funny'; because we expect him to get a pretty harsh lesson in life following the blatant identification with apparent danger. The exact same situation and audience relation is played out at the carnival, in the caravan when Navin spends time with a woman for the first time he is unsuspecting but through costume, we have identified what sort of a woman this is; boots, WWII German hat and leather clothing tells us what's what but Navin is oblivious. Unfortunately, the subsequent scene of the caravan rocking and so forth isn't that funny, not at least to me.Although the film is funny in places and falls into the comedy genre, there is a degree of racism that is somewhat surprising. Navin's delight at finding out he will remain white even though his foster parent and family are black Mississippi is a little out of place, as is the representation of the said Hispanic gangsters.

How Evans took Wade successfully through the gauntlet of his gang that was there eager to free him, it was some luck getting out of it alive, but the worst let down was the way Wade went up on the train willingly when he could have easily escaped at that point as the train was already leaving.

So I went in to see 'The Brady Bunch Movie' thinking, this will be a couple of hours of my life I'll never get back. And then I proceeded to laugh my fool ass off. The spoofery here is perfect and dead on target; it seems almost too easy of a kill. The makers of the film must have felt like kids in a candy store. What do you lampoon mercilessly first? Marcia's airheadedly blonde conceit? Jan's borderline-psycho jealousy of Marcia? Mike Brady's emptyheaded homilies? Carol Brady's hairdo? Don't get impatient, the film gets to all of them in due course, and many others. 'The Brady Bunch Movie' basically takes the Brady family on its own terms but thrusts them into the 1990's where they are even more out of place than before. The principal running joke is that they don't consider themselves odd at all, in fact the Bradys feel they are the hippest, best-looking, and smartest family God ever created. They are oblivious to an outside world that variously treats them with bewilderment, astonishment, and sometimes outright contempt. Doesn't faze them in the slightest. The early seventies, when the original series prospered, were a strange time anyway. In a way, the sixties hadn't really ended. Disco and Saturday Night Live were yet to come. 'The Brady Bunch' was the latest of a type of show that had been a staple of network television since its inception, the family situation comedy. 'Father Knows Best,' 'The Donna Reed Show,' and of course 'Leave It To Beaver' were the prototypes. One might think 'The Brady Bunch' would have been the last of its breed, but the format's enduring appeal lived on in such shows as 'Eight Is Enough' and 'Full House.' 'The Brady Bunch' is definitely an artifact of its time though, more noticeably so than the other examples given, given the 60's background and affectations in dress, hairstyles, and dialogue. So bringing this determinedly odd and stupid family into the 90's was a stroke of genius, and what resulted was a sharp parody that made a lot of money and was followed by a sequel. Some of the best bits include continual run-ins with their neighbor, Mr. Dittmeyer, and his boozy, lustful wife, who clearly wishes to engage in a threesome with Greg and Peter. The Brady's astroturf lawn is still there, and another neighbor comments in amazement, One time I was over there. One bathroom for nine people? And I never did see a toilet. Then there's Greg Brady's line to several female classmates, Hey there, groovy chicks. You're all hep in far out ways. And Marcia's comforting words to Jan, who is worried about moving because she'll have to make new friends. Jan, you don't have any friends.

Jackson that made it so clear that was what it was all about and that was some thirty-odd years before the great conflict. of course it was about ideals and we all know literacy wasn't that great in those days so an inspirational speech may have been the vehicle to get some of these simple boys to fight. i know that scene with rebs being interrogated by chamberlain's brother was overdone, but when those southerners retorted about their rights, they weren't acting. those poor downtrodden white boys of the south had been fooled into thinking they were fighting a war against an ever encroaching federal government, and maybe they were right. i live, hell i was born in Virginia, and i believe that if i am to be held for a crime, it should be the governor of Virginia that accuses me of a crime, that i should be punished by laws applicable to Virginia. after all, for all those out there who know Virginia's history, we did not ratify the constitution until it was already ratified by the necessary 2\/3, in other words, we didn't support the constitution because it didn't go far enough to support civil liberties. don't forget, we're the home of Patrick henry, a major detractor of that hideous document. he knew that the second amendment did not go far enough. as it reads, people can only have guns for the support of the militia, so as not to have a Bastille where all the guns are in one place. in other words, the 2nd amend means that people can have guns in there homes because it is the governments best interest not to have all arms located in place lest some rebel force react and try to take over the central arsenal, e.g. the Bastille. the 2nd amend was never meant to guarantee average citizens the right to bear arms and henry knew it and that's why he fought so hard against Hamilton's oligarchy. but back to the movie, all in all, we're lucky to have it. it could've been better, but i guess Forrest gump could've been too, or maybe Casablanca, or the longest day, etc, etc, guess someone could've done Charles ingalls better than m. Landon, guess someone could've been better first pres than g. Washington. where does it stop?

All is well until their young daughter, Carol Anne, starts hearing voices coming from the TV static and strange ghostly episodes begin to occur. Are they living in a haunted house ?Poltergeist is probably the best example of the contemporary ghost story movie - it's fun, extremely well-made, and is packed full of terrific scares. It takes the opposite approach from normal; there's no big old spooky house or gruesome back-story of some patriarch walling people up in the tower. By contrast, the Freelings are the most normal family you could imagine and Cuesta Verde could be any middle-class suburb anywhere. The movie uses this backdrop of ordinariness to really bring the hauntings and monstrous visions to life; they seem somehow more real and shocking because these people and this place seem real. The movie perhaps segues a little too fast from the minor phenomena to Carol Anne's disappearance into the spirit world, but Williams and Nelson are so good that they make it work. Here are two actors who are asked to react to the most insane and bizarre situations but they jump right in, play it straight, keep their characters grounded, and both deliver sensational performances. Both Rubinstein (who is four-foot-three) and five-year-old O'Rourke are truly iconic; Rubinstein's hair-raising whispered speech about the evil spirit is a highlight - It keeps Carol Anne very close to it and away from the spectral light. It lies to her. It says things only a child can understand ... , and O'Rourke is sweet, haunted, funny and touching, one of the most memorable child performances. Paramount as ever in a good horror movie are the fabulous tracking-in photography of Matthew F. Leonetti and a super-creepy score by Jerry Goldsmith which alternates the numerous nail-biting sequences with unsettlingly pleasant nursery-rhyme lullabies. It also has some of the most startling effects in any ghost movie - both Richard Edlund's amazing spirit-light creatures and some sensational floor effects (a set of chairs that stack in an uncut shot, a dizzying elongating corridor effect done in the camera, a scene where Williams is thrown up a wall and across the roof) contribute greatly to the scares and the atmosphere. Too often nowadays filmmakers just get lazy with CGI (see the remake of The Haunting), but this has original and imaginative effects which really work. There is some controversy over the authorship of this film; Steven Spielberg wrote the original story, co-scripted and co-produced it, and is rumoured to have supervised the direction, whatever that means. All I know is that it's beautifully made and Hooper (the auteur of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and several other great but critically lambasted films) is the credited director so he's the guy I tip my hat to. He's made a classic ghost movie which is scary as hell despite the fact that it takes place in the here and now and nobody even gets killed. Tragically, both young actresses in this film died far too young; Dunne (the sister of Griffin Dunne) was murdered in 1982, aged 22, and O'Rourke died of complications from Crohn's Disease in 1988, aged 12. Followed by two sequels, which, as usual, are not much of a patch on the original. A fabulously enjoyable horror film.
