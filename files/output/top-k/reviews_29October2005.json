This semi-sequel to the popular Nightmare on Elm Street series (begun in 1984) takes place in the real world, and revolves around actress Heather Langenkamp and her fame after the success of the films.However, ten years after the original, a stalker has started to leave her menacing phone calls mimicking the voice of Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), the infamous character who - in the film series itself - is the dead pedophile who lives in children's dreams and kills them in their sleep.Freddy was killed off in the last Nightmare movie and now he's crossing over into the real world to seek revenge. He kills Heather's husband and begins to go after her son, Dylan (Miko Hughes), who is plagued by terrifying nightmares.Meanwhile, Robert Englund suffers similar scares and begins to have odd visions involving his character Freddy.New Nightmare is a very clever film, but it's not perfect. In terms of scares, it is far more polished than the original - a larger budget, better makeup, and generally just more professional. The scary moments are more tense and frightening.But there are some lapses in logic. Heather's husband dies and she doesn't seem to care very much (this may have to do with the fact that she's simply a bad actress to begin with, but it also just might be a bad script). She visits the morgue and leaves her son at home in the middle of the morning - presumably without a babysitter. A bit of an odd thing to do after having obsessed about making sure he wasn't alone at any given time due to his Freddy visions.Similar inconsistencies occur throughout the film, but in my opinion, it's about on par with the original Nightmare on Elm Street and probably - at least from a technical perspective - the best of the bunch. I generally enjoy clever, self-referential films and that's just an added bonus here - I'd call this the most original and witty entry in the series, by far.

So I believe that in order to appreciate films, you should watch everything; to become a cultured person in the matter. Not just watch the contemporary films, or in Descartes mode, watch only the films made after I was born.Everything includes classics like From here to eternity. Made in black and white with pure passion. While I watched I tried to think about the way movies were made at those times. The power the big female stars like Deborah Kerr had, the money actors like Burt Lancaster made per movie, the low budget of the projects, the little shooting time.What were the results? In the case of From here to eternity; an Oscar winning film where everything fits perfectly. Because it was not easy to make it work, or at I least that's what I think. I think that at the time there was an honest cinema, with lots of true spoken words. Nowadays we have P.T. Anderson and his encounters between people, but in the 50's it took a man named Daniel Taradash to make moving a two people chat.When Private Prewitt (Montgomery Clift) arrives in Schofield, he has a little catch-up talk with a soldier. In three minutes, with non-exaggerated words, we understand the essence of Clift's character. The army is his life; and he's destined to end his days there. He'll have his problems, he'll have to fight, he'll have to gain his place, but that's how things go with the hero. Then he'll meet his woman Alma (Donna Reed) and fight for love, too.But it's not just about him and his love story. There's another man, Prewitt's superior; Sergeant Milton Warden (Burt Lancaster), who has another superior, Captain Dana Holmes. However, Holmes goes out with friends and the honorable Warden does all the work. From time to time, Holmes' wife Karen (Deborah Kerr) visits the base, and the Sergeant approaches. Later both of them experience two of the most romantic scenes I've ever witnessed.And here comes an issue probably discussed many times. In a movie where the character that highlights the most is Prewitt, Montgomery Clift is second-billed, and Lancaster is first. Yet Lancaster goes into the water and the sand with Deborah Kerr, third-billed. Who is the leading man? Lancaster or Clift?

The problem with The Phantom Menace is that he simply has no story to tell. The film merely adds an introductory chapter to a story that has already been told, and stretches it out into a two-hour movie. It is no accident that prequels of this kind are rare. They are very difficult to make properly. And apparently he's just not a sophisticated enough filmmaker to pull it off.For one thing, this project is limited by the fact that anyone familiar with the first trilogy knows the story's outcome, and it therefore lacks some of the suspense associated with a gradually unfolding saga. More importantly, however, this situation leaves Lucas with very little freedom as a storyteller. It also encourages him to gloss over key events; because their outcome is a foregone conclusion, he forgets to bring them to life.For example, we know there will eventually be a romance between Anakin and Padme. So Lucas has the two characters meet here and--surprise, surprise--they seem to like each other. Their developing friendship isn't portrayed that clearly, and their motivations for becoming close aren't explained. Because Lucas fails to make scenes like these believable, we can't help being conscious of how he's manipulating the plot in his effort to connect the two trilogies. Another good example of this problem is Anakin's portrayal as a potential Jedi. There doesn't appear to be anything about this kid remotely out of the ordinary, even though the other characters keep talking like there is. Our only reason for thinking he's special is that the plot requires it.If the story fails to be engaging, it is because we never see the important events. Lucas makes a fatal error in not showing what's happening on Naboo, the small planet whose capture is the focus of the plot. Numerous atrocities are supposedly being committed against the planet's inhabitants, but we only know about this because the characters on screen refer to the events, usually rather woodenly.The deadpan performances are a problem in themselves, but they only highlight our lack of involvement in the story. Think of Han Solo sweating in fear, then think of the emotional vacuums passing for characters in this film. Whenever any of the characters do express emotion, as in the scene where Anakin and his mom part, it still seems awfully restrained. Somehow, Lucas manages to keep the emotional reactions of his characters to a minimum, which gives the film an almost mechanical feel.It's true that A New Hope never showed Alderaan's inhabitants, but we still could feel the tragedy of the planet's destruction through the horrified reactions of Princess Leia and Obi Wan. Moreover, there were many other involving events which we witnessed directly, such as the slaying of rebels at the beginning; the capture and torture of the princess; and the murder of Luke's foster parents. Furthermore, the major plot elements were intriguing in and of themselves. They weren't there merely to show us how they were to be linked to later events, which seems to be the case with the new film.I suspect that Lucas was not as concerned in the first trilogy with what had to happen later in the story and was therefore able to focus his attention on the events at hand. The weakest segment was Return of the Jedi, which had the task of bringing the story to an end. Only then did Lucas start to show signs of forcing plot points. In The Phantom Menace, he gets so bogged down in the task of bringing his story from point A to point B that he ends up with only the bare bones of a plot, and none of it comes alive.This is especially true of the characterization. In the old trilogy, characters like Yoda and Han reveal distinct personalities in their first few minutes on screen. This film goes for more than two hours and the characters, including the familiar ones, come off vague and nondescript. We aren't given much of a chance to experience their personalities in the way they interact. We must take Qui Gon's word for it when he describes Obi Wan as headstrong. What's most odd is that the cartoons seem better developed than the humans. The scenes where Qui Gon negotiates with the birdlike slave-owner Watto are amusing and well-done--probably the movie's best scenes aside from the stunning action sequences--but they can't hold a candle to the constant interactions throughout the first trilogy.One thing I cannot do is accuse the film of lacking creativity. The design of the creatures, the technologies, and the planets is impressive. Watching the film is sort of like reading a children's book that isn't very good but abounds with beautiful illustrations. There is certainly a wow factor in the movie's visuals, but the effect of it is short-lived.I get irked when I hear fans talk as though the Star Wars movies were never about anything beyond special effects. While the inventive visuals are part of what made the originals so revolutionary, they're not what made the films so fun to watch. And in no way can they explain the trilogy's continuing popularity today. After all, many of the original effects look primitive by today's standards, and their novelty has certainly worn off. Only an enduring and compelling storyline could have allowed the first three films to become the classics they're almost universally acknowledged to be.

The Coen Brothers have always been a favorite of my family and The Dude looks, acts, and talks exactly like my dead father.That said, my high score for this film is not just because I like it, but because it's excellent. I'm going to save the usual great directing, acting, cinematography, editing, and humor (all of which it has) and move into a few unique traits of this film that never cease to fascinate me no matter how many times I watch it.First of all, the dialog specifically. Move over, Tarantino and Kevin Smith, you have been owned. This dialog is faster, wittier, more real, and creates better characters through tangents than you could hope possible. Was the dialog even written down? Most of the time it seems the actors are just playing off each other's direction and they are talking about whatever they want to, and yet previous conversations and conceits and the like keep re-emerging later, characters go off on regular tangents (and I'm not just talking about the Vietnam War, either), and the actors never, ever fall out of character. It's amazing to behold.Secondly, the storyline's general arch. Many conversations I've had with people end up going into a lot of discussion over the fact that he never gets his rug back. In fact, the whole movie is kind of tragic in the way The Dude ends up worse off than he was before, but then again he's happier and the status quo has returned, so it's still contained brilliantly. The thing is that the Coen brothers tend to write very character-driven plots, where the character's personalities do so much more than the events they create to propel them into more and more absurd situations. Furthermore, it's not like the characters just move on to the next scene and the last scene is almost irregardless, like a lot of lesser character-driven plots it all ties together and is contained beautifully. This movie could not have ended any other way.Finally, I won't bore you with the regular talk about how great a character The Dude is (even though he is), I want to talk about Walter Sobchack. Honestly, this the role John Goodman was born to do, and of course he did it brilliantly. Not only can I not imagine anyone else doing it, I can't imagine anybody else perfectly complimenting Dude.

My mother was full blooded Italian, so I really know Italian families, and I LOVE mobster movies, even the funny ones like this.For those people who have bad rapped this film (you know who you are) you should have your movie privileges taken from you because you don't know what good is. This is a damn funny and well-styled film. The fact that almost nobody is Italian in it is part of the joke, so far as I can see. And what red-blooded straight male could complain about spending an hour and something with the likes of Michelle Pfieffer? Puh-lease! When I saw this film it won me over with the opening song by Rosemary Clooney who was as Irish as one can get, but her pronunciation of the Italian words in Mambo Italiano is flawless and sets the tone of what is to follow perfectly. (Hell, I even bought the record the next day because of it.) Just the look of every garish thing in the apartment that I have personally seen in my relatives houses, though not in the same place (which I found hysterical) sold it for me.This movie is like Goodfellas on laughing gas.

Even back then it entertained me, enough for my parents to have to play it whenever they wanted to keep me out of trouble. One would expect that anything that can hold the attention of a toddler is not going to have the same effect on an adult. I am glad to say that it does. I can watch this film today with the same eagerness, the same enjoyment and the same suspension of knowledge of what's going to happen. Who could help doing otherwise? It's first class storytelling.There are the age-old characters, archetypes as well known as the story itself. In a twist of genius, the tale is set in the animal world. Robin Hood, everyone's hero, brought to magnificent life by a fox and given a dashing yet endearing voice. There's his ladylove, the long-lashed, elegant, eminently lovable Maid Marian, also a fox and just as perfectly voiced. One look at Marian, and it's easy to understand why Robin is so lost in his dreams of her that he ruins the stew he's been stirring.Prince John, however likable the others, has somehow topped my list. Fittingly chosen to be a mane-less lion (compare his appearance with his brother Richard who has an ample mane), constantly whining for his mother when thwarted and complaining about Richard, he is the best representation of John I've ever seen. One mustn't forget his penchant for alliterating, in especial reference to his much put-upon sidekick\/adviser Sir Hiss, a snake. Priceless gems like Procrastinating Python, Slithering Serpent and of course the irresistible You eel in snake's clothing can all be heard directed at the pitiable Sir Hiss whenever John is frustrated in his plans to capture the elusive Robin. The unfortunate duo plays off each other very well. It must be said that whoever thought of getting Sir Peter Ustinov to voice the role of P.J. should have been promoted instantly. The late, brilliant Ustinov is greatly missed, but he lives on in his wonderful comedic works. His part here is right up there with his best performances. No one could have done greater justice to the younger brother who (rightly) feels that his governance compares unfavourably with Richard's.A few other characters deserve to be mentioned. Little John, a bear very reminiscent of Jungle Book's Baloo, is light-hearted, trustworthy and the perfect companion and friend for our Robin. On one occasion early on, they have a great outing together as cross-dressers and use their very believable disguise to steal P.J. for everything he has on him. As for his voice, Little John's carefree American accent works very well alongside the British ones of the others. The lady-in-waiting to Marian, Clucky, is a brave lass and Friar Tuck is a kind old fellow. There are also the kids in the family of rabbits who understandably admire and adore Robin and Marian.The script is smashing. What with the comedy, the heroic and witty lines for the good guys and the hysterical silliness of the sour villains of the story, this is a winner. It's always fun and never grows tired. The little ditty about Prince John's incompetence that goes around (too late to be known as John the first, he's sure to be known as John the worst) is very in keeping with the rest of this film's tone. And who can forget the sheer madness of such a line as I sentence you to sudden, instant and even immediate death, courtesy of Prince John of course.It's not only comedy, because to top it all off, this film must have the best confession of love ever filmed. Although it works infinitely better when you watch it, I will attempt to sketch it here. Caught, tied up, sentenced and threatened with execution, Robin looks into Marian's expressive eyes and says Marian my darling, I love you more than life itself. Her emotional response is an equally memorable one to behold. More sweetness inevitably follows in the eventual escape, but I'll leave that for your viewing pleasure.The film wouldn't be complete without a fitting climax, and to satisfy us all, we've been given a good one. Climbing to the top of a turret, Robin has to leap down into the moat to avoid the fires that are close on his heels. His friends down below look on to see where he surfaces and are dismayed to find Robin appearing nowhere yet, to the delight of Prince John and Sir Hiss. It's a nice tug at the heartstrings. Although initially all hope seems lost, we know that the story isn't finished until the deserving Robin gets to be with his Marian and all's right with Nottingham and England.Disney surpassed themselves with this one. It's much more than the sum of its parts (voice talent and likable characters, witty script, character designs, plotting).

SPOILER BELOW! The story of how Vasily Zaitsev became a national hero is told well against the backdrop of the gruesome Battle for Stalingrad. The apocryphal story of Heinz Thorvald \/ Major Koenig's hunt for Zaitsev is the focal point of the movie.This plot device creates a number of unbelievable situations (e.g., three snipers being sent to clear a building, instead of a squad of regular infantry), but the storyteller manages to build suspense and keep it entertaining.The three leads (Law, Harris, and Weizs) all turn in excellent performances, as do Joseph Fiennes as Danilov, and the boy playing Sasha. I found myself feeling sympathy for both Zaitsev and Koenig, unusual considering that they were both fighting for despicable regimes whose barbarity is depicted unsparingly. The film accurately shows the kind of hideous stuff that happens in war without any glorification or sentiment. Like the characters, you really would rather be somewhere else.Anyone who has done any shooting will be bothered by certain technical flaws, i.e., hitting a horizontal cable at 100 meters is virtually impossible because the sniper would have to get the range exactly right. Even if he managed to aim on target, those type of sniper rifles do not group so tightly that you could hit a cable without a lucky shot. Also, Zaitsev's offhand shot at Koenig after he gets away from the stove would be unlikely to hit anything. But if it hit his hand, the bullet would break bone and sever a tendon, crippling his hand, before piercing the stock of the rifle entirely, with the remains of the bullet ripping a hole in Koenig's guts. If the metal frame of the rifle stopped it, it would still break ribs -- full sized rifle rounds have a lot of energy.But the ending really disappointed. After Danilov is slain, if Zaitsev had managed a lucky shot into Koenig's blind, this would have preserved a sense of reality. But for Koenig, drawn as patient, methodical, never makes a mistake, to leave his hide and expose himself, and for Zaitsev to do the same and take him with an offhand shot at pistol range, was just beyond loony. Both characters violated who they were in the film. This was too Hollywood High Noon for a film depicting otherwise believable people.Also Koenig, a regular Wehrmacht officer from an upper class family, not some Gestapo scumbag, would never hang Sasha for passing information that he fully expected him to give to the other side.

Everything about it is superb. While it may appear to be a film which mainly appeals to women, I think that the men should give it a chance too - a substantial part of the storyline is from George Gulden's (William Hurt) point of view, as the father of the family.Through 'One True Thing', we see how a family copes with disease - from everybody's point of view. Although we follow the story from Ellen Gulden's (Renee Zellweger) eyes, it never feels like we're missing out on anything.The strongest point of the film is the superb acting.

I only say that because Nightwatch is drifting between these two categories. There's always a very tricky element with who-dunnit's, if it's easy to guess, it's automatically branded as shite. But when it turns out to be someone who didn't actually feature in the film, I think that is worse, simple cowardice on the writer\/directors part. They're too worried we might guess. I have watched this film with three people, and only one guessed it was Cray. the rest of us had either the doctor or James on our minds. The guesser said it was because of the two speeches Cray made, about 'there is no how or why, they are long past the need to justify what they do, he wants the killing to stop.' But I thought those fitted well with him being an experienced homicide policeman. I'm glad i didn't guess.What I thought stank was the James thing. for almost the whole film you think it' s him, then when I watched it again, there is no way to explain his behaviour. In the laundromat for example. The director was so caught up in steering us away from Cray and towards James, that he didn't stop to think 'if he's innocent, why would he do that?' Someone said it's because he's nervous, but it still doesn't mesh. There is also some genuinely cringey dialogue; 'You know I can't be alone.' 'The wrong guy I guess. I guess they got the wrong guy.' 'I'm sworn to secrecy.' I was always wondering why they were saying it. My last nit-pick is the scene where Martin discovers the prostitutes body is gone. Firstly, there is NO way he could have missed it when he first came in. Then, how could Cray get in, move the body, move it back and clean up the blood? Unless martin was dreaming, but it doesn't feel like it. I know it sounds like I hated it, but what bugs me are flawed masterpieces. This had the potential to be a huge blockbuster hit, but the combination of bad script and... I was going to say directing but no, only script. The directing was excellent actually. I loved the bit where he forgets to turn off the lights, then reaches an arm back in and it looks like something's coming to get him. If someone had re-wrought a lot of the dialogue and smoothed over the big pot-holes in the story, this could have been a huge hit. The actors are to be congratulated, doing a stellar job with some dire stuff. Patricia Arquette in particular. Just a facial expression turned an awful scene around. James as well, the least-likable character in history, with his crossed-the-line jokes and creepy fascinations. He then redeems himself by cutting his thumb off (vile) to escape handcuffs and save Kathrine and Martin. Finally our leading man. What I loved about this character was he is the polar opposite of the Hollywood He-man Hunk. An ordinary bloke. When this rarity stumbles onto the silver screen we have a tendency to be snickering 'wimp' between scenes. Ridiculous. Secret Window for example. Mort sees a guy with a screw-driver in his head, vomits and collapses. Is there a human on the planet who would not do exactly that? But when you get down to it, Martin is spineless by anyones standards. Twenty-two is too old to be giving in to peer-pressure! It really is.Apparently Danny Boyle (director of Ewan films Trainspotting, Shallow grave and A Life Less Ordinary) thought the accent was awful and that is why his character in A Life Less Ordinary was changed from American to Scottish. I like his American accent. it's not the one you always hear, but Star-spangled none-the-less. Though in Velvet Goldmine it's very much improved. All in all, this is a great film. Not in plot perhaps, but the spirit, acting and camera work are consistently tense and involving. Pretty important to any Ewan fan, this being his first American exploit. 8\/10 At least!

Big budget superhero movies hadn't been successful in ages, the last attempt being the abominable flop 'Batman and Robin'. As well, X-Men incorporated a huge cast, most of which were big name actors, almost all of whom needed roughly equal screen time to make the story work. All in all, it seemed a lot to juggle to make work.Lucky it seems then that a director was attached to the project who actually knew what he was doing. Brian Singer, whose credentials included 'The Usual Suspects', a heist thriller known as one of the most brilliantly executed of all time and 'Apt Pupil', detailing the life of an ex-Nazi trying to incorporate himself into an ordinary lifestyle; seemed like the kind of director who would pass off a comic book film as too lowbrow. But Singer instead embraced the deeper themes of the story, such as societal prejudice and exclusion, and played them for maximum effect. And it worked; X-Men seems surprisingly grounded in reality considering it features characters able to blast laser beams from their eyes and control the weather. The viewer can almost picture themselves inhabiting a world where parents are afraid of their children going to school with the mutant kids.Singer also comprehensively explores the comic backstory of the characters, and brings this into effect. And yet, for all the comic book trivia incorporated into the movie, the plot never sags, or seems overcrowded. Such traits as Professor Xavier(Patrick Stewart)'s paternal instinct towards Cyclops (James Marsden), his first student are expressed in only a couple of lines, and yet become definitive and clear to the audience. We also see such characters as Pyro, Shadowcat and Colossus (who made larger appearances in the second movie) take cameos, as if to see which comic fans are paying attention. Truly a classy directorial move. There's also several knowing winks to the characters backstories (the what would you prefer - yellow spandex? line being the most obvious) as well as several cheeky and intelligent touches, such as Wolverine's middle claw, and keep your eye open comment to Cyclops.It also helps that Singer has managed to assemble a stellar cast to bring the much loved characters to life. The movie built solid careers for relative newcomers Hugh Jackman and Rebecca Romijn, and certainly brought Halle Berry more into the commercial spotlight. But the movie not only features many well known actors, but also manages to perfectly capture the essence of the age old characters. Hugh Jackman seems born to play Wolverine; every gesture, every move he makes is purely in character. This also seems to be the case for Patrick Stewart, who makes a pitch perfect Professor Xavier, trainer and mentor to the X-Men. Famke Janssen is a superb Jean Grey giving more depth to what could have been a character written with very little to do. James Marsden also brings the overly strict Cyclops truly to life; his back and forth exchanges with the defiant Wolverine are comic genius, and straight out of the comics. Halle Berry may not have been the most economic choice for Storm (as her behaviour regarding the 2 sequels proves) but she does bring a certain credibility and truth to her character. Ray Park also proves that despite being constantly cast for his stunt skills, he most certainly act, playing a truly edgy and gross Toad, who in the comics was a simpering moron. Rebecca Romijn gives a dangerous edge to the shape shifting Mystique, despite almost certainly being cast for her stunning looks, displayed in full glory, as she is never clothed, with only a few tastefully placed scales, leaving tantalisingly little to the imagination. Wrestler Tyler Mane also makes a menacing and genuinely frightening Sabertooth. But in this cast full of standouts, if one had to pick the single most affecting performance, the only contender is Sir Ian McKellan as the humanitarian villain Magneto. Again, it only goes to show that good casting counts for so very much what could have been reduced to a campy, ranting performance by another actor is instead morphed into a dignified, cultured and genuinely angry villain. McKellan seems to build layers of repression and injustice into his very soul, with the truthfulness he projects his hatred for humankind, and their intolerance for anything different from themselves. In fact, if it wasn't for Hugh Jackman's brilliant performance, McKellan would easily walk away with the film unchallenged. As is, the picture still belongs to him, but it's an extremely close thing. The exchanges between Magneto and Wolverine are dynamic; you could swear you feel the very air crackling with intensity. So in the end, there's really nothing not to love about X-Men - an incredibly truthful, intelligent and relevant script is brought to life in a remarkably tasteful and affecting manner by a truly skilled director. The tremendously capable cast bring their characters to life in a truly satisfying way, and it's all tied together by a truly enjoyable and powerful score by the late Michael Kamen. All in all, the tremendous success of X-Men served to birth other successful superhero films, such as the Spider-Man series and the recent Batman Begins. But even if viewed as a stand alone, X-Men proves a superbly enjoyable and very solidly made film.-9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"29 October 2005","score":"","review":" When you look at in, X-Men really was a risk when it was first released in 2000.

God, now that I've said that, I really miss movies like this where love was consensual and affectionate and to the point. I could see Grant and Marie Saint liked each other the moment they laid eyes on each other, but that comes later!First of all, Alfred Hitchcock wants us to feel sorry for Grants character in the beginning(but oh was it so hard considering the material in it I felt like busting a gut laughing so hard). But as the movie progresses, I for one begin to think that Grant was enjoying putting the cape on and flying around like Superman, making him as he mentions in the movie to Marie Saints question of why he was divorced two times, my exes thought I lead a dull life. Well maybe they want to reconsider that , too bad Marie Saint has you now, but will she be divorcée number three, or will she stay and maybe make you into the eternal superhero that you longed to play, and retire the monotonous personality and lay him in rest forever.Two things I like about this movie...the plot and the crop duster scene.

A lot of people thought or think that James Stewart was perfect for this role(after all he craved for the part), but unfortunately it belongs to Carey Grant and Hitchcock , oh and Landeau and Saint, without these four essential figures, we might of saw a different North By Northwest and would it be the same? Would it have the same impact? Would we feel threatened just watching on a television screen a airplane jumping at us?

","genre":"Adventure, Crime, Mystery"},{"date":"29 October 2005","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" The Straight Story directed by David Lynchis based on the true story of Alvin Straight, who in 1994 drove a lawn mower more than 300 miles from Iowa to Wisconsin to visit his sick brother. Both brothers are aged and in poor health. They haven't spoken to each other in 10 years due to an angry spat involving alcohol and pride. But after brother Lyle suffers a stroke, Alvin decides it's time to swallow his pride and connect again with his brother, recalling how close and supportive their relationship used to be long ago. Alvin is determined, in a stubborn Midwestern cowboy manner, to make the trip independently on his own. But as his eyesight is bad and he's got no driver's license, and very little pension income, the only plan is the lawn mower, towing a makeshift trailer for his camp. The trip takes more than five weeks of slow going, with a few misadventures along the way. He also has a string of opportunities to dispense a basic earthy yet pithily eloquent wisdom to everyone he meets along the way.But excitement and danger are not part of Lynch's interest here. The plot is quiet, the pace slow, and the genuine suspense is built from a deep yet common situation longing to reconnect with family members. What strikes me about this film is that we do experience it as slow and quiet, yet simultaneously as absorbing and suspenseful. We are really with Alvin all the way, and for him. Every reviewer has remarked the surprise of a David Lynch film that seems the opposite of his trademark style rather than disturbing pathology beneath the fake veneer of American small town life, we have here a very different perspective an almost sentimental appreciation of small town community the fellow concern, neighborly intimacy, family closeness, the peaceful streets, etc. These are fully evoked and nowhere satirized, a real shock coming from Lynch's former postmodernist terror films in the same settings. Straight here is a pun on the man's name, and also on the narrative sensibility without irony, a simple chronology, one good protagonist, and only universal mortality and individual shortcomings as the real antagonist. The miracle of this film is that this all works well as a film per se. It is a remarkable achievement. Lynch does have his old tongue in his cheek when overtly alluding to his former dark style, especially in the opening scene before we meet Alvin but only hear a mysterious thump to the tune of foreboding dissonant chords. But this allusion is a conscious ploy to remind us that Lynch could have gone there again, but he doesn't. The thump quickly turns out to be merely Alvin's fall on the floor as his cane slipped. The characters who find him on the floor are meant as a parody of the former Lynch audience expectations terror. But this is all lightheartedly dispelled, and we are launched into a new perspective from there-- the straight story, based on a real-life heartwarming human interest piece. The film might illustrate a deeper point about postmodernism it's not about style and narrative sophistication, but rather about what Nietzsche called perspectivism. The deep feeling about simple values and family connections here is another perspective, just as perfectly valid in this vision as the darker perspective that made Lynch infamous.
