I am just old enough to remember the original Scooby Doo cartoons on rerun, and was at the high end of the right target age group when Scrappy Doo hit the scene, and of course remembered Scooby Doo with a certain love. Of course, the cartoon was actually pretty terrible; the writing was bad, the cliches came in at a rate of knots, and the animation was second rate... but that's what we all expected of Hanna-Barbara cartoons.I digress I had heard about SD the movie on the Internet quite early in production and let out a groan; my childhood was being raped again for a buck in Hollywood. Why? Why bother??? Then when I heard Scooby was going to be CGI I actually groaned again. Of course, there is no other way you could have pulled Scoob off on-screen without CGI, at least not realistically... but CGI... that's just so passe any more! I still enjoy the artistry in modern CGI, but to me it felt like SD was going to be done just to prove that it COULD be done with modern technology... not to tell a story.So it came, I read a few online reviews that panned it and failed to be surprised. I caught the trailers and failed to be inspired. I steadfastly avoided the movie theatres and just didn't go see it.Fast forward to July of 2003; SD is playing on Cinemax (I think) and I've got some time to kill. Aw, what the hell... could be good for background noise if nothing else...So having sat through SD the Movie, what do I think? Well, as much as I wanted to hate it because it was Hollywood raping my childhood, I just couldn't. I'm not going to say I loved it because that wouldn't be true, but I'll be darned if I can't admit that it was a whole hell of a lot better than I expected. Let me fill you in;The cast is incredible. They have a real on-screen chemistry that really makes the movie for me. Especially Matthew Lillard as Shaggy... if he hasn't just completely NAILED the character as perfectly as you could in live action, then I'm the queen of France. There's the romantic attraction between Daphne and Fred that comes out on-screen pretty much throughout, and of course the distant attraction Velma had for Fred is right there too. But do I detect a little bit of an attraction to Shaggy? Don't remember that in the cartoon... but I can accept that.The story? Well, it's a hell of a lot better written than the cartoons! Yes, it borrows heavily from them (and borrows from some of the SD animated movies that have been made in the interim), but still it's an interesting story with a nice twist at the end that had me actually laughing out loud. Not Shakespeare by any stretch of the imagination... but a fun and engaging story that keeps your attention.So what about the CGI Scoob? Wow is all I can say! I don't know what makes it more, the quality of the CGI or the way in which all the actors really made me believe they were sharing the screen with a 6'5 intelligent dog. The interactions were believable, and not once did I catch anyone making the mistake of looking in the wrong place on-screen (which is clearly evident in many instances where CGI characters are used). The personality is captured perfectly and translates Scooby from the two-color animation of my youth to a perfect rendition of how I envisaged him in my minds eye.I'm sure many have heard about them already, but there are plenty of in-jokes that pepper the movie for those willing to pay attention. I won't say they're all laugh-out-loud funny, but they are amusing... and it was obvious pretty early on that the film-makers didn't like Scrappy Doo either (I know I didn't... I didn't even like him as a kid), but rather than pretend he never happened (*cough* Galactica 1980 *cough*) they actually bring him to life in this movie too... and actually he has one of the lines that made me laugh out loud (to those who have seen it, it's the line he never finishes saying...)So did I love it as much as I loved Scooby as a kid? No. The movie was definitely not without flaws, and it did depart from the cartoons in some pretty major ways; for example one of the nice things about the cartoon (looking at it now from an adult's perspective) was that at the end of every episode it was reiterated however lightly that there are no such things as monsters, ghosts, ghouls etc. and that we as people are always responsible for these things. This is something I picked up on as a kid but didn't understand until I was an adult; and kids should be given that reassurance early in life that there are no monsters. The movie departed from that part of the formula... so personally I couldn't recommend the movie to younger (under about 8 or 9) children. However, even with these kids, recommend that a parent watch it with them... but of course there's plenty of adult-type humor in there too that will completely pass the kids by. To me that's the mark of a great kids movie these days; the ability to appeal to all ages.Overall, I'd say a 7 out of 10.

I think that this is the best romantic film of all time because it concentrates primarily on love. For example, Titanic is a great love story but the whole fact behind the ship sinking steals the show. Or for example, in Casablanca where their is great romance between Bogurt and Bergman, World War II is going on in the background, which fades the romance. Somewhere in Time is a film where you just have to simply put your criticism aside, and view. The first time I ever saw this film, I liked it. The more I viewed it, I loved it. This film has the ability to make anybody cry if they really have a heart. The thing that makes this film so romantic is it's innocence. No huge plots going on, but simply a man loving a woman.I have to say though, that Christopher Reeve was rather poor in certain scenes where he would commonly ask or answer questions directly after they had been said. But that is just a minor film error that a lot of people would tend not to even notice. I really enjoyed Jane Seymour in this film for her charasmatic acting, and her amazing beauty. The scene when Richard sees Elise for the first time in person by the lake, will give you heartfelt chills. They both make such a great on-screen duo together, but Christopher Plummer is by far the greatest actor in this film, and one of the greatest of all time. He has the ability to play so many different characters and still acts on broadway. In this film, Plummer plays the snobbish William Robertson who does everything to get in the way of Richard and Elise's relationship. Robertson is Elise's manager and is jealous of her and Richard's relationship, wanting to settle down with Elise himself. This movie does have it's funny moments to, like when Richard is trying just to get out of the room he awoke in, in 1912. Or when in 1912, he is signing the hotel registeration book very hesitantly, hoping everything goes as planned. One more thing that I would like to add is the two running men, who appear twice throughout the film running,stopping,boxing a little and then running, which I find hilarious.(keep your eye out for that.)Well all joking aside, this film is a timeless romantic classic, that focuses on the most important thing in life, which is love. It is so romantic how a man risks his modern day life to go back in time and find what he thinks to be,his one. This movie teaches you that you should never take love for granted. I think that love is so beautiful and special that it is worth dying for. I guarantee you, that you're tears will get the better of you in the scene where they reunite outside of the Grand Hotel, after they thought they had lost each other. Unfortunately their relationship on earth is cut short to a tragic ending that will make you cry. After Richard is brought back to modern day, he is mentally dead inside. It is so tragic how he looks at the very spots where they once had been at the hotel. The John Barry score sums up the moments beautifully, and is the most romantic and beautiful music in my opinion, to ever grace cinematography. Believe me, this theme song is enough to make you cry.It is so amazing how all the little parts of the movie come together like pieces of a puzzle, and how Richard and Elise die the exact same way. I always love happy endings, and the ending of this movie will leave you satisfied. If you are a romantic like your's truly, then this movie could change your life on the perspective of the importance of love. I highly recommend this beautiful romantic, to anybody that really has a heart, and that can appreciate this kind of film. 7\/10 (on film perspective) But just perfect for a romantic.

No doubt about it.Really, this would have been a decent sci-fi\/adventure movie, if it hadn't been based on a classic novel and directed by the author's grandson.  I kept hearing about how this would be the definitive version of the novel. What resulted was a pathetic and simpleminded bastardization.The novel is a great sci-fi story but what a lot of people miss when they read it (probably because they read it when they're very young) is that it's overflowing with social commentary.

I started to think that if it wasn't for that, we may never have seen Goodfellas. So if the above is true, thank you Bobby and Marty for making it possible.Goodfellas is one of the very best movies i have ever seen. It's story, it's dialouge, it's visual style, and it's characters force us to sit up and pay attention to the story of a guy who as far back as he could remember always wanted to be a gangster. In what should have been an Oscar-winning performance (more on that later), Ray Liotta delivers as Henry Hill, a half-Irish half-Italian New Yorker who joins the local mob and is introduced to a life most people never have the chance to live. He meets a pretty but fiery woman named Karen (Lorraine Bracco), makes best friends Jimmy (Robert De Niro) and Tommy (Joe Pesci), and becomes a mob saint when he helps pull off a multi-million dollar heist. Slowly but surely, however, the good life turns sour as he cheats on his wife, the heist eventually costs him everything he has and some very dear friends, and he is forced to testify against the people who gave him so much and enter witness protection.Martin Scorsese moves the story along with quick pace, by using hilarious, violent, and emotional scenes alternately. We see Hill's life deteriorate by keeping the glamour and the women at the beginning and the addictions and paranoia towards the end. It is an absolute shame that this film didn't win Best Director (which Scorsese should have one countless times by now), let alone Best Picture, Actor, Supporting Actress, and Adapted Screenplay. This is the reason i don't care for the Oscars anymore. One thing the Academy did do right is give Joe Pesci the Best Supporting Actor award. Never has a character been so funny and so terrifying all in the same film. Pesci was another reason the 2 and a half hour film goes by in a snap.Goodfellas, in my opinion, is even better than the Godfather. While the Godfather may have Marlon Brando's brilliant performance and more visually pleasing locations, Goodfellas is a true gangster picture based on reality and more adaptable to modern times. It is not only a classic, it is a masterpiece. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"29 July 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I once read a story about Martin Scorsese's battle with cocaine addiction and how Robert De Niro saved his life one way or another by visiting him in the hospital and convincing him to get back to work and make Raging Bull.

This is a commendable movie, and Schumacher deserves a lot of credit for his few experimental movies such as this and Phone Booth. Watch it and enjoy Farrel's smartass attitude, or merely his sublime acting, and the skillful direction of Schumacher!

The director, Paul Michael Glasser, is better known to most of us older folks or TVLand viewers as Starsky of the Starsky and Hutch televised cop show. His attention to detail, lighting and camera angles, character development, and his use of sexual and romantic tension was impressive.Like Tin Cup and A League of Their Own (both of which were shot much later), The Cutting Edge caused me to truly focus on specific sports (those of hockey and figure skating) and to appreciate the athletic development process. Even if that process is not portrayed in a manner technically true to form within this movie, the leap of faith is an easy one and you don't lose the passion or the intent of the story in watching it.This movie also made me aware of D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly for the first time. All of their later work, that I've seen, has been compared to the quality displayed within this one. Their portrayal of the development of a relationship shows depth and insight and brings out the comedic characteristics as well.The Cutting Edge holds up well, even after repeated viewings. The scenes that first brought an emotional reaction from me continue to do so (surprisingly) just as strongly as they did the first time. It IS one of my favorite movies. I would recommend renting or purchasing it as the television version dilutes chemistry between the two main characters because of the commercial interruptions.

But instead, everyone who wandered into those theatres opening day expecting to see Michael myers and donald pleasence, were so disappointed that they forgot all about the movie that they were seeing and just hated it because they wanted to see michael follow laurie some more, instead of seeing a film about halloween itself. The best performance in this movie though has to come from Dan O'Herlihy as Cochran. If you thought Myers was evil, then you certainly can not even begin to understand the true sinisterness of this bitter man which is Conal Cochran. So if you are looking for a good horror movie, filled with evil and elements of halloween, track this one down, and forget about myers. Because when you compare this to halloween 9 or ressurection, you can easily tell which one is better. Highly recommended.

De Palma's best picture without a doubt.This is just not the case and although The Untouchables is infinitely watchable, I am afraid to say that it is by no means a great movie.On the plus side, De Niro shines - but then doesn't he always? - and I think that this may be part of the problem.It is almost as if watching his performance and the considerable methodology that has gone into making it such a such a realistic Capone portrayal,that you almost feel as if the film should be more centred around the exploits of this dastardly gangster as opposed to the crime fighting whizz kid Elliot Ness (who eventually indicted him on a tax evasion charge!).I found Costner's interpretation of Ness weak, Garcia's performance good and Connery's tough Malone entertaining but actually pretty comical....I mean, if it hadn't been big Sean up there, who else could have got away with such a woeful Irish accent?Capone pullsh a knife, you pulla gun!....he says in his best Edinburgh lilt...Watch this film by all means, but don't watch it as a De Palma epic or you will be sorely disappointed.To date, if you want to see this wonderful director at his best then slip on those Alligator skin shoes, you're white suit, a massive pair of sunglasses and watch Scarface.Thanks for reading.
