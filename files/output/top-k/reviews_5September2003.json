Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and the Lion King were a hat-trick of classics that matched critical success with financial reward, but what followed was a series of repetitive features which proved the winning formula was being so streamlined that nothing else remained.  In Pocahontas, Hercules and Tarzan, we saw only a misfit who dreamt of being understood and a sidekick or two ready to chip in with the one-liners.  Even the more satisfying efforts, The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Mulan, were burdened with the same old formula.  The theme of the underdog and his sidekick had long been a staple of Disney's output, but there had always been something more, something that elevated it above its repetition.  Now the bare bones were being presented as the living, breathing whole, and the feeling of déjà vu was becoming increasingly irritating.With Disney's offerings looking as stale as one of Lincoln's home made baps, and with the arrival of computer-generated animation, its rivals had their best chance yet at defeating the sleeping giant.  But somehow the opportunity was not matched with films of sufficient quality; The Pebble and the Penguin, Anastasia, Antz, Titan AE and The Road to El Dorado did little to fill the potential gap in the market.  If the response to Disney's stagnation was slow it can be easily understood given that animated features take three or four years to produce, but, still, an opportunity was being missed.In the Spring of 2001, patience was rewarded with Shrek, a CG animation from DreamWorks which wooed the critics, busted blocks and snatched the first ever Best Animated Feature Oscar from under Disney's noses, leaving poor old Walt spinning in his grave faster than a bottle at a pre-teen sleep-over. It was with great anticipation that I sat down to watch it, ready to embrace the cynicism and subversive humour that had been praised so highly.The story of an irritable green ogre sent to rescue a post-feminist Princess began well enough, starting, as so many Disney movies have started, with a book of fairytales being opened and narrated in a non-threatening tone. Suddenly, Shrek, voiced by Mike Myers, tore a page from the book and wiped his butt with it - a promising start.  Unfortunately, it hinted more at its level of humour than at its subversive nature; the jokes begin in the toilet, and there they remain.  The jokes about belching were outnumbered only by the jokes about farting, both of which were abandoned only once, for the high-class humour of seeing Shrek being hit in the groin.Further disappointment came in its feeble attempts to ridicule Disney's monopolistic use of fairytale clichés.  If a film is going to rubbish its predecessors it has to be smarter than the ones it attacks, but Shrek should have a dunce's hat plonked on its big, dumb, empty head.  Like Scream and Galaxy Quest, it comes across as being ill-informed, pointing out some clichés while blindly serving up others with a short memory and a straight face.  Beyond that, the same old Disney sentiment it spends the first forty minutes rubbishing comes on thick and fast in the second half, where we learn that beauty is only skin deep, that friendships should be valued, and that blah blah bliddy blah.Beyond fairytale cliché, Shrek suffers terribly from a mammoth helping of movie cliché.  Jobbing writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio serve up a story of complete conventionality, making us endure such lines as `It's quiet... too quiet' and having their wafer-thin plot hinge on a half-overheard conversation, a plot device so old it was invited to God's christening.Its various faults add up to a missed opportunity, its subversive streak as unconvincing as Mike Myers' Scottish accent.  Disney has its faults - now more than ever - and it deserves to be ridiculed, but it has to be done by something altogether smarter than this.  After all, Shrek is the misfit who dreams of being understood, Eddie Murphy's Donkey is the sidekick on hand to chip in with the one-liners, the Princess teaches us that beauty is only skin deep, and nothing is more Disney than that.

I couldn't be happier to see it finally in the DVD format. But watch closely; you'll notice many subtle, sophisticated things which other viewers have touched on in earlier reviews.

The adaptation of the original Perrault fairy tale is also impressive. An ingenious move was to have the prince and princess meet in the forest *first* and fall in love- unaware that they are already engaged to be married. Someone mentioned the chilling sequence which shows the princess, cloaked in an eerie green pallor, actually being lured to the fateful spinning wheel. So dark, so frightening- when was the last time you saw something like this in a Disney fairy tale? And then immediately afterwords is a cleansing sequence of unmatched beauty showing the fairies sailing through the sky like fireflies, magically dusting the rest of the castle to sleep.

Very very nice. I've grown up with Disney, as have most of us. And I've seen many of the Masterpiece collection, first hand on the big screen. I am also a fan of Disney's non-Christian views and presentations of the world. They make you use that imagination, whether you want to, or not. They have a way of making a person face the harsh realities of life, and realize that life will go on; regardless. They transport you, if only for a few moments, into another world, another place and\/or another time. Not many movies really do that for you, but for me, Disney animations do. The good ones, that is.I've yet to see a sequel of a Disney movie that was worth a penny of my money or a moment of my time. But in all fairness, I have yet to see Cinderella 2 and Lion King 2.The graphics in this instant classic are absolutely beautiful, as are the textures and color blends. As someone who does computer graphics for my own site, I am truly in awe of the Disney animators who did Lilo and Stitch and dozens of other Disney animations. I have one question though. Where the heck were they when the sequel was being made? Stitch is beautifully expressive both in animation and in voice. That's something you totally lose in the sequel. Lilo's face is also expressively drawn and animated, something else totally obliterated in the sequel.Also, I was very pleased that there were no Disney originals in the soundtrack. This soundtrack was dead ON for the movie. Thankfully, they didn't use the Beach Boys. Wow! What a difference THAT would've made! (and for the worse, I do believe.)This movie is wonderful entertainment, and instills a feeling of family, even when that family is self-made; self-adopted people you just find and take into your life.

The cast includes Jason Robards as a dying patriarch, Tom Cruise as Frank TJ Mackey, his estranged son, a sleazy womanizer who runs a seminar on how to use women. His golddigging Wife played by Julianne Moore, his male nurse(Philip Seymour Hoffman) who promises to find his son, a police officer(John C. Reilly), a cocaine addict, former game show contestant(William H. Macy) as well as a few i probibly forgot. Each of these people are at a crossroads in their life where they are unable to do anything without a little help from The Powers that Be.The film opens with three stories of chance and of coincedence, or so we are told. three amazing stories where if we saw something like that in a movie we would say that we wouldent believe it. but as the narrator stipulates, its not chance, things like this happen all the time. that is the basic theme and message. There is no such thing as chance, we all relate and meet for a reason beyond that. These three stories are presented as true but in reality, are false. In the same way, chance did not bring these 9 lives together but something higher up did.SPOILER ALERT in the end, when the act of divine intervention occurs and thousands of frogs pour from the sky, we are left a bit confused. And as said by the narrator in the beginning about the three amazing stories of chance, if this were in a movie i wouldent believe it to be true. but what we dont realize is that the end IS true. there have been several accounts, both historically and Biblically where frogs fall from the sky. The film even hints off to the book of Exodus. Historically, there have been accounts where frogs have fallen from the sky after a tornado or hurricane. But remember if i saw this in a movie, i wouldent believe it to be true. but we believed the three ficticious stories of chance dident we?Another explanation for the frogs(there are many) is that in ancient civilizations, frogs were used to judge the health of society. what better way to show just how healthy these people are than by a downpour of thousands of frogs.But the main message i feel Anderson was trying to get accross is that we all reach a point in our lives where we are unable to help ourselves, and we need a little help from The Powers that Be. This is where Divine Intervention comes into play. in short, God goes to extreme lengths to redeem you.The movie is beautiful, the soundtrack is amazing(who doesent LOVE Aimee Mann) and  the climax brings cold shivers down your spine.

There isn't a single remotely likeable character in the film, for one thing, and clearly wasn't meant to be. The camera ranges obsessively over such epiphenomena as nervous sucking at joints, the sheeplike conformity of a rock audience, the irritating infantilism of girl groupies and wannabe models having covered all this, it gives us the wonderful joke of a lignum crucis guitar fingerboard being first fought over, then quizzically cast aside as worthless. A world that's utterly rootless, without past or future or even any present purpose antiques (history, the past) are not the business to be in, says the impatient shop owner; the ragging students are collecting money for we know not what, perhaps for nothing at all; the Ban the Bomb march is pathetically small, ineffectual and incoherent. An eternal present, then, made habitable only by drugs and perhaps sex (wrestling on a paper bed?). This is the innocence from which Redgrave's fall from grace dramatically separates her (and perhaps, by extension, the protagonist, but we don't get to see this happening).

For anyone interested in the appeal of a traveling carnival, this film has some great sets.  The Funhouse also features some great Rick Baker\/Craig Reardon effects in the form of the movie's villain, a deformed albino with fangs and claws.But the rest of the production is sorely lacking.  Tobe Hooper does his best with the material, but he's not too good at smoothing over the obvious lack of logic inherent in the film.  For instance, the plot concerns a small group of four teenagers who decide on a lark to spend the night in the funhouse of the traveling carnival they're visiting...the same carnival that was around when those two girls were found dead in the woods some time ago.  Now, why on Earth would anybody in their right minds find the idea of staying in a carnival funhouse overnight exciting?  Where will they sleep?  What will they do the next day?  Won't they get hungry?  Thirsty?  Have to brush their teeth?  Use the bathroom?Not only that, but the attractions in this carnival are most definitely not of the transportable variety.  The titular dark ride seems so immense that our teen protagonists find it impossible to navigate their way out of the funhouse when danger rears its ugly head.  Here's an idea maybe follow the metal tracks in the floor until you are standing at the exit?  In fact, the funhouse is built like a permanent fixture, with at least two floors and what appears to be a sub-basement!  How would the carnies ever be able to dismantle this thing and move it in one day?This flick also suffers another blow by giving us nobody to root for.  The teenage protagonists are wholly unlikeable.  They smoke pot like they're sipping soda out of a can, they steal money from strangers, they are stupid enough to want to spend the night in a carnival attraction, and they commit the unpardonable horror movie sin of fornication--all except for the female lead, of course, although she isn't even interesting enough to be engaging.  The dialogue in the film is flat, and it has no success in establishing any characterizations on behalf of the would-be victims.  I wasn't even paying attention to most of the film's first reel.  The Funhouse is also one of those movies where the villains seem to know exactly where their victims will be standing, like directly on top of a trap door that is conveniently deployed right on cue.  The machinery of the funhouse also knows exactly how to deposit dead bodies so that they will stop exactly in front of our screaming victims.Suspension of disbelief aside, The Funhouse stirs up some uncomfortable feelings when the filmmakers use their monster to get scares out of the audience, then tell us he's simply deformed.  In reality, he is one of the only sympathetic characters in the movie, and the film's climax is the only portion that packs a wallop the script pits the only two characters in the film worth caring about against one another.Hooper throws in some sly references to Texas Chain Saw Massacre, even if it does involve the gratuitous and illogical use of swinging hooks (haw haw), but by the time the movie delivers any real shudders, it's too late.  Ironically, Dean Koontz was hired to write a movie tie-in novel for The Funhouse, which was published under the psuedonym Owen West.  Koontz fleshed out the story considerably, adding some great touches that the filmmakers would have been wise to exploit in their own movie.  Too bad, because Koontz's treatment may have given Hooper a bigger, sharper hook on which to hang this film.

Had the makers decided to be a little more sophisticated in their thinking and a little less crowd-pleasing in their actions, I would've given this a better rating.  3 out of 5 stars.

Kieslowski's movies are very different from the formulaic action movies that steer you firmly down a plotline, without giving the audience time to absorb any feeling. Without giving anything away, the story centres on the life of a young woman who experiences a great loss, and how everything changes, how she reacts, what happens next and much more. Music plays a central part in the plot and the scene where her finger traces the score as she shapes the symphony for Europe, is unforgettable. As you watch it you are lulled by the music yet also aware of the tension between her lover and her. Simply put, this film is subtle and moving, beautiful to watch, has a haunting musical soundtrack (I bought the CD as well, I have to say) and is never sentimental or cliched, not for a minute.

His contribution to the movie as a whole would have been much better spent actually developing his character more (feelings, motivations, etc) as opposed to the repeated attempts to portray him as a tough gangster which honestly I didn't really see. I never really even felt he was that much of a threat to Gal & company. Sure he was on the edge and clearly they were scared of him from whatever past experiences, reputation, etc, but please.

Now, Ray Winstone (retired thief Gary 'Gal' Dove) on the other hand, did a great job in his part of this movie, though I think that the script itself kinda let Ray down in that his character could have been more slick, expressed himself more about his reasons for not coming out of retirement, shown his skills more when the time for the heist actually came. Why was it so important for Gal personally to be in the heist when it seemed so simple anyone could have done it?

This meant that he sometimes made movies that puzzled his audiences, and several of them were out and out flops. But the passage of time has been kind to many of these movies which can be enjoyed for what they are, not what the audience WANTED them to be. 'The Trouble With Harry' is a great example. Many of Hitchcock's movies have humour in them, but an actual comedy was a bit left field for him. And not just any kind of comedy, a very black one. Humour is very subjective, but I found this movie to very clever and a lot of fun. It gets off to a bit of a shaky start with John Forsythe's character coming out with some unfunny lines and bits of business, but once the story kicks in and the characters played by Edmund Gwenn and Mildred Natwick are introduced, the movie becomes very amusing. Forsythe is technically the star of the movie, and Shirley MacLaine (in her movie debut) the leading lady, but Natwick, and especially Gwenn, steal the picture, and to me have the best lines. Edmund Gwenn was also in the underrated 1950s monster movie 'Them!', and I'm really fond of him. I also get a kick out of Royal Dano who plays the sheriff. Dano was a very interesting character actor who was in everything from 'Moby Dick' to 'Drum' to 'Killer Klowns From Outer Space'. To be totally honest 'The Trouble With Harry' wouldn't make it into my Top Ten Hitchcock movies, but that is only because he made so many great ones, and it's tough to choose, not because this is poor movie. If you want an edge of your seat thriller then maybe this isn't for you, but if you thought Hitch's droll introductions on his TV show were entertaining, then you should check this one out, as it's cut from the same cloth.

Dano was a very interesting character actor who was in everything from 'Moby Dick' to 'Drum' to 'Killer Klowns From Outer Space'. To be totally honest 'The Trouble With Harry' wouldn't make it into my Top Ten Hitchcock movies, but that is only because he made so many great ones, and it's tough to choose, not because this is poor movie. If you want an edge of your seat thriller then maybe this isn't for you, but if you thought Hitch's droll introductions on his TV show were entertaining, then you should check this one out, as it's cut from the same cloth.

This meant that he sometimes made movies that puzzled his audiences, and several of them were out and out flops. But the passage of time has been kind to many of these movies which can be enjoyed for what they are, not what the audience WANTED them to be. 'The Trouble With Harry' is a great example. Many of Hitchcock's movies have humour in them, but an actual comedy was a bit left field for him. And not just any kind of comedy, a very black one. Humour is very subjective, but I found this movie to very clever and a lot of fun. It gets off to a bit of a shaky start with John Forsythe's character coming out with some unfunny lines and bits of business, but once the story kicks in and the characters played by Edmund Gwenn and Mildred Natwick are introduced, the movie becomes very amusing. Forsythe is technically the star of the movie, and Shirley MacLaine (in her movie debut) the leading lady, but Natwick, and especially Gwenn, steal the picture, and to me have the best lines.

Unfortunately, I had never seen the entire movie, uncut, from beginning to end until I bought the DVD. And I have to say that I enjoyed it just as much as, if not more than, I did when I was a kid.The period in which this film was produced was conducive to movies made with an evident passion. This is a movie with more heart than nearly any big modern studio film you'd care to name. Yes, there are some holes (if I had Neville's arsenal and time, I'd sit on my balcony and snipe The Family until they were no more), but the story (and the music) more than makes up for it. Its flaws aside, this is a powerful story about a man under siege who finds a reason to live, and not just to survive.Certainly there are aspects to the movie that may be off-putting to modern viewers--the early-70s fashions, the too-good in-studio lighting, Neville's insistence on calling his female partner baby--but after Beyonce Knowles's Foxxy Cleopatra, at least Rosalind Cash's Black Power diva Lisa is funky fresh again. I am entirely unapologetic about my love for this movie, and yes, the ending still brings tears. The movies I saw during my formative years will always, no matter how good or bad, be special to me, and The Omega Man will forever rank as one of my all-time favorite movies, right up there with Silent Running and Voyage Into Space.

It is the best movie he made during the 80s though. The Shining is psychological Horror. This is Horror that gets under your skin. The film achieves this admirably, you watch it at 2 A.M. and see if you feel the same. The acting is mostly good in The Shining. The kid, cant remember his name, is very good. Scatman Carrothers is also quite good. Jack Nicholson got alot of bad reviews saying he overracted, but I do not feel he overracted. You know this guy really isnt that sane when you see him. My only criticism in the acting is Shelley Duvall, I kind of think she Overracted in areas.The Shining may seem very different from some of Kubrick's other movies. This is mostly because of the material. You still get a claustrophobic feel like in many other Kubrick movies. A viewer might think some questions are unanswered. Mostly asked would be the reason for the elevator of blood. The blood is more symbolizing something. That should be a pretty good hint.

Also there are a lot of scenes that were just plain wrong - the scene where he rode around with a bike at the campus happened in his early university years not after it. In my opinion Russell Crowe didn't fit to this part at all since he doesn't look the intelligent\/individualist type, therefore he really couldn't play one. It would have been great if it would have focused more on the mathematics (similar to Pi) and not the over-dramatized lovelife.
