The second one, in my opinion, was the crown jewel in the series.  I saw that one on opening night and it brought the house down.  Rarely have I ever laughed so hard at a movie.  I can't explain why, but the second AP movie is extremely funny, and almost is worthy of the title of comedic genius.  This entry, however, was a huge dispointment for many reasons.I, like many others on this site, got this as a Christmas present.  I was really excited to see it since I missed it in theaters and I loved the second one so much.  The simple truth is that this movie really isn't that funny.  The opening is hilarious with all of the cameos, but then, it just goes downhill.  There are a few scenes, however, that ARE laugh out loud hilarious, but they are few and far between, especially not what we would expect from an AP movie.  These scenes, too, are mostly borrowed and expanded upon from other 'sight' gags from the first two, which were extremely funny.  They're funny this time around, and are appropriately paid homage to, yet, when elaborations on existing jokes from previous sequels are the best part of a sequel, then something is terribly wrong.  There is no plot in this one, though the other two had razor thin plots, at least they were coherent.  This one, to me, made no sense.  It seemed like too many scenes were tacked together or not well thought out.  And the Goldmember character...totally not funny.  I know, it was a shocker to me too, since Dr. Evil, and yes, even Fat Bastard, to me, were both incredibly hilarious.  What was supposed to be funny about him?  The fact that he speaks crappy English?  The fact that he eats his own skin?  The fact that people keep making 'Stupid Dutchman' remarks?  The fact that the filmmakers thought we, the audience are too stupid and braindead to realize the difference between an inteligently played and scripted animated character, and a pathetic excuse for one?  I think the latter of the four questions holds the most merit.  And making Dr. Evil and Austin brothers? Congratulations!   You've officially ruined the franchise!  Yes, all of the old jokes and the times where Mini-Me gets the stuffing beating out of him weren't enough for them to ruin a good franchise, b\\c now, they totally ruined the rivalry between Austin and argulably one of the funniest villans in movie history.  Hopefully, they will read reviews like the ones on this site and NOT PURSUE an AP 4.  I'm sorry, but Seth Green is not much of an actor and just can't compare with being the bad guy like Dr. Evil can.Overall, a below average movie.  Why do I say this?  Comedies are supposed to be funny.  This is one of those movies that the producers knew that people would flock in droves to see just b\\c of the title rather than the content.  And they succeeded, since this movie made a boat-load full of cash.  This series has run its course and has officially kicked the bucket. What amazes me is that word of mouth (usually reliable with movies) did not prevent millions upon millions of devoted fans and moviegoers alike to be treated to 95 minutes of bordom and pure disapointment.  I rarely say this, but anyone who gives this movie better than average praise truly has no taste in movies.  Trust me, there are silly AND intelligent movies out there (Naked Gun, Airplane, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Blazing Saddles to name a few).  This movie, save for a totally wasted Michael Caine, is totally recycled from the previous two movies.  No originality at all.  At least the first two had a sense of class to them.  I am so shocked to see that this one has a 6.5 rating on IMDB!  Maybe there truly is no hope left for Hollywood being able to dish out good movies anymore.  For those of you who don't believe me, go ahead, I invite you to see for yourself who lame this one is, but if you do, make sure you rent it first and not buy it. If you made the same mistake as the person who got it for me did, you would be inadvertantly rewarding stupid and lethargic filmmakers who I know can do much better.  Shame on you, Mike Myers!  You have so much talent, and this is the best you can do?  Well, maybe the last laugh is on me, since I know this one made mad cash at the box office, but if we as a society keep rewarding mediocrity, then that is what we will always receive.  To be fair, I was thinking about giving it a 4\/10 since it did make me laugh really hard about three times, but that rating is truly pushing it mainly b\\c of the added disgust at knowing that I've been had and knowing that the filmmakers were capable, and compared to the previous two films, in a way, obligated to make a much better film.

There were never really any ghosts, but rather people just feigning as them.Major, major spoilers.Scooby Doo the movie is a terrible version of the old cartoons.  I'm not too familiar with the old series, but I know for sure that there were NEVER ghosts or hauntings or anything of the sort.  However, Scooby Doo the movie breaks into more foolish ground by changing all that, flinging the series into a sort of stupid science fiction fantasy movie.  We have large gremlin-looking creatures that want to take over the world (and they aren't masks), and PROTOPLASMS, which supposedly make up the soul of a human being.WRONG!  A protoplasm is the essential living thing inside a CELL.  Not a person.  Somebody didn't do enough research!  It was almost as if they used the word protoplasm just to sound cool.  Why, when a little bit of skimming through a dictionary will prove that you're a total idiot who hasn't done any research?Scooby Doo is a movie filled with assumptions, crummy jokes, and a really perverted Fred, who wasn't like that at all in the series.  The mystery is so lame that no clues were needed to solve it.  It was just WHAM! and the bad guy came out of hiding.One part I did like, though, was when the whole group entered the haunted castle.  It was rather thrilling for a moment, while the axes were swinging, the roller coaster was blasting forward, and Shaggy and Scooby were stuck on a wall.  The music was really good, too, I think.  But that's about the only good thing about the entire movie.Scooby Doo was one of the worst CGI characters I have ever seen.  They might have done better with a real dog, and not some plastic-looking CGI dog that could walk like a human.  I understand the original Scooby could, but that was the original, and it was a cartoon.  This is much different with live action.And the villain was so poorly introduced.  Even Count Dooku from Star Wars Attack of the Clones had a longer run time!  Scrappy was only seen for a few moments, and only from a story told by one of the characters.  And then he showed up in the end... how stupid!  I'm sorry, but this movie was lacking in depth from every single angle.One other good thing about it, though, is the friendship between Shaggy and Scooby.  Those actors were PERFECT for the roles.  Shaggy sounds just like the original.  I'm impressed.  The antics of Shaggy and Scooby help to lighten the movie and for a while I thought it would bring the movie back up.  But I was wrong.

There were never really any ghosts, but rather people just feigning as them.Major, major spoilers.Scooby Doo the movie is a terrible version of the old cartoons.  I'm not too familiar with the old series, but I know for sure that there were NEVER ghosts or hauntings or anything of the sort.  However, Scooby Doo the movie breaks into more foolish ground by changing all that, flinging the series into a sort of stupid science fiction fantasy movie.  We have large gremlin-looking creatures that want to take over the world (and they aren't masks), and PROTOPLASMS, which supposedly make up the soul of a human being.WRONG!  A protoplasm is the essential living thing inside a CELL.  Not a person.  Somebody didn't do enough research!  It was almost as if they used the word protoplasm just to sound cool.  Why, when a little bit of skimming through a dictionary will prove that you're a total idiot who hasn't done any research?Scooby Doo is a movie filled with assumptions, crummy jokes, and a really perverted Fred, who wasn't like that at all in the series.  The mystery is so lame that no clues were needed to solve it.  It was just WHAM! and the bad guy came out of hiding.One part I did like, though, was when the whole group entered the haunted castle.  It was rather thrilling for a moment, while the axes were swinging, the roller coaster was blasting forward, and Shaggy and Scooby were stuck on a wall.  The music was really good, too, I think.  But that's about the only good thing about the entire movie.Scooby Doo was one of the worst CGI characters I have ever seen.  They might have done better with a real dog, and not some plastic-looking CGI dog that could walk like a human.  I understand the original Scooby could, but that was the original, and it was a cartoon.  This is much different with live action.And the villain was so poorly introduced.  Even Count Dooku from Star Wars Attack of the Clones had a longer run time!  Scrappy was only seen for a few moments, and only from a story told by one of the characters.  And then he showed up in the end... how stupid!  I'm sorry, but this movie was lacking in depth from every single angle.One other good thing about it, though, is the friendship between Shaggy and Scooby.  Those actors were PERFECT for the roles.  Shaggy sounds just like the original.  I'm impressed.  The antics of Shaggy and Scooby help to lighten the movie and for a while I thought it would bring the movie back up.  But I was wrong.  It lost concentration less than halfway through.Attempts to modernize the movie were poor.  Acting was insufficient (other than Shaggy and Scooby).  Story and plot were crumbling to pieces at the beginning.  The music was decent in some parts, when no rock bands were trying to keep the teenager atmosphere with crummy lyrics and silly music.All in all, Scooby Doo was a total flop.  I'm not sure what happened.  But I know that even I could have done better.  Just by staying true to the cartoon could that have been accomplished.

As with the Toy Story series, the plot is taken from a what if? scenario in a child's imagination.  What if the monsters (whom everybody knows dwell in childrens' closets and under their beds) in fact live in a parallel world to ours? Monstropolis City is powered by energy garnered from children's screams, which are collected by the workers at Monsters Incorporated.  James P. Sullivan and his sarcastic assistant Mike are Monster Inc.'s top scarers, but when Sulley inadvertently lets a small girl into the monster world things start to go awry.  Monsters believe that human children are highly toxic, and in their efforts to put little Boo back where she came from, they uncover a fellow worker's sinister plan to revolutionise the scream-collection industry.One of the few down sides of the film is that at times it is just a little too cute, and Sulley definitely works best as a strong and straight-forward good-guy, as opposed to his attempts to be a moraliser and emotion-analyst.  His computer-generated fur though is incredible.  Over one million hairs have been animated to move realistically in response to anything from a light breeze to a Himalayan snowstorm.The concept of a factory that has an exact replica of every child's closet door, and that of monsters living in a world not all that dissimilar to ours is certainly clever; but it is also the little details - such as a Grossery Store and odorant (rather than deodorant) - which really make the movie.

The plot is ran during the end of 80s- beginning of 90s, so it was wrong to show Czechoslovakia giving a scholarship in aeronautics. The latter was always studied by Cubans in the former USSR but not in Prague. So it was wrong to include something here that may not happen at all.  2. If you do not like the Cuban government as it was the case of Gustavo's father, how can you have a big portrait of Fidel Castro in his house's hall? Nobody compels you to have a portrait of any Cuban leader in your house, this is up to you.  3. To me it is stupid to show someone getting HIV as a protest against the government. If you want to protest and to die for such a cause go to the street and do something more valuable against the regime, but do not kill yourself.  4. Gustavo was supposedly a good young communist but probably with a double standard of morale otherwise he would have not gone to eat leftovers in the restaurant where his father was playing  piano.
