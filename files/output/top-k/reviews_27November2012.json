Charlie's films will always stand out in the history of film making as he brought something new to the silver screen. City Lights is an exceptional silent film that showed the simplicity of romance and the length of ideology any one will go to keep it, from living a lie, to going to jail all in the name of love.The final scene in the movie has been sighted by many to be one of the greatest scenes in cinema history. I to accept that claim, the tramp's melancholy look as all the walls of lies fall apart will touch you in ways that will make you smile; the acting that followed it was masterfully done.Next to that scene my second favorite scene is the boxing fight, if you have not seen this movie before get ready for the laugh of your life, the screenplay is masterful, the acting is wonderful and the sound effects just enough. Such scenes make you wonder what Charlie movies would have been if he had all the gadgets and money that studios are pumping into movies this days.Like other Chaplin movies, this is a slapstick comedy done in 1931. He wrote produced and directed the movie. By the time of its release talkies were already in vogue (sound) but Chaplin took a shot in the dark making this movie a silent movie, he did fear though that the reception will not be good, but this movie did well in the box office and also was well received.The story plot as others is about the tramp (Charlie Chaplin) this time tramp meets and falls in love with a beautiful girl who happens to be blind.While the tramp was taking his leisure stroll he runs into a wealthy man, whom he befriended but the relationship was on and off, as the man will at times recognize Charlie and later forget that they know each other. The tramp on the other hand used his connection with the wealthy man to help his love as she was going through financial trouble.Holding the eleventh place in the AFI greatest film of all time, City Lights is one classic romantic comedy that will leave Charlie's name in the lips of many film goers for a long time.

Kubrick takes a run-of-the-mill Gothic horror story and infuses it with so many overtones, undertones and mind games that it's practically unrecognizable from Stephen King's book (which I have read, thank you, and is badly overwritten to the point of unreadability).Much has been written about various subtexts contained in The Shining, including Native Americans, child abuse, mirroring and subliminal messaging. A great resource is Rob Ager's Collative Learning website. I'm not sure I buy all of Ager's theories, but they are thought-provoking and well worth the time of anyone interested in this or Kubrick's other films. This much is certain Kubrick had much more in mind when making this film than just a guy who goes crazy one winter and tries to kill his family (one synopsis from SK himself).Take, for example, the compression of time and space. The cue cards take us from months to days, then hours, slowly ratcheting up our anticipation of some inevitable horror. Kubrick also makes excellent use (as always) of sound, as when Danny tours the Overlook in his Big Wheel, which moves from carpet, to wood floor, to carpet, to floor, in a rhythm which simulates a heartbeat. The scene in which Danny encounters the Grady girls at the end of the hallway imploring him to come play with us is simply the scariest damn scene in all of cinema; even after dozens of viewings, that scene makes my skin crawl.There are elements to The Shining that I admit I still don't understand. Why does Mr. Grady have two different first names? What was the guy in the bear suit doing? Why was this shining ability only good enough to bring Halloran to the Overlook, but not foresee Jack's axe? Most perplexing to me -- if relatively trivial -- is the function of Bill, who is not only present in several scenes but in the center of the frame? He has little to say, let alone do, in any of the scenes, leaving the viewer (this one at least) to wonder why he's in the movie at all.Nicholson's performance has been widely criticized as over the top and worse, yet I find it not only perfectly suited to the Jack Torrance character, but right up there with anything he's ever done. Shelley Duval went through hell making the picture (for evidence see the making-of doc by Kubrick's daughter on the DVD), but she is quite good. The scene where she's reading Jack's all work and no play pages, growing ever more distraught, is another highlight.As with all Kubrick films, The Shining must be seen several times to be fully appreciated.

Just what in a person's psyche makes them capable, willing and wanting to perform such heinous acts? Therefore, I've always liked films about serial killers, and always preferred those that were biographies and not fiction.OK, so I realize Henry was released 26 years ago, and that at the time it made a real serious impact on account of the scenes there that had been considered graphic and violent more than had ever been seen on screen. I realize that might have been the first time the audience was confronted with a real monster, a living murderer with no remorse and such a selective conscience. I also realize that Michael Rooker was (and still is!) one fine actor! And still, after watching this film today, I think it wasn't good at all.First of all, Michael Rooker was excellent as I said, but Tom Towles really wasn't, and Tracy Arnold was just terrible!

Where Bond was previously deadly, with the occasional twinkle in his eye, he was now dropping jokes left and right. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the comic moments in the Bond films, usually, but they are better in small doses.The film teases us with a return to form, as Bond is on a violent rampage to find Bloefeld. At first, we only here him as he assaults one contact after another. Then, we get a glimpse and it takes some of the wind out of the sales. Connery is noticeably older and softer, and his hairpiece isn't very convincing. Had that been a plot point, like in Never Say Never Again, it might not have been a detriment. Unfortunately, you are asked to accept that this is still the same man who fought brutal battles with the likes of Red Grant and Oddjob. That isn't helped when we see him getting his head handed to him by Bambi and Thumper, or having trouble with Wynt and Kidd.The film is played heavily for laughs, but still manages some great stunt sequences, though they are even more outlandish than before, with the car chase through Las Vegas and the moon buggy escape. The final assault on the SPECTRE oil platform returns to the form of YOLT, minus the ninjas.The cast is a bit more odd than in the past, starting with Jill St. John. She is definitely a different love interest, with a wisecracking tongue and more self-assured manner (it was the era of women's lib). Despite that, she really doesn't have much to do, apart from sleeping with Bond and waiting for rescue. Not quite up to Tracy's standards.Charles Grey is a definite poor choice for Bloefeld. He is quite charming and menacing, but Bloefeld has been previously introduced as a cold hearted mass murderer; a calculating killer. Grey has too much of a sense of humor and would have been better suited to play a new villain. The character goes beyond recovery once he appears in drag.As for the rest of the cast, they are pretty forgettable, apart from Jimmy Dean's drawl and Lana Wood's presence. Wynt and Kidd never seem that scary, just weird. It's a shame, as Bruce Glover could have been a real psycho with a better script to work from.The film is pure farce, but at least it's fun. Unfortunately, there was no going back from this formula for years. Even the more serious films, like For Your Eyes Only and Goldeneye, suffer from jokey stunts, with things at their worst under Roger Moore (at least he was at home with the comedy).

As much as I do like the new Marc Webb Amazing Spider Man (2012) - It takes much too long to get into it, although the character development in that film is very good.In this film however, the character development continues through the film and is incorporated even into action sequences, Continuing up to the very last frame of the film.Ted Raimi, Bruce Campbell and Dan Hicks (Of Dan Hicks and his Hot Licks) are all inserted as cameo properly as with any Raimi film. It is Campbell himself who names Spider-man - Saying The Human Spider? That Sucks!My few complaints revolve around the character of Peter Parker, who is fairly unlucky in the books, here he is a walking disaster area. He is the antithesis of The Competent Man and even when given extraordinary ability, he is still a wimp in his personality, especially in his dealing with Mary Jane Watson. Also, Peter Parker's first Love interest was Gwen Stacy, and it was she, not MJ who The Green Goblin captured and gave Spidey the choice Save these kids in the Cable-Car, or Save Gwen. It was a choice, and one or the other only could have been saved. Here, Gwen is absent totally, and he saves MJ with a feat even impossible for the comic- book rendition of Spidey.But I suppose adding Gwen to the mix would have muddied up the water too much. And even though I did not like the distortion of that original classic story, they did reproduce it visually with astounding correctness, as they did with the images of Spider-Man flying through NYC. Animating several classic Steve Ditko Spidey Postures, and at the end of the film we get to see many of these animated fantastically.But the main message 'With Great power, comes Great Responsibility - As told by Uncle Ben to Peter right before his death, survives, and when coupled to Danny Elfman's main Theme, makes this a powerful, meaningful film.

Moore had been a contender when Connery left the first time, but was committed to the Saint. The Saint made him an international star and showcased his talents for action and comedy. He brought those talents here, for good and bad. With Moore in the role, we could say goodbye to the cool killer of the early Connery films. Now, we would get a lot more jokes, but they were somewhat compensated by bigger stunt sequences.The film is a pretty mixed bag. It starts out with a bang, as we see agents knocked off left and right, with horrific voodoo-inspired trappings. We are introduced to our new Bond in bed, establishing that Moore's Bond still enjoys the ladies. Then we see that gadgets will be everywhere and too many will exist for gags. We also get an attempt to cash in on the Blaxploitation boom, complete with racist trappings. Jane Seymour is a welcome surprise and Yaphet Kotto has moments, but they are too often undercut by bad comedy.Now, the film isn't all bad. The theme song, from Paul McCartney, is one of the best in the series. Felix Leiter gets a lot more to do here and is ably played. The speedboat chase is brilliant and there are many memorable lines. Many is the time I have quoted Sheriff JD Pepper's, Secret Agent? On whose side? Pepper actually serves a purpose here and is pretty entertaining. The henchmen Tee-Hee has some outstanding scenes, such as his introduction of the alligators and crocodiles to Bond, and the story of how he got his mechanical hand. The gator farm has some real menace to it, just as the island scenes have some real horror. Jane Seymour is fantastic as Solitaire, Kananga's seer and Bond's love interest. Yaphet Kotto is great as Kananga, both charming and menacing, in the grand tradition of Goldfinger and Largo. Moore handles the role well, deftly moving from comedy to action without missing a beat. In all, the good outweighs the bad; but, the bad is pretty heavy.The racial elements are pure stereotype and are sad to see. Kananga is undercut by appearing as Mr. Big and his death is beyond silly. His henchmen, apart from Tee-Hee, aren't exactly the cream of the crop. Whisper? Really? The villains shouldn't exist for fat jokes. The central plot of drug smuggling seems a bit beneath Bond, however topical it might have been. When you have stopped nuclear holocausts and World War III, a drug baron is small time. Finally, Kananga's scheme seems a bit overly complex for something as simple as drug running. It definitely feels like the script was the product of a committee, rather than the evolution of a good idea.In the end, the film mostly succeeds in entertaining that you can forgive its shortcomings. Moore proves to be good as James Bond, albeit a different kind of Bond. He would carry the franchise for over a decade and to huge box office and his films got better. It's still better than Diamonds are Forever, but I actually think OHMSS is vastly superior. It's a rough start, but it would pan out.

After The Spy Who Loved Me, we had been promised For Your Eyes Only, but instead we got Moonrake. Why? Because it has space, sort of, in the title. The original novel was about a Nazi with an ICBM. That was then, ICBMs were old news after Cuba. So, let's launch James Bond in a space shuttle, before Nasa had even done so.The film starts out oddly, with the hijacking of a space shuttle. This requires a bit of suspension of disbelief, as it is unlikely that a space shuttle would be carrying any fuel, while being transported on the back of a 747. So, we turn off our brain and move on to Bond. He seems to be returning home when he is set up to die in a crashing aircraft. What follows is an amazing aerial sequence that includes the return of Richard Kiel's Jaws. As the film moves on, it is mostly in good form, with menace around every corner and more than a bit of mystery. Unfortunately, it starts coming apart at the seams when the comedy takes over. Just as things seem to be building to something big, we get the ridiculous gondola chase through Venice and a double-take from a pigeon. Add to that a turn from menacing to comical for Jaws and you have the makings of a big disappointment. Once things go into space, they never recover.The cast is rather uneven. Michael Lonsdale is excellent is Drax, a cold, ruthless maniac. His assassin Chong is up there with the likes of Oddjob. However, Lois Chiles is totally unconvincing as Dr. Goodhead, a name straight out of a porno. Richard Kiel proved popular as Jaws and returns to early menace; but once a love interest for him is introduced, he never recovers.The film really could have worked if they had stuck with the stronger elements. The scenes in Drax's mansion and testing facilities are great, as are those in the glass museum and the Amazon. The locales of Venice and Rio are used well, and the mystery of the deadly liquid is very intriguing. The space station is another matter, as are the jokes. It would have been more believable that Drax had built the complex with NASA's knowledge, though he hid its true purpose. Perhaps it was intended as a weapons platform, or a lab, ala Skylab. Drax then hides his deathsattelites onboard, ready to rain death upon the land. Drax and his followers would then be isolated in the Amazon, in bunkers, waiting for the virus to finish its job and expire. Instead, we are left to believe that he built this massive complex with neither NASA's or the Russian's knowledge. It makes the volcano lair of SPECTRE look like an average real estate venture.So, despite a promising start, we are left with a battle in space. I suppose it's in keeping with the tradition of ninja commandos attacking a volcano base, or scuba commandos battling beneath the ocean, but it looks far less believable. Then we get the same gag at the end, with Bond's version of coitus interruptus, as we saw in TSWLM. It pretty much signaled that any attempt at a serious film was over, for now.

Almost all I've seen have the same plot, where an innocent is persecuted for some crime and must spent their time running from the law while trying to find the culprit. Just too predictable, so I got to rather focus in their technical aspects artistic virtuosity, cinematography, pacing, plot development; shot frame and composition, lightning, acting, while getting little in what is really important to me overall substance, depth of ideas, originality, purpose; intellectual or philosophical reach or value. They are mostly for entertainment, as Hitchcock said himself, and that's not enough for me. If I review IC now is because this is the first one where I see something sorely lacking in the others psychological depth.IC is about a Catholic priest who receives the confession of a murderer and who becomes himself the murder suspect later, but who can't reveal to police who the culprit is, because of his vows. His plight is further complicated by the fact that the victim was blackmailing the woman with whom he had a romantic relation before his ordainment. What's different in this Hitchcock is that characters aren't just playing parts here&#x97;the murderer, the suspect, the detective--but also showing the complexity of their dilemmas, the tangled web of their conflicting emotions--Pierre Grandfort, for ex., who must live with the knowledge that his wife doesn't love him, while having to help her saving the man she loves. Or Father Logan, who may be well be facing the death penalty, with the only escape possibility being in him violating the sanctity of the Confessional. Or Ruth, who sees herself in the heartbreaking dilemma of destroying her husband's promising political career, to save Father Logan, or leaving the priest to his fate.Now, this is not a great movie but one I found interesting for the intensity of the characters, as I said. The trademark Hitchcock camera is there, making the best of every tourist spot in Quebec City. The acting is appropriate, especially by the leads. Malden totally at home as a detective&#x97;the man was born to play the role&#x97;Hasse effective as the murderous weasel but Haas much overplaying her part--she's soo touching (considering what German women had to go through during the post-war, living in caves, clearing millions of tons of rubble with their bare hands, it's ridiculous that Otto would make such a fuss of Alma doing simple house chores.) About Baxter, I had the weird feeling her character had just been tacked there but she plays it decently anyway. About Monty, I don't know if that is intensity or simply that he can't act. In each scene I remember having seen him in others movies he looks and acts the same way, his eyes and eyebrows doing all the work--which is not strange anyway, considering he was always there doing the role of a victimized man. (Lack of acting opportunities or just a very limited dramatic range?).But the one thing I really hated in this flick is Keller. He is a coward hypocrite, a traitor; but even worse is that he was made a German, which suggests that good old Alfie was simply getting even for the V1s that may have landed on his roof a few years earlier. Being Germans, the Kellers had no business in Quebec City of the 50s. I wasn't here at the time but I know that the Canadian govt. has historically tried to settle refugees in places where already exists an established community to provide them with the appropriate cultural and social environment. B.C. does it for Orientals; Quebec for the French and Central Canada for Eastern Europeans. So, as soon as they had landed in Canada, real life Kellers would have taken a train to Winnipeg, to Saskatoon, where they would have met their kin in local German communities. They wouldn't have spent one day in Q.C. where even today you'll find precious few people speaking anything other than French. But good old Alf had to get that one off his chest.Now, what I find ironic about IC is that, while probably being the most interesting Hitchcock I've seen is also the one with the biggest plot holes. Just consider the big coincidence that Keller would have decided to rob Villette the same night when Villette's blackmailing affair had reached a boiling point. Also amazing that it should be Father Logan the priest to take his confession. There are also inconsistencies in his behavior. We come to know him as a rat, ready to lie, to betray, to frame with the murder the priest who helped him so much, to shoot his way out of trouble, yet he feels terrible because he has killed a man by accident; so bad, he has to tell someone, a priest. It doesn't make sense. Also that Larrue, being as acquainted at the uses of the Catholic Church as he says he is, would act in such ignorant and reckless way as to suspect Father Logan of involvement in the murder just because he was so reserved about the motive of his visit to the victim. Had he never noticed the great discretion with which priests usually treat matters concerning privacy of the faithful? Even weirder is that he would start suspecting Logan as soon as he sees him meeting a woman outside Villette's house. What that means as evidence? As the result he doesn't come out as if he was trying to solve the crime but rather as if trying to pin it on Logan. Why for ex. after hearing the girls' tale he doesn't even consider the possibility that the murderer could have been a man disguised as a priest, as it was the case?.In all, not a great film but one of the few Hitchcocks I have watched with real interest, along with Strangers On A Train and Vertigo. 6.5\/10.

The film was very good constructed and formed for that time, it was a new type of genre in the film industry, the beginning of horror in the film history and still is one of the best horror films ever made. We get a good impression of how it happened and we can really find ourself in the movie. The film maker wanted the people to really think about the film and used good techniques for this. He gave the characters a lot of emotion and made the movie sad in some aspects, of course the main sad part is about Regan, but also father Karras is very sad because he lost his mother. This made the movie better and it helped to keep the watcher's attention throughout the film. Overall this film is good.

This is no grandiose story about megalomaniacs out to launch nuclear or biological holocausts, or drug lord heads of state. This is a tale of revenge and a search for vital technology, the stuff of real spies.The film takes its plot from two Fleming short stories, For Your Eyes Only and Risico. The former is a tale of a young woman's attempt at revenge, which leads her to cross paths with Bond. The later is a tale of smugglers and double-crosses. Both mesh extremely well and give us a Bond story that is more down-to-earth than our last outing, literally! The comedy is kept to a relative minimum and the danger is upped.The cast is mostly good. Julian Glover and Topol are welcome additions, elevating the acting level from recent outings. Carole Bouquet is serviceable, with beautiful haunting eyes. She is just believable enough as the vengeance seeking woman. The one character that doesn't work is Bibi. She just serves to illustrate how old Roger Moore is getting and turns her scenes into a sad Lolita wannabe.The stunts never get too outlandish, helping to maintain the sense of realism. They are also in service to the plot, not just inserted into the script.Thankfully, comedy is mostly kept to the Q briefing, which has become a staple of things under Moore (even more than they did in the later Connery films). Unfortunately, one bit of comedy undermines what should have been a deadlier moment. In the teaser, we are led to believe that Bond is being attacked by Bloefeld, on the anniversary of Tracy's death (we can assume that is why Bond is visiting her grave). I say led to believe because EON couldn't legally use Bloefeld anymore. Still, the bald head, injured body, menacing voice, and Tracy's grave all scream Bloefeld. So, in what appears to be the final confrontation, Bond is making jokes, and bad ones at that. This is the man who killed his one true love and he is cracking corny jokes? Nope, not buying that. Thankfully, the rest of the film is removed from that.So, we finally get a mostly serious Roger Moore Bond and it works! It has great stunts, but they serve a purpose. It has a fine cast of actors, with one or two exceptions. It has a mystery to keep the plot moving and the unique feature of the singer of the theme song appearing in the title sequence (a song which won an Oscar). It was a welcome change from the bulk of Moore's previous efforts.
