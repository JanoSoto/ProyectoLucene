It must attack a hill occupied by Japanese soldiers.  You now know the entire plot of THE THIN RED LINE, and yes, it is every bit as boring as it sounds.THE THIN RED LINE is subject to the same critique as THE PHANTOM MENACE it's nobody's story.  Most of the characters (with two merciful exceptions) are boring and literally interchangeable; more than one reviewer has confused one character with another.The voice-over narration consists of maundering banalities disguised as philosophy.  At one point one of the G.I. narrators (who?  who knows or cares?) mumbles, Who's killing us?  The Japanese soldiers are killing you, of course!  And you're killing them!  What could be more obvious or banal? Another pompously suggests that all humans are part of one universal soul. Are we seriously to believe that two men such as Col. Tall and Cap. Staros, with such different outlooks on life and diametrically opposite reactions to violence, have the same soul?Oddly for a movie so obsessed with imagery (particularly of the lush jungle), THE THIN RED LINE consistently tells us what is happening to the characters, rather than showing us.  Officers beg for water for their men, lest the poor sods pass out, but we never see a soldier pass out or even gulp the last drip from a canteen.  Show us, Malick!  Show us the crusted salt dried on the baked skin of a man who has no water left in his body for sweat!  Show us the field surgeon losing his ability to care what happens to the men, don't just have him tell us about it!  Show us Arnold Schwarzenegger getting blown to pieces while Rick Moranis survives, don't give us a line like, No matter how strong or well trained you are, if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time, you're going to get it. Show us what's happening to the people, not to the !@#$% papaya tree!The movie is also scandalously inaccurate.  Any war veterans in the audience will giggle to see two dozen Japanese voluntarily surrender to Company C alone.  In reality, Japanese soldiers were almost never captured alive, and when they were it was usually because they were too badly hurt to resist further.  Even worse is the portrayal of the native Solomon Islanders, who are made out as living a serene and peaceful life untouched by the war. In fact, the natives of Guadalcanal were very unhappy about being invaded by the Japanese, and made crucial contributions to the American victory by carrying water, ammunition and other supplies to the troops, rescuing American wounded, and as coastwatchers warning the G.I.'s of attack by air or sea.  All of this was at great risk to their lives.  The movie's treatment of them as passive flower children is inaccurate, patronizing and downright insulting.  Also, the idea of a soldier with multiple AWOL offenses not being court-martialled is absurd.  This is World War II, when they shot Private Slovik for desertion.In all fairness, the cinematography is breathtaking.  Also, the acting is uniformly high-quality, with Nick Nolte as Col. Tall and Elias Koteas as Cap. Staros providing very strong performances, especially considering the weakness of the script they had to work with.  The battle scenes are kinetic, giving you the feeling you are charging alongside the troops, and they manage to convey some pathos despite the film's refusal to let us connect with the characters.  Only these elements save THE THIN RED LINE from being a total loss.Bloody but detached, contemplative but witless, visually beautiful but emotionally dead, THE THIN RED LINE is not worth renting.  Hard-core film buffs might want to watch it on TV for the acting and for John Toll's flawless cinematographic technique.Rating  ** out of ****.

Sorry to entirely break with tradition, but I thought little of the 1935 version; there's no denying it's full of remarkable talent but I just felt it was too faithful to the novel. Ditto, in a way, the musical, despite the fact that it took a number of liberties.Now, here's where I commit heresy - this abridgement of the book is better than *any* other adaptation out there.  It also loses a number of the overly pretentious afflictions the book suffers from (notably the death scene). What a number of other people have said is that it doesn't compare to the book.  I have read the book, and make no mistake, I consider it to be among the best ever written.  But it is too long and suffers from notable flaws - the disappearance of the two major protagonists for excessively long periods of narrative; Thénardier (I won't apologise for that, since his character could be well enough done without - see the musical for proof of his annoyance factor - so kudos to the screenwriter for simply editing him out of most of the movie); and decentralisation.  The story is about redemption, yes, but it is also about the relentless pursuit by Javert and the endless flight by Valjean.  The book never quite manages to bring together these opposing strands.  Most adaptations have unsuccessfully tried to juggle both strands and have failed (occasionally as spectacularly as the book itself does).  The film concentrates mainly on the pursuit, and frankly it is all the better for it.The Valjean we see in this film is already a redeemed character by the time we run into him in Vigau.  He is incredibly compassionate and quite obviously transformed from our first impressions of him in the scenes at the bishop's house.  To all the naysayers - this is why Valjean punches the bishop - to better show his redemption when we jump nine years into the future.  It is effective.  A single act of kindness has transformed the man - we see that the second we next come into contact with him.  But despite his transformation, the violent streak in him still comes to the fore on occasion - witness smashing Javert's head against a wall, and slapping Cosette.  The book unconvincingly portrays a man completely altered from his fundamental nature - I'm sorry, but I just don't buy that.  Violence is still there, and it can be suppressed, but not always.  Sometimes it erupts, given enough provocation.  Reasonable enough, I think.Javert is shown as completely uncompromising and certain of his moral stature, but we see towards the end that he wavers.  Just as in with Valjean, a single act of mercy changes the man.  But, unlike Valjean, he is unable to reconcile that change - it makes a seeming mockery of the way he has lived his entire life.  This is effectively portrayed, and having Valjean there to witness it is ultimately what takes this film far away and above all previous adaptations.  The scene is cold and sterile without extra human contact.  Javert is obviously a cold man, and the presence of Valjean adds some much-needed warmth to the final scene.  It gives it extra resonance.And, to everyone out there who loves the book - the faux-spirituality in the death scene is quite simply absurd.  It is pretentious and somewhat out of line with the rest of the story.  Yes, Valjean is a good Christian man, and he trusts in the Lord.  But, an intelligent reader (or, in the case of the movie, viewer) does not need quite so blatant an exhibition of his redemption.  As any English teacher will tell you - implication is better than exhibition.  Apparently a lesson Hugo did not learn, looking at his other novels.For me, what makes the movie is not the beautiful score, the brilliant adaptation, the lush photography, or even the terrific acting.  It is the final scene.  It is truly beautiful.  Look closely at the entire film and you will notice that Valjean only smiles twice.  The first time is with Fantine, and it is only briefly - in this brief expression we see his love for Fantine, something he was unable to ever show her, since in repressing his violent side and dedicating his life to humanitarianism, Valjean had had to some extent disconnect his emotions.  He never shows Fantine his true love, and it crushes him - it is worsened by the fact that he brings up her daughter.  And, of course, Valjean can never be truly happy because he can never feel truly safe.  Every second, on every corner, Javert could be waiting.  Valjean can never let go of that fear.SPOILER!But, at the end of the film, as Javert throws himself into the river, Valjean looks stunned.  But, as he walks along the banks of the Seine, the sheer enormity of what has happened dawns upon him and we see his face slowly break into a great smile.  At last he is free, at last he is safe. It is inspiring and breathtaking.  This is what the book should have been like.  Make no mistake.  Beautiful.

Imagine how devastating that must have been. My husband makes miniature model airplanes.  We have quite a collection of those cute little planes. Every airplane is well researched as my husband goes to National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.  He is very interested in the Pacific Theater - a war buff!  He also corresponds with several veterans. It is really adorable. He loves war movies.  I tend to fall asleep watching them, unfortunately,  but I try to stay awake and understand.

While not a terrible film, MYSTERY is often lacking in so many areas and ideas, it's hard to love it.Taking place in the small icy town of Mystery, the story concerns a commonwealth who's main concerns are knit caps and who will play in the community's weekly Saturday hockey game.

This comment is limited to 1,000 words - I would need a limitless page to explain why. But I will say this. The Titanic represented everything that the people of 1912 hoped that this century would be like. It represented the illusion that we had finally conquered nature. But we were wrong. When Billy Zane says, 'It is unsinkable - God himself could not sink this ship' - you can almost see, high above the clouds, God saying 'Oh yeah? We'll see about that!' Titanic - the movie - is not only a mesmerising, beautifully made, heart-wrenching, uncompromisingly realistic film, but it is a true meditation on not only mankind's progress through this century (which began at the end of the gilded age and is now finishing at the dawn of the digital age), and on the human condition itself. James Cameron, having established himself as the action maestro with Aliens and T2, finally proved not only that he was willing to totally defy and redefine the auteur theory, to ignore the cynics and the unfathomable opinions of people who think that A Night to Remember is the definitive account of the disaster (calling planet earth, do you think that on a sinking ship without enough lifeboats for everyone, everything would be done in a smooth, cool, calm, orderly fashion? Eh?), and forget about codes, conventions and 'film theory', in order to make the film the way he saw fit, but that he is a human being. When Steven Spielberg made Schindler's List (in my opinion the #2 film of all time), it was a big break, considering among other things the fact that he had just finished Jurassic Park, but he had made real human dramas before - The Color Purple and Empire of the Sun. Cameron had shown that action movies could have real production values, but a true human drama was a totally new thing. The film HAD to be made before this century was out. I was only two when Cameron's big break - The Terminator was released, but I can imagine a lot of people thinking that this man would be the one to make THE Titanic movie (technology versus mankind, anyone?). As well as the powerful messages (more than you're likely to find in a state-of-the-art digital communication system), the film has unchallengably breathtaking grandeur, awe-inspiring beauty, an excellent cast, a moving storyline, and totally absorbing AND thought-provoking entertainment. When Cameron and fellow producer Jon Landau received the Best Picture Academy Award last year, the final moment was the moment Cameron had been building up to throughout his career. He summarised what the film meant to him, and spoke as human being, not as a Hollywood director, when he called for a moment's silence in honour of the 1,500 men, women and children who went down with the ship. By faithfully recreating the disaster and giving it mass appeal in uncountable ways, Cameron has made a document of the human condition, the 20th century and what it brought about, and social, moral and technological progress that will surely stand the test of time, and, maybe, one day, when those snobbish critics have a 'live life to the full, you never know when it could end' experience, will make them realise that Citizen Kane (excellent but overrated) is NOT the greatest film ever made. But then, we are all human beings, and we are all different, and the right to freedom of expression is a right we all should have - one of the film's many messages. Perfect freedom does not exist, but we can be free from oppression if we let other people and exterior forces work with us. In Titanic, the ship in question represents Rose's gilded cage, and the limitations of her society, but, ultimately, it (she, sorry) becomes her means of salvation - both in that it\/she brings her to Jack, and in that it\/she sinks, therefore changing the lives of all the survivors. Dramatic license works its wonders in the scene when Jack and Rose go up on deck having just been 'doing it' in the car, Rose decides that she is going to forsake her money and her family and get off at New York with Jack, she kisses him, the lookouts look down and see them - but when they look ahead, what do they see? The rest is history. Although many critics were critical of this film, the fact that it is both the most popular AND the most honoured film of all time is a testimony to the value we place upon our freedom, and upon life itself. Not a day goes by when I don't think about the awesome wonder of that film, neither will I ever forget how it changed my life. Every time I watch it I notice something new. James Cameron is the greatest artist in the history of mankind. Dedication, passion and commitment were taken to new levels with Titanic. I could go on forever, you know!

Wyler places her illuminated face at the furthermost left of the screen, with nothing but black to the right it's very effective, especially after three hours of detailed panorama.  On TV this is just another dull close-up.  By a hundred subtle transformations of this kind is Wyler's breathtaking work turned into stodge.This is particularly fatal because Ben-Hur had some tendency towards stodge to begin with.  The portentous reminders of the divinity of Christ (`He says - he says he IS doing his father's work') are far too many and all of them stage-bound - and what do they REALLY have to do with the story of Ben-Hur, anyway?  Even without the Christianity, Wyler leads us through each scene rather as if the story were some kind of museum exhibit.Only on the big screen does it emerge that this latter feature is a virtue rather than a vice.  After all - at least it's a museum exhibit we're allowed time to contemplate.  Had the film been made today we would have been hustled through in half the time, a long queue of impatient patrons behind us, none of us getting a good look at anything and all of us feeling short-changed.

The original movies were pretty stupid, I have to admit, but they were fun-stupid.  The new film is just DULL.And the plot is a big problem.  For a start we have a Trade Federation.  This is not nearly as scary as an Evil Empire, I'm sorry but it just isn't.  Yikes!  Here come the delegates from the Evil Trade Federation!!!  See?!?  It just doesn't work.  It's like Beware the dreaded Agriculture Commission!! or something.  The plot is supposed to be for kids, but unfortunately it seems to have quite a high Daddy?

Kind of like Luke Skywalker in Return of the Jedi.  When Luke became a Jedi knight he suddenly became Enigmatic for which we can read Dull and Awful.  I thought this was merely down to bad acting on Mark Hamill's part in Jedi, but no - because Liam and Ewan are JUST as Enigmatic in this new film.  At certain parts in the movie I thought I spotted Ewan's natural exuberance bubbling over, but at those points George obviously yelled Cut!!! and poked Ewan with his directorial cattle prod.  The end result is that both actors look like they have had their charisma surgically removed.Then there's Queen Amidala.  She is a very different kind of royalty to Princess Leia who was kind of spunky.  Amidala is Regal.  Unfortunately George ALSO equates Regal with Dull and Awful.  Also she seems to have gone to the same finishing school as Queen Elizabeth and as such delivers all her lines with the same passion.Then we have the kid.  Having small children in films is always a dangerous move.  It's not their fault, they are just by nature irritating creatures who can't act (with the exception of Bart Simpson).  Eventually CGI will have improved to the state where all children will be played by far more charismatic special effects, but for the moment George was lumbered with an Annakin Skywalker with the emotional range of a turnip.

He didn't even look close to being dischuffed, the scene was completely bungled.  Yes, yes, I know he's not a normal child - he's got a high medichlorien count or something (I think it's a bit like cholesterol) and he's causing a divergence in the force - but all the same, it's hard to care for young Anni.On to Jar-Jar.  A lot of people hate this character, and I was surprised I didn't really.  It's not that he isn't annoying, just that he isn't unbearable either.  I mean, C3PO was a lot worse.

Grace Kelly is a terrible actress, but she doesn't even have the crutch of her legendary beauty here, as her humiliation goes hand in hand with increasing dowdiness.  And yet the film is a must-see not only because every Hitchcock film is rich in style and meaning, but for two cherishable performances from Ray Milland and John Williams; for an extraordinary, abstract courtroom scene; and for a remarkable play with theatrical metaphors.Robin Wood sees many Hitchcock films as analyses of marriage, and DIAL M FOR MURDER is no exception.  Even from the beginning we know there's something wrong with the Wendice union - the opening clench is theatrical, cold, unreal.  The family home is not comforting, but made strange objects don't blend in, but are threateningly present (lamps, drinks bottles etc.), always getting in the way of human communication (the telephone is an apt metaphor for the crisis in the film).  In a traditional detective story, it is through the displacement of ordinary items, taken for granted, that marks a rupture - the everyday becomes frightening.Wendice is unable to satisfy his wife - he is only interested in her money. when he talks to Swan about his marital difficulties, he walks with a cane, ostensibly a fake prop, but a clear hint of the impotence rejected when he drops it and talks of the murder that will reassert his patriarchal role. He is like a servant in his own home, dependent on his wife, serving her and her lover drinks.  He is probably gay - the handbag which has been transferred in association from his wife to him, is made the butt of a homophobic jibe by Inspector Hubbard.Most importantly, the conjugal home resembles a stage set.  This is the governing motif of the film.  Hitchcock subverts the hokey sentiments and values of Knott's play, by drawing attention to its staginess.  Props are foregrounded; Wendice is clearly a stage director\/author who is putting on a play (planning the murder of his wife).  He talks to Swan like he's a director instructing an actor, giving him his lines, showing him round the stage, telling him what to do, where to move; crucially, giving him his cue, timing, the 'call'.However, although Wendice seems in control, the gaze of the film does not belong to him - his authority is already undermined long before his plot unravels.  Frequently filmed in distanceng wide angle, this scene with Swan is shot from above, spied on from a seemingly unmotivated, godlike position, which only emhasises the unreality (theatricality) of the sequence.  There is another author beyond Wendice, who is really running the play.  Is it God?  Fate?  Hubris?  This position of authority is jostled for by the four male characters, in a frequently homoerotic manner.The only time this kind of shot becomes motivated, it belongs to the Inspector, suggesting that the law is the godlike arbiter, from whom nothing can be hidden.  And this is true, but not reassuring the Inspector is cold and detached; but, more unforgiveably, like the other male characters, two of whom tried to murder her, he sadistically inflicts pain on Mrs. Wendice, pushing her out of the story, in effect succeeding where Wendice and Swan failed; she is absent for most of the film's second half.  The law is shown to be both frightening and whimsical, rather like an Old Testament God. This is not comforting.This link between the author and authority, both trying to shape meaning, and 'create' truth, while in reality concealing it (Hubbard's assertion of patriarchal truth denies Mrs. Wendice's emotional reality) is linked to a story which is invoked in the film's opening MacGuffin, the stolen letter. Poe, a favourite of Hitchcock's, wrote 'The Purloined Letter' about a missive stolen by a respectable government minister, form a Queen possibly enjoying an adulterous relationship.  What's written in this letter, and who controls it, becomes a site of power between the two male characters, who squeeze out the female character, who owns it, altogether.  Knowledge, authority, power, and the artist are linked, all are abused, all are stolen from women.  Mrs. Wendice's absence in the middle of the film is the anguish seething behind the film's (or play's) smooth mechanics.  Anyone who thinks Hitchcock is just a technician is an idiot.  he had a profound grasp on the workings of society, and how people are sacrificed for it.He also shows the seductive appeal of power - Wendice is suave, hilarious, imperious, mandarin, the motor of the film, a joy to watch, and yet an automaton.  Hubbard's victory over him relies on Wendice's working like clockwork.  The author was really only an actor, parroting perfectly his fed lines.  It's significant that it should be a real author who exposes him.

Grace Kelly is a terrible actress, but she doesn't even have the crutch of her legendary beauty here, as her humiliation goes hand in hand with increasing dowdiness.  And yet the film is a must-see not only because every Hitchcock film is rich in style and meaning, but for two cherishable performances from Ray Milland and John Williams; for an extraordinary, abstract courtroom scene; and for a remarkable play with theatrical metaphors.Robin Wood sees many Hitchcock films as analyses of marriage, and DIAL M FOR MURDER is no exception.  Even from the beginning we know there's something wrong with the Wendice union - the opening clench is theatrical, cold, unreal.  The family home is not comforting, but made strange objects don't blend in, but are threateningly present (lamps, drinks bottles etc.), always getting in the way of human communication (the telephone is an apt metaphor for the crisis in the film).  In a traditional detective story, it is through the displacement of ordinary items, taken for granted, that marks a rupture - the everyday becomes frightening.Wendice is unable to satisfy his wife - he is only interested in her money. when he talks to Swan about his marital difficulties, he walks with a cane, ostensibly a fake prop, but a clear hint of the impotence rejected when he drops it and talks of the murder that will reassert his patriarchal role. He is like a servant in his own home, dependent on his wife, serving her and her lover drinks.  He is probably gay - the handbag which has been transferred in association from his wife to him, is made the butt of a homophobic jibe by Inspector Hubbard.Most importantly, the conjugal home resembles a stage set.  This is the governing motif of the film.  Hitchcock subverts the hokey sentiments and values of Knott's play, by drawing attention to its staginess.  Props are foregrounded; Wendice is clearly a stage director\/author who is putting on a play (planning the murder of his wife).  He talks to Swan like he's a director instructing an actor, giving him his lines, showing him round the stage, telling him what to do, where to move; crucially, giving him his cue, timing, the 'call'.However, although Wendice seems in control, the gaze of the film does not belong to him - his authority is already undermined long before his plot unravels.  Frequently filmed in distanceng wide angle, this scene with Swan is shot from above, spied on from a seemingly unmotivated, godlike position, which only emhasises the unreality (theatricality) of the sequence.  There is another author beyond Wendice, who is really running the play.  Is it God?  Fate?  Hubris?  This position of authority is jostled for by the four male characters, in a frequently homoerotic manner.The only time this kind of shot becomes motivated, it belongs to the Inspector, suggesting that the law is the godlike arbiter, from whom nothing can be hidden.  And this is true, but not reassuring the Inspector is cold and detached; but, more unforgiveably, like the other male characters, two of whom tried to murder her, he sadistically inflicts pain on Mrs. Wendice, pushing her out of the story, in effect succeeding where Wendice and Swan failed; she is absent for most of the film's second half.  The law is shown to be both frightening and whimsical, rather like an Old Testament God. This is not comforting.This link between the author and authority, both trying to shape meaning, and 'create' truth, while in reality concealing it (Hubbard's assertion of patriarchal truth denies Mrs. Wendice's emotional reality) is linked to a story which is invoked in the film's opening MacGuffin, the stolen letter. Poe, a favourite of Hitchcock's, wrote 'The Purloined Letter' about a missive stolen by a respectable government minister, form a Queen possibly enjoying an adulterous relationship.  What's written in this letter, and who controls it, becomes a site of power between the two male characters, who squeeze out the female character, who owns it, altogether.  Knowledge, authority, power, and the artist are linked, all are abused, all are stolen from women.  Mrs. Wendice's absence in the middle of the film is the anguish seething behind the film's (or play's) smooth mechanics.  Anyone who thinks Hitchcock is just a technician is an idiot.  he had a profound grasp on the workings of society, and how people are sacrificed for it.He also shows the seductive appeal of power - Wendice is suave, hilarious, imperious, mandarin, the motor of the film, a joy to watch, and yet an automaton.  Hubbard's victory over him relies on Wendice's working like clockwork.  The author was really only an actor, parroting perfectly his fed lines.  It's significant that it should be a real author who exposes him.
