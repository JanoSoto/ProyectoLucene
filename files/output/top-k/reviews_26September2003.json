When they play back Melissa's video, with him moving in choppy slow motion, I just freak out. There is something so infinitely creepy about that guy, and whoever he is, he worked wonders for the movie.

Most will probably recognize Erwin Rommel and some may recognize Karl Gerd Von Runstedt, but it is doubtful most will know who Werner Pluskat or Josef Pips Priller or Gunther Blumentritt were (though James Bond fans will recognize Curt Jurgens, here playing Blumentritt).  Given this general lack of audience familiarity, the German scenes move along like a documentary.It is in the American and some of the British scenes that the Hollywood star power of the film comes into play.  Darryl F. Zanuck assembled the most ambitious cast in memory and all the major stars get quality screen time, from John Wayne and Robert Mitchum on down.  Roddy McDowell is best known for the mild British accent he imbued to so many of his roles, so much so that it takes a few viewings to recognize him as an American grunt. Richard Burton has only two scenes in the film, but he makes the most of them and has the strongest dialogue, notably in his conversation with an 82nd Airborne paratrooper - He's dead, I'm crippled, you're lost, I supposed that's what war is is one of the best lines in any film ever.Sean Connery would soon become famous as James Bond, and here he eats up the scenery with Norman Rossington as they land on the beaches, Connery chewing out the fact that an officer rallies the troops to remember Dunkirk even though he was not in the service at the time, and Rossington commenting on some of the absurdities involved in this battle - I tell you, there are some very peculiar blokes on this beach.The one scene I had a problem with is the assault on Pointe Du Hoc - the film notes that German guns that have been firing on the other beaches have been moved, and makes it out like the Army Rangers assaulted the hill for nothing; in actuality the Rangers tracked down the guns initially deployed at Pointe Du Hoc and destroyed them as they tried to besiege Allied Forces further inland.My favorite scenes are the travails of the 82nd Airborne batallion led by John Wayne's Colonel Benjamin Vandervoort, and the squabbles between Luftwaffe commandant Wolfgang Hager and hotheaded ace Colonel Josef Pips Priller.  Hager and Priller haggle it out on the telephone constantly, leading Hager's XO to ask why Priller was never court-martialled.

But it received such high ratings from other viewers that I feel it's my duty to offer a contrary opinion.The story evolves around a young girl, Bess, who lives in a small Scottish village along the coast.  The story unfolds as she's getting married to Jan, a worker on one of the drilling platforms in the North Sea.   Emily Watson (Angela's Ashes) plays Bess, and Stellan Skarsgård (Capt. Tupolev in Hunt for Red October) plays Jan.  When we first encounter Bess, the impression is that she's a simple country girl.  It's obvious Jan is the first man in her life other than her father.  But during a conversation with Jan, her sister reveals that there's something wrong in the head with Bess.  We see Bess acting like a five year old when Jan has to return to work, and there are scenes of her praying, with her speaking God's lines in one voice and hers in another.Bess is so desperate to have Jan stay at home that she prays for him to return.  Right after that, there's a terrible accident on the drilling rig and Jan is basically rendered a vegetable due to injuries to his head and spinal chord.  That's where I turned the VCR off.I knew from the plot outline on the Imdb page that the film was about Bess having sex with other men in order for her husband to live vicariously through the act, but frankly, I didn't really care at that point.  A story has to have sympathetic characters in order for the viewer to remain interested, and there were none in this film.The relationship between Jan and Bess was never developed.

She's so simpleminded, Jan could be a puppy dog for all it matters.  Up to that point, you never really see much character to Jan either - he's basically just a regular guy working on an oil rig.So, I just didn't see much point in continuing.

It was one of the best comedies of that year and won over more people on its release on video.  I didn't care to see it at first, but watched it when it came on cable and it won me over too.  The story has a somewhat grumpy weatherman sent to a city to do a story on the Groundhog there and the festival surrounding it.  I know the name of the city, but I am not even going to try to spell it.  He hates the idea and wants to get out of there as fast as he can.  Unfortunately, a blizzard hits and he has to stay longer (a blizzard he predicted would miss the area).  So he stays the night and the next morning starts out eerily the same as the previous.  At first he thinks it is just a coincidence, but realizes soon enough that the day is repeating over again.  It continually repeats throughout the movie and you get to see Murray begin to loath the town and then fall in love with it.  No real explanation is given for why the day repeats, but none is really needed and it is amusing to watch Murray go through the city knowing exactly when and where things will happen and getting to know all the people as well.  The movie takes kind of a somber twist near the end when some scenes involving a homeless man come up, but it doesn't stay somber instead going for a more positive, funny conclusion.  I love the scene with the kid in the tree.  How long he stays in the day is anyone's guess, but I figure he had to be there a good 15 years worth of days...my friend informs me it takes a while to master a piano that well.  This is a very funny and entertaining movie that is heart warming as well.  I also have to give it a chuckle cause of all the time he spent trying to pursue the one lady played by McDowell...It does take forever to win over the best gals out there doesn't it?  Chris Elliot is also in this one, but don't let that scare you off, he is actually rather good and doesn't detract from the movie at all.  All in all a very good comedy, bravo Harold Ramis.

I know the name of the city, but I am not even going to try to spell it.  He hates the idea and wants to get out of there as fast as he can.  Unfortunately, a blizzard hits and he has to stay longer (a blizzard he predicted would miss the area).  So he stays the night and the next morning starts out eerily the same as the previous.  At first he thinks it is just a coincidence, but realizes soon enough that the day is repeating over again.  It continually repeats throughout the movie and you get to see Murray begin to loath the town and then fall in love with it.  No real explanation is given for why the day repeats, but none is really needed and it is amusing to watch Murray go through the city knowing exactly when and where things will happen and getting to know all the people as well.  The movie takes kind of a somber twist near the end when some scenes involving a homeless man come up, but it doesn't stay somber instead going for a more positive, funny conclusion.  I love the scene with the kid in the tree.  How long he stays in the day is anyone's guess, but I figure he had to be there a good 15 years worth of days...my friend informs me it takes a while to master a piano that well.  This is a very funny and entertaining movie that is heart warming as well.  I also have to give it a chuckle cause of all the time he spent trying to pursue the one lady played by McDowell...It does take forever to win over the best gals out there doesn't it?  Chris Elliot is also in this one, but don't let that scare you off, he is actually rather good and doesn't detract from the movie at all.  All in all a very good comedy, bravo Harold Ramis.

John Candy is almost serious in this role as he ferrets out the bad guys, defends the honor of Meg Ryan's character (Maggie Cavanaugh) and helps to reverse her father's wayward ethics. Oddly enough, Eugene Levy is the funny guy to Candy's straight man act. It is an odd formula, but it was quite effective.

I'm God's lonely man Travis constantly writes in his diary. Trying to fit into a vast an impersonal city like New York is too much for Travis.

The first with Besty, Sybill Shepherd, a campaign worker for presidential candidate Charles Palintine, Lenoard Harris, and the second with Iris, Jody Foster, a 12 year old prostitute who turns tricks for and is looked after by her pimp Sport, Harvey Keitel. Travis spots Besty at the Palintine campaign offices in midtown Manhattan while he's driving his cab and falls in love with her. Travis going so far as to volunteer to work for the Palintine campaign so he can be with her. After a while Travis gets friendly and close enough with Besty to take her out to the movies on a date with him. It turns out that Travis' limited knowledge of the entertainment world, the only movies that Travis watches and knows about are porno flicks, leaves him hurt and humiliated when Besty, shocked that Travis would take her to an X-rated theater, walks out on him.Some time later Travis back on his job driving a cab one night in the East Village encounters Iris trying to run away from her pimp Sport when she jumps into his cab. Sport gets into the cab with Iris and after sweet talking Iris to come back with him gives Travis a twenty dollar bill for all the trouble that Iris caused and tells Travis to forget all about it.

His frustration together with his ignorance and alienation of the real world has turned Travis, who was friendly and likable if just a bit odd at the beginning of the movie, into a Frankenstein monster.

The movie also has one of the most haunting and memorable musical score that I've ever herd in any movie and it more then deserves all the accolades that it received over all these years. The only bad thing that I can say about Taxi driver is that director Martin Scorsese made the movie too soon in his career. It's been 27 years since Scorsese made the movie Taxi Driver and since then, with all the films that he directed, he's never come close to making any movie as good as it and for all we know he never will. Like Orson Wells in 1941 when he made Citizen Kane that over forty years until his death in 1985 Wells could never do anything on film to top that movie and the only place that Wells could go after he made Citizen Kane was down.

It has wonderful cinematography, an interesting story line, and a competent cast which evokes the period in question (WWI England). I probably wouldn't have watched it having seen the title, but while surfing the satellite channels, I came upon a scene with Peter O'Toole and Harvey Keitel, and I was transfixed.It's true that the story was inspired by a true story. I deliberately say inspired rather than based since the filmmakers did not base much of anything on reality. It's true that two girls (16 and 10, not the younger ages depicted in the movie) revealed photographs they had taken of fairies in the woods, and it's also true that Arthur Conan Doyle ate it up like Orson Welles at a smorgasbord. That's where the true part of the movie begins and ends. Really, the filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for adding A True Story to the title. They graphically and unequivocally showcase the fairies\/gnomes\/little people flying, scrambling, and cavorting in the woods -- if this is true, why not come out with their own set of Cottingley photos? The movie is very entertaining, it's a well-done fantasy and has a magical air to it, but please! Please don't call it a true story! It's an insult to the movie audience.Leaving out that the girls themselves, in later years, admitted the photos were faked, and leaving out that the poses of the fairies are identical to those in an illustration in a book of poems and stories that the girls no doubt possessed, one can tell instantly that the photos are fakes, and in my mind, not even clever ones. Conan Doyle was so gullible that he is on record disbelieving American psychics the Fox sisters when they themselves admitted their antics were all a hoax! He maintained that the spirits were acting through the sisters, even if they didn't believe so and were deliberately faking their seances! So let's not attach too much importance to Doyle believing in these fairy pictures. And Houdini is thrown in there for no good reason, simply because the writers discovered that he and Doyle were friends.Still, as I say, it's an engaging movie, well acted and filmed. I would have much preferred the director had left out the fairy scenes. Without those, they could have kept the true story aspect in all honesty, leaving the audience to decide whether the girls were charlatans or not. Leaving A True Story in the title is not only dishonest and misleading, it detracts from what otherwise is a very compelling and entertaining tale of two little girls and a wartime public, some of whom were desperate enough to believe in fairies!

It has wonderful cinematography, an interesting story line, and a competent cast which evokes the period in question (WWI England). I probably wouldn't have watched it having seen the title, but while surfing the satellite channels, I came upon a scene with Peter O'Toole and Harvey Keitel, and I was transfixed.It's true that the story was inspired by a true story. I deliberately say inspired rather than based since the filmmakers did not base much of anything on reality. It's true that two girls (16 and 10, not the younger ages depicted in the movie) revealed photographs they had taken of fairies in the woods, and it's also true that Arthur Conan Doyle ate it up like Orson Welles at a smorgasbord. That's where the true part of the movie begins and ends. Really, the filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for adding A True Story to the title. They graphically and unequivocally showcase the fairies\/gnomes\/little people flying, scrambling, and cavorting in the woods -- if this is true, why not come out with their own set of Cottingley photos? The movie is very entertaining, it's a well-done fantasy and has a magical air to it, but please! Please don't call it a true story! It's an insult to the movie audience.Leaving out that the girls themselves, in later years, admitted the photos were faked, and leaving out that the poses of the fairies are identical to those in an illustration in a book of poems and stories that the girls no doubt possessed, one can tell instantly that the photos are fakes, and in my mind, not even clever ones. Conan Doyle was so gullible that he is on record disbelieving American psychics the Fox sisters when they themselves admitted their antics were all a hoax! He maintained that the spirits were acting through the sisters, even if they didn't believe so and were deliberately faking their seances! So let's not attach too much importance to Doyle believing in these fairy pictures. And Houdini is thrown in there for no good reason, simply because the writers discovered that he and Doyle were friends.Still, as I say, it's an engaging movie, well acted and filmed. I would have much preferred the director had left out the fairy scenes. Without those, they could have kept the true story aspect in all honesty, leaving the audience to decide whether the girls were charlatans or not.

To show rocket physics in simple terms a Woody Woodpecker cartoon is used. Unlike some of the sci-fi films of the era (Ed Wood comes to mind), there is very little cheesy about this (unless you believe what they say about the moon).A small group of scientists have decided to get private US companies to finance the building of the rocketship to the moon.  I'm sure they had McCarthy breathing down their necks enough to use this line Whoever gets to the moon first will be able to hit anywhere militarily on Earth and rule the world.  In spite of the meglomaniacal military mentality of this, the rest of the film stays off of this track.It's interesting to compare this with the actual Apollo missions. First they show the weightlessness pretty accurately with decent weightless FXs, and when they walk on the spacecraft and someone drifts away they utilize something the first Galileo spacewalkers didn't even think of; using an oxygen tank as a jet to maneuver (after the first spacewalkers found it too difficult without them the spacewalk jets were later used).  They ate bananas and coffee (as opposed to tang and baby food), and they never showed how they used the bathroom (in Apollo it was with great difficulty).And the idea to land the rocket whole on the moon was the original concept of Apollo until the main designer found it was much easier to create a Lunar Module.  The FX of Earth from space was pretty accurate even if the colors weren't quite right, and most striking was how the moon looked in this film.  Check it against the Apollo footage and you'll know they were accurate.  I mean in 1950 they did have telescopes powerful enough to see the lunar surface up close and they utilized this.  And most impressive is the science, being accurate with the airlocks, 1\/6th gravity, and even the crisis where they must lower the payload.And compare the words of what the 2 astronauts who first step onto the lunar surface tell the world via radio First impression is one of utter barrenness and desolation...most intensely brilliant stars anyone ever dreamed of.  Buzz Aldrin said Magnificent desolation.  And I claim possession for the United States for the benefit of all mankind.  Neil Armstrong planted the American flag and said the mankind bit.Remember this was all theoretical and a decade before anyone had even entered space.  The stars I guess is what turns people off here, as they are too bright and looked more like lightbulbs.  I guess the technology wasn't good enough back then to use actual star footage, but even on the Star Trek TOS intro they use fake stars.And considering all the B films about space travel since (the one with James Caan in '68, The Stowaway in '74, Capricorn One '79, Mission to Mars '99), this stands out for it's being dead on in many ways, even using 4 astronauts (opposed to 3).  I'm wondering if the Apollo planners took some cues from this film.No, it's no 2001 Space Odyssey, but it's great for 1950.  And one other point  they even predict the Space Shuttle, as the rocket is designed to glide to a landing.  I'm wondering when mankind will once again venture to the Moon, establish a moonbase, then onto Mars and beyond.  We have the technology now, so let's do it!

With great acting from Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald etc, great direction by john himself, and great scene settings, it is a work of art. It is one of few movies that the film is able to stay in the one setting, and yet still be extremely entertaining. The character that steals the show, has to be John Bender (Judd Nelson). With his witty comments, and his personal family problems, we are able to feel so many emotions; anger, pity, humour.  It was a shame that this was the only blockbuster that he appeared in (except of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back).Overall, i have to give this movie a 9 out of 10, for its sheer excellence.
