And perhaps one of the movies to really define an era of sci-fi. Almost every future society movie after it, tried to copy some of the same environment and the same type of look and feel. None succeeded. Blade Runner is basically a story of a man in doubt, in doubt of himself and his way of life. He used to be a hit-man, a so-called Blade Runner, who hunts down stray androids called Replicants and retire them. But after meeting a replicant called Kate, which has had memories implanted, causing her to develop human-like emotions, he starts to realize that what we see as the definition of life isn't really the only correct one. He is starting to get a nagging feeling that replicants aren't just any other machine. This movie is about taking a good look at how we define humanity, and how we define life itself. Is a life less worth, because it's not human and only a machine? The movie lacks a lot of story that Philip K. Dick's book has, but i still think they've managed to keep the most important parts. The excistential question is there, just as strong as in the novel, and the less important parts of the story isn't really a great loss, movie wise. The movie is also backed by one of the best movie soundtracks of all times, courtesy of Vangelis. The music really helps transmit the feel of this darkish future society. This is the movie that really made the concept of cyberpunk into what it is today.Replicants are like any other machine, they're either a benefit or a hazard.

I could see right away that this film was heavily influenced by the work of French graphic artist Moebius. Sure enough, when I saw the credits, there was Moebius' name. The film captures the European sci-fi style that permeated Metal Hurlant and featured the work of Moebius and other top European artists. I think this is one of the facets that many film critics couldn't understand. They only seem to be able to handle Kubrick or Lucas. I was amazed that many called the film incomprehensible. It makes more sense than the last third of 2001 A Space Odyssey!The film has nice balance of action, drama and comedy. It doesn't take itself too seriously, nor does it degenerate into camp; and, it is always exciting. Bruce Willis puts in a nice turn as the hero and Mila Jovavich shines as Leeloo. Gary Oldman gets to chew some scenery and Ian Holm is always good. Heck, even Tiny Lister is passable, which is saying a lot for him. The music is outstanding, as is always the case with Eric Serra. The opera piece was hypnotic. I didn't even mind Chris Tucker.I have heard some people claim that the story is borrowed from the Harry Canyon sequence from Heavy Metal. Actually, Harry Canyon was borrowed (or stolen) from Moebius and Dan O'Bannon's The Long Tomorrow, a Dashiell Hammet rif in a sci-fi setting. The producers were unable to secure the rights for the story and created their own, similar sory (much like Tarna was inspired by Arzach). The Fifth Element owes more to the Valerian graphic novels by Jean-Claude Mezieres and Pierre Christin. These stories date back to the late 60's, and Mezieres was a conceptual designer, along with Moebius, for The Fifth Element. Moebius' Incal was also a major influence. In fact, the original story for this movie was changed to make the hero a taxi driver (instead of a factory worker) after seeing a flying taxi in Mezieres' latest Valerian album.Although there is no set up for a sequel, I would love to see these characters again, or see Besson work in sci-fi again.

This is a really tough movie to review due to the fact that it is a love hate movie. You either love it for it's different plot, a great cast, or the ending that turns your mind upside down. Or you may hate it for its extremely confusing story, characters that only have one scene and never reappear, and an ending that blew your mind and when you could'nt understand it you took that as dislike for the movie. Since theres two sides of the fence I'm here to tell you what side I am on.The Movie- Great movies are ones that provide hours of discussions. You want a movie where you are still thinking of it days after the intail viewing. I first saw this movie on a Monday. After viewing it I was shocked at how the movie jerked around your mind so much. I could'nt take my mind off that movie for a whole week. Then one night I stopped at Hollywood video to pick up a movie and I ended up buying 2. Eight Legged Freaks and The Shipping News. The Shipping news sucked so I took it back and got Mulholland DR. That movie stuck with me so I had to get it. It's lucky I found it to it was the only copy behind a ton of Panic Room DVDs. You cant really tell someone what Mulholland DR. is about. You have to expeirence it for yourself. I'll try to give a brief summery. On the surface this seems like some sort of a mystery. A woman is in a car crash that takes place on the street Mulholland DR. She comes out of it and has lost her memory. She takes the name Rita and meets up with Betty, a women who came down to her aunts place to become an actress. The two work together to find out Ritas ture identity. Along with this main plot there are little subplots that seem to have nothing to do with the story. Things like the man at Winkies, the director, and the cowboy. You keep track of the plot and think you have a good understanding of everything when the plot takes a huge turn and wipes away everything you thought you knew. Mulholland DR. was origanlly going to be a ABC show but it got stopped in production. They had already filmed a 2 hour pilot but it wasn't going to be aired. The project was in the can for awhile untill a company called up David Lynch and gave him some money to film some new footage to wrap up the story so they could realese it in theaters. That may explain why the ending was so abrupt. It's a very good movie that will keep you hooked the whole way through.

Not because of his teen movies, but because he made my favorite comedy ever `Planes, Trains and Automobiles' with Steve Martin and John Candy. But that has little to do with Uncle Buck; if you want to read my review on `Planes&#133;' it is on this site. Anyway&#133;John Hughes' second to last film he directed was a little, low budget comedy named `Uncle Buck,' about a guy named Buck (John Candy) and his ordeals of the week.Basically, to make a long story short, Buck's brother and sister-in-law are called out of town because of a family emergency. But, unfortunately, they cannot leave their three children (a teenager and two smaller kids) at home, alone. After calling many neighbors to no avail, Buck's brother realizes that the only option left is a big, large slob named Buck.John Candy brings his warm screen presence straight outta' downtown Chicago to watch the kids for `A week at the most.' Little does he know what will ensue. Buck has no idea whatsoever how to care for kids. One of the most endearing things about this comedy is his chemistry and connection with the smaller children.Another funny thing is how Buck handles the teenage girl. She is used to being free, basically; but Buck, like most parents and adults, has been through things before, and knows everything going on in her life and what it will lead to. He sees right through her boyfriend `Bug' to his real intentions.`Uncle Buck' has some very, very funny moments. Some of the gags fall short a bit, but it is still a winner. Some of the best parts are stretched-out, making it even funnier. The thing about `UB' is that unlike many comedies, there are long segments that are funny, instead of individual jokes throughout like `Airplane' and Mel Brooks films. `Uncle Buck' is NOT slapstick. It is a comedy, plain and simple. But this does not mean it doesn't have any good lines. There are some funny one-liners that have John Candy saying things like `Ever heard of a ritual killing,' etc&#133; (anyone who's seen the movie knows what I mean).John Candy uses his natural comedic charm in this film; he is loveable and huggable.Macaulay Culkin has his best role in this film. He was not yet an annoying brat, and could actually handle his lines, for once, without sounding like he is reading off a piece of cardboard (see `Home Alone' and\/or `The Good Son').John Hughes directs the film in his typical fashion. I'm not sure what that fashion is, but whatever it is, it's good.Basically, when it all comes down to it, `Uncle Buck' delivers everything you want in a comedy. It's great for a Friday or Saturday night. It may not be as great as `Planes&#133;' but it sure as heck is funny.Every time I see the freeze-frame ending it makes me want to cry (well, I feel sad, at least), because like `Planes&#133;' the freeze-frame captures John Candy at his best, with his heart shining through. I think that is why he is one of the greatest comedians ever.

The only thing I can come up with is to blame the marketing folks who put together the trailers, which made the movie out to be serious science fiction. It isn't. It's a comedy. Only a small handfull of serious movie fans would not be majorly disappointed over having been duped. I consider myself to be a serious movie fan and I love Battlefield Earth. The performances by John Travolta and Forest Whitaker were so funny I could hardly stop laughing and the comic book camera angles completely blew me away. Yes, the story is silly but that just makes the movie even sillier...perfect for a comedy, and just what I would have hoped for.

I watch around 70 movies every single month....movies being my only passion....and I enjoy better than 95% of everything I watch. Obviously, I do quite a bit of research before I select a film and I also have a few simple tricks to keep my level of disappointment to a minimum. One is really simple. I've noticed I like almost everything Roger Ebert likes so I can easily add his thumbsup picks to my list. If Roger pans something, I look a little deeper to see if any viewers liked the movie and why they liked it. Yep, Roger sometimes has a bad day and ends up panning a movie that is actually quite good. Reading movie reviews from average viewers helps alot, also. Battlefield Earth is a good example. If you scan the reviews, you'll notice a few people who loved the movie and alot of people who hated it. Try to figure out why those few people loved it, what they saw that others may have missed, and you might discover a true gem. For the record, I also liked Heavens Gate, Water World, and Billy Murray's Razors Edge.....all of which were heavily panned. Bottom line.....if you're looking for a seriously fun movie in a comic book format with John Travolta doing his funniest stuff ever, try Battlefield Earth.

Effective, I suppose, on a morbid level, since it avoids being nothing but a typical revelation of a brutally murdered body, but tiring in the way that it is executed (the scene, not the body, and no pun intended, of course). For some reason this reminds me of the scene in Joe Dirt where David Spade finds himself with a missile shaped septic tank strapped to his back, which ends up spewing its gooey contents onto his astonished head, and instead of attempting to prevent the sludge from bathing him from head to foot, he stands motionless, going `Wah! Wah! Wah!' and subjecting himself to the onslaught of the pasty substance. This is something that is easily avoided in real life (even if you DO somehow manage to wind up with a septic tank on your back), and the fact that Dirt makes not even the slightest attempt to avoid it reveals the scene as a weak effort to get a cheap laugh. Any blood-dripping scene in a horror film, similarly, is an equally weak effort to get a scare. In this case, a gross out scare, a brand which is inherently weak in itself.The blood-dripping scene in Bad Dreams strikes me, for the main reason, because the rest of the movie is not much of a horror film except for the occasional appearance of the cult leader from the beginning of the film turning up as a horribly burned corpse, haunting poor Cynthia, the lone survivor (as usual) of the tragic event at the beginning of the film. The movie starts off with one of those goofball cult meetings, where everyone decides to commit mass suicide in order to become one with each other, or some other such nonsense. It starts off by making a comment about the destructive power of stupid people in large groups, but then turns into this weird horror\/thriller for the rest of the movie. There are a few effective scenes in the film, such as, ironically, the scene where Ralph, one of Cynthia's new roommates at the mental institution, tells her that whenever it gets to be too much for him, he just makes a little hole and it all goes away. He lifts up his shirt and reveals a map of scars traveling up his belly and chest, which is a huge turn from the horny teenage goofball that he had been portraying up to that point in the film (probably something that helped in getting him the role of Dave in the Ski School films of the early and mid 1990s, the films that he is probably best known for). But for the most part this is a pretty weak film.Bad Dreams fails as a horror film because not a single new idea can be found in the movie, which renders its horror content completely predictable and almost entirely without effect, and it fails as a thriller (although not as much as it fails as a horror film), because it crosses the thin line between horror and thriller, inserting too much gore and supernatural antagonism where it doesn't belong, and thereby coming off as campy at best. It is, however, more entertaining than other bad movies I've found in the horror section lately, such as Neon Maniacs, which has cemented itself as one of the worst horror films I've ever seen, and not even bad in that good way, like They Live or Texas Chainsaw or some of the Friday the 13th or Nightmare of Elm Street sequels. The tagline for Bad Dreams (the one on the top of the cover box, not the goofy `It's A Scream!' at the bottom) is a little interesting, in the way that it creates interest in the movie since you just have a natural urge to find out why someone would wish they were dead upon waking up (although this is also a pretty weak way create interest in a movie, especially a horror movie), but it also has nothing to do with the movie itself. Anytime a movie has a tagline that turns out to be a figure of speech, it tends to have the effect of leaving a bad aftertaste. The entirety of the suspense in the film, in fact, is derived from the fact that Cynthia does NOT wish she were dead upon awakening. The cult leader coming after her is the one that wishes she were dead, so if she really wished she was dead so badly all she had to do was give in and let him take her. This is, of course, not the case, and so we have a movie. But the strange thing about it is that, despite having almost no strengths at all, it makes me wonder if maybe horror films are SUPPOSED to be bad, at least to be memorable. This one wasn't all that terrible, but makes little to no impression. The acting is weak from everyone involved (even from the beautiful Jennifer Rubin, who strikes me as an actor who should have had a more visible career than she has had so far), and the directing is little more than pointing and shooting, but the movie is almost immediately forgettable. Maybe in swaying on the line between horror and thriller, Bad Dreams made the unfortunate mistake of landing right in that limbo zone between a truly great horror film and a truly awful one &#150; the zone of oblivion.
