These however are all positives for director Andrei Tarkovsky's goals with what could be considered a masterpiece, to use the term once again. It's a dense film, but within this density layers of interest that many of today's science-fiction films wouldn't even think to consider much less attempt are present and alive. Its visual prowess is another big piece of what makes Stalker such a triumph. Never do we get cuts too quick or shots that go by in the blink of an eye, far from it. Tarkovsky is putting the audience through long shots, as in surpassing five minutes, give or take a minute, and the craft is hypnotic; he uses his skills very simply in pans and tilts and subtle zoom-ins and outs, and there's even a few shots, like the pan up in close-up over the un-real\/real objects in the river with metaphorical significance leading to the hand, that are some of the most haunting in all of cinema.It's not an easy trip through what is actually a very simple premise a stalker, Aleksandr Kajdanovsky, is going to take a writer and a philosopher through the dangerous terrain to the zone, where anything innermost in said person can be realized. Aside from the surpassing of the guarded gates into the entrance, where there are gun-shots and the like, Tarkovsky isn't interested in action things happening, but themes expressed squarely through narrow, representative characters and mood. This mood is one that is wrong if looking at the back of the video box, which compares the ambiance and realm of science fiction to that of Blade Runner. In the sense of it breaking clichés, sure, it's similar, but that's really all on a shallow level. Tarkovsky's design for the picture is tantamount to being hyper stylized, but never too noticeable in the sense of it looking 'fake'. There may be a moment or two where the zone does look like a ZONE from a not-quite nuclear fall-out, like the one room with sandy dunes on the floor. But it's also right out of Russia, with industry and decay of the period all in direct view. The hopelessness is conveyed not just through the humorlessness of the characters, but in the zone itself, which looks like it's been not constructed completely by the crew.I was originally spurned on to see it not only because of seeing Tarkovsky's Solaris and Andrei Rublev- the former also an experimental feat of intelligent, emotionally complex sci-fi- but because of a couple of clips featured in the documentary The Pervert's Guide to Cinema. In it, Zizek uses Stalker to describe how there can be a world, or a form of a world, where the ideal of Godlessness is given full form into a world without belief, and where decay and industrialization are all there can be seen. But then there is also the 'Zone', which is also in line with the idea of there being order, of hope, yet also the total despair in getting something otherworldly. Does the Zone need human beings as much as human beings need the zone? Questions like these, as well as what it means to be a creator of art, as the writer goes to lengths describing, in a post-apocalyptic environment, or what it is to actually enter into an alien construct, or what may be an alien construct, as what may be illusion is stronger than that becoming a reality, or what the stalker has in responsibility to himself, others, and humanity at large, come up repeatedly. So, at the least, Stalker can't be considered as a work without a thought process to it. Quite the contrary, there's even a poetry to all of the thoughts and visuals that keep coming up, be they through the conversations on the way to the Zone, or in that climax on the precipice of the Room where the potential of destruction comes at a heavy price following all that's happened. Tarkovsky even tops himself from Solaris by making human need and suffering and, as a human construct, the fantastical imaginings of what is out there as here, paramount and affecting. Fear, greed and ego, and a desire for some minor level of any sense of peace through whatever medium is available, is what Tarkovsky suggests and prods, but never outright answers; it comes as a great shock and relief at the end, when the boy Monkey shows an unusual 'moment' at the table. This being said, Stalker won't be for everyone, surely not the Star Wars geeks looking for pomp and circumstance against motifs out of the old West. It might even feel too long and plodding by those who put 2001 at the top of their favorite movie lists. But it also has an astonishing appeal to those who may gravitate to it, where ideas and scenery, reflections on society and a specific take on a dark alternate future, get at a very high level of sophistication and artistry.

Somehow Egoyan seems to think that all he has to do is show her turning on her father late in the film and we'll all understand how wretched she really felt. Instead, she simply comes across as a manipulator, not as a young woman whose life has been virtually ruined.Small things irritated me. Why would bush hippies in the 1990's be wearing clothes from the 70's? Same thing with the interiors of homes where we understand that people are poor. And why would the daughter of Bruce Greenwood's single parent, working-class character have Shirley Temple curls? Did he spend half and hour every morning doing her hair perfectly while forgetting to shave, clean his clothes or put in his false tooth? The correct answer is, of course, that seeing an unbearably cute child die in a bus accident is worse than seeing an ordinary one lose her life. It's so Toronto to sneer at Hollywood, then steal its worst traits.There's an excruciatingly bad performance by one of the lesser roles in the film, which makes you wonder how Ian Holm coped. He must have mustered every possible resource as an actor to compensate for some of the cringe-worthy material and performances around him.

It is of course remembered for its amazing and shocking ending. I can tell you though, there is much more to this film than just the ending.People who say The Sixth Sense is rubbish because the ending is obvious and they figured it out are just being stupid and they don't know what they are talking about. I have watched films before knowing the ending, and have still enjoyed them as much as anyone. The ending is there for you to see throughout the film, but it is still hard to figure out - a bit like the twist in Fight Club. Even without the great ending though, this film would still be excellent. Bruce Willis has proved once again that he has many more strings to his bow than just action hero John McClane that made him famous, as he puts in a wonderful performance as a doctor haunted by his past. The script and direction by M. Night Shyamalan is also very good. Despite these two great performances though, the stand out has to be Haley Joel Osment as the disturbed young boy. He is really freaky, and he really captures how scared his character would probably be in real life.The huge twist ending does divert attention from the rest of the film, but the rest of the film should not be forgotten. If you haven't watched this yet, you will not just be sat there waiting for the ending, the whole storyline is a compelling and disturbing drama. It is a film to watch more than once, as the ending does fit in perfectly with the storyline before it. The ending of Unbreakable is about as shocking, but I don't think Shyamalan will ever make another film as good as this.

It is of course remembered for its amazing and shocking ending. I can tell you though, there is much more to this film than just the ending.People who say The Sixth Sense is rubbish because the ending is obvious and they figured it out are just being stupid and they don't know what they are talking about. I have watched films before knowing the ending, and have still enjoyed them as much as anyone. The ending is there for you to see throughout the film, but it is still hard to figure out - a bit like the twist in Fight Club. Even without the great ending though, this film would still be excellent. Bruce Willis has proved once again that he has many more strings to his bow than just action hero John McClane that made him famous, as he puts in a wonderful performance as a doctor haunted by his past. The script and direction by M. Night Shyamalan is also very good. Despite these two great performances though, the stand out has to be Haley Joel Osment as the disturbed young boy. He is really freaky, and he really captures how scared his character would probably be in real life.The huge twist ending does divert attention from the rest of the film, but the rest of the film should not be forgotten. If you haven't watched this yet, you will not just be sat there waiting for the ending, the whole storyline is a compelling and disturbing drama. It is a film to watch more than once, as the ending does fit in perfectly with the storyline before it. The ending of Unbreakable is about as shocking, but I don't think Shyamalan will ever make another film as good as this.

It is the ultimate tribute to every movie of the genre. Sergio Leone's masterpiece captures all the themes that were recurrent in westerns during that time love, revenge, money, the railroad, the frontier and converges them into an epic, poetic representation of the ideal West, the one we've all heard and read about. The opening scene is a slow gut-crushing build up of tension as three gunman sit and wait at a run-down train station in the desert. We are not given an explanation why, all we do know is that when that train comes something's going to happen. During these minutes of anticipation barely a word is spoken, it is as if time has stopped. Yet Leone like an artist, paints this moment with stunning detail. Every move, every expression a character makes is so carefully choreographed that it makes these three men shine, it makes them memorable even if their participation in the movie extends to this scene only. The camera shots range from extreme close ups to breathtaking shots of the landscape creating an epic and yet personal feel. The traditional introduction with a musical theme is thrown away instead Morricone employs a different kind of music, one that relies entirely on environmental sounds (the drops of water, the fly, the windmill's creaking) to create a proper mood to these minutes of anticipation. The culmination of that music is the sound of the train coming. Signaling the end of the three gunmen's wait. The train stops at the station to refill, they gather and await, anticipating that their target will get off it. No one does. The train refilled starts it's engine once again, preparing to leave the run-down station. The three men decide to do the same but as soon they turn their backs and head to the horses the environmental sounds are disrupted by something unnatural, something not made by machines or wind, but by man. It is the sound of the harmonica, playing a dark, bitter tune. The gunmen turn around trying to figure out where the sound is coming from, they watch the train wagons slowly move away revealing the man with the harmonica. He gazes them and continues playing for awhile. The end of the tune marks the final moments of the scene as the man with the harmonica exchanges a few lines of dialogue with the gunmen. Finding their answer unsatisfying a new type of silence begins, accompanied by a new musical piece by Morricone. Simple in it's composition and straight forward in it's increasingly menacing sound it helps build up the nerve-wrecking tension of these final moments of life. The high point of the entire scene, the moment of violence, lasts a little more than a second as Harmonica fires three shots, one for each gunmen. Killing them, but not before one is able to shoot back, he is hit near the shoulder and falls to the ground. Silence. Only the creaking sound of the windmill is heard. Harmonica regains conscience, he bandages his arm and leaves. End scene.The reason why I described this scene is because it serves as an overview for the entire movie. Not only because it demonstrates the directing technique Leone uses but also because in it's core it holds three of the plot elements that make Once Upon A Time In The West, the train, the water used for refilling the train and the harmonica. These devices become the central objects that motivate the main characters and as the movie progresses we see how they interweave with each other, we see how they are connected. Sergio Leone has e certain philosophy when it comes to making films. His idea of entertainment doesn't come from the violence he puts in films. While most directors glamorize the on screen death, turning it into the central part of the enjoyment. Leone creates entertainment from the build up of tension, the of anticipation leading towards the violence, not the killing itself. We saw him experimenting with that idea in The Dollars Trilogy with every next film becoming more and more closer to the ideal. Here. Here is where he perfected that. Leone takes his time to introduce us to the characters, he makes them interesting, he makes them seem alive. Giving us all the more reason to care when the final confrontation takes place.

Death (Bengt Ekerot) follows him and tells Antonius that his time is up. Not willing to go until he finds out the truth about the afterlife, Antonius challenges Death to a game of chess. And it's a winner take all game (life and death).The game takes a few days to play, and as Antonius travels with his trusty squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand) they encounter other wayward souls looking for life's meaning. Most notable among these is a band of traveling actors; a man named Jof (Nils Popppe), his wife Mia (Bibi Andersson), and their infant child (thinks Joseph, Mary, and Jesus and you'll be right on target). Jof is a juggler, but also a visionist. He can see strange things, and although this is made slight of during the early portions of the film, it is later a pivotal catalyst to the entire movie's machinations.Antonius and his band of vagabonds drift through Sweden as The Black Death sweeps across the nation. Death is very busy, thus giving Antonius more time to make it home to his wife (whom he hasn't seen in years).But once home, Death catches up with Antonius, and he has to come to terms with the afterlife, whether he wants to or not. When Death knocks at the home of Antonius Block, everyone inside has to decide what awaits them on the other side. Antonius prays for enlightenment about God (if there is one) and hopes to receive a sign (which never really comes).In the end, his efforts at delaying Death help Jof, Mia and their infant child escape the unknown of the hereafter, thus giving a sense of meaning to Antonius' life.It is noteworthy to mention that this movie has a seriously stilted screenplay. The actors' lines often seem strange and even out of place, making the viewer shrug in a mind-boggling way.

Death (Bengt Ekerot) follows him and tells Antonius that his time is up. Not willing to go until he finds out the truth about the afterlife, Antonius challenges Death to a game of chess. And it's a winner take all game (life and death).The game takes a few days to play, and as Antonius travels with his trusty squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand) they encounter other wayward souls looking for life's meaning. Most notable among these is a band of traveling actors; a man named Jof (Nils Popppe), his wife Mia (Bibi Andersson), and their infant child (thinks Joseph, Mary, and Jesus and you'll be right on target). Jof is a juggler, but also a visionist. He can see strange things, and although this is made slight of during the early portions of the film, it is later a pivotal catalyst to the entire movie's machinations.Antonius and his band of vagabonds drift through Sweden as The Black Death sweeps across the nation. Death is very busy, thus giving Antonius more time to make it home to his wife (whom he hasn't seen in years).But once home, Death catches up with Antonius, and he has to come to terms with the afterlife, whether he wants to or not. When Death knocks at the home of Antonius Block, everyone inside has to decide what awaits them on the other side. Antonius prays for enlightenment about God (if there is one) and hopes to receive a sign (which never really comes).In the end, his efforts at delaying Death help Jof, Mia and their infant child escape the unknown of the hereafter, thus giving a sense of meaning to Antonius' life.It is noteworthy to mention that this movie has a seriously stilted screenplay.

These wafers are what the majority of mankind rely on as their only source of food since any regular food even an apple cost for more than what the average person can afford. Eddie G. plays the most sympathetic character as Sol, the wise old man, who comments that people were always rotten, but the world was beautiful once.Although it is considered a sci fi classic, the film has not held up well over time and looks extremely dated by todays standards. Casting Heston in this film was def a mistake since he looks older than the character he is suppose to play. With the exception of Eddie G, most of the acting is substandard and a lot of the scenes seem forced and unrealistic.

The entire film consists of a group of desperate real estate salesman sitting around at the office, in a car, in a phone booth, at a bar; simply sitting and talking, and not doing particularly much. An early morning burglary occurs during the film, but we don't get to see that. The characters just talk. They get angry, they utter countless obscenities to express their frustration, and they each get into a highly-vocal confrontation with each member of the all-male cast at least once. Herein lies the film's brilliance.If ever there was a film with the perfect ensemble cast, this one is it. Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey, Alec Baldwin&#133; Everybody involved plays their character to blissful perfection, and not an ounce of talent goes to waste. David Mamet's grittily realistic script is snappy enough to rival anything that Tarantino or the Coen Brothers have ever written, and the actors exploit this to its full potential. Watching these stunning performances is a simply mesmerising experience, and the running time flew by so unbelievably quickly that I came out wishing it had gone on for twice as long.'Glengarry Glen Ross' covers two days in the life of a real estate salesman (or, more accurately, one night and the following morning). The film dashes about between the characters; people come and go as they please. As such, it is difficult to determine a leading character, though Jack Lemmon's Shelley Levene undoubtedly forms the film's backbone. In past years, The Machine Levene was a powerful force within the company, the most successful salesman for eight months of the year, three years' running. However, now he's experiencing what he describes as a bad streak, and faces being fired if he doesn't accomplish anything profitable in the very near future. Being laid off would probably prove a relief for Levene, but his daughter is in need of an operation, and he needs the money to support her. Lemmon is absolutely perfect in the role, cutting effortlessly between despair and desperation, fear and elation. We are sympathetic towards his plight, but Levene ultimately embodies those qualities that we detest in a human being &#150; he will cheat, lie and steal, without even a moment's consideration for the wellbeing of his victims. All that matters to him is getting clients to sign on that dotted line. This effectively describes every character in the film.If watching characters simply talk to each other for 90 minutes can be this unbelievably captivating, then why do we even need anything to happen in our films?!
