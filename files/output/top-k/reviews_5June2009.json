Simply, about five years before The Incredibles, was made, Brad Bird was attached to direct one of the most underrated movies of all time, The Iron Giant. I gotta say, I only watched this twice and even though I know what happens the second time, it is still heartwarming and Brad Bird's best. Let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will appear as an event in the movie.Our main characters are The Iron Giant (Vin Diesel) and Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal). The relationships in this film are amazing and subtle. They aren't shoving it in your face they just play it naturally and the relationship between these two is no exception. They're both fun characters and The Iron Giant gets his funny moments too. The main villain is probably Kent Mansley(Christopher McDonald). He's just annoying and a jerk but that's what makes him such an awesome villain-ish. He's obsessed with destroying the Giant that he forces Hogarth to tell him where it is and if he doesn't cooperate, he's gonna take him away from his mother! ... YOU SICK TWISTED *******! The supporting characters are, Hogarth's mom, Annie Hughes (Jennifer Aniston) and Dean McCoppin(Harry Connick Jr.). Once again, the relationships here are very subtle and the cross relationships of Hogarth to his mom, Dean, Kent, and the giant are amazing (and all that that implies lol). The action in here is amazing, especially near the last part. Kent gets the AIRFORCE to strike at one giant. Once again, forgive me for this... YOU SICK TWISTED *******! Now the story is simple. A robot crashes on Earth and a kid befriends it. The kid tries to prevent anyone seeing him but A SICK TWISTED *******! ... sorry tries to find out about the robot and tries to get the army to destroy it. Well, this is on my top movies list and I'm proud to give The Iron Giant, 88% awesome!

Anyway, everyone remembers the RMS Titanic. It was big, fast, and unsinkable... until April 1912. It was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever. Well James Cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship. Well, onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film.So our two main characters are Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). They're not annoying too much but watch this and you'll find out why they could become annoying ( http\/\/tinyurl.com\/ojhoyn ). The main villain I guess is bad luck, fate, hand of God (no blasphemy intended), or just plain Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane). Combine all of the above and what do you get?! Oh yes! We get a love story on a sinking boat. The supporting characters are the following My personal favorite, Mr. Andrews (Victor Garber)(idk he was so nice), Lovejoy(David Warner), Murdoch(Ewan Stewart), Lightoller (Jonathan Phillips), Captain Smith(Bernard Hill), Molly Brown(Kathy Bates), and many more. We also got the present day treasure hunter, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton). They add something to the story, something good. The action in here is awesome, especially in the second half, the drama as also good. In the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears. The story is simple and it works. A treasure hunter seeks the Heart of the Ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond. She calls and tells her tale on the RMS Titanic. Two lovers separated by social class and ultimately, the fate of the ship. Everything about the story works and there are very few flaws.

That 1960 release was widely publicised and so there was a lot to live up to in 1963 when The Birds was released, and as usual for the British director, he knocked us over once more.Psycho was a shocking wake up to the realisation of human madness and Hitchcock again gains access to a concept of realization in this horror by depicting what many would assume as normal well mannered and beautiful creatures, and adds a horrifying viciousness to the birds to give a sharp and tantalizing story that will grip and shock you right till the claustrophobic and nerve jangling finale.The film begins, as usual for the legendary director, with a wonderful montage title sequence. We see a flock of birds acting unusually as the credits roll. It is a complete beautiful blur of wings and fighting with the screeches unmistakable and the juxtaposition of sound and motion gears viewers up for the horrific adventure to come.After another wonderfully cheeky cameo by Hitchcock we are introduced to central character Melanie who, after a flirtatious debate with a strange good looking man, uses her influences to track him down. As the stunning Tippi Hedren makes her way to Bodega Bay with a surprise install for Taylor's Mitch Brenner, Hitchcock delivers a wonderful car driving montage again. If not as springy as those in Vertigo but the feeling of anticipation is nailed down. If you haven't seen the Birds yet and have read reviews, you will feel the same wonderful excitement I felt to, and it is definitely worth it.Hitchcock after all is known as the master of suspense and one of the main reasons why this film works so gloriously is the fact the tension and surprise is built up in such a constructed free and significantly realistic way. What starts out as a minor attack on a boat turns into a town spread panic that generates tension and horror of the utmost brilliance, the suspense and anticipation is brilliantly priceless.Of all of Hitchcock's films, The Birds is surely one of the best filmed. To create the shots of the animals sitting on the climbing frames at the school, to have them all swooping down the chimney, it is simply breathtaking film-making and as a viewer, you feel rewarded and treated to this suspense and appreciation of horror and the unnatural.Once the birds attack there is never any let up in suspense as the characters try to find solutions and look for any way to survive and as in true Hitchcock fashion, he delivers a smart horror that generates realism with a swooping and smart depiction of the nature of the winged creatures that will shock and scare right till the end.

Walken plays a scientist who, along with fellow computer wizard Fletcher, has developed a virtual reality device, which allows the wearer to see, hear, smell, taste and feel the experiences of another person whose sensations have been recorded onto special tape that can be played back. The excitement over the breakthrough isn't allowed to last long before shifty owner and backer Robertson is letting the government take an interest in it for military purposes and also before certain individuals abuse the pleasurable aspects of it, causing detriment to themselves. Walken's estranged wife Wood is hired on to reduce the mammoth helmet to a more workable, sellable size. Walken uses the device to impart his feelings of love towards Wood into a tape that demonstrates his feelings and gives it to her as a reminder. They have barely begun to reconnect when the trouble surrounding the device starts to hit home and create havoc. Eventually, they have to take measures to prevent it from proceeding further, though there is danger to their own selves in taking that stance. Walken, never one to come off as completely normal or balanced in any film, is afforded the rare opportunity to play a somewhat traditional leading man. There's a cerebral quality to him that makes him well suited to this material. Interestingly, he is noticeably younger than both Wood and Fletcher (who he is also romantically involved with in the film.) Wood is often radiant in this movie (which she died before completing in a very controversial drowning accident) and establishes considerable chemistry with Walken. There are a few off-kilter costumes and overly fussy hairdos (she looks best, believe it or not, when her hair is all pulled back off her face in one scene), but she generally looks good and tries to invest her flimsy character with real emotion.

The excitement over the breakthrough isn't allowed to last long before shifty owner and backer Robertson is letting the government take an interest in it for military purposes and also before certain individuals abuse the pleasurable aspects of it, causing detriment to themselves. Walken's estranged wife Wood is hired on to reduce the mammoth helmet to a more workable, sellable size.

Having the parentage of many performances on the world's greatest stages, and a proved record of thralling audiences with the story and the music, one would expect this to be wonderful film. And it is truly wonderful. Anyone who sees this and rates it low either doesn't like musicals, or doesn't like film. This is possibly the BEST of its genre. Alan Parker took this to another level when he adapted it to the screen he managed to capture Eva Peron's rise from lowest-class in a very class-conscious culture to her status of wife of a semi-dictator. After being a dance hall girl and a radio star, Eva bloomed in her final role of First Lady--- Champion of the Underprivileged. Her early death at 33 shocked Argentina. Parker deserves much praise for this adaptation which captured the reality and the tabloid unreality of Eva Peron. The initial scene in the smoke-filled movie theater where the Argentinians are told of her passing and the sombre days afterward when her preserved body lay in state for viewing by the slowly moving queues give us a real sense how much she mattered to her countrymen and women. The outpouring of grief in the funeral march uses many of the same people, allegedly, who marched in the actual funeral procession 30 years before. The grief----of something precious taken from them, of a vital loss---has lessened, yet is still there. Parker's use of these people means he didn't have to rely on doctoring old newsreels to gain the effect of national mourning. Directorial touches like this take this movie from mere musical to biographical homage. We see, and feel more deeply how she affected others, and it is this depth that is necessary for it to be not only a filmed musical.Others have commented here how good Antonio Banderas is in his role of singing narrator, a modern adaptation of the Greek chorus who is both part of the drama, and detached commenting observer at the same time. His voice and his inflections! . . . maybe it is his Latin heritage, making him a very wise choice for the role, and maybe it is because he is just damn good here that he is so effective. His voice is beautiful, impassioned and he has a sincerity that is needed to balance the one weakness that Madonna brings to her portrayal of Eva, and that is her lack of depth. It is not that she is a bad actress... she can emote, she is polished and trained as a dancer so she moves well on screen, but she lacks some ill defined depth of character and all her supporting actors and actresses in 'Evita' help to shore up this missing ingredient in her performance.Perhaps it isn't that Madonna lacks depth for this role, so much that she is visibly 'playing' Eva Peron instead of becoming Evita, of takingon her persona. Her singing is excellent. She felt herself similar in background (clawed from poorer beginnings to the top) to Evita and campaigned for the movie role it is said. But she lacks that capacity to allow the audience to feel what she is suffering . . . that marvelous ability that great actors have, even silent Kabuki ones, to create a genuine emotional sensation in the spectators. Would this movie be even stronger had she that capacity...? Of course. And it may be that that same drive to succeed that took her to the top also works against her in this she cannot stop being who she labored so hard to become, to become someone like her. She can't get out of her own way. And this is not to denigrate her performance.. some have questioned whether Patti Lupone who played Eva on Broadway in an award-winning performance should not also have played the movie role. I don't know. I heard Lupone was great, and brought real soul to it. Maybe.Still, Madonna is very good in the role . . . if there is a lack of authenticity in her acting it is compensated by her dancing and singing and the greater authenticity of those around her. Jonathan Price as Peron is convincing. He has a slightly distant military air, and something of the father image that supposedly drew Eva to him, her own father having died when she was a child. He seems to love her, but she is also not an equal to him, less man and wife, more father and ward. There was an age difference between Eva and Peron, so this is historically accurate. The rest of the cast is unfaultable. Singing, music, couldn't be better. I love this movie. It is my favorite cinema adaptation of a musical drama. I only watched it after I had listened to the soundtrack numerous times and was truly amazed how artfully Parker interwove dramatic action and song.

I figured on it being about a businessman who secretly kills people based on looking at the DVD cover. Well, I was right. But American Psycho was different than most horror movies. This one actually had character development. I suppose one could say it's a slasher film with a story.Patrick Bateman is a business man who lives almost a perfect life.

I can imagine them leaping high though the enormous space of Notre Dame Cathedral, crashing into and out of the huge stain glass windows, smashing up all the artwork along the way until D'Artagnan skewers Richelieu on the high altar with some relic.

I am 17, and I thought the film was near-perfect, I mean I loved the overall look of the film with its gorgeous costumes, dazzling choreography and sumptuous cinematography. The script was very poetic, especially when Christian is comparing Satine, the beautiful courtesan to a sparkling diamond, and when Toulouse exclaims I hope the piano is tuned. The songs are wonderful, particularly Come What May and The Show Must Go On, and everybody in the cast does their own singing, and I honestly didn't know Ewen MacGregor could sing, he has an amazing voice. I have heard too many complaints saying there are too many songs, but do bear in mind it is a musical, and to me, being an aspiring singer, music is like poetry, and very often is the best way to describe your mood. I thought the performances were brilliant. Ewen MacGregor is very earnest and likable as always as Christian, and Nicole Kidman is both fabulously sexy and wonderfully tragic as the consumptive Satine, and the character's death scene was quite heart-rending, and was very reminiscent of the Greta Garbo movie Camille(which I will admit I like more). I also liked the performances of Jim Broadbent as the sympathetic Ziegler and Richard Roxburgh as the wily duke. However there were one or two aspects that were extremely silly, like the hilarious Can Can scene as well as the duet between Ziegler and the Duke, and compared to Jose Ferrer's more poignant portrayal as Toulouse in the 1952 version, John Leguizamo as the character mayn't be to everyone's taste.

I cried!Terrance Howard should have been nominated for an award for best supporting actor. He made this film as realistic as your reunions with your families and friends. Don't miss this!

It was well written, acted and the cast was beautiful. Though the cast was of African American actors, this is movie for all ethnic backgrounds.It tells of a group of college friends that reunite for a wedding, but the wedding itself is not the story, its a semi-fictitious book written by one of the friends. Why is the book so paramount? Its actually a true account of events that had occurred between the friends when enrolled in college.

However, for me, it isn't completely perfect, there were times when the script could have been developed a LITTLE more, and the film itself is a bit on the long side. But overall, you have a charming and entertaining movie. Richard Gere is a charming lead, and I do find him charming in everything he's in. Julia Roberts is wonderful also as Vivienne Ward, a beautiful but down on her luck sort of woman. I will confess I am not a Julia Roberts fan, but she put a lot into this film, and it showed. I was also really impressed with the supporting performances from Jason Alexander, Ralph Bellamy and Hector Elizondo. The film also has some excellent camera-work and well-intentioned direction, with a very lovely scene in the opera house, showing La Traviata, one of the world's saddest operas. The script, while a little frothy and contrived at times, still had a lot of humour and heart. Overall, I really liked this film, it made me feel good, like it promised. 8\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"5 June 2009","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Pretty Woman is a very entertaining film indeed.
