People look for an explanation and come up with plots so complex that it makes the whole thing look silly. Really silly. The actual clue here, is that there is none.This is art, ladies and gentlemen. Art in disguise, in the world of massive consumption media. It's a composition of ideas interweaving and merging into each other. Just like Monet's painting shown in the picture, featuring the 'vanilla sky', it is an impression of reality. You have to look at it the way you look back at a dream you've just woken up from. Some parts are still clear in your memory, while others have already begun to fade out of your mind. And the whole - well - makes no real sense at all. Or if you believe that dreams have a meaning, it can make any sense you would want it to have.Vanilla Sky is like one of Monet's paintings. When you examine his works at close range, they will look like assemblies of random brush strokes; as if the artist wanted to paint a surreal landscape. However, if you take a few steps back (or like in my case simply take off your glasses), you will see the colours flow into each other and something will start to take shape inside your own imagination. Something really familiar. Monet wants to depict landscapes; he describes them with colour, so that we can make up their form ourselves.Hold on to that thought, and use it to look at Vanilla Sky. Everything in it has a purpose and yet, nothing has a meaning on its own. See it as a whole, but don't be disappointed if it would turn out that the whole makes no sense to you either.

If they made Casablanca and instead of Humphrey Bogart, they had a chimpanzee playing Rick, we'd point to the chimp and tell the director, No, sorry.  You screwed up.  That chimp shouldn't be here.  It's a mistake and now your movie doesn't work.  You have to scrap this all and start again.  Baz Luhrmann needs to scrap this movie (and 'Strictly Ballroom,' too, incidentally) and start again.The problem is this there has never been a movie so exuberantly kitschy (or do I mean campy?) as Moulin Rouge Exclamation Point - but there's already some trouble brewing in the whole idea of doing something to be INTENTIONALLY outrageously kitschy.  When outlandishly dumb things happen in this movie (Boing! Whoo!), we can't chuckle and say, oh my god, can you believe how ridiculous that was? because of COURSE we can believe it - it's the whole point, after all.  If we were watching a REAL old musical, and someone started speaking the lyrics to a song, we might have something to chuckle at - what naivete!  what sweetly, pathetically sincere absurdity - but in this in-your-face movie, the dumb-ness is just part of the game, and so it's hard to see it as anything but...dumb.  I guess you have to suspend your disbelief - disbelief not that the story is real, but that the movie is naive.But that pales in comparison to the real problem, which is that once we're thinking, how outrageous and ridiculous this crazy show is! we are at the diametric opposite point on the emotional circle (as it turns out, emotions come on a circle - thought you should know) to being moved by anything. When Baz et. al. come out shouting that this is a movie about Truth, Beauty, Nutmeg and Whatever, I'm thinking, I hear ya - Boing, Whoo!, Truth!, Beauty!, I gotcha, buddy.  But then as it goes on I get this creepy feeling that he really DOES think it's about Truth, Beauty, Whatever.  Good lord. If this is a movie about people's emotions, where are the people?  Where, even, are the puppets to represent people?  All I see are bits of cultural flotsam being thrown against each other to create sparks of camp - a pretty empty show at best.What really pains me is that so many people (people I thought were my friends!  people I used to respect!) are of the same mind as Baz, and eat this movie up.  They're saying, It's so MOVING when Rick puts Ilsa on the plane and doesn't go with her - and the monkey was so FUNNY!  No.  Either this is a movie about a funny monkey, or it's a love story.  It can't be both - I can draw a diagram on paper to show you why if you don't believe me.  I KNOW there are people reading this right now thinking, he just doesn't get it - the whole point of this movie is that it uses a veneer of crazy kitschiness to get at the real live beating heart of emotion, but they are, in fact, wrong.  If you find yourself moved by the hackneyed nonsense that serves as the plot of Moulin Rouge(!), I'm happy for you, I really am - but that means you're absolutely not entitled to pretend that you understand the point of kitsch.  Unless you really don't, and you just love it all at face value!  God help us if all these Moulin Rouge! fans think the beyond-infantile 'Boing's and 'Whoo!'s are actual comedy as opposed to meta-comedy.

That's why I am genuinely sorry to report the trailer for Kung Pow is better than the film. Kung Pow is my first walkout in a couple of years.One problem I didn't foresee in watching the trailer is that the by-now over-familiar joke about bad dubbing of Asian films --which has been spoofed for the last 30 years by everyone from Woody Allen to soft drink company commercial makers-- while still enough to elicit chuckles or at least giddy good humor in a commercial length vehicle, does not work long term. After the first five minutes of Kung Pow, you are prepared for the next jokes --which arrive, the few times they do, in a very weakened form.

","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"26 January 2002","score":"24 out of 46 people found the following review useful","review":" Having never seen a Marx Brothers film before, I watched Duck Soup not knowing what to expect other than what the hype led me to believe. My impression of the Marx Brothers beforehand was that they were a more socially-accepted, somewhat highbrow version of the Three Stooges that focused more on witty jokes than slapstick. There was Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and sometimes Zeppo, with Groucho being the best-known of the bunch due to his long career on the You Bet Your Life TV show and the nose, glasses, and mustache disguise based on his appearance.I didn't think Duck Soup was terrible, certainly not enough to prevent me from checking out another Marx Brothers film some time. A few scenes involved humorous takes on traditional comic themes like mistaken identity and the man-in-the-mirror routine. But after viewing Duck Soup, it would seem that I was overestimating the Marxes. Partly to blame is the hype surrounding the film, which leads one to expect comic brilliance and intelligent satire, rather than the frequently abrasive gags to be found here (and the satire that is not to).After the unsettling title image of live ducks flailing about in what looks like a pot of steaming water, the quartet of Marxes soon makes its presence known. Zeppo is barely noticeable, and so neither good nor bad, but Chico turns out to be an Italian stereotype, and, even sadder, the star Groucho is a rude, irritating punk rather than a hilarious funnyman. A disappointment, since he is the star around whom the plot revolves. Meanwhile, the great Harpo is one of the most unlikable, unappealing physical comedians I've ever seen. I found nothing amusing or clever about his habits of leering at people and destroying their personal property, either with scissors or his own brute force. Nor was it funny to see him continually lift his leg in the air in an inexplicable manner, as if he was a dog about to pee or something.Some of the funny parts are at the end during the climactic battle. The thing is, it's just Three Stooges stuff that critics would scoff at if it appeared outside of a Marx film. Sticks of dynamite with extra-long fuses, getting locked in a closet, immobilizing the bad guy and throwing garbage in his face&#133;these are all conventions of Stooge slapstick, and in Duck Soup seem to be filmed in the same style as those shorts. I am almost positive that I've seen Moe, Larry, and Curly do a military sketch that was much the same.Many people have held this film up as a comic masterpiece and even a brilliant political satire about politics, with lots of tie-ins to fascism and the rise of Hitler, natch, although this film was made long before the Nazis went into full swing. I think that this praise is applied too liberally by adoring fans and critics who wish to appear well-informed and sophisticated and are only too willing to join the bandwagon. In his review for Duck Soup, Roger Ebert quotes some British critic named Patrick McCray who called the film an absurdist essay on politics and warfare  that  can stand alongside (or even above) the works of Beckett and Ionesco. Really, now, Beckett and Ionesco? Is Duck Soup deserving of such high regard? To me, the film seems more like a chance for a few comedian brothers to make a light comedy together, make some money, and have some fun. It's not an awful film, but not a great one, either, and certainly not a watershed in American film comedy.I could detect little pertinent satire.

My impression of the Marx Brothers beforehand was that they were a more socially-accepted, somewhat highbrow version of the Three Stooges that focused more on witty jokes than slapstick. There was Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and sometimes Zeppo, with Groucho being the best-known of the bunch due to his long career on the You Bet Your Life TV show and the nose, glasses, and mustache disguise based on his appearance.I didn't think Duck Soup was terrible, certainly not enough to prevent me from checking out another Marx Brothers film some time. A few scenes involved humorous takes on traditional comic themes like mistaken identity and the man-in-the-mirror routine. But after viewing Duck Soup, it would seem that I was overestimating the Marxes. Partly to blame is the hype surrounding the film, which leads one to expect comic brilliance and intelligent satire, rather than the frequently abrasive gags to be found here (and the satire that is not to).After the unsettling title image of live ducks flailing about in what looks like a pot of steaming water, the quartet of Marxes soon makes its presence known. Zeppo is barely noticeable, and so neither good nor bad, but Chico turns out to be an Italian stereotype, and, even sadder, the star Groucho is a rude, irritating punk rather than a hilarious funnyman. A disappointment, since he is the star around whom the plot revolves. Meanwhile, the great Harpo is one of the most unlikable, unappealing physical comedians I've ever seen. I found nothing amusing or clever about his habits of leering at people and destroying their personal property, either with scissors or his own brute force. Nor was it funny to see him continually lift his leg in the air in an inexplicable manner, as if he was a dog about to pee or something.Some of the funny parts are at the end during the climactic battle. The thing is, it's just Three Stooges stuff that critics would scoff at if it appeared outside of a Marx film. Sticks of dynamite with extra-long fuses, getting locked in a closet, immobilizing the bad guy and throwing garbage in his face&#133;these are all conventions of Stooge slapstick, and in Duck Soup seem to be filmed in the same style as those shorts. I am almost positive that I've seen Moe, Larry, and Curly do a military sketch that was much the same.Many people have held this film up as a comic masterpiece and even a brilliant political satire about politics, with lots of tie-ins to fascism and the rise of Hitler, natch, although this film was made long before the Nazis went into full swing. I think that this praise is applied too liberally by adoring fans and critics who wish to appear well-informed and sophisticated and are only too willing to join the bandwagon. In his review for Duck Soup, Roger Ebert quotes some British critic named Patrick McCray who called the film an absurdist essay on politics and warfare  that  can stand alongside (or even above) the works of Beckett and Ionesco. Really, now, Beckett and Ionesco? Is Duck Soup deserving of such high regard? To me, the film seems more like a chance for a few comedian brothers to make a light comedy together, make some money, and have some fun. It's not an awful film, but not a great one, either, and certainly not a watershed in American film comedy.I could detect little pertinent satire.

Hannigan and Biggs have fantastic chemistry and play off one another so well that they could have been a vaudeville act.  Eugene Levy is marvelous as Jim's well meaning but hopelessly square dad.This film meanders a great deal and misses the freshness of the first film, but is still packed with plenty of fun.

One thing I hate to see are people accusing this movie as of being racist, and patriotic. To touch the subject of it `being' racist, for those who say this, I think, may not be sure, but I think it is because of the way the Somalian militia are portrayed in this movie. Now people have said it shows them being barbaric savages. People say it's a misinterpretation, but if we remember, the Somalian militia did grab those two pilot bodies and drag them through the streets, they stepped andkicked the bodies, spit on the bodies, and basically tore the body apart. Now if that is not a barbaric savage act, then I have no idea what it is then. But if your saying that you take the side of that militia that did that to those pilots, then you are being racist towards the American soldiers. I remember, I was about 7 to 8 years old, it was 1993 and I remember watching CNN the day after the events. I walked into the room while my parents were looking at this savage act. I glanced at the television and saw the bodies of those pilots being torn and kicked. It was the first time I had ever seen a dead body. It was the first time I learned how much hatred there was in the world. Even at that early age I though of that soldiers family, and how they must feel at seeing this. Now if you say that the way that militia was shown in the movie is a racist act, then you have just proven to everyone you're an idiot. Wars are about killing people, and the way a side wins is by killing people. It doesn't matter what skin color they are. Now to get to those who say this is just a patriotic movie. The movie is not about America being better. The movie is not about the politics. The movie is not even about the battle, but what happened to the people in that battle. Meaning that it was what would you do if you were in that event? What would you do if your friend is in trouble? The movie is about the fellowship of your fellow soldiers. The movie shows what extraordinary things sticking together can do. The tag line of the movie is `Leave No Man Behind'. The movie does not go into politics whether America should have gone in there, or showing the flag of hope. The movie is about the friends you make. And if you do not agree, then you either did not watch movie, or you have no idea what was going on in that movie. Black Hawk Down is an outstanding movie about soldiers in a war. It is second to Saving Private Ryan. The movie truly shows the chaos in war. And on a plus, the actors, even Josh Hartnett did an extremely perfect job in the movie. I give this movie 10 out of 10.

And if you do not agree, then you either did not watch movie, or you have no idea what was going on in that movie. Black Hawk Down is an outstanding movie about soldiers in a war. It is second to Saving Private Ryan. The movie truly shows the chaos in war. And on a plus, the actors, even Josh Hartnett did an extremely perfect job in the movie. I give this movie 10 out of 10. A PERFECT SCORE!  ","genre":null},{"date":"26 January 2002","score":"","review":"  A great movie that is consistently being put down by idiotic accusations, BLACK HAWK DOWN is outstanding. One thing I hate to see are people accusing this movie as of being racist, and patriotic. To touch the subject of it `being' racist, for those who say this, I think, may not be sure, but I think it is because of the way the Somalian militia are portrayed in this movie. Now people have said it shows them being barbaric savages. People say it's a misinterpretation, but if we remember, the Somalian militia did grab those two pilot bodies and drag them through the streets, they stepped andkicked the bodies, spit on the bodies, and basically tore the body apart. Now if that is not a barbaric savage act, then I have no idea what it is then. But if your saying that you take the side of that militia that did that to those pilots, then you are being racist towards the American soldiers. I remember, I was about 7 to 8 years old, it was 1993 and I remember watching CNN the day after the events. I walked into the room while my parents were looking at this savage act. I glanced at the television and saw the bodies of those pilots being torn and kicked. It was the first time I had ever seen a dead body. It was the first time I learned how much hatred there was in the world. Even at that early age I though of that soldiers family, and how they must feel at seeing this. Now if you say that the way that militia was shown in the movie is a racist act, then you have just proven to everyone you're an idiot. Wars are about killing people, and the way a side wins is by killing people. It doesn't matter what skin color they are. Now to get to those who say this is just a patriotic movie. The movie is not about America being better. The movie is not about the politics. The movie is not even about the battle, but what happened to the people in that battle. Meaning that it was what would you do if you were in that event? What would you do if your friend is in trouble? The movie is about the fellowship of your fellow soldiers. The movie shows what extraordinary things sticking together can do. The tag line of the movie is `Leave No Man Behind'. The movie does not go into politics whether America should have gone in there, or showing the flag of hope. The movie is about the friends you make. And if you do not agree, then you either did not watch movie, or you have no idea what was going on in that movie. Black Hawk Down is an outstanding movie about soldiers in a war.

If you want a chick-flick, tearjerker, or date movie, this one is a good choice; also, if you're of the target audience (teenage girls, Christians, or Nicholas Sparks fans), you might like it too. Why it's good 1) Shane West and Mandy Moore can act, and they have great chemistry together.  I think this is basically why it's better than, say Here on Earth (which is what this film is being compared to in other mean, nasty reviews in newspapers I've read so far). 2) It's a HUGE tearjerker!!! 3) It gives you a warm fuzzy feeling, like it gives you hope when you see a character like Jaime Sullivan who's actually a good person. 4) For teen girls, there's always Shane West 5) For Mandy Moore fans, there's Mandy Moore 6) Christians will like the fact that the Christian Jaime is portrayed in a good light- she's also a strong character and has a sense of humour in her comebacks to school bullys. 7) I can't really vouch for how similar the movie was to the book, since I haven't read it, but I've heard, although there are changes that happens with every book-turning-into-a-movie, it stays true to the themes and feelings from the original novel. Now, bad things 1) It's quite mushy\/corny 2) You COULD argue it was done before in Here on Earth. 3) If you're a male, you could be in a potentially embarassing situation because the audience was about 95% female when I went to the theater. Well, that's my bad reasons list.  Yeah, a bit biased, wasn't I?  I have to say, there were moments when everyone was sighing, or sobbing, or saying awwwwww!  I guess you can tell I really liked it.  It was good!
