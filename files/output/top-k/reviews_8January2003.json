Dahl's books for children are phenomenally successful in this country; a kind of dry, larger-than-life misanthropy comes through in most of books, along with some moralizing, that tends to exclusively take the child's side. He is a very skilled writer, and adapts his book with pretty much all of the black humour and colourful anarchy intact.Yes, some musical sequences are a trifle stilted; Cheer Up Charlie just doesn't work in any satisfactory way. In very much a 60s-early 70s musical way, Bricusse and Newley's Candy Man and Imagination work, but are not especially brilliant, or enhancing. The Oompa Lumpas' songs and Veruca Salt's precocious, petulant number are pretty good, mind, and really develop the film's moral basis.Set design is truly the strength of the film, appealingly and at times surreally visualizing the Chocolate Factory. Of course, Gene Wilder is the other coup d'etat of the production; coming over as a maniacal, wondrous and deadpan presence. Much of the appeal this film holds for older viewers has to go down to Wilder's wonderfully pitched Wonka he really defines the part and defies one to think of anyone else in it. Julie Dawn Cole is the most impressive of the juvenile actors; coming over as the ultimate petulant, nigh-on demonic brat of a child. Her comeuppance is lovingly signposted in her musical sequence and then the dispatching. Each child who fails the test is amusingly and quite disturbingly dispatched by a diffident, sardonic Wonka, and then we are given quite sublime little epigrammatic songs by the Oompa Lumpas stating the moral. Some heady stuff for a children's film - Who's to blame?\/It's the MOTHER AND THE FATHER!Some eccentric aspects of the book become a little odd on film, like the whole family set-up of the Buckets. Grandpa Joe, as enacted in the flesh, comes across as an increasingly questionable figure - his past laziness seems incorrigibly absurd, and he's seen to touch up some other female attendant of one of the children, when they are in a lift - What are you doing?! she says. Very curious stuff! Charlie is a simpering bland child who I suppose will do; really it's what you'd expect in a story which has to portray a quite simple idea of virtue and goodness. His being a blue-eyed Aryan child and Grandpa Joe and the rest of the lethargic family being quite obvious American Jews is slightly singular. The setting of the film is another thing; where is Wonka's factory and where does this American Bucket family live? The direction, by Mel Stuart, is maybe at times pedestrian... this is an area where maybe things could have been furthered, but it's an inoffensive, acceptable direction of the film really.As sure as Alastair Cooke being on the BBC, I liked this film. I can find few flaws as to its achieving what it sets out to do. The original book and concept maybe has its flaws to an older viewer, but it's damn well delicious stuff for any child, and there are too few films of which you can say that. The set designers and Gene Wilder really deserve bounteous praise for great efforts which lift the whole thing to its quality.Rating- ****\/***** ","genre":null},{"date":"8 January 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Quite the cult film these days, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory deserves its plaudits, as a well-judged translation of Roald Dahl to film.

This film is not a pop corn movie, it presents a sophisticated insight into a conceptual analysis of dreams and hallucination elements. It is not depicted in an obvious manner but it's this that makes this film unique.I recognised this films' beauty in hind sight. It did come a little difficult to watch towards the end but this was because I missed the point of the film. The second viewing made it much easier and I enjoyed this more now understanding the concept.There are some fantastic scenes in this film that are second to none. The 'surreal' dream concept was played beautifully and to capture this idea without the use of special effects is a work of genius.Watch the film carefully, enjoy it, don't blink, talk, pause the movie or make a cup of tea.

The main problem that i had with the film is that it tried to be a theological story and an action film at the same time. By trying to be one it undermines the other. The conspiracy theory is just getting tired no matter how much enthusiasim it is made with. There was way too much slow motion, Hard Boiled also suffered from this, Bullet Time was a nice idea and the technological improvements deserve credit. The idea of intergrating man and machine while not origional was done well. The use of a suppressd soceity was alright but is getting boring as we know that we are monitered blah, blah, we had that in the eighties. Also the use of Christianity gets tiring, art as a whole was confined to religious subjects then escaped, please don't go backwards! Unless it's Monty Python and the Holy Grail! The Wachowski brothers should be comended for their efforts and enthusiasim, as well as dry humour and style but they tried to do too much in one film. As an action film it's stylish and cool, but as a story and drama it just looses it's way. Also the cast were too confined as they couldnt do this and couldnt do that as it was for Neo to do as he is The one. This to me what ruined it as the supporting cast did a really good job, Trinity at the start, operator throughout. Watch this as an action film and be bowled over by the effects, some really clever techniques but don't expect and easy ride if you try to negotiate the story, as a conspiracy story it works, as a suppression of soceity story it works, but as a theological thriller it fails, Keanu Reeves once again stuck in a role that gives little open development, only in relation to the plot, how about the romance with Trinity, or saving Morpheus.Special effects, do not a great movie make. They do allow you to shut down and enjoy, but with the nature of the story it destroys what makes it enjoyable. Just skip to the action scenes. The bit where the water sprinklers come on made me laugh as the agents just stand there as if Hmm, i'm wet now - must kill Neo!THis fil mhas gone up in my opinion but still does not sustain all the hype it got. It's a good laugh and fun to watch with mates, but with religious paralles it takes away the fun, pity. 3\/10 up to 6\/7 out of 10.
