The performance of Richard Jordan as Lo Armistead must be singled out for praise - his anguish was very moving. I'd loved the actor in The Friends of Eddie Coyle and what a job he does. (It helps that he's given the best lines in the movie). Martin Sheen as Robt. E. Lee is not the first name that would come to mind - but I think he gave a fine performance - his accent was entrancing. Sam Elliott is perfectly chosen as (and wonderfully played) the western General John Buford. I also think Jeff Daniels was absolutely wonderful - conveying so well the different manner of someone who until a year before, had been a civilian professor, not a colonel. Unfortunately although I'm generally a fan of Tom Berenger, I wasn't particularly moved by any scene he was in - he kind of walks through it.The movie is written so well - and its pace just fine. There are so many interesting scenes, touching on many different aspects of life and war - from the nature of man and race to the paradox of a general loving his army yet having to sacrifice it. Jordan brought home so well the closeness of the senior officers to those on the other side. I loved how well they showed the varied purposes for fighting of the different armies, and the occasional reference to a perceived resentment by the Union soldiers over what they saw as Confederate pretensions to higher social class. (They're so arrogant, etc.). The music is first rate - and definitely enhances the drama. The depiction seems quite authentic. Some niggling criticisms aside from the map at the start of the movie, there is none. Maps would definitely have helped to undeerstand the overall picture. People commonly refer to directions (from the norht, from the west, etc.) or we must flank them to the right and it's hard to understand if you haven't read about the battle.The scene with the runaway slave is too abbreviated from the book - it doesn't have much impact in the movie. Kevin Conway's dialogue and accent was a bit over the top, and the English military attache was rather clicheed.For all that General Hancock is referenced, we see very little of him.We see the diatribe by General Trimble against General Ewell - but without seeing anything of that battle (or Ewell ever), it just hangs there - rather than being part of any continuous story. (In the book, Ewell's and Early's conduct is more discussed - including a wonderful scene by the two with Lee). If they weren't going to discuss that side of the battle, they should have left Trimble's (well-played) trembling anger out of the story - it doesn't belong in this movie.Gen. Longstreet is the star of the book and movie - yet I never sensed from Berenger the great brooding quality (and he wasn't given any reference to the fact that his thre children had just died) that he has throughout the battle - according to the book. Similarly, Gen. Lee's health (his heart and headaches, etc.) is a constant factor - not shown in the movie.Despite the criticisms, this is a wonderfully done movie - from a Pulitzer Prize winning book. It's long - but quite clear, and very deeply moving. I defy anyone to see the last 1\/2 hour and not have tears in their eyes. I'd very strongly recommend this.

John C. Riley is one of the most underused actors around (yes, he is underused - bit parts are not good enough for him), and it is great to see him in a film where he is let loose by the director. His role as the do-good cop is great, whose constant need to help people makes it no wonder he went for the coke-head with lots of personal problems. To me, this movie needed a little more resolution in some of the subplots, but I suppose with a run time of 2 hours and 59 minutes, they figured they were done. When I watched this movie for the first time, I never noticed the time, and was expecting at least another 30 minutes. People often ask me, What is this movie about?, people often ask me, people afraid of a 3 hour movie. Despite the accusations of lesser educated individuals that this is a boring move with no plot, this is in no way a film like that, and if they cared to pay attention for a little longer and with a little more brain power than is required by the average John Woo joint, they would see a film that easily would end up somewhere in their 'top 5 all time favorite'. The movie can be summed up easily, and this is what I tell the aforementioned sheep when arguing about this movie - 'Everything can be suddenly affected by amazing events, and we are naive and persistent in that we still try to plan our lives'. This movie is about life, death, love, hate, deceit, crime, greed, and guilt, and how they all intertwine in everybody's life all the time wether they want it to or not. As for the plot, there is quite clearly one main plot - Earl Partridge is dying, and wants to see his son again, who he has not seen in many years since cheating on his wife and then walking out. The son, Frank T. J. Mackey, does not really want to see him, and we see by what he does for a living that this character is greatly affected by his fathers' earlier actions. There are several subplots stemming from the life of Earl Partridge (except the cop) - we see the life of a game show host who works for Earl's television station - we see the life of one of the game show's contestants, a brilliant child with an overbearing father - we see the life of Donnie Smith, who was a winning child contestant on the same show 30 years ago - we see the life of Earl's May-December wife - and we see the life of Officer Kurring, who exists to bring hope and help to each character he sees. As for the event many claim is a movie cop-out to bring the characters together, ask yourself - did the characters even needed to be brought together? And weren't they all in the process of being brought together anyway despite the event? If you follow - the mother was already on her way to see the daughter, the cop was already turning around to confront Donnie Smith, the kid was already freaked out by what happened on the game show, and the Frank was already with his father.

Sure its one heck of a film especially back in the day when it was made. It had great costumes and makeup with great music by Jerry Goldsmith and a tremendous shocking end. This Planet of the Apes has awesome costumes and very realistic makeup and\/or masks. The music is outstanding by Danny Elfman and the 2001 version has even a more shocking end. It seems to Me many people are against or hate this POTA. I really don't know why, it has such an interesting cast and they play their parts very well and sure it may not be director Tim Burton's darkest film but in My opinion it is one heck of movie! The way I see the film it has a lot of emotion and all of the characters are so likable. I'll try to explain this as best as I can about Helena Bonham Carter is a very good looking woman and her character Ari is beautiful. I know she is under tons of makeup and looks very realistic as an ape but whenever she is on screen I can't help but think how neat she is with her voice and personality. Tim Roth's Thade is an awesome character and his character deserves a lot more credit. Roth's performance is truly menacing. Charlton Heston put on another solid performance as Thade's father. Another thing that gets into this movie so much is the music. Each scene is so great with the fantastic score! Below is in My opinions an in-depth look at most of the characters that is in the 2001 Planet of the Apes!-------------Mark Wahlberg as Captain Leo Davidson - Leo Davidson, after the incident of going after Pericles he is stranded on another world thanks to a magnetic storm. The planet he lands on has unbelievable talking apes. He is prisoner but after Ari frees him he gets to know her and her mentor, Krull and some other humans. He joins these two different factions of intelligent species and travels to the forbidden area Calima! Leo is out for himself and to go back home as soon as he can!Tim Roth as General Thade - The great General Thade, a mighty warrior who is afraid of nothing. His mean voice sends shivers down his soldiers back and he hates humans to death!Thade and Ari were once in a relationship but now Ari has other things to do. He loves his father Zaius very much and he is very saddened about his father's illness. Helena Bonham Carter as Ari - She is a beautiful ape and very intelligent as well. She helps Leo escape. She is through with Thade and even though she has feelings for Leo even though he is human. She loves Krull as he is her mentor and in fact he is with Ari all the way with her,Leo,and other escapees from the city.Michael Clarke Duncan as Colonel Attar - The huge Attar is a force to reckon with! He is General Thade's great warrior and best friend. He is a very religious and serious ape.Paul Giamatti as Limbo -  The always funny Limbo loves to smell and look good. The human keeper if you will takes his job seriously but when he is forced to follow the escapees his life turns around. Estella Warren as Daena - One of the many prisoners in Ape City,Daena wants out just as much as everyone else but when she meets up with Leo and escapes with the group she has feelings for him but much like he does for Ari he doesn't think much of it. She loves her father Karubi very much and she is shocked and very sad about his death.Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Krull - The massive Krull was one of the greatest warriors and a brave leader. He is the mentor of Ari and he is one of the apes who is in the escaped group. His favorite weapons are swords and handles them excellently!David Warner as Senator Sandar - Ari's father, Senator Sandar let Thade have control. He is an ape that believes in manners such as washing hands. He tries not to get on Thade's case and he loves his daughter Ari.Kris Kristofferson as Karubi -  The father of Daena,Karubi loves  his daughter very much. He is a brave human man but his death in a fight against Attar didn't last long and he never knew what hit him from behind which it was General Thade.Thade's sword decapitated him.Erick Avari as Tival - The male house human is one of the escapees in the group with humans and apes.Luke Eberl as Birn - A stubborn teenager, Birn is a brave young man.Evan Dexter Parke as Gunnar - Another escaped male human. He too is brave.Glenn Shadix as Senator Nado - The great senator Nado. He loves his job and his mate!Freda Foh Shen as Bon - The female house human is one of the escapees in the group with humans and apes.Chris Ellis as Lt. General Karl Vasich -  Leader of the Oberon.When the  magnetic storm caused malfuctions in the ship a video image played on the monitor. Little does he know that what he just saw was himself in the future!Anne Ramsay as Lt. Col. Grace Alexander - She really cared for the modern day apes in the Oberon.Lisa Marie as Nova - Senator Nado's mate. She is very attractive for an ape and she is always worried about her looks.Linda Harrison as Woman in Cart - Could it be possible that this woman was on another planet at another time or in another lifetime? Could it be that she is reincarnated?Charlton Heston as Zaius,Thade's Father - Thade's father is very ill. Before he passes he wants to make sure to tell and show his son the shocking truth about humans.---------------I just like how everything is in the film. The ending may have been rushed and not make sense to others because it really had several endings but Burton could only pick one. In fact you can also tell as great as the music is if you listen closely some of the tracks are alternatives than the released music on the CD. Also a short time before the final release of the film the producers wanted the movie to be more epic than it was and they wanted it to be like or more like Gladiator and back to the music they wanted the composer Danny Elfman to change the music. I thought it was silly for the movie makers to do that and I am glad it came out the way it did even if the ending is sad and is a mistake or an error. I hope you have enjoyed this in-depth look at Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes. Like I said I love the 2001 version!

I hope you have enjoyed this in-depth look at Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes. Like I said I love the 2001 version! ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"22 February 2003","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  Many people think that the original 1967 Planet of the Apes is a classic and a master piece. Sure its one heck of a film especially back in the day when it was made. It had great costumes and makeup with great music by Jerry Goldsmith and a tremendous shocking end. This Planet of the Apes has awesome costumes and very realistic makeup and\/or masks. The music is outstanding by Danny Elfman and the 2001 version has even a more shocking end. It seems to Me many people are against or hate this POTA. I really don't know why, it has such an interesting cast and they play their parts very well and sure it may not be director Tim Burton's darkest film but in My opinion it is one heck of movie! The way I see the film it has a lot of emotion and all of the characters are so likable. I'll try to explain this as best as I can about Helena Bonham Carter is a very good looking woman and her character Ari is beautiful. I know she is under tons of makeup and looks very realistic as an ape but whenever she is on screen I can't help but think how neat she is with her voice and personality. Tim Roth's Thade is an awesome character and his character deserves a lot more credit. Roth's performance is truly menacing. Charlton Heston put on another solid performance as Thade's father. Another thing that gets into this movie so much is the music. Each scene is so great with the fantastic score! Below is in My opinions an in-depth look at most of the characters that is in the 2001 Planet of the Apes!-------------Mark Wahlberg as Captain Leo Davidson - Leo Davidson, after the incident of going after Pericles he is stranded on another world thanks to a magnetic storm. The planet he lands on has unbelievable talking apes. He is prisoner but after Ari frees him he gets to know her and her mentor, Krull and some other humans. He joins these two different factions of intelligent species and travels to the forbidden area Calima! Leo is out for himself and to go back home as soon as he can!Tim Roth as General Thade - The great General Thade, a mighty warrior who is afraid of nothing. His mean voice sends shivers down his soldiers back and he hates humans to death!Thade and Ari were once in a relationship but now Ari has other things to do. He loves his father Zaius very much and he is very saddened about his father's illness. Helena Bonham Carter as Ari - She is a beautiful ape and very intelligent as well. She helps Leo escape. She is through with Thade and even though she has feelings for Leo even though he is human. She loves Krull as he is her mentor and in fact he is with Ari all the way with her,Leo,and other escapees from the city.Michael Clarke Duncan as Colonel Attar - The huge Attar is a force to reckon with! He is General Thade's great warrior and best friend. He is a very religious and serious ape.Paul Giamatti as Limbo -  The always funny Limbo loves to smell and look good. The human keeper if you will takes his job seriously but when he is forced to follow the escapees his life turns around. Estella Warren as Daena - One of the many prisoners in Ape City,Daena wants out just as much as everyone else but when she meets up with Leo and escapes with the group she has feelings for him but much like he does for Ari he doesn't think much of it. She loves her father Karubi very much and she is shocked and very sad about his death.Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Krull - The massive Krull was one of the greatest warriors and a brave leader. He is the mentor of Ari and he is one of the apes who is in the escaped group. His favorite weapons are swords and handles them excellently!David Warner as Senator Sandar - Ari's father, Senator Sandar let Thade have control. He is an ape that believes in manners such as washing hands. He tries not to get on Thade's case and he loves his daughter Ari.Kris Kristofferson as Karubi -  The father of Daena,Karubi loves  his daughter very much.

I'm interested now in seeing Delicatessen and Amelie.The basic story is this a man, The One (Ron Perlman), has his little brother, Denree, stolen from him and taken to a strange place that looks like an oil rig, where he will be used by an evil old man, Krank, for the purpose of stealing his dreams. That's basically all I got from the plot, which is, well, a bit difficult to understand. (There was something about Krank not being able to cry, how it represented his soul or lack thereof...whatever.) There are other things two old women, twins, who are after the children, some people who I assume work for Krank, that look somewhat like Borgs from Star Trek. The One meets a young girl, Miette (crumb, in English), who eventually helps him on his quest to rescue Denree. There's also some guy, Marcellus, who has a flea that injects an evil green liquid into people, turning them into angry killing machines once music from a jack-in-the-box instrument with the crank on the side starts to play.The One, as played by Perlman, is like a great big little kid -- a foreigner, probably Russian as Perlman notes on the commentary --  and there are some touching moments in the movie, like when he offers to be Miette's big brother. Up in the oil rig (or whatever), Krank is surrounded by a handful of clones (Dominique Pinon, who also plays a submarine professor) and a short little lady. Oh yeah, there's a floating brain, in what looks like pickle brine, called Uncle Irvin. Now, I never quite figured out who made whom but it's not really that important. After about 45 minutes it gets less confusing, more interesting and more involving. This movie is all about visceral, visual impact and at least on the visual level, there's no complaints. Shot by Darius Khondji, who did Se7en, the movie looks great; there's a focus on the contrast between faces -- either craggy and impish or young, wide-eyed and innocent. The set\/art design is sumptuous to look at and it, as well as the special effects, blend seamlessly into the picture.With the focus on visuals, and not the hard-to-understand plot, the film would work almost as a silent movie. I had the first few minutes of the film playing without subtitles. (Here's something I don't know exactly how subtitles work, but wouldn't it be nice, if possible, to place them over the black bars in widescreen, rather than on the picture? If they need to be on the picture for some reason -- if they're interconnected or something -- then color me stupid.)The style of the film is somewhat expressionistic and surreal. In dreams, the camera bends and becomes fluid. In one of the more wacky moments (more wacky, because the whole movie is sort of wacky), there's a strange dance within a dream between Miette and Krank, where he seems to be robbing her of her youthful essence. I can see various influences from Burton, Gilliam, Coen(s) and Lynch. I've heard that there is some Fellini influence, and that may be true (I haven't seen any of his movies but I've got 8 1\/2 on tape, so don't scream at me!). I would lump Jeunet together with Guillermo Del Toro they've both done strange variations on genre movies, giving them a unique twist and they look fabulous (they both like Ron Perlman, too).The film has a lovely, dreamy, evocative score that reminded me of Lynch and I gave myself a pat on the back when, in the commentary, Jeunet said it was indeed by Angelo Badalamenti, Lynch's longtime collaborator.With a budget of 18 million, this movie puts other big-budget fantasy movies to shame; it looks as if it could have cost five times that much. Also, why would people go see a Hollywood fantasy\/child movie like the cruddy ones Hollywood serves up monthly, when artistically credible, highly original (organ stairs?) movies like this are available? (I admit, the subtitles may pose a problem to young viewers. Maybe this would be one time where the equivalent of cinematic rape -- watching a foreign-language movie with English dubbing, rather than English subtitles -- would be an option.)To the people (or person, I only saw one note of it) who compare this movie to Spielberg, I say feh. This movie isn't sentimental, it's not one of those movies where the young kids look adorable and then get shamelessly put in situations of peril. In fact, Denree looks more than happy after he's kidnapped, eating people's dinner. There are cute little kids here, but they're not sympathy devices.There were some nice lines in the movie, my favorite being when the little lady is shot with a harpoon and has one of the clones ask her, Does it hurt? To which she replies, Yes. I'm allergic to steel.***1\/2 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 February 2003","score":"","review":"  This is my first Jean-Pierre Jeunet film not in English (I've seen Alien Resurrection, which I thought was just as much fun as any of the Alien movies).

After about 45 minutes it gets less confusing, more interesting and more involving. This movie is all about visceral, visual impact and at least on the visual level, there's no complaints. Shot by Darius Khondji, who did Se7en, the movie looks great; there's a focus on the contrast between faces -- either craggy and impish or young, wide-eyed and innocent. The set\/art design is sumptuous to look at and it, as well as the special effects, blend seamlessly into the picture.With the focus on visuals, and not the hard-to-understand plot, the film would work almost as a silent movie. I had the first few minutes of the film playing without subtitles. (Here's something I don't know exactly how subtitles work, but wouldn't it be nice, if possible, to place them over the black bars in widescreen, rather than on the picture? If they need to be on the picture for some reason -- if they're interconnected or something -- then color me stupid.)The style of the film is somewhat expressionistic and surreal. In dreams, the camera bends and becomes fluid. In one of the more wacky moments (more wacky, because the whole movie is sort of wacky), there's a strange dance within a dream between Miette and Krank, where he seems to be robbing her of her youthful essence. I can see various influences from Burton, Gilliam, Coen(s) and Lynch. I've heard that there is some Fellini influence, and that may be true (I haven't seen any of his movies but I've got 8 1\/2 on tape, so don't scream at me!). I would lump Jeunet together with Guillermo Del Toro they've both done strange variations on genre movies, giving them a unique twist and they look fabulous (they both like Ron Perlman, too).The film has a lovely, dreamy, evocative score that reminded me of Lynch and I gave myself a pat on the back when, in the commentary, Jeunet said it was indeed by Angelo Badalamenti, Lynch's longtime collaborator.With a budget of 18 million, this movie puts other big-budget fantasy movies to shame; it looks as if it could have cost five times that much. Also, why would people go see a Hollywood fantasy\/child movie like the cruddy ones Hollywood serves up monthly, when artistically credible, highly original (organ stairs?) movies like this are available? (I admit, the subtitles may pose a problem to young viewers. Maybe this would be one time where the equivalent of cinematic rape -- watching a foreign-language movie with English dubbing, rather than English subtitles -- would be an option.)To the people (or person, I only saw one note of it) who compare this movie to Spielberg, I say feh. This movie isn't sentimental, it's not one of those movies where the young kids look adorable and then get shamelessly put in situations of peril. In fact, Denree looks more than happy after he's kidnapped, eating people's dinner. There are cute little kids here, but they're not sympathy devices.There were some nice lines in the movie, my favorite being when the little lady is shot with a harpoon and has one of the clones ask her, Does it hurt? To which she replies, Yes. I'm allergic to steel.***1\/2 ","genre":"Fantasy, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"22 February 2003","score":"","review":"  This is my first Jean-Pierre Jeunet film not in English (I've seen Alien Resurrection, which I thought was just as much fun as any of the Alien movies). I'm interested now in seeing Delicatessen and Amelie.The basic story is this a man, The One (Ron Perlman), has his little brother, Denree, stolen from him and taken to a strange place that looks like an oil rig, where he will be used by an evil old man, Krank, for the purpose of stealing his dreams. That's basically all I got from the plot, which is, well, a bit difficult to understand. (There was something about Krank not being able to cry, how it represented his soul or lack thereof...whatever.) There are other things two old women, twins, who are after the children, some people who I assume work for Krank, that look somewhat like Borgs from Star Trek. The One meets a young girl, Miette (crumb, in English), who eventually helps him on his quest to rescue Denree. There's also some guy, Marcellus, who has a flea that injects an evil green liquid into people, turning them into angry killing machines once music from a jack-in-the-box instrument with the crank on the side starts to play.The One, as played by Perlman, is like a great big little kid -- a foreigner, probably Russian as Perlman notes on the commentary --  and there are some touching moments in the movie, like when he offers to be Miette's big brother. Up in the oil rig (or whatever), Krank is surrounded by a handful of clones (Dominique Pinon, who also plays a submarine professor) and a short little lady.

Everything about this film is absolutely perfect. It's really a shame that Chinatown came out the same year as The Godfather Part II (which is my favorite movie ever) and only got an original screenplay Oscar-virtually ANY OTHER YEAR it would have easily gotten Best Picture and Director, and who knows what else.The story alone makes this a classic thriller. Robert Towne really put together an incredible screenplay, which requires you to pay close attention to figure out everything happening but is worth every bit of the effort. As all the pieces of the puzzle come together, the film just gets more and more mesmerizing. The dialogue is incredible; I can count on one hand the number of films I've seen that were as quotable. The highlights are the exchanges between Gittes and Cross, as well as the famous scene with Gittes and Evelyn. The film remains incredibly absorbing right up until the devastating finale. Polanski had to fight Towne to put that ending on there, but for good reason. This ending left me horrified, but Chinatown just would not have been the same movie without it. Polanski directs the entire thing brilliantly-he evokes so many different emotions out of the viewers just right and leaves us with the feeling that we have just been exposed to events that should have remained hidden, if only to prevent emotional scars.The acting is uniformly excellent, from the leads to Escobar and Yelburton to Evelyn's servants to the farmers in the San Fernando Valley, and everyone in between. That includes the director himself in a very gory cameo. I want to talk about the leads. Jack Nicholson is an actor who I used to think was very overrated. I'd primarily seen his films in the past 15 years or so, and thought he always played himself, complete with grinning and rudeness. When I saw Chinatown though, I was blown away. There is one scene where he's telling the dirty joke and seems like JACK, but other than that there is not a trace of the regular character. Gittes is a cynical, wounded private eye who at first is simply trying to make a living, then clear his name, and then finds himself in love and wanting to care and protect in spite of himself. Nicholson nails every aspect of the performance, and after watching him here I went out to see other early works of his such as Five Easy Pieces. John Houston is also exceptional, playing one of the most contemptible villains ever, and my guess as to the reason he wasn't nominated for Best Supporting Actor is simply because the Academy hated his character far too much.However, I think Faye Dunaway deserves the most praise here. She delivers one of the best performances I've ever seen by an actress in any movie. At first Evelyn is so icy (I've heard some even call her a femme fatale, even though that label is certainly not appropriate once you watch the entire film) and we wonder what she could possibly be hiding. Then later we see that she is in great pain, but can only wonder why. I was especially moved by her when she softly told Gittes Please believe me; I would never have hurt Hollis. He was the kindest most gentle man and you wouldn't believe what he had to go through for me. After the revelation, I found myself never having cared about a movie character more. I haven't seen Dunaway's other starring roles, but it's clear why she was one of the top actresses of the 1970s, and I'm glad she won Best Actress for Network two years after this.I've made an effort not to spoil anything in this remarkable film.
