It's been tried many times, but, for some reason, Tarentino can pull it off time after time. I'm sure you haven't seen a movie quite like this one before.It's actually a bunch of stories put together in one movie, but, yet, they're all connected. It's not that any of the stories are completely original, it's just the way the movie is put together. It's non linear, for one thing. You see the end of the story at the beginning of the movie and the rest of the scenes are out of place as well, but somehow it all works. In the hands of someone other than Tarentino, I'm sure it would have been a huge mess.The thing that's best about Tarentino is the dialog. He has the best knack out of all writers to create believable everyday dialog that's still interesting. As a person who's dabbled in writing, it is difficult to create good, authentic dialog, without boring the reader. If you've ever listened to two people talk in a restaurant or something, you'll know what I mean - dull as a felt tip marker. Tarentino can create authentic sounding dialog without making it boring. This movie is worth watching just for that.The acting was very well done and most of the characters were original and non-stereotyped. Travolta was particularly good and showed he was capable of doing drama as well as comedies and musicals.If you want to see something different, this is one you don't want to miss. It well deserves to be in the top 100 on the IMDb list.

Yeah, I thought not.Sure, everyone's seen the movie. But here are a few facts about it you might not know.The original Broadway production was a hit, but the music was REALLY hokey and many of the songs were different.Can you imagine a movie musical being made today from a musical where new songs are added that are BETTER than the originals? Grease (the opener), Sandy, Hopelessly Devoted and You're the One That I Want are all new for the movie, and all are now classics.It's fun to watch the Pink Ladies scenes knowing that Stockard Channing was 33 and Dinah Manot, who played Marty, was only 18 when the movie was being filmed.(Side note -- if you haven't seen Dinah Manot in Ordinary People, watch it -- you'll be amazed at what a good actress she was).Another interesting cast note the woman who played Jan (brusha brusha brusha) basically was in this movie and that's it except for like three tiny cameo roles in other films. How's that for a film career -- one movie and it's one of the biggest hits of all time! Not bad!When you talk about the movie version of Grease, you have to talk about Travolta. Seeing the bloated, bad actor that he's become, you have to go back and watch this movie to realize that this guy is one of the most talented all-around comedians who ever hit a screen. He can sing, he can dance, he's funny as hell, and he has a style all his own. I dare you to find a young actor today who pops off a screen as much as Travolta did. Unbelievable.The thing I love most about Grease is that it was such an underdog as a project.Helmed by a 31 year old TV director Randal Kleiser (who was George Lucas's roommate at USC, and apparently wrote his own IMDb biography, so maybe he'll read this and correct my mistakes), Paramount didn't expect much out of this movie, and they kind of left the young cast and director to do their thing. There's a fast-and-looseness to the movie, an almost improvisational feel at times, yet the comic timing is always DEAD ON.This is a movie that respects comedy. Sid Caesar, Eve Arden -- these are giants of comedy that were at a career ebb around 1977, and the director shouldn't have been able to get them, but he did, and they make the movie hugely better.But it's all about the young cast.

You've got actors in their late 20s and early 30s playing high schoolers, but somehow it's the best of both worlds -- there's plenty of sophomoric humor, but when Stockard C. sings There are worse things, she gives it a depth Christina Aguilera never could . You've got actors like Jeff Conaway who never really did anything even close to good after this but he's brilliant as Kenickie.

Okay, no problem. Then it drags a voodoo bocur into the scene and I was like, WTF?! This isn't PREDATOR! I checked the box and sure enough, it was. So I unpaused the DVD and started again.This attempt is completely different than the first in the attempt to modernize the Predator story. The characters are less solid, but more likable even though they included Bill Paxton. I don't mind Bill Paxton too much, actually. You know him. He was the whiner\/fake spy in True Lies with Schwarzenegger. He played the whining punk leader that got his hand nearly ripped off in the first Terminator. He was the whining brother to Wyatt Erp in Tombstone. He also played the whiner Hudson in Aliens. And so now they want us to believe him as the Cowboy; a renegade tough guy cop. Okay. I'll buy it. But I want a refund and a Coke, okay? The Predators were done in a slick style in this attempt. I'm not going to say better, but slicker. Their gadgets were better conceived, as were their abilities, and you really felt like you got a bit more movie for the time you spent watching it.The story was solid and the performances were better than average. The first one was slow and suspenseful; a device well used in suspense type productions, as Predator was. This one moved at an even pace and wasn't slow anywhere.I'm too impatient to enjoy that suspense-building device, though. When I go see a monster movie, I want action. I need the character development, but the monsters better be aggressive at some point! But this one gives you both. You get to know the characters and to care about what happens to them, through the exchanges in virtual non-stop action sequences. This movie starts off with action and ends with action.

I am quite amazed at how well done this film is, and how timeless the theme is. I haven't read the book, but I'm considering it, just to see if there are any details that were left out. The story is amazing and exceptionally told. As far as I know, the film is as close to the book as it could possibly be; some call it the most accurate book-to-film conversion ever. The plot is very good, it takes a timeless problem and presents it to us, through the innocent eyes of a naive child. The pace is very good; apart from The Godfather(the first one) and one or two other exceptions, this is the only drama where there was truly not one single moment that I found dull, boring or unimportant. Nothing seemed trivial in the film. The perspective that is forced upon us is that of a young child, naive and innocent. This is a brilliant idea, as the eyes of a child is without a doubt one of the most impressionable things in the world, and the film handles this perfectly. What really makes the film, apart from the brilliant and possibly unique perspective, is the fact that the children are likable, credible and charming. You couldn't help but like them; believe me, normally I really dislike children. I find them annoying, loud and egotistical. But with this film, I couldn't, for one second, muster up any tiny amount of aggression, or even annoyance. They come off as so likable, charming, and, most importantly, *real*. Almost every kid in any Hollywood movie is either a completely ridiculous stereotype\/cliché of a brat, who does nothing but destroy things around him, or the exact opposite, a little angel. Everyone knows that no child is the latter all the time, and even I will admit that there probably doesn't exist too many children who are the first, either. In this film, the children are completely real. They are naive, innocent, they disobey what their father tells them, but ultimately, they obviously love and respect their father, and they never do anything, anything at all, with the intent to hurt or harm someone or something. That is what a child is; innocent. They do what they do because they do not know better. This film provides a perfect view into their world, or, rather, their perspective of it. The acting is excellent. The child actors exceed all expectations. I was amazed at how professional and convincing they were. The other actors all give great performances as well. The cinematography is excellent; once again, it gives a perfect perspective on what your surroundings look like when you're a child. The characters are well-written, credible and well-casted. The dialog was well-written. The script was excellent. A very memorable and beautiful film, should be viewed by almost anyone. I recommend this to anyone who likes dramas, and just about anyone who for one reason or another might enjoy this. Don't be scared off by it being over forty years old, or it being black and white; it's an excellent film, and just about anyone would enjoy it.

I don't know. I guess it is, but the film is also more devoid of Tarantino's style than any of his other work. The non-linear time-line would be the prime example of this; it's only used in a handful of scenes, rather than the one thing that keeps the film going, as is the case with one or two of his other films(Reservoir Dogs, arguably Pulp Fiction). The film has much less violence, sex and drugs than any of his other films as well, which, together with the non-linear time-line, is Tarantino's trademark. However, in some ways, it lifted the film above expectations of the standard Tarantino production; instead of sitting there, waiting for some shocking violence, I actually payed attention to the story, which is more than what I can say for Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction(Kill Bill managed to juggle both things, Tarantino's style and a good, interesting plot perfectly, which is partly why I like it more). The problem with the plot, however, is that it's so damn confusing... if you don't pay perfect attention every single second of the way, you'll miss something. Normally, this would rate high with me, as I like films where it pays off to pay attention... only, this one doesn't. It doesn't pay off to pay attention, because the one reason there is to watch the movie, is to enjoy Tarantino's unique style, which, as I mentioned before, is not as present here as it is in his other movies. The ending is a anti-climax, and a powerful one, since it gives you exactly the ending you expect from the very start of the film, and you realize that you've just spent two and a half hours, watching something that ended exactly the way you knew it would end. Pulp Fiction ended unexpectedly, both in time and situation. Kill Bill had a great twist, at the end of each part\/volume. Even Reservoir Dogs had a better ending than this. The plot is a pretty good, but a little too predictable, and it has almost as bad a pace as Pulp Fiction; the thing that kept me watching was my enjoyment of Tarantino's style and the fact that I wasn't as confused by it as I was by Pulp Fiction.

I was strolling the lanes of Blockbuster today and I fortunately picked up The Red Violin. I have nearly watched this film about 5-6 times before, but each time I always find another movie just getting ready to go and I put this one back as its always my backup. I didn't really know that much about it, but I was curious, so today I finally used my 3rd rental spot on it. Boy am I lucky I chose this.The Red Violin is a story about this violin that was created in 1683 by this relatively famous violin maker. It passes through many hands and is owned by various people of four different languages, five countries, and 300 years. It is practically mythical around the world. But, out of chance, it ends up in an auction house in Montreal where it is what everyone came for. It is the main event. I'll leave out all the various stories, but they are magnificently done and all quite interesting. This magnificent script alternates between the year 1683, the year that the certain owner has the violin (I believe they show ~4 different owners), and the current year (the present) and does it incredibly smoothly. It constantly keeps you on an edge by giving you bit by bit of the auction, until the end when they finish it up. I found this to be a great way of presenting this. Made you really want to see what happens because they kept repeating this.Besides the alternating between time periods, I enjoyed the great characters of various cultures and many different music periods that I encountered as I watched. All these very different people came upon this violin and you can see that while they were so different, they all hailed it as a masterpiece. As a treasure. They all knew that it was special. They all masterfully linked with this violin. Along with this, every character that was introduced was very interesting. You only were with each one for a relatively small amount of time, but that was no matter. You quickly cared for them and their relationship with the violin. You always wanted it to flourish, while still being disappointed time after time.I'm going to try to leave out any specifics of each of the stories, but they are all incredibly interesting. I put a fair amount of backing behind The Red Violin and I definitely recommend it. Four stars, 10\/10, A+ etc.err well I forgot to mention the beautiful score that accompanied this.

I was strolling the lanes of Blockbuster today and I fortunately picked up The Red Violin. I have nearly watched this film about 5-6 times before, but each time I always find another movie just getting ready to go and I put this one back as its always my backup. I didn't really know that much about it, but I was curious, so today I finally used my 3rd rental spot on it. Boy am I lucky I chose this.The Red Violin is a story about this violin that was created in 1683 by this relatively famous violin maker. It passes through many hands and is owned by various people of four different languages, five countries, and 300 years. It is practically mythical around the world. But, out of chance, it ends up in an auction house in Montreal where it is what everyone came for. It is the main event. I'll leave out all the various stories, but they are magnificently done and all quite interesting. This magnificent script alternates between the year 1683, the year that the certain owner has the violin (I believe they show ~4 different owners), and the current year (the present) and does it incredibly smoothly. It constantly keeps you on an edge by giving you bit by bit of the auction, until the end when they finish it up. I found this to be a great way of presenting this. Made you really want to see what happens because they kept repeating this.Besides the alternating between time periods, I enjoyed the great characters of various cultures and many different music periods that I encountered as I watched. All these very different people came upon this violin and you can see that while they were so different, they all hailed it as a masterpiece. As a treasure. They all knew that it was special. They all masterfully linked with this violin. Along with this, every character that was introduced was very interesting. You only were with each one for a relatively small amount of time, but that was no matter. You quickly cared for them and their relationship with the violin. You always wanted it to flourish, while still being disappointed time after time.I'm going to try to leave out any specifics of each of the stories, but they are all incredibly interesting. I put a fair amount of backing behind The Red Violin and I definitely recommend it. Four stars, 10\/10, A+ etc.err well I forgot to mention the beautiful score that accompanied this.

He has this wonderful soft blending of mainly the background colors (usually most notable in the sky), which suggests use of chalk pastels to create this effect. In every film of his that I've seen, he always has great (what I like to call) atmospherics. In this film, you notice it in the blowing of dust\/fog, some of the fire effects with the volcanoes (mainly the falling fire sparks), the falling black ash before the characters reach the mountains that burn, as well as certain water effects.The vocal cast was really well suited to all their roles. There were a few instances where some of the lines were a bit muffled and hard to understand, but for the most part, the cast did really well with their lines, made them sound natural, and child-like, and managed not to be overly cute and obnoxious as some characters made for children's films inherently are.The score by James Horner is a wonderful addition to the film's atmosphere and really does a great job setting the mood. Horner always has a way of infusing his scores with a sense of romanticism that is often lacking in today's film composers, and this film is no exception. He makes really good use of his strings section, especially in this period of his work.To be sure, this film is a masterpiece! All of its excellent qualities are apparent while watching the film, most notably the animation (which is excellent for a late 80s film), the voice cast, the score, the story, and the art direction.

Except for her half-hooded eyes there isn't anything special about any of her features. It's just that when you put them all together they add up to a Gestalt that is more than equal to the sum of its parts. Maybe too it has something to do with her figure, which has been on abundant display for thirty years and hasn't changed a millimeter in any of its dimensions.I can't speak for Dennis Quaid's handsomeness but he's a fine actor, even with, or maybe cause of, that slight lisp. He almost always brings something extra to his roles whether they deserve it or not. (He was an outstanding Jerry Lee Lewis.) The director, Peter Yates, gives him a bare chested scene here but doesn't take advantage of the opportunity to have Quaid flex his muscles or anything. His torso doesn't even have a sun tan. Thank you, Mr. Yates. Your concept of masculinity doesn't include self display. Quaid is a lobbyist who cares about his looks only to the extent that they can help him pull off his con jobs. He's boyish and charming at the beginning, trying to manipulate everyone, but drops that insouciance aptly as the drama develops.There's a scene that demonstrates Quaid's range as a performer rather well. He's a suit, of course, and when he enters the abandoned Railway Express Station in Washington where all these unwashed dangerous-looking homeless people live, he actually seems scared. Good for him. He really doesn't have to be. The homeless are pretty harmless, most of them mentally ill, but it's the kind of reaction a person might have who wears gold-plated cufflinks and is unfamiliar with the milieu and its inhabitants.The plot is easy to follow but hard to believe. There's an awful lot of conventional action in it. Quaid dashes in unexpectedly to save Cher's hide twice. Not that Cher's hide isn't worth saving but we've seen this a hundred times. We've also seen a woman trapped in an empty building followed by a slasher, running up and down stairs, stabbing frantically at an elevator button so the doors will close before the razor is wielded. Ho hum. And suspicion is thrown on a homeless psychotic named Michael. There is a long search for this Michael. He's finally found with his throat cut and the thread is dropped from the story without explanation. Who killed Michael? And why? Nobody cares. And I don't know why it was necessary to make it clear that the stern, corrupt, and finally murderous judge was a Republican. So what? Someone should give Peter Yates a crack at a truly gutsy narrative again, like Bullet. Not that the director is a slouch. He has a wordless and very tense scene in a law library that Hitchcock himself would have preened over. But -- that aside -- I kept wondering what a lawyer might make out of all this. Cher, the defense attorney for a Liam Neeson who has very little to do and literally nothing to say, suffering from hearing loss and elective mutism. When asked on the stand whether he murdered a woman, he hiccups and gulps, N-no. It could have been worse. He might have thrown away his crutches and screamed, Look, Mein Fuhrer -- I can VALK! Paul Mahoney as the judge is very good too. He was superb as the tragic\/comic William Faulkner in the Coen brothers' Barton Fink. But again it's hard to imagine a trial like this actually taking place. Cher not only is in contact with a juror. She's really in CONTACT with him.

At least most of his work, such as Life Is Sweet, does have it's enjoyable and sometimes funny moments. Naked does not even have have that to recommend it. Far from being his masterpiece, it's his worst, a boring exercise in misery and misogyny.It is the film's sexual politics which are most reprehensible. The 'hero', Johnny, likes to have sex with women in a way which blurs the line between rape and rough consensual sex, yet we are never given any indication as to why. When the film offers another rapist who is an out-and-out villain, are we supposed to feel that Johnny is not that bad after all.

Some of the criticism I've read have always seemed just a tad off base, particularly the ones that say that Streep never seems to get a handle on her character--she just acts kind of comically frazzled. Well I think that's the point, isn't it? Streep as Fisher doesn't know what she wants or who she is, and while trying to discover these things, she must battle her drug dependence, rebuild her career against all odds and hope, in addition to trying to reconcile her relationship with her outlandishly domineering mother, who just happens to be a legendary star with issues of her own. In this scenario, frazzled would seem to be the way to go.In any case, those who have commented positively on the movie have mostly mentioned the great performances (as well as Carrie Fisher's wonderful screenplay), and rightly so since this is one the most smartly acted (and well-written) movies you will ever see. But it seems strange that the outstanding direction of Mike Nichols is rarely mentioned. I remember one Oscar ceremony when a producer whose movie had just won Best Picture, and, indeed, swept all the major awards--except Best Director--said apparently the Academy thinks that the actors directed themselves. It would seem that many of the viewers of Postcards From The Edge think the same thing. In my opinion, Nichols doesn't get enough credit for the seamless way this movie moves or for the crispness of the comic timing. At every turn, he brings out the best in his actors, most especially in the dynamic scenes involving Streep and McLaine. I also love the way he shows, through shifting background effects, how movie illusions are created, which he further uses to illustrate how we often hide our true motivations. (The great example of this is in the scene on the lot with Streep and Dennis Quaid where he was trying to convince her he has always been sincere in his feelings for her--and maybe they should even marry. Then suddenly the background, a house and white picket fence cardboard front, is moved away by a production crew.)This is a wonderfully entertaining movie, brilliantly acted and written and, yes, superbly directed.

Unfortunately, the film itself didn't seem to know this, and kept jumping between genres. I don't know who is to blame, the director, the scriptwriter, or someone else, but someone obviously didn't realize the importance of picking one(or two, if you can't pick just one) genre and sticked to that. Instead, what we have is a movie that is primarily a thriller, but has parts of action, horror, and a few sub-genres... there was even a scene of martial arts action; who in their right mind puts martial arts in a thriller? Apart from the problem of not settling on one genre, the film is pretty good. The mystery was quite good, though I'm not sure I entirely understood it. The thriller portions of the film were well-done, and the film has good atmosphere at a few points. The film has some creepy, disturbing and downright nasty scenes involving corpses and body parts. The cinematography was pretty good, but nothing too memorable. One mistake the filmmakers made was making just about every member of the French police force seem like a retard; obviously done for comic relief, but done wrong and pushed too far. In the end, it's pathetic, and actually annoying to watch, rather than entertaining. If they wanted comic relief, they should have implemented it through dialog. Fortunately, though, there aren't too many scenes of these failed attempts at comedy, so it's easily forgiven. The humor that there was, the parts of it that work, were more often than not good, and I liked the relationship between the two main characters, which made for much better, and more entertaining, comic relief. The last problem the film has, is what I like to call the Hollywood Syndrome; the last half hour or so being painfully predictable, and the very end being so awfully happy ending-like that it almost takes the enjoyment out of the pretty good film you've just watched. However, all in all, if you can ignore the shortcomings of the film, it actually makes for a good watch, if you can take the violence and you like a good mystery. A final note; as the film is French, not English(or American, for that matter) the dialog is all in French. My French being crappy, pardon my French(sorry, bad pun), I saw this with subtitles(not that I had much choice, as I saw it on TV, but anyway), so if you don't understand French, you might wanna make sure that the version you're seeing is subtitled(I've heard that there is an English-dubbed version, and that it's awful), in order for you to actually follow what's going on in the film. OK, one final note(yeah, I lied before. Sue me); while watching this, I realized that Jean Reno actually sounds cooler when speaking French than when speaking English. I recommend this to anyone who can stand the violence(which is somewhat considerable and at times sadistic and gruesome), and who enjoys a good thriller-mystery. An all-round good mystery-thriller, with good acting and good production values. 7\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"4 September 2004","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  When I sat down to watch this movie, I knew it was gonna be a thriller.

The former is most likely the more probable, unfortunately, thus the rating of 5.7 at the time I'm writing this review, 4, September, 2004. Rimbaud was a poet who came to fame early on. Born in 1854, Jean-Nicolas-Arthur Rimbaud was one of four other siblings, a brother and three sisters, however, two of the three sisters passed. By fourteen, he was winning nearly every academic competition he entered and by fifteen, had his first poem published in a literary review (Mason, 2003). The police took interest in him as he was a trouble maker.Some of his more famous writings, A Season in Hell, A Drunken Boat, and First Night, are what he accomplished before giving up on writing at an equally young age, eighteen! Because he was so young, and maintained such excellence, he's been likened to similar prodigies such as Mozart, and Picasso. His is a work of certain genius which we can peer into - via this short dramatic biography - if we allow ourselves to pay close enough attention. I recommend this movie to any scholar, anyone interested in poetry\/writing, anyone interested in prodigies, artists (or their madd, sometimes megalomania temperament), or depressives. Overall, it was good, it sparked remembrances of Robin Williams in Dead Poet's Society (1989), Gwyneth Paltrow in Sylvia (2003), and Sean Connery in Finding Forrester (2000). All are great writing flicks about love, loss, overcoming the human condition, or being ruined by it.
