[{"date":"6 July 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Now to be honest it took me a few years to find this movie to be any good. Strangely I did not like this movie very much when I first saw it because it was quite different than the comics and television shows. After getting a little older and watching it a few more times it grew on me. I now recognize this movie as a classic superhero film that helped pave the way for other comic book movies.The X-Men movie does away with the colorful costumes of the comics in favor of all black suits. For what this X-Men film was trying to do I actually think changing the costumes was the right way to go. The X-Men film was covering some pretty serious themes and the colorful costumes would have taken away from the seriousness. X-Men has just the right tone, seriousness, and believability to work. The plot focuses on the war between mutants and regular humans with Professor Xavier trying to make peace and Magneto trying to fight against them. The acting is a huge part of why this movie works. Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier and Ian Mckellen as Magneto was the best casting choices that could have been made. Both men brought so much to their characters. Hugh Jackmon as Wolverine was also probably the best casting choice that could have been made. Hugh was fantastic as Wolverine! The downfall of this film is the lack of screen time for some of the characters such as Cyclops and Jean Grey. They try to make us care about Wolverine being in love with Jean Grey but we don't know her enough to really care. Cyclops is the most important X-Men in the comics and he barely has anything to do in the movie. Anytime he is on screen there doesn't even seem to be a purpose other than he's there because he was in the comics. Another downfall is that the movie lacks that epicness that it could have had. Although it's a cool movie and it entertains, the movie does leave you kind of disappointed. It ends with a generic battle against the bad guys and nothing about the mutant rights is ever resolved. X-Men is very important to the superhero and comic book movie genre. Overall X-Men is certainly missing that certain something that could have made it great, but it's still a good movie. And it is a great set up for X2.

He can rarely do wrong with the exception of most the 2000's (small joke.) Striking Distance was solidly into his leading man career that made him an action superstar. Striking Distance didn't appear to have the enormous budget of like minded Willis vehicles (30 million vs 70 million for Die Hard 2, 3 years earlier) but that is part of its charm. Striking Distance is part mystery, part thriller, a dash of action, and some great character depth even if the lead character is a little bit predictable as a washed up, alcoholic, traumatically scarred former cop. Willis plays the broody alcoholic like nobodies business. The mystery is solid, and the action scenes are well done. It even features one of the best and most underplayed car\/boat chase scenes in action film history...or at least the nineties. A terrific supporting cast of whose who nineties character actors help move the story along and support Willis throughout. Sometimes movie watchers like mystery, dislike action, or some variation of such but Striking Distance gives a little of all of the major genres to make it the perfect film for just pure entertainment.Bruce Willis is the iconic macho man. I could watch him do just about anything. As the aforementioned brooding former cop spending his days as barely more than a security guard on the waters. The character is not revolutionary and can be considered predictable but Willis makes Tom Hardy the best he can possibly be and that's a bad ass good guy. Remember Sarah Jessica Parker before she was Sex and The City's Carrie Bradshaw? Me neither but she is cute and vivacious as fellow boat cop Jo Christman. The character doesn't truly fit into the dreary, dark and often foreboding setting but somehow Parker impressively makes it work. Equally impressive is the fact that Parker and Willis do have decent chemistry and their romance somehow works although it feels forced into the story at times. The whose who supporting cast I mentioned include talented character actors, and TV actors. The most noteworthy are Dennis Farina, Tom Sizemore, Brion James, Robert Pastorelli (really terrific), and John Mahoney (small role but really terrific as Willis' decorated cop father.) Director Rowdy Herrington isn't big in Hollywood but he can be attributed to helming the 80's classic Roadhouse and now Striking Distance. Given his ability to direct two big leading men and let them be what the audiences love should account for something. I have a feeling though Herrington's directing ability ends there. Given something without a leading man probably wouldn't account for much although I haven't seen any of his other work. Striking Distance is just plainly entertaining. It isn't mind blowing and it isn't likely to be most peoples favorite film but it is one that I frequently go back to on a lazy Sunday afternoon for some simple, well made entertainment. It also isn't necessarily considering one of Willis' big films by any means but at the same time is gem amongst his work from the nineties.

Stanley Kubrick shows the bare bones of it, without romanticizing, and without making heroes out of anyone. There are two main emotional turning points, one at the end of boot camp, and one near the end of the movie, and both are about the madness of war and about death. And both are pulled out of the mainstream thread of the story with a jolt. It's sensationalism, really, but made with Kubrick rigor. A balance to all the horror is the humor, not as insane as, say Dr. Strangelove, but with a similar dry wit. The first forty minutes of the film are justly famous for their almost campy but still believable scenes of the sergeant training young Marines. (And this sarge is a real Vietnam vet who did this kind of training.)Compare this movie to Platoon and you'll see a much more restrained movie, and without the jungle warfare we usually associate with Vietnam. Platoon makes people out to be larger than life, and Kubrick intends more to say, hey, this is the real deal, whatever cinematic tricks are showing.

It includes a score by composer Miklós Rózsa and features stop-motion effects from Ray Harryhausen (this one in Dynarama). It's the second of three Sinbad films that Harryhausen made for Columbia, the others being The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958) and Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger (1977). The plot sees legendary sailor Sinbad come into possession of a tablet dropped onto his ship by a mysterious flying creature. The tablet is one part of a map which greatly intrigues Sinbad so he wears it as an amulet. However, the tablet was bound for evil magician Koura (Baker) who now wants it back as it will lead to The Fountain Of Destiny. Can Sinbad, aided by the Grand Vizier Of Marabia (Wilmer), fend off Koura before he gets the rewards from the fountain to use for his evil ways?A smooth adventure piece that's low on plotting but high on magical mystery fervour. More known for directing horror films, Hessler does an admirable job in not letting the thin story bog the movie down. Sometimes with Harryhausen led movies the stop-motion creations end up being the sole reason for watching the film. And while, as always, they are the best thing in this movie, they give the film an Arabian Nights feel to the piece, managing to charm and engage enough to round it out as a full film viewing experience. Yes the cast are sub-standard B listers, with John Law and Munro featuring, one thinks, for looks (cool beard and turban look) and bosom (whoosh!) respectively. While Tom Baker's pantomime villain act could never become tiring; such is the fun he and the audience are having with it. But this be a good old yarn that's spun well in conjunction with Harryhausen's effects. Here we are treated to a vengeful ships Figurehead, a Centaur, a winged Griffin, a tiny Gargoyle and best of the bunch-the goddess Kali, a six armed statue that is brought to life by Koura. The latter giving a moment to rival that of Talos' awakening in Jason & The Argonauts. Look out for Robert Shaw who features uncredited as the Oracle Of All Knowledge. Rózsa adds the aural joy with mystical Arabian flavours, and Ted Moore's cinematography brings the gorgeous colours and costumes to life.Good wholesome family entertainment. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 July 2010","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The Golden Voyage of Sinbad is directed by Gordon Hessler and stars John Phillip Law (Sinbad), Tom Baker, Caroline Munro, Douglas Wilmer, Takis Emmanuel & Martin Shaw.
