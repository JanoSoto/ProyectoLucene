What Oliver Stone sees, we see, what Oliver Stone feels, we can at least feel most of it.  JFK is one of the best films ever made and a lot of that has to be attributed to his work\/vision.  It is a unique film and not just because of what it stands for but because how it was made.  There were certain scenes in that film where you couldn't tell what was 35 or 16mm filmstock and what was archived footage.  That authenticity, that care and devotion into that film made it ( in my opinion ) one of the 3 best films ever made ( Jaws and American Beauty sandwiching it on my list of best films ever).  While Any Given Sunday is not one of the best films ever made it is certainly one of the best that has come out this year.  Oliver Stone has done to professional football ( and perhaps all major North American sports ) what he did to politics and the government in JFK and Platoon.  He has dissected it and exposed it for what it really is.  As football fans, all we see is the gloss, the glamour, the spotlights, the charity devoted athletes, the replays, the larger than life personalities and great athleticism.  What we don't see, even though we know about it in dark corners is what Stone has shown us here, in this excellent film.I read a few articles about this film and one of them said that Stone spent five years researching this movie to get it right and be true to what he is saying.  And if you look at what and who is involved here and what is not involved here, then you have to believe that what he is saying has some merit to it.You have the participation of some of the games past greats like L.T. and Jim Brown and some of the games future greats like Ricky Williams that participated in the filming of the movie and they swear by what Stone has filmed.  They concur with the fact that corruption, drug abuse, womanizing, commercialism, greed and selfishness is just a euphanism for what football is all about.  Then you also have the non participation and non co-operation of the NFL when it came to using football names and even their logo.  To me that says that they don't want to be associated with this film because it is slanderous to what they want you to believe.  But look closely and listen even closer and everything that you see in here may be closer to the truth than what you thought.What Any Given Sunday has is a great cast and one hell of a lead.  Al Pacino could read the phonebook and make it interesting somehow.  His portrayal of Tony D'Amato is so compelling and so honest that I really felt as though I knew this man.  There are so many tiny moments of grace for him in this role but the best that I have seen him in quite sometime was when he gave one particular speech to his team just before their potential last game of the season.  He was trying to preach that you have to win as a team and lose as a team.  He was preaching team unity and telling everyone that it is time to get rid of individualism that exists in the locker room.  It is a speech that starts out humbly enough but steamrolls into what Oscars are made of. I wanted to suit up and play for him after that speech.  I suspect that Al Pacino will get an Oscar nomination for his role in The Insider but this is the film that he deserves it for.  I still don't think there is a better performance this year than Kevin Spacey in American Beauty but this is definitely a distant second.  In this film he is Tony D'Amato.The rest of the cast is also quite impressive and I have to say that casting Cameron Diaz in the second biggest role in the film was risky. But she shows that she is more than just a pretty face in Hollywood.  There were many scenes where she bantered with Pacino for pages and pages of script and she comes across beautifully.  Jamie Foxx is also excellent in the film. There is one small role that I wanted to mention because even though Lauren Holly has a brief appearance as Dennis Quaid's wife, she steals many scenes that she is in.  There is one particular scene where she tells Cap ( Quaid ) that he is not ready to retire, that he is the bleepin quarterback for the Miami Sharks and that she won't listen to this crap from him right now.  I seriously wanted to leap through the screen and slap her and the rest of the theater felt the same way.  Her character is just as selfish as any of the others in the film and she should be recognized for doing it so well.The one thing that is glaringly wrong with the film is some of the smashmouth editting.  There are times when the cuts are so fast and furious that you have a hard time seeing what is going on during the games.  This would have been better if the game was shown with more clarity and precision.  The MTV generation doesn't have to dictate editting techniques in an Oliver Stone film.  That is the only complaint that I have with the film but unfortunately it is a big one and it does detract from the overall aesthetic of it.  When the story is told and we are allowed to get involved with it completely then it is a great film.  However when it becomes a showcase for quick cuts to rock and roll music and the occasional gangsta rap, it becomes annoying.  I really wish the editting wasn't so dominant because the film would have been so much better.Any Given Sunday is a great film and it is one that should be seen by everyone that has a mild interest in sports.  There is much to be learned from it and most importantly it is one hell of an entertaining film.8 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 December 1999","score":"","review":"  Love or hate Oliver Stone for his beliefs and the way he films them ( Platoon, Wall Street, Born on the 4th of July, JFK, Nixon) you have to say one thing about the man; he is a brilliant artist\/director.

Arthur Adamson is the man they want.  He is a gem dealer by day and a nasty jewel thief by night.

Family Plot is interesting to watch, mainly because of the historical significance of it, but aside from its association it really is nothing more than a thinly layered television movie.  Some of the Hitchcockian elements are there.  Of course we get his own cameo (an important ingredient to all of his films) and of course we get a few neat scenes (the cut away  at the beginning from Blanche and George in the cab to Karen Black, who they almost hit at a crosswalk was great). On the other hand, the characters are two dimensional.  We don't really know why Arthur killed his parents, and frankly we don't care.  Blanche is an over the top fake as a spiritualist, and the scene that showcases her work is comedically boring.  Not only are the characters lifeless, but they don't fit in with the mood of the film.

","genre":"Comedy, Thriller"},{"date":"26 December 1999","score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":"  Hitchcock's film Family Plot is significant only because it was his last effort, and because it starred a cast of players that today begs the question Where are they now?Family Plot stars Barbara Harris as a fake spiritualist named Blanche who is asked to find a missing person.  She and her boyfriend George (Bruce Dern) are enticed into taking on the task only because of the reward involved.  Little do they know, they are on to something dangerous. Arthur Adamson is the man they want.  He is a gem dealer by day and a nasty jewel thief by night.  Teamed up with his accomplice, Fran, played Miss Karen Black (still donning the big blonde wig she wore in Nashville) they kidnap millionaires and dignitaries in an effort to get their precious gem stones.  Arthur Adamson, unbeknownst to Fran, George and Blanche, has a shady past.  Apparently Arthur killed his parents and faked his own death. Family Plot is interesting to watch, mainly because of the historical significance of it, but aside from its association it really is nothing more than a thinly layered television movie.  Some of the Hitchcockian elements are there.  Of course we get his own cameo (an important ingredient to all of his films) and of course we get a few neat scenes (the cut away  at the beginning from Blanche and George in the cab to Karen Black, who they almost hit at a crosswalk was great). On the other hand, the characters are two dimensional.  We don't really know why Arthur killed his parents, and frankly we don't care.  Blanche is an over the top fake as a spiritualist, and the scene that showcases her work is comedically boring.  Not only are the characters lifeless, but they don't fit in with the mood of the film.  I gather that this was to be a black comedy, but the characters are more suited to the slapstick genre, only you get the feeling they are confused as to whether they should be toning it down or camping it up!  It seems evident that Hickcock's film making and 1970's sensibility simply do not mix well.And speaking of 'Black' comedy, Miss Karen gets top billing for a film that she is not the star of.  Bruce Dern and Barbara Harris get much more screen time than she does and their characters are far more relevant to the plot.  Karen's Fran is nothing more than a moll for William Devane's Arthur.  You can clearly see who had the best agent back in 1976!Luckily Family Plot is not too terrible a film that it would tarnish the image of a great director.

I believe that 'Ripley' should give Law the fame and recognition he deserves(even though i am not looking forward to the media saturation that will undoubtedly follow w\/ every entertainment outlet acting as though they just discovered him), dispel the myth that Gwyneth is anything but a moderately talented, Hollywood legacy, trust-fund baby (even though it won't), and convince Matt Damon to rid himself of that hulking little man frame he is so fond of since this movie is the first time i have ever found him mildly attractive.Now that i have gotten all of the superficial stuff out of the way, i will discuss the film.  i must admit that after i fell in love w\/ Jude all over again in Cronenberg's 'eXistEnz', i immediately went out and read the Highsmith book and all of the other 4 books in the Ripley series.  Anyone who has also read the series knows that this film varies wildly from the book, but that doesn't mean it is without its merits.  Jude and Matt give very good performances, the cinematography is excellent and i think the subject matter is a bold choice for a holiday film.The problems that i had with it were its overlength (remember when movies were 90 mins long) and the unnecessary addition of certain plots and characters.  Meridith Logue and Peter Smith Kingsley worked as characters in the film but i felt that they took away more than they added.  Because of the time spent on those and the Silvana plot, we got less of a feeling of the claustrophobia of Ripley's situation after 'the deed' was done.  A lot more time should have been spent focusing on the deft way that Tom had to cover his tracks in order to keep from getting caught.  Also, the film all but eliminated the way that Tom actually did become Dickie in Rome.  He didn't cower and sulk all day; he went to parties and introduced himself as Dickie and was quite successful at it.The whole point of Ripley is his amorality.  He was a sociopath and a good one.  > i think that Damon did a good job of playing Ripley as sullen and sad, but i think that it would have been more compelling if Ripley had enjoyed himself just a little bit more.In closing, Jude Law should win the Golden Globe if only for his exquisite beauty and for his ability to exude such an androgynously liquid sexuality. Very few actors have that ability and combined with his considerable acting talent, he should be recognized as the brilliant star that he is.

Minghella weaves a complicated plot reminiscent of Hichcock, with an Italian backdrop that appears to have been filmed in glorious technicolor.Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) is wash room attendant in New York City who gets lucky one day when he is asked to pose as a high society charmer at a swank Park Avenue party.  The event leads to a chance meeting with industrialist, Herbert Greenleaf.  When Ripley lies about going to Princeton with Greenleaf's son, Ripley is paid to jet off to Europe to persuade the son to come back home.  Ripley does his homework for this trip.  He studies jazz music because he knows that this is Dickie's passion.Dickie Greenleaf, as it turns out, is a beautiful, egotistical, womanizing blue blood, who has fled to Europe (at a time when it was fashionable to do so) and has refused all contact with his father, except for the monthly allowance that keeps him going.Dickie keeps Marge, a beautiful debutante, by his side, except for when his is fraternizing with the local women in Italy.Ripley worms his way into their lives, enchanting the pants off of them and soon becomes a part of their 'family'.  A series of lies and misdeeds complicates Ripley's plans.  It all starts when he meets Merideth (Cate Blanchett) and lets her believe that he is Dickie Greenleaf. It becomes more twisted as Dickie and Marge exhibit their vulnerable sides.We soon learn that Ripley's fixation on Dickie is more than just an opportunity to fit in with the rich and powerful.  Ripley is a homosexual and is mad about Dickie.  We learn that this is not just an opportunistic venture, but now it is a dangerous fixation.And from here the plot begins to unravel.The Talented Mr. Ripley is not just another thriller about love gone wrong. In fact, this film doesn't offer any cheap thrills.  There are moments in the picture when it seemed likely that the standard Fatal Attraction-like moment could occur, but they never do.  Instead, Minghella relies on the twisted lies weaved by Ripley, and the intelligence of the other characters, to keep the audience interested and in suspense.Matt Damon delivers a great performance, perhaps his best yet.  Of course he uses that signature smirk to carry him through much of the film, but when he isn't smiling we see a determined young man, who we know we should be weary of, but yet we are compelled to feel sorry for.Gwyneth Paltrow as Marge is horribly sweet.  She is never as naive as she lets on.The entire cast is actually very good.  This new 'brat pack' delivers. Jude Law is perfect as Dickie.  While he elicits no sympathy from the audience, we can see why Ripley and so many others are smitten.  Cate Blanchett is wonderful as the bored debutante looking for love in all the wrong places. And Phillip Seymour Hoffman once again proves himself to be the best actor to emerge out the past few years, taking on a character that is too wicked to be liked, yet too in touch to be dismissed.Minghella presents a film that is a worthy follow up to his epic, The English Patient.  Beautiful panoramic views of 1950's Italy serve as the backdrop to a dangerous story about class, deceit and betrayal.
