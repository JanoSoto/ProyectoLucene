Pointless is one thing, I can handle pointless, but the senseless violence and the lack of morality involved is beyond reason; it's insane. Other than a couple moments, the 'feel' and 'movement' of the story was all off for me. This combination of elements brings me to the conclusion that whoever had in in their right (or not so right) mind to make it must have been tripping on acid or something, like they've taken Bonnie and Clyde out of the 20s and put them into the 90s, removed all form of ryhme or reason, then made them national celebrities.And the whole past segments, with the girl's parents, those were some of the most annoying, gut-wrenching moments I've ever experienced in a film, and they made the film that much worse for being there.Now, I know there'll probably be arguments on it as a 'message' against the media, against this or that, blah blah blah, but, the point is, it's not that it rubbed me the wrong way, it's that it failed to really rub me at all, and thus in the end became a shameless exhibition of killing... the only message I can gather from this, is that it is about as pointless as the world is, which in my mind still needs that extra something to become at least a decent movie..Don't get me wrong; violence in movies I don't mind, but there are certain things that just don't mix well, movies like this literally promote violent action. It basically says 'Go around and kill people, you'll be a celebrity!'. I hate to say it, but movies like this give the rest a bad name. Basketball diaries, that had a scene where he's shooting his classmates, but it was a fantasy, it didn't say it was alright to go and kill your classmates. There's a difference between showing what is controversial, and promoting it.Actually the film is SUPPOSED to be a satire, but it ends up being a mockery of itself, much like Stone's attempt at exposing football. (Any Given Sunday.) Which turned out to be a celebration of football (see the ending), rather than an indictment of the sport and all it's negative aspects (which is where the film started).But back to NBK. Stone had a worthwile point to make in NBK, he just shoved it down our throats so hard, we spit it back up at him.Yes, the media is bad. Yes, they can create news as much as cover it. Yes, the media can create heroes out of seemingly psychopathic people. But when you don't show us the pain and anguish these deaths cause, and don't give us a human element to hang our hats on, you get a film that does,(unintentional as it might be), glorify violence. -thoughts by Heizer, whom I had a conversation with a long while ago about it.Without that human element, the sense that someone out there is truly suffering because of these assholes that thought it was cool to start shooting at anything that moves, the movie thus defeats its purpose, and is just another overdone B movie with no real purpose other than to say 'Hey, I can kill a lot of people in 2 hours, too!'.. plus, I didn't want to comment on it, but some of the acting was just horrible... especially the father, and our two 'heroes' as it were, definitely not their good work.Satire is one thing, Bamboozeled was satire, but it reflected the pain and consequences for these actions that took place. NBK doesn't really go beyond the craze of its own subject matter. Sure, they got caught, beat up, whatever, but it was just in so much poor taste how things kept moving right along.And stylized filming, when used well can enhance the effect of a good film, but in most parts it became an unwanted distraction to an otherwise bad film. Requiem for a Dream is a good example of how a good film is enhanced so much by effective stylizing.Now, I can't believe they made Tommy Lee Jones so repulsive. I think Oliver Stone purposely wanted bad acting, repulsive characters, etc. and that boggles the mind. Why would someone want elements in a film to make it unlasting, a freakshow on display that belittles the minds of those watching it? I hear people who have praised this film, enough so that it got me to finally pick it up at blockbuster and give it a watch. Contempable, that was, sorry to say. I'm just trying to figure out how this film can be so damn likable? I certainly can't see it.Ok, end rant here. Hopefully, someone will see this and realize they shouldn't bother.

I even watched it again a year or so later on cable and still didn't like it. A few months ago I was talking to a couple of guys who loved the movie and they were talking about all this subtle, symbolic stuff that was in the movie that supposedly made it so creepy. I started to think that maybe I'd been missing something all along. One guy described the blood-filled elevator scene as representing fear of menstruation. Since I was 16 or 17 when I first saw the film I thought that maybe some of this symbolism had gone right over my head. So I go out a couple months ago and rent the movie and watch it again for the first time in over 20 years and all I could think afterwards was that those guys were talking out of their a**es. Fear of menstruation? Huh? The first person in the movie to have this vision of the blood-filled elevator was the kid, Danny. How old was he? Five? Six? Why would a 5 or 6 year old BOY have a fear of menstruation. Wendy (Shelly Duval) sees the same bloody scene later in the film but I guess her son is more afraid of menstruation than she is since he had the vision first. These guys also tried to tell me that the movie had something to do with American Indians. An earlier post on this site says the same thing and suggests that we research it on the internet. This movie was released in 1980, way before the internet as we know it existed. Were we supposed to sit around waiting for the internet to be invented and for someone to put up a The Shining site so that this movie would finally reveal its scary treasures? If I have to research the movie on the internet for it to become scary then the movie doesn't work. As for the Indian thing, one of the guys observed that as the movie progressed Wendy started wearing her hair like an Indian (whatever that means) and that in one scene she was wearing moccasins. OOOhhh SCARY!!! Didn't this story take place out West? Don't people out there who AREN'T in symbol laden horror movies wear all kinds of Indian and Indian inspired clothing and jewelry? What the hell?! So what. Finally, I thought that Shelly Duval was horribly miscast and Jack Nicholson was creepy right from the beginning of the movie so that I never got the sense that he was gradually going insane once he arrived at the hotel. For a time I thought that the movie was being intentionally ambiguous about whether the hotel was having a malevolent effect on Jack or whether his personal demons were getting the better of him. The film might have been better if it had maintained this ambiguity but instead it scuttled it altogether as soon as we see that Wendy is seeing some of the same apparitions that her son and Jack saw. So it's not all just in Jack's head. And of course there was the fact that the previous caretaker had gone nuts and murdered his family. I'm not one of those people who was disappointed that the movie wasn't faithful to the book. I didn't like the book either. If only someone could go back in time and stop Stephen King from writing that novel we could have been spared both his dreck and Kubrick's.

Although it is unfair to compare the two films as they are both trying to raise different points about generation x, I found that this tale wasn't as effect as the former. Although Kids wasn't a particularly comfortable film to watch, which I understand was the point, it did leave a lasting impression and the ending of that film particularly disturbed me. I admit that in this film there were disturbing scenes and one thing that Larry Clark does very well is never put a Hollywood polish on his movies, what you see is what you get, but I didn't really see a point to the scenes.Perhaps, I am, missing the point that the violence and sex was meaningless and that's what makes it so provocative. However, if you don't give me something that is going to grip me, to immediately grab my attention, then perhaps I will remain in ignorance about what the film is trying to say.Again not to make comparison to Kids, but I couldn't relate to any of the characters in this film, like I could the former. Although I have never led a promiscuous lifestyle, I can relate to a hormone fuelled existence. However, although I am middle class and from suburbia,I can not imagine being so casual about the things that they do throughout the film.Perhaps had the performances been a little more realistic, I may have got the film a little better. The three main female leads I thought did a good job, two of the few memorable moments in the film for me came from them. One when the girl in rehab discusses her Grandfather and when Ali is cradling her naked baby.However the male performances left me a little cold. I am a big fan of Brad Renfro as a rule but in this his performance was inconsistent and dull. In kids the characters were obnoxious but at least they were compelling to watch. The supposed Bully wasn't convincing as this person of terror and the guy from Dawson's creek just grated on me. Leo Fitzpatrick on the other hand was a entertaining as ever, although I was a little disturbed at first by him gone through puberty.Overall I thought that, although there were a few good performances, it wasn't a remarkable film. Had they had instead of trying to fit so much sex and close ups on Rachel Milner's nipples (who walks around naked that much) and actually built up a more compelling picture of how terrible this person was, I may have been more convinced.

Although it is unfair to compare the two films as they are both trying to raise different points about generation x, I found that this tale wasn't as effect as the former. Although Kids wasn't a particularly comfortable film to watch, which I understand was the point, it did leave a lasting impression and the ending of that film particularly disturbed me. I admit that in this film there were disturbing scenes and one thing that Larry Clark does very well is never put a Hollywood polish on his movies, what you see is what you get, but I didn't really see a point to the scenes.Perhaps, I am, missing the point that the violence and sex was meaningless and that's what makes it so provocative. However, if you don't give me something that is going to grip me, to immediately grab my attention, then perhaps I will remain in ignorance about what the film is trying to say.Again not to make comparison to Kids, but I couldn't relate to any of the characters in this film, like I could the former. Although I have never led a promiscuous lifestyle, I can relate to a hormone fuelled existence. However, although I am middle class and from suburbia,I can not imagine being so casual about the things that they do throughout the film.Perhaps had the performances been a little more realistic, I may have got the film a little better. The three main female leads I thought did a good job, two of the few memorable moments in the film for me came from them. One when the girl in rehab discusses her Grandfather and when Ali is cradling her naked baby.However the male performances left me a little cold.

A lot of people don't understand why Dorothy was wearing that mask and chasing Kate at the end if she wasn't the killer. From what I gathered it was because she was the killer. They caught her right handed at the end. The reason a lot of you are getting confused is becasue of the last scene when Angel's nose was bleeding.I think they just showed his nose bleeding to show the viewers that he was that little nerdy kid. What I mean is, I think he was that nerdy kid that they all picked on, but that doesn't mean he was the killer. What they were showing I think was he came back for Kate cause she was always nice to him, his nose bleeds whenever he gets nervous the same as when he was a kid. Dorothy was the killer, they just didin't show her nose bleeding ever so we wouldn't guess it was her, but it was her really under the mask with the nose bleeds.

A year later, Cross of Iron was a released. Sam Peckinpah's venture into the boots of the German soldier is a much more honest, downbeat and brutal tale. While The Eagle has Landed is a story of pure heroism, Cross of Iron is a depressing take on the horrors of war. This film proves that infantry soldiers are usually just men fighting for survival, no matter what uniform they wear.In the spring of 1943, the German Army is on the retreat in Russia. They're low on supplies, food and ammunition; the Reds are advancing in overwhelming numbers. Enter Prussian aristocrat Captain Stransky (Maximilian Schell) an ambitious and inexperienced officer who firmly believes in German patriotism and spirit. His superiors, Colonel Brandt (James Mason) and Captain Kiesel (David Warner) dismiss him as arrogant and disillusioned; gradually, the true source of his ignorance is revealed to be madness. In contrast is Sergeant Steiner (James Coburn), the hero of the piece. Steiner will prove that Stransky is an incompetent coward, and though Stransky comes to realize this, he refuses to admit it. The film follows a series of arguments and conversations regarding class difference, as the two men bait each other and grow to hate each other.The conflict between Steiner and Stransky is a microcosm of the war around them. Every one of their encounters is either borne out of or cut off by vicious combat of some sort. How important is Stransky's madness within the greater madness of a World War? From the moment Stransky appears, he is the villain. He's freshly shaved and clad in a clean uniform, ordering dirty infantrymen to push his luggage-laden motorcycle out of a mud hole. His first meeting with Brandt and Kiesel defines his character he jumps when artillery shells burst outside a cramped bunker, yet meticulously combs his gel-covered hair as he defies Brandt's opinion that the war has already been lost. We've seen five minutes of film, and we've already chalked Stransky up as an arrogant idiot. Unlike typical characters, though, Stransky's disillusionment grows throughout the piece, until a nail-biting climax involving a Russian assault on a rubble-strewn German rail yard, the outcome of which is never clearly determined.Steiner and his men are the heroes of this film. They're dirty, underfed and fighting for their own survival. Their only loyalty is to each other. The Fatherland and higher callings don't matter &#150; when Stransky has a member of an SS squad transferred to Steiner's unit, the Sergeant promptly puts him in his place as a fellow infantryman. The difference between Nazis and ordinary men is drawn with bold, unmistakable strokes. Steiner's hate for all officers never appears less than genuine. He considers them to be career soldiers whose only aim is to make war. Kiesel actually makes this point late in the film when Brandt asks him, What we will do after the war? to which Kiesel replies, Prepare for the next one. Perhaps Steiner's view is unfair, but he sees Stransky as inept, and in the middle of a retreat, Brandt and Kiesel busy themselves with a formal investigation into Stransky's conduct. Perhaps a little more than the stake of the officer corps' reputation is at stake, eh? Something a bit more significant, like men's lives? Steiner's dedication to his brothers-in-arms shines through even when he is not in their presence. During an interlude at a hospital, he has a hallucination in which he pictures several of the patients as members of his squad. When one of them really does show up, he elects to return to combat instead of taking his awarded leave to the Fatherland. His commitment is to his men and only his men.The effects of combat have rarely been portrayed so starkly. The first example comes when Kern (Vadim Glowna) explodes at his comrades during a birthday party, which immediately follows a deadly, violent patrol. Later, in a quieter moment, Kruger (Klaus Lowitsch) is the lone survivor of a Russian bombardment. Steiner finds him in total shell shock; he can't move or let any emotion show through his voice. This scene is stark and moving. Battle sequences are brutal and intense. Peckinpah cuts rapidly from real-time to slow-motion very realistically. Many combat veterans say that time seems to slow down when you're in the midst of a firefight; here, we see things as a soldier would. Sometimes, the hand-held camera follows the men right into the trenches at a dizzying pace. At other moments, blood squibs and onrushing bodies are slowed incredibly.Peckinpah's film is ultimately a statement about the sheer madness that war is made up of. It's not necessarily anti-war, but it is brutally honest and unflinching. One scene set in a Russian shack, in which Steiner's squad captures several women prisoners, will become engraved in your memory due to its sheer graphic nature. Other lighter moments of soldiers' humor revolving around farting, lack of bathing facilities and pure dirty nature of trench warfare are simultaneously hilarious and grim. This is easily one of the most engaging films about warfare ever shot. The North American DVD is to be avoided; I highly recommend the UK DVD which contains an uncut widescreen transfer.

One scene set in a Russian shack, in which Steiner's squad captures several women prisoners, will become engraved in your memory due to its sheer graphic nature. Other lighter moments of soldiers' humor revolving around farting, lack of bathing facilities and pure dirty nature of trench warfare are simultaneously hilarious and grim. This is easily one of the most engaging films about warfare ever shot. The North American DVD is to be avoided; I highly recommend the UK DVD which contains an uncut widescreen transfer.

I agree the dialogue was pretty cheesy and the acting was pretty bad, but what do you expect on a low-budget 80's film? Some of the fashion was ugly yes, but com'on didn't we all wear that stuff in the 80s? I'm sure in the future the styles will change and everyone will be making fun of the clothes we wear now as well!The movie is about a young girl named Angela who's father and sibling die in a boat accident and is sent to live with her cousin and aunt who then becomes her adoptive mother. Eight years later her and her cousin are sent away to camp where Angela is harassed by most the other kids because she hardly ever speaks and is somewhat different (supposedly because of her tormenting experience). Soon after a lot of brutal murders begin to happen and nobody at the camp suspects who is doing them.Anyway I think the movie was ok. Not the best, but ok. I actually found it different then other horror movies in the 80's because it was more serious and disturbing, especially since most of the cast was kids. I definitely think the ending was the most shocking disturbing ending I've ever seen in a horror movie (well at least for the 80s). That was the thing that mostly was disturbing although there were a few other parts as well that were pretty disturbing and spooky.Spoilers ahead......For one thing the Mother at the beginning was freaky as hell! there is a reason why she is so scary, (besides the fact that she is nuts!) that's kinda explained in her last scene in the movie;which makes her even scarier and disturbing. Also there is a cook who is a rapist, an old man that dates a teenager and some graphic murder scenes as well as a few flashbacks of homosexuality and disturbing scenes. I still must say however that the ending is the most shocking horrifying part of the movie. I remembered me and my mom both had our mouths drooped out in shock! It's not really the identity of the killer that is shocking mean u probably won't be shocked when the killer is revealed at the end, but it is the killer's secret that will shock you. The very last scene before the credits come on will stick in your head for at least a little while. I was about 20 years when I saw this movie and I have to admit I actually couldn't sleep that night! I won't spoil the end for those of you who haven't seen it yet, but just remember to be prepared for a shock. I still get freaked out when I think of that movie. There are some unanswered questions in the movie as well that I still can't figure out, even after the ending. The ending explains a little bit but not everything, like some of those flashbacks so if anyone knows what I'm talking about let me know! I haven't seen part 2 or 3 yet cause I can't find them, I may have to buy them online. I'm hoping maybe the sequels will explain everything.

After one hundred years of film making, it is clear that film is, as Cocteau discovered, a poor storytelling device. It is a trivial failing for most Hollywood film makers. The way good lyrics get in the way of the music, a good story or screenplay gets in the way of movie making. Films are visceral. That is why films like the Panic Room get made.Unlike George Parker of Orange County California, I don't suggest you turn off your brain and enjoy the ride. David Fincher (Fight Club) and David Koepp (Spider Man) are Hollywood successes. Jody Foster is a legend. It is mainstream Hollywood that is responsible for this film, that is disturbing and ultimately, deserving of contempt.The premise of the Panic Room, stated in the first 20 minutes, is casually racist. We are presented with a vulnerable, white, rich, Jewish, first wife menaced by a large black man in work clothes, a man in corn rows, and a third named Raoul in a ski mask bought for the occasion. Fincher uses breast display to wring every bit of frisson from the possibility that Jody Foster will be raped (it's happened before). That the three men are not intent on rape is unimportant, what is important is that we become viscerally concerned for petite Jody Foster's safety. Jody Foster not Meg Altman.Let me summarize the hook is that sexually vulnerable, rich, white and maternal Jody Foster (again, not her character Meg Altman) is about to be raped by a large black man and two other ethnically challenged men. Believe it.Aside from the casual racism and sexism (consider the portrayal of male characters), there is a good deal of social Darwinism, but I don't have the stomach or time to discuss it. It would make me too angry to do anything else today.

That is why films like the Panic Room get made.Unlike George Parker of Orange County California, I don't suggest you turn off your brain and enjoy the ride. David Fincher (Fight Club) and David Koepp (Spider Man) are Hollywood successes. Jody Foster is a legend. It is mainstream Hollywood that is responsible for this film, that is disturbing and ultimately, deserving of contempt.The premise of the Panic Room, stated in the first 20 minutes, is casually racist. We are presented with a vulnerable, white, rich, Jewish, first wife menaced by a large black man in work clothes, a man in corn rows, and a third named Raoul in a ski mask bought for the occasion. Fincher uses breast display to wring every bit of frisson from the possibility that Jody Foster will be raped (it's happened before). That the three men are not intent on rape is unimportant, what is important is that we become viscerally concerned for petite Jody Foster's safety. Jody Foster not Meg Altman.Let me summarize the hook is that sexually vulnerable, rich, white and maternal Jody Foster (again, not her character Meg Altman) is about to be raped by a large black man and two other ethnically challenged men. Believe it.Aside from the casual racism and sexism (consider the portrayal of male characters), there is a good deal of social Darwinism, but I don't have the stomach or time to discuss it. It would make me too angry to do anything else today.

Then Martin returns home, and he and David start competing for Monica's love.  There's of course the scene where David stuffs his mechanical mouth with food, and his face starts to sag...creepy.
