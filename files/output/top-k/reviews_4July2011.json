Two decades have passed, and crime kingpin Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), now divorced from his wife Kay (Diane Keaton), has nearly succeeded in keeping his promise that his family would one day be completely legitimate. A philanthropist devoted to public service, Michael is in the news as the recipient of a special award from the Pope for his good works, a controversial move given his checkered past. Determined to buy redemption, Michael and his lawyer B.J. (George Hamilton) are working on a complicated but legal deal to bail the Vatican out of looming financial troubles that will ultimately reap billions and put Michael on the world stage as a major financial player. However, trouble looms in several forms The press is hostile to his intentions. Michael is in failing health and suffers a mild diabetic stroke. Stylish mob underling Joey Zaza (Joe Mantegna) is muscling into the Corleone turf. The Commission of Mafia families, represented by patriarch Altobello (Eli Wallach) doesn't want to let their cash cow Corleone out of the Mafia, though he has made a generous financial offer in exchange for his release from la cosa nostra. And then there's Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia), the illegitimate and equally temperamental son of Michael's long-dead brother Sonny. Vincent desperately wants in to the family (both literally and figuratively), and at the urging of his sister Connie (Talia Shire), Michael welcomes the young man and allows him to adopt the Corleone name. However, a flirtatious attraction between Vincent and his cousin, Michael's nave daughter Mary (Sofia Coppola) develops, and threatens to develop into a full-fledged romance and undo the godfather's future plans.so i finally finished watching the whole Trilogy, an epic saga, wow i feel relieved. i did it yes. so after a big gap, Mr. Coppola made this 3rd and final installment. this movie to be honest wasn't as good as the first two which to me were equally great but the first was a bit better.here we see the older days of Michael Corleone. much more politics is shown and involved in the story than before. its not a best narration or plot or written work but still good enough to deserve a watch and obviously it is a part of this epic movie saga.critics too didn't liked it as much as they did the others and audience seemed to be divided too. still it got 7 Oscar nominations but no surprise it didn't won any. it was nominated for Best Picture, Director, Actor in a Supporting role Andy Garcia, Film Editing, Art Direction, Cinematography and Original Song. Al Pacino didn't got any nomination.to be honest Andy Garcia did a nice job but i don't consider him to get nominated for Supporting actor Oscar or any other award. he sure was a bit good but nothing of a greater sort, a bit overrated he was in it. still i really liked his seriousness towards this movie. Al Pacino did a good job but not as good as before but still he was the best performer of this movie. excellent. Diane Keaton wasn't much here but still a nice work by her. Sofia Coppola wasn't the right choice to be honest but she wasn't the worst actress. she just wasn't ready for it. Direction suits best on her. other actors were just nice, not some big performances from the supporting cast as you might expect. there aren't many greats left here that is why. Talia Shire, Eli Wallach, Joe Mantegna , George Hamilton , Bridget Fonda , Raf Vallone , Franc D'Ambrosio and others.Direction was above average nothing great but still there is something that you will love.

He's also a pudgy loudmouth with a grating personality, so Herbert is encouraged to take a dive and allow Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), a handsome and charming college professor, to become the show's new champion. Audiences like Van Doren, and he's certainly not averse to the money he's winning, but the ethics of the situation begin to trouble him, especially when the show's producers begin to give him the questions in advance. Director Robert Redford and writer Paul Attanasio paint a telling portrait of how the network heads and advertising men who manipulated the quiz shows were also able to manipulate the responsibility for the scandal away from themselves. While on the surface a story about the scandal itself, Quiz Show is just as importantly about a turning point in the 1950s when TV and advertising began to change American character and culture. what a great compelling movie it was to be honest. i loved the experience. its a compelling watch and the best movie indeed by Robert Redford. i loved the whole basic idea of this movie about a quiz show a well known one where the producers, organizers and the sponsors sort of controlled a contestant asking him to Take a Dive and let the other one win. he is provided answers but before that he is being asked the questions he knew and they knew about them. this movie is about honesty, truth and dignity.this movie was nominated for 4 Oscars but not winning any of them.

Good Art Direction and Cinematography. really good showing that time period. the best thing is the Screenplay, what an outstanding screenplay it was absolutely flawless. awesome. plot and story is very good will make you glued to this movie and you won't loose your attention. it might get a bit shaky in few places but overall a superb work.really good performances by John Turturro, he was so good and perfect in his character.

Their current champ, Herbert Stempel (John Turturro), has a phenomenal memory and a broad range of knowledge. He's also a pudgy loudmouth with a grating personality, so Herbert is encouraged to take a dive and allow Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), a handsome and charming college professor, to become the show's new champion. Audiences like Van Doren, and he's certainly not averse to the money he's winning, but the ethics of the situation begin to trouble him, especially when the show's producers begin to give him the questions in advance.

I believe I heard the soundtrack first, because I was getting interested in electronic music at that point and still find Orbital's songs on the soundtrack to be very good. I was hanging with my 14 year old nephew and we were looking for a movie to watch on cable, so we came across Mortal Kombat. I lied and told him it was a good movie and it was free, so we figured what the heck? My brother joined us as he had never seen it. We laughed nonstop through this movie. Johnny Cage's moves were horrendous and it's not like the character required a good actor, which they didn't get anyways, so they could have paid a bit more for Jean Claude Van Damme and gotten a person with some acting experience as well as a person to pull off the martial arts believably. The guy who played Kano was horrible, as were his moves. The same goes for Sonja. The director butchered her patented hand standing move where she grabs a guy by his head with her legs and flips him over, or flings him through the air. Cables would have fixed this, but they didn't use them for that scene, however they did the same move with Liu Kang later in the movie. Goro is also hilarious to watch, and when he is supposed to do the move where he grabs an opponent and pummels him, the viewer is left with only this awkward sequence where Goro pounds the guy once due to the limitations of the animatronics involved. Reptile CGI looks OK in some parts, but really bad in others. At one point I started cracking up because this movie was starting to get ridiculous. The boat (sailboat) had bilge pumps and a see through floor built into the hull and I don't really picture Shang Tsung heading down below to observe sharks, coral, or manta rays. Scorpion and Sub Zero were on the same side, despite them being enemies. Towards the end I began laughing so hard I was crying, because Rayden's (Lambert) dialog was just too ridiculous for anyone to take it seriously. Rayden also does not fight in the tournament, despite having cool powers, and Lambert who has done action before. Some scenery and sets look good, while others are not so good. The scene on the deck of the boat was horrible, including the stars which looked like Christmas lights or holes poked through black paper in front of some lights. Would it have killed the producers to find a real boat and film at night? Acting was less that something I would expect in a 3rd grade play. Liu Kang was by far the most talented fighter in this production. Story made no real attempt to stick to the video game, which is surprising, because it's written by the game's creators. The stunt\/fighting choreography was less than I would expect from a theatrical release and I'm being polite. With all that being said I still had a great time watching this movie, as it made me nostalgic, gave me some quality time with my nephew, and I've never laughed so hard, even at a comedy. There's no shame in having a really bad movie that people will still watch years later. I'd rather watch this movie than some pretentious movie where everything is supposed to be so artistic. I will remember this movie like my parents remember the B movies from their past. 20 years from now I will watch this, but I wouldn't watch inception, or The Dark Knight.

OUT OF Africa, uncharacteristically for a Sydney Pollack film, was a bloated and unbearably boring biopic of a woman who at the end of the day was just not that interesting, despite a valiant attempt on the part of Meryl Streep in the lead. If I had been given a vote, and had to choose only an American-made film, I would have chosen THE COLOR PURPLE.But I digress. The best picture that I have ever seen that was made in 1985 was that year's winner for Best Foreign Language film Luis Puenzo's extraordinary debut film LA HISTORIA OFICIAL, better known to the English-speaking world as THE OFFICIAL STORY. For a first film, the director's hand is remarkably sure here; he knows the characters and the territory, and his handling of the actors produces what in the theatre is often known as magic. The film stars Norma Aleandro (in a fierce, towering performance that should have earned her an Oscar) as Alicia Marnet de Ibañez, a history teacher at a Buenos Aires high school, married to a successful businessman (Hector Alterio), raising their adopted five-year-old daughter Gaby (Analia Castro), and living the good life, blissfully, and one suspects later on, perhaps deliberately, unaware of what is happening and what has happened to her country in recent years (the film takes place shortly after the dirty war in which many Argentinians were rounded up, imprisoned, tortured, and killed). At first glance it seems incredible that a history teacher could be so blind to recent events, but as one of her students observes early in the film, History is written by assassins. Alicia sends the student from the room. But a seed has been planted. She attends a school reunion (I am not sure if it is high school or college; I suspect the latter, but in the end it makes little difference) and is reunited with her old friend Ana (Chunchuna Villafañe, who also delivers an Oscar-worthy performance), who has been living abroad, in exile, for the past seven years. Ana comes to Alicia's home for dinner; Alicia's husband Roberto is immediately suspicious and uneasy, but does his best to hide it. Later, after Roberto has gone to bed, the two women sit up talking and Ana reveals, in a devastating scene, the torture that she was subjected to because of her relationship with one of the enemies of the state. During this confession, Ana lets slip that many of the torture victims were pregnant women whose babies were stolen from them and sold to wealthy couples in secret adoptions, to which Alicia reacts almost violently Why are you telling me this?? Ana does not answer, but the seed that has been planted is starting to grow, and despite her love for her daughter, Alicia feels compelled to find out how her husband went about adopting the child. The strength of her bond with Gaby is displayed in a long, silent scene in which Alicia takes from the closet shelf the clothing the baby arrived in and looks at it with tears streaming down her face. But what has been set in motion cannot be stopped.I won't reveal any more. This is an exciting film, magnificently acted, written, and directed, and Aleandro's performance is one of the best pieces of work I have ever seen by any actor, male or female, and it is all the more remarkable because so much of it is internal. The camera lingers on Aleandro's face during key scenes as conflicting emotions flash by, one after the other, revealing both her inner turmoil and her resolve to discover the truth at any cost.A winner all around.

SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON (1939) or IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (1946), but it's a fine film. The story deals with a single father struggling to keep his Miami hotel business afloat while dreaming of bigger, better things. The material comes from a stage play, but there's a sense of the familiar Capra values. The Capra-esque resolution is not as powerful as in his earlier films, though, and isn't completely satisfying.The film has its weaknesses, but should not be dismissed. The movie is actually pretty funny at times, to go with the family-friendly themes. The cast is universally excellent and boasts Frank Sinatra (in single dad mode), the great Edward G. Robinson (hilarious as Sinatra's square older brother), the incomparable Thelma Ritter (as Eddie G.'s wife), Eleanor Parker (as a lonely widow), and even Keenan Wynn (as Sinatra's successful friend). Sinatra's on-screen son is played well by young Eddie Hodges and Sinatra's out-there, bongo-chick girlfriend is played by Carolyn Jones (Morticia Addams on The Addams Family).Robinson and Ritter are superb as the shop-owning husband and wife who fly down to Florida to help out Sinatra. Who knew Edward G. Robinson was so adept at comedy? The man could do it all. He's great complaining about his no-good brother, his hula-hooping embarrassment of a son, the peculiar rocking chair in Sinatra's room, and the holes in the ice cubes. Ritter is the voice of reason between the brothers and wants what is best for Sinatra's young son. Frank Sinatra does alright, playing a loving father who's still a playboy at heart. He struggles along financially, but never admits defeat.Apparently the script was adapted from a Yiddish play, which explains why Eddie G. and Thelma Ritter (and sometimes even Sinatra) seem to be doing some Jewish-style shtick. It's funny stuff, but it was a little odd thinking of Frank Sinatra coming from a Jewish family. (In the movie they're Italians, I guess.)Frank Capra's direction allows the actors time to inhabit the scenes. I noticed the many relatively long takes, which are always impressive. Scenes in Sinatra's living room feature the bickering brothers on opposite ends of the widescreen frame, with Ritter in the middle. The characters are standing up and sitting down and carrying on back and forth without the camera cutting away. Later, Sinatra and Hodges sit down together and sing High Hopes in one take and there seems to almost be a spontaneity to the duet (flubbed lines? ad-libs?).When hotel owner Sinatra is desperate for cash before an approaching deadline, we don't feel for him the way we feel for busted banker George Bailey. I guess it's because it seems that Sinatra's character put himself in that position. But considering that he needs to support his darling of a son, we feel sorry for Sinatra. Especially when we see him take what little money he has to the racetrack with his high-rolling buddy.One of Frank Capra's last movies, A HOLE IN THE HEAD has value at least as a curiosity. Frank Sinatra sharing the screen with Edward G. Robinson? Thelma Ritter thrown into the mix as Robinson's wife? The origin of the hit (and Oscar-winning) song High Hopes (familiar to fans of another film about a single dad and his son, A GOOFY MOVIE)? But I think the film also has merits of its own. There's some great comedy, particularly from Eddie G., and the widowed-father-meets-lovely-widow story might warm a few hearts.

Sinatra's on-screen son is played well by young Eddie Hodges and Sinatra's out-there, bongo-chick girlfriend is played by Carolyn Jones (Morticia Addams on The Addams Family).Robinson and Ritter are superb as the shop-owning husband and wife who fly down to Florida to help out Sinatra. Who knew Edward G. Robinson was so adept at comedy? The man could do it all. He's great complaining about his no-good brother, his hula-hooping embarrassment of a son, the peculiar rocking chair in Sinatra's room, and the holes in the ice cubes. Ritter is the voice of reason between the brothers and wants what is best for Sinatra's young son. Frank Sinatra does alright, playing a loving father who's still a playboy at heart. He struggles along financially, but never admits defeat.Apparently the script was adapted from a Yiddish play, which explains why Eddie G. and Thelma Ritter (and sometimes even Sinatra) seem to be doing some Jewish-style shtick. It's funny stuff, but it was a little odd thinking of Frank Sinatra coming from a Jewish family. (In the movie they're Italians, I guess.)Frank Capra's direction allows the actors time to inhabit the scenes. I noticed the many relatively long takes, which are always impressive. Scenes in Sinatra's living room feature the bickering brothers on opposite ends of the widescreen frame, with Ritter in the middle. The characters are standing up and sitting down and carrying on back and forth without the camera cutting away. Later, Sinatra and Hodges sit down together and sing High Hopes in one take and there seems to almost be a spontaneity to the duet (flubbed lines? ad-libs?).When hotel owner Sinatra is desperate for cash before an approaching deadline, we don't feel for him the way we feel for busted banker George Bailey. I guess it's because it seems that Sinatra's character put himself in that position. But considering that he needs to support his darling of a son, we feel sorry for Sinatra. Especially when we see him take what little money he has to the racetrack with his high-rolling buddy.One of Frank Capra's last movies, A HOLE IN THE HEAD has value at least as a curiosity. Frank Sinatra sharing the screen with Edward G. Robinson? Thelma Ritter thrown into the mix as Robinson's wife?

SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON (1939) or IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (1946), but it's a fine film. The story deals with a single father struggling to keep his Miami hotel business afloat while dreaming of bigger, better things. The material comes from a stage play, but there's a sense of the familiar Capra values. The Capra-esque resolution is not as powerful as in his earlier films, though, and isn't completely satisfying.The film has its weaknesses, but should not be dismissed.

But, according to the credits, it was Irving Berlin who suggested the idea. How much of the credit for the plot goes to Berlin, I don't know, but the story line actually is pretty good, better than some omnibus musicals, and better than some of Astaire's older movies (though not Top Hat). I liked the way Bing Crosby shows up on the Hollywood set at the end, which is a reproduction of his Holiday Inn; he had been writing songs for the movie within a movie based on his Holiday Inn. For those who aren't familiar with older American popular music, there is something called The Great American Songbook, which consists of great classics by about eight of America's best songwriters. I think the other seven would concur that Irving Berlin was the greatest of them all. No one has written more enduring classics than Berlin, and he often wrote the words, too. Yet he had no formal musical education; he was a natural genius of the highest order. I saw Irving Berlin's photo and paperwork at the museum on Ellis Island, fittingly, near a display of Maria von Trapp, both immigrants to America. Ironically, he was not born in America, yet wrote some of America's most patriotic music, including God Bless America, and was Jewish, yet wrote perhaps the most popular Christmas song, White Christmas. With songs like White Christmas and Easter Parade, Holiday Inn might sound like a natural to show to children, perhaps a school class, especially around a holiday. But you should watch the movie first, because there is a little problem the racial stereotypes. The one that sticks out like a sore thumb is the Lincoln's Birthday song and dance number, which includes Bing Crosby and Marjorie Reynolds in blackface, along with black performers in some hokey costumes. The pretext is that Bing wants to hide Reynolds from Astaire, who is looking for his Cinderella dance partner. And then there's Louise Beavers, who plays a stereotyped black housekeeper, Mamie. Look at her extensive credits on IMDb, which included the starring in the pioneering TV series, Beulah in 1952. Plus there are her stage children, Shelby Bacon and Joan Arnold, who also play stereotyped black children. Beavers does not portray a bad person, a negative stereotype; on the contrary, she is a kind, considerate person. The problem is no human being would behave like that, naturally; as an actress she plays a stereotyped subservient black persona, and some blacks in actual life had to play similar personas, but I doubt all blacks behaved in such an artificial way, especially when living in a white household. I had relatives in the South who had a black cook, and she behaved like any other person, and was treated respectfully. The heavy Southern dialect was also a bit much, suggesting an uneducated person, given this was set in Connecticut. Aside from the stereotypes, the roles are not terribly negative, when you consider that Hollywood often stereotyped all sorts of roles, including Gus, the hick taxi driver in the movie. Hollywood musicals are not generally known for their realism. And Holiday Inn was made 70 years ago, during World War II, when audiences wanted escapist fare. I think if this is shown to children, there should be some discussion of the racial issues; perhaps it can be a learning experience for blacks and whites. But I think it would be a mistake to censor scenes from the movie or to refuse to show it, altogether. It is not that bad, and on the plus side, it is such a typical example of black stereotyping that it is classic. Another option, of course, would be to show excerpts of numbers like White Christmas or Easter Parade.Astaire was always trying to find new angles for his dance numbers. The most eye catching here is the Fourth of July number where he dances to the accompaniment of exploding firecrackers. There is also a creative piece where he shows up drunk at Holiday Inn, and stumbles into an unusual dance with Linda Mason (Reynolds), whom he is too drunk the remember the next day. This is a fun movie, but it is bittersweet because of the way they treated the black actors. It should be noted that Astaire was certainly not a racist, and had great respect for the black tap dancers whose performances he studied and admired. Thankfully, America has changed enormously, with people of all races in all sorts of jobs and positions of power. And this movie, by contrast, helps highlight how much progress has been made in 70 years. But, sadly, the attitudes of many Americans, including many in Congress, has not changed nearly enough. But Hollywood abandoned such racial stereotypes long ago, in case you hadn't noticed. One fine example is Lilies of the Field, starring Sidney Poitier made in 1963, nearly 50 years ago. I mention this because foreigners often seem to have all sorts of outdated stereotypes and prejudices about America.

The entire film would have collapsed like a house of cards if they had introduced a green skinned woman with a pointy hat at the end (LOL). Instead, we got a very cool ending. Along the way, you'll have to endure some overbearing acting by the female lead, but overall, this is worth watching at least once. You probably won't feel the need to watch it again after that for quite a long time, but it is an enjoyable experience nonetheless. It unfortunately typecast the actors (especially the female lead) forever as that guy\/girl in Blair Witch, but the men who made this film undoubtedly had no need to ever work again after this (budget $60,000 for a gross of $248 million, you do the math..). Definitely a one trick, one time pony, but an amusing one.

And with the passing of years, I discovered Al Pacino's glorious filmography, through Scarface, The Godfather trilogy, Carlito's Way, Heat, Dog Day Afternoon, Serpico &#x85; and Scent of a Woman for a mysterious reason was a movie that I wasn't in a hurry to watch. How wrong I was  as soon as I finally finished the film, I knew I just saw Al Pacino's role that cut straight into my heart the most directly, after Michael Corleone.Scent of a Woman is a two-hour and half movie that never seems too long because it absolutely knows where it goes. The slow pacing is important as it provides enough time to be familiar with the two main characters  Chris O'Donnell as Charlie Simms, a shy young 17-year old boy who studies on aid in Baird, a prestigious prep school and Al Pacino as Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, a flamboyant, crude and rude war veteran blind since an accidental drunk game. They couldn't have been more opposite but as we expect in a script whose intelligence emanates from the first minutes, we'll get to know more beyond these archetypal facades and each character will learn about and from the other. It's a coming of age story lead by one of the most memorable and inspiring characters of the last decade  Colonel Slade, with his priceless onomatopoeic motto  Hoo-ah!.Charlie Simms is an insecure student whose modest background impacted his personality. He's surrounded by arrogant daddy's boys, among them, George Willis, a young scene-stealing Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Charlie's financial situation makes him an obvious outcast in the prestigious Baird School, forced to accept a weekend job, to earn money. His job would be to nurse a grumpy and totally obnoxious old man, unknowing that he's just about to live the most important days in his life, with New York as the setting. Meanwhile, he and George happen to be the unintentional witnesses of the setting of what would be a humiliating prank. The victim is played by the ultimate character actor of the 90's, James Rebhorn as Trask, the school's headmaster. Charlie and George have all the weekend to think about the eventuality of denouncing their friends under the threat of exclusion, an unbearable ethic dilemma for Charlie. And we quite understand the incertitude and anguish he'll display all through his trip with Colonel Slade.The movie literally takes off when Charlie and Slade move to New York, and we get to know more about the Colonel and understand the fascination he inspires us. He's a man whose blindness developed other sensory powers that target one specific category of persons  women. No other character spoke of women like Colonel Slade, who developed a particular ability to identify any feminine fragrance. The trip to New York will be the opportunity for Charlie to have a small taste of all the pleasures that can govern our lives  eating, drinking, dancing a tango with a beautiful girl like Donna, a name that resonates as a probable homage to the original Italian movie, Dino Risi's Profumo di Donna and speaking of Italians, there is also riding a Ferrari, and trying an awkward but sincere reconciliation with the family, and ultimately fighting the inner demons. Beyond the whole mentor-disciple relationship, darker undertones are hidden  Slade's eagerness to seize each hour, each moment of the precious weekend, are the morbid allegory of the last meal before execution. Slade basically savors some last pleasures before shooting himself to death. And then it's time for Charlie to overcome his passive nature before it's too late.This is the aspect that definitely marks the movie's greatness. Slade learns that we never have nothing to lose for suicide is the ultimate failure, and a total waste because nothing is never worth to be enjoyed just because we're blind, crippled, or have no money. Simms mirrors Slade's condition during a heartbreaking climactic moment that will consolidate their friendship, when both of them are in dead-ends. Simms learns that George's father will probably interfere and that he might defend his case alone but how could Slade be in a dead end, with all he taught to Charlie during a memorable weekend. These scenes are realistically handled, avoiding what could have been cinematic stereotypical sappiness. And at these moments, you understand that no other actor could have played the character with such fierce intensity in his lifeless eyes.The movie concludes with the resolution of the Baird case where Slade, as a moral debt, decided to defend his protégé and new friend Charlie. In one hell of a speech like only Al Pacino, with his volcanic voice, could have delivered, he spits on the hypocrisy of a system that condemns the high morality of a boy who refuses to snitch, and spare the one who talked, under the control of daddy. It's Kirkland, Wortzik and Serpico resurrecting in a histrionic virtuosity and metamorphosing a bunch of puppets-students into wannabe men. The movie's inspirational message of integrity rewards two hours of a patient character study as finally, Charlie Simms also opened the eyes of Colonel Slade during that weekend.And as many noticed, there's the beautiful melody of City lights that inhabits the film. I think this is also a nice touch that reminded us of the true universal message that I mentioned in my review of Chaplin's masterpiece, quoting the French writer Antoine de Saint Exupery  it is only with the heart that one can see rightly, what is essential is invisible to the eye, that's what Charlie's initiation, a lesson even Colonel Slade was about to forget, but fortunately, did not.

He's always a great director, his films are very sharp and he knows exactly how to balance drama and comedy in a perfect composition, looks like a great chemist and this film is quite a surprise if you consider his other works. But it is equally great! In Lásky Jedné Plavovlásky (Loves of a Blonde) Hana Brejchová plays Andula, a pretty young girl living in a small city whose majority is formed by young girls like her waiting for a nice boy to appear. We follow Andula and her friends during a party where they are seen as object of adoration by three soldiers out of duty and way out the girls league since they're quite old for them but they insist with them dancing and paying a bottle of wine they don't even want. But in the same party, there's Milda (Vladimír Pucholt) a young pianist interest in Andula, also a persistent guy who liked Andula and keeps most part of the film trying to make a move on her. He'll be more successful than the soldiers but the destiny awaits some surprises for him...and for her too.Loves of a Blonde is a humored tale about a woman's journey to the discover of the first love, the enchantments and disenchantment's of it, but also about that old talk about woman's virtue, the value of female honor in not hanging out with too many boys at the same time because this wasn't seen in good eyes by the society (you'll see this in the school scene where the teacher says that to the girls and they make a pledge based on a elevated moral behavior). I quote as old talk because times are way different than the one presented in the film and people have another values in terms of almost everything, so what was a something that only men could do, now women can do too if they want; if boys can date or kiss several girls, girls can do the same. It's a quite updated view this film had back in the 1960's in showing Andula trying to not flirt with soldiers in one way but end up talking to them, then later to have a romantic evening with Milda and...she already had a boyfriend as we discover way later. Even though some might condemn this kind of behavior, in the film is presented without any vulgarity and without any excess; it's well humored, very simple and it doesn't demand much from the viewers to make them laugh; laughter comes naturally with Loves of a Blonde. Among the best moments of the film are the soldier who lost his wedding ring in the ballroom during the party (the whole segment of the party is funny with the unsure soldiers trying to make a move on the girls, then the girls keep saying to themselves they don't the guys near them but can't stop looking at them); Milda's insistent moves on Andula that even includes teaching her how to defend herself from guys like him; the I don't have a girl in Prague quote Milda keeps saying trying to amuse the girl saying she's the only one in his life; and segment with Andula visiting Milda's irritating parents (although this moment got more irritating than funny, specially because of the mom, one of the most annoying characters ever presented in a film).
