He's unbearable, boring and I don't know how to cast him as a police officer in the first place ??!! I remember how the routine he did about the old telephone with (Joe Pecsi) was the lowest bottom the whole 4 movies hit.

Notice well the way (Gibson) says Hi Gaaaang to the evil guys near the end to understand how nothing was taken seriously this round. This is the first LW movie where Murtaugh's hair is all black ?! Simply to make you forget about the unspoken matter of retirement! The action wasn't that good, maybe Li's fighting only. The whole sequence of the car chase was nothing compared to the action that these movies used to deliver, like for instance the chase of part 3, which I expected something better than it, or at least as good. Furthermore, the final battle began so clumsy, then ended up as extremely violent.. I hated both its parts.Anyhow, the plot was nice, as well as the theme of We're not getting' too old for this s**t!. The shot in which the leads' car jumps into a building to land safely without harming anybody or anything sure is the most cartoonish moment in the series, and I like it. I loved the music. However it made me reminisce about the last 3 movies more than expressing any memorable scene in this installment, except the what took you so long?! scene which I see it as the best one here. Well, overall there was fun. But not for long! At one TV interview, in 2004 I think, one interviewer asked Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon 5 what would.. to have the last interrupting him to assure decisively There will not be Lethal Weapon 5!. To tell you the truth I felt happy. And I felt that they didn't like working in this one at all. The ending was still being written while the movie was in production (!). I didn't see anything they added in this one. And I didn't see something it added to anyone was in it! The musical finale, of the movie and the whole series, did give this one some necessity.

Then finally, and very late I think, I had the chance to watch it..Yes, there are bad points. The shark doesn't look that scary. The storyline of it wasn't that thrilling. Since the shark was killed in the first, then its son was killed in the second; who was revenging in this one?!! Despite how Lorraine Gary is a good actress, she isn't an attractive lead. The reiteration of shots, and scene, from the original was boring and not in this one's sake. They killed the shark by the electricity; exactly like part 2 (!). There were 2 scenes where the shark attacks to turn out to be a dream. There were 2 identical tricks at the climax (Michael Caine was considered dead, then he's alive, then the same with Mario Van Peebles after a few minutes !). By the way I don't know how Peebles was alive at the end? The shark ate him already; so whether it vomited him after a short time?, or he got himself released while the shark was exploding?; but even if, how he wasn't killed by the electric power that shocked the shark ?? And yes, Caine's shirt was dry while he was getting out of the water! There are love scenes between the pilot and the mother. And maybe they added love scenes between the young son and his wife to compensate the oldness of first couple. But anyhow there is not enough focusing on Jaws. And that's the main big mistake this movie did.Furthermore, it missed the substance. There is no serious shadow for anything. In fact anything serious, or supposed to be, ended after the original. So it's a revenge story, and that's it. Sure being in TV-ish condition and less strong than its antecedent; part 3 as well, disappointed the fans very at the moment.Nevertheless, that doesn't make this movie horrible. It wasn't a crappy time. I didn't run into many idiot situations or huge plot holes. In relation to the most hateful matters; I saw that the shark's roar is artistic touch more than scientific error.

The traveling of the shark after the family from New England to the Bahamas wasn't firstly perceptible for me, however that was to assure the ravenousness of the revenge anyway. This stuff is nearly in every movie, but maybe there was no remainder mercy this time. The special effects were decent. The performance was so good, especially every moment of (Caine).

And Karen Young was charming. Well, it's not a monster. It's the exploitative sequel and in low tone. But so watchable and better than part 2 also.I believe the budget limited everything, defining what character was wanted for this movie from the start. So the script provided simple and harmless 90 minutes to entertain. Clearly, the audience expected more. And with the aforementioned points they couldn't care less! But I do care.

On the way, the slaves, led by Cinque finds a way to open the chains around him and rebels, causing the death of almost the whole crew. However, the ship was still directed towards the United States, where the Africans were captured and brought to trial under murder. In the court, several of factions claim the ownership of the slaves, and try to seize them away. The 11 year old Isabella II of Spain, two Spaniards who own La Amistad and the American ship who found the slaves are these people who want the slaves for themselves. In the middle of this struggle we find to abolitionists who want the salves to be free. They receive help of the lawyer Baldwin who puts his career at stake in order to free the slaves.The film itself is a visual wonder. Spielberg sets the film in a special dark mood which brings out the intensity of each character individual. With use of great camera angel and perfect choice of weather the film becomes real to us. At times, the film can be very slow and very systematic. Spielberg shows several times in the movie that he's one of the best directors out there. In for example the opening scene, a scene of Cinque's family, and the brutal voyage of the slaves to America is altogether stunningly made. It is this emotional force that carries us throughout the film. Matthew McConaughey (Baldwin) is superb acting as the lawyer defending the slaves, Anthony Hopkins (John Quincy Adams) is sensational playing as the old Adams and Morgan Freeman (Joadson) is just outstanding in his scenes. The rest of the cast is also quite good, but the movie, however, belongs to Djimon Hounsou (Cinque). His emotional performing is just brilliant. Spielberg manages to make the slowest scenes to glow with focus on Hounsou. One thing that the director impressed me with was how Cinque and his people were presented. The first scene leaves us an impression that the Africans are simply brutal. As the story in the film moves on we get to know them better despite language difficulties. Also when truth unravels we quickly change which side were cheering for.The main theme in this film must be about freedom. What is it and how does one determine who is free? In 1839, those questions were more difficult to answer then they are now. I found the film quite interesting with this theme, because the film itself brings up something that are so important to the Africans back in 1839, but we don't think of freedom as much as people used to back in the older days.

The 11 year old Isabella II of Spain, two Spaniards who own La Amistad and the American ship who found the slaves are these people who want the slaves for themselves. In the middle of this struggle we find to abolitionists who want the salves to be free. They receive help of the lawyer Baldwin who puts his career at stake in order to free the slaves.The film itself is a visual wonder. Spielberg sets the film in a special dark mood which brings out the intensity of each character individual. With use of great camera angel and perfect choice of weather the film becomes real to us. At times, the film can be very slow and very systematic. Spielberg shows several times in the movie that he's one of the best directors out there. In for example the opening scene, a scene of Cinque's family, and the brutal voyage of the slaves to America is altogether stunningly made. It is this emotional force that carries us throughout the film. Matthew McConaughey (Baldwin) is superb acting as the lawyer defending the slaves, Anthony Hopkins (John Quincy Adams) is sensational playing as the old Adams and Morgan Freeman (Joadson) is just outstanding in his scenes. The rest of the cast is also quite good, but the movie, however, belongs to Djimon Hounsou (Cinque). His emotional performing is just brilliant. Spielberg manages to make the slowest scenes to glow with focus on Hounsou. One thing that the director impressed me with was how Cinque and his people were presented. The first scene leaves us an impression that the Africans are simply brutal. As the story in the film moves on we get to know them better despite language difficulties. Also when truth unravels we quickly change which side were cheering for.The main theme in this film must be about freedom. What is it and how does one determine who is free? In 1839, those questions were more difficult to answer then they are now. I found the film quite interesting with this theme, because the film itself brings up something that are so important to the Africans back in 1839, but we don't think of freedom as much as people used to back in the older days. Through the film we get to see how important freedom actually is and that it never shall be forgotten as we have learned from the mistakes of our forefathers.

The first thing that made me worry was the opening scene, which is set in what is presumably a Roman Catholic Church. There was obviously no effort whatsoever made to ensure that the service was accurately portrayed (for example -the Lord's Prayer which is recited was not the Catholic version, but the reformist Protestant one, which is never used in a Roman Catholic service). If filmmakers decide to set a plot in any particular geographical location or ethnic community they should show at least enough respect to get the basics right. This on its own is a minor point but it was only the beginning and should have warned me about what was to come. It seems that the only reason that the main characters are Irish is to fulfil the necessary religious link needed by the movie title, by using the stereotypical off-the-shelf Irish Catholic, hard drinking, hard fighting but with a heart of gold model. It would have been far better to have done without the painful attempts at an Oirish accent which were amongst the worst since Finian's Rainbow and painful to an Irish ear. (If you want to see how it is possible for non-Irish actors to get the accent perfect watch The Proposition.) All of these faults aside the movie could still have been entertaining. Unfortunately the plot is so weak and predictable that not even an actor of the quality of Willem Dafoe could save it. I had to struggle with the desire to switch this movie off after the first twenty minutes, something I almost never do. There are a lot of movies in this genre and my advice is to pick a different one &#x96; especially if you're Irish.

My dad and Nan are big fans of old movies and told me that Some Like It Hot is a hilariously brilliant film.When I went for my weekly lecture I had good hope that this film would be good, but I didn't expect it to be brilliant. I was wrong it was amazing. Now wonder this has been deemed one of Hollywood's golden age classic comedies.The basic story is about two male musicians played by Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis who are struggling to make ends meet in Chicago when they witness mobsters committing murder. They inevitably get caught witnessing the crime but escape the criminals unscathed but they get blood all over them and soon know they will be wanted men so they decide to join an all girl band that is travelling to Florida as the agency that they work for need two girls who are a saxophonist and a bass player.They dress up as the two women, but it's not that simple come arrive in Florida. They both fall for the singer of the girl band Sugar played deliciously by the sexy Marilyn Monroe and also attract attention from a rich millionaire (Well Jack Lemon does) and Tony Curtis dressing up in a captains outfit to woo Marilyn whilst at the same time trying to keep in disguise.This movie is hilarious. I was laughing all the way through. The comic chemistry between Curtis and Lemmon is superb. The timing of there comic antics is spot on. It becomes particularly funny when they are in the women's clothing and become Josephine and Daphne. Some of the antics I loved was when Curtis first dresses up as a captain and when Lemon as Daphne is doing the tango with he rich millionaire with a rose in his mouth had me crying with laughter. Also it's great fun when the Mobsters catch up with the two later and try and get away from them and the ending particularly when the rich millionaire finds out that Daphne is a man quotes the best line from the film. When Lemon reveals himself to be a man as he tells the rich millionaire he can't marry him because he's male, he dosen't care just as he dosen't care that 'Daphne smokes' etc. He says Nobody's perfect Very funny indeed! Of course Mariyln Monroe has to be mentioned for her part in the film she makes a great impact on screen and not just because of her looks, she has great acting ability and a nice singing voice too. But it wasn't just the acting and the gags they were funny, they were also witty and inventive and that is partly in thanks to a superb script by great director Billy Wilder. He also edits this beautifully and the narrative has a great structure and well the story of men dressing up as women is great too! I was also pleased with the length of the film. Some may say two hours would be too long for this sort of film, but it sub stains itself. I couldn't find anything to fault about this film and at the end of watching it in the lecture me and my classmates clapped and gave it a standing ovation.I will certainly watch this movie in the future and I recommend that if you haven't seen this yet even if your a teenager like me you should see this you will regret it if you don't.

The plot is entertaining the first time you watch the movie, and even comical in some parts, but if you actually pay attention to what is being said you will realize that a lot of it doesn't even make sense, especially the idea that Aaron has multiple personality disorder.The fact that Martin actually believes him is surprising because in the scene where they first meet Aaron tells him that he saw a figure in the room where Rushman was murdered before he blacked out. Later the other person in the room, the one who killed the archbishop, is determined by Martin and by a psychiatrist to be his other personality, Roy. So he saw the other person...then turned into him? This may make sense if Aaron is schizophrenic as well, believing he sees Roy and talks to him. Later, when Roy makes his first appearance to Martin, he knows perfectly well who Aaron is and everything that happens in his other personality's life. However, when Aaron is asked during the trial if he knows who Roy is, he says he does not. So Martin should not be so surprised when Aaron\/Roy reveals that they are the same person.That element of the story bothered me the most. What also annoyed me is how Aaron\/Roy's story was never fully explained. If he did commit murder on purpose, why? Is it because of the sexual abuse? Did he have a disturbed childhood, or was he lying about that? It's up to the viewer to decide. I also didn't like how Martin Vail was never characterized completely. Is he an arrogant jerk, a genuinely kind and compassionate person, or both? Is he an arrogant jerk who's trying to reform? The tag line of the movie is Sooner or later a man with two faces forgets which one is real. Who is this referring to? Rushman is said to be two-faced because he acted like a saint in public but was a sex maniac who took advantage of the vulnerable, but the story is never seen from his point of view, and we never receive evidence that he forgot which side was real. Aaron is also two-faced, but he knows this. Martin Vail, however, does not appear to be two-faced.

Based on The Chronicles of Prydain by Lloyd Alexander, this Disney animated fantasy attempted to adapt the first two books of the series (The Book of Three and The Black Cauldron) and make a grand film. The film has an infamous production history, as pre-production started as far back as 1971. The newly recruited Disney artists who were working on Robin Hood and The Rescuers (including Don Bluth) were hoping that this film would eventually become a Disney film that Walt would have never dreamed of, an epic fantasy. Unfortunately, the executives were very play it safe at the time, so the project was put on hold. Finally, in 1980, full production began on the project and it was aiming to be a very dark fantasy film aimed at teenagers. At the time, anything with the Disney name on it was avoided by teens and adults, and thus Disney hid their names on the theatrical posters for PG-rated films like Tron, Tex and Something Wicked this Way Comes.The resulting film is a mess, but it's not a horrible film. In fact, the ambition alone makes it worth watching. Seeing Disney at least try to do a dark fantasy film is a miracle. The first problem is the muddled storyline. The film takes many liberties with the books and takes various sections of the first two books and tries to make a plot out of them to fit an 80-minute film.The story, in the land of Prydain is a Black Cauldron. Whoever gets the Cauldron can rule the world or destroy it. A young boy named Taran on the farm of Caer Dallben dreams of being a warrior and getting respect, rather than being an assistant pig keeper. What the young boy doesn't know is that the pig, Hen Wen, is psychic and can read visions. She knows the location of The Black Cauldron. Unfortunately, a terrifying warlord known as The Horned King knows about the pig and is searching for the cauldron. The Horned King plans to resurrect an army of dead soldiers and destroy everything in the land of Prydain. The enchanter Taran is working for, Dallben, tells Taran to take Hen Wen and hide her in a hidden cottage in the forest. Taran begins his journey into the forest with the pig, but he daydreams of becoming a warrior. The pig runs off and is captured by The Horned King's flying beasts, the Gwythaints. Taran goes into The Horned King's castle to rescue Hen Wen. All goes wrong, Hen Wen escapes and Taran is locked in the dungeon. There he meets Princess Eilonwy (stolen by the Horned King) and an old bard named Fflewddur Fflam. Together, with the small creature Gurgi, the team go on a quest to get The Black Cauldron before The Horned King finds it.While the plot sounds alright, the way its executed is a mess. The first half is great, but once Taran meets Eilonwy and Fflewddur, all seems to get muddled. All leads up to a very exciting climax. On the bright side, it has some very good animation and impressive background artwork (Although some may disagree). It is also the first Disney animated film to use computer generated imagery (not The Great Mouse Detective).One big flaw is the editing, but don't blame the makers of this film, blame Jeffrey Katzenberg. He saw the completed film and being inexperienced and thinking that you can edit animated films, he edited out a lot of violent scenes that would've gotten the film a PG-13 or R rating.

Based on The Chronicles of Prydain by Lloyd Alexander, this Disney animated fantasy attempted to adapt the first two books of the series (The Book of Three and The Black Cauldron) and make a grand film. The film has an infamous production history, as pre-production started as far back as 1971. The newly recruited Disney artists who were working on Robin Hood and The Rescuers (including Don Bluth) were hoping that this film would eventually become a Disney film that Walt would have never dreamed of, an epic fantasy. Unfortunately, the executives were very play it safe at the time, so the project was put on hold. Finally, in 1980, full production began on the project and it was aiming to be a very dark fantasy film aimed at teenagers. At the time, anything with the Disney name on it was avoided by teens and adults, and thus Disney hid their names on the theatrical posters for PG-rated films like Tron, Tex and Something Wicked this Way Comes.The resulting film is a mess, but it's not a horrible film. In fact, the ambition alone makes it worth watching. Seeing Disney at least try to do a dark fantasy film is a miracle. The first problem is the muddled storyline. The film takes many liberties with the books and takes various sections of the first two books and tries to make a plot out of them to fit an 80-minute film.The story, in the land of Prydain is a Black Cauldron. Whoever gets the Cauldron can rule the world or destroy it. A young boy named Taran on the farm of Caer Dallben dreams of being a warrior and getting respect, rather than being an assistant pig keeper. What the young boy doesn't know is that the pig, Hen Wen, is psychic and can read visions. She knows the location of The Black Cauldron. Unfortunately, a terrifying warlord known as The Horned King knows about the pig and is searching for the cauldron. The Horned King plans to resurrect an army of dead soldiers and destroy everything in the land of Prydain. The enchanter Taran is working for, Dallben, tells Taran to take Hen Wen and hide her in a hidden cottage in the forest. Taran begins his journey into the forest with the pig, but he daydreams of becoming a warrior. The pig runs off and is captured by The Horned King's flying beasts, the Gwythaints. Taran goes into The Horned King's castle to rescue Hen Wen. All goes wrong, Hen Wen escapes and Taran is locked in the dungeon. There he meets Princess Eilonwy (stolen by the Horned King) and an old bard named Fflewddur Fflam. Together, with the small creature Gurgi, the team go on a quest to get The Black Cauldron before The Horned King finds it.While the plot sounds alright, the way its executed is a mess. The first half is great, but once Taran meets Eilonwy and Fflewddur, all seems to get muddled. All leads up to a very exciting climax. On the bright side, it has some very good animation and impressive background artwork (Although some may disagree). It is also the first Disney animated film to use computer generated imagery (not The Great Mouse Detective).One big flaw is the editing, but don't blame the makers of this film, blame Jeffrey Katzenberg. He saw the completed film and being inexperienced and thinking that you can edit animated films, he edited out a lot of violent scenes that would've gotten the film a PG-13 or R rating.

I was intrigued by the itinerant field workers and the life style, coming in on top of railroad cars, dropped off deliberately (I did wonder how they would have passed under overpasses, but that's a silly sidetrack. We have a young narrator who gives us her slant on the events transpiring, an insightful teenager. We then have the Richard Gere character, looking mighty fine, who is really hiding out. I'm not sure why the ruse with the almost incestuous slant, but that's the way it is. Ultimately, everyone is lost in the wheat fields and what happens is so isolated that the rest of world doesn't care. The visuals, though, are amazing, especially the night the grasshoppers invade and the kingdom falls into ruin because of a fire that destroys the crop. I'm glad I got a chance to finally see this.

Unusually for Hollywood, this feels like a small film, and it hasn't really dated, to the great credit of everyone involved. It's a neat, tightly-told story of the flight into hiding of Samuel, a young Amish boy (Lukas Haas) who makes an expedition into the big city with his mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis), and there witnesses a brutal murder. In their flight to the safety of their Amish farming community, they pick up baggage &#x96; a Philadelphia cop, John Book (a super-charismatic 80's Harrison Ford) &#x96; along the way. A damaged Book seeks to protect them by becoming part of their community, and in turn his are the eyes through which we learn about the Amish. But inevitably the ripples his presence make in this serene community spread continually wider, until finally the trouble &#x96; and the city - comes to them.The screen chemistry between McGillis and Ford is electric, and you don't feel as if they've been clanged together (as in most modern romances) they were simply walking towards each other from the first. In addition to being a fine romance and a bit of a thriller, it's a window on a closed world, respectfully scripted and shot. It's the least boisterous, and most contemplative piece of Hollywood that I've seen in many years how often is an alternative vision of America presented, in such a way as to suggest that it may even offer a superior quality of life to that of modern America? Very rare ingredients indeed. Mind you, I'd expect no less from the director of the surprisingly thoughtful Master and Commander. It brings to mind small British films like Angela Pope's Captives, and David Leland's The Land Girls.

Upon my first viewing I was incredibly boggled and the film definitely f**ked with my mind. Once it was finished and the plot straightened out in my mind and upon subsequent viewing, I definitely began to appreciate and thoroughly enjoy the film. Not surprisingly for Kubrick, the film is original and definitely intriguing. Cruise and Kidman, as usual, delivered great performances as Alice and Bill Harford. The plot took unexpected turns and brings confusion to the viewer, but worthwhile confusion. I recommend purchasing the film as I feel that subsequent viewings are necessary to fully comprehend and appreciate Eyes Wide Shut.
