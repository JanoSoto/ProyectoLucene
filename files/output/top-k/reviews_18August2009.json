[{"date":"18 August 2009","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" What a find 1997 Irish film I Went Down turned out to be; a film that greatly reminded me of Stephen Frears' 1984 film entitled The Hit and one that packs in just about everything from crime to comedy; from the gangster genre to the road movie arc and from the buddy sub-genre to the sorting out of romances with loved ones. I Went Down doesn't ever exploit nor does it trivialise its subject matter and nor does it ever loose focus by lurching down one route by way of centring too much on one of the many ingredients it takes on. The film is a balanced buddy comedy, veering off into scenes of great disturbance and wrong-doing in a timely and tasteful manner but retaining a certain 'feel' to it; a certain heart.Some of the central themes to I Went Down revolve around relationships between human beings. The placement of I Went Down in the 'road movie' narrative arc enables the two central protagonists and a third character, who's being transported, to bond for long periods in a lone location as they physically travel together. The leads are Git Hynes (McDonald), a young man just out of prison, and Bunny Kelly (Gleeson), a rough and ready if somewhat clumsy criminal that has his own way in which to see that the job's done. They are charged by a certain criminal boss named Tom French (Doyle) to travel to Cork and recover Frank Grogan (Caffrey) before taking him to a remote, rural location (always a dangerous place in these noir-infused tales) for supposed judgement.The film recalls 1984's The Hit as a film about two men, of rather unbalanced 'types' transport a third, seemingly more helpless man, to his supposed death. Whereas John Hurt's silent and experienced gangster was in direct comparison to Tim Roth's younger and more scociopathic up-coming criminal; Gleeson and McDonald's two leads are explored more physically; as one exhibits short, wiry and somewhat soft-bodied characteristics as opposed to a much larger, clumsy and more 'involving' individual that likes the attention and action. In both The Hit and I Went Down, the supposedly hapless victim wears a face of acceptance; he sits in the rear of the car and seems cool with his dangerous predicament; and while Terrance Stamp will forever be better known, Peter Caffrey's performance as the upbeat and talkative soon-to-be-in-mortal-danger individual goes down rather well.Some of the things I noticed early on included an amusing dig at BSkyB, probably on behalf of the BBC who co-funded this, when it appears some gangsters have it in mind that taking a man out back, sitting him down in front of the TV and tuning into a Sky Sports channel is a dreadful punishment. I also got the sense that Git, the lead, wasn't imposing enough or rugged enough to carry the sort of character he was playing, although this was sort of the point in the sense his partner, Bunny, took on the necessary conventions. By the end, we've met some pretty rough and ready characters; those that are involved in murder and criminal activity whereas Git, as this alienated young man more-so a gangster, just seems to share this space with these people in an out-of-his-depth predicament. The tactic here being able to get across a sense of vulnerability in one of the leads, someone who is involved with people but doesn't share the criminally efficient mindset, best demonstrated with Git's surprise when it transpires Bunny has unexpectedly robbed a petrol station.So if Git is the glue around which the story unravels, then it is Bunny who undergoes the most interesting of transformations. Both men reveal some pretty deep feelings as well as tales as they sit at a dark, glum-looking and smoky hotel bar &#x96; is there any better cinematic space for two men to talk of women and loves-past? &#x96; and we realise why Bunny berated Frank earlier on in the car when he began conversations of a sexual nature. Bunny's issues and patchy relationship with his wife are best explored during a phone call to her; the half painted\/half to be painted stair banister located just behind the figure on the phone stands as an excellent symbolist representation of a relationship that should be leading up (like a banister as it leads you up the stairs), but just feels rocky and half baked. The symbolism here works better than it should, because we've built up a connection of some sort with these people who are, essentially, criminals but bumbling and down-to-earth people caught up in something far meaner.One of the film's other ideas that it sort of touches on here and there is the connection the men make as they undergo their journey. In a fleeting moment that Frank manages to evade his captors, he escapes to another hotel and bathes; but Bunny is equally quick witted and arrives in his room only to physically get into the bath with Frank while fully clothed in what is a scene that takes both Frank and the rest of the audience by total surprise. The earlier gag about Bunny being caught in the past for indecent exposure, which had previously been in the back of our minds, jumps right to the front again as Bunny forces his way into the same 'space' as his goal. I Went Down is a darkly comic, somewhat disturbing at times, but very engrossing film that comes complete with a broad atmosphere and a respectable attitude to some rather intimate ideas. It's a winner.

And nobody seems to want to face it. Only one lone man will stand up for what is right. Everyone else seems much more interested in saving their own hides. This is the setup for a film in which the tension builds and builds as the clock ticks inexorably towards high noon.Our story takes place in a small Western town in the 1800s, in a time and place where everyone expects disputes to be settled with gun battles in the streets. Gary Cooper plays Marshal Will Kane who as we meet him is turning in his badge because he is marrying young pacifist Quaker Amy Fowler. The couple are leaving town and the former marshal will live out his life peacefully running a store with his beautiful young bride. How beautiful? Amy is played, in her first major film role, by one Grace Kelly. Yes, it's good to be Will Kane. But, just as the newlyweds prepare to depart, their happily ever afters are rudely interrupted with the news that ruthless criminal Frank Miller is due to arrive in town on the noon train. After being brought to justice by Kane, Miller had been sentenced to hang. But now he has for some reason been freed and he is coming back to town to take his revenge. Three members of his old gang are waiting for him at the train station. A deadly shootout in the streets seems inevitable. Kane has just over an hour before Miller arrives. What to do? Stand and fight? Or flee? Initially Kane chooses the get out of town approach but inevitably he turns back to face his destiny. He fears Miller would hunt him down but he obviously also feels a sense of duty, a responsibility to protect the innocent people of his quiet town. But when he returns to town Kane is in for a rude awakening. No one in the town is willing to stand and fight with him. As the townspeople continue to reject his pleas for help Kane comes to realize he will have to face Miller's gang alone. And everyone in town, Kane included, knows what that means. Kane's coffin is literally already being built. After years of service, after all he has done for the town, in the moment of truth Kane is abandoned and helplessly alone. It seems the good people of the town are quite willing to sacrifice him to save themselves.This is not your traditional Western. There's a lot of talk and, right up until the very end, very little action. It's a morality play. We know Kane is in the right. And so do the townspeople. But they're not interested in what is right, they're interested in self-preservation. When Kane first returns to the town he figures he'll have plenty of men standing by his side. But as the clock continues to tick, with the film more or less unfolding in real time, despair sets in as Kane realizes he is all but doomed. The tension becomes almost unbearable as we see this good man essentially be led to the slaughter.Cooper is magnificent in his portrayal of this heroic figure. From the joy of his wedding to his despair as noon approaches Kane goes through a wide range of emotions and Cooper captures that beautifully. There are a few moments where Kelly seems a touch unnatural, as if she's forcing things a bit, but her performance is mostly fine. While Kelly inevitably gets most of the attention Katy Jurado does notably fine work in portraying a woman who has her own connection to Kane. Other familiar faces including Lloyd Bridges and Thomas Mitchell also have important roles to play but it's obviously Cooper's film to carry and he is more than up to the task. As for his villainous foil, after so much buildup Frank Miller's ultimate arrival is a little anti-climactic. After hearing so much about him, when you finally see him it's a bit of a letdown. He's just a guy. A mean-looking guy to be sure but just a guy. And when the final showdown occurs it's all over rather quickly and it has a sense of inevitability to it. If you've been paying attention at all the film pretty clearly telegraphs who might have a role to play in deciding Kane's ultimate fate. But all in all it's a terrific, albeit simple, story which captivates throughout. High Noon may not be your typical Western but it's a classic one.

This concentration camp survivor looking like individual goes by the name, no big surprise here, of Harry played by a emaciated looking skin and bones, a body that's perfect in escaping from straight-jackets and handcuffs, Adrien Brody.Together with his partner in crime Greg Handsome Evens, Michael Henderson, Harry kidnaps both Frances Hannon, Laila Robins, and her pet Pooh,played by Duke the Dog, as she was out walking him outside her luxury apartment house one afternoon in Midtown Manhattan. Held for one million dollars in ransom money Harry demands from Frances' millionaire art collector husband Clark, James Naughton, that if he doesn't get the cash by 600 Am the next morning she'll be dead; Dying from suffocation by being buried alive in some unknown location outside the city limits.The movie starts to get really strange when NYPD lady Det. Madeline Maddy Foster, Maura Tierney, is put on the case. With the police and Det. Foster casing out the money drop at the Queens Cemetery, where Harry Houdini just happens to be buried, Harry-the Psycho-leaves himself wide open to be captured by walking right into the trap that the police set for him. After a French Connection style car case thorough the city Harry is finally captured and put into police custody. It's then when we finally realize what exactly Harry's motives in kidnapping Frances, and her pet pooch, really were! They turned out to be just as crazy and unpredictable as he is!We also get to see Det. Foster's dark and secret life as a S&M freak that she's been keeping from her boss in the NYPD as well as husband Capt. Tim Foster, Terry Kinney. This strange and destructive lifestyle is quickly picked up by, who's very obviously into S&M himself, Det. Foster's captive Harry! With that knowledge in mind Harry does everything he can to get under Det. Foster's skin making her job, in finding the buried alive France's Hannon and her Pooch, much harder then it already is.***SPOILER ALERT*** We soon get to find out just that the not all there upstairs Harry really wanted to get himself caught in order to prove that he, like his hero Harry Houdini, can escape from any situation he finds himself in. Like being locked up in a jail cell in a New York City police station! Harry also uses his knowledge of Let. Foster's hang ups, as being into S&M, to cause her to lose her cool by hinting to her hubby Capt. Tim what a crazy freak he's married too. In the end Harry like most nut-cases like himself overplayed his hand in thinking that he's, not the NYPD, in control of what's going on in the movie. That leads to Harry ending up just where he put Frances, in a pine box, with him not worried about suffocating to death because of lack of oxygen because by then he wouldn't really need it anyway!P.S Earlier in the film there's a big chase scenes under the Brooklyn West-End elevated subway line that starts at the 62nd Steet station.

Unquestionably it's probably safe to have low expectations for a film that, by all accounts, even the participants weren't interested in making. But, when we shrug aside the knowledge that this film is wholly unnecessary, Jaws 2 is actually a pretty damn enjoyable movie that certainly doesn't match the original (an impossibility, this), but adds to the story in a way that respectfully honors the spirit of the original. While the two cruddy chapters that follow this one are bottom-feeding tripe, no one involved with Jaws 2 has anything to be ashamed of.In fact, there are moments of intensity here that would nearly match what we saw in the classic original, if we hadn't already seen them in the classic original. The film-makers were savvy enough to utilize the same elements that crafted such sublime suspense the first time, and the sprawling ocean is once again used like a supplemental character. Once we establish that we have another shark on our hands, every panning shot of the murky depths or deceptively calm ocean surface generates genuine tension, and unlike the other films in this franchise, which relied more on close-ups of their clunky monsters than sustained build-up, the straight visual presence of the shark here is saved for moments of true impact, which the film has plenty of.If Roy Schieder wasn't too excited about revisiting Amity Island, you'd certainly never know it from his excellent performance, which is every bit as good as it was the first time out. The quaint island setting, now thriving once again and trying to put its terrible past to rest, is just as well-realized as we remember. And the returning presence of nearly the entire supporting ensemble certainly adds immeasurably. Even the young cast of newcomers deliver strong performances, and nearly everything about the film seems to indicate that just because the film-makers knew they couldn't outdo the original, it wasn't going to be because they didn't try.Scheider's trailer line I know what a shark looks like because I've seen one up close... and you better do something about this shark because I don't intend to go through that hell again supplements a plausible and rational follow-up to the events in the original film, and while he is clearly the protagonist once again, the film is smart enough to note that Chief Brody was never a hero in the first film, just a small town lawman thrown into supernatural and horrifying circumstance. It would have been far too easy, and typical, for Jaws 2 to up the action to compensate for its lack of originality, and while the second half certainly loads up on the shark attacks, we are spared the unrealistic idea of Chief Brody charging into the sea to save his town from terror once again. No, like any normal person who once stared into the black eyes a murderous great white, Brody wants nothing to do with this returning menace, and Schieder's nuanced performance never allows even his bravest deeds to overshadow the fear bubbling inside Brody's stomach.When he finally does step into action, it isn't because he's keen on facing down the beast that continues to haunt his sleepy little township, it's because his two sons (who have aged abnormally quickly in three years, but no matter) are trapped within the tour de force that is the film's second half. After a firmly suspenseful and understated build-up, the frenzied pace of the lengthy climax is a welcome shift, packing as many bits of shark mayhem into 40 minutes as possible. While many will shirk at the idea of our perhaps unreasonably intelligent shark pulling a helicopter down into the sea, even moments like these are handled with utmost care, and they are certainly not as silly as they would have come across in lesser hands.Again, only the familiarity of the carnage dilutes its impact, and seeing Eddie dragged in dreadful fashion across the surface while his girlfriend looks on in helpless horror, we still get the same charge of squeamish delight drawn forward by the ground-breaking effects of the original. By making teenagers the central items on the shark's menu this time out, it's obvious the film has demographics in mind, but Jaws 2 is far too slickly made, well-paced, and splendidly-plotted to be a mere slasher film at sea. As the dwindling survivors drift aimlessly on their decimated water-crafts, their myriad expressions of despair and fright are realistic and relatable, because as we saw with the disparate, quibbling personalities of Quint, Hooper, and Brody in the first film, fear does different things to different people.Perhaps that's the key here. The original Jaws wasn't really about a shark, it was about human beings facing terror beyond imagination. Jaws 2 keeps this point in mind, and while the titular teeth are certainly factored in more prominently this time out, the themes of the original are well-upheld.So, they couldn't top the original. But, in terms of continuing on after an impossible act to follow, this sequel succeeds more admirably than perhaps any other film in its predicament. The very fact that it's not insulting to its audience is a triumph in itself, and considering the abysmal franchise that followed it, Jaws 2 is almost genius in comparison.Give this one another look, and a fair chance, and you'll be pleasantly surprised at what you discover.

The film is very beautiful to look at, and the Buddhist atmosphere is convincing, with a great deal of attention to ritual detail from a Tibetan production adviser. But the film raises many disturbing questions and doubts. I have not read the book, but the consensus of opinion from several reviewers seems to be that this film is highly inaccurate and that many incidents are entirely made up by the screenwriters. However, I am more troubled by the Nazi issue. Heinrich Harrer was a member of the SS, and although he is admitted in some sources to have been a sergeant, he may well really have been a commissioned officer. In the film it is admitted that Harrer was a committed Nazi when he was in Austria, which is very honest, but nothing is mentioned about the SS or that he would therefore have been under SS military orders when he went to Tibet (indeed, he could not have gone in any other capacity, since he was in the SS and had met Hitler). Harrer's internment by the British in India during the War was thus not of an ordinary harmless Austrian mountain climber but of a soldier of the SS, which was a very serious matter in wartime, and the film glosses over this entirely. Instead, Harrer is made to appear an unjustly imprisoned man, which is very far from the truth. Few viewers of this film can possibly be expected to know of the Nazi obsession with Tibet or the reasons for it. Nor is the depiction of Tibetan Buddhism as a wholly good institution accurate. The true facts are very different. There were thousands of monasteries in Tibet and some contained 'good guys' and some contained 'bad guys', to put it in its simplest terms. There were sects of Tibetan monks, doubtless a small minority, who were 'on the left hand path' and involved in black magic. They were sometimes called 'the Yellow Hats' by the Nazis. People like the Dalai Lama, who hate things like black magic and believe in love and gentleness, were strongly opposed to them. In other words, Tibetan Buddhism was anything but uniform, it was diverse. Hundreds of 'Yellow Hat' lamas went to Germany during the 1930s and 1940s, and three hundred of them committed ritual suicide in Berlin just as the Russians were invading the City at the end of the War, and their bodies were found all lying in rows not far from Hitler's bunker. These 'evil lamas' were in league with Hitler, and were controlled through the SS, of which Harrer was a member. It was their 'job' to use their spiritual black magic powers to help the Nazis win the War, and Hitler became annoyed with them at the end because he believed they had failed him and that their mystical powers had been ineffective. The Nazis believed all kinds of crazy things, and the SS was the occult core of the Nazi movement, with its head, Heinrich Himmler, being totally obsessed by such matters, including his Tibetan lamas. Among the bizarre beliefs of the Nazis was that there were 'secret chiefs', hidden spirits of gigantic, super-human size, in command of the dark forces, who resided in deep caves beneath the Himalayas. The Nazis sent various expeditions to Tibet in the 1930s, and some of them were received in Lhasa, or at other places which were friendlier than Lhasa. So it seems that Harrer was somewhat less than candid in what he revealed about this, and that the film in turn is even more obfuscating on the issue. Probably it is true that Harrer really did reject his Nazi past after his years in Tibet, but although admitting to a Nazi past to a certain extent, there was no advantage to him, and indeed there was considerable personal danger, in giving any fuller details. After all, his former colleagues would certainly have taken reprisals against him if he had told the true full story about SS penetration of Tibet. It was acknowledged at the top of the Nazi leadership by such occult fanatics as Himmler and Hess that Hitler was being inspired, perhaps even manipulated, by the primaeval 'dark powers' who resided beneath the mountains of Tibet and who would grant the Nazis dominion over the whole earth if they received enough blood sacrifices. The real reason why millions of people were killed in the gas chambers, by no means all of whom were Jews, was not a simplistic anti-Semitism at all (though that was put about for mass consumption, and the anti-Semitism was real enough), but was as a black magic 'blood sacrifice' to the 'dark powers' in Tibet. Hitler and Himmler believed that if they fed the evil spirits inhabiting the caverns beneath Tibet with the souls of millions of humans, the evil spirits would then grant them rule over the earth as their representatives, and at the same time they would be 'making a New Man' of pure Aryan blood. The SS leadership celebrated black masses and many strange sexual rituals and performed human sacrifices. Himmler was the Grand Master and he and his twelve chief subordinate initiates actually worshiped Satan at Schloss Wewelsburg. Concealing the truth about Harrer's original SS membership does no one any good. Indeed, the contrast between Harrer's true SS past, as opposed to the sanitized version of it which says he was merely a Nazi sympathizer, and his later attitudes does him far more credit than he has ever received. Maybe we should look at it that way, and not be too starry-eyed about Germans in Tibet in the 1930s.

The real reason why millions of people were killed in the gas chambers, by no means all of whom were Jews, was not a simplistic anti-Semitism at all (though that was put about for mass consumption, and the anti-Semitism was real enough), but was as a black magic 'blood sacrifice' to the 'dark powers' in Tibet. Hitler and Himmler believed that if they fed the evil spirits inhabiting the caverns beneath Tibet with the souls of millions of humans, the evil spirits would then grant them rule over the earth as their representatives, and at the same time they would be 'making a New Man' of pure Aryan blood. The SS leadership celebrated black masses and many strange sexual rituals and performed human sacrifices. Himmler was the Grand Master and he and his twelve chief subordinate initiates actually worshiped Satan at Schloss Wewelsburg. Concealing the truth about Harrer's original SS membership does no one any good. Indeed, the contrast between Harrer's true SS past, as opposed to the sanitized version of it which says he was merely a Nazi sympathizer, and his later attitudes does him far more credit than he has ever received. Maybe we should look at it that way, and not be too starry-eyed about Germans in Tibet in the 1930s.

Not only are you attempting to recreate the same symbolic references and deep moral elements of an already established cult classic, but there are so many other outside elements that may be harder to control than simply samurai's saving a small village. None the less, director John Sturges tried, and the final result was the abysmal The Magnificent Seven. Not to plot my course to early, but being a large fan of Kurosawa's masterpiece, I had to put that aside and see this film for what it was &#x96; what Sturges envisioned &#x96; instead of just making comparison after comparison. With sloppy characters, lacking detail, American-ized natives, and a grossly unoriginal villain &#x96; this 1960 classic is only memorable for a couple of key performances and an energetic score. Outside of that, Sturges uttered blasphemy on Kurosawa's work.Again, I said I wouldn't compare the two works &#x96; so every attempt will be made not to. There were high hopes for The Magnificent Seven, a family favorite film that has somehow slipped through my viewing time, but the moment this film began my attention began to fade. With a weak opening, and a lackluster retrieval of heroes to protect the village, The Magnificent Seven came out of the gates with a mere gallop, and eventually didn't even finish the race. As mentioned, our villain has these long monologues of corruption and greed, but when it comes down to it, Calvera didn't have the true evil gene. He was corrupt, but it was only skin deep. Outside of the typical ransacking of small villages, his character demonstrated no true evil &#x96; albeit with a PG rating, what could he do &#x96; but I don't believe Calvera could strike fear in any child today. Eli Wallach is to blame for this. Yet, he wasn't the only one dragging his feet. This film was bombarded by lackluster acting. Yul Brynner, the obvious lead, seemed to sputter his lines without a moment of emotion or spirit. His pathetic portrayal of Chris Adams, the main cowboy hired to protect, fell flat and was boring to the average viewer. That same description could also be used for most of those that he recruited (what is the saying, flies attract flies?), sans Steve McQueen. As a fan of McQueen's work, I was impressed by the way he picked up the lacking flag of the others. While he didn't provide much to each scene, he was interesting to watch, obviously caring more about the overall performance than Brynner did. Unlike Kurosawa's epic, this didn't focus as much on the men of the mission, just that they could be there to attack whoever descended onto the village. There was no individual character development, and when there was (see Robert Vaughn's nightmare) it was rushed and ill-focused. Whereas in Samurai we felt something for each of the heroes, in this &#x96; nobody seemed to have the courage to stand forward and introduce themselves to us.I must admit &#x96; this film was boring. From the introduction, to the recruiting, all the way to the repeat battle &#x96; The Magnificent Seven provided little-to-no entertainment. With no character to stand behind, it was left up to the action to drive the focus, but alas, this seemed to fall short as well. I can agree that there were some decent moments that spoke for the western genre, but nothing challenging. Evil riders would ride in, gunshots would smoke, people would fall, and finally there would be celebration. Thinking about it now, it felt as if Sturges was providing us a cheapened Cliff-Notes version of the original tale. With a running time of a mere 128 minutes, there is no way you could capture the intensity and drama behind Kurosawa's original 203 minute epic. Again, not to compare side by side &#x96; but what made the original work was the characters, the story, the intensity that Kurosawa was able to push through your television set. The Magnificent Seven felt like a rushed Hollywood project that had big stars, but no heart.Overall, I really wanted to like this film. The cast itself sells this movie, but as a viewer of cinema, it just seemed like a poorly constructed feature. Hollywood was attempting to make a dime on Kurosawa's original idea, and it failed. I cannot watch this movie again, nor would I. The acting is atrocious, the story is choppy, and there was no real threat. The idea that these villagers could survive year after year of this attack forced me to believe that perhaps Calvera wasn't robbing them blind. We weren't given enough history of the violence prior to the introduction of our heroes.

This is not your average thriller because not only does it try and frighten, but it also raises incredibly powerful psychological questions about the influence of God and whether God should or should not have such a powerful effect on a normal family man.That family man is played by Paxton as a hard-working, caring, and widowed father of two boys, Fenton (Matt O'Leary) and Adam (Jeremy Sumpter). The family has a normal daily routine that it follows for a while until one night when Paxton suddenly wakes up his children in the middle of the night. He tells the boys that he has received a message from God that says he needs to seek out and destroy demons. The names of these demons will be provided to him by a sort of guardian angel, and then he must destroy them, not kill them. Yes, it is a somewhat outrageous subject matter, but that is also what makes it so frightening because it makes us wonder if people outside of the movies feel these types of influences.The movie starts with an older Fenton, played by Matthew McConaughey, walking into a police station one night and informing an agent (Powers Boothe) that the God's Hand killer is his brother, Adam. After this point, the movie goes into flashback mode with Paxton, O'Leary, and Sumpter occupying the screen for most of the movie. Paxton gives a strong performance as a desperate father who really isn't a bad guy; he just believes the visions he is having and the messages he's receiving. Who are we to say that he is a bad man? If an honest man truly believes he is doing God's work, does that make him crazy, or does it make God crazy? These are some of the overriding questions that the film asks and they will certainly keep you thinking after the credits roll.Paxton shows here that he is definitely a versatile talent with some real directorial skill. He has only directed one other film since Frailty but hopefully he plans to add more to his résumé in the not-so- distant future. It would be a shame for this film to be his sole achievement in the director's chair because it feels like there really is something genuine in his storytelling.Perhaps the most surprising element of this film is the performances that Paxton gets out of his two child stars, Matt O'Leary and Jeremy Sumpter. They have a lot screen time in this film and if they weren't up to the task, the whole film could've fallen apart. There is also credit due to Bill Paxton because he truly creates such an original film in the genre. It is violent and scary without being gory and it is thought- provoking without being preachy to the audience.I was completely astounded at how good this film is, and I think most audiences will be too. It was only made for $11 million even though it features some recognizable actors, and it just barely earned more than its budget at the box office. However, as this movie ages, I'm sure that it will grow in terms of its fan base. It is a film that makes all the other ones similar to it pale in comparison.

A story of a Frail young woman, Bess, in a tiny Scottish community, who marries an outsider, swede Jan. Jan works offshore on the rigs, and whilst away, has a terrible accident that will change his and Bess' relationship forever. That is the very briefest outline of the movie - but suffice to say that outline does as much for describing this movie as taking a hoover to an earthquake. Whenever i review movies i usually just write them off the cuff, my thoughts and feelings about how it made me feel, and indeed afterwards, as with this particular one its sticking with me hard, and I'm still struggling how to describe it. Bess is a virgin when she and Jan meet - the community she lives in the church dominates all - and Bess, a lonely, slightly unstable childlike woman is thrown into a world with Jan unlike anything she has seen before - she cries profusely when he has to return to his rig, screams in agony and cannot bear to be apart from him at all, not for any length of time. The love that she feels for Jan - and he her - is the basis of the movie, but i hesitate to describe this as just a love story, sure its the basis for the actions of the characters, but there are so many themes here (that i will try and cover) that it will stick in your mind, as you replay it over and over. Jan returns to his rig, and Bess agonises without him... praying every day for his return, which she gets, as Jan is crippled in an accident that sends him back to Bess. As I've stated, some of the many themes explored in the movie, along with a quite astonishing performance by Emily Watson as Bess raise it way above the average. But by the end, i couldn't help but feel id just watched arguably one of the greatest films ever made, a feeling that is still lingering. So Jan is crippled, and unable to fend for himself at all. Jan is also unable to make love to his wife either, and persuades Bess to take another lover in order that she can tell him of her experiences, and he might still 'live', as lovemaking with his wife is what keeps him alive. So Bess, initially, is filled with horror at the thought of being with anybody else, but comes to realise that Jan will live if she can sexually satisfy him, and that becomes her aim. The extraordinary tale of love is intermingled with a very difficult notion of sexual redemption - the theme is one of obvious debate amongst many, but the wondrous side of it is there is no right and wrong - Bess's sister in law and her doctor, her mother, church and community ostracise her, label her a tart and cannot disguise their disgust at her actions. But one of the messages that Von Trier is allaying is how much can you love somebody before you go to that length? how many us know what we would do? these themes in particular roused great passions in me, because i don't have the answers. if i loved somebody that much would i do whatever it took to please them? Bess's final actions may not be redemptive, what she does is her ultimate act of love, and the scenes at the end truly are heart breaking. Shot in a unique, amateur camera style that is necessary for the element of realism, as with all of the greatest movies, you actually forget your on a sofa watching. your there, with them, feeling the emotions they feel, and putting yourself in their shoes.

But by the end, i couldn't help but feel id just watched arguably one of the greatest films ever made, a feeling that is still lingering. So Jan is crippled, and unable to fend for himself at all. Jan is also unable to make love to his wife either, and persuades Bess to take another lover in order that she can tell him of her experiences, and he might still 'live', as lovemaking with his wife is what keeps him alive. So Bess, initially, is filled with horror at the thought of being with anybody else, but comes to realise that Jan will live if she can sexually satisfy him, and that becomes her aim. The extraordinary tale of love is intermingled with a very difficult notion of sexual redemption - the theme is one of obvious debate amongst many, but the wondrous side of it is there is no right and wrong - Bess's sister in law and her doctor, her mother, church and community ostracise her, label her a tart and cannot disguise their disgust at her actions. But one of the messages that Von Trier is allaying is how much can you love somebody before you go to that length? how many us know what we would do? these themes in particular roused great passions in me, because i don't have the answers. if i loved somebody that much would i do whatever it took to please them? Bess's final actions may not be redemptive, what she does is her ultimate act of love, and the scenes at the end truly are heart breaking. Shot in a unique, amateur camera style that is necessary for the element of realism, as with all of the greatest movies, you actually forget your on a sofa watching. your there, with them, feeling the emotions they feel, and putting yourself in their shoes. 'Breaking the waves', truly a movie experience like no other.

This Bruce Willis & Richard Gere assassination saga ranks as a pallid remake of director Fred Zinnemann's classic 1973 thriller The Day of the Jackal. Typically, Hollywood remakes are inferior when compared with the original, and The Jackal indisputably proves the point beyond a shadow of a doubt. Sluggishly paced, abysmally written, and hilariously performed, The Jackal has managed nevertheless to sucker large audiences into cinemas, based undoubtedly on its stellar cast, rather than its narrative.The Jackal draws its inspiration from scenarist Kenneth Ross's Day of the Jackal script. No screen reference appears in the opening film credits for novelist Frederick Forsyth who penned the international bestseller about a lone assassin gunning for French president Charles de Gaulle. Whereas the original Jackal took place in the 1960s, the Jackal remake unfolds in a contemporary setting. What made the original Jackal a tense, spellbinding, but imaginative actioneers was how the filmmakers got around their obvious dead end ending. Everybody knew that De Gaulle was never shot down by an assassin, so Zinnemann and his write Kenneth Ross had to dream up a plausible resolution. They did. Memphis Belle director Michael Caton-Jones and scenarist Chuck Pfarrer, however, come up with nothing to match the original's clever conclusion.That's not to say that The Jackal isn't an elegant looking epic with some interesting high-tech firearms. The movie makers have spared no expense in rehashing the original. The story globe trots from the new Moscow to Helsinki, then London, England, and finally the United States. The problem is that director Caton-Jones and scenarist Pfarrer have eliminated the best parts of Ross' original script and replaced them with their own brain-dead plotting. When the characters in The Jackal aren't acting like imbeciles, the people who made the film are.FBI Deputy Director Carter Preston (Sidney Poitier) storms into a Moscow disco on the heels of Russian Intelligence officer Major Valentina Koslova (Diane Venora of Wolfen) and her policemen to bust arrogant Russian mafioso Ghazzi Murad (Ravil Isyanov of GoldenEye). When he cannot bribe Koslova, Ghazzi whips out a knife. During the ensuing struggle, Koslova shoots Ghazzi at close range and kills him. Terek Murad (David Hayman of Walker) is furious when he learns about Ghazzi's death. Terek is so upset that he buries an axe in the head of the mafia soldier who brought him the bad news.The vindictive Terek hires a lethal assassin known only as The Jackal. Demanding bloody retribution, Terek pays the Jackal the sum of $70-million dollars, half in advance and the other half on completion of the killing. Specifically, Terek demands the head of the FBI killed in spectacular fashion. The Jackal orders Terek to hole up somewhere outside of Russia until he has iced the FBI chief. Meanwhile, Russia authorities abduct one of Terek's bodyguards.Under gruesome torture the bodyguard yields the word 'jackal.' Koslova informs an incredulous Preston that the KGB once used the Jackal's services. Moreover, they learn that somebody is alive who can positively identify the Jackal. The catch is that the FBI doesn't know where they can lay their hands on Isabella (Mathilda May of Lifeforce). The best that they can come up with is her old flame, IRA terrorist Declan Mulqueen (Richard Gere of Internal Affairs), who is pulling a 50-year stretch in a Massachusetts lock-up on a weapons charge.Reluctant initially to reveal the whereabouts of his ex-girlfriend, Mulqueen decides to help the FBI. Not only does he tell Preston that he has seen the Jackal, but also that he can recognize the Jackal's methods. Caton-Jones and Pfarrer cross-cut between the authorities tracking down the Jackal and the Jackal's painstaking efforts to elude capture and devise a failsafe scenario so he can get away without a trace. As the tight-lipped, amoral, icy-hearted eponymous character, Bruce Willis turns in a Dr. Jackal and Mr. Hide performance. Willis' hit-man travels incognito with several identities and passports to get him through customs anywhere he goes. Talk about dressing up. Half of The Jackal is wasted as we try to spot Bruno in his next outlandish disguise. Willis has more fun dressing up than shooting people. None of Willis' disguises are as ingenious or playful as the ones Val Kilmer wore in The Saint. Now, you Die Hard fans are going to be disappointed with The Jackal. One of Bruno's disguises is playing a homosexual, and we get to see Bruno kiss another homosexual. No, you don't see their lips smack! Willis and the filmmakers photograph the kissing scene tastefully so that you cannot actually see Bruce's lips on the other fellow's mouth.Although Willis makes a tolerable villain, he is supposed to be the deadliest hit-man in the world. Truth of the matter is that the guy cannot hit the side of a barn with his pistol. In an early shoot-out with Valentina, the Jackal misses practically every shot! Later, in a subway gunfight with Mulqueen, the Jackal incredibly cannot put a bullet in the ex-IRA gunman! Here's the Jackal behind a pillar swapping lead with Mulqueen who is standing out in the open without a bit of cover, and the Jackal cannot hit him! Which brings me to the Jackal's sophisticated Gatling gun weapon. Does he want to make the shoot-out a bloody one with a weapon that can empty its clip of ammunition before the first shot tears into its target? Or is it simply that the Jackal is a pathetic marksman? Richard Gere looks hopelessly miscast as an honorable IRA gunman. His emerald accent is acceptable, largely because he doesn't have to utter a lot of singsong dialogue.

As usual, mainstream ruled with such bores as A Nightmare On Elm Street. Then, you got your standard B-Horror, with greatness like Basket Case. And even the amateurs got in on the fun, with shot-on-video atrocities like Horror House On Highway 5, yeah, Z-Horror The point is, there's a hell of a lot of 80's horror out there, probably too much, but one in particular has always stuck out in my mind. Sleepaway Camp is a bit different than other Camp-Slashers from that era. Sure, it takes place at a typical camp, with typical kids getting into typical trouble. Sure, there is a killer, and yes, everything seems really predictable, and to an extent, it is, but you don't know, if you haven't seen this, you just don't know. There are bad things going on at Camp Arawak, and who is doing this is not what makes Sleepaway Camp so Earth-shattering, it's why.

To commemorate the anniversary (and to show off the hospital's own special brand of art therapy) a group of inmates at Charenton Asylum perform a play recreating Marat's last days, written and directed by the infamous Marquis de Sade. The players include a recovering paranoiac, a narcoleptic also suffering from melancholia, a sex maniac, a former priest, a former prostitute, and a patient so incensed by his role that he is confined to a straight-jacket the entire time. As the play progresses, delving into the political and social unrest of the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror, the players discuss and debate the purpose of revolution, the horrors of war, the futility of activism, the need for equality, the impossibility of equality, the desire for freedom, the importance of individuality, and the relationship between murder and sexual passion. To start with.Oh, and it's a musical too.This is a great movie. One of the most intellectually challenging and rewarding movies I've ever seen. Directed by Peter Brook and performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company, it's a filmed version of Peter Weiss' play of the same name. It demands a lot of a viewer. Once it starts, it doesn't give you much room to breathe. It just takes off running and you are forced to keep up with it. It's one of the few movies I've ever seen where I was agreeing and disagreeing with every main character at various points. It's almost too much to take in in one sitting. I've seen it several times and I still feel like there's more to get out of it. I knew next to nothing about the French Revolution going in, but I still felt like I understood the issues at hand. They can just as easily apply to modern American society.The acting is uniformly excellent. The three main players--Patrick Magee (de Sade), Ian Richardson (Marat), and Glenda Jackson (Corday)--are all outstanding. Magee brings a unique humanity to a man largely considered by history to be a savage pervert. Richardson's Marat is heartbreaking. Endlessly staring ahead, he knows his cause is probably lost but can't give up on it. Jackson is stunning as both the impassioned Corday and the patient desperately trying to spit out her lines before she falls asleep again. There isn't a note out of place in the whole cast. What I can't get over is that these actors had already performed these roles on stage umpteen times before they made the film. That they performed such a challenging play night after night with the same kind of talent, intensity and passion you see on the screen is remarkable.Marat\/Sade is definitely a polarizing film. I wasn't sure I liked it until the second time I watched it. But I couldn't stop thinking about it after the first. It's disturbing, frightening, funny and demanding (sometimes all at the same time), but in my opinion, it's worth seeing at least once.

Now I'm usually not to fond of movies in the horror genre, but this was excellent! It's a movie based on Paranoia, the fear for the unknown, and the ultimate fight for survival.The basic plot is that a team of scientist stationed on Antarctica comes across a helicopter with two frantic Norwgians trying for some reason to kill a dog. The team saves the dog and kills the two Norwgians in self defence. Meanwhile they discover that everyone at the Norwegians base, has either died of unknown reasons or killed each other. They had also found a hundred-thousand year old spacecraft in the snow, and apparently dug something up, which was now gone. Later during the night the dog changes into something hideous and grotesque, they kill it, but that's not the end of it. They soon realize that there's an alien that can infest they're bodies and slowly grow inside them, and any one of the the team that has been in contact with the dog, could be the Thing.Im not going to spoil anymore, and i advise you to see this movie, but I warn you this is not for the weak of heart.The effects were excellent, and prove that you don't need CGI to make a good movie monster. The Thing looked so real, and I tell you, CGI would just have made it look fake. And I'll give the man behind the special effects, Rob Bottin ten points just for the Thing. The acting in the movie must not be forgotten either, Kurt Russel as McReady was excellent and couldn't been done better. The fear he and the rest of the crew projected just helped make the film even more horrifying. And lets not forget, this movie proves John Carpenters great skills as a movie maker.So two thumbs up, and I recommend this film for everyone that is a Horror, Sci-fi, or simply a John Carpenter or Kurt Russel fan.

The problem remains that many of these true stories may have happened with a few bunch of people or to a minuscule portion of the society.And the rapid changes conditioned upon this society that such touching incidents are veiled and have to wait for the eventuality of a writer like Oliver sacks to bring it back to life through his book of the same name.Here is a movie of belief and hope that will lift your spirits no matter what you have experienced in life.I was in tears as i watched how unfair life can be.Robin Williams has portrayed Dr.Sayer with true conviction, and Deniro's performance is commendable.Penny Marshall has done a tremendous job directing this Drama.I strongly recommend this to everyone.Mukarram.Dhorajiwala ","genre":null},{"date":"18 August 2009","score":"8 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" After watching this movie i can't stop thinking that there are so many untold true and moving stories which can really impact your perspective towards life.

I thought I'd seen all the great films of my lifetime. How did this one slip through the net? The script, the acting and the direction set a benchmark. I can't really add to the praise of others, except to say that, apart from the 80s haircuts and outfits, this film hasn't dated at all. It's still superb, even thirty years on. What makes it special are the characterisations - all of them. No-one is completely blameless, or completely at fault, and even the minor characters have a depth and breadth to them that you don't see very often. Just an excellent film. Go see it.
