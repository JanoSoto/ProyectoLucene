The IMDb averaged rating is not merely a little wrong, it is crazy wrong. This is one of the most coherent martial arts films ever done. It stars Jet Li. Legendary wildman Luc Besson is behind the typewriter. The under-utilized Bridget Fonda single-handedly carries the female portion of the film, and does a great job. Several of the fight scenes are as carefully conceived and choreographed as anything Bruce Lee ever attempted. (See the twins scene). 2. The script works, I mean it REALLY works. The idea of a lone agent from China seems a bit stretched, until you realize that, if China were to send a lone gun, it would likely be Jet Li. The double-cross works because, you figure, if anyone understands French cops, it would be Besson. The kidnapping works. The fight scene with the pool balls works. The bickering between Li and Fonda at the noodle shop works. The acupuncture angle works. The ending is fantastic. Do you see where this is going? The hallmark of a really good film is that you can watch it from beginning to end and remain engaged. This story delivers. 3.

This review is probably less about the actual quality of this movie and more about how it makes me feel because I grew up with Ernest like many of us did. I probably watched Ernest Goes To Camp and this film a thousand times at least, not to mention his Saturday morning TV Series. It has been years since I watched any of Ernest's antics and decided to check out the old Christmas classic this year. What a terrific movie for families and what a talent Jim Varney was. Ernest (in general and in this movie) is so ridiculous, campy, cheesy and its just the perfect blend of all of that with a healthy dose of true comedy. The movie is cute and fun full of adventure and magic and holiday spirit. It isn't sappy but if you look under the surface there really is a sweet story there and has several different characters going through different things throughout the film. For what some might call a silly comedy, it is actually smartly written. It knows exactly its demographic and most importantly it knows what fans of Ernest want to see. It is a Christmas movie at its heart and soul and yet doesn't forget to include everything you love about Ernest and his adventures.I forgot just how amazing Jim Varney was in this role. His physical comedy is really something to see, whether he's pretending to be a silly character (snake farmer, old lady etc) or he's on a rant through Vern's house or trying to save a Christmas tree from the highway. He's simple and yet brilliant and full of heart. Its a great character and I forgot just how much I liked him. Ernest is the perfect character to put into a Christmas film and no one could do it like Varney. Not to be outdone the supporting cast is so good in their roles. Douglas Seale is amazing as Santa who is ready to retire and looking for his replacement. He is so out of place in the fast paced world but a strong person who is being treated so poorly. The chemistry with him and Varney is perfect for the film. Oliver Clark is the Mister Rogers type TV personality that Santa wants to replace him. Clark is good, although a little toned down compared to some of the other performances in the film. He is still very good in the movie. One of the first crushes I remember having was on Noelle Parker's Harmony. She is a wayward kid that lies and steals and happens to come across Ernest and Santa and learns the errors of her ways. She is the perfect personification of an 80's kid with the side pony and the clothes she wears. She nails the role and while its a very cookie cutter role, she is does it well (and she's as cute as she was back then.) Ernest regulars Bill Byrge and Robert Lesser show up as Bobby and Marty in a silly little side story that happens to be hilarious.I just don't know how anyone can't like this movie. I mean it isn't an Oscar winner and if you're looking for raunchy comedy you won't find it anywhere here at all. This is a clean cut family film with some really smart comedy and brilliantly they made sure John Cherry (who is an Ernest director staple) direct this one. He has done Ernest films and TV Shows since its conception it would seem and so he knows the character and likely worked well with Varney. If you're going into this with the right expectations you can't possibly be disappointed. If you don't know anything about Ernest or you're expecting some modern day raunch comedy then you'll hate this. This has everything you could possibly want from a comedy like this.

One is about a forbidden love aboard a doomed ship. The other is about humans trying to exploit an alien race in order to profit. Yet both have something very similar in common they are criticized for having unoriginal stories.Titanic is a love story about a doomed couple. People complain that it's been done before (Romeo and Juliet) and that it's boring. They only enjoy the second half which consists of everyone dying. I'm here to say that is an unfair call.THE GOODThere's nothing wrong with an unoriginal story, as long as the execution is good. After all, we're running out of original stories. Even Shakespeare had a tendency to take other people's stories. He just told them really well. So, is Titanic well executed? yes, on the most part. While it does have it's flaws, I think the bulk of the film is amazing.

The main thing to understand is that the film is basically two movies in one. There is almost literally a split in the middle of the movie, effectively separating the first half from the second half.The first half of the film is a quaint, heartwarming depiction of the origins of Santa Claus and his wife Anya- how they came to the North Pole, fulfilling an ancient prophecy from the elves, and various origins of famous Christmas associations (such as the boy who prompted Santa to start the Naughty and Nice list).The second half of the film all but ignores Santa and heartwarming feelings and becomes a zany slapstick comedy involving one of the elves (Dudley Moore) and his dealings with a dastardly businessman (John Lithgow) who schemes to take over Christmas.The curious aspect of a feature film with two distinct parts to it might be slightly jarring to the viewer, especially since both halves of the movie differ so much in tone. If you think of it, however, as like watching two different episodes of a television show, it might help to ease the feeling of unevenness.In short, this is a movie where the ingredients are more entertaining than the actual plot. David Huddleston and Judy Cornwell are very nice as the traditional Mr. and Mrs. Claus, and the North Pole toy shop is how you always imagined Santa's workshop to be. Wonderful John Lithgow is completely hilarious as the comically villainous B.Z., and he pretty much steals the show in the second half of the film. But many questions about Santa Claus are neatly answered in this movie (such as how the reindeer fly and how Santa is able to fly around the whole world in just one night).It's a Christmas movie that both works and doesn't work, but there are many ingredients- the cozy Christmas feel of the first part and the zany comedy of the second- that make for satisfying holiday viewing, and might enhance a Christmas movie collection, as long as you just sit back and let the ingredients of the film carry you through.

It should PG or PG-13, as this 89 minutes Christmas movie has a robbery, kidnapping, car crash, extreme child endangerment, and a murder. It's no way, should be Rated G. It's actually quite a dreary, downbeat and sad film for the most part, with realistic and mundane look of life. Nothing in the film directed by Phillip Borsos stands out as lively. The clothing is dreary. The locations are cold, and dark. The characters, plot, and nearly everything in production design looks bleak. While, the movie did have a good cast, the story didn't had that golly feeling needed to make this watchable. One Magic Christmas is starts out grim, already as it's about a mother Ginny Grainger (Mary Steenburgen), whom husband, Jack (Gary Basaraba) is out of work, and the family is near being homeless as they are force to move out of the company house before the end of the year. Jack has a big dream of opening a bike shop of his own, but it would eat up their savings, which Ginny sees as a foolish move. I hate how the movie makes Ginny look like Scrooge, because she loses sight of the true meaning of Christmas. Great symbolism like when all the Christmas lights begin turning off all around her, as to show that the last of the Christmas spirit has been drained from her after a fight with Jack, but it was a bit cruel. I'm sorry, but if you can't make ends meet, you have to cut down. She is already working as a cashier in the grocery store. She also raising their children; Abbie (Elisabeth Harnois), Caleb (Arthur Hill) and Cal (Robbie Magwood); so she is no way a Grinch like character. So the responsible mom is the bad guy here, while the happy- go-lucky, spendthrift Dad, so full of good cheer, is the hero. What? Christmas get worst for them, as a series of near accidents seem to follow. First off, Abbie nearly get run over by a car while sending a letter to Santa at her mailbox, but a guardian angel name Gideon (Harry Dean Stanton) save her. The next day, Christmas Eve, Ginny get fired from her job due to her trying to take care of her children, and also against her wishes, Jack goes to the bank to take some money out of their savings to do some Christmas shopping for the kids. A bank robber enters the bank and accidentally shot Jack during the heist. He then flees the bank and hops into the family's car with Abbie and Cal still inside. Ginny realizes that the gunman just stole the car with the children in it, chases after him, only to find out that the car has swerve off the bridge into a river below with her children. I know about Murphy's Law, but this movie makes it look like it's like God is trying to go Job on her like a Final Destination style with its silly everything that can go wrong, could, gimmick. It was a bit too much for dramatic effect. After learning of the death of both her husband and children, Ginny returns home to an empty house, spirit broken, and weeps. Are you sure, producers that this is a Christmas movie?! Anyways, Ginny find out that Gideon save the children before the crash, but couldn't save the Dad. The reasons why, he couldn't save him is BS, in my opinion. Gideon tells the children, that only Santa Claus (Jan Rubes) can bring him back alive which end up being a lie, too. The only way to save Jack is for Abbie's mother to have her spirit of Christmas back in which the kids try with a Christmas letter. Will Ginny get her Christmas spirit back or will Jack be gone forever? Watch the movie for the rest. The ending is a cop out, anyways. Remember children, if somebody dies, it's because your parent doesn't believe in the Christmas spirit; it wasn't the thing that killed them! Plus, if you ever want them back from the dead, just ask Santa is raised them from the grave like zombies. He already use zombies to work his workshop rather than elves, anyways. The bank robber left his son at the bus station; he never mentioned again, will he get his father back if he believed in Santa? NO! What a horrible message. The movie should be telling children how to overcome tragedy; because in real life, you can't change past events. This would make a better message then the one, we get in this film. The acting in the film is pretty alright. Mary Steenburgen is very emotionally subdued throughout the film. Her character walks around in a daze, enjoying little of life. She is a great actress. Harry Dean Stanton is a fine actor but his character looked like a child killer than an angel. It didn't help that he was in a long trench coat, and dark hat spying on them on top of trees. He look and act like a craze stalker. Sadly, Guardian angel Gideon shares many characteristics with child molesters and pretty much a bad role model. One thing about the movie is its pacing. It's boring at times. Overall The message means well, but the plot is too dark for a Christmas movie. Ugh, Stay away from this one, if you have young children. It's worth viewing with a more mature audience.

It should PG or PG-13, as this 89 minutes Christmas movie has a robbery, kidnapping, car crash, extreme child endangerment, and a murder. It's no way, should be Rated G. It's actually quite a dreary, downbeat and sad film for the most part, with realistic and mundane look of life. Nothing in the film directed by Phillip Borsos stands out as lively. The clothing is dreary. The locations are cold, and dark. The characters, plot, and nearly everything in production design looks bleak. While, the movie did have a good cast, the story didn't had that golly feeling needed to make this watchable. One Magic Christmas is starts out grim, already as it's about a mother Ginny Grainger (Mary Steenburgen), whom husband, Jack (Gary Basaraba) is out of work, and the family is near being homeless as they are force to move out of the company house before the end of the year. Jack has a big dream of opening a bike shop of his own, but it would eat up their savings, which Ginny sees as a foolish move. I hate how the movie makes Ginny look like Scrooge, because she loses sight of the true meaning of Christmas. Great symbolism like when all the Christmas lights begin turning off all around her, as to show that the last of the Christmas spirit has been drained from her after a fight with Jack, but it was a bit cruel. I'm sorry, but if you can't make ends meet, you have to cut down. She is already working as a cashier in the grocery store. She also raising their children; Abbie (Elisabeth Harnois), Caleb (Arthur Hill) and Cal (Robbie Magwood); so she is no way a Grinch like character. So the responsible mom is the bad guy here, while the happy- go-lucky, spendthrift Dad, so full of good cheer, is the hero. What? Christmas get worst for them, as a series of near accidents seem to follow. First off, Abbie nearly get run over by a car while sending a letter to Santa at her mailbox, but a guardian angel name Gideon (Harry Dean Stanton) save her. The next day, Christmas Eve, Ginny get fired from her job due to her trying to take care of her children, and also against her wishes, Jack goes to the bank to take some money out of their savings to do some Christmas shopping for the kids. A bank robber enters the bank and accidentally shot Jack during the heist. He then flees the bank and hops into the family's car with Abbie and Cal still inside. Ginny realizes that the gunman just stole the car with the children in it, chases after him, only to find out that the car has swerve off the bridge into a river below with her children. I know about Murphy's Law, but this movie makes it look like it's like God is trying to go Job on her like a Final Destination style with its silly everything that can go wrong, could, gimmick. It was a bit too much for dramatic effect. After learning of the death of both her husband and children, Ginny returns home to an empty house, spirit broken, and weeps. Are you sure, producers that this is a Christmas movie?! Anyways, Ginny find out that Gideon save the children before the crash, but couldn't save the Dad. The reasons why, he couldn't save him is BS, in my opinion. Gideon tells the children, that only Santa Claus (Jan Rubes) can bring him back alive which end up being a lie, too. The only way to save Jack is for Abbie's mother to have her spirit of Christmas back in which the kids try with a Christmas letter. Will Ginny get her Christmas spirit back or will Jack be gone forever? Watch the movie for the rest. The ending is a cop out, anyways.

Unlike most modern thrillers, as you analyze the action of this one ever more closely, after seeing it many times, it fits like an ever more perfect puzzle. Excellent plotting, acting and ever more stupendous Edith Head costumes equals an outstanding film.As always with Hitchcock, the audience is privy to all the former cat burglar John Robbie knows the moment he learns it. The excitement is never milked by lamely hiding knowledge from the viewer. And once one knows whodunit after the first viewing, the fun is to pick up on the more subtle clues and imagine yourself in Robie's mind.The movie assumes an intelligent audience. For example, at the end of a chase in a flower market where the police catches Robie, Hitchcock does not bother to show you the boring arrest and cross examination; rather it becomes a phrase in passing from the Lloyd's insurance agent who is helping Robie prove his innocence in order to get the jewels back and avoid a large insurance loss. And so forth throughout the movie, which packs a lot more action per minute than overlong modern action movies. About the only lapse is too much English spoken when people would naturally speak French, but subtitling in such cases was about as popular as filming car chases in actual chasing cars instead of a rear screen projection back in 1955.Highly recommended good fun, romance and adventure for the whole family, as Hitchcock knows how to disguise his sexual innuendo in tunnels (not this film) or fireworks (definitely in this film). It is a little chilling though to see Grace Kelly, even if only by rear projection, race dangerously on roads of the Riviera not unlike the one that claimed her life many years later.

It was just as hilarious as ever, and I am convinced that it 'will never die'. The casting is so perfect, every moment is so perfectly judged, that it is a film essentially without flaw. Anyone seeing it now for the first time should really get the DVD known as the 'Whatever! edition' of 2005, because it contains interesting extra features and interviews. One of the most remarkable aspects of this film is its fantasy fashion parade. The star of the film, the amazing Alicia Silverstone, who plays the character Cher, wears 56 different knock-out designer costumes during the course of the film. There is an extra on the DVD called 'Fashion 101' which tells all about this. Anyone interested in design or fashion needs to see it. The film's emphasis on costume for all of its characters had a ripple effect and caused a heightened awareness of fashion amongst the girls of America in the midst of the boring 'grunge' phase of the nineties, helping to make girls pretty once again and re-introducing that one essential which can never be replaced TRUE STYLE. After all, why should girls try to look ugly just in order to prove their equality with men? (Men can't help being ugly, but girls really have to work at it, so why bother.) They should instead try to be as pretty as can be in order to demonstrate their superiority. And hence the importance in the story of the hilarious 'makeovers' and attempts by the girls to out-trump each other by acts of style. This is the most wonderful satire of spoilt affluent Beverly Hills kids and their absurd class stratifications based upon money and 'popularity', that vague will o' the wisp which can vanish as the mist when the sunrise of real life takes place. Alicia Silverstone's cheerful and innocent personality, trapped as she is in a fantasy Beverly Bubble without even knowing it, really makes the film. She is simply irresistible and a natural comedienne. Never has shallowness been deeper! The satire is very pointed throughout the film, but is always laid on with affectionate and gentle mirth. After all, these deluded kids are not bad people, they are just helpless victims of their own vanity, stupidity, vapidity, and parents. One of the most hilarious characters in the film is Silverstone's father ('My daddy is a litigator, which is the most terrifying kind of lawyer.') Anyone who has known how ferocious litigators can be must have a good giggle seeing one at home who is out-witted at every turn not by an opponent in court, but by a smiling and teasing daughter. The satire on the appalling American school system is also so hilarious. All the kids sit texting and paying no attention to the teachers at all. The film is even more relevant now than when it was released in pre-history, or should I say the Pleistocene Era, meaning 1995. The film is brilliantly written and directed by Amy Heckerling, who has recently written and directed a new feature film starring Alicia Silverstone called VAMPS (2012) which I have not seen. Previously she wrote and directed a feature called I COULD NEVER BE YOUR WOMAN (2007) featuring Michelle Pfeiffer and Paul Rudd and Stacey Dash, who are both so brilliant in CLUELESS. So as a result of CLUELESS, a great deal of bonding evidently took place and there is now a Heckerling Family. Wallace Shawn, who hilariously plays Mr. Hall in CLUELESS was already her intimate friend and has worked with her at various times. How can anyone who has seen CLUELESS ever forget the romance between Shawn and Twink Caplan as Miss Geist? Silverstone's match-making between those two hopeless and gawky individuals was inspired by Jane Austen's EMMA, apparently. But Amy Heckerling needs no inspiration, she IS inspiration. This film is such a classic that I wonder if there is anyone with a sense of humour and fun who has not seen it by now. Merry Christmas and also Happy Hannukah and every variety of Seasons's Greetings to all clueless people, and may Santa slip the DVD of this wonderful gem into your stocking, just in case you are one of the unlucky ones who has never seen it before, or perhaps have lost your old copy and need a quick replacement, so that your holiday will not be incomplete and you will not suffer from lack of hilarity.

Unlike Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan, FMJ takes a look into a soldiers Psyche. It shows us how these guys actually went through hell to become Marines and how they are put under so much stress and pressure. Its more about their journey into the war than the war itself and that's what makes this movie stand out. Just an incredible film that is sure a classic. The totality of war, from the loss of self to ultimately the loss of life, has never been as thoroughly examined as in Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket.Its not only about of what does a soldier lives on the battle field is also all the process it take to become a man a killing machine, an excellent psychological movie that show you other side of the war stories.

While condemned, the fallout is eventually silently accepted, and the circle of criticizing and continuing the same way as before just confirms the tragic truth behind commercialism. Ratings are paramount, entertainment at all costs, sensationalism is what the masses lust for, and individuals, who die due to exhaustion in Survivor shows or are publicly humiliated by prank calls and driven to suicide, are part of the system. All that and more was already anticipated in the brutally outspoken 1976 satire Network written brilliantly by Paddy Chayefsky and directed by grandmaster Sidney Lumet. Was the picture visionary back in the days? Actually it was a reflection on the on air suicide of an anchorwoman suffering under depression. Nothing has changed. It's still all about ratings and money. Are you fine with that?Network with its startling performances (Peter Finch, Robert Duvall, William Holden, Faye television incarnate Dunaway), the shockingly dark and cynical script and splendid all around direction is as relevant today as ever, and it's the ultimate film about the amorality that permeates TV business. It is not to be missed, as it will teach you a lesson. It grabs you by the throat, no doubt, it chokes you, doesn't let you go, long after you've seen it. Alas, it's just a movie. If a film like Network despite its head-on collision course against the system cannot bring a change, maybe it at least contributes to help you consider altering your own viewing habits. No need to get mad as hell like the film's principal character Howard Beale, but a decisive I'm not gonna take this anymore will do to confront a mass media machinery with your individualism. To end with the last blood-curdling words of Christine Chubbuck In keeping with Channel 40's policy of bringing you the latest in 'blood and guts', and in living color, you are going to see another first &#x97; attempted suicide. The film's Howard Beale insisted to be a real person. Christine Chubbuck in whose honor the film was written was one. May she rest in peace.

Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. Shawshank slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison.From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really, he tells Red. Get busy living' or get busy dying'.The key to the film's structure, I think, is that it's not about its hero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity, our admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring, the film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we wonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he keep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like a free man on a stroll, when everyone else plods or sidles?People like excitement at the movies, and titles that provide it do well. Films about redemption are approached with great wariness; a lot of people are not thrilled by the prospect of a great film - it sounds like work. But there's a hunger for messages of hope, and when a film offers one, it's likely to have staying power even if it doesn't grab an immediate audience.

As a LitMajor\/Film Student at UCLA before becoming a schoolteacher, of course i love Dickens. So i was overjoyed to be able to use this Holiday movie and teach the elements of plot, character and theme with every grade level i have ever taught, except kinder, in 17 years. There was always a way to use this film suitable to the grade level, including once later when i substituted for High School. It was a behavior reward for them to watch it in class when their regular teacher was absent. I, diligent Educator that i am, added a requirement of writing a review of the film afterward as if they were Dickens. Which meant they had to read the original first, or someone in their small group had read it and could tell them; all creating a lot of discussion & engagement and acting out of the story. Day 2 of my assignment there, the Class voted to watch it next day. Just as background while they had a silent reading period because, as all the movie's fans know, Paul Williams' music is possibly even better than the story. I know this is a gushy review, & you really won't get very many of them from this reviewer. If i even have time to write more & there's no reason to write more unless i'm saying something someone else hasn't said. & not enough people know how great this film is.
