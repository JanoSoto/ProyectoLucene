The school's outcast Luke snatches Tingle's upcoming test answers, and delivers it to Leigh Ann.Mrs. Tingle finds it in Leigh Ann's bag and reports it to the principal, who luckily isn't present.That night Leigh Ann, her friend Jo Lynn and Luke visit Mrs. Tingle's house to reason and confront her.The conversation ends in an accident. Leigh Ann and her friends clean up the place and carries Mrs. Tingles unconscious body to her bed and ties her up.She wakes up and the 3 students try and compromise.....TMT, or What Kevin did after Scream, is a brilliant comedy, come teen horror, come 'look, the Brit is the baddie again!!' that actually rarely loses it's step.Mirren though outclasses everybody who she shares screen time with, and although the rest of the cast are good, they are no match for he fair dame.The story is strong, and there are a few very funny moments, along with a few dark scenes.But the film does fall into Scream territory during the final act, chasing up stairs and people hiding behind doors, it ruins the feel of the overall product.The irony with Williamson is still there 'Molly Ringwald as a supply teacher? and her career is basically high school rom-cams? Sold!!!' is what he must have thought.I'm surprised that this did so badly, given the performance and the narrative.In one sense, it does feel a little like Woodsboro, and IKWYDLS, and thats probably why it failed back in 1999.But I urge you to see it, it's quite satisfying.
