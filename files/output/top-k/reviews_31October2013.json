[{"date":"31 October 2013","score":"","review":" This 2000 Curtis Hanson film was the second best he made after L.A. Confidential and together with Bedroom Window. It is a story of two people of completely different background, a middle aged writing professor and his student and protégé. The professor, played by Michael Douglas in one of his strongest roles, is going thru a crisis and drinks a lot, after his younger wife has left him. He is also having problems finishing his second book. The young and bright but troubled protégé is played by Tobey Maguire. Then there is also Douglas' eccentric and flamboyant editor and friend played by the excellent Robert Downey Jr. A guy who is a swinger and according to Douglas is gay, or thinks he is. Katie Holmes also appears as another of Douglas' students who is smitten with him but he rejects her advances.There are also a few really amusing side characters, such as the man Douglas and Downey Jr. dub VERNON HARDAPPLE, who gives the movie a comical edge. The whole movie is somewhat of a dark comedy really, with scenes like the one where Maguire kills a dog who attacked Douglas and Douglas has to keep his body in the trunk of his car for a week or at the end where the manuscript for his latest book flies away.

This also helps him revitalize his own talent and get his life back on track. Frances McDormand also appears as Douglas' love interest who is also the chancellor of the university where he works and is pregnant with his child. Really enjoyable and trippy film, a semi-classic.

The film is packed with dark comedy, comical horror, offbeat performances and Gothic visuals that have become a mainstay in most of his movies. It has a lot going for it, but the execution holds the film back. The story focuses on young couple Adam and Barbara Maitland who are killed in a car crash, yet they live on as ghosts in their home. Problems arise when a strange family move into the house and any attempts to get rid of them prove to be useless. The only solace the Maitland's get is with the young daughter who happens to be able to see them. The Maitland's are left with no choice but to hire crazy 'Bio- Exorcist' Beetlejuice who guarantees to get rid of the family. The premise is an extremely inventive one, the idea of ghosts expelling humans does sound very funny and starts off well here. The problem lies within how it's told as the film loses focus the longer it goes on. The film lacks coherence as a lot of things come from nowhere and aren't explained well.The cast all do solid jobs. Alec Baldwin is very good in a reserved and very naturalistic performance as Adam, he comes off as a likable everyday person which means the ghost scenario genuinely confuses him. Geena Davis also puts in a very good turn as the laid-back and sweet natured Barbara. She too has a real sense of likability to her and the chemistry between her and Baldwin comes off as sincere. Winona Ryder is good as the goth inspired daughter Lydia. Ryder does have a good screen presence and comes across as innocently charming. Catharine O'Hara is excellent as the eccentric and obsessive Delia, she has a great sense of comic timing that is put to good use. Jeffery Jones is also great as calm Charles. However Michael Keaton steals the show as the equally bizarre, wacky and hilarious title character. His energetic expressions, exuberant delivery and knack for physical comedy work brilliantly here.Visually the film is a typical Burton one with bright designs mixed in with the Gothic styling he usually goes for. The ghost world that is created is really imaginative and the colour scheme used adds to the supernatural theme nicely. The humour is a problem with the film. At times it doesn't go as far with the comedy as it should do which means that most of the comic sequences are wasted while when does go comically over-the-top, the calypso scene, it just feels forced. The scenes in the afterlife offices and the ones involving Beetlejuice were the only ones that had the ability to draw the laughs naturally. The comic horror aspects are used effectively and balance out with the straight up comedy well. The special effects are very weak too. They are extremely dated and the usage of Claymation looks very fake these days. The music from Danny Elfman is quite good and carries that quirky dark sound that works perfectly well with in the film. On the whole Beetlejuice does have a fun premise and a brilliant Keaton performance, yet it lacks a fluid structure and truly funny moments to become anything great.

The reason being is that these films usually have such little versatility that if you've seen one, you've seen them all as Debbie Reynolds would say in Singin' in the Rain (1952). But I do know this much. The horror genre wouldn't be what it is today without legendary director Alfred Hitchcock or his highly celebrated 1960 suspense\/horror film Psycho. Its infamous shower scene has been acclaimed as one of the greatest scenes in cinema history, and is usually the first and sometimes only thing people talk about when having a conversation about this film. But as we all know, we can't call a movie great simply because of one scene, so let's take a look at what the rest of Psycho has to offer. A young woman named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is struggling to get married to her boyfriend Sam (John Gavin) because of their financial troubles. When a client at her job entrusts Marion with $40,000 in cash to purchase a house for their daughter, she steals the money and heads out of town to Phoenix to meet with Sam. While on the road, she purchases a new car in exchange for her old one, and then pulls up to an isolated lodging area called the Bates Motel to spend the night. This motel is run by a nervous young man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who lives with his ailing mother nearby. Without spoiling anything for those who haven't seen this film yet, let's just say that her stay at the Bates Motel is causing Sam, her sister Lila (Vera Miles), and detective Arbogast (Martin Balsam) to worry about her whereabouts. As I've stated earlier, any hardcore film buff that has seen this flick should already be aware of the shower scene and its significance in film history. It has constantly been dissected by film historians, Hitchcock experts, and whatnot. It has been satirized many times in pop culture either with the musical score by Bernard Herrmann or the actual visuals and shots themselves or even both. But since that scene contains major spoilers and has already been dissected to death, I won't talk about the shower scene in this review. What I will talk about however is the rest of the film itself which may be even better than most people give it credit for. For instance, how about the way the film's screenwriter Joseph Stefano handles the character of Marion Crane? Yes, the way the screenwriters develop the character of Norman Bates is also terrific, but more on him later. It's not every day you come across a film in which its main female character is willing to do anything including stealing money to pursue a happy lifestyle of her own. There's a very well directed scene by Hitchcock in which Marion is driving on her way to Phoenix and seemingly imagining what her colleagues at work might be saying while she's away. This certain scene works because we don't know for certain if it's simply all in her head or if it's really unfolding while she's out of town. Did anyone else besides me catch Marion smirking during this scene as if she enjoyed stealing the money? So we have this twisted characteristic to the character of Marion, and then we have Norman Bates himself. Norman's mother is so unusually dependent on him to the point that he has to live at home with her next to the motel. If this somehow wasn't surreal enough considering that he should be living a life of his own, he also begins to hate his own mother for what she's become. When we see Marion and Norman having dinner together at the motel, we can clearly see how much of a nervous wreck he has become on a daily basis. The way that Hitchcock and screenwriter Stefano handle the mystery behind Norman's ailing mother is very interesting since it arouses our suspicions that something may not be right in this motel after all. Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins have never had more memorable roles than here. Vera Miles is completely convincing as Marion's impatient, non- quitting sister. And Martin Balsam plays detective Arbogast as if he were a real, credible detective. The film is loaded with suspense-filled sequences and many elements of mystery even after its most iconic scene has passed. The dialogue here is interesting because while the characters do say some awkward things towards one another, you get the sense that it was supposed to be awkward and are willing to go along with it as a result. Bernard Herrmann creates yet another strong and catchy musical score that joins the ranks of his previous work in other Hitchcock pictures such as Vertigo (1958) and North by Northwest (1959). There's very little else that can be said about Psycho to those who have yet to see it without spoiling anything about the plot. It should be noted that Alfred Hitchcock decided to initiate a no late admission policy for the film since he believed that if anyone entered late, they wouldn't be able to see enough of Janet Leigh and would feel ripped off. That just goes to show you just how passionate Hitchcock was about not just the quality of his work, but also the audience's satisfaction with seeing his work. What else do I need to say? It's freaking Psycho.

Such traits also make it one of the best monster films Universal churned out. The film is almost a werewolf in itself creepy, unpredictable, difficult to define, often beautiful and misunderstood, and hard to forget.The film stars Lon Chaney Jr. in the career-making performance of Larry Talbot, who experiences a strange transformation cycle after being bit by a werewolf while defending a woman during an attack. The film begins with Talbot returning home to Llanwelly, Wales to reconnect with his estranged father (Claude Rains). Larry then meets Gwen (Evelyn Ankers), a beautiful woman who runs a local antique shop. In the process of getting to know her, he impulsively buys a silver-headed walking stick, which is said to represent the almighty werewolf.After rescuing Gwen's friend from a late night wolf attack, which, as stated, led to him being bit, he talks with a gypsy fortuneteller (Maria Ouspenskaya), who states the person who bit him was her son (Bela Lugosi of Universal's earliest monster movie Dracula from 1931) in wolf form. With this realization in mind, Larry is informed he will soon turn into a werewolf, to live a dual life between man and superstition.From the first frame of the film, you know what your in for with The Wolf Man. A film of many gripping scenes of suspense, careful performances, and beautiful makeup effects done by industry legend Jack Pierce. Consider Larry's transition from man to monster. The scene lasts mere seconds, but makeup-application and costume fitting took roughly ten hours to complete. The transition looks easy, but as always, the process was one of rigor and painstaking craft.Lon Chaney Jr.'s terrifically straight-laced performance only elevates the believability of the film. Despite the strangeness of the concept, particularly at the time, Chaney Jr. chooses to assume a personality of seriousness and one predicated off of subtleties. It's easily one of the best performances in Universal's lengthy line of monster flicks, and deserves a mention alongside Karloff's Frankenstein and Lugosi's suave Dracula.In addition, this is one of the few Universal monster films not directed by James Whale, but rather, George Waggner, who went on to direct Universal's color adaption of Phantom of the Opera just two years after the release of The Wolf Man. While I was consistently wowed by Whale's inclusion of massive and detailed sets and his infusion of wit to his material, I doubt he could've made The Wolf Man as well as Waggner. Waggner is concerned with atmosphere and tone, two things that weren't always in the forefront in American cinema. The Wolf Man serves as another film that makes it difficult to decide which monster film I enjoy the best.Starring Lon Chaney Jr., Claude Rains, Evelyn Ankers, and Maria Ouspenskaya. Directed by George Waggner.

With this realization in mind, Larry is informed he will soon turn into a werewolf, to live a dual life between man and superstition.From the first frame of the film, you know what your in for with The Wolf Man. A film of many gripping scenes of suspense, careful performances, and beautiful makeup effects done by industry legend Jack Pierce. Consider Larry's transition from man to monster. The scene lasts mere seconds, but makeup-application and costume fitting took roughly ten hours to complete. The transition looks easy, but as always, the process was one of rigor and painstaking craft.Lon Chaney Jr.'s terrifically straight-laced performance only elevates the believability of the film. Despite the strangeness of the concept, particularly at the time, Chaney Jr. chooses to assume a personality of seriousness and one predicated off of subtleties. It's easily one of the best performances in Universal's lengthy line of monster flicks, and deserves a mention alongside Karloff's Frankenstein and Lugosi's suave Dracula.In addition, this is one of the few Universal monster films not directed by James Whale, but rather, George Waggner, who went on to direct Universal's color adaption of Phantom of the Opera just two years after the release of The Wolf Man. While I was consistently wowed by Whale's inclusion of massive and detailed sets and his infusion of wit to his material, I doubt he could've made The Wolf Man as well as Waggner. Waggner is concerned with atmosphere and tone, two things that weren't always in the forefront in American cinema. The Wolf Man serves as another film that makes it difficult to decide which monster film I enjoy the best.Starring Lon Chaney Jr., Claude Rains, Evelyn Ankers, and Maria Ouspenskaya.

Such traits also make it one of the best monster films Universal churned out. The film is almost a werewolf in itself creepy, unpredictable, difficult to define, often beautiful and misunderstood, and hard to forget.The film stars Lon Chaney Jr. in the career-making performance of Larry Talbot, who experiences a strange transformation cycle after being bit by a werewolf while defending a woman during an attack. The film begins with Talbot returning home to Llanwelly, Wales to reconnect with his estranged father (Claude Rains).

It has a number of things that make it feel rather unique including the laid back tone, lack of a true villain and how it mainly teaches lessons about life. It is certainly one of Disney's most interesting and enjoyable films.The plot loosely follows the book of the same name, Arthur (mainly known as Wart)is a boy who aims to be a knight's squire. When out hunting he falls through the roof of Merlin, a brilliant but slightly eccentric wizard and his highly educated owl Archimedes. Merlin knows that Arthur has the potential for brilliance and decides to give him an education so he can achieve anything. Along the way they change into a variety of animals, meet the menacing witch Madam Mim and learn a lot about life. The story does have a very warm and inviting feel to it. It is an intelligent film presented in a fun way which lets you learn as well as be entertained, it doesn't try to tone down smart aspects and that helps it to stand out. The characters are all brilliant which is crucial as it makes the film work. Arthur is a likable, naïve boy who we know will learn from his experiences to become king. However it was distracting how three different people did his voice, which explains why it changes frequently and it can be pretty annoying. Merlin is a wonderful lead for Arthur, his dissatisfaction with the times and frustrations with Arthur are very funny as he's nicely voiced by Karl Swenson. Talking owl Archimedes is brilliant too, his reactions to events and grouchy outbursts are hilarious, and he also offers a good link between Merlin's weirdness and the real world. Mim is great as she offers the closest thing to a villain, making a good impression in her short screen time. The brash Ector and arrogant Kay are great support as Arthur's adoptive family. The animation is stellar as always, the 60s saw some really good looking animation. It is relatively simple, but it does feel very authentic and it fits in perfectly. The views presented of the castle and forests really do bring an authentic as well as nicely atmospheric feel. The film is certainly the most philosophical of all the Disney film which adds to its individuality, it's nice that it focuses on the trials of life rather than jump into all the action which can be a flaw of many Disney films. When the scenes of adventure do come along they are all the more effective. The adventures as fish and squirrels are really enjoyable, filled with excitement and suspense as well as plenty of laughs. The climactic battle between Merlin and Mim is just fantastic, they turn into different animals and duel which leads to some great action and animation. The climax involving Excalibur is also well set up and nicely uplifting. Disney's songs can be a bit boring, but here they are excellent, songs such as Higitus Figitus are really catchy and great fun. One of the few complains is the wish for it to have been longer, but given the time it was released it is understandable. One of Disney's stronger and more underrated efforts, it is a brilliantly enjoyable feature.

The films troubled production doesn't harm the film at all and it is one of the best westerns since the days of Leone's. The wonderful ensemble cast, exciting shoot outs and the nicely played out drama make this a really enjoyable film. The plot follows famous lawman Wyatt Earp as he retires to Tombstone Arizona where to fade into rich obscurity. While there he meets his two brothers and his friend Doc Holliday, who is dying from influenza. However, a group called the 'Cowboys' are causing trouble by ignoring the law and doing random acts of violence. This forces Wyatt to come out of retirement in order to put a stop to the trouble, all while he meets an actor he may love. The story is really good, as we see Wyatt do his best to resist becoming involved but in the end he has to do something. The large amount of characters get sufficient time too which is something not often seen and all of them feel very three-dimensional.The whole cast is really impressive. Kurt Russell is excellent giving a steely sense of justice and heart. He knows how to convey the integrity needed and comes off as no-nonsense very well. Words don't do Val Kilmer justice as Doc Holliday in one of the greatest screen performances of all time. He captures the rogue impeccably with the perfect look, quotable lines and unbelievable charisma. Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton are great as Wyatt's brothers as the both play it very naturalistic and create a strong sense of friendship. Powers Boothe is brilliantly captivating as the very charismatic Curly Bill. Michael Biehn is wonderfully sinister in an edgy turn as infamous shooter Johnny Ringo. Stephen Lang and Thomas Haden Church are excellent as the Clanton brothers, while Dana Delany gives a charming performance as the actress Wyatt falls for. The main strength of Tombstone is the way it mixes all the great things about the western genre together. It stays serious and realistic but never loses its sense of fun or witty dialogue, which means that the dramatic pieces do get helped along by some nicely comic moments. The action scenes are really spectacular as the gun fight at OK Corral and the showdown with Ringo have a lot of suspense to them. The music carries a classic western feel and makes the action, as well as the drama, stand out more. The dialogue of the film is crisp and feels real whilst carrying the romanticised charm that never comes across as forced, as mentioned Kilmer's Holliday has some of the best lines in film. It truly is an excellent script with a number of quotable lines. The chemistry between Wyatt and Doc, as well as his brothers, helps make the audience feel invested and makes the characters more dimensional.

I like all 4, and I'd say Ghost Protocol is technically the best one, but there's something about MI-2 that you just can't beat. What I love about the Mission movies is that each one is so different each with a different director, a different style\/flavor, and a different storyline - and its no different for Mission Impossible 2...MI-2 is its own thing, and it stands apart from the others, as it is more of an action film in the purest sense of the word, than any of the other installments. The movie opens with a boom and ends with a bang (and has a whole lot of banging of a different kind in between, if you know what I'm saying.......sorry for the lame jokes.......). Unlike the first Mission Impossible which was sort of a homage off to the original TV series with that old school Hitchockian style direction from Brian De Palma, this one is an dramatic, over-the-top, Hong Kong action movie from the master of action himself, John Woo.....The plot isn't important, its just a setup for the beautifully executed action set pieces. Now John Woo has a way of directing action, making it poetic and meaningful with his use of slow-mo, and not just loud and mindless like most so called action films of today. He is what Hitchcock is to suspense for action. Tom Cruise sizzles and crackles in the lead role (sometimes literally) as his long hair blows in the wind. Dougray Scott (who missed out on playing Wolverine in the original XMEN because this movie went over schedule) makes for a formidable opponent to Ethan Hunt. It would've been cool if the two had more of a history, that way the rivalry would've had more of an impact. Thandie Newton looks good, that's all that needs to be said there. The action in the third act tops everything before it. Everything that comes before is just a build up to the last 30 minutes.....Hans Zimmer's musical score must also be mentioned. The sped up tempo of the original theme played like a rock n roll song works great for the style this movie is going for. Its probably best score of any of the missions in my opinion. He also uses some very similar dramatic musical cues you'll hear in Gladiator (also released in 2000) which also work well because this movie is so jumped up and overly dramatic.......You may say this movie has no substance, character development, and is shallow and cheesy, and maybe you'd be right to some degree.

Everything about the film is simply amazing. The stylish characters, the incredible dialogue and the inspired ideas make this a true tour de force of filmmaking. The films offbeat and unusually laid- back tone add to its style and Tarantino delivers with an amazing script that holds it all together. The plot is non-linear and features a number of bizarre stories that connect the main characters. These all involve two hit men Vincent and Jules, crime lord Marsellus Wallace and boxer Butch Coolidge. The main stories include Vincent taking Wallace's wife out and the trouble it leads too, 'The Gold Watch' which sees Butch having to throw a fight and find his watch with some serve consequences, and 'The Bonnie Situation' (my favourite) where Vincent and Jules must dispose of their bloody car after accidentally killing their pal. In between these we get a robbery at a diner and a number of preludes. All the stories mix wonderfully and are packed with hilarious lines, intense drama and downright weird circumstances. The episodic feel means the film flows effortlessly and the pace never really lets up.Despite the massive cast, the acting is phenomenal. John Travolta re- launched his career as the super cool Vincent in a very naturalistic turn. Samuel L Jackson is amazing, with some of the best lines in film history he creates a truly brilliant role as wise-cracking Jules. Bruce Willis is great as the unfortunate Butch and Ving Rhames is utterly convincing as the brutal crime boss. Uma Thurman hangs loose and has a great time as Mia. Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer have great chemistry and brilliant lines as two would be thief's who appear at the beginning and the end. Harvey Keitel is wonderful as the problem solving Wolf, delivering a quick, witty performance as he does so well. The small supporting roles are excellent. Eric Stoltz is hilarious as drug dealer Lance, equally funny is Christopher Walken who is incredibly memorable despite being in one scene and Peter Greene is creepy as can be as sadist Zed.The script can't be praised enough. There are some absolutely hysterical lines and ingenious pop culture references. The films main power is that fact that it manages to mix so many diverse genres together so effectively, there are elements of drama, thriller, comedy and satire along with the powerful characters and complex plot which transforms the status of the film. Is it a drama? Is it comedy? Is it a thriller? It's impossible to categorise it and that is one of its strongest points. Another factor that makes the film feel unique is that in general nothing ground-breaking happens and there appears to be very little in the way of a message hidden inside. Personally this makes the film so smart because it's not afraid to simply show a day in the lives of these people, and they are so interesting and likable that you never get bored or want to see anything else.

Everything about the film is simply amazing. The stylish characters, the incredible dialogue and the inspired ideas make this a true tour de force of filmmaking. The films offbeat and unusually laid- back tone add to its style and Tarantino delivers with an amazing script that holds it all together. The plot is non-linear and features a number of bizarre stories that connect the main characters. These all involve two hit men Vincent and Jules, crime lord Marsellus Wallace and boxer Butch Coolidge. The main stories include Vincent taking Wallace's wife out and the trouble it leads too, 'The Gold Watch' which sees Butch having to throw a fight and find his watch with some serve consequences, and 'The Bonnie Situation' (my favourite) where Vincent and Jules must dispose of their bloody car after accidentally killing their pal. In between these we get a robbery at a diner and a number of preludes. All the stories mix wonderfully and are packed with hilarious lines, intense drama and downright weird circumstances. The episodic feel means the film flows effortlessly and the pace never really lets up.Despite the massive cast, the acting is phenomenal. John Travolta re- launched his career as the super cool Vincent in a very naturalistic turn. Samuel L Jackson is amazing, with some of the best lines in film history he creates a truly brilliant role as wise-cracking Jules. Bruce Willis is great as the unfortunate Butch and Ving Rhames is utterly convincing as the brutal crime boss. Uma Thurman hangs loose and has a great time as Mia. Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer have great chemistry and brilliant lines as two would be thief's who appear at the beginning and the end. Harvey Keitel is wonderful as the problem solving Wolf, delivering a quick, witty performance as he does so well. The small supporting roles are excellent. Eric Stoltz is hilarious as drug dealer Lance, equally funny is Christopher Walken who is incredibly memorable despite being in one scene and Peter Greene is creepy as can be as sadist Zed.The script can't be praised enough. There are some absolutely hysterical lines and ingenious pop culture references. The films main power is that fact that it manages to mix so many diverse genres together so effectively, there are elements of drama, thriller, comedy and satire along with the powerful characters and complex plot which transforms the status of the film. Is it a drama? Is it comedy? Is it a thriller? It's impossible to categorise it and that is one of its strongest points. Another factor that makes the film feel unique is that in general nothing ground-breaking happens and there appears to be very little in the way of a message hidden inside. Personally this makes the film so smart because it's not afraid to simply show a day in the lives of these people, and they are so interesting and likable that you never get bored or want to see anything else.

The film is easily one of the company's best and has barely dated. It features some of their best work which includes wonderful animation, memorable characters and a really engaging story.The plot sees inventor Geppetto create a wooden puppet named Pinocchio and he wishes for him to be real, the Blue Fairy decides to grant his wish. She gives Pinocchio a conscience in the form of a cricket called Jiminy to keep him out of trouble and if he behaves he can become a real boy. However Jiminy is given a difficult job as Pinocchio frequently faces the wrong types of temptation and it's an uphill struggle to avoid trouble. The plot is brilliant as it quickly moves from one sticky situation to another, never slowing long enough to be boring. The film has plenty of light and dark moments while talking about smart subject matter which keeps everyone entertained.The characters are excellent. Pinocchio isn't the most interesting of leads but he's supposed to be naïve, curious and easily led astray much like any young boy so it's a successful role. Jiminy is a lot of fun, always trying and failing to keep Pinocchio in line. He's laid back but has his limits while his exasperation leads to good comedy and his kind nature makes him likable. Geppetto comes across as a kind man, while silent pets Figaro and Cleo have some very funny moments. Honest John and mostly mute Gideon are an excellent double team and the funniest comic pieces come from their slapstick as well as strange humour. Both Stromboli and the Coachman are two of Disney's most sinister villains, Stromboli being intimidatingly loud and the Coachman restrainedly creepy. The Blue Fairy is a pretty decent guide.The animation is outstanding and some of the best Disney has ever done. When it wants things to be bright and cheerful it adds some beautiful scenery or colours, the scenes in Geppetto's house show that. While for the dark scenes it keeps a great gloomy and murky look, the Red Lobster Inn scene being prime example. A brilliant aspect to the film is the dark tone that it takes on. It never shy's away from the terrible things that can happen if you do wrong and can be rather frightening, the scenes of the kids turning into Donkeys at Pleasure Island and the whole climax with wild whale Monstro are now classic scary scenes. The fact that all the villains never get punished makes it different from the norm and it reflects real life in that way. The film does have a strong emotion impact, when it wants you to feel happy or sad or scared it makes you feel that way with ease whether it be via the artwork and the atmosphere. The music is superb too and the score itself is very memorable, the songs are fantastic as well as rightful classics including 'When You Wish Upon A Star' and 'An Actors Life For Me'. Overall Pinocchio is by far one of Disney's finest films and is a combination of everything great about the company.

I can even deal with the homoerotic undertones. What I can't deal with is the fact that we wade through about 40 minutes of this film before Freddy even gets his first victim. And the action didn't even get intense until the last half-hour or so.I thought this film was better the first few times I saw it. Watching it again, I've re-evaluated my position on it. They could have had a hit here. The formula for a stellar sequel is right in the plot. But it's so unevenly distributed and short-changed that it's hard to get excited. The character development is just fine. That is, Jesse morphing in to Freddy to bring him in to the real world. The problem is that they didn't present enough payoff throughout this particular plot point to really make the buildup worth it. Hell, the uneven pacing could have been forgiven had there really been a payoff towards the climax. We could write off a slow start had the latter half of the movie really wowed us. It too fell short.Also, when I say uneven pacing, I'm not just referring to the events of the plot. I'm referring to the fact that some of the scenes themselves have too much idle time in between character interaction. There needs to be a little less staring. If they were attempting to build suspense, it didn't really work. I just got that they slowed the scene down and made it harder to suspend disbelief. It could have been saved too, had it a great ending. But this is easily one of my least favorite endings to any of the Nightmare films. Now, the absolute final ending is okay. But Freddy's demise simply seemed to weak for me, not particularly believable. Nightmare 2 has some great points, too. The pool scene was, for the most part, excellent. A few bones to pick, again with the execution. But overall, it's excellent. And the cinematography when Freddy delivers his immortal line You are all my children now was also terrific. The problem was, it was over too soon. Not enough action, and not enough payoff when we finally received it.I have to also say that I like that they were ambitious, and strove to move in a different direction. That didn't bother me. It was still only the second movie in to the franchise. I also like that Freddy is still dark in this film, as opposed to wisecracking and campy (which he became in later films). But it all came down to how it was executed, and Nightmare 2 just falls short in that regard.Thankfully, Nightmare 3 was a much better movie. It also involved the Nancy Thompson storyline (which is only referenced in Nightmare 2). Thus, it's unaffected by this movie. This is a film only for the hardcore Nightmare fans (like me) who just have to see every movie. Otherwise, feel free to skip it. It's not the worst in the series (Freddy's Dead takes that by a long mile). In fact, I still prefer it over the more action-packed Nightmare 4.

The Ring is this small yet enormously powerful evil entity that feeds off people's desire for power and uses this against them to corrupt their mind, ultimately, to return to it's creator Sauron. This is seen through many characters, one example being Gollum as he has held onto the ring for so long that it has corrupted every part of his mind, body and soul. Similarly, Bilbo Baggins finds it extremely difficult to banish the ring from his possession because it has begun to corrupt him also. The ring's potential power and its mere capabilities are an unwanted burden that becomes an addiction to anyone who adopts it.

The story of this movie is quiet good, carrying lots of fantasy elements in it like guardian beasts, huge spiders, wicked queens, and a powerful artifact that can destroy the world. Unfortunately the acting is really bad. One may think that the actors in this movie, even the famous Arnie, never went to acting school. This is surprising because Neilson was much better in Beverly Hills Cop II. But in this movie most of the lines were poorly delivered and the script was incredibly corny.The plot is a typical fantasy plot. A powerful artifact is to be destroyed but the wicked queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergmen) comes along with her powerful army and kills all of the priestesses and steals the talisman. The thing about the talisman is that only a woman can touch it so Gedren is very happy. She then takes the Talisman to he castle and begins her plan to conquer the world. Sonja, who has come afoul of Gedren before, learns of the attack in which her sister is killed and storms off after Gedren.This movie seems to be an anti-feminist movie. Women have the power in this movie, in regards to the talisman, and play a prominent part. Sonja hates men and believes that she can get along with out having to rely upon any man. Yet Prince Kalidor (Arnold Swartzenegger) always appears and fights for her when it seems that she is almost defeated. This movie seems to try to say that women and men need to work together and they cannot write each other out. There is also the idea, as symbolised by Kalidor and Sonja being swordspeople of equal ability, that there is no difference between men and women and that they are equals.It is a shame that most fantasy movies only come out as half-hearted attempts at some entertainment.

Unfortunately the acting is really bad. One may think that the actors in this movie, even the famous Arnie, never went to acting school. This is surprising because Neilson was much better in Beverly Hills Cop II. But in this movie most of the lines were poorly delivered and the script was incredibly corny.The plot is a typical fantasy plot. A powerful artifact is to be destroyed but the wicked queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergmen) comes along with her powerful army and kills all of the priestesses and steals the talisman. The thing about the talisman is that only a woman can touch it so Gedren is very happy. She then takes the Talisman to he castle and begins her plan to conquer the world. Sonja, who has come afoul of Gedren before, learns of the attack in which her sister is killed and storms off after Gedren.This movie seems to be an anti-feminist movie. Women have the power in this movie, in regards to the talisman, and play a prominent part. Sonja hates men and believes that she can get along with out having to rely upon any man. Yet Prince Kalidor (Arnold Swartzenegger) always appears and fights for her when it seems that she is almost defeated. This movie seems to try to say that women and men need to work together and they cannot write each other out. There is also the idea, as symbolised by Kalidor and Sonja being swordspeople of equal ability, that there is no difference between men and women and that they are equals.It is a shame that most fantasy movies only come out as half-hearted attempts at some entertainment. There is truly very few good fantasy movies on the shelves of the video store. Fantasy is more of an uncliched genre as it has not really been explored as much as it could be. So far it has remained the realm of the novel but there is much room for it to move to the big screen.

The film is by far one of the most visually breath-taking animation pieces of all time and its dealing with the epic, mythical themes is done masterfully which makes a fantastic film.The film tells the story of Moses, he grows up as the son of the Pharaoh and enjoys life with his brother Rameses with no knowledge that he is really an orphan until a slave, who is his sister, reveals it to him. Moses leaves the kingdom and settles with his new wife, until he gets a vision from God who tells him to free his people. But Rameses is now Pharaoh and Moses must convince him to free the slaves or face God's wrath. The story is told in a serious and important why which is a smart move as it makes the events have more impact. The relationships help drive the story for example Moses' with Rameses, his wife, the slaves and God himself are all brilliantly looked at.The characters and voice work are pretty great. Moses comes across perfectly as someone slightly reckless but good-hearted. He grows into his position as the film goes on and is emotively voiced by Val Kilmer. Ramses is excellent too, shown as loving his brother but not wanting to be the weak link. For that reason it's easy to feel for him and Ralph Fiennes' commanding voice works wonders. Tzipporah is good support and nicely voiced by the sensual Michelle Pfeiffer. The husband and wife of Aaron and Miriam are decent as well as good support for Moses himself, even if the famous voices of Goldblum and Bollock can be distracting. Patrick Stewart's commanding voice is great for Seti and Tuya is a good sensitive character. Steve Martin and Martin Short as the high priests can get annoying however as they move between being sly and comic relief too much. The best thing about the film is the animation and its some of the best ever put to screen. Everything looks so grand and majestic it's impossible to not be glued to the screen. The view from the palace, the vast deserts and the sights of the city are absolutely stunning. The parting of the Red Sea in particular is just breath-taking and has some magnificent animation. The character designs are uniquely angular and the colours look wonderful. The film has to be commended for the themes it uses and the way it uses them in a mature way. The ideas of redemption and love are at the forefront of the film and they are never toned down. This allows the film to become more emotionally involving and there are a great number of moving scenes, such as the death of Rameses' first born and the burning bush scene. There are some strange things like the high priests who shouldn't have been used and more concentration should have been put on the plagues. All the songs used in the film are excellent and add to the story instead of taking away from it as some songs can do. The score from Hans Zimmer is superb and moves from sweeping to emotional with ease, the Burning Bush in particular is just beautiful. The Prince Of Egypt is a visual wonder and contains many brilliant elements that stay in the mind.

The film has a number of Disney high points including fantastic supporting characters, great suspense and a heavy atmosphere. The film can be considered another excellent feature for the legendary company.The story sees Dalmatian Pongo and his 'pet' Roger find love with two of their kind in Perdita and Anita. When Perdita gives birth to 15 puppies the cruel Cruella De Vil wishes to buy them but is turned away. With the help of her bumbling henchmen she kidnaps the puppies in order to make fur coats of them. Its then up to Pongo and Perdita, with the help of a collection of animals, to find the puppies and return to London. The story is simplistic but wonderfully executed. It has so many great elements that make it such an engaging movie, from the way dogs view their owners to the many escape attempts. The characters are superb. Rod Taylor is perfect as the very likable Pongo who we see as brave and caring as the film goes on. The relationship between him and Perdita is better than most as they do care for each other. Cruella is one of Disney's stronger villains, it's the way she is so crazed and manic but always trying to be stylish that makes her so entertaining. Jasper and Horace are brilliant henchmen, supplying lots of fun comic relief. Their so inept and clumsy that there's never a dull moment with them. The team of the Colonel, Tibbs and the Captain are brilliant. The Colonel is lovingly silly and Tibbs is so likable due to his never say die attitude. Roger and Anita are good as they are presented as a normal pleasant couple. The other dogs that help out like Danny the Great Dane and Towser are nice, solid supporting characters.Though the rougher animation isn't to everyone's taste it does fit in really well here. The way it looks fits in with the gritty darkness of London and the wilds of the countryside, it's a nice change from the angular style of the films preceding it. When you consider the amount of puppies they had to animate it's an impressive feat. It is certainly one of the Disney's most suspense filled and exciting films. It's not very often that a Disney climax has a car chase and it's an outstanding sequence. The whole search for the puppies has a brilliantly tense feel and watching Cruella search for them has some really well made strong moments. This leads on to another highlight which is the atmosphere the film has. The whole 'twilight bark' is a great piece and the scenes where Tibbs and the Colonel investigate the matter have a really effective dark feel. These are underlined by the superb visuals of a gloomy London and the demonic looking 'hell hall'. The music is also very memorable as it contains the usual solid score Disney does, as well as the fantastic songs ''Cruella De Vil'' and ''Dalmatian Plantation''. The other effective scenes include a humorous look at how dog owners are similar to their pets and the what's my crime TV show that's funny.

The film went significantly overbudget, past its original shooting deadline, had to work with the industries of Colin Clive and Boris Karloff, its two main actors, and the risk of having content issues with the censors.However, the film got back on its feet with going overbudget and past its date, dealt with Clive's broken leg by seating him in most of his scenes, dealt with Karloff's hip injury by casting a stunt double, and were fortunate to have the layers of the film dealing with homosexuality and necrophilia go over the heads of the censors (albeit some select lines of dialog). As it stands, Bride of Frankenstein is a witty work of monster art and an intelligently crafted sequel made up of satire and meticulous art direction.The film picks up where the original Frankenstein left off. Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) has given up on the idea of trying to play God, until his wife his kidnapped by his very own creation. To try and reason with the monster, and with the help of Doctor Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger), he creates the bride of Frankenstein, a lover for his original creation. The bride (also known as Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley) is played by Elsa Lanchester (this time she's credited as ?) in a performance of haunting beauty. The first image of her is the most revealing, with her unique hair and bulging eyes that seem to have direct access to your soul. The effect is achieved through the complex, strenuous aesthetic process of getting Lanchester to tape her eyes open.The film is a rare case where the sequel is often regarded as better than the original, but I'm not too sure. The film is definitely great fun, in its self-referential, often obnoxious glory, but it falls significantly short of its predecessor, in my opinion, because of the lack of real jolts or suspense in the premise. However, its significance as a monster movie makes sense seeing as it deals with not one but two monsters, regardless of what direction it chooses to take.I can appreciate, above all, the art direction and cinematography of Bride of Frankenstein, which stands the test of time for one of the best-lit films of the black and white era. It's a rarity for a black and white film to feature such precise and explicit lighting as this film, making everything clear and visible to the audience. Such lighting is necessary when you have art direction as detailed and as meticulous as this.One trait that seems to follow through with every single monster film from Universal, at this point, is the meticulous directorial style each director took. Whale, yet again, directs with a sense to include everything and exclude nothing. All the detail and decor of the macro-sets are captured and the immensity of everything is captured delightfully on screen thanks to Whale's all-inclusive directing tactics.Bride of Frankenstein is another film that is made even more significant, aside from being a great monster movie, because it should've been a complete disaster considering the problems it faced during production. However, it overcame such challenges and became a strong, memorable film thanks to its detailed sets, inclusive direction, great character acting, and a wonderful plot one can sink into. Films like these, even if I find myself not loving them as much as the masses, almost never lose their appeal.Starring Boris Karloff, Colin Clive, Ernest Thesiger, and Elsa Lanchester.

The film went significantly overbudget, past its original shooting deadline, had to work with the industries of Colin Clive and Boris Karloff, its two main actors, and the risk of having content issues with the censors.However, the film got back on its feet with going overbudget and past its date, dealt with Clive's broken leg by seating him in most of his scenes, dealt with Karloff's hip injury by casting a stunt double, and were fortunate to have the layers of the film dealing with homosexuality and necrophilia go over the heads of the censors (albeit some select lines of dialog). As it stands, Bride of Frankenstein is a witty work of monster art and an intelligently crafted sequel made up of satire and meticulous art direction.The film picks up where the original Frankenstein left off. Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) has given up on the idea of trying to play God, until his wife his kidnapped by his very own creation. To try and reason with the monster, and with the help of Doctor Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger), he creates the bride of Frankenstein, a lover for his original creation. The bride (also known as Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley) is played by Elsa Lanchester (this time she's credited as ?) in a performance of haunting beauty. The first image of her is the most revealing, with her unique hair and bulging eyes that seem to have direct access to your soul. The effect is achieved through the complex, strenuous aesthetic process of getting Lanchester to tape her eyes open.The film is a rare case where the sequel is often regarded as better than the original, but I'm not too sure. The film is definitely great fun, in its self-referential, often obnoxious glory, but it falls significantly short of its predecessor, in my opinion, because of the lack of real jolts or suspense in the premise. However, its significance as a monster movie makes sense seeing as it deals with not one but two monsters, regardless of what direction it chooses to take.I can appreciate, above all, the art direction and cinematography of Bride of Frankenstein, which stands the test of time for one of the best-lit films of the black and white era. It's a rarity for a black and white film to feature such precise and explicit lighting as this film, making everything clear and visible to the audience. Such lighting is necessary when you have art direction as detailed and as meticulous as this.One trait that seems to follow through with every single monster film from Universal, at this point, is the meticulous directorial style each director took. Whale, yet again, directs with a sense to include everything and exclude nothing. All the detail and decor of the macro-sets are captured and the immensity of everything is captured delightfully on screen thanks to Whale's all-inclusive directing tactics.Bride of Frankenstein is another film that is made even more significant, aside from being a great monster movie, because it should've been a complete disaster considering the problems it faced during production. However, it overcame such challenges and became a strong, memorable film thanks to its detailed sets, inclusive direction, great character acting, and a wonderful plot one can sink into. Films like these, even if I find myself not loving them as much as the masses, almost never lose their appeal.Starring Boris Karloff, Colin Clive, Ernest Thesiger, and Elsa Lanchester.

One of the most well-known cinematic icons of all time, Agent 007 has lit up the silver screen and wowed audiences for over 50 years, and this franchise shows no signs of slowing down. The character first appeared in author Ian Fleming's 1953 novel Casino Royale, but he's best known for the long-lived film franchise by Eon Productions. James Bond has since been ingrained as a major component of popular culture, redefining the film industry upon the release of the early films. Audiences hadn't seen anything like it at the time, and they couldn't get enough of it. Bond has since blown up on a global scale, and it all ties back to this first film, Dr. No.Despite being the first film in the series, Dr. No is actually based on Fleming's sixth novel in the series. As the inaugural Bond film, director Terence Young had a blank slate to work with. The clichés and archetypes that are instantly connected with the franchise today had not yet been established. Fleming wanted David Niven to play Bond, but the studio ultimately went with Sean Connery, who played a major role in defining what the popular view of Bond would become. He simply exudes confidence through his voice, appearance, and attitude. From that genre- defining first moment where we're introduced to Bond, he instantly slips right into the character. It's no wonder people often cite Connery as the definitive Bond, because his performance laid a lot of that groundwork for future incarnations. He's easily one of the best aspects of the film.The film sends agent 007 on a mission to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of a fellow MI6 agent, Strangways. While there, he teams up with CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jack Lord), a native fisherman named Quarrel (John Kitzmiller), and eventually, a woman named Honey Ryder (Ursula Andress) to investigate the goings-on at a mysterious island called Crab Key, owned by the sinister Dr. No, played with an eerie calmness by Joseph Wiseman. The plot itself is relatively standard Bond fare by now, but Dr. No makes for a satisfying villain, his plan is suitably evil (World domination. Same old dream), and his affiliation with the criminal organization SPECTRE leads to their recurring involvement in subsequent installments.Dr. No has a unique, naive quality about it. There's no tongue-in-cheek self-awareness here, this is the first glimpse that audiences had to all the different tropes that would develop in the series, and they're done supremely well. I've already gushed enough about how perfect Connery is as Bond, but his supporting cast is also suitably talented. Ursula Andress sets the bar high for all subsequent Bond girls that would follow suit, and to this day, she's still one of the best. The production design by Ken Adam, while not yet achieving the grandeur of later films, is still brilliant, establishing the iconic island lair that has since become a staple of the series. Dr. No himself, while underused, is a suitably formidable foe, and Joseph Wiseman makes the most of his limited screen time.The film is incredibly dated, and in many respects, it doesn't hold up well. However, I don't necessarily fault the film for that. It's definitely a product of its time, and if looked at through the proper context, it functions as a brilliant time capsule film, giving audiences a unique look into the cultural and geopolitical beliefs of the time. I would have loved to see audience reactions to this movie back when it first came out. It's a really revolutionary film, and at the very least, it's worth checking out if only to see where it all started.

The truth is that there is a lot about what he is producing that is simply not true, or even if it is true, does not actually set the scene properly. This film is a case it point &#x96; it is not really a film about an American company that is exploiting its workers, and destroying the planet through pollution, it is rather an ninety minute moan about how a bunch of factories closed in his home town and the effect that it had upon the town itself.At the beginning, he suggested that the reason that the plants closed was so that they could move the plants to Mexico where labour is much cheaper, and the truth is that this is happening all the time, but he seems to completely ignore the fact that Toyota still have factories in the United States which are employing workers, paying them decent wages, and making a profit. Some suggest that it is because Toyota makes better cars, and that is probably the case, however I am not one to comment because I have only ever owned one car, so I really don't have much to compare with (though I owned the Australian version of a GM, while my Dad owned a Toyota, and to be honest with you, I could not really tell the difference).Another reason why factories are closing and workers are losing their jobs is because of something called progress. With the introduction of robotics, there has been less need for workers to do the work that robots now do, but he seems to suggest that this is a bad thing. However, the company must remain competitive, and if the company were not to bring in a robotic workforce simply to keep people in a job, then that company is going to find itself in trouble. Further, with the onset of the GFC, GM actually did end up going bankrupt, and that was despite all of the cost saving measures that Roger Smith had put in place.While I am not endeared to the Republican propaganda that has surfaced with regards to Michael Moore, what we find is that Moore simply uses the same tactics as they do to simply make his point. The truth is that one needs to rise above those lies and deceits that are used to create a picture of reality that is simply not true. We have seen this recently in the Australian election, but the truth is that I suspect that the Australian people did not actually buy all of the rubbish that the Liberal party were putting out over the media, but rather they were simply sick of the in fighting and the back stabbing that was the Labour Party, and I suspect that if the Labour Party were to pull themselves together or (as I suspect will happen) the Coalition crash the economy in the same way the George Bush crashed the American economy, the there will be a massive swing away from them.
