And to understand why this film is great on so many levels, you just need to watch the sequels.In fact, the whole Look Who's Talking premise, which is about hearing the kid's thoughts, spoken by an adult voice, Bruce Willis, as original and clever as it is, would have been pointless if the film wasn't driven by a real story that could appeal to the parents who'd come with their kids in the theater. If the baby was the focus, it would have been a cute but forgettable film just like Baby's Day Out, something funny but without substance, or worse, a cult oddity à la Howard the Duck, but Amy Heckerling's film was about a mother looking for a fatherly figure to raise her son. And even this synopsis could have lead to a lesser film, if it wasn't for a nice touch of casting with Kirstie Alley as Mollie, and John Travolta as James, the first come-back before Pulp Fiction. There's something so natural growing between these two actors, who were not big stars at that time, and maybe that contributed not to distract the film from its simplicity. In a way, this is what makes the film slightly better, or more appealing than When Harry Met Sally&#x85;, because it doesn't look marketed to touch hearts, simple actors, a cast of honorable supporting stars, George Segal, Olympia Dukakis, Abe Vigoda, no big stars, but a great story &#x85; although, for the movie's defense, I think it should have garnered some Golden Globe nominations in the Comedy\/Musical category, if only for the lead roles.What makes the Alley-Travolta duo work, beyond the well-written script, is the great chemistry both have together, something that takes its time to become a reality, but when it happens, we know we're not watching cinematic clichés but real people. There's also another element, which is the genuine and authentic love both have for Mikey, the baby. Mollie doesn't play a mother, she's a real mother, as tough, vulnerable, hysterical or passionate as any other, and the complicity between James and Mikey is one of the things that I think touched me the most as a kid. James was more than a baby-sitter, he was a buddy for Mikey, and isn't this the true cement of a father-and-son relationship, being best friends?Again, the film deals with these subjects without flirting with stereotypes, it has the guts to evoke artificial insemination, to feature a hilarious scene of fecundation with spermatozoa riding their way to the targeted ovule following the Get Around Beach Boys' song, and it's always fun and charming because the material is treated with the level of humor that doesn't make you feel guilty to appreciate what you watch. That way, the movie is worth many Sex Ed programs indeed, my little brother never had to ask how we 'made babies' after this. The movie also features some borderlines lines as when the mother says that the artificial insemination is the kind of thing a girl does if she's very ugly or a lesbian. Offensive? Maybe &#x85; but wouldn't a mother talk like that to her daughter? This is the film's strength, every character speaks truly, the way we would expect and all these realistic interactions with the baby Mikey as the sentimental core, provides a great comedy film and so many memorable moments, among which my favorite, is the great dance sequence between John Travolta and the baby with I'm Walkin' on the Sunshine. There is one part where Travolta holds Mikey in his arms and a smile of joy which in no way, looks acted, I know the Pulp Fiction dance sequence will forever be revered as one of the greatest Travolta's moments but this one will always come as a close second in my memories.Look Who's Talking is a charming little film, with 'little' as a compliment, it never tries to exceed the limits of its ambitions, and is short enough not to drag on some parts, the music, the writing, the characterization, everything contributes to create this enjoyable feeling. And to end on an anecdote, I watched the film videotaped and for some reason, my dad stopped the recording right when the ending credits started, so I never saw the scene where they visit Mollie with her newborn baby Julie, the scene announcing the second opus. Apparently, Heckerling was already planning to make a sequel, but when Look Who's Talking was over, when we knew who'd be Mikey's father, when we heard his cute little voice, and saw what a movie where we could hear the voice of baby would look like, then what was the purpose of a sequel? How could have it been as original or appealing? I would have asked 'why' myself if I saw this, and this is why I failed to appreciate the sequel as a kid, and even more as an adult.

And not just an ordinary prison; a chain gang prison, somewhere in the rural, southern part of America.This movie has a very simple and very straightforward approach really but some movies really don't need much more than that. It's simplicity is actually what helps to movie forward and the reason why you remain glued to the screen. It's s true compelling movie, about real characters, kicking against authority.You could say it's a slow moving movie but it actually never really feels that way. There is always something happening, whether it be on the screen or in the character's heads. It's what really gets you into the characters and make you care about them. Yes, they are small time criminals but only because society regards them that way. You could also say that they are free minds, who don't simply want to life by the moral standards of modern society and don't want to play by the rules. People who say that the movie and its story is just pointless because they don't see what exactly message the movie was trying to get across should really watch this movie again, with a clear and open mind. With all respect but there is so much in this movie and to its main characters that it's really ludicrous to call this movie a boring or pointless one.The way the Luke character is set up and gets portrayed by Paul Newman makes him such a great and true rebellious character. By being different he actually slowly start to gain the respect of his fellow prisoners and as a viewer you can also really understand why. You'll slowly start to understand the character better and why he does the things the way the does. Unlike the authorities, you don't condemn him for the things he has done and does in this movie.But really the movie still would had not been as compelling and great to watch, if it wasn't for its directing approach as well. Even though its 1967 movie, it has '70's style written all over it. I really loved some of the movie sequences and was really impressed with the movie its look as well. It has some great cinematography in it by Conrad L. Hall, who lets the camera move a lot and gives us some great looking compositions as well. I was disappointed to learn that it didn't even got nominated for an Oscar but perhaps that was also due to it that Conrad L. Hall was already also nominated for a different movie that year and the other acclaimed cinematographer Robert Surtees got nominated for two different movies already. Having only three different cinematographers compete would perhaps had been a bit too measly. But having said that; this movie its cinematography would had totally deserved to win and is worthy of all of its praise.But luckily the movie did not got completely ignored by the Academy. It did receive 4 nominations but George Kennedy would be eventually the only one that also got to take the statue home with him. Quite funny, I never looked at George Kennedy thinking he was an Oscar worthy actor but after having him seen in this movie, I can't really complain about him winning.Perhaps the biggest surprise remains that this was more or less a one hit wonder from director Stuart Rosenberg. Prior to this movie, he had only mainly worked for television and after this movie, he never really delivered a movie of the same grandeur and stature again. It's why his name also probably won't ring a bell, unless to those who have seen the original The Amityville Horror perhaps. But it should tell you enough already about his career that the only movie people are still familiar with now days, next to Cool Hand Luke is the '70's horror production The Amityville Horror. A real mystery and surprise to me, since this movie shows so much class and talent, it is hard to understand why he never came close to that same level again.A real must-see movie, in my opinion.9\/10 http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"9 November 2011","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Only a few years after his role in the movie Hud, Paul Newman is back playing a rebellious character again, only this time set inside a prison.

But having said that; this movie its cinematography would had totally deserved to win and is worthy of all of its praise.But luckily the movie did not got completely ignored by the Academy.

Quite funny, I never looked at George Kennedy thinking he was an Oscar worthy actor but after having him seen in this movie, I can't really complain about him winning.Perhaps the biggest surprise remains that this was more or less a one hit wonder from director Stuart Rosenberg. Prior to this movie, he had only mainly worked for television and after this movie, he never really delivered a movie of the same grandeur and stature again. It's why his name also probably won't ring a bell, unless to those who have seen the original The Amityville Horror perhaps. But it should tell you enough already about his career that the only movie people are still familiar with now days, next to Cool Hand Luke is the '70's horror production The Amityville Horror.

And not just an ordinary prison; a chain gang prison, somewhere in the rural, southern part of America.This movie has a very simple and very straightforward approach really but some movies really don't need much more than that. It's simplicity is actually what helps to movie forward and the reason why you remain glued to the screen. It's s true compelling movie, about real characters, kicking against authority.You could say it's a slow moving movie but it actually never really feels that way. There is always something happening, whether it be on the screen or in the character's heads. It's what really gets you into the characters and make you care about them. Yes, they are small time criminals but only because society regards them that way. You could also say that they are free minds, who don't simply want to life by the moral standards of modern society and don't want to play by the rules. People who say that the movie and its story is just pointless because they don't see what exactly message the movie was trying to get across should really watch this movie again, with a clear and open mind. With all respect but there is so much in this movie and to its main characters that it's really ludicrous to call this movie a boring or pointless one.The way the Luke character is set up and gets portrayed by Paul Newman makes him such a great and true rebellious character. By being different he actually slowly start to gain the respect of his fellow prisoners and as a viewer you can also really understand why. You'll slowly start to understand the character better and why he does the things the way the does. Unlike the authorities, you don't condemn him for the things he has done and does in this movie.But really the movie still would had not been as compelling and great to watch, if it wasn't for its directing approach as well. Even though its 1967 movie, it has '70's style written all over it. I really loved some of the movie sequences and was really impressed with the movie its look as well. It has some great cinematography in it by Conrad L. Hall, who lets the camera move a lot and gives us some great looking compositions as well. I was disappointed to learn that it didn't even got nominated for an Oscar but perhaps that was also due to it that Conrad L.

This distraught and detached family struggles to stay together, having to battle one brothers heroin addiction, anothers short temper and violent tendencies, as well as the general debauchery that occurs within the lives of these people. This isn't a pleasant film and it isn't a happy film. It's a brutal depiction of London working-class districts and it will certainly disturb you to your core.The brutality of Nil by Mouth is unheard of. The film is a non-stop stream of cursing, graphic drug uses, and despicable violence. The film never lets up on the atrocity, leaving you no time to catch your breath. It's a fast moving film; one that doesn't stop to explain things and doesn't spell everything out for you. It's a completely character driven story with more character development in it than actual events occurring. Yet, enough happens to make the film plenty interesting. It slows down towards the middle as it sets up for its somber ending that leaves you with a strange and uneasy feeling in your stomach.Now, I'm always up for a great character driven story, but you have to be prepared for a lot going into Nil by Mouth. The thing is, the characters in this film are not likable in the least. They are the most despicable, deplorable, horridly atrocious people you've ever laid eyes on. Apart from them being sleazy and unattractive, they all possess the most unflattering personalities. The film presents a very strange family dynamic, having the characters constantly switch between love and hate for one another. Billy, the brother with the terrible heroin addiction, has his own mother give him drug money and also provides him with a place to shoot up. This seems like the most brutal form of motherly love until the two scream at each other a scene later, throwing the most horrendous profanities at one another. It is indeed some of the strangest relationships you could ever observe, teetering on being farcical at times, yet being sincerely compelling at other times.Overall, it is hard to become attached to the characters in Nil by Mouth. They certainly tell a fascinatingly twisted story, but don't expect to find any sympathy left in your heart when it's all over. This film disturbs me more than entertains me, but that is obviously the point. It is so harrowing and so horrendous that I can't guarantee you will want to watch it again once it's over.

I believe this film is responsible for my lifelong love of the genre- not just the films but also books and short stories. I love discovering the truly great ones. I believe everyone has a favourite movie, and if they don't, then they just haven't seen it yet. 10 out of 10 doesn't begin to cover what this movie means to me. A million wouldn't be enough. When I watch this movie, it makes me feel kinda happy! As a little kid, I would always seem to watch this around Christmas time. So this fun, but gruesome movie in which people get eaten alive and horribly killed, actually makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside! It never scared me a bit. I always found it way too fun and enchanting to possibly be scared by it. There's just one thing I don't like. It's when some big scare happens and the colour of everything will change to some bright hue. I don't think it works, it looks silly. For me it takes away from the movie rather than adding anything. This movie is not for all the sickos out there That is such complete bullshit. You're thinking of the slimy likes of Hostel there. All the music is fantastic and is a huge part of why I love it. Three little cues in Lonesome Death Tide and Crate are from Night of the living Dead. All the scores set the various tones so perfectly in all the tales... I love Vivica Lindfors performance in the first tale. So funny, so bitter! The grave scene where she drunkenly rants at her dead father is both moving and funny. All those wonderful mannerisms she does with her hands. The most scary moment in the tale for me is when Bedelia arrives at the cemetery and imagines her father's voice. So creepy. The Grantham zombie is one of the best, scariest zombies of all time. The worms in the face, dirt-rattling voice, shambling walk. Love it. I've seen it tons, but still feel the sweet anticipation of the final scene. Yarg! Head cake!!! So over the top, so awesome. What the hell happened next is what I always wanted to know! This is a great tale. You can almost set your watch by it... The second is the most loopy and humorous tale. The one I like the least. I always thought of it as something to get over before getting back to the good stuff. It's not bad, just a little less fun than the rest. Stephen King was never the best looking of guys. I thought he played the goof-ball Jordy very well. Bingo O' Malley was funny too, in the surreal daydreams. Loved that meteor! With that weird ding-dong sound it makes. I love the weird warbly space alien sound that hums throughout. And the grass! I do love the grass itself. It's cool how they made it look all strange and glowy, rather than just ordinary grass(!) Space grass apocalypse!!! The whole tide coming in element of the third episode is quite claustrophobic, and very impressively done. The scene where Leslie Nielson returns to the beach to admire his handiwork is very eerie. There is something uniquely creepy about a cold deserted beach with a ghostly wind blowing. When poor Becky and Richard come back as sea zombies, you can still recognise Danson, but Ross is completely unrecognisable. They look brilliant, all puffy and wrinkled and drowned looking. It makes it all the sweeter when they get their revenge on Nielson! Die jerk!!! Tale number four is easily the scariest. Fritz Weaver's babbling always bugged me. I first saw Adrienne Barbeau in this, so whenever I would see her in anything else, I would always remember her as the drunkard harpy from hell-Billie! She is magnificent. I love the horrible pitch she does with her voice. Even the monster can't stand the sound! Her funniest line for me is one involving Flipper! I actually feel a little sorry for her when she gets eaten face first! And it does sound like the monster growls thank you Henry! You never know! I love the monster's lair. There is something so marvellously simple and creepy about an ordinary place\/thing housing some terrible and deadly secret, and Stephen King knows this very well. I wouldn't bother with his short story version of The Crate though. Let's just say say they used the best parts of it. I just love mysterious creatures. This one's no mystery, though. I'ts the Abominable Snowman. Hello?! ARCTIC expedition! (Tazmanian Devil my ass) Fangtastic monkey devil. Obviously some kind of demon. The longevity's a dead giveaway, and the way that it can suck people up like a vacuum cleaner! Clearly crafted with such tender loving care. The ending is genuinely chilling, with the monster glaring up from the dark depths with those horrible eyes of ancient evil... From the murk to the deceptively bright and clean. Obviously, because it involves bugs, the final tale is the one that most gets under your skin. The cold clinical atmosphere and crazy bug music really gets you thinking of crawling things. I thought E.G.Marshall was terrific as a rich and mean old git who gets his apples. The moment when all the roaches burst from the dead Pratt's chest. That is one of the greatest horror moments ever. It's spectacular. Thank you George, for making my favourite movie, thank you Stephen, for dreaming it up with that brilliant mind of yours that understands the fun in horror so well, thank you Tom, for creating all your beautiful ghouls and beasts that so captured my imagination.

Rather, he was more concerned about maximizing its commercial appeal. In that regards, the three movies - The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and Return of the King - are successful. It tells a tale loosely based on the Tolkien classic. However, so many of the most basic facts are either eliminated or changed that by the time the Fellowship is formed -- beyond the names of the characters there is little resemblance to the trilogy created by J.R.R. Tolkien.The most egregious distortion is how Sauron was vanquished and The One Ring acquired - yes, the basis of the entire movie. The last alliance of Elves and Men came about after Sauron's forces had finally been driven back from dominion of Middle Earth and back to Mordor. A long and brutal siege of the evil wizard's tower, Barad - Dur ensued. In the end, Sauron himself came out.Perhaps the director had a problem envisioning what kind of battle must have transpired, but the greatest of the alliance battled Sauron up the slopes of Mount Doom, the volcano which forged The One Ring - Elendil, Isildur, Elrond among them. The director belittled the magnitude of the battle by having Isildur make a lucky swipe with a sword that cut off Sauron's fingers, thus separating him from the ring and making victory possible.Of course, if that were the case there would not have been a resurgence of Sauron. As anyone who has read the book knows, Sauron was beaten by force of arms, will, magic the full essence of what made the combatants great. Elendil's sword was broken when he fell upon it. Indeed, had it been shattered as they showed it would never have been reforged. Which is why Aragorn was able to carry it with him -- but that is among the more minor liberties the director took with his perversions.Isildur then cut the finger with The One Ring from Sauron's hand. The nature of the ring was that, in order to gain dominion over very powerful races, Sauron allowed the greater part of his strength flow into the Ring. Without it, he was diminished, but not killed. If being separated from the Ring vanquished him, then how was he able to come back? And wouldn't it have a much greater impact even on such a being as Sauron, to face the heir of the man who actually slew him, than the one who got a lucky shot.From that one major and totally unnecessary change, the connection between the movie and book was altered to such an extent that it was no longer the same.The other travesty was the failure to show the passage of time. It seemed that from the opening scenes of the party and Bilbo's farewell, and Frodo learning the secret of the Ring and his flight from the Shire, that perhaps a few months had passed.

The reason this film stands out to me is because it was the first time we read the book in high school but never watched the movie afterwards, don't know why. But anyhow I watched it today and I cannot believe my teacher didn't show us this great film. What truly steals the picture is Gregory Peck's performance as Atticus. He so deeply got into that role and gave it such passion which you couldn't argue his Oscar award for it. Dealing with the harsh reality of racism, the cruelty and seeing it through the eyes of an innocent child was just heart breaking. As a child we see things so black and white(no pun intended) and don't want to see the bad in certain things. We look at a human being past the age, sex, race or religion and as we grow older certain prejudices take place as the world can be cruel or raised with certain premonitions. To Kill A Mockingbird takes a look at the time where a black person was considered not to be human and reminds us that sometimes there is still good in those who stand against such ignorance.Scout Finch and her brother Jem, live in Alabama, during the 1930s. They begin as innocent children, who spend their days happily playing games with each other and spying on Arthur Boo Radley, the town bogeyman. Through their father, Atticus' work as a lawyer, they begin to learn of the racism and evil prevalent in their town, and mature painfully as they are exposed to it. The kids follow Atticus to watch a rape trial, in which an innocent black man, Tom Robinson, is wrongfully found guilty, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary and even after Atticus' earnest pleas to the jury for them to cast aside their prejudices against Blacks and instead to focus on the evidence of Tom's obvious innocence. The town turns against Atticus and his family claiming that they are N Lovers and torture the children only to be surprised at who is on their side.This film made me cry, not easy to do on the first watch, but there is a moment in the court room after Tom Robinson's unfair verdict and the blacks are sitting in the balcony above. As Atticus sadly packs his things leaving the court room, everyone leaves but the black folks above and they stand for him out of respect and love. It proves there are no small parts, only small actors and that scene was absolutely incredible. Also the moment where Atticus has to tell his wife that Tom Robinson is dead and she just falls in Atticus' arms almost killed me. Then to have this racist bigot come up to Atticus when you think he might have a shred of dignity to give Atticus some credit on a well fought trial, he instead spits in Atticus' face. Poor Atticus and Tom Robinson were never given the proper chance because of the color of his skin which still exists today in America sadly, we're just not as out loud about it which could be worse on some level.My only complaint about the film is that the beginning is a little slow paced for my tastes, I understand that they are trying to show the children's lives and what they like to do, but it didn't hold my interest too well. Then the scene where they see a rabid dog, Atticus comes and shoots it, why? What was the purpose of that scene? I might have missed it somewhere but I hate to see animals killed or injured and that scene was a bit much for me. Maybe it shows though that when he hears of Tom Robinson's death and the way he was killed, he has a little bit of guilt in the way he was so quick to shoot the dog like it was nothing. That's the only thing I could come up with at least. Otherwise, I think this film is still important today, even for 50+ years it holds true.

While not adhering entirely to the moral sensibilities of the Dark Knight which began with 1989's mediocre Batman It's with some amount of conviction that I truly believe that with his 1992 follow up Batman Returns Burton was afforded more artistic Carte-Blanche. Both with the narrative and stylistic content of the picture. Already having vindicated his clout as an inventive and visually captivating force to be reckoned in the minds of others after Edward Scissorhands critical and commercial success. BR for me personally boasted a movie with a more solidly structured screenplay, a more aesthetically appealing Gotham City and decidedly more intriguing interplay between the primary characters. The sequel this times took it's cue from two rather than one antagonist from the comics rogue gallery being the apparent choices. The Penguin (Danny Devito) and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). 35 years before the main events of the film take place, a millionaire husband whose surname is Cobblepot awaits the birth of his first child. What should be a day of extreme joy for he and his wife turns to disappointed bitterness when instead of a regular, cutesy baby they are presented with what they perceive to be a deformed mutant. Cruelly abandoning their tragic offspring, whose name is Oswald in to a canal. The current takes him to the sewers where he is discovered by Penguins from a nearby Circus. Leap ahead to the present and Gotham City is being terrorised by a gang of grim, colourful crooks calling themselves the Red Triangle Gang. Led by Oswald who has grown in to a twisted, repugnant villain they act upon his orders, the purpose of which is to forward his own mysterious agenda. Meanwhile dowdy secretary Selina Kyle, employed by millionaire industrialist Max Schreck is bullied and put upon by her arrogant, overbearing boss. A man who mocks her in front of not only the Mayor of Gotham but fellow businessmen. Then one fateful night a chance discovery of illegal activities approved by Shreck to drain the city of it's electrical resources via his own power station. Pushed out several storeys up from his office by her murderous employer she is left for dead only to be granted nine lives and resurrected by stray cats who she was kind enough to feed. Filled with rage and a determination to avenge herself upon Shreck she becomes the costumed, vengeful anarchist Catwoman! Only one man stands in the way of each wronged criminals way and that is Gotham City's most dedicated defender, Millionaire Bruce Wayne aka. Batman (Michael Keaton)It would be inaccurate to label Batman Returns as a simple comic-book, action movie and while it's basic premise sprung forth from the pages of DC Comics it was more a dark, Gothic opera with complex characters where the basic principals of good and evil aren't so black and white! Yes, there are elaborate, fun action sequences but they took a back seat to the more predominantly rich and beguiling personalities on display. Danny Devito is outstanding as the figurative Penguin of the movie. A man not only repellent on the outside but within. A sleazy, corrupt yet pitiful figure who is nicely mirrored by the conniving Max Shrek played here with chilling coolness by Christopher Walken. An actor who has cornered the market in such roles.

It is one of the first great films to depict the 1991 Gulf War as it tells a story of a US Army officer, despondent about a deadly mistake he made, investigates a female chopper commander's worthiness for the Medal of Honor.The movie was directed by Edward Zwick.Courage Under Fire has Lieutenant Colonel Nathaniel Serling involved in a friendly fire incident in Al Bathra during the Gulf War. He was an M1 Abrams tank battalion commander who, during the nighttime confusion of Iraqi tanks infiltrating his unit's lines, gave the order to fire, destroying one of his own tanks and killing his friend Lieutenant Boylar. The details were covered up and Serling was reassigned to a desk job.Later, he is assigned to determine if Army Captain Karen Emma Walden should be the first woman to receive the Medal of Honor for valor in combat in the Gulf War posthumously. A Medevac Huey commander, she was sent to rescue the crew of a helicopter that had been shot down. Finding them under heavy fire from an Iraqi tank and infantry, she had her men drop an auxiliary fuel tank on the tank and ignited it with a flare gun. Shortly after, her helicopter was also hit and downed. The two crews were unable to join forces. The survivors were rescued the next day, but Walden had been killed in action.At first, everything seems to be straightforward, but Serling begins to notice inconsistencies between the testimonies of the witnesses. Walden's co-pilot, Warrant Officer One Rady, praises Walden's character and performance, but was hit and unconscious early on. Serling then sees Walden's medic, Specialist Ilario, who also praises Walden. Staff Sergeant Monfriez, however, tells Serling that Walden was a coward. The members of the other downed crew also mention that they heard the distinctive sound of an M16 being used in the firefight during the rescue around the other helicopter, but Walden's crew denies firing one during the rescue, as theirs was out of ammunition. When Serling visits Walden's crew chief, Sergeant Altameyer, who is dying of cancer in a hospital. Altameyer manages to get some words out, further confusing Serling, before self-medicating himself into unconsciousness.Under pressure from the White House and his commander, Brigadier General Hershberg, to wrap things up quickly, Serling leaks the story to newspaper reporter Tony Gartner to prevent another cover up. When Serling puts pressure on Monfriez, the man pulls a pistol at him, then commits suicide by driving his car into an oncoming train.After finding Ilario, Serling discovers that Monfriez wanted to escape under cover of darkness, which would have meant leaving Rady behind. Altameyer was ready to follow his lead and Ilario was wavering, but Walden refused to go along, resulting in an armed standoff with Monfriez. When an Iraqi infantryman appeared suddenly behind Monfriez, Walden fired at him. Mistakenly believing he was the target, Monfriez shot back and seriously wounded her. Walden, however, regained control of her men.The next morning, Walden stayed behind to cover their evacuation, firing the M16. Monfriez deliberately lied to the rescuers, telling them that she was dead so she would be left behind. Altameyer, injured and unable to say anything was ignored. Ilario remained silent.

It is one of the first great films to depict the 1991 Gulf War as it tells a story of a US Army officer, despondent about a deadly mistake he made, investigates a female chopper commander's worthiness for the Medal of Honor.The movie was directed by Edward Zwick.Courage Under Fire has Lieutenant Colonel Nathaniel Serling involved in a friendly fire incident in Al Bathra during the Gulf War. He was an M1 Abrams tank battalion commander who, during the nighttime confusion of Iraqi tanks infiltrating his unit's lines, gave the order to fire, destroying one of his own tanks and killing his friend Lieutenant Boylar. The details were covered up and Serling was reassigned to a desk job.Later, he is assigned to determine if Army Captain Karen Emma Walden should be the first woman to receive the Medal of Honor for valor in combat in the Gulf War posthumously. A Medevac Huey commander, she was sent to rescue the crew of a helicopter that had been shot down. Finding them under heavy fire from an Iraqi tank and infantry, she had her men drop an auxiliary fuel tank on the tank and ignited it with a flare gun. Shortly after, her helicopter was also hit and downed. The two crews were unable to join forces. The survivors were rescued the next day, but Walden had been killed in action.At first, everything seems to be straightforward, but Serling begins to notice inconsistencies between the testimonies of the witnesses. Walden's co-pilot, Warrant Officer One Rady, praises Walden's character and performance, but was hit and unconscious early on. Serling then sees Walden's medic, Specialist Ilario, who also praises Walden. Staff Sergeant Monfriez, however, tells Serling that Walden was a coward. The members of the other downed crew also mention that they heard the distinctive sound of an M16 being used in the firefight during the rescue around the other helicopter, but Walden's crew denies firing one during the rescue, as theirs was out of ammunition. When Serling visits Walden's crew chief, Sergeant Altameyer, who is dying of cancer in a hospital. Altameyer manages to get some words out, further confusing Serling, before self-medicating himself into unconsciousness.Under pressure from the White House and his commander, Brigadier General Hershberg, to wrap things up quickly, Serling leaks the story to newspaper reporter Tony Gartner to prevent another cover up. When Serling puts pressure on Monfriez, the man pulls a pistol at him, then commits suicide by driving his car into an oncoming train.After finding Ilario, Serling discovers that Monfriez wanted to escape under cover of darkness, which would have meant leaving Rady behind. Altameyer was ready to follow his lead and Ilario was wavering, but Walden refused to go along, resulting in an armed standoff with Monfriez. When an Iraqi infantryman appeared suddenly behind Monfriez, Walden fired at him. Mistakenly believing he was the target, Monfriez shot back and seriously wounded her. Walden, however, regained control of her men.The next morning, Walden stayed behind to cover their evacuation, firing the M16. Monfriez deliberately lied to the rescuers, telling them that she was dead so she would be left behind. Altameyer, injured and unable to say anything was ignored. Ilario remained silent.

With that said, it's not even a bit ironic that a visionary Italian filmmaker orchestrated it all. Director Sergio Leone had done it before, of course, with the classic Man With No Name trilogy featuring western vet Clint Eastwood. But OUATITW is a completely different animal compared to the Eastwood series. While that pulpy, hard-boiled trilogy feels raw and uncontrollable at every turn, OUATITW is much more epic and somber in feeling. The best parts here are Ennio Morricone's terrific score and cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli's rich and haunting capture of the red and dusty Wyoming landscape. The story revolves around five characters who cross paths with each other throughout the film Harmonica (Charles Bronson) is a wandering vigilante, playing his harmonica more than he talks and on the hunt for Frank (Henry Fonda). Frank's a cruel, heartless monster of a man that kills without any feeling or remorse and just so happens to be in league with railroad tycoon Morton (Gabrielle Ferzetti) in a land-snatching plot involving the inheritance of Jill (Claudia Cardinale), a big-city girl thrust into the wild west, now alone and struggling to simply stay alive. Last but not least, there's the dangerous but lovable bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards), fresh out of captivity and ready to swing things his way, whatever the cost. The expansion of the railroad is the key element of this story. The ghosts of westerns past haunt the proceedings as the money of the railroad barons and thirst of the land developers evaporate the mystery and beauty of the frontier. Morricone cleverly composed a distinct score for each of the five main characters, with Harmonica's being the most intimidating, Frank's the most conflicted, Jill's the most tender, Morton's the saddest and Cheyenne's the most deviously playful. It adds a whole new level to the film and will leave you humming Cheyenne's theme long after the movie is over.
