Jimmy spends his days wandering about town, inventing fantastical personal histories for the various strangers who catch his eye.Jimmy's fantasies spiral out of control when he meets Renee (Beverly D'Angelo), a stylish older woman. Jimmy stalks Renee, visits her at the theatre houses at which she works, and becomes increasingly infatuated with her; he's in love. These desires quickly become perverse, untenable and then collapse, the film eventually revealing that Renee is in fact Jimmy's mother.The majority of Jordan's films clash fairy tales and fantasies with a reality that is squalid, criminal and perverse. Rather than clear cut demarcations between fantasy and reality, however, Jordan finds the fairy tale conventions lurking within crime narratives, and finds the crime conventions lurking within familiar fairy tale narratives. Elsewhere his characters are often unable to be together thanks to national, sexual or biological differences which make romance impossible. Filled with fantasy objects who are revealed to be different genders, species (vampires, werewolves, mermaids etc), incestuous relatives, homosexuals or transsexuals, Jordan's objects of affection are almost always off limits.For most of its running time, The Miracle is beautifully unhurried. Low-key, atmospheric and filled with interesting sea-side locales, the film unfolds like a noirish dream, complete with stalking sequences evocative of Alfred Hitchcock's Veritgo. Unfortunately the film's relaxed approach eventually gives way to much uninteresting Oedipal melodrama.Similar to The Miracle is Jordan's Mona Lisa. Released in 1986, the film stars Bob Hoskins as George, an ex-convict who is hired to ferry a call girl, Simone (Cathy Tyson), around London. Though they initially feud, George quickly becomes infatuated with Simone, and begins to see himself as her guardian angel, her white knight, her lover. Simone nurses these fantasies, but eventually reveals that she is in fact not attracted to George; she's homosexual.Jordan's use of the fairy tale is not a correction or parody of their supposedly outdated values, writer and professor Carole Zucker once wrote, rather, he investigates what it means to listen to fairy tales, what it means to trust narrative and what it means to follow their paths. His films often show the messy results of fairy tales, the awkward ways in which we interact with our shared store of narratives and the complex interrelation of past and future that make fairy tales such vivid material for impassioned pastiche. We see this in Mona Lisa, as George imposes upon Simone a fairy tale that she shares, allows and secretly wishes to make real. Together the duo warp London &#x96; a perverse hell-hole filled with shadowy spaces, monsters, prostitutes and violence &#x96; turning it into their own magical fantasy-land, complete with modern chariots, damsels, white-knights and noble quests. Simone eventually abandons this charade, leaving George disillusioned.Perhaps because she is bisexual, and fond of Jordan's past explorations of sexuality, actress Jodie Foster approached Jordan with a script in the mid 2000s. This would evolve into The Brave One, a 2007 work-for-hire which Jordan struggled to make his own.Set in New York City, The Brave One stars Foster as Erica. In love with her city, Erica spends her days fawning over New York's past, admiring its spaces, recording the city's sounds and praising it on her live radio show. This idyll is shattered when Erica's lover is violently murdered, a murder which is give racial\/political connotations given the victim's ethnicity and given the films nods to the infamous 9\/11 terror attacks. Jaded, disillusioned and seeking to resurrect her fantasy, Erica buys a gun and becomes a vigilante; she begins taking the law into her own hands.Vigilatees and angelic defenders are common in Jordan's filmography (see his debut, Angel). In The Bave One, however, Erica is herself defended by the police detective (Terrence Howard) tasked with taking her down. The duo thus rekindle Jordan's obsession with impossible love, the criminal and the cop locked in unholy passion.Fittingly, The Miracle, The Brave One and Mona Lisa all contain major characters who are writers and so tireless fantasists. In Mona Lisa, George's best friend is a crime fiction writer. In The Bave One, Erica herself strings words lovingly together, and in The Miracle, two aspiring writers spend their days constructing wild tales. For Jordan, human beings are rarely more than heart-broken delusion machines.8\/10 - Worth one viewing.

The ex-assassin back from the dead as a demonic hellspawn (from hell) armed to the teeth with weapons and with a living suit that is able to metamorphosis into virtually anything that is required at any given moment...handy. His world is dangerous, dark, grimy, violent, savage, chaotic, vicious and bloodthirsty. He has battled thugs, drug dealers, pedophiles, murderers, the KKK and various creatures from the bowels of hell.If there is any comicbook character that is definitely not for young kids then this is it. Could this comicbook character be anymore badass? the material screams out for a solid ultra violent adult movie adaptation. How could anyone even consider the notion of making a PG-13 out of this graphic splatter fest! ahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!..bahaha!..haha...hehe...ahem...oh.I quite liked this despite many problems with the movie. Unfortunately this characters outing has aged badly showing some horrendous early CGI effects which will shock you. The visuals are generally decent at times, like the comic its very dark, Gothic and grim, but its also very obviously filmed on sets and looks a bit fake. Sure the cold night rain comes down in sheets whilst the mist swirls as Spawn leaps around in his fantastic looking living suit...but you need more than that. The other fantasy based creatures are also well created, Clown especially...very dark, humorous and quite chilling. Leguizamo played him brilliantly swinging from reasonably placid too nasty, vicious and perverted in the bat of an eyelid. Best thing about the film easily, kudos.The Violator is also pretty cool looking in a life size model form yet like a lot of the film the CGI version is pretty lame and ruins it. CGI is a problem with this film as its drenched in it, almost everything is CGI and frankly not much is any good. Jesus Christ even the opening credits are rendered in hokey-ass looking CGI! you can tell back in 97 CGI was the new toy.On the whole the CGI ranges from excellent on Spawns cape, to poor video game type visuals on most other things. Hell being the worst with a terrible looking Malebolgia and very plain unexciting looking backdrops, it looks like a student created it at home. The whole thing is very amateurish looking these days it really is, heck even back in the day it didn't come across that well. What's laughable if you look closely is all the legions of Hellspawns are clearly on some kind of animated loop as they all do the same action in the background! Its so obviously the same actor replicated a gazillion times, seriously poor.The best CGI is probably the work done on Spawn's mask, apart from his cape that is. The small sequences where we see his living suit\/mask slide and form over his burnt face is still pretty slick even to this day. Sure his eyes look a bit too big and green but on the whole his mask does look the business. The fact its wet really gives it a living vibe, as though its pulsating, its one of things that does work in this movie.The acting is hammy with a slight serious edge, but in general its very cheesy. Sheen chews up the scenery and seems to enjoy himself whilst Jai White seems to be going for broke possibly after more comicbook roles. Clearly not expecting much here but this is suppose to be a dark violent franchise, lets try and be somewhat realistic and less camp huh. This film yearns to be harder and more violent (like the comic, what a waste), it is dark brooding and Crow-like for sure but its so watered down its quite painful.Despite that there is this uneasy feeling throughout where you're not too sure which way the film wants to go. Is it really for a wider audience? is it maybe more for adults? certain scenes seem quite risky and close to the bone but then at the same time its all so docile with no real visible violence or blood, realistic or otherwise. It gives the film an unbalanced feel because its lost somewhere in the middle which will leave both sides of the equation not enjoying the film. Like other similar comicbook franchises they must decide which way they wanna take it, its gotta be for kids or not, simple as that.Despite that it does have a certain charm which appeals to me, its dark Batman-esque world with hellish creatures and brooding anti heroes still manages to be enjoyable. Spawn being a very likable character, Wynn is also suitably creepy and Bishop is changed to a female for some reason but pretty hot with some nice gun\/blade action. Add some relatively decent action sequences which are kinda fun in a tame kinda way and you can almost get some enjoyment outta this. At least there's a solid thumping soundtrack to be had.I still wonder what could of been, what it could of achieved had it been made for adults as it should of been. Visually its pleasing if you like this kind of thing (in general), there is just enough comicbook sleaze here to get your teeth into and it still beats 'Ghost Rider' any day of the week.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 March 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Ah Spawn, we all know and love this McFarlane creation don't we.

But right after he starts work, the bike is stolen. This feels like an apocalyptic turn of events, thanks to the way director Vittorio De Sica and screenwriter Cesare Zavattini have crucially conveyed all that this one bicycle means; the one thing keeping this family from falling into an impoverished abyss.

Not that female leads are bad, quite the contrary, but I didn't expect such complex characters from an era where women weren't as well respected. Maybe I exaggerate in that statement, but this movie was extremely well done and I admire it greatly for demonstrating people in this way.Every character was likable in at least some aspect, which is important for the audience to identify with each individual. In a way, I identified with every single character in there at least in minor ways (no, not with Veda; if I did, then be terrified). I found that so profound that I was able to like every character and see their flaws yet still appreciate them even when they did horrible things, like Pierce's late husband and Veda. Maybe it was because I saw some of their history before everything crapped out on them, but regardless the amount of detail put into each character despite their circumstances was quite a rare occurrence.I didn't quite understand Pierce's attachment to Veda, however, even from the start. I'm assuming it had to do with her being a devoted mother and only wanting the best, which was said, but even still I found it hard to believe that a good mother and person like Pierce would dive so low as to support her daughter in situations like the ones in the movie. If I were the mother, I would have dropped her like a sack of potatoes, or if not drop them fry them and eat them with ketchup. A lot of it was outrageous, but at the same time believable if that makes any sense. I guess in a way it's not unheard of that people would do crazy things for love, and because Pierce was the person that she was she took every fall. I admire her a bit for that, because I suppose I see myself in her. My heart went out to her.Along with a few rare films I've rated this high, this is one of them.

Writer-director David Lynch, working with Barry Gifford on the writing, dared to create a story drawn from as much from intuition and artistic energy as from meticulous staging and cinematic crafts of a high order. Lynch knows the making of a movie from A to Z. He knows the cinematic artistic vocabulary and how to use it. Combine these skills with his willingness to go way out on a limb in story, and the result is a masterpiece. Lynch knows exactly how long a shot should be held to achieve the result he wants. He knows exactly how he wants the set to look and how it is to be lit. The lighting and color in this movie are tailored perfectly to the story and desired effects. Lynch draws from the capable cast precisely the ambiguities and delineations of character and circumstance that he wants. Lynch is in perfect control of his craft and this film, but he also has tapped into creative levels that are less controlled and more intuitive. Cinematic intelligence plus intuitive artistic depth, the combination is dynamite.The amnesia and the traumas of war that appear in enough classic noirs to be noticeable have morphed into identity issues and serious pathologies of the mind in neonoirs. Lost Highway is deeply into the latter. The protagonist, Bill Pullman, clearly has serious problems of the mind. The story can only be understood when this is realized. The story appears to be told objectively from outside Pullman's mind but its flow can only be grasped by realizing that we are participating in his subjective dreams, delusions and fashionings of reality. Lynch has said that creatively he drew some inspiration from what he conceived to be the state of mind and denial of reality on the part of O.J. Simpson.Lost Highway is also in some respects as much a horror movie as it is a neo-noir. It has a number of shocks of action and setting akin to what occur in a horror movie. It has a Mystery Man (Robert Blake) who is a devilish figure. Even its gangster-type porno film producer, Robert Loggia, has a strong devilish aspect. The story has a mutation of Bill Pullman into another character, Balthazar Getty, within a locked death row cell, and this has a supernatural connotation. The sets throughout are typically unreal looking and foreboding. Then there is the doppelganger aspect that comes in with both Pullman and Patricia Arquette. But in the final analysis, there are no supernatural elements in this movie. There are creations of Pullman's troubled mind that bring forth a highly distorted view of reality that seems demonic and oppressive.Neo-noir is proving to be an approach to stories and cinematic story-telling that is very rich in its possibilities. Lost Highway brings to mind other films that plumb depths, such as Cache (2005), I Stand Alone (1998), and Shutter Island (2010), but there are many more including sci-fi stories whose common thread is a high degree of dislocation of the protagonist.

Unfortunately that promise ends up being well and truly squandered. Cary Grant plays Nickie Ferrante, a well-known playboy-type sailing from Europe to New York. Waiting for him in New York is his exceedingly wealthy fiancée. Their wedding is huge news, the famous ladies' man settling down. Reporters can't wait to get a piece of Nickie when he gets to New York. But on the ship there are complications. Those complications come in the form of Terry McKay, played by Deborah Kerr. Terry, much like Nickie, has a lover waiting for her in America. But, despite a seeming initial distaste for one another upon first meeting, Nickie and Terry fall in love. Theirs is a very chaste affair, this is a film made in 1957 after all, but there is no doubt that by the time they get to New York Nickie and Terry desperately want to be with one another. So then what? Well sadly then the movie falls apart.Grant and Kerr have an easy, appealing chemistry as their characters fall in love aboard the ship. Their efforts to keep their newfound relationship hidden away from the prying eyes of their shipmates are amusing. When the ship docks briefly in France a visit by the couple to Nickie's wonderfully sweet grandmother warms the heart. It is during this visit that they realize their true feelings for one another. Back on the ship they go and there is no longer any pretense they're in love. But their being in love will cause all kinds of problems. Nickie is about to be married and, with no income of his own, marriage to a very wealthy woman can be quite useful. Meanwhile Terry's boyfriend seems to have marriage on the brain too. Can Nickie and Terry extricate themselves from their respective relationships? Should they? Toss away these long-standing relationships to be with someone you just met? Nickie and Terry come up with a plan. They'll take some time apart, sort things out and reconnect months later. The best laid plans...So, things don't really go according to plan. The movie contrives a way to keep Nickie and Terry apart. And thus does the movie fall to pieces. Whatever charm the movie had with Grant and Kerr working together is completely lost when they're apart. The second half of the film is a boring slog. Quite a drag. Then a bunch of kids show up out of nowhere for a couple of truly excruciating musical numbers. By this point the movie is a total disaster. It would be bad enough if there was at least a reason to keep Nickie and Terry away from one another. But there isn't, there's just one character being so stubborn and stupid that it's mind-boggling. It's a false way to try to create drama and it fails miserably. The movie just goes on and on, going on for so long that you forget why you were ever interested in the first place. The great promise shown in the first half of the movie comes to nothing. And then after boring you to tears for the better part of an hour the film rushes through a climax which is absurdly jarring and abrupt. Add it all up and this becomes a movie to forget.

Say, five or ten minutes of exposition, the pivotal plane, crash, the Island and then make it end with the freighter passing by an exhausted Chuck Noland on his raft? Maybe it would have puzzled many viewers but I think the movie would have worked better.That ending would have been the film in a nutshell  a man overcoming the limitations he inherited from comfortable and convenient modernity in order to domesticate wildlife, to make everything we take for granted a challenge worth to triumph over, and to find over patience and intelligence, the strength to go back to civilization. Cast Away was the modernization of the stranded-in-an-Island myth, of the Robinson Crusoe figure, something that was begging to catch the eye of a talented filmmaker, which it did.The before-and-after are only important on a minor screen writing scale, yes we have a character's arc to close, a man who starts as a cocky workaholic employee for FedEx and then discover that there's more in life than stress around the clock, if you try to challenge time, beware that time challenges you (that would've made an interesting tag-line) We've been through that thousands of times anyway, so why wouldn't Zemeckis trust our intelligence and spare us the whole sequence of Chuck 'learning his lesson' while he's back to ordinary life? Indeed, the film is told through Chuck's perspective, like him, we find ourselves confined in a hostile world, after a spectacular crash sequence, we discover the island through his eyes the loneliness, the silence only covered by the perpetual sound of tides, the darkness only enlightened by the shining stars. It's nature at its most majestic and scary. Then step by stem, through a meticulous and patient directing, we see Chuck trying to get over each step of comfort finding anything that would make shoes, food or habitat. Anything with what is at hands.And no matter how famous Robinson Crusoe's story is, or how used to Survivor reality shows we are, this is cliché-proof, because although we know it's a matter of time before he learns fishing, before he makes fire or ropes, Zemeckis opts for a documentary-film like precision that keeps our eyes hooked on the 'how' rather than on the 'when'. We don't have time to wonder what will happen when we're fascinated by what we see. And Tom Hanks brings so much naturalness than we share every feeling he has, even the ache on his teeth and the inconvenient self-made remedy he makes, is something we can oddly relate to.The trickiest part of the film is with Kelly (Helen Hunt). She represents his last connection to the real world, but for some reason, I wasn't impressed by the flash in \/ flash out sequences on her little picture in the pocket watch. She's his love life, okay. He was about to propose her before the crash, got it. But didn't he have parents? Cousins? Friends? The character of Kelly was made like an artificial synthesis of every human relationship in Chuck's life it made the ending even more incongruous, as if Chuck was just a man of his job and a woman. Then having lost one, he had to focus on the other. The romance was too predictable for such an epic start.And I'm sure Cast Away would be regarded as a masterpiece had it focused on the Island, not just a classic film of the early 2000's. The only emotional climax it deserved was the farewell to Wilson. Yes, Wilson! The film's ticket to immortality, a character made of a Volley Ball with a bloody hand that drew a smiling figure, a hazard leading to Chuck having finally someone to speak to. Wilson confirms what was hinted in the pilot's burial sequence, a man needs to be a man, and one of the first manifestations of civilization were funerals. A man needs abstractions, he needs to communicate and that's what Wilson is, and we're so in-line with Hanks performance that we take Wilson as a person too, and his disappearance is heartbreaking.And it was necessary, because that was the only way for Chuck to lose the ultimate connection with the Island, to be normal again. At one point of dementia, he was almost going to drown just to catch a damn volleyball, this was the final test before finally getting back to his senses, and waiting for either death or a boat to catch him. The death of Wilson, so to speak, was the only possible climax. Having Chuck getting back to life and discovering all its insolent accommodations of modern life, sleeping on the ground, having troubles is important on a broad way, but not within the context of the film.So, why not leaving that for our imagination? I thought a man like Chuck would become an instant celebrity, would publish a book, would understand Kelly getting married, would get back to his family etc. etc. Oddly enough, Hanks plays the second Chuck like a kind of Forrest Gump whose slowness would result from that trauma. It's like watching a whole other film. A pity that the film gets drown in cinematic conventions for a concept that asked for more simplicity and straightforward narrative, and I suspect the film would have garnered more awards and nominations had it focused on that, and if Zemeckis was so eager showing the aftermath, then make a two-part movie and leave the Island for this one.The Island sequence was enough to make a masterpiece or in other words why would you put a cliché kiss-in-the-rain scene in a film where the most memorable relationship and interaction is between a man and a volleyball !!!

It's been a long time since I've seen the remake so I'm not really in a position to give a 'blow by blow' analysis of the two films, but I do remember enjoying the remake much more than I enjoyed this film.The film throws in a plot twist later involving heads of the 5 Casinos and Duke Santos (who figures out that Oceans gang have stolen the money). The Casino bosses offer Santos 30% of the total money that's stolen if he's successfully able to recover the full amount. This twist perked my interest, but it never went anywhere and seemed pointless when we then learn what direction the film took at the end (I'll admit it was surprising, but not in a good way - I actually found the ending a bit dumb and anti-climactic if I'm being totally honest).I had high hopes for this film and figured that because I enjoyed the remake that I must surely enjoy the original. However, despite a strong start, the odd bit of light humour and a relatively clever middle section, the film is counter-balanced by an over-long set-up, unnecessary soap opera and for the most part it just lacked fun and excitement. Mediocre and not worth bothering with.

Haha if every woman act like Hepburn in this movie, I hope there'll be more misogyny----Mr. Higgins taught her well and gave her such a great English education without charging any fees, provided her free housing, free food(including chocolates everyday), free clothes, took her to high-class place, why the f**k is she throwing tantrums? Yes maybe the professor was only caring about his bet instead of Hepburn's feeling,but so what? Did the professor owe her anything? Did he have any social responsibility for her? Yes Mr. Higgins trained her in a very harsh manners but did he rest while training her? Wasn't the reason that Hepburn came to Mr. Higgins' house for a proper English oral education and he perfectly accomplished the mission with extra benefits provided? What more should she ask for? Another character in a movie that gives me the strong urge to punch her in the face. Her father was really stupidly annoying as well. I feel very emotionally connected with Mr. Higgins, he's a typical man who just wants women to think with logic, yet he's misunderstood as being unkind to Hepburn.

I'll be like him too under his situation. 3, I wanna justify for Marilyn Monroe since some people complain why Audrey Hepburn is less discussed about comparing to Marilyn Monroe, when Hepburn is also a much nicer person in real life. Look, as a movie watcher, I don't give a fish about how nice you are in real life, I only care about your screen performance.

The story follows a sports agent named Jerry whose life is inadvertently turned upside down when he decides to write a manifesto describing how his fellow sports agents really act behind closed doors. And so begins the journey of Jerry Maguire. The acting is uniformly excellent across the board starting with a very down-to-earth performance from Tom Cruise as the title character Jerry. This character isn't necessarily unlike any of his previous characters. He starts out as basically a jerk before evolving into a sweet, caring individual. The thing that I believe sets his character of Jerry apart from the others that he's played, is the fact that he's actually acting like a real human being and not just some random drone that the writer created. He breathes life into Jerry in a way that I'm not sure another actor could have. I'm not the only one who thinks this either - Cruise was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance. Of course, Jerry would not be who he is throughout the movie without the help of his co- worker Dorothy Boyd who is played with a very sweet girl-next-door quality by Renee Zellwegger. I'm usually not a fan of hers, but for the first time in her career she showed me something that was very similar to that of Tom Cruise...she was able to create a fully rounded 100% human being who is very relatable. She's a single mother who carries herself very independently. She's not necessarily supremely confident in her actions, but she's definitely learned throughout the years of raising her son on her own that she doesn't really need anyone in her life except her son. At least that's what she thought. The final member of the cast to really make a lasting impact is Cuba Gooding Jr. who plays Rod Tidwell - a Wide Receiver for the Arizona Cardinals and Jerry's sole remaining client. This is a man who only wants to provide a great living for his family and against all odds he believes that Jerry Maguire is the man who can bring him to that promise land. That belief is heard loud and clear in one of the movies most talked about scenes where Rod and Jerry are on the phone together and Jerry is trying to persuade Rod into keeping him as his agent. Rod It's something very personal, a very important thing. Hell! It's a family motto. Are you ready Jerry? I wanna make sure you're ready, brother. Here it is Show me the money. Show! Me! The! Money! Jerry, it is such a pleasure to say that! Say it with me one time, Jerry. Jerry Show you the money. Rod No, no. You can do better than that! I want you to say it brother with meaning! Hey, I got Bob Sugar on the other line I bet you he can say it! Jerry Yeah, yeah, no, no, no. Show you the money. Rod No! Not show you! Show me the money! This conversation alone shows just how much of a report Jerry and Rod have together and that report is exactly the reason why Rod decides to stick with Jerry as his agent. The conversation also proves that Rod Tidwell is also, just like Jerry and just like Dorothy, a complete 100% human being and it's Cuba Gooding's performance that proves it. He was also nominated for an Academy Award and he won for his performance. The beauty of Jerry Maguire and the thing that makes it so watchable is the fact that it's a very human story with very relatable characters. That's the main thing I look for in a movie...even if it has an extremely predictable story and a predictable outcome - the movie can overcome all of that as long as it has those relatable characters for us to follow along on this journey with. Over the years Jerry Maguire has also kind of taken its place among pop culture lore. Some of its quotes are still used today by several people around the world.

Producer was very clover and that's why this film was excellent build up. I haven't read anything else, just watched the film. Am proud from all actors and actress who participate in this film, good job and seems like Bess just didn't play any simple extra paper, but she acquire a very important part in the movie.Clues for the answer, watch the movie and check who was Bess and her history also what really she wanted(she wasn't interested in K-Pass). Remember about the quote I know who you are; By Bess.
