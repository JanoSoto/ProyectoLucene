IT SIMPLY WOULD NOT HAPPEN. The construction industry has the highest accident and fatality rate of all industries in the western world and would no more allow a child on-site than - a dragon. In London, England; where this is supposed to have taken place, there is a clearly advertised rule 'No Hat, No Boots, No Job.' It refers to safety clothing, and the sack if you're caught without them. The same also applies to reflective tunics. And yet this kid is not only free to roam in flagrant breach of this fundamental safety rule; he is allowed into the deep excavation unsupervised on the lift. Gimme a break. Those involved would be sacked on the spot. And all this, apparently at the discretion of his own mother. She is down the hole, working as some kind of supervisory bod in the 'power-female' role that has now become mandatory in today's movies no matter how daft the circumstances (anyone ever seen a woman on a construction site? Does Jimmy Choo make a range of stiletto safety boots?). Further; his evident familiarity with the site and its personnel make it clear that such forays are regular and considered normal. This is so ridiculous, and demonstrates such a complete lack of the most basic research of the real world that - for me - the movie as good as ends here. It is already too fantastic to bother watching.Still; one perseveres. After a great gout of fire and the shadowy outline of one dragon, the world comes to an abrupt end. We see nothing of it. An apparent airborne battle between beasties and helicopter gunships over the skies of London, alluded to in the publicity shots never arises. It's just a cheap, shabby con. Instead, we enter a post-apocalyptic world of ash and spoil-heaps, with belligerent groups of loud-mouthed survivors and all of the weary-worn predictable clichés entailed. About the only thing missing is Arthur Scargill.It's boring. It's dull. Situations have reversed; now dragons rule the surface world and humans live in caverns. Lighting is so gloomy that it might as well have been filmed in black & white. The dragons apparently eat ash, but what do humans eat? A small garden of what look like tomatoes surely won't go very far. Where's the protein coming from? Once again we're left guessing because the director didn't stop to think. The young boy (his irresponsible mum got killed in the excavation) is now a grown man and leader, in an idea clearly ripped-off from the 'Terminator' franchise.The Brits bicker and argue until Yanks come to the rescue. Hooray for the Yanks. The Yanks have tanks, but as usual they prove useless. These dragons are worse than the Taliban. Apparently, our transatlantic heroes use helicopters, sky-divers and nets to catch the beasties in-flight, in an idea so utterly absurd that it could only have been included for the sake of a bit of cheap aerial drama. They've also discovered that almost every dragon is female (no surprises there then), and that just one male services them all. How did they discover this? Don't ask. How did they come to be so numerous so quickly in the first place then? Again; don't ask. But bump-off this flying Lothario and humanity is home and dry. The species will just die out.Well, not necessarily so. A species that evolved with just one seed-carrier would never have survived without an evolutionary contingency. And many reptiles have one. They can change gender. By simply altering the temperature at which eggs incubate, the sex of hatchlings can be manipulated - a phenomenon made manifest in 'Jurassic Park'. So think again.However, in this movie it works, and that's that. There's so much to criticise and so little to praise. Let me at least say that I like the dragons. As a piece of CGI hokum they are very nicely realised, both in the air and on the ground. It looks as if they're were the big money got spent. Beyond them, you rummage through the rubble. This movie could have been a corker. We might have at least glimpsed the reptilian take-over. Jumbo-jets attacked in flight, cruise-liners beset at sea, the great cities of the world under siege. But that would beg the question - how did we lose? With such extensive arsenals of smart weaponry throughout the world, and such huge, comparatively slow-moving targets; it should have been a turkey-shoot. Apart from that, lighting is poor, acting is wooden, and the script is banal. Editing is also a little haphazard. 'Reign Of Fire' is what happens when you put an idea with great cinematic potential into the hands of a shallow dimwit who focuses on effects and predictable drama rather than story and research. Perhaps he was hampered by a limited budget. But not half so much as by a lack of common sense.Very disappointing. Worth a watch, but not a purchase.

But unfortunately.. It wasn't ! I'm nuts about the main idea. (Hugh Jackman) here is kind of actual prince charming. He is also the elevator's inventor, so he has both heart and brains (and in Jackman's case muscles too). As for representing the lost romance and chivalry it's the perfect character, and when you push him into the future (aka  our world) then it's the perfect idea. However the world of this movie was very scanty.Mainly look at the dramatic conflict, in fact there isn't one ! Since (Meg Ryan)'s boyfriend left her from the start, so filling for the dashing, handsome, well-bred, mugger- chaser inventor would be not only easy but basically axiomatic. So, is it about the endless ironies between the old age and the new age's technology ? No, since the movie summarized it in brief sequence. So, is it about the deep irony between romantic age and phony materialistic one ? Maybe but they did it simply through the making of the TV commercial. It looked like another kind of angel-in-our-house movies where one visitor gives ultimate happiness to his troubled hosts then leaves. But did that fit whether the comic or the romantic part ?? I think wholly NOT.You'd feel hastiness. Although the main irony is super for sure but the movie's ironies weren't. The comedy was careless, I can't remember one good ironic situation. The dialog was a crime as totally unfunny and untalented, except for the monologue of (Liev Schreiber) at the hospital which was philosophically well put but surpassed anything had been written for any other character and just exposed with its high level all the low level of the rest of the dialog ! I didn't feel the love story between the title's characters, or the urge of that being impossible. All what was there just light touches that didn't convince me like the swift story of the unseen lonely neighbor, the love story of the lead's brother (that we witnessed on the phone ??), the concept of capturing the time or else, because this criminally remiss script just wasted it all. Look at what seemed as brilliant situations like the stopping of all the world's elevators, despite the imaginative spirit the script didn't go with it to anywhere so what about this unique romance between 2 persons from 2 ages?. Therefore the ending was too happy and too dreamy to fabricated extent without much of details or difficulties. So as a whole it went astray without strong feelings or good meanings. And the romance eventually looked superficial.Director (James Mangold) was executing a bland TV episode. I felt fake tenderness from him. Especially when the only romantic scene (the waltz) was just accumulated well-arranged shoots without effective sensations. Yes, the cinematography and the warm lighting were a bit emotional at that scene but the complete atmosphere was so unimpressionable.This can't compete with (Meg Ryan)'s nice legacy of romantic comedies. Originally it can't compete with the standard of its idea or even its own title as a movie about (Kate) and (Leopold) ! It was really ambitious one that promised something like what an old classic movie would present about memorable couple, but this movie delivered nothing.The 2 leads were like 2 clever dancers without music or a dance. It was pathetic to watch shinning stars like them, with possible chemistry into movie that's suffering of self-induced abortion ! In the case of (Jackman) the type of the role was attractive yet not the role in particular. (Ryan) didn't give us anything new since the script didn't give her anything ! It's the bad paradox of having productive people through unproductive work.I hated (Schreiber), despite whatever he could reach he got nothing to do with a romantic comedy, let alone being younger than (Meg Ryan). I hated dealing with Sting's masterpiece (Until) which had been nominated for an Oscar by putting it only at the closing credits plus not even using its fascinating tones into the movie's music score the way (John Williams) did in (Sabrina)'s soundtrack with another Sting's masterpiece (Moonlight). I liked (Meg)'s chic clothes, that was cuter than the movie itself ! I'm sad to say it but as a romantic comedy it lacks romance and comedy, or misses them. It was all out of keeping with Sting's (Until) which was more masterly than the whole thing. It's devastating to hear it and imagine a better movie for it !

I think wholly NOT.You'd feel hastiness. Although the main irony is super for sure but the movie's ironies weren't. The comedy was careless, I can't remember one good ironic situation. The dialog was a crime as totally unfunny and untalented, except for the monologue of (Liev Schreiber) at the hospital which was philosophically well put but surpassed anything had been written for any other character and just exposed with its high level all the low level of the rest of the dialog ! I didn't feel the love story between the title's characters, or the urge of that being impossible. All what was there just light touches that didn't convince me like the swift story of the unseen lonely neighbor, the love story of the lead's brother (that we witnessed on the phone ??), the concept of capturing the time or else, because this criminally remiss script just wasted it all. Look at what seemed as brilliant situations like the stopping of all the world's elevators, despite the imaginative spirit the script didn't go with it to anywhere so what about this unique romance between 2 persons from 2 ages?. Therefore the ending was too happy and too dreamy to fabricated extent without much of details or difficulties. So as a whole it went astray without strong feelings or good meanings. And the romance eventually looked superficial.Director (James Mangold) was executing a bland TV episode. I felt fake tenderness from him. Especially when the only romantic scene (the waltz) was just accumulated well-arranged shoots without effective sensations. Yes, the cinematography and the warm lighting were a bit emotional at that scene but the complete atmosphere was so unimpressionable.This can't compete with (Meg Ryan)'s nice legacy of romantic comedies. Originally it can't compete with the standard of its idea or even its own title as a movie about (Kate) and (Leopold) ! It was really ambitious one that promised something like what an old classic movie would present about memorable couple, but this movie delivered nothing.The 2 leads were like 2 clever dancers without music or a dance. It was pathetic to watch shinning stars like them, with possible chemistry into movie that's suffering of self-induced abortion ! In the case of (Jackman) the type of the role was attractive yet not the role in particular. (Ryan) didn't give us anything new since the script didn't give her anything ! It's the bad paradox of having productive people through unproductive work.I hated (Schreiber), despite whatever he could reach he got nothing to do with a romantic comedy, let alone being younger than (Meg Ryan). I hated dealing with Sting's masterpiece (Until) which had been nominated for an Oscar by putting it only at the closing credits plus not even using its fascinating tones into the movie's music score the way (John Williams) did in (Sabrina)'s soundtrack with another Sting's masterpiece (Moonlight). I liked (Meg)'s chic clothes, that was cuter than the movie itself ! I'm sad to say it but as a romantic comedy it lacks romance and comedy, or misses them. It was all out of keeping with Sting's (Until) which was more masterly than the whole thing. It's devastating to hear it and imagine a better movie for it !

But unfortunately.. It wasn't ! I'm nuts about the main idea. (Hugh Jackman) here is kind of actual prince charming. He is also the elevator's inventor, so he has both heart and brains (and in Jackman's case muscles too). As for representing the lost romance and chivalry it's the perfect character, and when you push him into the future (aka  our world) then it's the perfect idea. However the world of this movie was very scanty.Mainly look at the dramatic conflict, in fact there isn't one ! Since (Meg Ryan)'s boyfriend left her from the start, so filling for the dashing, handsome, well-bred, mugger- chaser inventor would be not only easy but basically axiomatic. So, is it about the endless ironies between the old age and the new age's technology ? No, since the movie summarized it in brief sequence.

That just shows the power of relationships in film.Say Anything... is about those two characters, played by John Cusack and Ione Skye, an unlikely couple that forms out of a desire to make the most of what little time they both have at home before entering the real world. Their chemistry is simply fantastic in being both natural and believable. Things aren't so straightforward in love, however, and the bright future on Diane's horizon and her very close relationship with her father (John Mahoney) complicate things with Lloyd.Lloyd and Diane seem perfect, and the secret is that Lloyd's a little neurotic and Diane is the smart girl that thinks no one cares about her and their union is representative of how both get what they want despite their self-perceptions.

His own father did the same for him and Chet has many a happy memory of good times in the great outdoors. He tells his two boys that they will love boating, water skiing, and hiking. But, surprise, surprise, Chet's brother, Roman, decides to crash the party, bringing his own wife (Annette Bening) and twin daughters. Feeling he can't turn his sibling away, both families settle into the cabin and begin the fun. This includes special moments like Chet getting the ride of his life on water skiis, thanks to Roman's speeding boat, and the battle of the bat when one of those flying creature comes calling inside the rustic lodgings. Chet also loves to spook the others with stories about giant bears in this part of the nation. But, there may be some secrets harbored by both Chet and Roman while the youngsters find new ways to enjoy themselves, including getting lost in the woods. Will the Great Outdoors prove a place to sprout good or bad memories? This is a fun film, not great, but entertaining nonetheless. The plot is, for the most part, a series of city boy learns a lesson in the wild episodes, which is fine but not overly creative or intriguing. However, the two stars, Ackroyd and Candy, make up for any deficiencies with their great comic abilities. The rest of the cast, including Bening and Robert Prosky, is fine also. One of the best features of the film is the lovely scenery in the northern woods while the costumes and photography are nice as well. All in all, this is quite a fun movie for families who are ready to laugh and slap their thighs, without any heavy lessons.

She not only impinges on the lives of Brooks and his family. She takes them over.She has demanding tastes, grows quickly bored with the suite at the Four Seasons that Brooks is paying for. She has a whim of iron, sending Brooks out for Waldorf salad from Spago in the middle of the night. She's friendly towards Brooks' wife and urges her to begin the commercial cookie-making career that she's discarded over the years. MacDowell follows Stone's advice and finds self-fulfillment before the oven.Meanwhile, Brooks is going nuts. He's spending money and time keeping Sharon Stone satisfied but he's getting very little inspiration out of her. An occasional, off-the-cuff suggestion -- that's all. Brooks develops a script based on her hints but reaches a block at the end of Act II, with his protagonist owning an aquarium and nowhere else to go. He presses her abjectly for an idea and she suggests that, since they must use drilling equipment to build the foundation for the aquarium, why not have them strike oil? Right out of The Beverley Hillbillies.In the end, Stone turns out to be not a muse but a multiple personality who has escaped from a private psychiatric hospital in Ohio. Last time out, she was Picasso's daughter. Brooks of course is a neural shambles by now, but -- Lo -- Paramount buys his script and everything is fine -- except that the producer at Paramount turns out to be Sharon Stone in another disguise.There are a lot of cameos in the film, some easily recognizable, others not -- from Wolfgang Puck to Martin Scorsese who does a hilarious turn as himself, planning a remake of Raging Bull, only this time the guy is really THIN. You see it? Can you see it? Scorsese speaks faster than a normal person can think.Overall, it's mildly amusing, and that's about it. Nothing wrong with the professional players. Brooks is the anxiety-ridden middle-class character that he's perfected by now. Sharon Stone is seasoned. Andy MacDowell is beguiling. But the script is full of logical holes. This is okay in a comic fantasy, in itself, but there are so many of them here that they become noticeable. We can contrast The Muse with a comedy like Groundhog Day to illustrate when I mean. In Groundhog Day, with an equally preposterous premise, one thing follows inexorably from what has happened before, so the film DEVELOPS. That sense of inexorability is lacking here.

And, shortly after she escapes from the doctors who have come to fetch her back to the institution, how does she suddenly show up as a producer at Paramount? It's good for a laugh but nothing has set the situation up, so it's a shallow chuckle rather than the conclusion of any plot thread.

So asks Samuel L. Jackson in Renny Harlin's stupendous thriller Deep Blue Sea. Franklin is one of seven people trapped beneath the ocean's surface. One of them has already died, and three unnaturally brilliant sharks are eager for more. The undersea laboratory is flooding, and wherever the water travels the sharks can follow.The movie opens when an escaped experimental shark attacks a 25 foot boat. The two couples aboard are saved from becoming fish chow at the last moment. The resulting publicity gives primary investor Russell Franklin (Jackson) cold feet about the safety of his money. He gives the scientists one final chance, and he needs to be present to satisfy his mind.Dr. Susan McCallister (a mildly de-beautified Saffron Burrows) is attempting to harvest enzymes found in shark brains for human benefit. Unfortunately, she can produce enough enzyme volume only by increasing the size of the three sharks' brains. When a medical emergency arises, the sharks seize their opportunity to breach the inner part of the facility. The survivors are Franklin, McCallister, Carter Blake (Thomas Jane), a shark wrangler; Jan Higgins (Jacqueline McKenzie), the medical assistant; Tom Scoggins (Michael Rapaport), the facility engineer; and Sherman Dudley (LL Cool J), the chef.One trait that elevates Deep Blue Sea above nearly every other hunter-and-hunted movie is its cleverness. The closest anybody comes to stupid is when they spend too much time looking at cracking glass. Harlin and the three writers never contrive situations for extra effect. We are warned about the risks each new area holds. Both the places the humans go and effects of the sharks' destruction are entirely reasonable and believable. When falling debris burns Carter's arm, he must bandage it to prevent his dripping blood from endangering the whole group.

After all, by 1956, Marilyn Monroe was a bona fide star, having appeared in such blockbusters as GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES, THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH, RIVER OF NO RETURN and HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE, so you would have expected 20th Century Fox to pull out all the stops with BUS STOP. However, despite some decent reviews, the film was a terrible mess due to a poor script and one performance in particular.The biggest fault with the movie isn't Marilyn's overly broad performance but Don Murray's. Her acting was bad--no question about it. However, his overacting not only overshadowed Miss Monroe's shortcomings in her role, but really grated on my nerves. No young man can be THAT naive when it comes to women or when it comes to leaving their home--and that would even include Mowgli from THE JUNGLE BOOK! His performance (if you want to call it that) is more akin to having Jethro Bodine play the role!! It was that ridiculously overplayed and unsubtle. Murray, of course, can be blamed for much of this. However, I assume the film had a director (though it's not obvious) and someone had to write this drivel. You really have to see it to believe it. However, I am not the only one who thinks this about Murray in this film. One reviewer describes him as acting as if he escaped from a mental hospital and is off his medication!! Another said they wanted to shoot him in the head! In hindsight, I guess I'm being pretty kind with my review.Now I am going to admit something that I very rarely do with films. For probably only the second or third time out of over 5300 reviews that I simply couldn't finish watching the film--Murray's character was THAT irritating. That's pretty bad--especially considering all the Ed Wood, Jr., Ray Dennis Steckler and Al Adamson films I have seen!

However at the same time they is something strangely compelling when watching film.The story of the film is an international peace-keeping force is sent to a fictional country in South-East Asia. This force is led by Colonel William Guile (Jean-Claude Van Damme (a bad Beligan actor playing an American)). His mission is to help stabilise the nation after the overthrow of the director M. Bison. Bison has an evil plan to regain power of the country and then world dominion. He kidnaps civilians and he demands $20 Million and all the Allied Nations forces to leave the country in 2 days or he would start killing them. Instead of giving in, Guile leads his forces to fight back against the villain, like the American hero that he is. Ryo and Ken are involved as well, but they are con-men in this film, who are involved in the underground fighting scene before getting involved with Bison. Blanka is also in this film as a part of Bison's evil plan, where he hopes to make to super-soldiers that would help him on his quest.There are a lot of problems with this film it is poorly written and directed.

His brother is a wildly unstable criminal, and he crosses paths with some angry people in the dog-fighting underworld as well.The flaw with this section is that everybody is so animalistic and savage, you don't care what happens with any of them.In this movement, the dog kills to support a human's love.The second movement features a man who leaves his family for a super-model, but when she has an accident and deteriorates, it snaps the superficial bonds between them.The flaw here is that once again, you don't care much for such superficial, empty people.In this movement, a man puts his priorities back in order after a near fatality, symbolized by his finally attempting to save a dog trapped and dying under his floorboards.The third movement tells the tale of a crusty extremist revolutionary, now a wino-cum-hired assassin who longs for his family and daughter again.This is by far the best episode with immense depth of character and deserves to be in its own movie.In this movement, a killer dog mirrors the man's ruined, violent life and awakens him to find redemption and humanity again.The much talked about Pulp Fiction-like structure is used very well, showing us a God-like view of a pivotal accident and how it changes lives both before and after the event.Summary Both intensely fascinating and unsatisfying, more authentic than Magnolia but not as cohesive.

'How to Marry a Millionaire' comes prefaced by an apparently random five minute orchestral performance of 'Street Scene', a Gershwin-lite piece treated with the full pomp and ceremony of, well, Gershwin. Sitting through it takes some patience. If you have the DVD, rest assured, you can skip forward. You won't miss anything.The film itself is one of the perpetual disappointments of 50's Hollywood, a movie so bolstered by major star-power, opulent mise-en-scene and perfect high-concept that failure seems inconceivable. The title alone is perfect. Generation after generation, however, are forced to ask themselves - how is this so limp? The script is an albatross about the production's neck, a dead, smelling thing that chokes everything and everyone before they can really spark to life. There are no comic situations, just isolated moments that play for laughs. Whenever an actual comedy scene threatens to develop, the movie quickly moves on to other, less interesting things. A case in point - the scene where the three leading ladies each bring a date to the same fancy restaurant. One of them, short-sighted, refuses to wear her spectacles out of vanity. One of the dates is married. A classic Hollywood farce set-up, surely, complete with mistaken identity, angry wife, and probably a pie in the face for somebody? Well, no. Instead, we cut between the three dates as the ladies react 'comically' to things their partners say. Hit the punchline, and cut to the next limp joke. If in doubt, have Marilyn walk into a wall. Where's Billy Wilder when you need him?The three stars are almost a perfect diagram of the life cycle of the classic Hollywood screen goddess. This was one of Marilyn Monroe's breakout films, and the camera just eats her up, even though the script gives her nothing to do. She's so luminescent she almost seems newly hatched. Lauren Bacall, on the other hand, had been a major star for nearly a full decade, and she knows how to dominate the screen even when in frame with Monroe. She gets the only thing passing for a real role, and delivers the few good lines with a cynical snap - given the right material, she could have brought this thing to life. She's a curiously ageless actress - when she lies about her age in the film and claims to be forty, it isn't instantly ridiculous - and far less girlish than her co-stars, giving her a convincing authority. Betty Grable was far from ageless, and had a good eight years on her co-stars, putting her near the end of her Hollywood career. There's an air of desperation about her at times, stranded on screen with nothing but a toothpaste smile and a few scraps of comic timing, unable to play her real age but fooling no-one as a contemporary of this new, sharper generation of actresses, relying on the same old schtick that had served her throughout her career (for Marilyn-doubters, seeing the two juxtaposed in this movie helps to throw Monroe's subtlety and - yes - intelligence into sharp relief). She's also lumbered with the dead wood in terms of male co-stars (although all of the men - even the great William Powell - are guilty of lazy performances); she's unable to strike any comic sparks off them. Better to have given her role to the under-utilised Monroe, who could be funny all by herself, and left Grable with the repetitive Mr. Magoo routine.That the movie is as enjoyable as it is can be put down to the luscious Hollywood production, the sort that renders even the twee likes of 'By the Light of the Silvery Moon' watchable. But somewhere, buried beneath the flabby jokes and professionalism, lies the rough outline of a sharp, cynical comedy about the business of marriage that Bacall could have made sing - and new generations of movie viewers will sit down with 'How to Marry a Millionaire' in expectation of that movie, ready to be disappointed all over again.
