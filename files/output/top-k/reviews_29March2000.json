Lucas's Star Wars movies have always had a certain charm and look to them that no other movies in Hollywood history have. Obviously, I was excited to see the new one and when the lights dimmed and the 20th century Fox logo beamed on to the screen, My heart started beating and I admit it, I felt like crying. The kid in me came out and it felt good. As the movie went on, I just got more excited and thrilled by what I was gonna see next. The podrace made my hair stand up on end. It was fun. The sights to behold in this movie are very brash and daring. One thing you can say about this movie is that it has to be one of the most epic looking movies ever. From planet to planet. You see three lush worlds and all there splendor. The feeling this movie gives off is pleasant. I felt like I wanted to walk into every scene. A few scenes here and there did give off a bit of digital vibe, but hopefully over time, The aging of the film print will make the effects look more settled in. The music of course, From John Williams is top notch.After I left the theater, I felt like I had been taken on the most fantastic ride in movie history. I couldn't stop thinking about it. It's amazing, The best movie in the history of mankind! Well, needless to say, I got carried away and let the overwhelming excitement of seeing a new Star Wars movie after 16 years, Get to me. After the dust settled. On my third viewing. I saw with clearer eyes. Now, I have to be honest folks. The acting in this movie is wooden. Except for Obi won, (Ewan McGregor), Who seemed to play his part right on target. Natalie Portman, Oh beautiful, sweet Natalie.(Queen Amidala), I wanted to love every line she said, but I couldn't. She did have a few good lines though that I thought were well delivered. (Jake Lloyd),  Anakin came off like a boy who dropped in on the Star Wars film set and was amazed to be there. Probably, because he was. His lines were all forced. Except when he says good-bye to his Mom, He pulled that off. Anakin, In this film comes off as shallow and kind ofmean. He feels like a showoff, but I guess it works. It is the future Darth Vader after all. Qui-Gon(Liam Neeson)looks great on screen, but he doesn't say one memorable line.I can't stress it enough, The performances were very wooden. Now, if you were around in 77 and saw Star Wars. Believe it or not you got that feeling from a lot of the actors in that movie as well. They were virtual unknowns. It's just that seeing those effects and that universe at that time was something fresh and knew. So we forgave them. Over the years you see the movie so much on TV and on tape. That you get used to the dialogue. That could happen with Episode 1. Who knows. Jar Jar binks, I didn't hate this guy for some reason. He didn't come off as annoying at all, but he did come off as kinda like, Who cares. I think people found him an easy target and used him as a good excuse to use in order to hate the film. His acting was cheesy indeed, but you have to also remember that this is Star Wars and it's not supposed to be Hamlet. It's all in fun. You have to keep the kids in mind too. My biggest complaint about Episode 1, is Anakin destroying the control ship. How many times can a pilot go into a ship or space station and destroy it from the inside out in a Star Wars movie? I thought that was unimaginative on Lucas's part.Episode 1 is the toughest of the three new episodes to make. It's the one that's most disconnected from the original three. Times were different in Episode 1. The universe was more spoiled and rich and times were grand. It look like Dinotopia, but my point is that people wanted it to feel and look like the original Star Wars movies. Stormtroopers, Xwings, but that wasn't there. The next episodes should start to slowly show how the empire takes over and times become darker. Rebels are forced to make ships from scrap and rebellions are formed.  Episode 1 is what it is. Accept it. Over time it will take it's place in Star Wars history. Backlash or no backlash. It's part of one big long 14 hour movie with 6 episodes.

The Sixth Sense is of the latter category. I saw the trailers, thought it looked stupid - not just because of the presence of Bruce Willis, but just because it didn't look interesting. Then it started getting critical raves, and I figured what the hell, I'll give it a shot. Boy am I glad I did.I only have one major major problem with the film The ending. I have an uncanny ability to sniff out twist endings from a mile away (The Usual Suspects didn't fool me for a second) and this one's no different. Okay, I'll admit I had the ending spoiled for me ) but even if I hadn't, the subtle clues are so blatantly obvious I'm surpised no one else got it...it seems to me like the first time you see Willis and Cole's mom sitting together (like 10 minutes into the film), it should be a simple matter of connecting the dots.

Frankly, I thought it was a bit of an insult to my intelligence. But the director (sorry I can't remember his last name) seems like a very smart guy, and I keep having images of him arguing with studio executives, telling him Oh, you have to add so and so, make it more obvious... and he finally caves in and does it.But that doesn't matter, because the rest of the film is fantastic. It had a few really really scary parts (the sick girl comes to mind) but it wasn't terrifying like everyone says. Blair Witch kept me up a lot more. But it's a very intelligent film, with a good script, creepy score, and kind of understated direction (which is a good thing). What really pulls it all together are the performances Bruce Willis is genuinely good. He still tends to be a little monotonous, but he shows a lot more emotion and range than, say, Die Hard. Toni Collette was excellent as well. But little Haley Joel Osment...wow! I am truly in awe of his performance. I still think the Supporting Actor category should've been his by a long shot. It would be an amazing performance by an adult, but to come out of an 11-year old boy...wow! The scene towards the end of him and his mom in the car truly had me choking up. And the creepiest scene in the movie doesn't even involve ghosts it's simply Haley Joel's monologue in the hospital bed about seeing dead people. The expression on his face, his barely-a-whisper delivery, the faintest hints of tears at the corners of his eyes...it sent shivers up my spine, and trailer clips simply do not do the scene justice.All in all a great movie. American Beauty was the only best picture nominee that actually deserved to be nominated in the first place. Cider House Rules? Come on...I could make a list of better movies from 1999, but I won't.

Compared to VERTIGO, where every loose end and ambiguity only leads one into an interpretive labyrinth, each piece of REAR WINDOW's puzzle seems to fit; there is little room for doubt.  Interpretations are variations on two themes - a critique of voyeurism; and an investigation into heterosexual relationships (critics have been quick to pounce on the paralells between the Thorwalds and Jeffries and Lisa, their names all begin with 'L'), and the film is probably the best we have on both these subjects.But, like Peter Wollen, I see Hitchcock as primarily a Surrealist, and read this way, we can return to the film all the ambiguity and doubt proper to Hitch's artistry.  The film is about playing God.  Two gods, the director and the lead character.  It is important to note the difference, and Hitchcock does very clearly, because it is the disparity between the two that calls into question the very reality of the film itself.Although the film we are about to watch concerns assault, murder, loneliness, attempted rape, and modern alienation, it opens with a score of uncommon jauntiness.  Three blinds go up one by one, not by human hand, revealing the view from the rear window, the field of the film's play.  The camera then travels through this field, introducing us briefly to the secondary characters and environs before finally bringing us to our hero, LB Jeffries, asleep on his chair.This opening sequence is crucial in two ways.  Firstly, the majority of the film's action arises from motivation inspired by Jeff's point of view.  He sees a certain action, he interprets it, and the other characters act accordingly.  He is a godlike character, in classic Hollywood close-up, while the little people he watches are boxed in their little lives like TV sets.  He can even create people; before we even meet Lisa, he has provided us with a detailed picture of her, that she seems to conform to pretty well. He sees all, like God, and no-one can see him.Except, of course, he doesn't.  This opening sequence has already shown us things he hasn't seen.  He is frequently missing important plot elements, through sleep, or watching someone else, or being bothered by Lisa.  The sleep thing is important.  Notice how many scenes begin with Jeff waking up, or how the climactic events, which fulfil his every prediction, takes place at night.  Notice the repetition and circularity in the film, how certain scenes, patterns, motifs, colours return (eg. Lisa turning on the three lights), like signposts in a dream.  Look at how a man in a cast, powerless, impotent (unable to even uncork a wine bottle) grows in power, turns two sensible independent women into his pawns.Notice how Thorwald is his doppelganger, not an evil Other, how when he looks at Thorwald he sees himself, how Thorwald's window reflects on his lens, how the final struggle is less between good and evil, than an existential conflict of the self.  Note the pattern of Jeff's viewing, especially the correlation between Miss Torso and the Thorwalds, he always turns from one to the other.  Miss Torso represents sex, Jeff's lust; the Thorwalds death - the two are inseperable in his mind, especially when you consider Lisa compared Miss Torso's loneliness to her own.Watch how the views across the street are less those of independent characters, than projections of Jeff's desire or anxiety - watch how each one seem to match his state of mind.  Is it far-fetched to suggest that the whole film is Jeff's dream?Even if you reject this extreme interpretation, Hitchcock's ironies are masterly.  Jeff is a man whose career is to travel the world, who is a war hero, and yet is not only confined to a cast, but is forced to confront the notion of home, of melodrama, of the lives of 'ordinary' people who have to stay put and do the same thing day in day out.  When you think about it, most of what happens across the street is the stuff of cheap novelette - Jeff obviously doesn't read very much (or else he wouldn't be spying) - haven't we all imagined scenarios for people we see on buses etc.What about Jeff's fear of sex, his pleasure in onanism (figured in his continuous need to scratch)?  Or, one of the most beautiful scenes in all Hitchcock (i.e. cinema), the kiss, where the film slows down, and the story becomes a momentary fairy tale, operating on a different temporal level, out of time - Jeff's problem is that he has too much time, too much of the same time.  Hitchcock never features in the group of great 1950s melodramatists, but surely his subversion of the crime genre, and masculinity, is every bit as melodramatic as Minnelli or Ray.The film, as well as sensing, years before Antonioni, urban alienation, also reveals the fears of men with no more wars to fight or Wests to win, and must stay at home, like women have always had to.  Jeff's real pain is that Lisa is independent, mobile, earning as much, if not more, than him, and refuses to kowtow.  Far from being a misogynist, as is his reputation, Hitchcock always shows how silly men are.(Oh yeah, I forgot.  It's a brilliant thriller too - I've seen the film a dozen times, and still get breathless and sweaty when Lisa goes into Thorwald's apartment.

He can even create people; before we even meet Lisa, he has provided us with a detailed picture of her, that she seems to conform to pretty well. He sees all, like God, and no-one can see him.Except, of course, he doesn't.  This opening sequence has already shown us things he hasn't seen.  He is frequently missing important plot elements, through sleep, or watching someone else, or being bothered by Lisa.  The sleep thing is important.  Notice how many scenes begin with Jeff waking up, or how the climactic events, which fulfil his every prediction, takes place at night.  Notice the repetition and circularity in the film, how certain scenes, patterns, motifs, colours return (eg. Lisa turning on the three lights), like signposts in a dream.  Look at how a man in a cast, powerless, impotent (unable to even uncork a wine bottle) grows in power, turns two sensible independent women into his pawns.Notice how Thorwald is his doppelganger, not an evil Other, how when he looks at Thorwald he sees himself, how Thorwald's window reflects on his lens, how the final struggle is less between good and evil, than an existential conflict of the self.  Note the pattern of Jeff's viewing, especially the correlation between Miss Torso and the Thorwalds, he always turns from one to the other.  Miss Torso represents sex, Jeff's lust; the Thorwalds death - the two are inseperable in his mind, especially when you consider Lisa compared Miss Torso's loneliness to her own.Watch how the views across the street are less those of independent characters, than projections of Jeff's desire or anxiety - watch how each one seem to match his state of mind.  Is it far-fetched to suggest that the whole film is Jeff's dream?Even if you reject this extreme interpretation, Hitchcock's ironies are masterly.  Jeff is a man whose career is to travel the world, who is a war hero, and yet is not only confined to a cast, but is forced to confront the notion of home, of melodrama, of the lives of 'ordinary' people who have to stay put and do the same thing day in day out.  When you think about it, most of what happens across the street is the stuff of cheap novelette - Jeff obviously doesn't read very much (or else he wouldn't be spying) - haven't we all imagined scenarios for people we see on buses etc.What about Jeff's fear of sex, his pleasure in onanism (figured in his continuous need to scratch)?  Or, one of the most beautiful scenes in all Hitchcock (i.e. cinema), the kiss, where the film slows down, and the story becomes a momentary fairy tale, operating on a different temporal level, out of time - Jeff's problem is that he has too much time, too much of the same time.  Hitchcock never features in the group of great 1950s melodramatists, but surely his subversion of the crime genre, and masculinity, is every bit as melodramatic as Minnelli or Ray.The film, as well as sensing, years before Antonioni, urban alienation, also reveals the fears of men with no more wars to fight or Wests to win, and must stay at home, like women have always had to.  Jeff's real pain is that Lisa is independent, mobile, earning as much, if not more, than him, and refuses to kowtow.  Far from being a misogynist, as is his reputation, Hitchcock always shows how silly men are.(Oh yeah, I forgot.  It's a brilliant thriller too - I've seen the film a dozen times, and still get breathless and sweaty when Lisa goes into Thorwald's apartment.  And the scene, where the dead dog is discovered (the only time until the climax any of the groundlings get more than a long shot) has the best editing since THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS).

If you haven't seen it go to the very next show and be prepared for something that will knock you sideways.If you are one of the people who keeps complaining about this film, please gain some perception and taste.  I realise you are entitled to your own opinion but I just don't understand how anyone could actually dislike it. With all the sub-plots twisted together there is something that everybody should be able to relate to in some way.  Maybe its one of those love it or hate it things.The acting is amazing, and I think its terrible that none of the younger actors (particularly Wes Bentley) were nominated for an Oscar.  The images used, even if some were less than subtle, were extremely effective.  Why does something have to be original to make it work?  This deserved all the oscars it won, and a place in film history which I'm sure it will gain.
