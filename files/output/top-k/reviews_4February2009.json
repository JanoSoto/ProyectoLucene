Like Kramer v Kramer, which won the same award the previous year, it is a family drama. It is also remarkably conservative for an Oscar-winning film from such a late date. We tend to think of the late sixties and seventies as a revolutionary period in Hollywood history, a time of ground-breaking or experimental films such as The Godfather, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest or Apocalypse Now. Redford himself had acted in some of those films, such as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Ordinary People, however, harks back to the days before the cinematic revolution. It is made in what I think of as the filmed theatre style, concentrating more on dialogue than on physical action and with most of the action taking place indoors. Although it was based upon a novel rather than a stage play, it reminded me both in style and content of those Tennessee Williams adaptations such as Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, which were popular in the fifties and early sixties.The film tells the story of the Jarretts, an affluent Chicago family. As the film opens, Calvin and Beth Jarrett are trying to come to terms with the attempted suicide of their teenage son, Conrad. From Conrad's conversations with his parents, and his sessions with his psychiatrist Dr Berger, we learn that his suicide attempt was motivated by a sense of guilt stemming from his involvement in a sailing accident in which his elder brother Buck was killed. Even before the accident, Conrad suffered from feelings of inferiority towards Buck, who was a gifted scholar and athlete and clearly his parents' favourite. Beth, in particular, makes little secret of the fact that she preferred her older son. The tensions in the family eventually lead to the breakdown of Beth and Calvin's marriage, but Calvin and Conrad are able to reach out and forgive one another. The film has some similarities with Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, which also ends with a father-son reconciliation. In that film too the son has been troubled by guilt feelings stemming from a death, in that case the suicide of a close friend.Although this style of film-making may have seemed out of tune with the seventies Zeitgeist, there were occasionally some good examples from that decade, such as Robert Mulligan's Same Time, Next Year from 1978, and Redford here shows that the style has some solid virtues. It can be an excellent way of making films which concentrate on character, psychology or human relationships, which rely on good writing and acting rather than on spectacle, and Redford is here well served by his actors. The casting of Mary Tyler Moore as Beth was inspired. She was, of course, best known as an actress in television sit-coms, but her character here is essentially a sit-com character who suddenly finds herself in a serious drama. When tragedy hits her family, Beth goes on behaving as though she were the perfect all-American housewife and mother from a sit-com, retreating into a world of housework and charity to avoid having to confront her emotions. As Roger Ebert put it, Beth masks her inner sterility behind a facade of cheerful suburban perfection.I have to say that I did not agree with Timothy Hutton's Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, because he was obviously playing a leading role rather than a supporting one, and was presumably nominated in this category so that he did not have to compete against the likes of Robert de Niro and John Hurt for Best Actor in a Leading Role. (Kate Winslet's recent Best Supporting Actress for her leading role in The Reader shows that this sort of manipulation is still going on). There was, however, nothing wrong with Hutton's performance, which is a fine and sensitive one, revealing the agony and grief which are destroying Conrad's life.I also liked Judd Hirsch as Dr Berger. Psychiatrists are often shown in the media either as godlike healers of the soul or as comic characters, funny little men with goatee beards, Germanic accents and an obsession with sex. Hirsch's portrayal gets away from both these stereotypes, showing Berger as an rounded human being, honest and caring but not flawless or omniscient. My favourite performance, however, came from Donald Sutherland as the agonised Calvin, desperately trying to cope with the disintegration of his family. Calvin is a flawed individual, but he has an inner strength and warmth which his wife lacks. I was very surprised that Sutherland was the only one of the four main actors who did not receive an Oscar nomination.Ordinary People would not perhaps have been my choice for Best Picture of 1980; my vote would probably have gone to The Elephant Man or Polanski's Tess. Nevertheless, it is a fine and moving, if often sombre, human drama, laying bare the tensions that can exist at the heart of even seemingly perfect families. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 February 2009","score":"","review":" There are a number of directors who have succeeded in making a masterpiece on their directorial debut; the examples who come to mind are Orson Welles (Citizen Kane), Sidney Lumet (Twelve Angry Men), Bryan Forbes (Whistle Down the Wind), Stuart Rosenberg (Cool Hand Luke), Kevin Costner (Dances with Wolves) and Sam Mendes (American Beauty).Like Costner, Robert Redford is better known as an actor than as a director, but he too had a remarkable success with the first film he directed, Ordinary People, which won the Best Picture Oscar for 1980.

In quotes are criticisms followed by my responses. I am such a fan of this film that I could not let these comments go unchecked, as it were...critique-wise. I hope you all find this engaging and informing.The main characters are absurd and their motivations make little sense. You'll have to be more specific and give examples of this if you want anyone to understand or respect this statement.The supporting cast plays characters right out of a comic-book. I'd like to know what comic books you are reading! First of all, have you ever heard of the concept of the stock character? It's only as old as theater itself. That's what these characters are and as such are not well-drawn out but predictable and flat. They serve to inform on the main characters and plot, and are to be well recognized and familiar to the audience immediately upon entrance, a la, commedia dell'Arte, Moliere, Goldoni, Shakespeare, Plautus, etc, etc, whose stock characters, I assume, you have similar misgivings, All this superficiality and absurdity wouldn't matter at all if only this were a proper comedy. Now this is a truly mystifying statement. In a proper comedy these absurdities would be, I would think, impossible, unless I misunderstand, in which case you need to provide examples from other films, plays, etc...The film plays up the near-perfection and integrity of its two main leads, but it simply doesn't wash in MacLaine's case. If she is such an angel why is she a home-wrecker who goes out with a married man with kids? Near perfection. ??? Now I feel as though we are viewing two different films. All the characters, ALL OF THEM, are severely flawed. Hence, they have depth, causing us to have sympathy with them. (Which might go a long way in explaining the popularity and high regard the film has experienced, which has escaped you for some reason.) An angel??? Of course she's no angel. She is, now hold on, a HUMAN BEING, full of flaws, and beauty, kindness, and love, cruelty and indifference.And does it have to be one of the company's top executives as well? This is simply childish. How old are you? I would guess that you did not live at the time this film was released and may be a product of the post-1960 revolution. I mean, what does this have to do with anything? You think it mattered to her who she fell for? Have you ever been in love? Would it have been more genuine if she had fallen for the janitor??? Jeez.And what's with Lemmon's character? This guy is so self-sacrificing and noble that Wilder should have had him nailed to the cross in the last scene. Example's, please, of his self-sacrifice? None that I can think of. If you're thinking of his protecting Sheldrake as self-sacrificing, well think again, my friend. As above, you do not see the flaw in Lemmon's character, very well and clearly delineated by his desire to climb up the ladder by pimping his apartment. And what of his picking up a married woman at the bar on Christmas eve. Nice? Again, were we watching different films? The basic plot outline of the film is good and there was real potential there for a terrific situation comedy, but Wilder took the easy route and turned this into a schmaltzy romance film with the Hollywood violins accompanying every schmaltzy scene. Quite the contrary the easy was would have been to create a straight comedy. Among the many reasons this film is held is such high regard (again this escapes you for some reason) is that it straddles high tragedy and low comedy, a virtually impossible feat and I defy to name another film that does so with any degree of success.FINAL NOTES I can recall seeing this film during it's initial run (yes, I'm that old). (I hate all this discussion of great films that have never been seen by the critic on the big screen--the experience is amazing and the manner in which the film improves is immeasurable). You cannot imagine the audience's reaction. Wilder had them in the palm of his hand. As the film went up, the audience went up, down, they went down. And, there was much laughter. Much more than can be achieved on a screen in one's living room...alone, which is, let's face it, how most of us watch films now.Most egregiously, you have not mentioned the performances. I cannot think of a film, let alone comedy, that contains this degree of superior acting achieved by as many actors! Here we see Lemmon at his comedic\/tragic best, McClaine, no doubt at her finest, MacMurray, cast against type, is perfect, Kruschen, (an Oscar) his (the doctor's) wife, Ray Walston, and the guys, all perfect, along with the fabulous Joan Shawlee.This film, is, in total, a masterpiece of the film-maker's craft.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"4 February 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" There is no real reason to argue that Stanley Kubrick was one of the finest directors to ever stand behind a camera. From Dr. Strangelove to 2001 A Space Odyssey to Full Metal Jacket, Kubrick was able to polarize and hypnotize the audience with his brilliant composition, camera movement, and incredible storytelling. Here, he explores the human desires to copulate and have intimacy with one another. What is interesting is that this is an issue we all know about and that the movie industry really seems to like, especially these days as practically every film made has a sex scene ore sexual reference in it. For Kubrick, he makes it more of a dream as the plot stretches off into wild and weird sections we weren't expecting and really kind of put us off in a way.As Tom Cruise's character begins to explore the sexual events that surround him throughout the night, the film feels more and more deliberately slow in pace as well as more strange in tone. I believe Kubrick is doing this intentionally in order to plunge us further in the mindset that Dr. Harford is unaware and confused of the events happening to him. That being said, it feels a bit too long and there are some scenes that don't fit with the rest. The first hour is really strong as we view the marriage bonds between the doctor and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) strain as they both face temptation. As we follow Bill into this fantasy of sexual desires and obsession, the plot gets weirder and the questions pile up. This is not to say Kubrick doesn't wrap things up but not everything is revealed.For me, this was not one of Kubrick's many masterpieces. I did admire the film for its insight on the reason of marriage and the ties it requires between two people. It also is very good in its atmosphere and set-up, which Kubrick always did well. However, I couldn't really get into it but that may be the reason behind the motives. For any Kubrick fan, this is worth checking out, but despite it not being up to his other stuff, there are definite traces of a great film here. It is only too unfortunate that he died so soon. One can only imagine what he would have done next.

The film takes on three different approaches to telling a story and criss-crosses two very different genres in order to follow that through. One third of the equation is told in flashback form of one person's meeting, consequent marriage and continuation into brief married life with another person. Additionally, Nicole Kidman's character named Suzanne Stone tells us first hand and directly into the (or 'a') camera these events that she indulged in with the other half of the relationship already described &#150; he is Matt Dillion's Larry Maretto. Kidman sits in front of a bright, blank and slightly blinding white screen, perhaps a visual representation of her conscience. Thirdly, members of Larry's family talk directly into the camera, but I get the feeling it is 'the' camera and not 'a' camera, about Suzanne and Larry's relationship in a downbeat and somewhat regretful manner that is linked to things later on.Purely from a pitch point of view, To Die For has a lot going on within it. The film is a blend between two genres I haven't had the fortune of coming across as being previously blended; Larry and Sharon's romance, marriage and story about hapless young adults getting involved whiffs of film noir. Whereas the other two components of the piece are firmly set within the realms of the documentary but with that added bite that the film has already established itself as one that will incorporate scenes during which the characters are NOT aware of the camera watching them and consequential events will be played out. On top of all this is the fact the film was based on true events anyway.I liked To Die For overall, even if I had a couple of reservations about the flicking between concepts and it is one of those films that puts its ideas across in such an off the wall and postmodernist way that it sort of blinds you as to the very basic narrative that is unravelling within this bizarre world of deceit and ruthlessness. There is a point where you realise that given what's happened to these people so far, the film really isn't going to end on a happy note.The film is a tragedy, a tragedy that does no favours for anybody and given there are three different parties involved, that's a lot of destroyed souls through an individual's greed. Kidman plays Suzanne with an odd, balanced feel to her; the sort of person who does what she does because it's just simply the clearest cut way to get to where she wants to be but she doesn't play her as necessarily someone naive. Where she wants to be is as some sort of national icon made famous through television, the sort of goal or aim that was becoming more evident it was possible to attain as television grew and grew at the time the film was made and continues to flourish &#150; whether you enjoy the medium is beside the point, the ever growing number of channels and popular talent shows goes on and on, echoing the ideas Van Sant puts into this film.Stone sees the marrying of Larry Maretto as a financial bookmark, the sort of person whose organised crime involved family will see them live in a nice house, in a nice neighbourhood and generally enjoy a wealth of some sort. Initially, Larry sees Sharon in the manner in which he wants to see her as this slightly less than bright but determined and hard working and quite attractive woman but the early signs that he may be drastically wrong are put across by his sister, who has her complaints about the woman. Following the wedding and several diversions into the future as Maretto family members and television network work colleagues vent with decided regret their opinions on Sharon and her actions; the film enters film noir mode and has an out and out, upfront seduction involving said woman and hapless young adult Jimmy Emmett (Phoenix) who doesn't know any better.One of the thrills of the film is watching it all unfold in the manner it does but like I said, the documentary side of the deal does sort of frustrate after a while as some narrate from the future and Stone talks, quite literally, into her own camera about who she is and what she's doing and while the intentions are good, it does sort of grate. But the study is there. Stone's tape is eerily similar to any one of those many recorded reality TV auditions as young, less-than-bright adults try to talk about themselves in a desperate attempt to get onto television and by that automatic token, hopefully achieve fame.While this is all well and good, Van Sant hurries his final act due to the realisation things must round off soon. He allows Stone to allow Jimmy's female friend Alison (Mertz) to overhear the sex they have, piling on a rather obvious sensation that Sharon's in danger of giving the game away and on one such occasion in a very crowded public place, she spills out the entire plan to her. Regardless, Van Sant has made something that's a fascinating study at times; illogical at others and gives us a few too many post-modern touches for it to be wholly satisfying but Kidman sparkles in a role that demands a ruthless but rather dim persona and you do come away with a bizarre, indistinct reaction to it all of satisfaction; sadness; anger and frustration all at once.

Stone's tape is eerily similar to any one of those many recorded reality TV auditions as young, less-than-bright adults try to talk about themselves in a desperate attempt to get onto television and by that automatic token, hopefully achieve fame.While this is all well and good, Van Sant hurries his final act due to the realisation things must round off soon. He allows Stone to allow Jimmy's female friend Alison (Mertz) to overhear the sex they have, piling on a rather obvious sensation that Sharon's in danger of giving the game away and on one such occasion in a very crowded public place, she spills out the entire plan to her. Regardless, Van Sant has made something that's a fascinating study at times; illogical at others and gives us a few too many post-modern touches for it to be wholly satisfying but Kidman sparkles in a role that demands a ruthless but rather dim persona and you do come away with a bizarre, indistinct reaction to it all of satisfaction; sadness; anger and frustration all at once.

Half the enjoyment of this film is watching, and listening to, neurotic Larry as he reacts to his wife's excellent sleuthing adventure. She and Larry's friend Ted (Alan Alda) plot strategy on how to catch the presumed murderer, much to the chagrin of Larry.Some of the dialogue is amusing, like when Carol insists that Larry accompany her to the suspects' apartment for some serious nosing around. Says Larry I can't relax; I'm in a strange man's apartment in my T-shirt and pajamas.My impression is that at least some of the dialogue is semi-improvised. Whatever the dialogue method, the result is back and forth banter that sounds highly natural and convincing. When you combine this naturalistic style of talk with terrific performances by Allen, Keaton, Alda, and several other actors, the time flies by, and you're sorry when the film ends.The murder mystery element isn't really believable. But that's okay, since it's strictly ancillary to the characterizations and the humorous talk. Even so, there is indeed a puzzle that will be solved by the film's end.Editing and cinematography are fine. Background music features 1930's and 40's pop songs. With all the NYC street scenes, I even learned what New Yorkers mean when they refer to a crosstown bus.Normally, I don't care for talky films.

With a legendary cast list and one of the greatest directors of all time, Billy Wilder, at the helm this movie goes the gamut of emotions. This is truly a film that grabs hold of you and you hold back. There is a lot going on through various levels of the film which enable one to see it over and over and always find a little something you didn't see before. Jack Lemmon has so many memorable roles that his role in The Apartment is sometimes over looked. Lemmon was nominated for an Oscar for lead actor in 1961 for this film and did win several awards including a Golden Globe. Lemmon is funny, handles a little slapstick, he awkward and even suave. He pulls them all off with ease. He plays an everyman character stuck in a strange situation, a type of character that he absolutely perfected through his career.The Apartment takes place in Manhattan. C.C. Baxter, played by Jack Lemmon, is a clerk working at a large company and working for many bosses. In fact, he comments that his company has 31,259 employees at the home office alone. He's single and lends his one bedroom apartment to one of the executives for an evening. Word gets around and before you know it Baxter is lending his key to more than a few executives. The borrowed evenings are for rendezvous with mistresses and suddenly he is caught between company, bosses, landlord and neighbors. His evenings without his apartment get strained when Bud catches a cold. Shirley MacLaine is the lovely Fran Kubelik, the elevator girl that Bud has a crush on. A triangle of trouble develops when Bud discovers his boss Mr Sheldrake, played by an equally brilliant Fred MacMurray, has a thing with the lovely Fran Kubelik. This movie is in black and white. The art direction is amazing. The scenes of Baxter's office and the Orwellian space of people with adding machines as well as the apartment itself are spot on. When you see the apartment for the first time, you know you're in New York and you know just who lives there and if there is any doubt Baxter's character mentions that he pays $94 per month for the apartment. Wilder's story and direction are compelling and hysterical at the same time. There is no doubt this is best picture material. I think MacLaine was probably overlooked for a supporting actress award, her performance is that good.For me this film falls in the top 100 films ever made. I love that you can watch it many times and continue to walk away with something new. The black and while filming gives the movie a time reference and set of values frozen in that moment. The cast of Lemmon, MacLaine and MacMurray are amazing with the supporting cast playing an A game in their own roles. This film is a film-making lesson for anyone that studies film. 10\/10* ","genre":null},{"date":"4 February 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a brilliantly made film.

Doesn't need to be; for Wes Anderson's first film he takes partly (in theory) a cue from Michael Cimino's Thunderbolt and Lightfoot. There too were the real oddball outsider characters, looking for a leg up but not with the same kind of zeal of a real hard-bitten criminal or neo-noir. In Bottle Rocket there's an ex-volunteer at an insane asylum and a guy who works for a landscaping company and the two are thick as thieves- only they're not good at actually being thieves, with one or two moments of exception. And yet Anderson doesn't mine for the easy parts for comic effect. His sense of humor is in the small things, little character traits or a moment that pops out.It may depend on how one sees the characters, and how much one is a fan of the Wilson brothers, Luke and Owen. But what Anderson does capture is that innocent feeling of being unsure of life and the things that make friendships kind of awkward at times. The three criminals, played by Anthony, Dignan and Bob bicker and converse and do whatever like normal folk, not real gangsters like, say, Mr Henry (James Caan), but they aspire to that, and Dignan gets the closest. Meanwhile, on the lam from a robbery of a bookstore, Anthony falls for a Peruvian housemaid and Bob has his own worries with his backyard pot growth. Their appeal, really, is in how the interactions are based around a solid theme of loyalty and friendship, and the film-making takes it to another level.It's hard to say if I found this a really great comedy- there's a few big laughs, one with a hilarious botch during a climactic robbery with a shot at someone unexpected, and little ones like a PB&J just lifted off the ground or a bad encounter at a country club- but it's an unusually amazing heist-character-drama. Well, drama of sorts; it's the Wes Anderson style already in full mode, and it's exhilarating to watch him make 90 minutes feel a lot fuller, a lot more alive than most at such a running time. I also liked the Wilson brothers, with the both of them in their breakout roles completely on top with their subtle, zany and quietly crazy roles. Loved the music, the cinematography, but most of all the emphasis on character over plot. In heist movies, or just young\/lost-20-something generation movies, it's rarely this good.

As long as it is, there's a sense of greatness as one watches the film the camera sweeping across the desert and its majestic soundtrack pouring into your ears. There's no denying that as drawn out as the plot is, there's something powerful in every scene, whether its the beauty of the sun as it's caught on camera or the look on Peter O'Toole's face as he comes to yet another epiphany on his journey across the wilderness.O'Toole stars as TE Lawrence, a somewhat flamboyant but ambitious British soldier during World War I who is sent to Arabia where the Arabs are hoping to receive aid from the British in order to defeat parts of the Ottoman Empire. He ends up leading them successfully in a series of raids and battles and begins to suffer a conflict of allegiance between his British superiors and his Arab allies like Prince Feisal (Alec Guiness) and Sheriff Ali (Omar Sharif).The film is of Lawrence's journey. He undergoes many transformations and learns many sobering lessons along the way, like the guilt of killing and even the lust for killing in addition to the fact that although he fights for Arabs, he himself is about as white as one can get. Clearly seeing that personal journey is what makes O'Toole's performance one of the all- time greatest. Most of the film is plot and its dialog either plot-oriented or intended to be quotable tidbits of wisdom. Lawrence is our only emotional access into the film and O'Toole just nails the part. The look in his soft blue eyes whether of anger, sadness or gaiety is utterly convincing. Without him this film would be flat and lifeless, no matter how exceptionally well made it is.And exceptional is one way to put it. Director David Lean chooses to keep the camera on the outside as much as possible, opting for the wide scene-setting shot whenever possible, only getting close-up if it's O'Toole's face illustrating an important point in his character's journey of understanding. It also lets the lavish sets and breathtaking locales become an important part of the story. His goal appears at times to simply overwhelm you with the majesty of the desert, much like Lawrence found it captivating despite being far from anything like home. It's not about creating an intimacy with the film; Lean wants to create awe for members of the audience and that's what big far-away pans and a long thematic score achieve.Every line of dialog in the film seems to have a poignancy. Almost like Shakespeare, there's wisdom and insight into the conflict being dropped in every line, with scenes ending on revealing and thematic ideas. Whether it's dialog building the complex portrait of Lawrence or the nature of the Middle East conflict, something of value is present nearly the entire film. The only thing missing is that women are virtually absent from the film, which in essence adds a whole other layer to it.Movies like Lawrence don't really get made anymore. While the occasional lengthy biopic comes up, the newer, fast-paced Hollywood simply can't handle too many of them or afford to budget over a year of on-location shooting for something so weighty. That's why Lawrence of Arabia is such an untouchable classic.

It's not particularly pleasant. Yet it sure is trenchant. Bill D-Fens Foster (Michael Douglas) is an American who plays by all the rules. But one summer day, he gets stuck in L.A. traffic. The longer he sits in his car, the more fed up he gets with the hassle, the noise, the stress. He abandons his car and starts walking.For the duration of the film, Foster walks and walks, and walks, first to a small grocery store where the owner wants too much money for a soft drink. Stressed-out Foster trashes the place, as a way of standing up for my rights, as a consumer. Continuing his journey through the urban jungle he encounters (1) two gang members, (2) a friendly but robotic manager of a fast food joint, (3) the Nazi owner of a leather goods store, (4) a street construction crew, and (5) a couple of wealthy golfers. In each encounter, our anti-hero vents his anger, his exasperation.We all feel like Foster at times. But most of us have built-in psychological brakes that prevent destructive behavior; Foster does not have those brakes; instead he explodes. Not only does the film explore the stress of urban life, it also makes the point that there's not a lot that separates those who are financially secure from those who are not.The film's themes are highly relevant to contemporary urban living. But the film has a major plotting problem. Too much time is spent on Detective Prendergast (Robert Duvall) and especially his wife, Amanda. And the police crew giving Prendergast his retirement party is extremely annoying. A lot of the scenes dealing with these ancillary characters could have been cut.Foster's wife, or ex-wife, Beth, is one character I detested. She refuses to let Bill see his little girl on the girl's birthday. That refusal inflames Bill, and rightly so. His wife (or ex-wife) is selfish and insensitive.The film's tone is not realistic. Yes, urban life is stressful. But it's not as melodramatic as the film would lead one to believe. So much of the acting and dialogue are overwrought. The Nazi store owner, played by Frederic Forrest, seriously overacts, for example.Falling Down has a lot to say about the stresses of contemporary American life. Yet, I found the film hard to watch, partly because of the poor plotting, and partly because the subject matter is not palatable.
