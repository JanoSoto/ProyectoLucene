[{"date":"22 March 2009","score":"","review":" It was a film with mystic force that made me stared at from the beginning when I started to watch. The story is a quite simple that two stories are running parallel to go for drug and become addicted. Main characters are four actors Harry (Jared Leto) & his mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn), Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). Harry and Tyrone earn their living on the drug and theft and Harry is getting to become addicted to drugs with his girlfriend Marion. I like a scene that Harry and Marion are laying down talking their love, which is a very fantastic scene in this film. Although they are talking drugs, there exists something true and pure sense of love between them; he loves his girlfriend the best in the world and make the most of every minutes with their love. This scene would emphasize the last half that drugs break up their relationship.On the other hand, Harry's mother Sara starts dieting since she got an odd call that she can appear on the TV. She tried to diet as much as possible she can. She starts relying on medicine for a diet before long and she often sundown that she appears on the TV or see the fridge shaking due to extreme diet or starving.The ending is in the depth of without the beacon of the hope. It may be easier to guess in this kind of drug story but still suffer from feeling of emptiness and kind of helpless feeling after watched this film. But I'd say this is a great movie at the same time.Ellen Burstyn, being 70-year-old shows an amazing portrayal who make her life change from a common life to become a drug addict and have to be in a drug rehabilitation. Also Jennifer Connelly's play, become a drug addict, quarrel with his boyfriend Harry, have a sex scene for getting drugs, this her devoting work worth seeing.

Michael Corleone does not want this. But his estranged ex-wife, Kay, manages to convince him to let Anthony Corleone pursue music as he wishes. So he does.That seems like an odd way to start a review, as it is a minor plot point and has nothing really to do with the major action. Just bear with me here; you'll see where I'm going with this eventually. Now let me tell you about the major plot. It is about Michael Corleone wanting to quit crime for good (he has largely abandoned all criminal elements in his family business). But then along comes Vincent Mancini, an illegitimate nephew, who is involved in a feud. So of course Michael must endure yet another brush with criminality and gun violence and all that good gangster stuff. Meanwhile, Vincent has a semi-incestuous affair with Michael's daughter Mary. Oh, and Michael and Kay are trying to patch up all the horrid things that happened at the end of Part II.It is like a soap opera. One horrid, awful, 169-minute soap opera. Gone is any sort of the sophistication, romance, and emotional relevance that made the first two movies hit home so hard. After a 16-year break in the franchise, Francis Ford Coppola delivered a mess of sop and pretentiousness entirely incongruous with the first two films, once again proving his last great work was Apocalypse Now back in the 1970's.What's worse, The Godfather Part III isn't even a logical follow-up of The Godfather Part II. Michael is a completely different person. He hasn't just gone to seed (which might be legitimate, even if it'd be no fun to watch). He's become a goody-goody that's trying to fix all the tragedy that made Part II such a devastating masterpiece. His confession to the priest was bad enough, but that little diabetes attack in the middle pushed it over to nauseating. He also gets back together with Kay! For heaven's sakes, there is absolutely no way that should happen, as the 2nd movie made abundantly clear! She aborted his baby, and his Sicilian upbringing made him despise her for it. Didn't Francis Ford Coppola even think of these things?And don't even get me started on Mary and Vincent's affair! For a romance so forbidden, it was shockingly unengaging. Sofia Coppola's acting did nothing to help. She made the smartest move of her life when she switched from in front of the camera to behind it, because she was possibly THE worst actress I have ever seen in a Best Picture nominee. Every line she delivered was painfully memorized, and every time the drama rested on her acting abilities, all she elicited was inappropriate giggles. In the climactic scene--I won't go into detail, but you'll know which scene I'm talking about when\/if you watch it--she looks at Michael and says, ......Daddy? I think I was meant to cry, but the line was delivered so poorly I burst out into long, loud laughter!Now we get to the climax, and now you will also realize why I took time to start the review with a description of Anthony Corleone's musical ambitions. After 140 minutes of petty drama and irrelevant happenstances, Anthony Corleone returns... with an opera! So Michael, Kay, Mary, and Vincent go to see it, and for about 10-15 minutes a couple killers walk around trying to assassinate Michael. About this climactic sequence, I must say one thing It was really good! But not because of the killers--they were pretty boring. I just really liked the opera. It had some great music and real great set pieces. And, from what little it showed us, it seemed that the story had echoes of the Corleone family's origin. I'll bet it was one swell opera, and I'll bet Michael Corleone was glad he let his son switch from law school to music.My biggest wish is this that Francis Ford Coppola had merely filmed Anthony Corleone's opera for 169 minutes and ditched the rest of the soggy melodrama. Better yet, I wish he hadn't made The Godfather Part III at all. Part II gave us the perfect ending. This spin off was self-indulgent and unnecessary.P.S. This is not a gut reaction to the film. I watched all 3 Godfather films over a month ago (though I was rewatching the first one). Not only does this mean that my expectations for Part III weren't screwed (in fact, I had set the bar rather low for it after what I heard), but it also means I've had a good time to think about all three films. While I was a bit disappointed with Part II at first, the more I thought about it, the better it seemed. But with Part III, it was bad to begin with, then got worse the more I thought about it. The sad thing is that many people will stop with Part I, but if they watch Part II as well, they will most likely go on to Part III. If you have the will, watch Parts I & II and pretend like Part III never existed.

But of course since I'm 23 and on my own, I think I was allowed to view it. I kinda wish now that I had my parents here to tell me no because this movie was really bad. I mean most people make fun of Showgirls, I mean yeah, it's understandable, but at least that had personality and more memorable moments than this. Demi Moore just strips down to some really depressing music and this movie has the strangest humor in the world. I could see how some people might get a kick out of it, but over all it just a bad movie, it has no zest and nothing to make it special. A story about a stripper... OK, here it goes.The film revolves around Erin Grant, a former FBI secretary, who loses custody of her young daughter Angela to her ex-husband Darrell. In order to afford an appeal, Erin becomes a stripper at the Eager Beaver, a Miami strip club. A Congressman named David Dilbeck visits the club and immediately begins to adore Grant. Aware of Dilbeck's embarrassing indulgences, another Eager Beaver patron approaches Erin with a plan to manipulate the Congressman to settle the custody dispute in Erin's favor. However, Dilbeck has powerful business connections who want to ensure he remains in office. Consequently, those who can embarrass him in an election are murdered. Meanwhile, Erin retrieves her daughter from her negligent husband. Dilbeck's personal interest in Erin persists, and she is invited to perform privately for him. He asks her to become his lover and later his wife, despite his staff's concerns that she knows too much information. A debate occurs as to whether to kill Erin or simply keep her quiet by threatening to take away her daughter.Demi is alright in the movie, if even that, I'm being pretty generous considering she let her daughter, Rumor, act as her daughter in this movie. If I were Rumor, I'd be like next time, I pick the mother\/daughter bonding event. I wouldn't really feel like watching my mother dance around naked for men nore a camera. Well Rumor must have gotten a huge raise in her allowance for that to happen.

Washington & Jolie perform well. Queen Latifa is very good and this is really one of the few films I have seen with her in. Ed O'Nneil gets away from Peg Bundy and the shoe store to become a serious cop in this one.While the plot seems to dig upon a lot of details, the killer motives seem to be a little strange. This serial killer starts off seeming to have a motive for killing, but then seems to veer off totally randomly choosing victims because they are there and killing a cop just for sport at one point in the film.This is one of the least sexy roles I have seen for Jolie. She is obviously attractive in this movie, but not a real sex symbol. This film gives her a more cerebral edge as her love for Washington's character is presented more as an intelligence driven thing rather than being anything physical. Thank goodness her uniforms fit properly as I hate those movies which exploit a woman playing this kind of character by squeezing them into something they can't even bend over in.While this film is not perfect, there are worse ones. After all, not every lawyer can be Denny Crane, so think on it, sleep on it, and pray on it and you will be entertained.

This serial killer starts off seeming to have a motive for killing, but then seems to veer off totally randomly choosing victims because they are there and killing a cop just for sport at one point in the film.This is one of the least sexy roles I have seen for Jolie. She is obviously attractive in this movie, but not a real sex symbol. This film gives her a more cerebral edge as her love for Washington's character is presented more as an intelligence driven thing rather than being anything physical. Thank goodness her uniforms fit properly as I hate those movies which exploit a woman playing this kind of character by squeezing them into something they can't even bend over in.While this film is not perfect, there are worse ones. After all, not every lawyer can be Denny Crane, so think on it, sleep on it, and pray on it and you will be entertained.

But, I think this one, although none of the actors, directors, or screenwriters have witnessed the Titanic like some of the previous movies of the Titanic, they have told a great story using great special effects that may be the closest to what this generation has to witnessing the Titanic.I was born in 1993, so you can tell how young I was when I saw this movie. Most of my life, I assumed that Gloria Stuart was actually an old woman who has been on the Titanic, until I began doing more on the internet than chatting, which must have been around 2005. I was an idiot, and I found out there was no old lady on the Titanic who told her story to director James Cameron and therefor, this movie is almost completely fake. Maybe there was a Jack and Rose and an old painting that has been lost at sea. But the chances that is true is no different than the chances of me getting a girlfriend this year. Which is low. Haha. Wah.Jack and Rose, two lovers from completely different worlds, come on a ship that happens to be the biggest ship the world has ever seen at that time.

Just cover your eyes once you get to the nudity.. well, cover your children's eyes.

Early on in his career he made some truly brilliant- and also often very underrated and under-appreciated movies. Obsession is one of his earlier movies, made before his big breakthrough with the movie Carrie. Although this movie certainly isn't among his best it's still an above average genre movie, due to De Palma's direction quality.It's obvious that the biggest influence in De Palma's work is Hitchcock. Some people call him a Hitchcock rip-off but his movies are often simply too good and classy for that. Nothing wrong with someone carrying on Hitchcock's work in a more modern day and age of film-making. De Palma's movies are often very old fashioned in their style and way of storytelling. Whenever a movie attempts to be old fashioned, like movies from the '40's, it often ends up being a complete failure. De Palma however often succeeds in this, as is the case- though to some less extend, with this movie.This is far from a perfect genre movie and those who are familiar with these type of movies can see the twists coming from miles away. It's a very little surprising movie that however still has plenty of qualities that uplift it.The main thing that keeps this movie down is really its story. It's rather slow (because it's done in an old fashioned style) and it's made even slower by its main character that looks depressed all of the time. It's hard to really care for him when he's walking around so moody all of the time. Hard to say if this is Cliff Robertson's fault, or the script or directing. Probably all three are too blame for it.It nevertheless remains a very pleasant movie to watch, due to its style. It's a real good looking movie, that with Vilmos Zsigmond also has a nice director of photography involved. It was the first collaboration between him and Brian De Palma, out of 4 movies they did together so far. The fine musical score is from Alfred Hitchcock's steady composer Bernard Herrmann, which really helps to set the right mood for this movie as well. He died shortly afterward. He was supposed to become Brian De Palma's new main composer but it unfortunately wasn't to be.The movie has some real typical trademark Brian De Palma moments in them. Sequences that make the movie great and memorable, even when the rest of the movie just isn't that great or interesting to watch. The ending is also typical De Palma-like, even though it isn't the best or most satisfying ending imaginable for the movie.It was also great to see a still fairly young John Litgow in this movie. It was one of his first movie roles and he did a great job within this movie, especially with his accent. He later also appeared in other De Palma movies, though ironically never his best known ones.A good early De Palma movie, that already shows his talent and trademark style, that made me a fan of his work, even his lesser movies.7\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"22 March 2009","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The Brian De Palma today isn't the Brian De Palma he used to be.

Dodsworth belongs to a tradition of simple yet deeply poignant romances that includes Brief Encounter, The African Queen and Remains of the Day. Thanks to some great acting performances under the guidance of William Wyler it is one of the best in the field.This is Wyler's first truly excellent picture, in which his unique approach seems to have fully matured. Wyler famously (or perhaps not so famously) directed more Oscar-nominated acting performances than anyone else. It wasn't reportedly through great coaching, although his demand for repeated takes surely helped. What Wyler seems to have understood better than anyone else is that a performance is made up of different components - vocal delivery, facial expression, physical presence and so forth - and part of a director's job is to decide which of these to capture at any given moment. For Wyler, getting the right angle on the action was paramount even if it meant violating cinematic convention. Dodsworth is brimming with examples of this.Take the opening scene, where we first meet Sam Dodsworth. As the camera tracks in Walter Huston has his back to us - we know from the context that this is an emotional time for him, but we are not shown his face. This stops the moment from seeming forced, and allows the emergence of the character to happen gradually. Huston communicates his feelings through posture alone. Wyler then shows him leaving via the most tentative and indirect method possible - a few lines of dialogue offscreen, after which we see his shadow cross the newspaper headline. It is an incredibly tender and respectful introduction to the character, and pays off as his story continues. Throughout the picture the camera tends to be kept at a distance, which emphasises that bittersweet sense of loneliness and also gives those intense facial close-ups at the end (the only ones in the whole picture) all the more impact.Sometimes Wyler's method of showing (or not showing) a facet of a performance could be highly elaborate. In a key scene between Ruth Chatterton and Gregory Gaye, he needs to have Chatterton in the foreground and Gaye in the background, but it is Gaye's expression that we need to focus on. Wyler solves the problem by placing a lampshade in the foreground which actually obscures Chatterton's head, whilst at the same time framing Gaye. Later in the same scene he shows Gaye (in the foreground this time) watching Chatterton walk away offscreen, although she is reflected in the mirror behind him. Unlike the swooping camera moves or bewildering close-ups that some directors favour, these deceptively simple tactics are rarely distracting because they allow us to become totally absorbed in the performances and the scene.And what performances... This was probably Walter Huston's career best. What's remarkable is that on paper Sam Dodsworth is not an entirely sympathetic character - shouting at his daughter, sending a spy out after his wife - but as played by Huston he is amazingly likable, and audience members will genuinely care about what happens to him. The other Oscar nominee was Maria Ouspenskaya. Her performance is expressive and certainly memorable so I can see why it got the nod, but Ruth Chatterton and Mary Astor would have been more worthy nominees for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress respectively. It's also somewhat unfortunate that Ouspenskaya's performance distracts us from Gregroy Gaye, who hovers in the background doing what is probably the best bit of emotional acting of his career.Also worthy of special mention is Alfred Newman's musical score. Normally a highly emotive score like this weakens a dramatic picture - music shouldn't be there to tell the audience how to feel - but in this case the melody is so beautiful and so perfectly captures the tone that it doesn't matter. The letter burning scene also makes great use of diagetic music, which is rather rare for this period. Again I'm surprised Newman didn't get an Oscar nomination, but perhaps the score was judged too sparse and simple for that.For such gems as Dodsworth, we have to thank directors who had no ego, and no agenda other than to get the most out of a screenplay. This is one of the most mature and deeply affecting dramas of its era, and still has great resonance today.

The letter burning scene also makes great use of diagetic music, which is rather rare for this period. Again I'm surprised Newman didn't get an Oscar nomination, but perhaps the score was judged too sparse and simple for that.For such gems as Dodsworth, we have to thank directors who had no ego, and no agenda other than to get the most out of a screenplay. This is one of the most mature and deeply affecting dramas of its era, and still has great resonance today. ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"22 March 2009","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" While the romance genre may first call to mind the wild and passionate embraces of young lovers, it is usually the more tentative, less glamorous love stories that are the most effective. Dodsworth belongs to a tradition of simple yet deeply poignant romances that includes Brief Encounter, The African Queen and Remains of the Day. Thanks to some great acting performances under the guidance of William Wyler it is one of the best in the field.This is Wyler's first truly excellent picture, in which his unique approach seems to have fully matured. Wyler famously (or perhaps not so famously) directed more Oscar-nominated acting performances than anyone else. It wasn't reportedly through great coaching, although his demand for repeated takes surely helped. What Wyler seems to have understood better than anyone else is that a performance is made up of different components - vocal delivery, facial expression, physical presence and so forth - and part of a director's job is to decide which of these to capture at any given moment. For Wyler, getting the right angle on the action was paramount even if it meant violating cinematic convention. Dodsworth is brimming with examples of this.Take the opening scene, where we first meet Sam Dodsworth. As the camera tracks in Walter Huston has his back to us - we know from the context that this is an emotional time for him, but we are not shown his face. This stops the moment from seeming forced, and allows the emergence of the character to happen gradually. Huston communicates his feelings through posture alone. Wyler then shows him leaving via the most tentative and indirect method possible - a few lines of dialogue offscreen, after which we see his shadow cross the newspaper headline. It is an incredibly tender and respectful introduction to the character, and pays off as his story continues. Throughout the picture the camera tends to be kept at a distance, which emphasises that bittersweet sense of loneliness and also gives those intense facial close-ups at the end (the only ones in the whole picture) all the more impact.Sometimes Wyler's method of showing (or not showing) a facet of a performance could be highly elaborate. In a key scene between Ruth Chatterton and Gregory Gaye, he needs to have Chatterton in the foreground and Gaye in the background, but it is Gaye's expression that we need to focus on. Wyler solves the problem by placing a lampshade in the foreground which actually obscures Chatterton's head, whilst at the same time framing Gaye. Later in the same scene he shows Gaye (in the foreground this time) watching Chatterton walk away offscreen, although she is reflected in the mirror behind him. Unlike the swooping camera moves or bewildering close-ups that some directors favour, these deceptively simple tactics are rarely distracting because they allow us to become totally absorbed in the performances and the scene.And what performances... This was probably Walter Huston's career best. What's remarkable is that on paper Sam Dodsworth is not an entirely sympathetic character - shouting at his daughter, sending a spy out after his wife - but as played by Huston he is amazingly likable, and audience members will genuinely care about what happens to him. The other Oscar nominee was Maria Ouspenskaya. Her performance is expressive and certainly memorable so I can see why it got the nod, but Ruth Chatterton and Mary Astor would have been more worthy nominees for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress respectively. It's also somewhat unfortunate that Ouspenskaya's performance distracts us from Gregroy Gaye, who hovers in the background doing what is probably the best bit of emotional acting of his career.Also worthy of special mention is Alfred Newman's musical score.

I really enjoy Meet Joe Black, (besides the ending); find Beverly Hills Cop to be highly entertaining; and have heard good things about Scent of a Woman despite Al Pacino's Oscar winning over-the-top Who-Hahs, and now I can add Midnight Run to the mix of pre-implosion Brest goodness. With a great cast, including odd-couple Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin leading the way, a humorous script, and impressive action sequences on this cross-country trip gone awry, the film overcomes its 1980s atmosphere, (the first class plane set-up is exact to that used in the Wedding Singer, sorry, I had to point that out), to age gracefully and remain as good now as people I've heard say it was; those who had seen it back then.De Niro is an ex-cop turned bounty hunter for a Los Angeles bail-bondsman&#151;a slimy cretin like only Joe Pantoliano can do&#151;that has been enlisted to capture the embezzling accountant of the mob boss that made him lose his job on the force. So, in one fell swoop, his Jack Walsh can make $100,000, get back at the criminal who took his life away, and put a crook behind bars as his self-righteous, by-the-books sensibilities like him to do. By by-the-books, I mean as far as not taking payoffs, not being on the payroll of a drug dealer, and not covering for cops who are. I don't mean someone who takes the safety of his prisoner seriously, nor Miranda rights or any other creature comforts the people in his custody may deserve. He'll handcuff you inside a train car bathroom, throw you into a rapid flowing river, toss you from a moving train, and lead you through a gunfight. But that is the kind of stuff that makes the film so much fun. If there weren't antics and reason for De Niro and Grodin's accountant The Duke to hate each other, their sarcasm and biting rapport would never come through.And that is truly what makes Midnight Run so enjoyable to watch. The chemistry between these two leads is phenomenal. We've got the city cop, blue-collar mentality of Jack pitted against the intellectual, white-collared obnoxiousness of Jon Mardukas. Grodin basically epitomizes the annoying child you may have on a long trip that constantly asks whether you are there yet. His questions and unceasing fervor at which he attempts to get the answers would give anyone an ulcer as they try to keep their temper in check. This is vintage Grodin and makes you wonder where he has gone. Looking back at his career, he didn't act in very many films, and when he did it was in smaller roles. However, the guy doesn't deserve to go out with the Beethoven movies. Someone's got to cast him in something, having only one credit to his name in the past fifteen years. As for De Niro, you may be able to call this the first sign of the comedic bent he has embraced in the last few years. Sadly, he has become a caricature of himself lately, but visiting this gem from 1988 definitely shows you the talent he has, the ability to go from serious to funny, especially with a guy like Grodin to bounce off of.The script may be a bit obvious, at least as far as connecting the start to the finish. As for as the journey to get there, however, everything, including the kitchen sink, is thrown into the mix. Our duo has the feds on their tail, hit men from Denis Farina's mob boss Jimmy Serrano, (I still love how great this guy is at playing hard-ass wiseguys, yet he was a cop before turning to Hollywood), a competing bounty hunter looking to collect the cash, city police forces, people consorting behind their backs mucking things up, and whatever else you can think of. Jack Walsh is no pushover though, he is the kind of guy that sets his mind to something and follows it through to the end. Only caring for him and the future he hopes to eventually realize, you soon learn that he'll do anything for self-preservation. The way he treats bounty hunter rival Marvin Dorfler, (supporting journeyman John Ashton), really gets this point across&#151;use whomever until they aren't needed anymore, then drop them off and continue on.There are many little things that add to the overall success of the film as well. Yaphet Kotto's FBI Agent Mosely becomes a lot of fun as he follows one step behind for the duration, the bumbling hit-man are always enjoyable, (having one act like a child, playing around all the time while the other tries to talk to the boss helps), and just the subtle way in which De Niro's past is revealed through his conversations with Grodin bring so much more to what would otherwise be a simple comic actioner. You do find out a lot about the leads through their actions and interactions with those they cross paths with. De Niro's family life and moral compass eventually reveals the kind of man he is, hidden beneath the hard exterior, and Grodin's reasons for what he did come out into the open as well. There are motivations behind each action and that attention to detail, coupled with a witty and strongly performed screenplay, shows what Brest can do when he's given the pieces necessary to succeed.

While all of the films (except Rocky 5) are very good, the first Rocky film stands above all of them as the best of the series.Rocky Balboa is a boxer who also collects money. He is living in the slums of Philadelphia and is not really achieving what he should be. As luck would have it the heavyweight champion of the world selects Rocky as his next opponent due to the fact that he wants to fight an Italian on independence day in Philadelphia. This opportunity leads to Rocky starting to try to achieve things that he never dreamed of before.Often people refer to Rocky as a boxing film but it is so much more. THe acting in this film is great and so is the tone. There are a lot of scenes where characters are silent and reflecting on things that the audience easily can tell. Like how in the beginning Rocky is looking at himself in the mirror as if to say what happened to me?.The interaction between characters is awesome. Stallone does an awesome job as ROcky and this is his best performance in a film. How he did not win best actor is beyond absurd. THis is acting at its best. Rocky first meets adrian in this film and this is where the relationship starts. Also awesome in this film is Paulie, Adrians brother. The character of Paulie is very important because it shows the side of envy and disappointment that many people relate too.While a few of the later films in the Rocky series are action flicks, this one is drama. THere is a lot of training and a great boxing match at the end but the story really is about Rocky and his relationship with several other characters like Paulie, Adrian, and Mickey. This film does an awesome job of developing characters which helps make the series endure for so long.WHo can resist an underdog story? Rocky working hard in this film is awesome. THe Gonna fly now song is awesome as Rocky is training. THis is easily one of the most motivational films I have ever seen. Just thinking about Rocky training in this film makes me think that I can achieve anything.The boxing match at the end of this film is epic. Nothing quite measures up to it due to how it is set up. THe guy who has no business being in the ring with the heavyweight champion of the world.

I imagine the filmmaker George Franju saw some of these too and decided, in the Godardian New-Wave tradition (Franju, after all, was the co-founder of the Cinematheque so he too must have been a vociferous film buff), to make a movie as criticism, to make a film about a highly respected doctor in France who has a daughter without flesh on her face and takes the skin off of many girls (because if you at first don't succeed, try, try again) to graft on to her face as a new one, as seriously as anyone might take a film of the most prestigious kind. This is one of those stories for grown-ups, or just anyone looking for a superb rendition of horror made personal, straight-faced, creepy as f*** and unforgettable.Part of it is just the direction, as it never does anything too crazy to sensationalize or make gimmicky. There's consummate professionalism going all the way for Franju. But at the same time he's also interested in a certain eerie, Gothic approach the opening scene with Alida Valli (of the Third Man) in the car driving with the other dead woman in the backseat in a trench-coat and hat is about as horrifyingly shot as any scene I can think of in movies of the past 50 years. There's other scenes like that, or ones that just subtly pile on the atmosphere like when the doctor's daughter, played by the beautiful and perfectly sensitive Edith Scob, just walks around the house or around the dogs used for experimentation. But maybe most effective of all is how he doesn't turn away or cut much during a really harrowing scene at the mid-point when we see up close the process of cutting off the skin of a sedated woman. For a movie from 1959 it's still shocking, for its deliberate pace and its need to avoid senseless shock value. What is there does the trick.And while the performances are all very good, particularly from the actor playing the doctor who barely ever raises his voice unlike so many mad scientists and PHD's in these kind of horror movies, and from Valli and from some of the supporting players (at most, for conventional sake, we get the one girl who screams at the sight of Christiane's real face at one point), it's the dark and doom-like atmosphere that really make Eyes Without a Face stand out as a classic. Not to mention, of course, the music by Mauriece Jarre. This is music that would give chills to the most hard-bitten genre fans; Maurice Jare goes from notes of a bizarre carnivalesque nature to more sad passages with Christiane, like when she's just walking around or when we see her with the mask on. In fact it's one of those scores that is so good that you cannot picture the music without the movie, or visa-versa (the same can also be said of his Lawrence of Arabia score).And yet the director is also wise to only use the music when it fits best, and so the film takes on an oddly and daringly realistic tone at times. The camera-work takes some liberties with style (I mean that as a compliment), but it's never too over-the-top, never too much with the hey, look at me, I'm doing a creepy horror movie! It also helps that he has some fantastic writing to work from- two of the writers also wrote the original Diabolique and Vertigo- as that element also is keenly aware of what makes horror really tick. You won't easily forget Eyes Without a Face, as a piece of pure cinema and as a not too dated piece of genre oneupmanship. And it's still, ultimately, a fun time to have even with all of the gloom and fatalism of the picture.

But at the same time he's also interested in a certain eerie, Gothic approach the opening scene with Alida Valli (of the Third Man) in the car driving with the other dead woman in the backseat in a trench-coat and hat is about as horrifyingly shot as any scene I can think of in movies of the past 50 years. There's other scenes like that, or ones that just subtly pile on the atmosphere like when the doctor's daughter, played by the beautiful and perfectly sensitive Edith Scob, just walks around the house or around the dogs used for experimentation. But maybe most effective of all is how he doesn't turn away or cut much during a really harrowing scene at the mid-point when we see up close the process of cutting off the skin of a sedated woman. For a movie from 1959 it's still shocking, for its deliberate pace and its need to avoid senseless shock value. What is there does the trick.And while the performances are all very good, particularly from the actor playing the doctor who barely ever raises his voice unlike so many mad scientists and PHD's in these kind of horror movies, and from Valli and from some of the supporting players (at most, for conventional sake, we get the one girl who screams at the sight of Christiane's real face at one point), it's the dark and doom-like atmosphere that really make Eyes Without a Face stand out as a classic. Not to mention, of course, the music by Mauriece Jarre. This is music that would give chills to the most hard-bitten genre fans; Maurice Jare goes from notes of a bizarre carnivalesque nature to more sad passages with Christiane, like when she's just walking around or when we see her with the mask on. In fact it's one of those scores that is so good that you cannot picture the music without the movie, or visa-versa (the same can also be said of his Lawrence of Arabia score).And yet the director is also wise to only use the music when it fits best, and so the film takes on an oddly and daringly realistic tone at times. The camera-work takes some liberties with style (I mean that as a compliment), but it's never too over-the-top, never too much with the hey, look at me, I'm doing a creepy horror movie! It also helps that he has some fantastic writing to work from- two of the writers also wrote the original Diabolique and Vertigo- as that element also is keenly aware of what makes horror really tick. You won't easily forget Eyes Without a Face, as a piece of pure cinema and as a not too dated piece of genre oneupmanship. And it's still, ultimately, a fun time to have even with all of the gloom and fatalism of the picture.

I like the way Morgan freeman narrates in the movie which makes it all the more interesting. The scene where Andy gets beer for his coworkers. Also when he plays the two Italian singers on prison radio. Brooks last few days.And how Red comes to terms with his freedom. I recently watched it for the first time and can't believe how i could miss this for so long. I Also cant believe Morgan never won Oscar for this. I cant think of any better performance than this.Truly deserves the number one spot. Since last week i have watched it 3 times and plan to watch it again. Thank you Frank Darabont for giving us hope.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"22 March 2009","score":"","review":" Only the likes of Quentin Tarantino could make a gangster movie as unconventional and as fresh as Reservoir Dogs. With it's chunky dialogue, unsettling violence, non-linear storyline and excellent performances from it's talented cast, it's everything you would expect from the director and something that more movies should aspire to be.During a daylight jewelry heist, six well-seasoned criminals find themselves at odds when things go terribly wrong. The alarm is tripped, the cops show up and a lot of blood is shed. Despite the fact that they don't know each other's names -- they are instead given color-coded aliases to go by -- they have formed a kinship with one another that is broken within two crucial minutes. Retreating to a nearby warehouse, they tend to one of their own who has been wounded in action while simultaneously trying to figure out which of them is the rat. When talking doesn't settle things, they resort to gun-play, while the true story unfolds behind them. What results is a tightly wound, slow-burning little crime-drama known as Reservoir Dogs.Setting a precedent for crime-dramas, Reservoir Dogs is notable not only for it's unconventional story-telling, but also for the fact that the job is never shown on-screen. Instead, the movie focuses on its characters, played by the likes of Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn and Tarantino himself. Keitel and Buscemi, in particular, are truly natural in their roles and keep the movie feeling genuine and engaging. Madsen plays the unpredictable role of Mr. Blonde almost too realistically, constructing a character that nearly steals the show, and who certainly has one of the most memorable moments of the film. Tim Roth doesn't have much to do here besides gush blood, but in his back-story, shows both strength and vulnerability. Tarantino -- despite being somewhat of an amateur at the time -- finds his vision early on in the film, establishing a style that pays tribute to his influences, while simultaneously breaking new ground only to influence a wave of film-makers in his wake. Made for just under a million, Tarantino stretches an inch into a mile into this amazing little film. It's simple, yet effective. It's loaded with fresh dialogue and a cast that works so well together that you feel like you're in that warehouse with them. Even when you know how the story goes, and it you find yourself watching it over and over again, it never fails to entertain and stimulate the senses, making Reservoir Dogs a certifiable classic.
