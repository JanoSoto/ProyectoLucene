[{"date":"21 February 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I wasn't around for the 1950's, at the height of the Cold War, but I've read enough to know the sense of fear and even paranoia that those days inspired in people. Perhaps the height of the Cold War came in 1957, when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik - the first artificial satellite to orbit the earth. October Sky opens with the launch of Sputnik, and that opening captures very well the sense of fear that overtook one town - Coalwood, West Virginia as news of the launch spread. But it wasn't all fear. To some it was inspiration. Coalwood was exactly what the name sounds like - a coal mining town, whose people were basically expected to live and die in the coal mines, with few opportunities to get out. But watching Sputnik soar through the sky overhead inspired high school student Homer Hickham (a wonderful performance by Jake Gyllenhaal) to want something more. He along with several friends become rocket enthusiasts, dreaming of escaping the dreary little town and of doing greater things, with the support of a sympathetic high school science teacher (played by Laura Dern).I wouldn't call this a riveting movie. It is - once again - the classic formula of the underdog striving to overcome. Coalwood isn't expected to produce rocket scientists. Aside from the odd football player, it produces coal miners, and Homer has to overcome the doubts of many in the town, and especially his own father (Chris Cooper), who is the boss of the local mine, whose life is dedicated to mining, and who naturally assumes that his son Homer (who, unlike his brother, has no football talent) will simply follow in his footsteps. The inspirational story aside, it's probably the uncomfortable relationship of father and son that's the centrepiece of October Sky. The relationship of father to the two sons who are so opposite in so many ways reminded me of an almost identical scene in Stand By Me as Homer strives for his father's attention, while his father is only concerned with talking about his brother's football games. That all takes place within the backdrop of a dying town completely dependent on one industry, whose people are scared - because they see the end coming and they see no future once the end comes. So, inspiring though it may be, there's also a sadness to this movie - a sadness at a way of life that's dying, a sadness for the people who have spent their lives and sometimes given their lives (or at least their health) for the sake of that way of life.It's impressive to see the dedication that Homer and his friends showed in the face of doubts and opposition from those around them, as their rocket science experiments finally take them to the National Science Fair, and gives them the opportunity to break free of what had seemed to be their destiny. And yet, while one understands that the story is the inspirational story of these boys striving for something bigger, one also gains respect for those in Coalwood. They're hard-working men, who give of themselves and who risk a lot for the sake of their families. Sometimes the dreary life overcomes them, with sad results, but there's still a measure of respect for them. So I thought this represented a good look at both sides of the question - those who dream of bigger things, and those who may have lost that dream, but who still do the best they can with what they have.In the end, it becomes a bit of a tear-jerker in a number of ways. It may not be a riveting movie, but it represents a good slice of life movie, and it seems to depict the thinking of the era and that particular environment quite well.

I don't know if it's in the eyes, or in the way he looked so young despite his 40's, but the sweetness and gentleness of his character made the film.Having only watched the remake with Robert Downey Jr., I thought Pendleton would reincarnate as a person and then realize who he was, while Beatty remains the same person, only using bodies as convenient media for his own personality, which is ethically acceptable, since all the bodies he takes would have been 'dead' otherwise. Joe only occupies bodies as settings for his own persona, illustrating the eternal philosophical connection between the body and the spirit. Now, I can't wait to see the original version by Ernst Lubitsch, with its evocative title  Here Comes Mr. Jordan.Heaven Can Wait made me wonder how I would react from the announcement of my own death? I guess more than from the loss of people I love, I would be sadder because of all the things I would never have the possibility to do again, to have totally annihilated my chances to be a specific person, to be whatever I wanted to be, and never having the chance to be something else. For Joe, it's the same disbelief tainted with a sort of child-like optimism, he's dead yet still believes he has a chance to achieve his only dream playing in the Super Bowl. Joe's personality is the emotional core of the film as it embodies our personal vision of happiness to be what we plan to be. It's all about our plans, and Heaven Can Wait tackles this issue with the constant idea that everything that is done is determined by fate, a plan made by an almighty entity.The film's most fascinating aspects lie between this incertitude of what is life and death, what is determined and what is natural, and Beatty's tactful direction never takes its message about life and death in a too depressing tone, keeping more in the tradition of Lubitch and Capra's films, and the hero's child-like attitude is compensated by the domineering presence of James Mason as a suave and comprehensive Head Executive aware of the bureaucratic mistakes that accidentally took his life. This point is crucial because it explains why I used the expression 'life was taken' instead of 'killed' and why Joe is given a second chance; he wasn't meant to be dead. And Joe is so good-hearted that he'll use this occasion to act positively, by taking the body of Mr. Farnsworth, an eccentric billionaire and controversial figure of the industrial world, a man whose life is targeted by his associate and wife, Charles Grodin and the Oscar-nominated Dyan Cannon, in irresistible comical performances.From a meaningful introspection in the concept of life and death, the film flirts with pure comedy through the switched-bodies formulas, and allows Beatty to shine as an altruistic person who'll almost redeem Fansworth for the sake of community, and whose only selfish motive would serve his dream to play on the Superbowl. This opens the gate to the two most poignant aspects of the story, the beautiful friendship with Corkle, Jack Warden as his coach and the growing romance with Julie Christie as one of Farnsworth's detractor, a British ecologist who'll be touched by the amount of generosity he'll suddenly display. Again, the on-screen chemistry between Beatty and Christie is perfect and the romantic bond growing between them is tactfully handled by a subtle and nuanced direction, combined with the villainous pair of Grodin and Cannon.But more than a romance, and a fantasy, the film also work as a great Sport film. In a interesting business meeting scene, Joe states his personal vision by comparing business with what he know best football. This is crucial as it highlights his most endearing virtue fair play. Joe doesn't do good actions because it's good but because it's fair, as it was fair that he would be allowed a second chance. Joe's second chance was also Mr. Farnsworth's second chance and then Tom Garrett's, one of his team-mates, if life is not to be taken for granted, neither is death. Fairness is the driver of the film, and something that elevate it beyond the level of a simple comedy, which makes us accept the idea that Farnsworth had to die, and that Joe couldn't live forever with his spirit in another body.This leads to a heartbreaking scene where the only one who knew Joe's secret, his buddy Corkle, realizes that Joe's spirit vanished, leaving him alone again with his souvenirs and his clarinet, Jack Warden almost made me cry and I'm glad his performance was recognized by the Academy. Then, Joe as Tom meets Julie Christie again, and he wonders if they haven't met. This very moment echoes a previous scene where he was aware that his days in Farnsworth's body were numbered, and then told her that she might find him somewhere in another form, and the ending gives a subtle idea of what the plan is about, and why sometimes, we can't help but having a feeling of déjà vu, or of having lived some situation in different eras.In a way, Heaven Can Wait's ending is bittersweet because we must face the death of Joe's spirit, the only price for him to play in the Super Bowl.

Through Take the Money and Run, Woody reinvents humor by combining the heritage of the pioneers Keaton and Chaplin's slapstick, the irreverent wisecracks of the Marx Brothers, the outrageousness of Mel Brooks and even the social commentary of stand-up comedy with a little something incarnated by that funny-looking geeky face that would become an icon of American comedy, and an inspiration for the new generation.Take the Money and Run is both a tribute to the pioneers and an inspiration for the newcomers.The film strikes by a smart novelty it is constructed like a TV mockumentary chronicling the life of Virgil Starkwell, a criminal whose empathy-builders (or redeeming qualities) are his total ineptitude as a bank robber and jail escapist and a tender romance with the beautiful Louise, played by the late Janet Margolin. The film features many interviews of people who played a significant part in Virgil's life, most notably his shameful parents who wear Groucho Marx masks to remain anonymous, a running gag that pays like a tribute to the spirit that most nourished Allen's inspiration. So yes, it's about the geeky neurotic loser who is to Allen what the Little Tramp, was to Chaplin a defining character. And the prologue of the film works, a posteriori, like Allen's perfect introduction to Cinema, as an actor\/director\/writer (although he shares the latter honor with a guy named Mickey Rose).And if the direction seems to lack the confidence that would grow from one decade of cinematic experience, amusingly, it drives more than it undermines the quality of the film.The advantage of a debut is to have nothing to be compared with and a certain freedom of mistakes and Allen handles this like someone aware of where he's going at &#x85; not necessarily with this film, but with the whole comical material he uses. The film can even be subtitled Everything You Wanted to Know About Woody Allen as it features whatever will forge his touch in the future the slapstick of the early 70's, the introspective character studies of the 70's\/80's, the romances dealt with a tender poignancy, and a writing that would have made Groucho Marx extremely proud. I concede that by trying to be everything, the film feels like it doesn't have a way and might have damaged the appreciation of many critics, including Roger Ebert, who didn't think much of Allen's debut (although he never denied his comedic talent) but if I can mention the editing as the technical alibi that saved the film from being an objective mess, I don't think it really matters since every scene works by itself with the same effect as from a good sketch.On the surface, Take the Money and Run is like Monty Python's Flying Circus only telling a story with a clear narrative structure.Indeed, each scene works independently as a sketch one involves the classic bank robbery where everyone points out spelling mistakes, a hilarious escape attempt with a gun made of a bar soap during an unfortunate rainy night, Allen getting ready for a date and trying to look handsome in front of his mirror (clumsily maneuvering his glasses), before a visually hysterical conclusion. And the romantic core driven by Virgil and Louise consolidates what would have felt like a simple assemblage of comic vignettes. Janet Margolin is by the way one of the highlights of the film, as it's impossible not to be mesmerized by her breath-taking beauty and thanks to her interaction and sweetness with Virgil, the film manages to touch our hearts. There are of course other elements that structure the film such as the running gag of people constantly breaking Allen's glasses, and the music, which remains for me one of the most memorable from a Woody Allen's film (along with Love and Death and Hannah and her Sisters.So, on the surface, Take the Money Run is structured by as series of failures that elevates Virgil's status as an endearing loser, constantly bullied and yet getting the beautiful girl and making her so nervous she stutters.But on the content, the film speaks much larger statements about the birth of a new talent for American Cinema, defining Cinema as the ultimate nerd's escapism, at least one Virgil succeeded in.Notice how till the end, Virgil becomes more confident, getting ready to spend time in jail, Virgil talks to a journalist while preparing a gun of soap and discussing his hobbies then he suddenly interrupts the flow of his answer and asks if it's raining out, the image freezes and the music comes back, providing a weirdly thrilling sensation as if the film was Allen's message to Cinema, a hymn for all the nerds who try to escape their miserable condition through talent and perseverance. For Virgil, it's robbery, for Allen, it's comedy, and Take the Money and Run might not the be the funniest or the most successful film but it sure paved the way to Bananas, Love and Death and less than a decade after, a Best Picture winner. And Virgil perfectly mirrors Allen's condition since Allen got himself beautiful women.Despite its modest aspect, the film is made with sincerity by a future comical genius who translated his flaws into a semi-autobiographical classic, to a point it's hard to comprehend the talent of Woody Allen without watching Take the Money and Run and I'm sure even Ebert would reconsider his view because it's precisely for all the films that came after, that Take the Money and Run should be judged with more enthusiasm.

I concede that by trying to be everything, the film feels like it doesn't have a way and might have damaged the appreciation of many critics, including Roger Ebert, who didn't think much of Allen's debut (although he never denied his comedic talent) but if I can mention the editing as the technical alibi that saved the film from being an objective mess, I don't think it really matters since every scene works by itself with the same effect as from a good sketch.On the surface, Take the Money and Run is like Monty Python's Flying Circus only telling a story with a clear narrative structure.Indeed, each scene works independently as a sketch one involves the classic bank robbery where everyone points out spelling mistakes, a hilarious escape attempt with a gun made of a bar soap during an unfortunate rainy night, Allen getting ready for a date and trying to look handsome in front of his mirror (clumsily maneuvering his glasses), before a visually hysterical conclusion. And the romantic core driven by Virgil and Louise consolidates what would have felt like a simple assemblage of comic vignettes. Janet Margolin is by the way one of the highlights of the film, as it's impossible not to be mesmerized by her breath-taking beauty and thanks to her interaction and sweetness with Virgil, the film manages to touch our hearts. There are of course other elements that structure the film such as the running gag of people constantly breaking Allen's glasses, and the music, which remains for me one of the most memorable from a Woody Allen's film (along with Love and Death and Hannah and her Sisters.So, on the surface, Take the Money Run is structured by as series of failures that elevates Virgil's status as an endearing loser, constantly bullied and yet getting the beautiful girl and making her so nervous she stutters.But on the content, the film speaks much larger statements about the birth of a new talent for American Cinema, defining Cinema as the ultimate nerd's escapism, at least one Virgil succeeded in.Notice how till the end, Virgil becomes more confident, getting ready to spend time in jail, Virgil talks to a journalist while preparing a gun of soap and discussing his hobbies then he suddenly interrupts the flow of his answer and asks if it's raining out, the image freezes and the music comes back, providing a weirdly thrilling sensation as if the film was Allen's message to Cinema, a hymn for all the nerds who try to escape their miserable condition through talent and perseverance. For Virgil, it's robbery, for Allen, it's comedy, and Take the Money and Run might not the be the funniest or the most successful film but it sure paved the way to Bananas, Love and Death and less than a decade after, a Best Picture winner. And Virgil perfectly mirrors Allen's condition since Allen got himself beautiful women.Despite its modest aspect, the film is made with sincerity by a future comical genius who translated his flaws into a semi-autobiographical classic, to a point it's hard to comprehend the talent of Woody Allen without watching Take the Money and Run and I'm sure even Ebert would reconsider his view because it's precisely for all the films that came after, that Take the Money and Run should be judged with more enthusiasm. ","genre":"Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"21 February 2012","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" After fifteen minutes I wanted to marry her, and after half an hour I completely gave up the idea of stealing her purse.This is intelligently nonsensical and brilliantly absurd, in other words it's 100% pure Woody Allen, here in his earliest display of a promising comical genius in the pivotal year of 1969. Through Take the Money and Run, Woody reinvents humor by combining the heritage of the pioneers Keaton and Chaplin's slapstick, the irreverent wisecracks of the Marx Brothers, the outrageousness of Mel Brooks and even the social commentary of stand-up comedy with a little something incarnated by that funny-looking geeky face that would become an icon of American comedy, and an inspiration for the new generation.Take the Money and Run is both a tribute to the pioneers and an inspiration for the newcomers.The film strikes by a smart novelty it is constructed like a TV mockumentary chronicling the life of Virgil Starkwell, a criminal whose empathy-builders (or redeeming qualities) are his total ineptitude as a bank robber and jail escapist and a tender romance with the beautiful Louise, played by the late Janet Margolin. The film features many interviews of people who played a significant part in Virgil's life, most notably his shameful parents who wear Groucho Marx masks to remain anonymous, a running gag that pays like a tribute to the spirit that most nourished Allen's inspiration. So yes, it's about the geeky neurotic loser who is to Allen what the Little Tramp, was to Chaplin a defining character.

And this is quite an accomplishment for a movie that is well over 3 hours long! It's just simply one that never drags or starts to become uninteresting at any point, due to the incredible diversity in its story and with its many characters.I think the biggest reason why this movie works out so well is due to how it finds a perfect balance, with basically everything in it. You could really say that the movie is being very heroic and patriotic but at the same time it also shows all of the flaws of the characters and how things went very wrong at times, due to human error or even sheer stupidity at times. The movie is balanced like this with about everything! The movie is a serious one and of course based on true stories but yet it is being brought as great entertainment, with also plenty of comical situations in it. The movie is never too dramatic or heavy but also never too goofy or comical. It's a real pleasant balance that works out oh so well for this movie.It's really great how this movie is telling an important true historical story, by telling it in a mostly very entertaining way. I believe that because of this, this movie works out 10 times better and more interesting, as it would had, had it been done as a complete serious and very straightforward 3 hour+ historical epic. It also gives The Right Stuff so much re-playability value to it! It's truly a movie you can watch over and over again and get grabbed by it every time.It's still really a respectful movie toward the first astronauts, as well as to the test-pilots of the '40's\/'50's, who pretty much were the predecessors of the first astronauts and did lots of important and dangerously groundbreaking stuff to get the first space program off the ground.It's equally paying attention to most of the first astronauts, as well as to test-pilot Chuck Yeager. It's hard to say who plays the lead role of this movie really, since there is not one main character, that it constantly follows, throughout the entire movie. It also follows the stories of the women behind the men, who of course were just as important and had to endure a lot.Basically all of the characters are really likable ones because they are portrayed like real humans, each with their own flaws and needs. It was refreshing to see real men as astronauts for a change. Men who enjoyed having a drink, the night before they had to go up into space, as opposed to all of the generic and serious scientists they are blasting off into space now days. It makes me respect the earliest astronauts all the more because they were just common men, who volunteered to do some not so very common things and constantly risked their own lives to get the job done. True pioneers of our time and also true heroes in my opinion.It's also great to see them getting played by some great and well known actors, who all suit their roles very well and also often really look like the person they are playing. It's really an all-star cast, with people such as Scott Glenn, Ed Harris, Sam Shepard, Dennis Quaid, Fred Ward, Veronica Cartwright, Pamela Reed, Lance Henriksen, Donald Moffat and Jeff Goldblum involved but it never feels like a celebrity overkill, since everyone suits their roles so extremely well.It's such a great written and fine told movie, not only by its actors but also really by its director Philip Kaufman, who directed the movie with a lot of eye for detail. I also really loved how I really couldn't tell when the movie was using real archive footage or footage shot specifically for the movie.

The Court Composer, Salieri (Abraham), admires the twenty-six year old Mozart with a passion and has written a little tune to celebrate his arrival at the court.Mozart is pleased and flattered. He asks if he can play it at the piano. He sits down and plays the simple ditty. Then, listening intently, he hits one of the chords again and again, and asks, That's a little off, don't you think? Shouldn't it go like this? Then he rips through the tune, deconstructs it, and does to it what Sonny Rollins did to I'm An Old Cowhand and Stan Getz did to Autumn in New York. Salieri looks on. His smile slowly fades into a frown. And the plot is set in motion. Salieri has slaved all his life to become a composer, driven by his love of music, in spite of his poor background and a father whose discouragements were strenuous.And here is this young punk, prodded on by a stern musician father, performing as a child before royalty, a prodigy, giggling maniacally, mocking him, rippling along and making Salieri's tune sound like something children might sing in Kindergarten.Salieri hates Mozart for being everything that Salieri is not. He plots against him, tries to knee-cap his career, spies on him, makes an attempt to steal his work even when Mozart is on his death bed, expiring in his mid-thirties. Salieri winds up telling the tale in flashback to a priest who visits him in the insane asylum in his old age.The curious thing is that Mozart really WAS a musical prodigy. He could play the piano when he was tall enough to reach the keys. He learned the violin. He wrote a minuet was he was eight and had his first symphony published as a prepubescent boy. A similar skill in mathematics shows up at a similar age. By the time Mozart was my age, he'd been dead for thirty or forty years. It's a sobering thought. Too sobering. Calls for a bit of single malt neat. Hold on a moment.There, that's better. Thank you. Those musical skills are obviously something constitutional. The subsequent opportunities to learn how to do it are adventitious. It's curious because it makes you wonder, if this ability isn't confined to a single culture, how many Mozarts have been born and died unrecognized among, say, the Australian aborigines. Not only didn't they have a stage father. They didn't know what a piano was. They had no instruments at all that allowed one to control the notes being played.It's also curious because neither musical talent nor skill in higher mathematics is measured on any of the usual intelligence tests. Psychologists tend to dismiss these skills as mere aptitudes or talents, as if calling them by a dismissive name discounts their importance. (The fact is probably that you can't measure them easily with a pencil and paper test.) Anyway, returning to the film, Abraham deserved his Academy Award, for what it's worth. He's quite good. So is Jeffrey Jones as the Emperor with the impenetrable expression and the eyes of a carp. Hulce and Berridge, who plays Mozart's wife Constanze, look the part but sound like two kids from Sherman Oaks. Hulce has the added disadvantage of speaking like Ryan O'Neal. I'm not certain that semi-deranged cackle was necessary -- we get the picture without it -- but okay.Most of Mozart's music that we see on the screen are excerpts from his operas. I was never a big fan of opera. But I suppose in a big splashy award-winning movie you must fill the screen with colorful display. What's the alternative? Have Mozart sit at the piano and play one of his breathtaking sonatas? Milos Forman must have learned from MTV that you can't even do that with Elton John.

","genre":"Biography, Drama, History"},{"date":"21 February 2012","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" There's a scene near the beginning when we are first being introduced to the horny and slightly zany Mozart (Hulce), when he enters the court of the Austrian Emperor, surrounded by outlandishly attired royalty, couturiers, chatelains, stewards, Knights of the Round Table, personal trainers, and shoe shine boys. The Court Composer, Salieri (Abraham), admires the twenty-six year old Mozart with a passion and has written a little tune to celebrate his arrival at the court.Mozart is pleased and flattered. He asks if he can play it at the piano. He sits down and plays the simple ditty. Then, listening intently, he hits one of the chords again and again, and asks, That's a little off, don't you think? Shouldn't it go like this? Then he rips through the tune, deconstructs it, and does to it what Sonny Rollins did to I'm An Old Cowhand and Stan Getz did to Autumn in New York. Salieri looks on. His smile slowly fades into a frown. And the plot is set in motion. Salieri has slaved all his life to become a composer, driven by his love of music, in spite of his poor background and a father whose discouragements were strenuous.And here is this young punk, prodded on by a stern musician father, performing as a child before royalty, a prodigy, giggling maniacally, mocking him, rippling along and making Salieri's tune sound like something children might sing in Kindergarten.Salieri hates Mozart for being everything that Salieri is not. He plots against him, tries to knee-cap his career, spies on him, makes an attempt to steal his work even when Mozart is on his death bed, expiring in his mid-thirties. Salieri winds up telling the tale in flashback to a priest who visits him in the insane asylum in his old age.The curious thing is that Mozart really WAS a musical prodigy. He could play the piano when he was tall enough to reach the keys. He learned the violin. He wrote a minuet was he was eight and had his first symphony published as a prepubescent boy. A similar skill in mathematics shows up at a similar age. By the time Mozart was my age, he'd been dead for thirty or forty years. It's a sobering thought. Too sobering. Calls for a bit of single malt neat. Hold on a moment.There, that's better. Thank you. Those musical skills are obviously something constitutional. The subsequent opportunities to learn how to do it are adventitious. It's curious because it makes you wonder, if this ability isn't confined to a single culture, how many Mozarts have been born and died unrecognized among, say, the Australian aborigines. Not only didn't they have a stage father. They didn't know what a piano was. They had no instruments at all that allowed one to control the notes being played.It's also curious because neither musical talent nor skill in higher mathematics is measured on any of the usual intelligence tests. Psychologists tend to dismiss these skills as mere aptitudes or talents, as if calling them by a dismissive name discounts their importance. (The fact is probably that you can't measure them easily with a pencil and paper test.) Anyway, returning to the film, Abraham deserved his Academy Award, for what it's worth. He's quite good. So is Jeffrey Jones as the Emperor with the impenetrable expression and the eyes of a carp. Hulce and Berridge, who plays Mozart's wife Constanze, look the part but sound like two kids from Sherman Oaks. Hulce has the added disadvantage of speaking like Ryan O'Neal.

This is one of my favourite films of all time. Not because it's a moving, meaningful, heart warming or terrifying film. It's a full on thriller with epic destruction scenes and a classic '50's storyline.I'll start with the bad. 1)It's a tad cheesy. Things that people say and some of the sequences are a bit clichéd, but it's easy to out aside. 2)The storyline is VERY predictable. Alien ships come along, BOOM, rebuild of forces and a big final battle. But hey, thats the storyline that's made some other great films, right?And now the good. Lots of it in fact... 1)It's utterly, incredibly, EPIC. The suspense of watching the ships arriving over the cities is really awesome. The destruction scenes are amazing. Watching everything get blown up is actually pretty cool. Sometimes, I just feel the need to watch those scenes again just for how epic they are. 2)The special effects are amazing. It just looks real. I'd dare say that some of it comes onto levels of which Avatar is on. It's scarily realistic. And it's quite a marvel to, with just how big the ships are. It's in your face and incredible to watch. 3)The storyline is a thriller. Suspense, action and a bit of romance. It's the usual Roland Emmerich. Each of the characters don't even know each other until these aliens come and destroy everything. While it's predictable, it's fun. Man throws everything it's got at the aliens, and then one simple phrase (catch a cold) changes everything. It's not entirely believable, but then again, the entire story is made up so little mistakes don't really matter. So, if you want an epic Sci-Fi thriller with amazing special effects, suspense and the best destruction scenes I have ever seen, this is the one for you. Don't take it seriously, it's not realistic.

I will admit that the movie is educating about the Japanese culture and lifestyle of the past and it has interesting and charismatic actors but the script has major gaps.

When they have already killed about three quarters of them and have stolen TWO of the THREE guns for some reason they start to panic and dramatize that they are all going to die the next day when the bandits do their final raid. By that time the villagers had suffered only a few casualties (not more than 10 as I could see) and most of the samurais were still alive.

Anyone who had suffered such losses would never make a final attack against more than a hundred men inside a fortified village who have two of the three guns on the battlefield. The way that the villagers acted though was as if they are doomed and this really irritated me. Hence the grade of 5. Apart from that, there were other minimal faults such as at the end where the bandit chief's gun fired two times in a matter of seconds which for that kind of gun is impossible but these are minor issues. The lack of simple logic when considering the battle is the major minus of this movie and ruins the whole experience of what would otherwise be a 7.3-7.4 picture. I cannot see why it is in top 20 and why there are so many amazing reviews of it being EPIC. It is everything else but it is not epic.

While I wouldn't go so far as to call it one of the greatest of all time, it is a vastly entertaining take on a brilliant premise that has been used throughout the decades sense. The dialogue is sharp, the character turns are believable and interesting and the whole thing flows along at a swift pace. When it was over I couldn't believe that so much time had gone by. I'm always fascinated by films that take place entirely in one location (or almost entirely) and this was one of the early precedents for the kind of greatness one can accomplish when that is utilized properly.The ominous surroundings like the heat and the storm add nice bits of tension to the rising tempers of the men in the room and the confrontations between the soft Henry Fonda and the explosive Lee J. Cobb were intense. Sidney Lumet is a man who earned his reputation as an actor's director and made his career out of mostly setting up the stage and aiding his actors in doing what they do best, but I think his stylistic choices here deserve to be commended. The way that he slowly brings the camera down over the course of the film, bringing us more intimately into the heart of this room, it adds that sense of claustrophobia that makes the tension even more gripping as we proceed into the later stages of it all.Practically everyone in the cast shines at one point or another, my favorites being the commanding Fonda who is able to be the voice of reason without being annoying, the pensive E.G. Marshall, the racist and volatile Ed Begley and the wise, determined Joseph Sweeney. The film had plenty of great twists, like the knife reveal, but my favorite scene had to be Begley going off on his offensive monologue while one-by-one the jurors turned away from him until he realized that his ignorance had caused him to lose any voice he once had; a powerfully real moment. I also loved the added touch of putting Fonda in an all white suit while everyone else was in shades of black or grey.

The film had plenty of great twists, like the knife reveal, but my favorite scene had to be Begley going off on his offensive monologue while one-by-one the jurors turned away from him until he realized that his ignorance had caused him to lose any voice he once had; a powerfully real moment.

The Killing is even more impressive because it was directed by a young 28-year old Stanley Kubrick with the confidence of a veteran, betraying on the surface, his passion for photography and on the content, for chess games.Indeed, The Killing displays a lot of technical novelties illustrating Kubrick's eagerness to make something new. The film is full of endless traveling shots where we goes from a room to another, conveying the feeling of a disturbed intimacy and contrasting with the crowd shots in the track races. The film plays as a self-reflexive demonstration of talent and perfectionism that would become the trademarks of the master, respecting the unity of space, time, and plot in a revolutionary three-dimensional way, with a plot, a plot within the plot, and the implacable and inevitable human factor. This doom is the key of The Killing's modernity that inspired such gangster classics as Reservoir Dogs and the intelligence of the story relies on the very fact that the failure is never due to hazard but to the very human factors on which the success of the operation depended too.Like a ingenuously constructed chess game, The Killing is governed by the same mathematical precision used for the plot, where each move counts and nothing is left for hazard. I wonder if Kubrick counted the length of the reels and knew his film wouldn't exceed 80 minutes, because it manages to get immediately to the essential the heist, and yet, takes time to deal with the characters and plunge us, through the dark and shadowy photography, in their intimacy. We progressively discover which part each one will play in the heist, which piece of the puzzle they are, a clever metaphor made by the narrator, conveying the notion of unity, as every action would obey to an established set of rules, hence the plot within the plot, the heist within the story.And the horse race heist is a template for criminal organization, whose audacity matches its ambition. Like in the o less glorious predecessor, John Huston's The Asphalt Jungle, the plan implies the use of many internal elements from a cashier clerk, Elisha Cook as George, to a cop and a barman, and some outsourcing Nikki, an isolated sharpshooter and Maurice, a ex-wrestler coming to divert the attention (two great performance from Timothy Carey and Kola Kwariani), two jobs that justifies the participation of a loan shark. The most crucial part of the heist is handled by a professional, Johnny Clay, remarkably played by Sterling Hayden. The first act is indeed a masterstroke of malicious perfectionism providing a feeling that won't be deceived in the following part.During the heist, Maurice must be handled by a group of cops who come from inside, letting George open the door to Johnny. Even a pawn can play vital part that's precisely where the thrills of the film relies on, we stop wondering how this masterfully prepared plan will work, but how it will not. And this is the second plot of the film which occupies all the emotional aspects, focusing on two Clay, the thief with principles and the weakling cashier who wants to buy affection for his bullying wife, a reminiscent of Edward G. Robinson's character in Fritz Lang's Scarlet Street.George is such a weak personality that all he does is in order to satisfy his wife, fatally ruins the plan. We already anticipate the failure, but it doesn't ruin the impact because The Killing is precisely about that, as there is no perfect murder, there is no perfect heist, and the more links it uses, the more likely it will be undermined by the weakest one, it's pure logistical logic. Nothing can be determined by a perfect timing, and if the characters respect the timetable, that's only because in their hearts, they're motivated by greed and personal motives. This is why the choice of featuring these characters in their ordinary life is crucial, while in today's films, it's mostly used for the most important protagonists.Greed is tricky, and if it's the very cause of the perfectionism that will govern the major plot's actions, to a degree of exactitude that certainly elevated the editing of The Killing to the level of genius, it's also the reason of the characters' fall. And in this gallery of despicable antiheroes, Johnny works as the mastermind, the voice of reason who has enough authority and diplomacy to deal with the team and to know how and where to act. In the iconic airport climax, when he knows the cops are coming at him, he can run but he knows it doesn't make a difference. Indeed, in a previous scene, when Timothy Carey's character tries to escape the police after shooting the horse, he's instantly killed. Unaware of the perfectionism that conducted the plan he took part of, he couldn't, like Johnny, believe in fatality.And this is the noir-theme dealt in The Killing, a sort of fatality that inspires all the revisionist questions, what if George didn't tell his wife? What if Johnny wasn't taken by the traffic jam? What if he took less money or bought too briefcases? Quickly, we understand that some things are meant to come, because nothing can be governed by pure rational logic when human factor is part of the game, let alone, when two million dollars are at stakes. Why did the plan fail, because it needed to rely on non-professionals who couldn't help but let themselves guided by their emotions.Believing the plan could work was as ludicrous as believing there is such a thing as honor among thieves.

Previously condoned behavior can suddenly become inconvenient and the soldier find him or herself the scapegoat.What I get from this superb movie is that sacrificing one's own beliefs and ,doing what you know to be wrong, because one's superiors say it's all right, is a dangerous thing indeed. It isn't worth it. Warfare is a grim activity. Killing and survival often are and holding on to one's ethics are often the only thing one may have. As I said earlier, danger for a soldier doesn't always come from the enemy, sometimes it comes from ones own. Never sacrifice your morals for politicians,they aren't worth it.

On the surface, it's about a young beautiful girl who'll get the Charming Prince thanks to something that makes her completely unique, but we all know it's the fairy tale definition of the wags to riches concept that paved the way to many underdog stories, providing hope for both women and men. Capra owes a lot to Cinderella, Rocky is a 'Cinderella' story and it's not surprising that such a feel-good tale ended up being adapted into the (how fitting) twelfth animated Disney film, in 1950.Now, is it accidental or logical that Walt Disney's Cinderella got itself the ninth place in the American Film Institute's Top 10 Animated films? I'm inclined to say both, not to diminish the merit of the film, but just to remind that there were many other Disney animated features that deserved this place, The Jungle Book, Sleeping Beauty to say the least, or how about The Little Mermaid or even a forgotten classic non-Disney film titled Gulliver's Travels? Yes, there is an interesting divergence between the film's recognition and cultural status and its content, which is relatively banal considering the glorious collection of animated masterpieces the Disney Studios provided. I'm not saying I'm not a fan of Cinderella, but I might be biased because my favorite version will forever be from Tex Avery, I'm talking of the legendary Swing Shift Cinderella, which always made me howl of laughter.I also was never a big fan of Disney princess-themed films, which I thought were too formulaic and never contributed to something new since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Anyway, I had the recent opportunity to watch both Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella and somewhere while viewing the second, I had to reconsider my opinion because something was strangely appealing to me I couldn't point my finger in. Was it Jacques and Gus, the funny little mice? Maybe. Was it the scene-stealing sequence featuring the Fairy Godmother, the pumpkin carriage and the unforgettable Boobiddy-boos? Probably. Or was it the intimidating Stepmother, Lady Tremaine and her shadowy bitchy look? Yes, I guess so. But still, we can find the same elements in other Disney classics. So I finally realized that the secret in Cinderella simply depended on the appeal of its titular character.In many aspects, Cinderella embodies the same condition than Snow White, but there is something fresh and modern in her personality that appears right in the first scene, she's not overly romantic and she doesn't take her work as a servant without detachment, even humor&#x85; where am I going with that? Simply that we never feel sorry for Cinderella, as she's not portrayed like a victim, something intelligently hinted in the early scenes. Take the first confrontation with the stepmother, when she's unfairly punished Cinderella's eyes betray a feeling of true anger, anything but a desire to cry. When she learns that she might be the bride, she's so hypnotized by love that a beautiful smile enlightens her face, and she looks incredibly sensual. Cinderella is modern by today's standards without the archetypal free- spiritedness disguising a real spoiled personality a la Ariel or Jasmine. Cinderella is modern because she is practical.This is important because the obligatory supporting characters fulfill their roles, the stepmother and her ugly daughters are the perfect contrast for Cinderella but the movie mostly works because it didn't forget to have a central character, realistic enough to inspire our empathy and needful enough to give the characters a moment to shine, whether it's from the precious help from the cute chipmunk-like talking mice or the providential help of Bruno, the brave dog. And another interesting thing about Cinderella is that for once, it doesn't need dragons, or killings to be entertaining, and although the last act is set in a house, it's an efficiently suspenseful climax, carried by the memorable character of the Grand Duke who's charged to try the shoes on every eligible girl.The Grand Duke is an important character not just for his comical pairing with the King, but also for the way he inspires the most evil action from the stepmother, when she makes him fall and break the shoe, her look says a lot about how she doesn't give a damn about one's life as one of the most truly despicable villains from a Disney film (who'd call a cat Lucifer anyway?) and coincidentally It also allows the heroine to own her by giving the other shoe, which was already proving that she was the one. The close-up on the stepmother's face at that very moment is the highlight of the film as it finally puts an end to Cinderella's torment. The film doesn't forget to be a fairy tale, yes it's all about the myth of the Charming Prince, but the key that forges Cinderella's appeal is that she's not a passive character.And they lived happily after &#x85; despite the predictable conclusion, Cinderella remains a timeless classic that gets in fact, better after each viewing, so there's no use to ask what the secret of Cinderella's charm is, the answer is in the question. It's precisely the unique charm of a universally, timelessly and (might I add) physically appealing character.
