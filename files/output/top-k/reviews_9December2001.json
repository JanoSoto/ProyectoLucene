[{"date":"9 December 2001","score":"","review":"  Shrek was the funniest cartoon since Toy Story 2. The plot of having Princess Fiona turning into the Ogre in the end was predictable, but yet, the movie was absolutely hilarious! Mike Myers as 'Shrek' was excellent, and I heard that his Scottish Accent earned him an extra 2-million dollars. Eddie Murphy as 'Donkey' was throw-back-your-head-and-cry funny. Cameron Diaz as 'Princess Fiona' was good, but was the most sophisticated part of the movie (well, obviously). She really could have put a little more character into her voice, but she did suit the part, didn't she? And who could forget John Lithgow as 'Lord Farquaad,' I mean, could it be any funnier? If you enjoyed Toy Story, and loved Toy Story 2, get off your butt right now, go to your closest video rental store, and for goodness sakes, WATCH THE MOVIE!!!!! I haven't seen the DVD yet, but I would recommend it as well. It is the best-selling DVD in history, with it's 11 hour bonus features!!
