But it's the subtext that holds the film together to its satisfactory resolution.This film is brilliantly directed. Unlike its three successors (especially the second and fourth installments of the series), this film knows that the alien will be much more terrifying if it's never actually seen in its entirety. It can be seen descending from the shadows or in horrifying ultra-close-ups, but you don't get the full body alien shot until very late in the film, making the perfect organism all the more mysterious and frightening. Many members of the ADHD generation claim that the movie is boring-- and that simply isn't true. Alien actually BUILDS to it's action-oriented sequences; it has much more to say and takes much less for granted than does its overblown sequel. During the first 'movement' of Alien, you're forced to contemplate the mechanics behind what exactly is happening to the crew of the Nostromo. The implications that a crew would be 'expendable' to a corporation has fundamentally TERRIFYING ramifications for an unsettling direction in which our society is headed. When Mother actually processes that particular transmission, you must reconsider what had been presented earlier-- and the results are not pretty.Veronica Cartwright gives a particularly affecting performance here. Of all the characters, she seems the most genuinely terrified as she attempts to understand why this horrible creature has come into her life. The other performances are all solid, if somewhat unremarkable, as well.Rating 8 out of 10. A classic, but it looks VERY dated-- unlike Aliens, the f\/x and the dialogue haven't held up particularly well. More character development would have given the film even more emotional impact and would have heightened the intensity of the otherwise well-developed theme. Tasteful restraint of gore. The direction of Ripley's final scene is especially dazzling. The second-best film in the series, just behind the gorgeous Alien 3.

I went to the theatre to see 'Stigmata', but it was sold out, so I bought my ticket for what I assumed would be Stigmata's poor cousin.  I was quite surprised to discover that 'Stir of Echoes' scared me more than any movie I've ever seen.  I've seen better movies, but never a more well-executed thriller.  It is a sleek, gripping bit of storytelling, and as such, it succeeds incredibly well.  I consider myself a fairly critical movie-goer, and find fault in most films, but this one had me on the edge of my seat.  Unlike 'Stigmata', which treats the audience like children, 'Stir of Echoes' delivers an intelligent presentation that will satisfy all but the most jaded of viewers.  If you don't like this movie, you either aren't a fan of supernatural thrillers, or you should stick to novels, because nothing can please you.The acting is impeccable, and Kevin Bacon will get consideration for a Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Tom, a Chicago working-class man who complains in the opening sequences that his life is hopelessly ordinary.  As the plot unravels along with his sanity, he only wishes he could have his regular life back.  But something deep inside him has been stirred, and he instinctively knows that he will never be able to guzzle beers and pass out on the couch like his average-guy neighbors again. Bacon seems so convincingly ordinary, and so deeply into character, that I saw glimpses of another magical actor, Ed Norton.  Bacon is even better in this movie than Norton was in American History X, for which he recieved a Best Actor nomination.Stir of Echoes works because it tells the story in a creepy, disjointed way, where you never know whether what you are seeing is a hallucination, a nightmare, or a psychic intuition.  As a result, you feel like you are losing your mind along with Tom, who, unlike most movie characters, doesn't feel compelled to verbally explain everything he is thinking for the benefit of the audience.  You feel like you are a fly on the wall, watching this once-ordinary man's life plunge down an abyss of wild confusion and maniacal obsession.'Stir of Echoes' will initially be overlooked a bit, as the bigger marketing budget for the moron-friendly 'Stigmata', and the inevitable comparisons to 'Sixth Sense' keeps moviegoers away in its opening weekend.  But it is a better movie than either of its two current rivals (although Sixth Sense joins it in a league apart from Stigmata), and word-of-mouth will help this movie gain steam in upcoming weeks.   8.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 September 1999","score":"","review":"  'Stir of Echoes' was a default viewing.

Spartan captures Phoenix, but Phoenix manages to frame him for the mass murder of the hostages.  Both men are sentenced to life imprisonment frozen forever in suspended animation.Cut to forty years later.  Los Angeles has become a new society (with many a wink and nod to Aldous Huxley's BRAVE NEW WORLD) in which violent behavior is completely unknown and human relations are strictly controlled to eliminate drugs, alcohol, unhealthy food, swearing, and even sex! (I guess the population is maintained by artificial insemination).  Suddenly, by some strange act of sabotage, Simon Phoenix is released.  The 21st century police, are, to put it mildly, unprepared to deal with a 20th-century criminal.  At the suggestion of policewoman Lenina Huxley (Sandra Bullock) John Spartan is thawed out and sent to catch Phoenix again.The comic sparks that fly as Spartan butts heads with this completely alien society are magnificent.  Every time Spartan curses, a machine issues him a ticket; Spartan's reaction to this problem is hilarious.  Bullock doesn't exactly show huge talent as Lenina Huxley, but she doesn't really need it to make this character funny and engaging, in love with her cliched and distorted vision of the 20th century just as some of us are with the Old West or the Age of Chivalry.  One of the running jokes is that she has not quite mastered the 20th-century jargon she loves to spout.  One of my favorite parts is a 20th-century telecast showing Spartan, who has just rescued a little girl from her kidnappers, being interviewed by a browbeating TV reporter; the response to this reporter is classic.  The script wisely does not call for Stallone to stretch his meager acting talents; he's funny just being who he is, so wildly out of place.Unfortunately, DEMOLITION MAN wants to be an action film, and the action scenes are every bit as bad as you would expect from a Stallone picture.  Some repellent violence (i.e. a de-oculation) is jarring and unjustified in this essentially humorous movie.  The fighting between Phoenix and Spartan is your usual collection of dumb one-liners and experienced gunmen missing each other constantly at short range with automatic weapons.  Snipes is a redeeming feature; he is obviously having the time of his life playing Phoenix, and is generally fun to watch.  His malevolent stare is sometimes quite scary.  It's a shame he wasn't given a bigger share of the comic material.DEMOLITION MAN is well worth renting for its brilliant original laughs.  The material is not new, of course, but the comic approach to it is.  This movie may not be MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, but a laugh is a laugh and you shouldn't be too proud to enjoy the laughs DEMOLITION MAN has to offer.  By no means should you see this movie on broadcast TV, as many of the best parts are routinely edited out.Rating ***1\/2 out of ****.

War time horrors, his films and a love affair he had with another soldier in the trenches begins to intrude into his world.\tHis monsters, particularly Frankenstein's monster played in those early films by Boris Karlof start to inhabit his waking dreams. His loved one David, (a God?) stands watching. James Whale is close to death.\tHe invites the gardener Clayton (Brendan Fraser) in and asks him to sit for a portrait. Clayton is homophobic, working class and at one of life's loose ends. Whale wants to talk and Clayton, fascinated by the stories, is prepared to listen.\tSo two complex characters interact, heightened by terrific performances from McKellen and Fraser as well as from Academy Award nominated Lynn Redgrave as the disapproving, loving, long term, Hungarian housekeeper for Whaley.I'm sure that Judi Dench who won the gong over Lynn Redgrave agrees that Hanna in Gods And Monsters, rather than Dench's Queen Lizzie in Shakespeare in Love was more worthy of the honour.\tThe photography from Stephen M. Katz is outstanding as is the music from Carter Burwell. Lolita Davidovitch as Clayton's girlfriend and Jack Plotnick as the film buff are memorable. The direction and screenplay from Bill Condon is superb. We have here a thought provoking, thoroughly delightful film.

That dialogue is witty, sassy and irresistible. Unfortunately, it is expressed by the film's villain. Cute, likeable remarks like that should be used to develop the good guy, especially if the good guy is Dudley Do-Right. The hero himself here is given no funny one-liners or likeable traits that train the audience except him as the happy go lucky protagonist. In result of giving the antagonist all the good material, I ended up rooting for the bad guy. The filmmakers seem to notice this concept and in result, for most of the production, the bad guy is the good guy and the good guy is the bad guy. Doesn't make much sense, does it. But movies like Dudley Do-Right have such little clue about what they are or where they are going, that this flaw is only the beginning of its troubles. The movie opens with three young kids playing together in a yard. One says that he wants to be a good hearted law enforcer one day. Another explains that he wants to be the villain, and takes the third, a girl whom they both have a crush on, and rides away on his bike after smashing a chocolate ice cream cone on the deputy wannabe's head. The characters grow up and become what they have always dreamed of being. Dudley Do-Right is a proud appointee living out in the country with his horse named horse. His old sweetheart, Nell Fenwick, knocks on his door one day. They sing each other a song. Romantic flares gloom.Everything is going well in Dudley's life until his old bully acquaintance, Snidely Whiplash, starts to deal out a sinister plan involving a false good rush, vampires, and blackmail--all which make Mr. Whiplash look like the good guy, and eventually turn Dudley into a bad guy--sort of. \t Already the plot is too deep for this kind of movie. Most of the cartoons which Dudley Do-Right is based on were simply and zany. The story is mostly explained to us by a comically annoying narrator who uses shapeless, undisciplined humor to provoke laughs in order to distract us from his bothersome presence. And to add some more proof of this film's plot failure, it is very hollow it never allows us to become involved simply because there is such little substance to it. No depth...just a bunch of nonsense characters doing screwball things to each other. \tAnother thing I found to the awful creditably to Dudley Do Right is the amazing lack of high energy excitement involved with the story, like that which was found earlier this year in movies like Inspector Gadget and My Favorite Martian. I was astonished with how little energy this movie actually had. Don't let the film's trailer or advertisements confuse you; this movie has such little excitement in it that I would still find it difficult to recommend to the youngest of children, it just won't hold their attention. And the few scenes that did energy felt stained and tired.   \tThere are a few funny moments in Dudley Do-Right, most of which come from concepts or ideas that are recycled and repeated. Coming from the creators of the dreadful George of the Jungle, (1997) the film obviously offers the same kind of humor repeatedly--Dudley hits his head on a floor board about a half dozen times throughout the production. Regardless, the laugh inspiring material here is not enough to even waste a dime on.I liked the performance from Alfred Molina, as the villain, Snidely Whiplash. He offered the kind of character needed in Big Daddy, which was starved for a bad guy. Brendan Fraser has been in several movies this year, without even having a hit. Blast From the Past failed in the box office, The Mummy was unconvincing, and now, this flop, which is such a useless worthless waste of time it doesn't even know how to develop its main hero, and the tittle is taken from his name. At times in this film Dudley Do-Right asks his horse for advice in life threatening situations and at others he blasts his initials in a fortress with a tommy gun he is beholding. Its is too serious for kids and too childish for adults. All of this and one wonders why Disney did not bring us this family entertainment--after all, it seems like their style. I think they probably were offered this film, but had higher standards than it. Universal bought the rights, along with the pain and suffering they will most likely feel long after the reviews and box office totals are in. They will have to live with their decision--for the rest of their lives. Brought to you by Universal Pictures.
