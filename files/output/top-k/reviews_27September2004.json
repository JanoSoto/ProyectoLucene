I admit that I love Kevin Costner movies, I live for\/love baseball, I grew up on the Tigers and I was going through a similar relationship situation so this movie included so many things that were personal to me. I wasn't disappointed. And unless it's so glaringly obvious, I'm not one to analyze a movie to death. All I can say is what a wonderful story and very well written. It had a bit for everyone really. Sports mixed with romance but not so much that one overshadows the other. They balanced and blended well. I loved this movie enough that when my first 2 copies disappeared I bought it on DVD and put it away. Definitely an addition to the spring training ritual of nothing but baseball movies til the season starts.  ","genre":null},{"date":"27 September 2004","score":"","review":"  OK.

OK now to get to the praising. The character Iron Monkey is a very cool and heroic character that is very convincing helping all these poor people get the money and shelter that they rightfully deserve. Donnie yen who us Americans most likely only know as Snowman from Blade 2 also stars in this great film. The action and fights that everyone is most likely seeing the movie for are everything you would expect from China or Japan (not sure where this is from) The fights are a little far-fetched but movies are not supposed to be realistic and those far-fetched things add to the fun of this very very stylish and entertaining movie. Aside from the action there is a few laughs along the way that again add to the fun of this extraneously cool film. The action is spread out at the beginning but as time presses on it becomes non-stop and it is all good. Now I must say one thing.....Some of the fights kind of get monotonous. Let me say this the repetitive nature of 2 things (kicking objects back and forth at each other and throwing stuff and kicking it before it hits them) would have DOOMED any other film but not Iron Monkey the repetitive moves are not a negative thing since it is still cool and they do kick and throw different objects each time. My GradeA it is just another example of how China and\/or Japan KNOW HOW TO MAKE GREAT MOVIES  ","genre":null},{"date":"27 September 2004","score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":"  Now before I start praising this movie I would like to say that although there are a few things in common, Crouching tiger and Iron monkey are very different.

It was OK, but not as great as I'd remembered. The real treasure was Mayim Bialik, who would later star in Blossom, and did a terrific Bette impersonation, complete with excellent singing (at least, I think it was her).The plot was kind of hard to follow in parts, but basically ended up being like a lesbian version of Love Story, without any actual lesbianism. I thought Love Story was cheesy, and so was this. But it did manage to evoke tears at the sad parts, even though I found most of the characters annoying. (Bette was annoying but lovable, the rest were just annoying.)If this movie had been made today, there probably would have been a lesbian romance, and it would have made a better story. As it is, it's a harmless sideshow, if you're a fan of Bette or Blossom, or if you're just dying to find out the original context of the song Beneath My Wings. Otherwise, skip it.
