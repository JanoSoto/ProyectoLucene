They expect to repeat the experience of the previous generation who conquered the French in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. As the war drags on in the disease-plagued trenches of Europe, the youths come face to face with the cruelty of war. Before long, they realize that the bravura of going to war is a total mirage and the war isn't going to be short and sweet. The story shows the reaction on the German side but the onset of war was received in much the same on the British side with people reacting in a frenzy of false hope for a quick victory over the Huns, only to come face to face with the reality of a lengthy war. This movie is a very sober view of that war, made 12 years after WW I was concluded. It was awarded an Academy Award for best picture and Lew Ayres was named the best actor.While the dialogue, imagery and acting deliver a strong anti-war message, the script is flat and the movie seems staged. It also shows a great unease among soldiers in battle. The dialogue of the soldiers is unashamedly anti-war. It seems highly unusual that men in battle would allow themselves this luxury with discussions about the merits of war during their timeouts on the battlefield. Can soldiers adopt this mindset and still fight effectively? We even see the leading character, Lew Ayres, nurse and talk to the French soldier he has shot in battle. While this movie conveys the reasons for not waging war, it doesn't take into account the fact that people in the warring countries of Europe were fired by nationalism and the belief that they were acting in their country's interest. Soldiers have to at least rationalize their mission or turn a blind eye to any doubts they might have.  I have never fought in a land war or any other kind of war so I can only surmise how people might react.

Repression screws you up, man. That's why they're screwballs. To get the humor requires a level of maturity and knowledge that most teenagers simply don't possess.

In fact even though director Mr. Harlin would prove three years later that he has a talent for the mindless action movie genre with Cliffhanger, his gift is only present in a budding form here and it's not quite enough to save the picture.The first Die Hard pitted Mr. Willis against a pack of robbers posing as terrorists inside of a Los Angeles skyscraper. The sequel has him going horn-to-horn and fist-to-fist with a bunch of political fighters who have swept up control of an international airport. Turns out, the terrorists, led by William Sadler, want to salvage their leader, who is flying in on his way to prison, until Mr. Willis once again slides by unnoticed and begins to slowly foil their plans.Had a better director, such as the original creator John McTiernan, helmed this one and a sharper, more focused screenplay been constructed been hired for the job, Die Hard 2 would have probably resulted in being a more-than-satisfying successor. A sequel that works, in other words. But as it is, it seems like a watered down version of the said product. One of the things that made the first Die Hard work was an assortment of witty dialogue, a lot of them punch lines that amazingly enough seemed to come off quite naturally from the characters, as if that were the way people really talked. Even though the screenplay for Die Hard 2 was put together by one of the same men, Steven E. de Souza (and another man, Doug Richardson), that flow of dialogue does not work. The screenplay is almost entirely made up of punch lines and it seems so much more artificial, so much more contrived and mechanical. As does the major plot twist that occurs in the third act. Potentially exciting, but coming across as flat and devoid of shock. But even the human elements, involving in the first, are dull here. Mr. Willis is still very charismatic and inspiring of sympathy, but he has no real dynamics with anybody in the movie. No connection with his wife (Bonnie Bedelia), no real animosity with the airport police chief (Dennis Franz), no real sense of friendship with the L.A. cop who saved his life before (Reginald Veljohnson), and no interesting villains to go up against. As the terrorist leader, Mr. Sadler gives an over-the-top, phony-feeling performance, surprising from an actor who is usually so reliable and his scenes are almost entirely just detritus, especially that completely laughable introductory moment where we see him playing martial arts in front of his television set, buck naked. He's no baddie compared to Alan Rickman. It's almost hilarious that the one character that Mr. Willis has the most interesting chemistry with is a rent-a-car airport employee (Lauren Letherer) with whom he shares a simple five minutes.But even as a mindless thriller, the movie falls flat. Mr. Harlin would get better in time, but he shows very little skill for action here. The shootouts, fist fights, explosions, and plane crashes are all handled and photographed rather clumsily. A particularly bad sequence involves Mr. Willis dodging bullets fired from overhead by barrel-rolling across a hard metal floor. Shot in slow-motion and with far too little sparks to simulate bullet impacts, the sequence looks like a lackluster, ham-handed imitation, or even a training exercise video. Not that any person would be dumb enough to try and avoid incoming bullets that way as opposed to getting on their feet and bolting for cover. But most embarrassing is when Mr. Willis escapes from an exploding airliner by ejecting himself through the pilot's escape hatch. The scene is shot from above, with Mr. Willis being projected toward the screen and screaming in a way that makes it seem like a Die Hard parody instead of a solemn action-thriller.

Although this is not happen the robbery went very wrong and ended up being very bloody. The men who were in the mob went but nick names and they were colors. The men met back at a warehouse where everyone was blaming each other for spilling to the cops. Little did everyone know that Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) was the undercover cop. The main theme to the movie was about loyalty and friendship. Through out the movie these members were blaming and torching each other and forgot that none of that mattered. In the end Joe showed up to the shop and knew exactly that Mr. Orange was an undercover cop and wanted to kill him. Although Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) believed that this was impossible because he took a bullet for him. This ended in a bloody fight because everyone was so upset and angry and Mr. Orange admitted he was a cop and everyone ends up dead. It's a bloody mess. This shows that no matter how angry you are with someone death will not help the situation. This film is very similar to the movie raging bull where Jake LaMotta ended up with nothing in the end. Both of the movies they think that they are going to get the things they want and be happy. Money can't buy you happiness although many people believe that is all you need. In both of the movies they end up with nothing in the end, the only thing they have is hurt and hatred towards each other. One of the scenes that showed different camera angles and lighting was when Mr. Blonde was torching the police officer that they had held hostage. You could see him torching the police officer and in the background you could see Mr. Orange getting upset. It made you wonder what was going to happen next. I thought Mr. Orange was not even conscious and he woke up and shot Mr. Blonde. Another scene where you see the lighting change is the final scene when Joe comes in and is very upset and sees the men lying on the floor. You can see everyone and everything around that is making him upset. It slowly zooms in on Joe, his son, and Mr. White. The film crew also managed to show when they each shot each other. This brought the movie to the final scene with Mr. White and Mr. Orange. Reservoir Dogs is a movie that shows no matter how much you think something is worth ruining your friendship over it is not worth it.

Corporate America was being fully created and it's interesting to see that bit of history before what the economy is today. But in the 80's it was all about being a player and becoming a huge success. Wall Street truly captures the time and is one of Michael Douglas's defining roles as the villainess Gordon Gekko. I saw a clip of Wall Street in my film class a few years ago and for some reason even though it seemed interesting to me, I never got to see it. Thankfully I found Wall Street in my mom's DVD collection and watched it today. It's interesting to see a film like this where you see the original idea developed before a bunch of later movies ripped off the rise and fall plot. Wall Street is a powerful movie that shows you the rise of the wealthy and how they still look down on the honest hard working people, so quick to make a quick buck no matter who they hurt.Bud Fox, a junior stockbroker, is desperate to get to the top. He wants to become involved with his hero, Gordon Gekko, a ruthless and legendary Wall Street player, whose values could not conflict more with those of Bud's father Carl, a blue-collar airline maintenance and union president. Bud visits Gekko on his birthday and, granted a brief interview, pitches him stocks, but Gekko is unimpressed. Realizing that Gekko may not do business with him, a desperate Bud provides him some inside information about Bluestar Airlines, which Bud learned in a casual conversation from his father. A dejected Bud returns to his office where Gekko places an order for Bluestar stock, becoming one of Bud's clients. But Bud learns that there might be more to greed than he expected.Michael Douglas delivers a powerful performance as Gekko, the way he plays Fox and uses him was just brutal. Everyone wants to be rich, everyone wants to be successful, but at what cost? Gekko is the ultimate example of someone who will not only buy and sell you, but step over your body to get the cash. His speech of greed was so on key and powerful that I could understand why the people were so quick to go to his side of things. Greed is good, maybe in some ways that's true, it just depends on what you do to succeed. Charlie Sheen pulls in a good performance as well bouncing off of Douglas and you truly feel for his character because we have all been in his shoes. At the glimmer of a rich future, it sounds good to be bad, but when he realizes that he's hurting his own father and business, maybe it's not worth it, he's just Bud Fox.Wall Street is a great movie that was ahead of it's time and still remains a powerful movie to this day. The ultimate betrayals and to show that you can't trust anyone in the business world still holds. Oliver Stone really captured the excitement and downfalls of Wall Street perfectly; you can tell that New York is his city. Wall Street defines the 1980's very well when it was the rise of the get rich quick schemes.

But this film is a bland, somber, melancholic chat fest that demands that its audience forget everything its ever heard about or seen of or actually experienced at a disco. It's beyond stupid. The whole premise is flawed, that disco died in the early eighties - it didn't, it mutated into an even more frantic, outrageous club scene. But this true fact doesn't deter the film's creators from their inaccurate pointless fantasy.A couple of discos may have closed down or changed style in Manhattan but clubs where people danced were actually even more popular and numerous. The celebrity glitz factor may have faded, but the intense social scene was charging ahead. Cocaine was everywhere by the bucket fulls at the time, not just up Hollywood's noses, and the nightlife was running hot on its power. It was insane, deranged, unbelievable. But this dumb flick wants you to believe that a whole world was collapsing, that an entire generation of party animals quickly went extinct. Wrong.If this movie is meant to be a comment on the virus like spread of Reagonomics into every aspect of American culture throughout the 80s, then having a grand Disco as the setting pretty much mandates that the film be a broad parody. But it isn't, it's just a self conscious exercise in style. But even the style is wrong. Power suits and ties wouldn't be fashionable till the next decade. No real urban hipster in the 80's would be seen dead in a pinstripe. Designer jeans were what the heavy weights were sporting, even the upper crust. So the look is off, which leaves the substance to carry the project. What substance there is is vacuous, vapid, and very annoying.The dialog is all stilted, awkward and overly literate - unnatural. It's like listening to a lit student read his or her first script. The acting is uneven and unfocused. No one seems to know what the point of this movie is, and all the talk and gestures don't add up to anything greater than themselves. It's just a series of smugly clever comments and shallow observations, but there's no direction to any of it.

While this is certainly a bad movie it's still far from one of the worst ever made. The film's simple story involves a missionary worker (Madonna) who hires an American (Sean Penn) stranded in China to locate some missing opium that needs to be used for medical reasons. The two end up in one shady place after another and running into corrupt cops, gangsters and countless double-crossers. SHANGHAI SURPRISE certainly is a surprise because it features Sean Penn, one of the greatest actors of the past thirty-years, in such a bad performance that one really needs to consider it one of the worst performances by any great actor in the history of cinema. I really can't think of one good thing to say about the performance other than it's so bad that it gives the film the only reason to be viewed because as a major fan of his I can't help but admit that I was drawn into the movie simply because of how bad it was. This might seem crazy to say but had Penn's performance been somewhat better I think the film would have been even worse and nearly impossible to get through. While Penn's performance is bad, what really kills this movie is the lackluster direction by Jim Goddard who doesn't seem to know what type of movie he wants to make. There's no question that this is a rip-off of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARC but the problem here is that the action doesn't work, the comedy isn't funny and there's simply no adventure or characters to care about. This movie is incredibly lifeless from the first sequence to the very last one and even when we do get an action scene it's so poorly put together that you can't help but yawn. The screenplay has so many plot holes that you can't help but quit trying to figure out anything going on and things only get worse as more and more characters are dragged into the mess. We've already established that Penn's not very good here but the same goes for his then-wife Madonna. I've never been one to overly bash here and while the performance isn't the best, you can't overlook this because she's not an actress. At least she can say that she out-performed the future two-time Oscar-winner. Richard Griffiths has a small supporting role and is one of the few good things. Ex-Beatle George Harrison was the executive producer of this thing and he co-wrote the score and performed the songs. The score isn't too bad but it doesn't fit the film too well and none of the songs are all that memorable.

Neither film stands alone as satisfactory because, obviously, it would be incomplete, and naturally, is also important that the two halves be viewed in sequence.

The other, devout Christian and proud Scot raised in China, Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), seems to have the ability to leave anyone he races against in his wake. One is racing against prejudice, the other for the God he believes gave him the ability to run. But with the Americans dominating the sport, do they have a chance at taking the gold medal?Because of the amount of times I've seen this film lampooned, with the use of its music played over something in slow-motion, I was expecting this film to have become a parody of itself. I was not expecting something as brilliant and profoundly moving as I did experience. From the opening scene that depicts the main characters running along the beach in slow-motion to that score, I was hooked. How a film that begins in 1919 and is steeped in period detail can work with a very 80's synthesised score is beyond me, but it works wonderfully, and was a massive risk that is pulled off.Slight historical inaccuracies and tweaks from the sake of narrative aside, the film strongest point comes in its authenticity. For all the films that try and look wonderful in the period dress and detail, few actually feel like its set in the time. For example, Gangs Of New York, was gorgeous and I'm sure the costumes and sets were very accurate, but it always feels like you're watching actors on a set. Chariots Of Fire convinces while seeming effortless, with the clothes and props having a 'lived-in' feel.Apart from the visual delights, there are the two leads who both went criminally unrecognised at the Academy Awards. Ben Cross is all steely determination and frustrated rage as Abrahams, who is the inferior runner to Liddell. And Ian Charleson, a celebrated stage actor who tragically died nine years after this film was made, is just a naturally fine actor who plays the devout Christian Eric Liddell with such an ease and intelligence that he deserved an Academy Award nomination at the very least. But those Oscar voters don't get it right very often, although the film did bring home Best Picture.It has been criticised for its inaccuracies. Lord Lindsay didn't exist and is a stand-in for the real-life Lord Burghley, and Aubrey Montague attended Oxford, not Cambridge.

They are others too, but, to me, this is a film about two great sportsmen using their ability to speak for what they believe in. If you want an accurate account of what actually happened, you can read a biography or look on Wikipedia. The film makes changes for more power and to get its point across, while keeping the majority of the true-life story correct.A wonderfully intelligent film that is packed with great performances, stunning cinematography, and subtle period detail, with a distinct Britishness about it that seemed to have been lost in the 1960's.

The whole theme of don't look away was good for the action, in my opinion. I feel as if the jerking, oblique and changing camera usage found in most modern action films, takes away from the action, not improving on it. There would be a single-camera throughout a whole fight scene which added to the realness of the action.

As discussed, cinematography for the fight scenes was great a 'less-is-more' situation for me. I loved the camera angle - for when the two houses slowly approach each other, unwilling to fight - as the Samurai watches like a god from above. The camera was often far away from the subject, which gave me a feeling as if I was more in the film than any other film I've seen before.The Western feel throughout the samurai film was portrayed through its art direction. The art director did an extremely good job with the city and roads, the single-street town with the occasional tumble-weed gave off the old standoff feel. Other western elements would be with the two sides fighting against each other, and the lone-ranger only looking out for himself, and oddly the good of the people.The film has a good story line. Although, the film has a fairly predictable main story with side points that cause some confusion yet a good amount of mystery and a closer look into the main character's morals. The main character is similar to any good action movie character, quiet, strong, and with a sense of justice for the common people.Kurosawa's one of my new favorite directors; directing, Yojimbo, Seven Samurai, Ikiru, Kagemusha, and Ran.

I greatly recommend Yojimbo for anyone who is looking for a good action movie and doesn't have too many graphics or gives you a headache from oblique camera shots during fight scenes.

In fact, it's actually a pretty good escapist adventure romp along the lines of an Indiana Jones movie.I watched this movie for the first time just recently, as I was scared away from viewing it all those many years prior, simply because of all the negative hype surrounding it - the hype that said it was a real stinker.

This movie stars Sidney Poitier as John Prentice, Katharine Houghton as Joey Drayton, Spencer Tracy as Mr. Drayton, Katharine Hepburn as Mrs. Drayton, Roy Glenn as Mr. Prentice, and Beah Richards as Mrs. Prentice. The movie was well put together movie for its time. In 1967, guess who's coming to dinner brought to life the reality of interracial couples. Joey Drayton and John Prentice is a couple that is in love and wants everyone to know about it. The only hurdle is the fact that everyone may not feel the same way about them being a couple as they do because of the race barrier. Joey is a Caucasian woman who all her life has been taught to treat everyone fairly no matter what color they are, and John is an African American man that is well accomplished and does not think of himself as an African American man but as a man, period. The plot thickens as the Joey and John introduce their newfound love for each other to their parents.The overall theme of the movie is acceptance or overcoming racism. There may be some things that your child may feel that he or she should be able to do, and may look for your support an acceptance. As long as the thing that he or she is doing is not causing harm or injustice to anyone and brings them peace, acceptance is in order. The fact that everyone is not on board with Joey and John's decision is very clear, beginning with the African American maid that Mr. and Mrs. Drayton have in their home. The angle of the camera could give a clear expression of how she feels. The camera tilts to the side as she tells John how she feels about him being a black man wanting to take a white woman for a wife. This was a great way to shoot the scene because her discomfort of the situation and the angle of the camera worked well together. The Irony in the movie is that the glory of love is constantly playing in the background, and no one seems to understand the glory of love until the end of the movie.Quite naturally a parent wants the best for their children and Mr. and Mrs. Drayton are great examples of this. This of course is not to say that the decision that Joey is making is one that is a bad one, but the timing of it all is totally off. When Joey breaks the news to her parents they have only a day or two to come up with a decision and that is really unfair to them. Raising children is not an easy job, but when you know that you have done the best that you can do, the only thing that you can do is accept them.

Mistaken identity is the theme of this classic from Alfred Hitchcock. Cary Grant stars as Roger Thornhill, a twice divorced mama's boy who is mistaken for a government agent. The film chronicles his adventures as he runs across the country trying to stay one step ahead of the bad guys. Of course, as in almost every Hitchcock thriller, there is the beautiful blonde distraction. In North by Northwest, Eva Marie Saint is the stunning Eve Kendall. Is Eve just a random girl Roger Thornhill met or does she have hidden motives? Will Roger Thornhill ever clear his name and prove he is not George Kaplan? Will the bad guys win? This movie keeps you entertained throughout all 131 minutes.Hitchcock use a subjective point of view in his cinematography. An example of this is when Roger Thornhill finds himself trying to escape an auction house. The camera focuses on Roger Thornhill and then to various people in the building before focusing on Roger Thornhill again. This allows you to see their reactions as if you were in the room and were looking around yourself. Roger Thornhill is now a desperate and broken man as a result of this mistaken identity and the camera angles create an emotional bond with him. Every word he speaks is judged by the crowd and you feel their pity or scorn. This type of cinematography seems to be used frequently by Hitchcock and he makes good use of it.Another technique used by Alfred Hitchcock in this film is use of visible sounds. The sound effects match objects and situations that are on the screen. In the scene leading up to the iconic airplane scene, Roger Thornhill is standing by the side of the road. He looks in the distance and you see and hear a plane. Then he looks to the side and you see and hear a car. This use of sound effects adds to the drama of the film. Is the plane out to get Roger Thornhill or is it the car? Is Thornhill finally going to clear his name or will this just be another situation he has to escape from? Once again Alfred Hitchcock uses the camera to really create an emotional bond with the characters on the screen.I love Cary Grant's brilliant way of mixing serious and comedic situations. He is the ultimate gentleman with his perfect suit and not a hair out of place while dealing with hilariously impossible situations. Another Cary Grant film I'd recommend with a similar theme is Arsenic and Old Lace.There are some hidden gems in this film as well. As in all of Hitchcock's films, Alfred Hitchcock makes a cameo. It's always an extra bonus to find the famous director in his films. There is also a hilarious blooper by a young extra in background of the restaurant scene near the end of the film.

He looks in the distance and you see and hear a plane. Then he looks to the side and you see and hear a car. This use of sound effects adds to the drama of the film. Is the plane out to get Roger Thornhill or is it the car? Is Thornhill finally going to clear his name or will this just be another situation he has to escape from? Once again Alfred Hitchcock uses the camera to really create an emotional bond with the characters on the screen.I love Cary Grant's brilliant way of mixing serious and comedic situations. He is the ultimate gentleman with his perfect suit and not a hair out of place while dealing with hilariously impossible situations. Another Cary Grant film I'd recommend with a similar theme is Arsenic and Old Lace.There are some hidden gems in this film as well. As in all of Hitchcock's films, Alfred Hitchcock makes a cameo. It's always an extra bonus to find the famous director in his films. There is also a hilarious blooper by a young extra in background of the restaurant scene near the end of the film. You may have to watch the scene a few times to find what I'm talking about.Mistaken identities were never more thrilling or humorous than this classic partnering of Hitchcock and Grant.

I'm only considering these four stars due to the impact and international success it had back when released. To begin, the acting is pretty bad. It's amazing how Michelle Gellar and Ryan improved in Cruel Intentions, because here their acting is weak. Prinze Jr's is even worse, and now I understand why Scary Movie portrayed Ray as gay. He really looks gay here. And who'd thought Leonard from Big Bang Theory was in this film.. I had no idea. The scenes are all very very predictable, I could say what was going to happen even thought this is my first time seeing this (believe it or not). It seems that everybody in this film is blind, deaf and skeptical, like that policeman. When she screamed HE IS THE GUY or something like that, the cop instead of putting his gun in hands, he preferred to look back for thousand seconds (and die, of course). The only thing to like about this film is the directing and the background sound, that fortunately (or at least) deliver some tense moments. Aside that, it's a big disappointment.
