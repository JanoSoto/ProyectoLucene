I wasn't expecting much, because the back of the DVD shows are not at all representative of the film. Anyway, I'm a fan of sci-fi, so I decided to give it a chance.I have to honestly say, I was surprised at how well done this film is. The plot is surprisingly developed, and there were some twists and turns along the way to maintain the interest of the viewer. Some of the lines could be considered cheesy, but these moments were isolated and were mild compared to the culture of one-liners and insincere babble that the mainstream audiences accept out of the Hollywood trend setters.Much of the dialogue was actually plausible, and well delivered by a competent cast. Freddie Prinze, Jr. looked like he was still shaking off the remnants of a trendy teenage mindset, but he was adequate. In fact, he's a new cadet. It's no wonder he would still be somewhat immature. Mathew Lillard's character is somewhat unlikable, but well-acted, and has some redeeming qualities at the same time. I think that was the while point. Tchéky Karyo delivers a brilliant, emotional performance. I wasn't familiar with this actor before but he is amazing.As far as the mechanics of the film, it presents space fighting and space scenarios in a deep and intriguing manner. The good special effects helped to make it believable. The solid plot was garnished by some tense moments that seemed almost influenced by Wolfgang Peterson's landmark Das Boot. Throughout the film, Roberts brought about quite a bit of philosophical and historical content. This material was quite expertly woven throughout the film, and is tied tightly with the ending of the film as well. For that, he deserves many points. Because it's something that mainstream Hollywood seems to not be able to get right after all these years of practice.Overall, I would recommend this for any sci-fi fan. Sadly, good sci-fi films are always underrated by the mainstream audiences. Even more sad is that there aren't enough quality films in this exceptional genre. We're handed these silly, insulting films something like The Day Robots Pummeled the Earth. Or else films that are completely tethered by poor special effects. Or we're handed a world that is set up in a very deliberate, expert manner, then expected to accept the fact that anything goes, no matter how ridiculous or silly the film unfolds after the halfway point, like in Event Horizon. Those types of film give the genre a terrible reputation, and Wing Commander certainly stands out as a superior film amongst all the garbage producers try to pass off as sci-fi. It's a definite recommend for sci-fi fans. 8\/10 as a film.

That was enough to dissuade me from actually watching it for a long time. When I finally watched it, though, I found it deeply moving, despite my negative expectations. Yes, it's practically an exercise in non-stop emotional manipulation. Some of it is so heavy-handed that even a softie like me could see it coming and sidestep it. Still, there are other scenes that affect me every time, even after many viewings. There are moments of pride, humor, loneliness, gratitude, fear, heartache, and joy, moments that are true down to the bone, even though the film is obvious fantasy.Still, it took me a long time to embrace this movie. Forrest did indeed have a low IQ, and is indeed held up as an American hero, and at first I had trouble with that, just as others did. Our culture has suffered enough dumbing down without popular films promoting stupidity as a positive thing. Also, the character of Jenny was problematic for me, enough to keep me ambivalent about the whole movie; Gump's love for her was almost pathetic and she never seemed to grow in understanding. Forrest offers his heart each time they meet, and each time she leaves him behind without explanation or apology, even after the conception of Forrest Jr., when it seems that she has finally gotten her act together. Ultimately, she only returns when she knew her time was nearly ended.Through the years, I came across Forrest Gump occasionally on cable and I would give it another try. I tired of the historical CGI, inserts, and other pop culture jokes pretty fast; they were mildly entertaining the first time around, but after that they seem like they're just in the way, serving only to space out the really meaningful scenes in order to let you catch your breath. But, oh, those good moments... I knew I had to get past my reservations and figure out why I loved this movie. And finally I have.First, I realized that the review I referred to earlier was wrong. Gump's limited intelligence is not presented as his strength; it's simply a fact of his life that allows the plot to develop in a certain way. It also makes him a more balanced character, since everything else about him is so exceptionally good; his low IQ is a device that allows us to relate to him on a more equal level. The proof that intelligence is not denigrated by this film is the very moving scene when Forrest inquires about his son, fearing that he passed on his only source of (unearned!) shame to his offspring. (IMO, this single scene is good enough to justify Hanks' Oscar.)No, this film isn't about the thing Forrest lacks; it's about the things that he has, and he has them in spades honesty, generosity, loyalty, honor, integrity.The most moving story line, for me, is that of Lieutenant Dan. Forrest saves his life twice, first physically, by dragging him away from a firefight in Vietnam, and then spiritually, by being a beacon for Dan, a lighthouse leading him from a tempest of self-destructiveness to a haven of sanity and peace. I cannot watch Dan's arrival in Bayou le Batre, or walking at Forrest's wedding, without tears.Jenny? Yes, she fails to appreciate Forrest's better qualities too often. But there is some explanation for her behavior towards the end of the film, and in that light I've decided to cut her some slack. Again, the film just isn't about Jenny's failings, but Forrest's loyalty.So, after all this time, I'm happy to finally rate this film... 10\/10.

It sounds like something a mob of bored students would do for a joke, but it forms the basis of some very creepy substories. In today's world, where Hollywood has to mine foreign markets for the ideas to make a horror film, Flatliners is one of those rare gems that show Hollywood can make something different when it tries hard enough.What separates Flatliners from a lot of films based on this premise that would come out today is that it does not stoop to being condescending or arrogant. Flatliners recognises that people go to films to be entertained, not moralised to. In this kind of supernatural thriller, the difference this restraint makes is really incredible. What's even more incredible is that Julia Roberts appears without being annoying or demonstrating that she can only play Julia Roberts. The theory of obscurity, that performing artists do their best work with the smallest audience, is in force here.The subplots concerning what the characters find during their loss of pretty much everything that makes them alive, and how it comes back to intrude on their present time, are done surprisingly well. The moments when William Baldwin's character finds his personal videotape collection coming back to haunt him are especially intriguing. That William Baldwin seems so perfectly cast in the role says a lot either about the script or the direction. I am not sure which.Kiefer Sutherland, on the other hand, really shines as the lead. One really feels for him as the mystery of what past experience is intruding on the present and why unfolds. As Kevin Bacon's character goes to find an old school pier whose life he made hell and tell her how sorry he is, it becomes clearer what the film is about. We can try to change the past as much as we like, but it's what we do with the present that matters most.Another good aspect of Flatliners is how it achieves an atmosphere without the use of expensive, elaborate visual effects. Quite unusually for what is essentially a horror film, Flatliners did not expend its budget in places where it did not need to. Much of what we see during the more surreal sequences is a case of professional pretending, simple trick photography, or stock footage.

But every once in awhile, I try to check out something in the hope that things have changed.This was not a movie that met my hopes. Frankly, I was irritated by this movie from the opening narration, full of the sort of sad melancholic gay me, outcast as a child with Mom my only friend, unable to really connect as an adult which has made my life sort of sad, but I try to joke my way through the pain narration that should have dropped out of gay art years ago, along with pink feather boas and bad Judy Garland impersonations.There's nothing HORRIFIC about this movie -- it just plods along its relatively predictable path, occasionally stopping to underscore silly or offensive clichés like the gay man with the fag had best friend, or the older gay gentlemen and his loud and crass sexual double-entendres or the standard attempt to portray a gay party that consists primarily of witty insults among the guests. The odd bits of drag and performance art were just annoying filler.Sigh.I will say that the connection between Hayes' and Rowe's characters does work and the scene where they are in bed together is played very well. (For those who haven't seen the movie, don't get too excited about the idea that there is a bed scene between them -- it's a good scene, but not what you're thinking.)But, as at least one other reviewer has pointed out, the way that their relationship is left -- specifically the way Rowe's character behaves in his last scene, simply doesn't fit with how he's behaved (or what we've been told) before. Overall, I didn't find that this movie warranted spending the 90-some minutes I spent on it and I really couldn't recommend it to anyone. On a larger note, this film made me think a little about why so much gay cinema is unsatisfying. I suspect that one of the problems is that so much of it is based on material prepared by younger first-time writers\/first-time directors, who often seem to be exploiting gay life as a way to get a first movie made or seen, but who then go off to do more mainstream projects afterward. What is missing are mature writers and directors (and I realize that mature in Hollywood means, at most, 35 but even that would be an improvement) making films about gay life when it has moved beyond the issues that pertain either to the coming-out\/lost loves of early adolescence period or to the lives of gay men during the screw-around and party and try to get a boyfriend stage.

Frankly, I was irritated by this movie from the opening narration, full of the sort of sad melancholic gay me, outcast as a child with Mom my only friend, unable to really connect as an adult which has made my life sort of sad, but I try to joke my way through the pain narration that should have dropped out of gay art years ago, along with pink feather boas and bad Judy Garland impersonations.There's nothing HORRIFIC about this movie -- it just plods along its relatively predictable path, occasionally stopping to underscore silly or offensive clichés like the gay man with the fag had best friend, or the older gay gentlemen and his loud and crass sexual double-entendres or the standard attempt to portray a gay party that consists primarily of witty insults among the guests. The odd bits of drag and performance art were just annoying filler.Sigh.I will say that the connection between Hayes' and Rowe's characters does work and the scene where they are in bed together is played very well. (For those who haven't seen the movie, don't get too excited about the idea that there is a bed scene between them -- it's a good scene, but not what you're thinking.)But, as at least one other reviewer has pointed out, the way that their relationship is left -- specifically the way Rowe's character behaves in his last scene, simply doesn't fit with how he's behaved (or what we've been told) before. Overall, I didn't find that this movie warranted spending the 90-some minutes I spent on it and I really couldn't recommend it to anyone. On a larger note, this film made me think a little about why so much gay cinema is unsatisfying. I suspect that one of the problems is that so much of it is based on material prepared by younger first-time writers\/first-time directors, who often seem to be exploiting gay life as a way to get a first movie made or seen, but who then go off to do more mainstream projects afterward. What is missing are mature writers and directors (and I realize that mature in Hollywood means, at most, 35 but even that would be an improvement) making films about gay life when it has moved beyond the issues that pertain either to the coming-out\/lost loves of early adolescence period or to the lives of gay men during the screw-around and party and try to get a boyfriend stage.

Roy Schneider gives another great performance as Brody, the Amity Island Chief of Police, and a lot of the same tension is there in the atmosphere and tone of the movie, but the script could have been written by a junior high school kid and the shark has turned from a vicious but natural predator and into a movie monster.The massive lapses of basic logic are encompassed mostly by things like the way Brody is shunned by everyone on the island, even the Mayor, who is anxiously trying to attract investors and tourists to his island. The last thing he needs is someone running around yelling about a shark, he has to get the island back on its feet after those last shark attacks&#133; I really hope that this is meant to be a brilliant display of magnificent greed, because otherwise it is nothing less than jaw-dropping stupidity. This guy is trying to save the island from all the trouble that it went through after the last shark attacks, and so not only does he ignore a sudden proliferation of missing and dead teenagers, but he and his whole panel of advisors see a picture of what is unmistakably a shark's eye and claim to see nothing. Wow.That picture of the shark was probably the best part of the movie, particularly the scene where Brody is in the darkroom watching it get developed. The circumstances under which the picture was taken make for an excellent scene, probably the best in the film, but one that is quickly ruined when we have to sit and watch a whole panel decide that it's safer to assume that it's a picture of nothing. After all, they could get SUED. Needless to say, there is no mention of what to do when a lot of people turn up dead from shark attacks and it is revealed to the public that these people not only promptly ignored photographic evidence, but fired the man that brought it to their attention. 'Sued' does not even begin to cover it.When two kids turn up missing early in the movie, one of the island's three police officers is assigned to drag the bottom of the water, an assignment to which he complains, 'For how long? It's gonna be dark soon!' The only thing he didn't say was Wah! Wah! Wah! And not only that, but when they succeed in accidentally pulling up the power line to the island, he says, 'Let's get out of here before we DO find something!' That's some excellent police work there, little buddy.The movie is able to exist because of the difficulties that Brody has in convincing anyone that there really is a shark out there. This is what allows for the creation of much of the tension in the movie, but it is also the source of a lot of the stupidity in it. When a bunch of tourists or investors or something is being taken for a tour, the mayor looks up and is dismayed to see Brody up in a lookout tower watching the water. He tries desperately to distract anyone from seeing him, apparently unaware that anyone with a thought in their head would see a guy in a tower watching the water, and immediately identify him as a lifeguard and not give him another thought. Not in this movie. When asked if anyone had any questions, it's not hard to predict what some lunkhead is going to wonder about. Not tourist traffic, not real estate costs, not the costs of managing resorts or anything rational like that. They want to know why there's a guy in a tower watching the water. Please.By the way, why does no one notice the fin in this movie? Every time the fin pops out of the water, everyone is looking the other way, even just after an attack, when it would seem that everyone would be watching the water frantically. When a group of divers has a run in with the shark, they ascend in a panic, and because they came up too fast, the air in their lungs and blood expands and one of them finds himself with perforated lungs and an embolism.

He had badly written lines, as did everyone else, and then he had these ridiculous bouts of idiocy written into his character. When he finds the tiny sailboat with his son and a couple friends on it floating out in the water, he hugs his son and then tells him to get to shore. Any real father, or policeman, would have grabbed him and yanked him onto his boat rather than leave him out floating around where he found him. Then when he's trying to rescue the kids off the wrecked boats near the end of the film, he gets spooked when the shark shows up and, despite being the CHIEF OF POLICE, succeeds in crashing his boat into the rocks and stranding all of them.

It had a crisp semi-humorous story coupled with two actresses that were very into their roles. There were some dark elements that I was not expecting when they were dealing with the gangsters that kept my attention until the very end. This was one of those films where you knew exactly how it was going to end, but you still had fun watching your characters get there. This film was a no-brainer, but in a good sense. If you are looking for a fun, caper film that takes no energy to watch than this is the film for you. That is exactly what I was looking for when I watched this film, and it worked perfectly. Let me tell you why.My biggest satisfaction from this film came from the very unrealistic portrayal of London's dark underbelly. It begins with a very sinister retrospect on the crime in this populated city with images of hardcore robbers doing what they do best. That is the last glimpse we have of that world because by the end of the film the darkness sheds to light and we are handed a fantasy world all our own. The bad guys go from their darkened world and into mansions full of color, ambition, and cartoon blunders. It is this sense of unreality that kept me focused on this film. Here we have two women that are having this 'movie' adventure while hiding in bushes, wearing dark sunglasses, and fighting with guys in the cow pastures, yet on the other hand we have these criminals that truly want to kill them. There are huge guns fired, people get shot, and there are even some literal explosions. It reminded me of when Elmer Fudd was hunting for Bugs Bunny. There is some horror to the realization that Fudd only wants to 'kill the rabbit', but there is humor in the unrealistic events that occur due to Bugs' outlandish style and Fudd's ignorance. So, when you look at the cover of this film, do not be fooled. What I am trying to say here is that the unreal story is what kept my attention. I don't know if the writers wanted to create a real world with these heroes, but in my eyes they didn't. This was a fictional story, and I couldn't see this happening in real life &#133; and that worked for me.I must say that Minnie Driver and Mary McCormack are not at the top of Hollywood players list, but they seemed to carry themselves well in this picture. I think the reason that they worked was because it was a small film. Driver and McCormack do better in these small budgeted films than they do in the blockbusters. I don't think I have ever seen a big-budget Minnie Driver film that I would say was 'amazing', and the same goes for McCormack. High Heels and Low Lifes is their type of film. Thankfully, director Mel Smith knows that and knew what he had to work with. He keeps the tone low on this film, making the humor not laugh-out-loud, but grinable. There wasn't really anything spectacular about the direction of this film, and that was perfect for this film. At times directors of these smaller films try to reach out and become to artsy with their craft, this was not the case here. Smith stayed on the path of this film and worked his magic with the greatest of ease. He was not trying to go over the top, but yet successfully kept this film from sinking.Overall, this was a 'cute' film. I will use that word again because I cannot think of a better way to describe this simple film. It was easy on the eyes and on the mind, and if you are in the mood for that style of film than High Heel and Low Lifes will provide it. Minnie Driver and Mary McCormack play off each other exceptionally well while Mel Smith eases behind the camera. There is nothing spectacular about this film. I probably will never see it again, but it was worth watching once. It is always good to have these types of films around.

While it did follow a very formulaic caper approach, there were elements that were very original and stood out in this film. It had a crisp semi-humorous story coupled with two actresses that were very into their roles. There were some dark elements that I was not expecting when they were dealing with the gangsters that kept my attention until the very end. This was one of those films where you knew exactly how it was going to end, but you still had fun watching your characters get there. This film was a no-brainer, but in a good sense. If you are looking for a fun, caper film that takes no energy to watch than this is the film for you. That is exactly what I was looking for when I watched this film, and it worked perfectly. Let me tell you why.My biggest satisfaction from this film came from the very unrealistic portrayal of London's dark underbelly. It begins with a very sinister retrospect on the crime in this populated city with images of hardcore robbers doing what they do best. That is the last glimpse we have of that world because by the end of the film the darkness sheds to light and we are handed a fantasy world all our own. The bad guys go from their darkened world and into mansions full of color, ambition, and cartoon blunders. It is this sense of unreality that kept me focused on this film. Here we have two women that are having this 'movie' adventure while hiding in bushes, wearing dark sunglasses, and fighting with guys in the cow pastures, yet on the other hand we have these criminals that truly want to kill them. There are huge guns fired, people get shot, and there are even some literal explosions. It reminded me of when Elmer Fudd was hunting for Bugs Bunny. There is some horror to the realization that Fudd only wants to 'kill the rabbit', but there is humor in the unrealistic events that occur due to Bugs' outlandish style and Fudd's ignorance. So, when you look at the cover of this film, do not be fooled. What I am trying to say here is that the unreal story is what kept my attention. I don't know if the writers wanted to create a real world with these heroes, but in my eyes they didn't. This was a fictional story, and I couldn't see this happening in real life &#133; and that worked for me.I must say that Minnie Driver and Mary McCormack are not at the top of Hollywood players list, but they seemed to carry themselves well in this picture. I think the reason that they worked was because it was a small film. Driver and McCormack do better in these small budgeted films than they do in the blockbusters. I don't think I have ever seen a big-budget Minnie Driver film that I would say was 'amazing', and the same goes for McCormack. High Heels and Low Lifes is their type of film. Thankfully, director Mel Smith knows that and knew what he had to work with. He keeps the tone low on this film, making the humor not laugh-out-loud, but grinable. There wasn't really anything spectacular about the direction of this film, and that was perfect for this film.

I've just viewed the new Warner Brother's Classic DVD of this great film with commentary by Eric Lax and I have some commentary of my own.Firstly, I saw the still of Anne Sheridan posing with the crew in Mexico among the 'extras' but I have run the scene where she supposedly plays the prostitute back and forth and even considering Hollywood's make-up know-how, the black wig, etc., there is no way at all that is her. I looked at it with a picture of Ann Sheridan next to the screen and the eyes and jaw-line are totally different than that. My theory is that Sheridan did go to Mexico and did film such a scene but Huston or Warners decided not to use it for some reason and it was reshot but the story that that is Anne Sheridan remained alive.Mr. Lax identified the guy in the bar who warns Dobbs and Curtain about McCormick as Tim Holt's father Jack and goes on to tell the story of his life and career but in fact that actor, as the IMDb shows is Pat Flaherty. Jack Holt is the guy in the flophouse that Howard is talking to when we first encounter him. Lax has a tendency to discuss the biographies and resumes of people involved with the film ad nauseum instead of discussing what we are seeing on screen, which is what commentaries are all about. At one point he describes the history of the Warner Brothers and how they got into the movie business.One thing he could have spent more time on is Humphrey Bogart's hairpieces. In the barber shop scene, we see Dobbs setting all slicked up- and slicked down. He actually looks awful in this scene, like a 70 year old trying to make himself look half his age, (he is of course looking for female companionship but the prospects appear dimmer than he imagines unless money is involved). Later, when Dobbs is going nuts, he sports a wonderful thatch of thick curly hair. Even though his character is dirty and exhausted Bogart somehow looks a generation younger than he does in the barbershop scene. He looks downright handsome and a little wild. Lax continually describes Bogart's character as 'loathsome' and compares him to the gangsters he played early in his career. I disagree. What this really is is the greatest departure from the 'star' system by a male actor in the history of the Golden Age of Hollywood. All the characters they played were either virtuous, with their virtue somehow granting them great mental and martial abilities, or tragically flawed but powerful, with a great 'Is this the End for Rico?' or 'Top of the World Ma!' ending. Here we see that Dobbs, even at the beginning is a rather pathetic man who has been beaten down by life. He still has a few shreds of common decency left, enough to forge a tenuous friendship with Curtin and a partnership with Howard. The thought that his ship has finally come in through the acquisition of gold becomes his undoing. He expects life to take it away from him and figures, wrongly, that his partners are the biggest threat to his salvation. His growing paranoia separates him from them and leaves him vulnerable to the bandits who fulfill his expectation of doom. He does a despicable thing but is a pathetic, almost sympathetic character who is in no way similar to the gangsters Bogie played in the previous decade. Look at the careers of Gable, Tracy, Cooper, Cagney, Fonda, Stewart or any of the others and you'll not find a single Fred C. Dobbs.

Time Bandits, on the other hand, sets its sights high andmanages a bullseye. Is it perfect? Not at all; Gilliam, I think, isincapable of perfection. But, unlike some of his other films - Fearand Loathing and Fisher King come to mind - Time Bandits' faultsadd to its glory rather than detract from it. The faults of TimeBandits give the movie character; they are not distracting.For me, this film represents Gilliam's most perfect integration ofsatire, fantasy, and adventure. The satire may not be as keen as inBrazil, but it's still on point, skewering consumer culture in asinventive and funny a way as Romero did in Dawn of the Dead. Thefantasy elements too - the Time of Legends and the Fortress ofUltimate Darkness - are truly amazing, prefiguring and,occasionally, one-upping the similar elements in Munchausenand Brazil. Furthermore, the adventure, which seemed incongruous in Brazil, is rollicking here, pacing the movie in a waythat prevents boredom. Time Bandits also supplies hefty doses of humor (both light-hearted and gallows) and terror. Like all great children's films(Wonka and the Wizard of Oz for instance), Time Bandits terrifies(my reaction to the film as a five year old, I think, is not atypical).The ending is nothing if not upsetting and the remainder of the filmhas moments that induce abject horror (Evil's minions still give methe creeps). Lastly, Time Bandits has my favorite Gilliam moment and,perhaps, one of my favorite moments in cinema history -Agamemnon vs. Minotaur. The battle is absolutely brilliant and theMinotaur (this may be an incorrect term but, I think, accuratelyconveys a sense of the creature\/man Agamemnon faces) looksimpeccable.

","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy"},{"date":"10 November 2004","score":"3 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" I saw Time Bandits first at the age of four. My parents and I werevisiting their friends on Saturday night as we, and some othercouples, frequently did. The adults stayed in the dining room,discussing adult things and looking at antiques. The children(there were usually five of us all between the ages of five andtwelve) were relegated to the den where we would watch television- usually The Facts of Life or Animal Bloopers. Well, one fatefulweekend in 1985 or 1986, we watched Time Bandits on HBO. It isan experience that has stayed with me - particularly the ending ofthe film. I remember being absolutely distraught at the finale. Infact, Time Bandits upset me so much that, until a year or two ago, Irefused to watch it again.Mind you, I adore Monty Python (though not as much as certainpeople I went to college with; they started the Monty Python Hordeand re-enacted scenes from Flying Circus episodes). I still findHoly Grail and the Life of Brian (especially Brian) to be two of thefunniest movies I have ever seen. They made me guffaw when Iwas ten and they continue to do so today. My penchant for Python,then, should have led me to the work of Gilliam sans the rest. Itdid. Except, as I said, I refused to watch Time Bandits.Well, that was a regrettable decision, as Time Bandits is, to mymind, his greatest achievement (cue the boos from Brazil fans).While Brazil represents a far more ambitious and high-mindedfilm (not to diminish Bandit's thematic concerns and ambition), itnevertheless fails to fulfill my expectations; in other words, I find itan incomplete and disappointing film. Do not misunderstand - Ienjoy Brazil, think that it has brilliant moments. I just think thatultimately it falls short of its target. Time Bandits, on the other hand, sets its sights high andmanages a bullseye. Is it perfect? Not at all; Gilliam, I think, isincapable of perfection. But, unlike some of his other films - Fearand Loathing and Fisher King come to mind - Time Bandits' faultsadd to its glory rather than detract from it. The faults of TimeBandits give the movie character; they are not distracting.For me, this film represents Gilliam's most perfect integration ofsatire, fantasy, and adventure. The satire may not be as keen as inBrazil, but it's still on point, skewering consumer culture in asinventive and funny a way as Romero did in Dawn of the Dead. Thefantasy elements too - the Time of Legends and the Fortress ofUltimate Darkness - are truly amazing, prefiguring and,occasionally, one-upping the similar elements in Munchausenand Brazil. Furthermore, the adventure, which seemed incongruous in Brazil, is rollicking here, pacing the movie in a waythat prevents boredom. Time Bandits also supplies hefty doses of humor (both light-hearted and gallows) and terror. Like all great children's films(Wonka and the Wizard of Oz for instance), Time Bandits terrifies(my reaction to the film as a five year old, I think, is not atypical).The ending is nothing if not upsetting and the remainder of the filmhas moments that induce abject horror (Evil's minions still give methe creeps). Lastly, Time Bandits has my favorite Gilliam moment and,perhaps, one of my favorite moments in cinema history -Agamemnon vs. Minotaur. The battle is absolutely brilliant and theMinotaur (this may be an incorrect term but, I think, accuratelyconveys a sense of the creature\/man Agamemnon faces) looksimpeccable. I cannot relate in words how exhilarating I found thatscene both as a child and now as an adult (Gilliam, it seems, hasa way with one-on-one combat scenes. Both this scene and theBlack Knight scene in Grail are stupendous). All in all, Time Bandits is an incredibly interesting and excitingmovie. If you are not familiar with the work of Terry Gilliam it iscertainly the best place to start and, for me, it's the man's bestwork.

Don't get me wrong - of course I saw the seminal serial-killer flick when it originally came out in '95, albeit when it first hit videostores. At that time, for some reason unknown to me today, I simply didn't care for it. It didn't hook my attention, and something about the directorial style jarred me rather than impressed. Well that all changed - dramatically - last night when I sat home alone and watched it very carefully on DVD. Some of you already know that David Fincher is one of my very favorite directors, mainly because of FIGHT CLUB, but also for his other mindtrick movies such as THE GAME, and even ALIENS III to an extent - a movie I feel deserves more appeal than it seems to receive. PANIC ROOM was a bit of a disappointment to me arriving on the heels of the senses-shattering Fight Club, but there was no mistaking the genius that went into its craftmanship. Now back to Se7en, and its stunning, brutal beauty. There is no room in my mind left for doubt that Jonathan Doe wins the blue ribbon prize for most brilliant serial killer ever captured in a movie, and the now familiar actor who portrays him delivers what I feel must remain as his most chilling screen role to date. Whatever it was I didn't get about Se7en nine years ago, I can only try and imagine; but I needn't bother now that I've fully digested this tightly focused morality tale about the sins of modern man which we all take for granted throughout our daily lives. Morgan Freeman delivers such a solid and outstanding performance as Detective William Somerset, that he helps rise this film above the normal gamut of such typical police procedural fare, and into the realm of art. His character provides the much needed humanity that is the focus of the movie's themes. Brad Pitt portrays the cocky Detective Mills in his usual easy going, fluent style that makes him such a box office success. The movie is an outstanding depiction of all the baroque details that make up a squalid life in a rundown section of New York city, itself symbolic as the diseased heart of a country passing into sociological ruin and decay. To not recognize Se7en as a true masterpiece of film-making is to have committed one of the deadly sins of movie-going not paying enough attention. Because that is what I was guilty of - not once, but twice did I see this movie on video during the past decade, and I was obviously not engaged to the point of committing myself to the inherent dynamics going on in the film. All I can say today after having this stark and disturbing psychological thriller drilled into my mind for the third time, is that I have learned what not paying close attention to the works of David Fincher can result in simply missing out on what could be considered one of the most talented and brilliant film auters of our generation. They say hindsight is 20-20, and in this case that certainly turned out to be true, as I now consider Se7en to rival Fight Club as contendor for not only Fincher's best movie thus far, but most certainly exceeding Silence Of The Lambs (in my mind) to claim the prize as the #1 Best serial-killer movie ever lensed. The movie is a triumph of thematic values that far exceeds the ambitions of Silence Of The Lambs. In Silence, there was not much beyond the tightly controlled unspooling of the plot, and of course there was the dynamic and chilling performance from Sir Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Lector his character was that film's dark heart. But to compare the two films beyond their serial killer cores would be a mistake; they are truly two different enterprises altogether. In Se7en, we have the decaying city itself as the heart of what is unfolding around all the characters; it is as if they all dwell within its sickened superstructure, in a sort of grim resolve to continue on until it reaches its final, shuddering spasm & ceases beating altogether. And within this structure haunted by ceaseless violence and hopelessness, humans dwell in their daily struggles to get on with their lives, or even try and devote their lives to doing something about it, as in the case of Pitt's detective Mills. Meanwhile, there are those who have already spent their lives in futility against the ever looming, oceanic tide of sin, filth, and murder that has been washing in daily since as long as they can remember, as in the case of Freeman's detective Somerset, who is intent on retiring so he can escape to the countryside and enjoy some peace, clear air, and tranquility. And caught in between these 2 polarities is the killer, John Doe, as expressionistic & sadistic a killer as we are ever likely to meet on screen, yet imbued with an underlying philosophical outlook that nearly demands the unsettled viewer's sympathetic understanding even in the face of his indisputably loathsome acts. The arc these 3 characters represent serves to ennervate the inner wire of that naked 40-watt bulb which weakly flickers on to reveal what is lying in wait inside the darkness enveloping the cellar under everyone's prettied-up homes that we are grouped together in a darkening basement under the sky, subject to the mass-induced and traumatizing influence of apathy, greed and sloth engendered by the mob mentality of society itself. In Se7en's unrelentingly grim vision, no one escapes this evergrowing cancerous shadow on the face of humanity; not the serial killer John Doe, who despite all his efforts to prove something to his fellows by his heinous deeds is doomed to be swallowed up by history as merely one of it's slightly darker footnotes; certainly not detective Mills who is ultimately victimized where it matters most, beyond hope and redemption; and in the final analysis, not even the well-meaning and morally focused detective Somerset, who in the end must face the traumatizing truth that no matter where he may choose to escape from the city and end out his days, he will never be able to escape the memories that made up his bruised and shattered life. Se7en is, in short, a triumph of artistic film-making on every level, and in this moviegoer's eyes, deserves as many stars as your rating system offers. A true classic in the psychological thriller genre. ","genre":null},{"date":"10 November 2004","score":"","review":" Well I finally saw Se7en for the first real time last night.

What makes this film unique compared to the the other films is the originality and surprise this film had to offer in the way of storyline compared with the other movies. What I mean by surprise is how this film explained Freddy Kruegers origins before he died. This included his family, upbringing and why he became evil. This is something that wasn't fully explained in the other sequels. The fact that Freddy had a daughter and why he was a child murderer was never mentioned\/ explained in any of the previous Freddy films, until they explained it all in this sequel. Most 'Elm Street' viewers have probably assumed that he was evil, solely because of his knowledge and\/or paternal genetics, on how he was conceived when his mother (Sister Mary Helena) was raped by 100 maniacs. Yes, this was the root of why he was evil, but the reason why he killed children is because he was brutally bullied as a child by his classmates for being different from the other children and for being conceived in such a horrible way. I also thought this films plot was quite good, on how Freddy possessed Alices'unborn baby Jacob, as Whit Hertford (six year old Jacob) did a fantastic acting performance playing a Freddy possessed child, for he was so evil and remorse, the way Freddy possessed him. What also makes this film different is the extra sense of grimness\/humour and fantastic special effects (combined in one) compared to the other films.(Special Effects\/ie.The way Freddys daughter killed him in the end etc..) As each 'Elm Street' sequel is filmed, Freddy Kreuger becomes more and more funny as the story goes on! The way Freddy killed Dan on his motorcycle, by taking full control over his bike and by turning Dan into a metal-faced freak with Freddys face on his speedometer yelling 'This boy feels the need for speed and \/Power Drive - Fast lane' I found absolutely hilarious.One scene I that didn't make sense was how Freddy was born a freakish monster. I don't understand that scene because Freddy was a normal looking man before he died with a job, wife and daughter, as portrayed in the film.

Sure, everyone knew it would make a fortune, and the merchandising was there like it is now, but the characters were handled in a manner that didn't betray their comics heritage.Marlon Brando is fine for a role that he clearly took for the money. He is Brando, and just his presence and reading give a certain nobility to his character of Jor-El. Although not the first woman you'd consider as Lois Lane, Margot Kidder makes the role her own with her combination of 70s break out feminism and damsel in distress reactions. Gene Hackman, fresh from some of the best work in American cinema (The French Connection films and The Conversation, and even the Poseidon Adventure) is a hammy but sociopathic Lex Luther.But mostly, there is Christopher Reeve as Clark Kent\/Superman. An unknown who physically matches the comic appearance, he brings a nice everyman bumble to Clark and a hero in training to Superman. Nice performance that he will always be remembered for.This movie is long but well-paced, and chronologically follows little Kal-El\/Superman from Krypton's destruction through his maturation into the Man of Steel. The scene showing young Clark preparing to leave his adoptive mother in America's heartland is breathtaking.John Williams' score merely set the bar for music in movies. It's exhilarating.Whether you see Superman as an immigrant in the new country, as so many were when he was first spawned, or in a religious light, sent from the stars by his father to help humanity, you have to admit, they don't make many like Superman.

This usually signifies that the film will try to follow the story of the book faithfully, perhaps changing a few minor elements to make the transition to film easier to follow, but in general, staying true to the gist of the book. However, none of this at all applies to 'Bram Stoker's Dracula', which takes the title, characters and very basic plot elements from the novel, but not much else.Director Francis Ford Coppola feels obliged to add a love plot between the title character and Mina Murray, who in the novel, he merely attempted to transform into a vampire alongside himself. Presumably, the idea was to give Dracula more to do, so the vampire isn't reduced to a supporting character, but the love plot doesn't work at all, and it is handled extremely awkwardly, making it completely uncredible as well as unlikely. (what could Mina possibly find appealing in a vampire trying to drain her blood to prolong his own miserable life even more?!) And why the decision for Dracula's vampire brides to be naked? They were far too creepy to seem appealing to the audience, and their entire scene seemed really out of place, and just badly done in general.Many original elements from the book were absurdly overdone, such as Dracula turning into a beast,.(there was no need for him to transform as frequently as he did) Also, Dracula's moving shadow on the wall and the instantly changing hair colour of the supporting characters were laughable at best. It's true that the story focuses almost entirely on the four main characters, which is lucky, since it is impossible to sympathize in any way with the supporting characters such as Lord Holmwood and Quincey Morris, since their parts were so one dimensional and underdeveloped.However, Coppola's biggest mistake was trying to make the audience sympathize with Dracula, with him wanting forgiveness from God after swearing vengeance on him thousands of years ago. Dracula is supposed to be the quintessential monster, we are supposed to hate him, and glorify in his death, not feel sorry for him. Trying to fit both elements into the same character just failed miserably.The costumes in many cases were really quite ridiculous - when Dracula is first introduced as an old man, he is wearing a ludicrous red gown of some sort, and has his hair pulled into grotesque granny buns. How are we supposed to be intimidated by that? Later on, we find the dastardly vampire sporting John Lennon sunglasses, and a typical Johnny Depp hat. So now the vampire is going out of his way to start new fashion trends?! More unintentional laughs are now provoked.Coppola did manage to secure a couple of good casting jobs, but the casting of Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker has to be one of the most noticeable miscastings in film history, as Reeves gives one of his most wooden performances ever here, also showing that he cannot fake an accent to save his life, and has the entirely wrong look for the period. Reeves drags down the movie more than any of Coppola's directorial misfires could. Fortunately, Gary Oldman is excellent, engaging and charismatic as Dracula, if not quite as villainous as one would have hoped. Winona Ryder is another who at first glance appears to be miscast, but she actually turns out a decent performance, particularly in her scenes with Van Helsing. This is of course aided by the excellent casting of Anthony Hopkins, who is very suited to the role, although he played it much colder than the character in the novel, who was considerably more warm. Hopkins' Van Helsing is a no-nonsense, no time to waste, places to go, vampires to kill kind of guy. Tom Waits also stands out as raving lunatic Renfield, one of his strongest acting performances to date.It is an insult to Bram Stoker's novel just by naming the movie after it, as it would be even if Coppola's adaptation had been done well.

Christopher Plummer, with his mushy red nose and schoolteacher's diction, overdoes it a bit, perhaps, but it basically goes with the character he's been given. And David Strathairn's Joe St. George surely deserves a high place in the canon of Stephen King movie villains. Strathairn makes him as bad as can be, and yet there's occasionally a playful touch that *almost* makes us see why Dolores married him in the first place.In the end, a rather underrated film, successful on many levels. 8.5. out of 10.

It has some good moments in it that make you laugh, cry, etc... but after a while, you forget what you are watching and what the plot of the movie is suppose to be. It's like a serial novel or a long miniseries. I don't like Sarandon's character. I think she portrays a mom horribly in this movie. Roberts is okay, but you can't help wondering why she would want to be with Ed Harris who looks like he could be her dad. Gross. The only redeeming quality to the whole movie is Jena Malone who is a superb actress no matter what crap of a script she is given to work with. I think this movie put her on the map of faces to watch for. If you are looking for a good movie, look for one with Jena in it. Ugh. I got to watch this movie twice in succession on TBS while typing a paper and it didn't get better the second time. I would only recommend viewing this during an ice storm or when there is nothing better to do outside or you don't have a good book to read. But really, its not worth the time Mr. Columbus put into it.
