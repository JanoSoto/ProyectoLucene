Of course, it is great in technical point of view, the shot of the eye dilating is cool, all the visual effects are cool, and technically astonishing. But, it is just that, it is just cool. They do not mean anything, they are put there just to decorate the story, they are useless. And there is too many of them. I went to see a movie, not a parade of technical skills. A movie, not a video clip. What could have been an interesting aspect of the movie becomes boring and excessive.It is the same thing with the story, which I find extremely moralistic. Of course, drugs are bad, of course they can kill you, I don't need to pay ten dollars and suffer during two hours to understand it. My parents told me that many times before. Besides, the way Aronofsky uses to affect his audience is easy, sadly easy. He wants to shock you, and in the hardest way. And he goes for the easy way. It is easy to make you cry and to make you hate a character showing him kick a dog to death. In the same way, he shows you a rotting arm, gore sex and all the disgraces that can happen to a poor junkie or to his mother addicted to pills and TV. He never tries to say things in a subtle way, he things people who see his movie are idiots who can not understand anything unless he shows it, completely. He made a movie for idiots, I must repeat it.He does too much and is redundant in his message and in the way he tells it. I could elaborate, give more arguments and examples, but this movie really do not deserve more of my time. I have wasted enough seeing it. If Requiem for a Dream is worth something, it is just because of the images effects, because its subject, drugs, is the same a teenager would choose  and what he says about it is not much more mature. Drugs are not so interesting and this movie does not tell me anything I did not know before about them.

It is obvious they had to die, what would they have done with all that money in Florida? The whole movie's idea would loose its strength if these two wanderers ended living a normal kind of life amongst wealthy people. They would have been corrupted. It would have been like seeing Dean Moriarty sane, sober, with a pretty family and working in an office, living in a tiny house in suburbia. Awful.The easy answer is that they were going against society's laws and values, this biggest and more powerful monster had to eliminate them. But, no, that is not the answer. That simplistic answer limits the movie to a polarized vision of the world where liberty fights against repression, good against evil. What could be more typical?No. This movie goes beyond this eternal dialectic. No. What happens is that these two wanderers do not embody only liberty, they are not just rebels, they are not only the good guys. In fact, they won their money from drug dealing, what is somewhat reprehensible, morally speaking. But that is just another reason for their death.What happened is that they screwed up, as Fonda said during their last night. They did not understand the hippies, the people they looked like, physically, at least, and they felt relieved when they left this community of peace and love. They didn't even share with the hippies the acid as the guy who offered it to them made it understand, in a subtle way.But their main sin was to pervert Nicholson, to have initiated him into the world of drugs and of the road in order for him to only find death in the kicks of the repressive men of the South.They went to Mardi Gras to get in a whore house. After a while, they got out and the entered the graveyard where the ate the acid which made them cry as the prostitute yelled I'm dying, I'm dying. Maybe another death they caused, symbolically.They where just two guys, absolutely unable to adapt themselves into anything, who left behind them nothing but death. It seems as they did not mean to, but that is even worse. That is why society killed them. Well, yes, there may be a little of the liberty repression thing but I prefer my way to interpret it.

When I first heard there were plans for a movie, I knew it was going to be amazing. Well, I'm amazed at the fact that I was wrong.I don't know what in particular screwed this up so badly. I just can't put my finger on it. Maybe it's the fact that I expected this movie to truly amaze me, and my expectations were a little to high.Five years ago, this movie would've amazed me. That is, it would've amazed me because I didn't recognize bad movies. Five years ago I didn't realize how truly bad Batman & Robin was. I guess this movie was made for kids, but they should've thought about the teens and adults who grew up with Spidey and thought that maybe he grew up too.How could it have been better? Here are just a few suggestions1) Don't change the bloody costumes or powers- the Green Goblin was NOT supposed to make me laugh, but it did. And what was the point of making web-shooting an integrated power instead of an invention?? If it came with the powers, realistically, it would come out of Peter's arse.2) Make the movie darker. It's too happy; Spider-Man is supposed to be a little darker inside. There was way too little thought about Uncle Ben's famous words With great power comes great responsibility. Spidey is supposed to be dwelling on this philosophy waaay more.3) It's a simple boy-meets-girl-and-falls-in-love-then-gets-superpowers plot, which even in the comics demonstrated little depth. I just thought maybe they could explore his uniquely teen mentality more, get into Peter's psychology. After all, his mind, flaws and truely human frailty is what attracted most of his fans.Overall, the film just didn't go deep enough. But this is coming from a person who expects movies of this caliber to be really, really good. Overall, this is an okay movie to watch with pizza and some friends, and that's about it. I must admit, it's interesting to finally see Spidey in live action, and it'll be interesting to see Doc Oc and the Lizard on film (and possible Venom or Carnage in the third movie, which I'm sure they'll make). I give Spider-Man a 6 or 7 out of 10.Hopefully they'll remake the Spidey movie in 20 years...I'll make it a personal goal to live to see a Spider-Man movie adaptation I truly love.

This puts people in the seats, and that's all nice and good. The irony is that a small name, Jim Caviezel, grabs the emotion and becomes the core of the movie.The movie is a bit misguided.  A lot of scenes are slopped together, and although it reflects war it's not good cinema.  What makes a movie good is the ability to sweep up the audience and control their feelings.  Once the audience is confused it's very hard to get this to happen.  I think that, in literary form, you can catch the view of many easily.  In a movie, it becomes jumbled and too much for viewers.  The battles in the movie were good, but the plot seemed to try too hard to pluck our sensitive cords.Caviezel carries this movie.  As Witt, he shows us a man who only wants beauty and peace in his life.  Unfortunately, a war becomes the only way to attain this.  I feel for him every time he escapes to his Utopian dream, and allow myself to be swept up in that dream with him.  If you do this you can understand how terrible this war was for Witt.Witt's last scene in the movie is so beautiful I couldn't speak for a long time.  Watch as Caviezel's face turns and gathers what he's been dealt, the realization.  It's there.  And then, just through watching his eyes, you know what will happen.  I actually thought it would've been perfect if they cut it there and had him swimming or something, with that captivating soundtrack going in the background.  Unfortunately, they added a little more, and I don't think they should've.The bottom line is, watch the movie through Witt.  You will find a message, not to mention one of the greatest scenes in movie history.  And keep that soundtrack in your mind while watching.  It plays so sweetly.

Not at wether the film was good or bad, but how two direcors could have so much of a different approach to a series of books. I had at the time only seen 'The Silence of the Lambs' directed by Jonathan Demme a few years after this film. so I was expecting a high calibre film, and to say I was not dissapointed at all was no understatement.The movie is the story of police officer Will Graham's (the under rated William Petersen) near obseesive hunt for the serial killer, the 'Tooth Fairy' who already has murdered several family's before the film has begun. Now retired, Will is Enlisted by friend and FBI secretary Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina), Who coaxes his buddy to try and catch the killer. What we don't know before hand is that Wil has an unorthodox method of catching his target. He tries to put thoughts into his head like the murderer so he then knows how the man or woman thinks. This enable him to stay one step ahead of them. However While on a previous Job, the troubled former cop was attacked and left for dead by a killer he helped capture. This left more emotionally and mentally scarred by the ordeal than physically. It is this same killer, the psychiatrist Hannbal Lectre (Scots actor, Brian Cox) that he must consult to attempt and find his man and stop the killings.Michael does such a good job adapting the film to the screen (he also wrote the screenplay) that it's little wonder the film never became a box office hit. The cast lead by Petersen is first rate. Petersen is everyhing that a tortured film hero should be. Manly, but sensetive. Brave yet scared which Mann wisely convinces Petersen to do and bring out a great performance.Farina is good value too as is Kim Griest as Petersens devoted wife Molly. She is a complex woman who not only understands what her husband is trying to do but chides him for it. She wants him to stay with her and their son and not get involved in something that may seriously hurt him.Brian Cox in the more minor roll of Lecter has less to do as what Anthony Hopkins did in '...Silence'. Never the less his performance I think is classier than Hopkins more. It reeks of subtlety that was lacking in Hopkins performance in 1990. He was good but not as much as Cox.All in all Manhunter I thought was a must see film. Maybe it's slightly dated but what film to some degee does not. If you get a chance please try and watch it. It's one of the better film's of the late eighties.Robs Rating * * * * *       ","genre":null},{"date":"22 March 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  * Terrible * * Below Par * * * Not Bad * * * * Good * * * * * BrilliantI saw Michael Manns take on the Thomas Harris novel afew years ago when my parents had satelite t.v. and I was very surprised.

Now retired, Will is Enlisted by friend and FBI secretary Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina), Who coaxes his buddy to try and catch the killer. What we don't know before hand is that Wil has an unorthodox method of catching his target. He tries to put thoughts into his head like the murderer so he then knows how the man or woman thinks. This enable him to stay one step ahead of them. However While on a previous Job, the troubled former cop was attacked and left for dead by a killer he helped capture. This left more emotionally and mentally scarred by the ordeal than physically. It is this same killer, the psychiatrist Hannbal Lectre (Scots actor, Brian Cox) that he must consult to attempt and find his man and stop the killings.Michael does such a good job adapting the film to the screen (he also wrote the screenplay) that it's little wonder the film never became a box office hit. The cast lead by Petersen is first rate. Petersen is everyhing that a tortured film hero should be. Manly, but sensetive. Brave yet scared which Mann wisely convinces Petersen to do and bring out a great performance.Farina is good value too as is Kim Griest as Petersens devoted wife Molly. She is a complex woman who not only understands what her husband is trying to do but chides him for it. She wants him to stay with her and their son and not get involved in something that may seriously hurt him.Brian Cox in the more minor roll of Lecter has less to do as what Anthony Hopkins did in '...Silence'. Never the less his performance I think is classier than Hopkins more. It reeks of subtlety that was lacking in Hopkins performance in 1990. He was good but not as much as Cox.All in all Manhunter I thought was a must see film. Maybe it's slightly dated but what film to some degee does not. If you get a chance please try and watch it. It's one of the better film's of the late eighties.Robs Rating * * * * *       ","genre":"Crime, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"22 March 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  What started out as a simple mission to scout out the area where the war had supposedly ended, two American pilots find themselves engaged in gun fire and are soon shot down to the ground.  From then on there is a struggle between the military and the peacekeepers as to how to go about getting the pilots back.One theme, or central insight, that can be seen from this movie is how all branches of the United States military come together as a family when one of their own is in danger.  This makes the audience feel more involved as well because we feel we are riding along with the military.Gene Hackman acts as Admiral Leslie Reigart in the film.  As good of an actor as Hackman is, I felt that his role in the film was too constrained. For an Admiral, they did not give him much power or control.  Owen Wilson stars as Chris Burnett, one of the pilots that was shot down.  With only seeing Wilson in comedies, I felt that he did a great job in playing the role as a fighter pilot.One scene that supports the theme mentioned is when Christmas dinner is being held.  This scene gives us a family atmosphere among the military. Although it may seem boring, the soldiers are eating with their new family members, since they cannot be with their actual families.Another scene that I found touching was when the crew fear that both pilots are dead.  Nothing but silence fills the room.  All of a sudden, one of the soldiers punches a hole in the wall and screams that they did nothing to save them.  Afterwards, silence again fills the room as the rest of the crew, including Hackman, are overcome with the fear of death to their pilots.Although not nearly as elaborately done by far, one can liken the film to something like `Saving Private Ryan.'  They share the same principle of getting one of their own out of harms way.  `Saving Private Ryan' was more combative and more gruesome with the ground war scenes.  `Behind Enemy Lines' did everything by aerial assaults.Music helps set the mood and tempo of the movie.  I enjoyed some of the freeze framing aspects of the movie when the pilots are about to get hit by the gunfire.  Everything freezes before impact and you can hear the pilots breathing and see the fear in their eyes.They also did a good job with some different angles.  I like the aerial shot of the Americans and the Bosnians when they are engaged in battle. They also have a good tilted shot of Hackman with his ship and it's men behind him.  This supports the family theme as Hackman looks like the father, and the men look like his children.Overall I really enjoyed watching this film.  After watching it a second time, you come to realize it's just the same cat and mouse chase movie. Seeing the closeness of the military units gives the audience some peace of mind, however that they would do anything for one another.

For instance, Jesus rebukes a storm on the Sea of Gallalie (sp?).  Does it make sense to rebuke an unconsciouness object?   Of course, the source of that consciouness would still be from God. Thus, if matter itself does possess a form of consciousness, it may be possible in the future for mankind to so arrange matter and energy in a machine that the inherent consciousness of that matter becomes manifest.Moving on, the rest of this review consists of some things I found thought provoking in the movie that gave it such deep meaning, IMO. If you have not seen the movie, then please read no further until you do.*** Spoiler Alert ***1.  Once David has bonded to a person, he cannot become unbonded. This was designed into him, but mysteriously cannot be undone even by those who designed him. This suggests that he is truly not simply a machine but something more.

But to shoot my own theory to pieces, I do an awful lot of English proofreading - yet I liked it.I actually watched Real Women Have Curves a while ago (pretty good film - I gave it a six because it needed a few loose ends tied up) and liked it. It's a movie about a Mexican American girl who goes to high school in Beverly Hills. The film opens when her mother is asking her to stay home and cook breakfast for everybody - on her last day of high school. The film continues like this.. but in the end, she actually learns something. You see true character development.This week while I was home sick I watched Bend It Like Beckham. If you don't know it, it's about an Indian girl in England who is a talented football (soccer for the Americans) player, but her parents refuse to let her play. I could tell you a lot more, but I'll just make my point.I compared the two movies in my head what kind of vote would I give Bend It Like Beckham? Was it better than Real Women Have Curves or not? I finally concluded that Real Women Have Curves had more depth... Bend It Like Beckham was more cliche. But... no, I'm not done. I refuse to give Bend It Like Beckham a bad score - I actually watched it twice. So what's the difference?A film doesn't have to be a piece of literature or whatever just to be entertaining. I was entertained by both, even though Real Women Have Curves definitely affected me more. My point is that Hocus Pocus might not be a masterpiece - but it IS fun and entertaining. It may not have won awards.. but I think it's worth watching.Thanks for reading my rant.

","genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller"},{"date":"22 March 2003","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  STORY - OVERVIEW     In a world where advanced robots are a common convenience, David (Haley Joel Osment) is created to be the first robot boy to have the ability to love. Through David, A.I. explores the human identity, their self-proclaimed superiority over other beings, as well as the responsibility of humans to other beings. HUMAN IDENTITY     Humans treat robots as mindless machines. When Dr. Hobby (William Hurt) proposes to build David, he off-handedly compares his creating David to God's creating Adam, claiming it will be like when 'God created Adam to love him'. Hobby displays the arrogance of humanity through a willingness to irresponsibly manipulate 'lesser beings'.    As an unlicensed runaway, David is captured and taken to the Flesh Fair to be destroyed to the amusement of its spectators. When David takes his fateful place on stage, he pleads that he is 'just a boy'. Having never seen this before, the crowd goes silent. Then the crowd sides with David, saving him from death. David's plea touches the crowd, forcing them to change their idea of what it means to be considered human.ARE ROBOTS SELF AWARE?     Self-awareness defines humanity, but it is also a device that enables humans to see themselves as superior to other creatures. At the Flesh Fair, we start to realize that robots are self-aware. One robot asks another robot to shut off his 'pain circuits' so that his death will be painless. Later, Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), when captured by the police and facing death, tells David, I am. I was!? This parallels Descartes? I think, therefore I am, and demonstrates Joe's self-awareness.RESPONSIBILITY TO OTHERS     Love is a dynamic, interconnectedness of two beings, not just a static, one-sided emotion. The responsibility of love, likewise, falls on both sides. In David's case, love is not a freely made choice. Instead, David's fate is to be irreversibly imprinted with someone whom he must love.    Monica imprints David, but has to reject him because he doesn't fit in. Later, David decides that if he could become a real, live boy, it would enable Monica to love him. In an effort to realize his dream, David pleads to a statue for it to turn him into a real boy, a plea that spans 2000 years. David cannot simply decide that this desire for Monica's love is not worth his pain. David's single-minded goal of love was irreversibly programmed into him and he is at the mercy of his unchangeable feelings.DAVID'S PURPOSE     The ending reveals David's ultimate purpose he delivers information about what humans were like with the advanced race, helping to fulfill their goal of learning more about what humankind were like. By design, David fails to realize his contribution, being concerned only with Monica's love.FAULTS     When an advanced race of beings appears near the end, I first thought they were aliens from another planet. Through the DVD extras, I learned the 'aliens' are instead extremely advanced descendants of robots like David and Joe. To not make this story point clear was a major flub, as there is nothing to be gained by keeping the audience in the dark.    When Monica is reconstructed from her DNA, it is explained that she can only be reconstructed exactly one time. Unfortunately, the explanation is too abstract for us to understand what's going on.     The ending had several different interpretations, but only because it was unintentionally vague.

Panoramic cities and wide landscapes that were beautiful on DVD surely would have been spectacular and haunting on the big screen.

Near the end, when David and Monica are in her bedroom, there is a glint of sunlight that transforms the scene from looking at Monica to looking at David. While the effect is inspirational, it also feels played up. Overall, the lighting added to the story in a simple yet expressive way.CONCLUSIONS     The issues dealt with in A.I. are so broad in their scope that the story must necessarily fail to achieve any large measure of focus, even considering its near 2-1\/2 hour running time. The nicest part of the story is that it is told so that the audience gets to draw their own conclusions, as opposed to the popular practice of spoon-feeding answers at the end. With A.I., the viewer can draw different conclusions throughout the movie as we see how things progress.    A.I. ended up being more thought provoking than entertaining.

Through David, A.I. explores the human identity, their self-proclaimed superiority over other beings, as well as the responsibility of humans to other beings. HUMAN IDENTITY     Humans treat robots as mindless machines. When Dr. Hobby (William Hurt) proposes to build David, he off-handedly compares his creating David to God's creating Adam, claiming it will be like when 'God created Adam to love him'. Hobby displays the arrogance of humanity through a willingness to irresponsibly manipulate 'lesser beings'.    As an unlicensed runaway, David is captured and taken to the Flesh Fair to be destroyed to the amusement of its spectators. When David takes his fateful place on stage, he pleads that he is 'just a boy'. Having never seen this before, the crowd goes silent. Then the crowd sides with David, saving him from death. David's plea touches the crowd, forcing them to change their idea of what it means to be considered human.ARE ROBOTS SELF AWARE?     Self-awareness defines humanity, but it is also a device that enables humans to see themselves as superior to other creatures. At the Flesh Fair, we start to realize that robots are self-aware. One robot asks another robot to shut off his 'pain circuits' so that his death will be painless. Later, Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), when captured by the police and facing death, tells David, I am. I was!? This parallels Descartes? I think, therefore I am, and demonstrates Joe's self-awareness.RESPONSIBILITY TO OTHERS     Love is a dynamic, interconnectedness of two beings, not just a static, one-sided emotion. The responsibility of love, likewise, falls on both sides. In David's case, love is not a freely made choice. Instead, David's fate is to be irreversibly imprinted with someone whom he must love.    Monica imprints David, but has to reject him because he doesn't fit in. Later, David decides that if he could become a real, live boy, it would enable Monica to love him. In an effort to realize his dream, David pleads to a statue for it to turn him into a real boy, a plea that spans 2000 years. David cannot simply decide that this desire for Monica's love is not worth his pain. David's single-minded goal of love was irreversibly programmed into him and he is at the mercy of his unchangeable feelings.DAVID'S PURPOSE     The ending reveals David's ultimate purpose he delivers information about what humans were like with the advanced race, helping to fulfill their goal of learning more about what humankind were like. By design, David fails to realize his contribution, being concerned only with Monica's love.FAULTS     When an advanced race of beings appears near the end, I first thought they were aliens from another planet. Through the DVD extras, I learned the 'aliens' are instead extremely advanced descendants of robots like David and Joe. To not make this story point clear was a major flub, as there is nothing to be gained by keeping the audience in the dark.    When Monica is reconstructed from her DNA, it is explained that she can only be reconstructed exactly one time. Unfortunately, the explanation is too abstract for us to understand what's going on.     The ending had several different interpretations, but only because it was unintentionally vague.

The music and cinematography are outstanding and even the costumes are great. All in all, you can't find a fault with this film. All the elements work and it is just so satisfying.

It is pure entertainment and master film-making. Despite its length it maintains interest throughout and, by the end, you're wanting more.    POSSIBLE SPOILER! Marlon Brando (Don Corleone) deservedly won the Oscar, with his fine performance. However, because he is absent from a majority of the film, it is the superb support from Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall (who all got Oscar nominations) that really keeps the film at an A-class standard. END OF POSSIBLE SPOILER!     The direction of Francis Ford Coppola is practically without fault and so is his writing, also contributed by the author of the novel, Mario Puzo. This is the gangster film that has inspired so many others (including Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas and, on TV, The Sopranos). The music and cinematography are outstanding and even the costumes are great. All in all, you can't find a fault with this film. All the elements work and it is just so satisfying. People who think it's over-rated are just fools who couldn't recognize great filmmaking if it hit them in the face.    It is hard, however, to judge whether part II is better or not, but one thing for sure is that it's as good as part I and better than part III. If you haven't seen this film then I suggest you rent it or buy it immediately because you really don't know what you are missing.    Francis Ford Coppola once said that at the end of the day nobody knows anything about what is a good movie or a bad movie, unless it stands the test of time and that's how you know what's great.

I think no-Arnold is actually a good thing here.  I've seen him plenty of times, and in this movie the cool factor and the focus is pretty much all on the Predator.  More Predator weapons are seen, you get to see the inside of a Predator ship, including a trophy room. (look for the scene of the window of a shop with stuffed animal carcasses for a nice comparison to our culture)People don't seem to like this movie, and I don't remember it thrilling me terribly the first time I watched it either.  Having recently watched it however, I think it's a great action movie.  It's not really set in reality, more of a near-future setting, so they can get away with the crime ridden city and packed police stations.  It's almost a comic book setting, but gritty enough to work in live video.  The director gave the movie a great claustrophobic feel. This movie has more action, more Predator, more Predator weapons, less characters that aren't a whole lot more than muscles, not that those kinds of characters can't be fun either.. and I think it's a lot of fun, and doesn't even get too out there.  The slaughterhouse scene could be very debatable with the silver suits and liquid nitrogen guns, but it made sense in the context they were using them, and I think those suits even look somewhat like the Predator's own suit, with the shoulder mounted devices and all.  Those suits were human technology to avoid detection by the Predator, the Predator's suit is technology to be stealthy against the humans.If you don't like a cool alien killing all kinds of people, shootouts, gritty city settings, and excess blood and explosions, what are you watching an action movie for in the first place?  I like the city setting much more than the jungle\/no-technology setting of the first film.  Don't get me wrong, I love the first film.  I'm a fan of the Predator in these movies, not Arnold, so I have to go with this one if I'm going to choose favorites here.
