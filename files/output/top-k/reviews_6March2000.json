Most of them have already been discussed by some of the other viewers who have posted here, so I'll just do a brief enumeration of some of the ones that stuck out in my mind (and this is far from a complete list)(POTENTIAL SPOILERS)1. Most obviously, the film's ridiculous misinterpretation of the double jeopardy laws...this might have been acceptable if it was just Libby's misunderstanding of how it works, but the movie has not one but TWO ex-lawyers presenting it as correct!  (I guess that's why they're EX-lawyers...)2. The idea that an insurance company wouldn't at least look into Libby's story, especially on a $2 million policy.3. Libby has a car dealer run a credit check on another character's social security number, while impersonating that character.  The credit check turns up that person's last known address, but not that she's been dead for three years.4. Travis leaves his prisoner alone in the car with one hand free, and the keys in the ignition.5. Nobody on the ferry notices as Libby noisily bumps into several of the cars around her, not even when she knocks one of them overboard.  However, when HER car goes over, everyone comes running.6. Libby fails to notice that the youth she's following in the cemetery is not only considerably older than her son would be, but is also carrying a beer.7. After knocking Libby out, Nick doesn't bother to make sure she's dead before dumping her in a potentially-escapable coffin and leaving her.  (Shades of Dr. Evil & Austin Powers!)8. After going to so much trouble with his evil plans, Nick casually (if vaguely) confesses to someone he barely knows.And those are just a few of the errors and plot holes.  However, the movie is far from a complete disaster.  Beresford's direction moves the proceedings along smoothly, no matter how far-fetched they are, and the performances of Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones are highly entertaining.I wouldn't say this movie was worth the effort of renting or going to the theater, but if it comes on cable or if a friend picks up the tape (which is how I saw it), it could make for enjoyable escapist viewing.

But first, let me say how disappointed I was that the writer\/editors failed to exploit the intriguing concept, however technically correct it was, of having someone able to kill her husband because she had already done the time.  I expected to find a film where the husband was always looking over his shoulder, not unlike the Julia Roberts character in Sleeping with the Enemy.  Instead, having used this concept as a hook to draw me in, they virtually ignore the idea, to the point where the husband seems more annoyed at having ex-debtees find out he is still alive than worried that is wife can kill him.  Bummer.  I never felt that the husband felt threatened by Ashley Judd's character at all.Now then, being a Washington Ferry Boat rider, I simply have to take offense that the car drove facing forward off the back of the boat.  Not often do they have you back onto the ferry--maybe it was a Southworth run on the Vashon ferry.  Not very likely.  Also, one heck of a lot of people simply sit in their cars, reading the paper or snoozing.  If some idiot were driving back and forth smashing the cars ahead and behind, then pushing one off, there would be attention paid immediately to the situation.  AND, that chain across the back (front?) is pretty firmly anchored in the deck with posts.  Oh well.I am also amazed to believe that Driver's License photos from people believed deceased are available six years after the death.

Really, it's like the author couldn't think of anything else to write about. `Write what you know.'  That's what the writing instructors tell you. But a novel about a writer makes it seem like writing is all you know. Who, except other writers, would want to read it?  The opening scenes of Wonder Boys, however, buried whatever hang-ups I had.  This story is less about writing than it is about the tortured souls that produce it.This film is a departure from anything I've seen before. Really, has there ever been another major studio movie set in Pittsburgh? It's about time. Here's another departure Wonder Boys triumphs as a character study. How many comedies can claim this? And a great comedy it is. Who can't appreciate the fact that one of the most important characters driving the story is a blind dog that's locked in a car trunk for most of the movie?Not to be upstaged by said dog, Michael Douglas turns in his best performance since Wall Street. Douglas plays the ultimate tortured soul, Grady Tripp, a much-respected, award-winning, and soon-to-be divorced University of Pittsburgh writing prof, wrestling as many artists do with a novel that refuses to end. One of his students, James Leer (Tobey Maguire in his best performance ever), is trying his hardest to be a poor, struggling artist and is looking to be inspired. James all but cons his way into Grady's life and the scenes between these two crackle with life. James has his own novel he's finished, and Grady's editor, Terry Crabtree (Robert Downey, Jr.), believes he's found a true `wonder boy,' the next big thing. The film then dangles these questions in front of us How will Grady find a balance between helping James, fulfilling James' expectations of his hero, and dealing with the fact that this kid is On The Verge while he himself is on page 1163 and counting?  Always poignant and dazzling, the film's writer never strays from his characters in favor of overdramatization. Many opportunities exist and Mr. Kloves always wisely passes.Grady's relationship problems are also piling up. The story takes place over the course of one weekend, and Grady is faced with one dilemma after another involving his married girlfriend, Sara (Frances MacDormand), the school's chancellor, his boarder and student Hannah (Katie Holmes, who will shine once she finds that good, meaty starring role), and of course his estranged wife (played by no one at all).There's a lot to love about Wonder Boys and I assure you I've merely grazed the surface. The real reason I went to see it, though it looked interesting enough from the trailers, was Curtis Hanson. I liked parts of L.A. Confidential enough to see what other tricks he has up his sleeve. I must say that his work here is much more accomplished than Confidential, despite the fact that most critics thought it deserved to beat Titanic a couple of years back. I hope this gives you an idea of just how good I think Wonder Boys is. Unfortunately, this is an early-year, low-budget comedy about scholarly people, and Mr. Hanson will most likely be recognized for the mystery thriller that came before it.I want to be wrong, so don't miss Wonder Boys.Grade A ","genre":null},{"date":"6 March 2000","score":"74 out of 86 people found the following review useful","review":"  I am usually annoyed by films based on novels about novelists.

I must say that his work here is much more accomplished than Confidential, despite the fact that most critics thought it deserved to beat Titanic a couple of years back. I hope this gives you an idea of just how good I think Wonder Boys is. Unfortunately, this is an early-year, low-budget comedy about scholarly people, and Mr. Hanson will most likely be recognized for the mystery thriller that came before it.I want to be wrong, so don't miss Wonder Boys.Grade A ","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"6 March 2000","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"      Had Robert Altman decide to direct a movie similar to his classic films of NASHVILLE and SHORT CUTS in 1999, he would have made a movie very similar to MAGNOLIA.  But instead of Robert Altman, we get the Altman of the next generation, P.T. Anderson.  Anderson is the same brilliant director behind the 1997 classic BOOGIE NIGHTS.  And unlike other directors who decide to do a major big follow up to their previous hit, Anderson does a smart job with doing a intelligent follow up instead of a big budgeted follow up.      MAGNOLIA is in the style of a Robert Altman film, it's a story that tells about different people's lives in the San Fernando Valley.  Before you say, SHORT CUTS rip-off it's not, instead it's a tale that is more told in a biblical sense. The stories in MAGNOLIA intertwine, first there is the story of a officer (John C. Reilly) who questions a woman (Melora Walters) who's a drug addict and becomes attracted to her.  Then there is former wiz kid Donnie Smith (William H. Macy) who is having a rough life, he just got fired from his job, and someone that he's intrested in isn't towards him.  There's game show host Jimmy Gator (Phillip Baker Hall)who's dying of cancer, and reveals to his long time wife (Melinda Dillion) his dark past.  Then there is the network executive of the network that airs the game show, Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) who is bedridden and is on life support, his wife (Julianne Moore) feels guilty about about marrying him for his money and finally feels love towards him.  Where there's Earl's caretaker (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) who is searching for Earl's lost son.  Earl's son is motovational talker Frank T.J. Plackey (Tom Cruise), who has no remorse or sympathy towards his ill father.      What I just said above is the complex plot that MAGNOLIA is about.  It is a movie that shows a lot of character study, but unlike AMERICAN BEAUTY, there is a much more complex plot and the end of the film ties everything together and makes sense.  There are even inside jokes in the film or foreshadowing that Anderson does show, but most would usually oversee, but I did catch it and it made the film even better.      MAGNOLIA is a film that does seem a bit like SHORT CUTS, with the stories of imperfect people in a imperfect environment. Also all of the stories to connect in some way or another.  But in the beginning of the film, Anderson does show a little story that deals with strange interactions that happen in people's lives that can really happen.  But what Anderson does is make the film in style.  He takes the Altman formula and puts a new style into it.  Anderson makes it into a a music video style, even at one point, having the cast members sing a song that's being played over the soundtrack.      But in the end MAGNOLIA is a masterpiece in it's own way. Anderson does a great job with his own take on a film with multiple characters.  Anderson even has two strong actors from Altman's NASHVILLE, Michael Murphy and Henry Gibson play small roles in this film.  It is a unique film, and I would consider it a cinemanic classic.  The acting is quite good, especially Tom Cruise in the role of the motovational speaker T.J. Mackey. And the way Anderson tells the story in the same style he told BOOGIE NIGHTS, does make this three hour plus film to go by quickly.  This is a film for those who when watching a film see beyond what's on screen will highly enjoy this film.  It's veryintelligent and visionary.  But for those who want to see what is on screen and for it to make some sort of explaination, better see something else.

And it lacks much of the energy a comedy needs to get your average audience member to sit through it without checking his or her watch. On the other hand, it's also got some laugh-out-loud funny lines, a talented and earnest cast, and the classic underdog premise.

No surprises there, since you know they're going to triumph. What makes it worthwhile is not the absurd, gaudy heroes and villains, but the dialogue and interplay between the characters.
