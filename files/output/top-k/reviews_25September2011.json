I guess watching it late at night after many beers can take away the impact of it somewhat though. This time, its morning, I'm a little hung over but nothing a good strong cup of coffee and a decent breakfast couldn't cure! I have to admit I haven't read the Stephen King novel on which it is based, but it is on my reading list. As a fan of the work of both Mr King and indeed Mr Kubrick I was more than thrilled to see this collaboration. More of my thoughts after this brief summary.The Overlook Hotel is in a very remote part of Colorado high up in the Rocky Mountains. So high up in fact that it is shut down every winter because the roads become impassable. To this end a caretaker is employed to look after the place during the winter months. This time around it is writer Jack Torrance along with his wife, Wendy and young son, Danny that gets the job. Before he starts, Jack is told of an incident a few years back where one of his predecessors had gone mad and murdered his family before unloading a shotgun into himself. Jack is not put off; he is looking forward to the solitude so he can work on his new novel. Oh, I should point out that young Danny has a special gift, one that doesn't go unnoticed by chef, Dick Hallorann before he leaves. Things start out well and the family soon settles into a routine. Danny goes off riding his trike around the long halls of the hotel while Jack writes and Wendy tends to the everyday maintenance tasks. When Danny starts to see things, (two strange girls), and Jack begins to lose his cool, it becomes apparent to Wendy that all is not what it seems at the Overlook Hotel. I'll leave it there as I'm sure there are one or two out there that may not have seen this one. And anyway, the Spoiler Police will be locking me in a store room if I say much more.The film is brilliantly shot with some truly iconic scenes and some beautiful scenery to balance it up. I must also say the music by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind really added to the mood and gave the film an extra dimension. Brilliant performances all round, particularly from Jack Nicholson, chewing the furniture and really letting rip as Jack Torrance and from Shelley Duvall as the put-upon wife Wendy Torrance. I also have to give a shout out for the young Danny Lloyd who coped really well with the (at times) demanding role of Danny. Finally, honourable mentions go to Scatman Crothers as Dick Hallorann, Barry Nelson as Stuart Ullman, Philip Stone as Delbert Grady and Joe Turkel as Lloyd the Bartender.Stanley Kubrick was a master of storytelling and also a master of the visual arts. I loved the look and feel of this film but, just occasionally, I found the dialogue got a little bogged down. It was almost as if it was lifted straight from the novel and didn't flow quite as well as it might. I can forgive that though because the film as a whole really works and I must give credit to all the filmmakers for that! Most definitely one I will watch again (without the irritation of commercials next time) and one that comes highly recommended.My Score 9.1\/10.IMDb Score 8.5\/10 (based on 222,736 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score 88\/100 (based on 49 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

This movie is slightly better than his truly abysmal Days of Heaven, but only just. He gives us dialog, but it is inconsistent or unintelligible at best. He gives us a plot, but it is weak and disjointed with no continuity. He provides us characters, but never delves into their motivations. He showers us with breathtaking images, but without purpose. My point is this if you give us these things, flesh them out or don't bother. Just don't do a half-assed job of it!You see, I understand what Malick is trying to accomplish. I hate miserable Hollywood tripe as much as anyone. He wants to emphasize that he need not conform to Hollywood standards of plot, or characters, or dialog. I wholeheartedly agree with this philosophy. I don't need to be spoon-fed like the typical American viewer with a 8 year old's attention span. There have been great films that lack some of these components. Kurosawa was a master of this. Kiarostami still is. When Malick tries to pull this off, he comes off as a two-bit hack. Compare Ran to The Thin Red Line. If you're going to make an art film, make an art film! The compromise that Malick tries to make in his films is not working. Is Malick's imagery spectacular. YES! Does it have anything to do with the story at the time? RARELY! Kurosawa could weave an intricate tale with absolutely nothing but imagery. Malick, on the other hand, just randomly inserts disjointed images with no apparent purpose. The fact that you can capture beautiful imagery is rendered moot when you don't know how to weave it into your story. David Lean's skills were also every bit as good as Malick's, but his were used for a purpose.I don't know why the fans seem so impressed with the philosophy of this film. The supposedly profound philosophical narration is straight out of a 9th grade English class (and I don't mean the honors or AP one) with lousy metaphors and childish vocabulary. I also don't understand all the stupid nature metaphors. Nature isn't cruel for the most part. It doesn't have malice. Trying to equate the savagery of human conflict to anything found in nature is idiotic. For instance Love. Where does it come from? Who lit this flame in us? No war can put it out, conquer it. I was a prisoner. You set me free.WOW! I am overtaken with, um, yeah, this is garbage. Imagine that! Soldiers have sweethearts back home and don't just dream 24\/7 about killing slants. I would expect insight this deep from students struggling through middle school. I'm not kidding here when I say that there is more profound anti-war philosophy uttered by Rambo in First Blood than this so called anti-war masterpiece. If you want to see a good anti-war film, see how masterfully Kubrick helmed Full Metal Jacket. If you want to experience what it's really like to be a soldier in a war zone, I think Black Hawk Down does a better job than this also. Malick comes off as a self-righteous, self-aggrandizing, pretentious two-bit hack when he tries to emulate the true masters of film.I can sum it up thusly if you are pretentious enough to think you can pull off a film without adhering to standards of plot, continuity, dialog, and character development then you bloody well had better be a good enough director to pull it off.

But the heart doesn't only pound from the thrills, Sea of Love is also an appealing love story disguised as a crime investigation, an entertaining flick served by great performances from Al Pacino as Detective Frank Keller and Ellen Barkin as Helen Cruger, his love interest, with a honorable mention to John Goodman as Sherman, Frank's very likable colleague partner. Likable is quite a fitting word to describe Sea of Love, the mood of the film is perfect for what it is, not too dark despite the sleaziest details of the murders and the adult content, but not too lighthearted either, it just works with the perfect dosage of humor, excitement and romance. I reckon I was very doubtful toward this film that I always regarded as a serious drama, and the first time I watched it, I was stuck by the humor that provided many memorable scenes, the introduction of Frank Keller, the blind dates, or more generally, the interaction with Sherman (no good cop and bad cop, both are genuinely good) and one of the most hilarious freak-out from a character who thinks he's going to be killed. The second time I watched the film, it was the romantic dimension that left an impression with me, the climate of suspicion and fascination that inhabited the heart of Frank while he was having a relationship with his own suspect number one. But Sea of Love is not just a mystery surrounding the investigation on a series of sexual-oriented crimes, but a powerful introspection into a very particular relationship, between two flawed characters who have both in common this mix of self-confidence and extreme vulnerability. And flawed is an understatement to describe Frank, alcoholic, he was left by his wife which left him with a bitter and aggressive view on life, a life literally collapsing as the perspective of retirement starts to mirror a dead-end condition. Frank is a good man and good cop nonetheless as shown in a clever scene where he prevents the arrest of a man, not to humiliate him in front of his son. Now to Helen, she is a divorced mother, trying to fill the emptiness of a sentimental life by any means. And between them, there's a killer, a mysterious woman who apparently answers to rhyming ads in the papers and kills her lovers while listening to Sea of Love before leaving the crime scenes and some lipsticks traces in the cigarettes found in the ashtray. Progressively, Frank and Sherman will elaborate an ingenious scheme by sending their own rhyming ad to attract the killer. This part possesses now, an interesting pedagogic value showing how people used to deal with love ads when Internet didn't exist.The magical encounter between Frank and Helen only happens at the first half-hour in the restaurant during the well-done blind dates scene, and the way both interact makes the growing relationship endearing in a realistic way. Helen, as the only woman who didn't leave her fingerprints becomes the suspect number one, but for Frank, there's another element that makes him attracted to Helen. And this is where the romance mixes with paranoia, suspicion and a delicate flavor of danger that contributes to the uniqueness of the story. It's a story of a weird but interesting relationship between two sympathetic characters, and thanks to Al Pacino's powerful performance, it becomes the evolution of a character who tries to fight his inner demons crystallized through this romance that waked up his most repressed feelings and drowned them in a passionate sea of love &#x85; Sea of Love is a remarkable thriller, a story of delightful lust and intense desire, and the sex scenes are handled in a good way as they're not just an excuse to throw some nudity and attract the crowds, it's like the highlights of a burning passion that was waken up between two fragile persons. But we know that it will never work as long as there will be this investigation, that would put a heavy weight of lies on a promising way to happiness, then the investigation becomes necessary, as we all know, this would be the turning point for Frank Keller and Helen Cruger. It's funny how the combination of their names create the name Helen Keller, as to sustain the blindness of a love that ignores all the bounds that could paralyze their relationship, lying, being a cop, fear, suspicion, stress &#x85; again, the relationship wouldn't survive the lies.If not the best thriller of the world, or the best romance, Sea of Love is one of the rare films that combine both elements in a very powerful way, on every department writing, acting, directing &#x85; it doesn't avoid some stereotypical situations, some elements have dated, but this is so minor considering the enjoyment following the story. And if only for having the merit to have resurrected Al Pacino's declining career, this film deserves a big and a sincere Thank you! Sea of Love or a movie you'll Love to See ...

But Sea of Love is not just a mystery surrounding the investigation on a series of sexual-oriented crimes, but a powerful introspection into a very particular relationship, between two flawed characters who have both in common this mix of self-confidence and extreme vulnerability. And flawed is an understatement to describe Frank, alcoholic, he was left by his wife which left him with a bitter and aggressive view on life, a life literally collapsing as the perspective of retirement starts to mirror a dead-end condition. Frank is a good man and good cop nonetheless as shown in a clever scene where he prevents the arrest of a man, not to humiliate him in front of his son. Now to Helen, she is a divorced mother, trying to fill the emptiness of a sentimental life by any means. And between them, there's a killer, a mysterious woman who apparently answers to rhyming ads in the papers and kills her lovers while listening to Sea of Love before leaving the crime scenes and some lipsticks traces in the cigarettes found in the ashtray. Progressively, Frank and Sherman will elaborate an ingenious scheme by sending their own rhyming ad to attract the killer. This part possesses now, an interesting pedagogic value showing how people used to deal with love ads when Internet didn't exist.The magical encounter between Frank and Helen only happens at the first half-hour in the restaurant during the well-done blind dates scene, and the way both interact makes the growing relationship endearing in a realistic way. Helen, as the only woman who didn't leave her fingerprints becomes the suspect number one, but for Frank, there's another element that makes him attracted to Helen. And this is where the romance mixes with paranoia, suspicion and a delicate flavor of danger that contributes to the uniqueness of the story. It's a story of a weird but interesting relationship between two sympathetic characters, and thanks to Al Pacino's powerful performance, it becomes the evolution of a character who tries to fight his inner demons crystallized through this romance that waked up his most repressed feelings and drowned them in a passionate sea of love &#x85; Sea of Love is a remarkable thriller, a story of delightful lust and intense desire, and the sex scenes are handled in a good way as they're not just an excuse to throw some nudity and attract the crowds, it's like the highlights of a burning passion that was waken up between two fragile persons. But we know that it will never work as long as there will be this investigation, that would put a heavy weight of lies on a promising way to happiness, then the investigation becomes necessary, as we all know, this would be the turning point for Frank Keller and Helen Cruger. It's funny how the combination of their names create the name Helen Keller, as to sustain the blindness of a love that ignores all the bounds that could paralyze their relationship, lying, being a cop, fear, suspicion, stress &#x85; again, the relationship wouldn't survive the lies.If not the best thriller of the world, or the best romance, Sea of Love is one of the rare films that combine both elements in a very powerful way, on every department writing, acting, directing &#x85; it doesn't avoid some stereotypical situations, some elements have dated, but this is so minor considering the enjoyment following the story. And if only for having the merit to have resurrected Al Pacino's declining career, this film deserves a big and a sincere Thank you! Sea of Love or a movie you'll Love to See ...

She works at a sales counter, yet has a nice place of her own and great clothes. She played a lot of shop girls, always having a knockout wardrobe, including over the top evening clothes and a very well appointed apartment. In the real world, a sales girl would have to be living at home or at the Y or have at least one roommate, and wouldn't be able to afford an expensive wardrobe. But, this is the movies, and we enjoy it that way. Also, really enjoyed Virginia Grey's part as the savvy sales girl who prickles Crystal while she's on the phone with Steven. Holy mackerel, what a line! With so much cleverness going on, that sequence doesn't get much mention, but she was priceless. How about that beauty clinic! What a setup.

It's a film about three men with very different stories who all find themselves in the same cell in a New Orleans prison. Tom Waits plays Zack, a lowly radio DJ with no future. John Lurie is Jack, a wannabe pimp who doesn't really have a clue what he is doing but pretends like he does. And then there is Roberto Benigni as Roberto, an Italian tourist who is desperate to learn about American culture and language, but has come to the wrong part of town to find it. Together, these three oddball characters escape from prison and go on a weird and offbeat, existential journey through the New Orleans swamp land.On the surface Down by Law seems like little to nothing. But it is the quiet subtleties that make this a rather ingenious film. On the surface it is a story of three strange men who escape from prison together. But Jarmush mixes in his witty dialect, astute characterization, and clever allusions to poetry that carry throughout the film to make it more than just a prison escape film. He disguises a sophisticated ingenuity about the film underneath simple quirkiness. He plays up a lively and rather simplistic nuance, only to sprinkle the film with a more intelligent air. The film really does feel like a smart film, whether you can place where the intelligence comes from or not.However, that's not to say that this film isn't fun, as well as funny. Zack, Jack, and Roberto are three great characters and they work so well together. They all have their odd quirks and strange mannerisms that make them all very unique people. There is some great banter between the three and plenty of moments that aren't necessarily laugh out loud hysterical, but pleasantly funny, eliciting a chuckle of approval. And then of course the unique way Jarmush shoots the film also makes it a very interesting watch for those with a keen eye for unique directorial ability. Down by Law is an effective exercise in intelligent shot framing as Jarmush shoots the entire film with very long still shots, or very long shots that make only subtle movements, making the direction of this film silently brilliant. Add to that the skillful black and white cinematography and it is safe to call this film a subtly excellent visual experience.Jim Jarmush almost always impresses us with his great usage of minimalist filmmaking techniques. He creates such unique stories that all have such quiet excellence that they become remarkably unforgettable films, even if you don't pick up on their brilliance the first one or two viewings. Down by Law may be one of his quietest exaltations of skillful minimalist filmmaking, but it is still an excellent film. Jarmush tells his story exactly how he wants to tell it, and he gives us, the audience, a unique experience to remember.

Basically Kesuke Miyagi (Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita), once an Army Sergeant attends a commemoration for Japanese soldiers who fought in World War II for the US Army in Boston, and there he meets his commanding officer's widow Louisa Pierce (Constance Towers). She then introduces him to her bad tempered and bratty teenage granddaughter Julie Pierce (young Hilary Swank), who lives with the memory of her parents being killed in a car accident. This has caused friction between her and her grandmother, but also with her fellow school students, but she also passes time caring for an injured hawk she has named Angel, kept in the school roof pigeon coop. At school Julie meets and befriends young and kindhearted security guard Eric McGowen (Chris Conrad) who works in the fraternity known as the Alpha Elite, and she also gains an enemy in aggressive student Ned (Michael Cavalieri), both are taught by vicious mentor Colonel Dugan (Michael Ironside). She finds herself being horribly bullied by the nasty members of the Alpha Elite, and after revealing that she used to be taught karate to her new friend Mr. Miyagi, he agrees to teach her more moves to defend herself. She learns balance, be co-ordinated, awareness of incoming threat, and to have respect for all life, and she becomes friends with the monks that Mr. Miyagi has helping her. When she returns to school she knows that Angel, who was initially taken by Ned but returned, is able to fly, and they release her into the wild, and is then given a new prom dress from Mr. Miyagi. For some reason there the Alpha Elite are order by Colonel Dugan to bungee jump and enter, and when Julie leaves she and Eric share a kiss, but they also get caught up in a proposed fight on the docks. In the end, Mr. Miyagi is standing back to let Julie use her newfound karate skills to defend herself in the fight with Ned who is encouraged by Colonel Dugan, of course she wins. Also starring Arsenio 'Sonny' Trinidad as Abbot and Walton Goggins as Charlie.

The video games we play are virtual non-reality games where we control another character, rather than being the character. But in the world of eXistenZ virtual reality gaming is all the rage. eXistenZ is a film about a game designer named Allegra Geller who is on the run from fanatics who want to kill her. The only person she has to protect her is a lowly marketing trainee named Ted Pikul. In order to find out if the her game has been damaged, Allegra and Ted must play the game eXistenZ. In the world of the game it becomes more and more difficult to tell who is friendly and who is not and what is reality and what is not. Virtual reality melds with actual reality in this twisting sci-fi action flick from the always wacky David Cronenberg.eXistenZ is a film that you absolutely have to watch all the way through before you pass any judgement on it. You can't finely critique the film until you know everything and have absorbed the entire plot. The plot moves at a rapid pace and maintains a level of significance, never wasting time with subplots that don't build on the story. Every moment of the film is important, all the way up to the final line. What's even better about the film is its hidden ambiguity. You think you're keeping up and you think you understand everything that is going on. You may even think that you have outsmarted the film with your astute observations that really only scratch the surface of what this film entails. But the plot then thickens and throws you for a loop towards the end with events you will never see coming.eXistenZ has managed transcend conventional laws of storytelling and it has found a way to exploit the traditional methods of telling a mind bending story. This is a very plot twist heavy film and towards the end it gets a little ridiculous, but the film wraps up in such a way that the plot twists were completely necessary to what the film is actually about. It's hard to explain without seeing the movie, so watch this movie. eXistenZ is a truly ironic film. It hides very clever filmmaking under sub-par storytelling. The film is a cop out, but in a good way.The practical aspects of eXistenZ are all decent, like acting, script, direction, etc. But where the film really shines, and the only place it intends to shine, is the way the story develops and unfolds into something unexpectedly brilliant. It is a film that is very proud of its plot and this is very obvious in the last fifteen minutes of the film. Cronenberg indeed pulled a fast one on all of this and he's very happy about it.

This was one of the reasons I downloaded this somewhat obscure movie. Roger Ebert's generous review was another reason (He gave it a surprising 3 out of 4 stars and praised both Roseanne and Meryl).The movie's plot is taut and simple, under-appreciated and unattractive housewife Ruth (Roseanne) envies beautiful women and does her best to bring her husband Bob (Ed) to the bed. Unfortunately, her husband has malicious eyes that cannot resist perfect female anatomy (no straight men can resist, but this man's a womanizer) and is easily allured by a popular romantic authoress Mary Fisher (Meryl), who in her interviews is shown to have an unblemished life. When Mary and Bob get intimate and Rob leaves Ruth, Ruth seeks revenge against Rob and Meryl. For this she has to destroy Bob's assets (thank god it isn't Rob's jewels, because that would've been painful!)-his home, his new family, career and freedom. This makes Ruth a 'She-Devil'.Jane Lynch would've nailed this role; the vindictive nature creased with an emotional touch that her character in Glee has is superbly conceived by Jane. Roseanne is however mediocre; she is like 'Precious' from the movie of the same name, playing Ruth, with slight laggardness does not make her character very likable.Meryl, on the other hand gives more skin to her character; I read a number of reviews that lambast her performance for being too wooden. Her character is uppity and pretentious, what more can she do? I've seen some high-class, good-for-nothing people talk and behave the same touch-me-not way, and Meryl gets that right. An exaggeration would have ruined her performance, since both Roseanne and Sylvia Miles (who plays Mrs. Fisher)'s characters are overly exaggerated. It's not an award-worthy performance, but it's great for a comedy. Some of her best scenes include (i) the outburst at her mother (ii) the bubble-bath-love scene when the kid interrupts and asks about the satellite dish and she gracefully turns around and goes back (iii) the last outburst. The supporting cast is all ordinary, with the only exception being Sylvia who is better-than-ordinary.Now there are some fundamental problems with the story, because of which I could not sympathize with Ruth. The major one, that has been mentioned in some other reviews too, is her actual revenge that is aimed at Mary rather than Ed. It's like the recent controversy in Karnataka, India, where the paramour of a top regional actor was banned for three years from the film industry after the wife of the actor complained to the police that the husband had beaten her up when she had confronted him regarding the affair. Here at least the wife and the law used their head and got the man arrested and lifted the ban on the actress. Ruth however destroys Mary for majority of the film and then targets Ed, though Ed seems more licentious.Another problem is with the consequences of the events. Ruth starts and employment agency to help women then makes them her weapons and on top of that almost destroys a woman's career. If in the ending, Meryl had gone to Ruth, apologized and made Ruth her publisher, and then it would've had a better alls-well-that-ends-well ending. This is Mary becoming Ruth and Ruth becoming Mary which is somewhat disturbing since I can't say then that Mary deserved it. Also, Bob never turns a better man, and Ruth forgiving him is just pathetic.

Meanwhile, chemist Barnaby (Cary Grant) has been trying to develop a youth formula for years. He drinks his latest formula but it tastes a bit off so he goes to the water cooler. Yep - he takes a drink of water and ....woah ........what's happening..? Well, he's the monkey's first victim. He starts acting 'youthful' and everyone thinks he has succeeded in inventing Life's Youth Juice. We follow Barnaby and his wife Edwina (Ginger Rogers) as they inadvertently keep consuming the monkey formula every time that they take a drink of water from the water cooler.....will the monkey get credit for the invention? The film has a cast that excites on paper but it doesn't live up to expectations. The whole beginning sequence drags - the first 15 minutes should have been thrown out. The cast are all likable but Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers are made to act out scenes that could be over in a couple of minutes as opposed to 'let's drag it out' for 10 minutes. However, opposed to the tedious, drawn out slapstick rubbish that we are offered, we are also given moments of comic genius.

For us rabid fans Twin Peaks reigns as the most original, most compelling, most memorable television series ever broadcast. Lynch's creations are often unclassifiable, never confined to a single genre, but Twin Peaks, more so than not, is a mystery thriller that also abounds with outrageous humor. The comedy normally arose from his deft handling of the intensely melodramatic atmosphere which he often interrupts with moments of unparalleled bizarreness. David exacerbates scenes of heightened sentimentality with audaciously maudlin music, nudging it into the realm of farce or parody. These tactics often illicit from the viewer a nervous chuckle that then grows into full throated guffaws as the scene plays out to increasingly demented proportions. The program ended abruptly after only its second season, and as it never truly revealed the mystery of Laura Palmer's murder there were substantial questions lurking in the minds of its disappointed viewers. The film set out to answer many of those questions and also manages to raise a few new ones, just to keep things interesting. Fire Walk With Me certainly isn't Lynch's finest film, and it really doesn't have to be because it only needed to conclude what the TV series had initiated. Freed from the confines of broadcast TV's censorship the film more confidently employs morally challenging, shocking elements. Nudity and profanity are effectively exploited to instill a more palpable, more visceral anxiety. Laura's sordid home life, which was only suggested in the series, is here fully revealed in all of its Freudian horror. The series leisurely developed its quirky rhythm by relying on its recurring hour long format for its unusual pacing, often taking three or four episodes to reveal a plot line. It was almost random in it's approach to narrative, jumping from one character to the next as the story veered and strayed. The film, however, is a much more focused character study with nearly every scene centered on Laura Palmer, with a single arching story line, progressively escalating in dramatic intensity. Fire Walk With Me very nearly succeeds as a fully independent film that is not entirely dependent on our familiarity with its particulars, yet it does derive much of its impact by how masterfully it takes advantage of our prior knowledge of the heroine's demise. Many films are built around the conceit that its destination is no secret, and a gifted storyteller makes that ride worthwhile. Lynch makes it thrilling. And hypnotic, and gorgeous, and entirely unique. There's no one even close to him for exploiting an audience's willingness to suspend disbelief, elegantly balancing an impossibly absurd combination of outlandish fantasy and soul gripping realism. His stunning visuals are matched by his irresistibly compelling audioscapes. Importantly, he is diligent to keep us acutely aware that what we're experiencing is in fact a contrived, fabricated illusion, which is exactly what a true artist aught to do - acknowledge the artifice of his (her) creation while dazzling us with superb technique. David understands intimately the magical & unspeakable role that cinema plays in the human psyche, and he tailors his art to our deepest desires, fears, and mysteries. It doesn't always make sense or obey common rules of logic but it is always thoroughly captivating. So even if you're baffled by the oblique plot and convoluted structure you can still be helplessly entranced by the macabre parade of lurid paranoia that marches across the screen. David Lynch's images and sounds are the best in the business.

I could experience that when seeing the film on the big screen lately on the occasion of its recent 70th birthday with other people. The exchange of viewpoints occurred to be a true exchange of perceptions. Let me address some points underneath where I will combine our impressions with some widely acclaimed opinions.When viewing Welles' movie, one's attention is directed towards the main character not through the traditionally linear storyline but through a flashback and other flashbacks within. We are led to know the newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) who dies in his vast dreamlike estate Xanadu, an oasis of his mind and wealthy life, and whose last, mysterious, absorbing word is 'ROSEBUD.' May he remain mystery, an enigma? Is his caution sign 'No trespassing' powerful enough? Or may anyone dare go deeper... Flashbacks, narrators and the attempts led by newsreel reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) help us get to know the man who has won so much, who impersonated the American dream, yet who is tormented by something mysterious - a man in the endless search for something that could make his life bright. Although so many people are around him, he finds himself alone... Despite some criticism, the portrayal of Orson Welles is truly special and sophisticated.All the supporting characters (the cast rather new to the motion picture industry of the time) are genuine, we empathize with most of them, they are the people whom Kane encountered in his life and whom reporter Thompson questions. However, after longer inspection, we realize that they are\/were nothing but background, more to say, aims by which Mr Kane gains success. They appear to be shadows that slowly disappear from his selfish mind the two women seemingly loved by the magnate, his wives Emily (Ruth Warrick) and Susan (Dorothy Comingore), his political rival Jim Gettys (Ray Collins), his friend and first reporter on the paper The Inquirer Jed Leland (Joseph Cotten) and the loyal friend and employee Mr Bernstein (Everett Sloane). All are gone at the face of selfish loneliness...Beautiful exemplification of falsely directed personal success and selfish desires that manipulate and affect a person\/people in the capitalist world. It also refers to the deception of politics. Where are the working men he seemingly cared for? Where are his rivals he challenged? What remains are cold statues and enormous halls. Can he prove anything to himself at the face of death --- this genuine, inevitable, merciless fate? The thought provoking content goes with brilliant artistry and cinematography's innovations. Great camera work in the large interiors, Gregg Toland's cinematography boasting of deep focus shots (where everything is in sharp focus), and Maurice Seiderman's make-up appear to be stunning. Among the most memorable scenes, let me name just two the thrilling action in Kane's conversations with his wife Emily and the atmospheric gloom in Thompson's visit at Bernstein. The way Xanadu's interiors are shot, the use of light and shadows leave a lasting impact in viewers, too. In such moments, the mystery of man nicely goes with the mystery of images.

They appear to be shadows that slowly disappear from his selfish mind the two women seemingly loved by the magnate, his wives Emily (Ruth Warrick) and Susan (Dorothy Comingore), his political rival Jim Gettys (Ray Collins), his friend and first reporter on the paper The Inquirer Jed Leland (Joseph Cotten) and the loyal friend and employee Mr Bernstein (Everett Sloane). All are gone at the face of selfish loneliness...Beautiful exemplification of falsely directed personal success and selfish desires that manipulate and affect a person\/people in the capitalist world. It also refers to the deception of politics. Where are the working men he seemingly cared for? Where are his rivals he challenged? What remains are cold statues and enormous halls. Can he prove anything to himself at the face of death --- this genuine, inevitable, merciless fate? The thought provoking content goes with brilliant artistry and cinematography's innovations. Great camera work in the large interiors, Gregg Toland's cinematography boasting of deep focus shots (where everything is in sharp focus), and Maurice Seiderman's make-up appear to be stunning. Among the most memorable scenes, let me name just two the thrilling action in Kane's conversations with his wife Emily and the atmospheric gloom in Thompson's visit at Bernstein. The way Xanadu's interiors are shot, the use of light and shadows leave a lasting impact in viewers, too. In such moments, the mystery of man nicely goes with the mystery of images. The music by Bernard Herrmann with his effective Breakfast Montage and the wit in the parody of vocal coaching supply the movie with the artistic\/entertaining merit.It is important to note that CITIZEN KANE is the double work by Orson Welles. In how much he was appreciated by many film scholars, let me quote the French New Wave filmmaker Jean Luc-Godard who said Everyone will always owe him everything. Welles, as an actor, beautifully portrays a man whose will and whose heart are the supreme driving forces, yet who does everything with consideration of himself. There is no doubt that he makes a lasting impression in the role. As a director, the views were quite diverse. Although we can agree that his stylish direction indeed helps the film considerably, certain criticism occurred on the topic of Welles' collaboration with Herman Mankiewicz on the screenplay. The criticism was also the result of proclaiming CITIZEN KANE officially the greatest film ever made. There is no doubt that such a fake expression will meet reproach. Some eminent people criticized Welles' film as an all-American triumph of style over substance (according to Ray Carney) or as a 'total bore' made by Welles, the 'infinitely overrated filmmaker.' (according to Ingmar Bergman). All things considered, it would be an unforgivable condensation to say that CITIZEN KANE is merely a historic movie. It is much more...if not directly, it addresses the core of individual\/social views on success and means of achieving it; it shakes the self-view of people and interpersonal relations; it brings to light the personal disasters hidden in the world-acclaimed maxim 'the end justifies the means.' People as means and wealth as the end? Yet, what stands for this 'wealth?' Things that say nothing, statues that feel nothing and...the merciless visitor that takes all? Then, the childhood memory, even if shortened of something, occurs a simple, redeeming relief...And what were our impressions after seeing the film? It inspired thinking and feeling.

The torn clothing and bared skin tells you how Hollywood hoped to lure folks away from their new-fangled TV's. Now, of course, the movie seems pretty tame, a lot less suggestive than our daytime soaps. But in 1955, it all seemed pretty raw.The first hour has a kind of charm, about a part of the country Hollywood never had much time for. By filming in Kansas, the producers got an unusual mid-western flavor, especially with the towering wheat silos and wonderfully colorful community picnic. Though pretty much stereotypes, the characters too come across in fairly interesting and entertaining fashion. But once Russell's repressed old maid goes into histrionic overdrive, the film collapses into the kind of heavy-handed soap opera that defined too much adult movie fare of the time. Too bad.This is the film that was supposed to establish Novak as a sex star, especially with the slow mating dance to Moonglow, a top ten hit of the day. But, to me, she looks more uncomfortable than sexy, and comes across as much more assured in the previous year's comedy, Pffft (1954), than here. But that's understandable since the studio pressure must have been great for a girl of modest talent, Columbia's Harry Cohn having sunk a bundle into promoting his protégé. To me, young Strasberg steals the film as tomboy Millie.On the whole, these star-studded soap operas don't wear well, being pretty much creatures of their time. What passed for adult fare then looks overdone now as each star gets a few moments to shine and justify the studio's investment. These moments, however, usually come at the expense of pacing and narrative economy, as they do here.At the same time, I expect modern feminists grit teeth over the few minutes of man-crazy hullabaloo in this film. Then too, someone should have thrown a blanket over Russell before she chewed up all the scenery in Kansas&#x97; what was director Logan thinking, I wonder. Anyway, the movie remains very much a reflection of a time when bare chests and heaving bodices defined cutting edge attraction for movie audiences.

So I watched carefully. But it's hard to pick up clues when you're scared most of the time. I did the best I could, and the mystery is not totally impenetrable, but regardless of how much of a Sherlock Holmes you can prove to be in a pinch--bring his bravery to the proceedings, not just his smarts; the film is a chiller.There's a lot of daylight. This happens in some Horror films, I notice. THE HIDEOUS SUN DEMON actually tried to turn daylight into a new fear factor, and while that film may not quite cut the mustard out in the sunshine, this film very slyly got me fearful of the well-lit rooms, and extra-worried about the few dark rooms the basement, the room with the chair.

Then you have someone find something sinister, and something cool. Then you make sure all the rumors to do with the creepy place just make it creepier. Then maybe someone goes missing, and the arguing heats up, and everyone seems to have a secret that they don't want revealed. And as the film makes you realize, with each day that passes, that it's difficult to tell if the edifice is warping the people or it just feels that way, you know in your heart that the blood will be near the end.So it's edgy, picking at your nerves, and it works very well without too much splatter, as many complex horror efforts do. But you can just feel that the payoff will be fairly vile, and on that score SESSION 9 delivers. This film will take multiple viewings by me to understand all the tricks and traps--where does human evil intersect with the supernatural malevolence that haunts the site of the ensuing tragedy, or are there any ghosts at work at all here?--but I certainly won't mind watching this nasty tale again. Psychological down-spiralling that happens to take place in a so-called haunted house means there is a certain beauty to the inexplicableness. The finale answers most questions, but like most horror of the mind, it's hard to say I can explain every scene now..

I had basically copped to where most of the trouble had been coming from--that's all I'll say--but I was still in for a few shocks when it came to the numbing details. So, can't complain too much. Well worth a look to Horror fans who like the sleek crisp tang of the modern stuff, and if you like a jigsaw puzzle (fresh from a blood-stained jigsaw, of course) then SESSION 9 will be Cloud 9.
