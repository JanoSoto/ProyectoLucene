The scarface killer is more intelligent, more brutal and more mysterious and a couple of surprises keep you hanging on until the end of the movie. The second part also focuses more on some of the stronger characters of the first part such as the intriguing and wrongfully suspected Cotton Weary, the journalist Gale Weathers that shows some unknown emotional sides beyond her facades of a seemingly egoist personality and the police deputy Dewey Riley that turns out to be much more clever and courageous than it seemed in the first part where he got completely dumped.On a negative side, the opening scene in the cinema shows already the main fan base of the first movie and one realizes that the main concept didn't change as the movie desperately tries to parody its predecessor, to include some stereotypical citations of classic horror movies and to introduce some new stupid teenage characters. The final conclusion to this movie is even more stupid as the ending of the first part and somewhat lacks of originality. That means that you still have to switch your brain off and look over details concerning annoying characters, horrible dialogues or lacks of originality in the script.Overall, this movie has still more suspense than the first part, concentrates on better actors and has a higher degree of dark atmosphere. It's a gripping flick that concentrates as much on the entertaining and humorous side of the movie as on the mystery and horror factor. I would say that this movie is easily the best part of the series until now but it can't mess with the classics of the suspense or horror genre.

Horror is my favorite genre and I do watch a lot of horror movies. American, European, Korean, Japanese, you name it. I am very sorry to say, this one might be big hit in its own golden time, it looks not only poor but I am afraid to say ugly most of the time, specifically in 2nd half.I liked the first part, the character build up, the natural 70s American youth life. The mad hitch hiker was bizarre enough, the lone convenient store, lone house etc etc. The first lapse in tight editing was the first two murders. I don't want to reveal much, as I have no intension to spoil anything. But from the name you will guess that there has to be couple of murders. Tension could have been built much there. But all the characters were being told just to scream or call each other's name. In 2nd half, in my opinion, the dialogs are worst and cheap. The screams were excessive and unnecessary. Which could have produced some nail biting moments, because of poor acting and lame editing, created some pathetic funny sequences.Honestly speaking, you may give this a try, but then, don't set your expectation too high. When I saw the rating over 7, I was expecting something more than 6-6.5 (for old movies I always deduct 1-1.5 sentimental over rating, old is always gold, isn't it? Not to me, sorry). But I couldn't push it over 5. Only good thing is, it was short (120 hrs) and stops suddenly(thanks God!). Also, no body tried to throw any morals which is a breeze.

With a generous dispersement of splatter and some truly priceless sight gags, Return Of The Living Dead distinguishes itself as a must-see entry in the zombie canon and delivers a mirthful dose of gross, outrageous fun in the process.The excellent cast, which features a perpetually nude Linnea Quigley and Friday The 13th franchise alumni Thom Mathews and Miguel Nunez, is obviously having a great time with the material, and their infectious enthusiasm makes the film impossible to resist. It would be easy for Return to slip into clichés with a band of punk-rock teens at the forefront, but the characters largely eschew stereotypes and emerge as a likable group of protagonists who play out even the most blatantly comical elements with a straight face.Though not an official sequel to Night Of The Living Dead, the film (rather audaciously, actually) explains away the cause of the zombie outbreak in George Romero's 1968 classic, openly referring to it by name and shattering the fourth wall by telling us it was only a movie. However, according to ROTLD, the scenario in Night was based on real events, and when enthused listener Mathews excitedly consents to see proof of this, the trigger for this deliciously droll zombie uprising is set into motion.It's interesting to note that Romero's Day Of The Dead was released the same year as this ersatz entry in the series, if only because the tones of the two films are as diametrically opposed as Ace Ventura Pet Detective and Sophie's Choice. Return may not yield the intellectual rewards that Day aspires to, but it does infuse a healthy dose of levity that is completely absent from Romero's stark and misanthropic (but brilliant, don't get me wrong) entry.Clearly, the FX here can't compete with Tom Savini's indelibly amazing set-pieces in Day Of The Dead, but there are a few gore-drenched scenes in this film whose execution and facetious tone clearly forge part of the blueprint for Peter Jackson's early work. Even when we end up seeing patently unrealistic rubber puppets, the sometimes clunky effects actually serve the movie well, since they heighten the splat-stick sensibility that is the driving force in Return.Zombie purists may be a bit miffed that cardinal rules of the genre are broken, the most blatant deviation being that the ghouls in Return Of The Living Dead can talk. Yet, the classic send more paramedics line alone merits the acceptance of this alteration of the mythos, and since a good chunk of the humor is derived from the auditory skills of the prowling creatures, I will respectfully suggest that if this idea bothers you, you're more than welcome to skip this outing and watch Lucio Fulci's Zombie again instead.Certainly, the film is a tad lopsided and admittedly uses up its best stuff in the first half, but the humorously bleak and effective ending bookends the movie rather nicely. When the end result is a huge smile on your face while the credits roll, it doesn't seem useful to complain about how that smile got there.Return Of The Living Dead is a truly one-of-a-kind experience that earns every iota of its cult classic status. If you're a horror fan who also possesses a sense of humor, your life really isn't complete until you've seen this. Uneven, sure, but absolutely brilliant just the same.

The thoughts behind this film are so large, powerful, and thought provoking, as well as being a film that can evoke just as complex thoughts for the viewer. The cast is equally as phenomenal as the film, especially John Malkovich. Next is the awe inspiring and beautifully done cinematography and editing. The whole setting of being realistic and ordinary and making something extraordinary come out of it, is fantastic. Being John Malkovich is a brilliant and instant classic. The first subject I would like to talk about is the concepts behind the movie. The major concepts are actually quite close to that of another recent movie title Inception. The idea that we can enter someone else body\/mind, and that we can be in control and live in another persons reality is what this movie is about. Yes they use a portal to get to that and that's where we know that this film is fiction and not real, But the idea of experiencing life through another person is reality. The incredible plot twists are what i love about this movie. It gets you to think outside of the box put keep you close enough to reality to make you think that this is, or could be, believable. It never loses the theme of human nature and the drive for love, That's why we get dragged into any movie, it's our ability as a viewer to relate, and empathize, to the situation and the characters in the film . Empathy is the act of feeling what another is feeling, being able to share that experience, that's what this movies about, being someone else, and feeling what they are feeling. That thought I think creates love, or an admiration about having something you can't have, and being someone you've only dreamed of. Being John Malkovich is a phenomenal film, It left me satisfied in the end, and the last 3 to 5 minutes of the film are very climatic. It really starts for me when every one leaves John Malkovich and all the old people go in, it then cuts to Craig where he's telling Maxine he still loves her while she and Lotte drive off. they then fade away almost making Craig seem like the bad guy. Then it cuts to the ending pool scene (which I will not ruin). I believe it is the key to the movie, and one of the best endings I've seen. It made me want to cry but at the same time I couldn't because I understood the meaning of the movie. Go watch Being John Malkovich, it's amazing!

It is a movie that has a fun yet creepy feeling towards it. It has kept me coming back for more and more year after year.PlotCharlie (William Ragsdale) believes that his next door neighbour (Chris Sarandon) is more than just a little odd, after a number of strange events and the disappearance of a women. Charlie turns to his family and friends for help and when all else fails, he asks for the help from TV show host and horror movie star Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall).Hot or NotFright Night is defiantly Hot a film that is there to entertain and is made by a director who clearly has an affection for the genre. While scary in places (especially the scene in Charlie's room) the film is very fun and has comical aspects to it and generally sums up 80s movies (fun music, cheesy effects, not to say they are bad for the time and full of colour). The film gives homages to many of its fellow Vampire sub genre films, including the Hammer and Universal, the scenes on the staircase resemble universals Dracula a great deal.Fright night tries not to steer to far away from the original principles of the vampire movie and it works perfectly. There are no guns and heavy weaponry like some modern vampire films and it doesn't dry and take away from the original principles. Chris Sarandon doesn't no kung fu and doesn't have an army of vampire ninjas.Sarandon you feel could play Dracula perfectly and you feel Gerard Butler may have based his Dracula portrayal on Sarandon's character in Dracula 2000. Peter Vincent is clearly a homage to peter Cushing and Vincet Price and portrays his role well as the Van Helsing character.Birds and the BeesWe get a pair of breasts from Jerry's first victim, however the ladies get the best deal in this film seeing Chris Sarandon shirtless and just being dam sexy.ActingChris Sarandon (Jerry) steels every scene he is in, the guy is very sexy and that is coming from a straight guy. He clearly appreciates the genre and knows how to play the role to perfection, cocky and argent but at the same time charming. Roddy McDowall (Peter Vincent) is comical and very funny you instantly warm to him. William Ragsdale (Charlie) handles his whiny part well, although did become slightly irritating. Amanda Bearse (Amy) as the innocent girlfriend didn't feel right, she seemed out of place and was one possible let down, one of very few that the film had. She seemed to old for the role, perhaps that was so her and Jerry's relationship was weird.OverallFright Night is possibly one of the best Vampire films around, it doesn't get much better. Horror fans, vampire fans and even fans of just 80s films will appreciate this movie. It has all the feel of a traditional Vampire film but at the same time has a splash of 80's flavor.

And I must call it what it is - John Woo is king of crap.First, the sequences take forever to execute - the guy is obsessed with slow motion. Then all at once the editing gets epilepsy inducing - way too fast and too disconnected for a viewer to realize what's going on. Too many closeups make you uncertain who is who. I've watched a making of where Woo's multiple camera setup was praised as ingenious... He shot Tom Cruise jumping onto a bridge on a motorcycle with more than ten cameras running simultaneously. It's not ingenious, it only shows that the guy is clueless about what he wants out of the shot. In that shot it took Cruise's character minutes to cover the jump that in reality takes three seconds. There were slow motions, there were repetitions from another angle and there was me yawning and pondering whether it's time to change the channel. And it goes like this through the entire feature.

It's strange that Peck hadn't experienced anything like this at all, even as a casual observer, when he was growing up.That's what is so brilliant about the character played by Garfield. He knows it starts on the playground, whether it be somebody being called fatty or chink (as I have been called several times, being of Korean origin).

It was a bold move to even scratch the surface of such a controversial subject. Not that it is anywhere near a riveting gem. Many scenes are way overlong and the Dorothy Mcguire character is a bit too one-dimensional. Celeste Holm deservedly won an Oscar for her smart performance, but I think John Garfield is the best written character in this whole endeavor.

Unusual for the fact that unlike Eastwood or Bronson, he had a relatively more action hero background he was a 6th degree (presently 7th) black belt in Aikido and has served as a personal bodyguard for numerous personalities. In short, all that he needed was a movie camera to follow him around and somebody could have made an action movie already. Most action movies of the era were rather low in the script department (Commando, Cobra etc.) and of course that would be very understandable since producers were undoubtedly banking on the popularity of the stars and the individual amounts of carnage each would inflict on screen. This of course would sit poorly with the more educationally inclined people and they have made it a habit to criticize each of the new movies of the genre and their countless spawn. But then let us face the fact not all of these movies are bad, brainless or both.

To be honest, I was told that the approach of Lang is rather sugary, and this has long stopped me from watching the film. However, Metropolis is a produce that you can not ignore. So, here is my review. The film is full of symbolism and myths, but Metropolis itself is simply what its name says. The peculiar thing is that all workers live in underground quarters, invisible to the middle and upper classes. Therefore, the mature son of the residential ruler and chief executive is totally unaware of the divided society, and leads a hippie-like life. One day, sister Maria comes from below together with a bunch of workers children, and shows them the lustrous life above. Maria, as you might guess from her name, is also the high priestess of the workers. She actually holds regular preaches on a churchyard. When the son sees her, he is impressed to such a degree, that he wants to visit her in the underground part of the city. She on the other hand, sees him as the Saviour (don't worry, he will not be crucified). The exploitation has driven the workers into a revolutionary state of mind, but Maria urges them to search for peaceful ways of change. Then the dictator orders his local insane scientist to make a machine man, a robot, which will duplicate Maria and incite the revolt of the workers. The reference to Frankenstein or Hide is obvious, but she also impersonates the human alienation. Apparently the idea is to beat down the revolt and make the workers more pliant. His plan seems to succeed, when the workers destroy the machines in the central power plant, which brings the economy to a grinding halt. In the end the underground city is drowned and the robot is burned on a pile, by the mob who now believes that she is a witch. In the mean time, the real Maria has guided all the workers children to the upper quarters. The scientist is killed by the son, who throws him of the roof of a cathedral. The dictator himself remains in power, but the son fulfills his task as Saviour and reconciles his father and the workers. And of course he marries Maria. The final text urges the viewers to merge hands and intellect with the hearth. Evidently, this abstract shows the many qualities of the film love, suspension and even horror, battles and mass scenes. The acting is somewhat theatrical. There is lots of biblical and religious symbolism, even references to Babel. The reformation is not depicted as the merit of the working class, who are only capable to revolt and destroy. Actually, the odd worker who escapes from the underground city immediately joins the lustrous life above. It is astonishing, but the real hero and the only man of virtue is the son of the dictator. So the political message of the film has a religious and rather anti-socialist tendency, without being a real plea for democracy. It may be explained by the spirit of the time (1927), when the catholic organizations had obtained a social color and were competing with the socialists. In spite of the theme, I would dub this film a produce and a warning especially for the upper middle class. For the rest of us the message is don't kill the machine, or your house will be flooded.

The film tells the basic story of Dracula (a Transylvanian vampire buys a house from England...) but makes slight changes to the story and actually changes the way Dracula (or Count Orlac as the vampire is called in the film) is killed since in the Bram Stoker novel he is simply stabbed but Nosferatu invents an entirely knew and innovative weapon sunlight. Its funny that what is considered to be one of the most well know facts about vampires and is a huge part of the modern vampire mythology is actually not from the Dracula novel but from the film adaptation.

It is also the oldest surviving movie adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula although the names of the characters in the movie were changed due to copyright reasons.

No matter how ingenious your concept and storyline are, if they're not presented properly they will no more thrilling than a dry account in a newspaper.Of course, one can't underestimate the importance of a good plot, and this one happens to be just such a work of ingenuity. Steven King's novel upon which Misery is based is one of the modern breed of real-life horror stories. These tend to be very effective if they can suggest a disturbing and perilous situation which any one of us can imagine and fear ourselves getting into. Granted, not every one of us is a celebrated novelist as Paul Sheldon is, but we could all conceivably be held at the mercy of some obsessive sociopath. And the business of the writer seemingly doomed to write the same trash over and over gives the story an added layer of interest, the characteristic hook that a good psychological thriller needs. Screenwriter William Goldman retains the core and most of the key aspects of King's novel, but condenses it well for the screen, also adding touches which keep it moving well for the motion picture format, such as the angle with the sheriff's investigation.And a good thriller, no matter how expertly written or constructed, needs a decent cast. Kathy Bates's portrayal of a murderous obsessive is incredibly believable in its superficial charm, mood swings and constant hint of the bizarre, but what really makes it brilliant is the way she works it for the needs of the movie. Her timing and delivery seem expertly calculated to make us wonder just when she will kick off again. In those moments of silence before she speaks, her expression is mysterious, unreadable, and we can't tell whether she is about to tell Paul she loves him or to savagely assault him. She even seems aware of the comical aspects of her own character, emphasizing Annie Wilkes's stranger utterances for comedic effect, without ever losing sight of the underlying realism of her performance. James Caan is very good too. His part here may consist chiefly of pained grimaces, but there is a certain art to that too which Caan has mastered.But these things would be worth little if they weren't put together properly. Misery seems like an unusual assignment for director Rob Reiner, who began his filmmaking career with the acclaimed mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap and followed it up with a series of warm-hearted comedy dramas like Stand By Me and When Harry Met Sally. And yet Reiner is an adaptable fellow because he does not seem to consider himself an artist &#x96; he simply applies himself to the needs of the picture, and as he himself has stated he actually set out to learn the techniques of making a thriller when he got signed for Misery. He learned good. Crucial here is Reiner's distortion of space, with lots of confusing close-ups and wide-angle lenses which flatten the foreground and pull the backgrounds forward. In the occasional wider shots of the bedroom where most of the movie takes place we see there is actually a lot of empty space around the bed, which gives us a bleak sense of isolation, and makes the surrounding walls seem all the more oppressive. Reiner even makes sure the scenes outside the house, such as those in the sheriff's office, are not too wide open, with few big landscape shots or visible skies. The audience may be privy to other goings-on, but we are not allowed to escape from the feeling of claustrophobia.The value of these techniques may seem a little tenuous &#x96; but they do genuinely work. Space, timing, and visual arrangements can have a strong psychological impact. It is crucial for a picture like this that we share in Paul Sheldon's sense of entrapment and helplessness. Reading a plot synopsis wouldn't be scary, but seeing the plot visually presented in the right way can be a terrifying experience. And this is also why there are so many thrillers out there that have a good idea but simply don't work in practice, or why sometimes an original movie can be brilliant but the remake is an unfortunate waste of celluloid. And the reason we don't often realise that we are being manipulated is that the very best directors do it so well we don't even notice.* * *Note This is not an attempt to disparage King's novel by suggesting that written thrillers are not as good as cinematic ones.
