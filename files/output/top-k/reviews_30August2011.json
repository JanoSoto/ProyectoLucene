Its all the more amazing when such a movie deserves such critical attention without succumbing to the obvious explicities of nudity, violence or drug use. Election, after all isn't about youthful indiscretions, it's a referendum on good 'ol American values like fidelity, democracy and Ferris Bueller.Mr. McAllister (Matthew Broderick) is a civics teacher at a suburban Omaha high school who aspires to be the best educator he can be. He has a loving wife, contributes to his community and commands a room full of precocious learners. Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) the class know-it-all however, may be a bit too precocious for his taste. While Tracy at first runs unopposed for student council President, McAllister recruits well-meaning jock Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) to act as a cog in her political machine. Things however start to get complicated when McAllister's personal life begins to unravel and Paul's sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell) jumps into the race.The characters from the original book Election written by Tom Perrotta were originally composites on the personalities of the 1992 presidential election. It translates slightly but each actor makes their part their own. The story is told from the multiple perspectives of its principle cast which stuffs the film's script with more irony than the phrase democratic republic. They each have significant flaws that make them unlikable yet fun to watch. Witherspoon's Tracy is especially enjoyable to see as she vigorously pursues her goals to the point of fanaticism. Broderick likewise shows his acting chops playing an anti-hero whose actions become increasingly more loathsome.There are tiny details in certain films that create a richness that, if nonexistent would be sorely missed. For 1999's Election, it's the score provided by Rolfe Kent. It punctuates important moments and highlights subtle frictions between characters often to hilarious effect. The moment Tracy finds out about Paul's candidacy the sounds of tribal chanting and shrieking is heard in the background as her face turns into a glaring scowl.I thoroughly enjoyed watching Election. The acting is top notch, the satire has a marvelous way of taking pot-shots at every sacred cow it can, and the details director Alexander Payne inserts are as poignant as they are rib tickling.http\/\/theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"30 August 2011","score":"","review":" Every once in a while you have a film about teenage life that is so biting and delightfully subversive that it should be banned from high schools everywhere (I mean that as a compliment).

After all, humor downsizes the significance of things right? Wrong. Like Charlie Chaplin, Roberto Benigni understands that humor can be a powerful tool to overcome all things bleak and cruel. When things look darkest, that's when we're in most need of a smile.The story begins with Guido (Benigni), a Jewish-Italian man who pines to open a bookstore. He meets a young teacher (Nicoletta Braschi) who despite her mother's objections, they fall in love, marry and have a child. Years later, Guido's love for his family is tested when they are brought to a concentration camp. Attempting to put a positive spin on the situation, Guido convinces his young son (Giorgio Cantarini) that they are involved in a game to celebrate his birthday.Keeping things humorous without undermining the gravity of the situation is a hard balancing act. Luckily there are no cheap laughs, thanks mostly to Guido's zest for life. No scene is spared from his exuberance and his brand of humor is never tactless or mean-spirited. His need to save his family is the driving force of the films second act and every small triumph or insurmountable obstacle he faces gives the audience a very real emotional reaction. There is one scene where Guido's hope for escape is met with soul crushing failure. He then finds a record and plays its loud enough for his wife across the way to hear to console her.One drawback to this film is the timeline. Are we meant to believe the allied forces stormed the camp only a few short months after Guido and his family's arrival? Additionally some may experience emotional whiplash from a film that evokes laughter and tears in equal measure. To them I'd say, WWII was an event that coaxed similar emotions and actions. While the war showed human nature at its ugliest, it also showcased us at our best. Benigni however is not concerned with geopolitical posturing and keeps his more caustic meditations on fascism sequestered in the first act. The human story is the important thing and God love him for realizing this.http\/\/theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"30 August 2011","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" A comedy set in a concentration camp during WWII may sound like a dreadful even downright offensive idea.

Alfred Hitchcock had just seen huge success with North by Northwest, and he was considered a master of slow burning, suspense cinema. He could have had any budget he wanted, any cast he wanted - in fact he could have done anything he wanted.So what did he do? He took a cheap TV crew, a virtually unknown cast and a script that a lot of people weren't keen on and he filmed it. He was the only one sure that it would work - so sure that he traded his standard paycheck for 60% of the net profits (earning him the equivalent of $150 million in today's money).The result...? The original slasher film that instantly changed the concept of horrors, thrillers and villains. This might not be as complex as Vertigo, or as relevant as Rear Window, but this is the film that changed cinema and paved the way for the likes of The Exorcist, Scream and most other slashers, horrors and thrillers. Hitchcock created a piece of cinema history with this film, and you would be hard pressed to find any film maker since who hasn't at some point used Psycho for reference.Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a lost woman. She wants to get away from everything - her job, her home, her boyfriend, her life. Her chance comes one afternoon when a rich tycoon leaves $40,000 in cash as a deposit for a house. Instead of taking the money to the bank, Marion steals it and goes on the run. After two days, she finds herself a little lost, but near a motel - The Bates Motel. She meets Norman Bates, a shy man who is looking after his invalid mother. She and Norman have a conversation, where she decides that she should go back home and face up to what she has done. However, that night, she is violently murdered by someone, and this coincides with an investigation into her disappearance - an investigation that leads to the best of Hitchcocks's climaxes.What makes this film so good? Well, Hitchcock said it best himself It wasn't a message that stirred the audiences, nor was it a great performance...they were aroused by pure film. This film exists only to terrify us, entertain us, move us, thrill us. There is no message, there is no moral lecture. This film is about one director's vision to take an audience on a roller-coaster ride of thrills and chills. And this film does that to perfection. Nearly all of Hitchcock's most memorable action is in this film (the infamous shower scene is just one), and they are handled so incredibly well that even now they can't cease to entertain. The direction is the winner here. The carefully planned shots, the black and white images, the lighting, the shadows - nothing here has been left to chance and everything has been thought out so, so well. Stanley Kubrick is often accredited with the 'Kubrick stare'. Yet it might well be that he took that idea from Hitchcock, who's final shot of Norman Bates is one of the most chilling and unforgettable shots in film.Of course, whilst this film is brilliant almost exclusively because of Hitchcock's expert direction, we can't forget the cast. Janet Leigh was immortalised in her role as the ill-fated Marion Crane and she does a wonderful job as the woman who is essentially lost in her own life. Martin Balsam adds a touch of class with his portrayal of Arbogast, the private detective. And Vera Miles is strong and effective as Marion's worried sister.But, this acting in this film is virtually owned by Anthony Perkins as the truly chilling Norman Bates, who is arguably the best villain in film. Every second that he is on screen, you know there is something wrong, you know that this sweet, innocent, shy man is hiding a terrible secret. You're afraid to know what it is, but Perkins uses the screen to tease, to make you want to know more about him even though you know it's horrific. Perkins was so good in the role that it actually typecast him and hindered the rest of his career.Between Hitchcock's direction and Perkins acting, there is enough horror to last a lifetime.

I have often wondered in the last thirty years if Dunaway ever wished Bancroft had kept the job. For MOMMIE DEAREST was to go down in history as the film that wrecked Faye Dunaway's career; it made her all but unemployable for several years, and the films she did get were pulp like THE EYES OF LAURA MARS.MOMMIE DEAREST is an illustration of the Peter Principle at it's apotheosis. For starters, the original book, written by Crawford's adopted daughter Christina after being disinherited by her mother, was, shall we say, questionable, but it sold like hotcakes (Hollywood dirt always does). Had they made even a half-assed attempt at a faithful adaptation they might have had something, but the movie is a mess of disjointed scenes with no rhyme or reason to them; perhaps this reflects the fact that no fewer than four writers toiled on the script.Not that everything is a failure. This is a marvelous-LOOKING production; every visual period detail is lovingly recreated, and Dunaway's makeup is pretty good, though she really does not, in the end, look like Crawford (Bancroft might have fared better there), and at moments it looks more like a mask than makeup.But the bottom line is the acting, particularly by Dunaway. Christina is played very effectively as a little girl by Mara Hobel, then pops up as Diana Scarwid, sporting a sudden and unexpected Southern drawl. Scarwid is not bad, though; despite the accent, she seems to have a good grasp of the character, and she wisely answers the excesses of Dunaway by underplaying the role.Dunaway, in a word, is a disaster. Overacting was always her worst failing, and director Frank Perry lets her do that all over his film. The makeup doesn't work, Dunaway is much too tall, and the manic scenes are simply explosions for which no explanation is offered (though there wasn't always one in the book either).I happened to see this thing in a theatre in New York when it first opened, and the audience, myself included, found most of it utterly hilarious. When Dunaway screamed NO WIRE HANGERS!!!! with about three and a half pounds of cold cream on her face and her eyes so wild they were crossed, we were in a rapture of hilarity.It's really rather sad, I guess, that a woman who had as difficult a life as Crawford allegedly had left such a tacky legacy. But whatever JOAN Crawford may have been guilty of, it was Christina Crawford who wrote this thing. I had my doubts about it, and I still do. But to give her credit, the book was at least plausible. The film is a God-awful mess.Incidentally, the book was reissued in both a Twentieth Anniversary edition and a Thirtieth Anniversary edition a decade later; I gave the former a pass, but I recently succumbed to curiosity and read the most recent version and it pointed up something I had not noticed before the abuse tales told by Christina were never corroborated by anyone; a biography of Crawford by Bob Thomas at around the same time mentioned a couple of incidents, but neither of them are in Christina's books although the hair-cutting scene, which also did not appear in Christina's book, wound up in the movie.

He then meets the girl of his dreams (Kim Greist) and thus begins his baptism by fire.Brazil plays like a cross between Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four and a Roadrunner cartoon. Bulky Rube Goldberg-like machines and unattractive air ducts populate the screen only to be outdone by a vast and ineffectual bureaucracy.

Those who fight the bureaucracy like rogue air-condition repairman Harry Tuttle (Robert De Niro) are enemies of the state. Meanwhile poor, meek Sam struggles to keep his head low and eventually becomes overwhelmed by the sheer madness of it all.In many ways the audience is meant to feel the same sense of bewilderment.

It packed a tense punch then, and still packs a tense punch now. Whilst I don't think it has the emotional depth that say, Vertigo does, it still remains the greatest example of Hitchcock's ability to take a simple plot and turn it into something much, much deeper.Rear Window is set in a small New York apartment, where L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) has broken his leg and is wheelchair bound. He is also a totally dedicated photographer, a man willing to further than his competitors for any photo (as is seen in the film on numerous occasions). Having been stuck in his wheelchair for some time, he has taken to watching his neighbours during their daily lives. He is warned by his nurse, Stella (Themla Ritter) that there will be trouble if he continues to watch, and that he should instead focus on his girlfriend, Lisa Grace Kelly). Sure enough, he doesn't listen and he's soon drawn into what may or may not be a murder, leading to a hugely tense climax towards the end.Rear Window strikes me as two things. Firstly, it's a very early example of Big Brother, or another reality TV show that's like it. The neighbourhood is the show, L.B. Jeffries and we are the audience. Together, we sit and watch the neighbourhood, the neighbours. We see the newly married couple and wonder what is happening behind the closed curtains. We see the musician attempting to create a piece of music that will ignite his career. We see the sculptor. We see the beautiful dancer and want more. We see the lonely woman who desperately wants someone in her life - and we enjoy every second of watching these people as Hitchcock carefully sets us up, just as L.B. Jeffries has been set up, to be witnesses to what may or may not be a crime depending how we choose to view the evidence. And then, when we sure a crime has been committed, we can do as much as any man with a broken leg can do - nothing.Seondly, Read Window is an example of how the power of suggestion can be used to manipulate an audience. Hitchcock is very careful never to show anything - this film is based on suggestion. We know there is a married couple, but we're not sure how their relationship is progressing. We know there is a musician, but we know little of his career. We know there is a lonely women, but we don't know why. We think there has been a murder, but there is no real proof. Hitchcock never shows us anything. He merely uses the power of suggestion.This truly is a magnificent thriller, and is one of Hitchcock's finest examples. Hitchcock slowly builds the tension right from the start and teases us with glimpses of something horrific. We think something has happened, but we have no proof. We want to know more, but can't because we are as useless as L.B. Jeffries. When the action scenes come, they are some of the most tense in the history of film, yet they are so simply. To compliment Hitchcock's directing, there is also the hugely talented cast. James Stewart is in every scene of this film, and it's a credit to him that he's able to so effectively pull off this level of acting. In turn, he is supported by the enchanting Grace Kelly and the entertaining Thelma Ritter.One of the finest examples of thriller, that uses only the power of suggestion and the idea of Big Brother to create so much tension. This shows why Hitchcock was truly the master of suspense - he uses only suggestion to create and idea. We're the ones who then take that idea and expand upon it. If only modern slasher thrillers built up suspense like this does. For those who enjoy this film, I'd also recommend Hitchcock's Rope, which could be viewed as a twin of this - except it's set in the murderer's apartment instead.

In turn, he is supported by the enchanting Grace Kelly and the entertaining Thelma Ritter.One of the finest examples of thriller, that uses only the power of suggestion and the idea of Big Brother to create so much tension. This shows why Hitchcock was truly the master of suspense - he uses only suggestion to create and idea. We're the ones who then take that idea and expand upon it. If only modern slasher thrillers built up suspense like this does. For those who enjoy this film, I'd also recommend Hitchcock's Rope, which could be viewed as a twin of this - except it's set in the murderer's apartment instead.

It packed a tense punch then, and still packs a tense punch now. Whilst I don't think it has the emotional depth that say, Vertigo does, it still remains the greatest example of Hitchcock's ability to take a simple plot and turn it into something much, much deeper.Rear Window is set in a small New York apartment, where L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) has broken his leg and is wheelchair bound. He is also a totally dedicated photographer, a man willing to further than his competitors for any photo (as is seen in the film on numerous occasions). Having been stuck in his wheelchair for some time, he has taken to watching his neighbours during their daily lives. He is warned by his nurse, Stella (Themla Ritter) that there will be trouble if he continues to watch, and that he should instead focus on his girlfriend, Lisa Grace Kelly). Sure enough, he doesn't listen and he's soon drawn into what may or may not be a murder, leading to a hugely tense climax towards the end.Rear Window strikes me as two things. Firstly, it's a very early example of Big Brother, or another reality TV show that's like it. The neighbourhood is the show, L.B. Jeffries and we are the audience. Together, we sit and watch the neighbourhood, the neighbours. We see the newly married couple and wonder what is happening behind the closed curtains. We see the musician attempting to create a piece of music that will ignite his career. We see the sculptor. We see the beautiful dancer and want more. We see the lonely woman who desperately wants someone in her life - and we enjoy every second of watching these people as Hitchcock carefully sets us up, just as L.B. Jeffries has been set up, to be witnesses to what may or may not be a crime depending how we choose to view the evidence. And then, when we sure a crime has been committed, we can do as much as any man with a broken leg can do - nothing.Seondly, Read Window is an example of how the power of suggestion can be used to manipulate an audience. Hitchcock is very careful never to show anything - this film is based on suggestion. We know there is a married couple, but we're not sure how their relationship is progressing. We know there is a musician, but we know little of his career. We know there is a lonely women, but we don't know why. We think there has been a murder, but there is no real proof. Hitchcock never shows us anything. He merely uses the power of suggestion.This truly is a magnificent thriller, and is one of Hitchcock's finest examples. Hitchcock slowly builds the tension right from the start and teases us with glimpses of something horrific. We think something has happened, but we have no proof. We want to know more, but can't because we are as useless as L.B. Jeffries. When the action scenes come, they are some of the most tense in the history of film, yet they are so simply. To compliment Hitchcock's directing, there is also the hugely talented cast. James Stewart is in every scene of this film, and it's a credit to him that he's able to so effectively pull off this level of acting.

There are great action set pieces, some slick dialogue, some sparkling acting and some fantastic direction from David Fincher. But, in the end, where does it really lead? Not really anywhere. Fortunately for this film, because there is so much going on, you can afford to forgive the ending. Nicholas Van Orten (Michael Douglas) is a cynical, detached banker. He has an ex wife he takes no notice of. He has a brother who is clearly disturbed and he has to live with the knowledge that his father committed suicide in front of him. He lives only to make business deals and cares only for money. That is, until his brother gives him a birthday present - a ticket for something known as 'The Game'. Reluctantly, Van Orten signs up to this game, little realising that he's opening up a total nightmare. Soon, he is apparently the victim of fraud, his house is broken into, there are attempts to kill him and his brother is apparently committed. Van Orten is left to try and solve everything himself, using only his wits and whatever sense is left in him. Make no mistake that this film is worth watching. For several exceptional reasons. Firstly, the script and in particular the dialogue is pretty sharp with some cracking action and some good dark humour. Secondly, David Fincher directs this with his usual talent for dark atmosphere and slick action. There are some exceptionally good action scenes and some carefully crafted talk scenes that always move the film forward at breathtaking pace. Finally, the acting it absolutely outstanding. Every part in this film is cast as perfectly as possible. Michael Douglas shines in a role that he is always so well suited to. Sean Penn, someone I'm not usually keen on, adds real paranoia and depth to his scenes, and the two leads are then supported by several very talented character actors that give more than the film gives them in return. The problem here is the ending. It's not all that believable, and feels more like a last minute cop-out because they were either nor sure how to end it, or were too afraid to make it even darker. The ending isn't just unbelievable - realistically it's not possible. After suffering all that he does throughout the film, there's little chance that Van Orten could take that one final twist. He'd either be insane, or a broken man. Instead what we get is something a little too happy, and not dark enough for the rest of the film. However, ending aside, this film is very, very good. I'd still recommend it, even if just for everything up until the ending, the first rate acting and the atmospheric and slick directing.
