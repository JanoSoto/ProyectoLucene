The first time I missed a bit of the murder plot, but repeated viewings just enhance the movie.It has started making me wanted to go out, get a terrier and call it Asta, drink too much for my own good and become a private eye detective. And move to New York. The lovable couple make it all look fun, and even if they do drink too much. Only after I have snapped out of admiration mode for the movie I remember that they were highly paid actors following a script in a hit film of 1934, and I'm living in the year 2000, cannot get a dog, am living in Sydney, and worst of all, I'm fourteen, so I can't drink or become a detective. Such is the modern manner of the movie. It is one of the very few films of its time that retains its freshness, intrigue and brilliant humour. William Powell and Myrna Loy are incredibly likeable, the wisecracking darlings of society who we all want to know. Their performances were both absolutely brilliant! Some of their antics are a good deal wilder than those we are used to, but in fear of being caught up in murder would keep me away from them, but not long enough. I don't believe there are any shallow characters at all. Thank goodness for The Thin Man. One of the first to show an affectionate couple in love, I'm still scanning for the same in movies of the 50s. W.S Dyke is of course not one of the most remembered directors of his time, but for this alone he could be considered a great director. He was not Alfred Hitchcock, but he successfully combined high comedy, crime and thrills into one film. No wonder the major film studios were hot after this property.  And Dyke didn't have to rely on the excruciatingly hilarious elements of slapstick. A married couple and a dog was all that was needed. Such a simple thing to emphasise on, and how well it worked! Could there be a more stolen plot of today?Unfortunately, MGM, despite creating one of the best teamings of the era by putting the platonic Powell and Loy together, released this film in 1934. A nominee for Best Picture, Actor and Director, among other things, it was Capra's It Happened One Night that made history by becoming the first film in history to sweep the five major categories at the Oscars. If it had been released in 1933, it would have beaten the now forgotten Calvacade, in 1935 it may have swept some Oscars up against Mutiny on the Bounty. I wonder why Loy was not nominated. The film simply could not have been done without her.Powell and Loy went on to make many movies together. Asta, appeared again as George in the 1938 slapstick masterpiece Bringing Up Baby.Although we need some good movies now, no one should even think contemplate for a split second on a remake. There is no way justice could be done to this film. It is a comic masterpiece that continually tricks the viewers, and without a doubt, one of the very best and brightest movies of the 1930s.I hope I can watch the other Thin Man movies.

That's right, Popeye's purpose was to sell newspapers long before he hit the theaters as an animated short subject star, and this movie brings to life those characters such as Rough House the cook and Bill Barnacle the town drunk that appeared in the Thimble Town Theater strip (and then later, Popeye comic strip).  It also brings along some of the subject matter usually handled in daily newspaper comics such as tariffs and land barons. Perhaps this is why Robert Altman, not a director known for family films, was brought onto the project.  (Screenwriter Jules Pfeifer incidently started out as a comic strip writer before venturing into adult film projects such as Carnal Knowledge and Oh! Calcutta.)  The problem is that the film should have been made, could have been made, in the early forties.  The audience would have at least understood the subject matter (For example, the delightful Blondie film series is now great nostalgic slapstick fun but younger audiences don't have enough understanding of WW2 family life to appreciate it fully).  Most audiences who watch the live action version of Popeye are expecting the cartoon series of the fifties (or egad, the 70's!). The contemporary newspaper crowd (who is the usual intended target of Altman) grew up with Popeye on TV, not in the comic strip, not on the silver screen sandwiched between newsreels of battleships and the latest W.C. Fields comedy!  Would they even understand the appropriateness of sweet sea chanties?  Some sort of concession was made by having the actors mimic the characters as portrayed in the film cartoons.  They do a really good job with it too.  Robin Williams has the under-his-breath mumble, the hick-upy laughter, the stance, walk, bulging arms that do helicopter blade turns in a fight.  Shelly Duvall (a former Robert Altman protege) pegs Olive Oyl perfectly, especially with her waving of arms and pretzel twisting of legs as she tries to turn around in confusion.  Just watch her walk out of a room and it seems like your watching a cartoon.  Together, Williams and Duvall have real chemistry and are a delight.

In  1994, we had classics like The Shawshank redemption and Pulp fiction who were in nomination at the Oscars and were stolen in every category in which they were nominated.  They were all stolen by Forrest Gump.  These two other movies which were completely different in their style from the movies of the same genre as them but who came before them were completely over-looked.  And the worst part is Forrest Gump is simply the biography of Forest Gump.  Also, it robbed every movie in the best actor category.  Of course it isn't that easy to play someone who is mentally ill but it's easier than playing just some ordinary person and playing it well.  Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) lives with his mother and comes from North-West Alabama.  However, he has a slight mental deficiency and a leg problem for which he must wear a brace.  When he starts going to school, he is rejected by everyone except the bus-driver and a young girl named Jenny.  One day after school, while Forrest and jenny are hanging together, they are surprised by a bunch of boys from their school who start throwing rocks at Forrest.  He tries to run away but because of his bad leg, he can hardly get away.  This is the classic scene when Jenny yells Run Forrest, run. and as he runs, his brace starts to come off and the boys who were chasing him are unable to catch up to him for he is too fast, even though they have bikes.  As the years pass, Forrest and Jenny (Robin Wright Penn) go their own way.  Forrest gets into the army and goes to Vietnam.  But one night in the camp, all the soldiers are in bed and pass on a Playboy magazine.  When Forrest gets it, he realizes Jenny has her photograph in it.  Further on during the war, he saves the life of his lieutenant named Don Taylor (Gary Sinise) but loses his best friend Bubba.  Also, his lieutenant is left legless because of the accident whereas the only Forrest gets is a bullet in the butt.  When Forrest gets home, he as many things to do.  On of them is to go over to Bubba's parents' house to announce to them he was killed in combat.  Another thing he does is try to find Jenny.  The movie is a kind of comedy-drama and is pretty good.

I actually believe that the one who deserved an Oscar more than anyone else in the movie is Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Don Taylor.

While it's certainly no 2001, or even as good as the underachieving Event Horizon, it's much, much better than say, Wing Commander, or Lost in Space. Now those movies were embarrassing. Supernova wasn't really bad, it's just that it would have been better suited to being an Outer Limits episode than a full length movie.

I cared very little for these characters... does anyone else think I'm writing a review for Star Wars Episode 1? With the exception of the sci-fi\/horror reference, I wouldn't be surprised. Everything in this movie is understated--the exact danger that James Spader poses as a recovering Hazen addict, the conflict between Spader and Angela Bassett, the HAL-like character of Sweetie (her voice was one of the two best parts of the movie for me, the other being the Scream 3 trailer that played before the feature), the pure horror of Peter Facinelli and what his character is turning into.  Also, the aesthetic. The shaky, overdramatic shots, the odd placement of characters within a frame. It works great for The Blair Witch Project, but not here. I wasn't expecting a great movie, I didn't go into this movie to be blown away--I expected little, but I got even less than that out of the movie. The trailers for this movie were better than what it advertised! And the ending--stop with the cheese, please! If what happened to Robert Forster at the beginning of the movie happened to the survivors, maybe I wouldn't be as disappointed. I was planning on starting this year's movie viewing off right.

Still, the movie was fast-paced and fully engrossing.And then, about 20 minutes before the end, it begins to collapse! The mathematical calculations become IMPOSSIBLE to decipher and follow. A major character changes his behavior completely. And the ending is a real disappointment. Some people have said it's surprising; I think it's a total cop-out. It doesn't provide any explanations, and it doesn't provide any clues for us to try to figure it out on our own. I watched the last five minutes three times.
