While I am a huge film fan, I rarely go to the movies in theaters anymore because everything just looks so BAD. The last film I have seen in theaters was actually Spider-Man, a great film marred by the horrible cartoonish special effects.My tastes in film vary greatly...I love the classics (Cagney, Bogie, etc), romance, B-flicks, Godzilla films, car chases, superhero stuff and much more. However, almost all the films I like were made before the 90's, when film started to get REALLY bad. I also love to observe a good phenomenon - whoch Titanic became almost instantly.I read all about Titanic before it was released, how the budget went up to a staggering $200 million making the film a tremendous gamble. When it was released in late '97, it did very good but not great numbers - but the word of mouth on this film was unlike anything seen since Star Wars probably - the box office take remained steady for a LONG time. As weeks went by, it actually earned more and more, and the phenomenon had started.Then in late 1998, when the film was still playing some theaters almost a year later, and for a whole year we've heard how unbelievable Titanic was and how Leo was adored by girls all over the world and how hot Kate was - I finally kicked in 2 bucks at a discount theater to see what all the fuss was finally about. Alone (in a packed theater) as not to be distracted by a friend, I got my snick snacks, found my seat, and watched with a completely open mind.Three hours later, I, who again hates virtually everything mainstream these days, said to myself, that was one of the greatest films I had ever seen.Many say Titanic is fomulatic, typical Hollywood drivel, and the famous, ...but we know the ending, the ship sinks. I say, Titanic was an extremely rare present-day excursion in old-school grandiose film-making. Huge sets were built as opposed to having everything drawn with computer effects. It was a great romantic story, which the audience was compelled to feel for, especially having the knowledge ahead of time that it would be doomed (the ship sinks). It had great drama, great music (even the one song I can stand hearing Celine Dion sing), and a lot of heart from James Cameron who, love him or hate him, showed amazing dedication to getting his epic on screen.And say whatever you want about Leonardo DiCaprio - he was excellent in Titanic and is one of the very best actors out there right now.Anyone who has read some of my other reviews would know that I hate computer effects. But the CGI in Titanic is the one instance where they actually do work a little, because they do not overtake the picture and aren't the focus. It definitely is not the same as watching a cartoon Spider-Man battle a cartoon Green Goblin in a film that is not supposed to be a cartoon.Titanic, dare I say, is the Gone With The Wind of our time. it's a huge movie, a blood, sweat and tears movie, a movie with some real elbow grease behind it. And never boring for a second.Titanic is arguably the best film of the 90's (only Goodfellas gives it a run for that title in my opinion), and is probably one of the greatest 40 films ever made. Now that may be a surprising thing for me to say given I am such a huge fan of the classics, but however rare it may be, there are extremely rare instances when something new is in the same league as something classic.One last note - it is surprising that this film has such a bare-bones DVD out. While there are rumors that a special edition DVD is in the works, the present DVD is a disappointment with no extras at all. Considering this movie at three hours long had two hours CUT from it alone would make some good extras in deleted scenes. Add on the commentaries, a few makings of and add on a bunch of other crap and you have got a killer, proper DVD release for Titanic.

Needless to say, things don't go totally to plan and, after Harry collects the money, things go badly wrong and he finds himself desperately trying to get out of the web he is caught up in.An ex-con gets approached by a gorgeous woman and is seduced into committing a simple crime - typical noir territory, cue a twisty thriller where things that are presented as facts turn out to be lies etc.  The plot is quite good even if I was waiting for the twists rather than having them come out of leftfield at me.  The lack of real surprises was a problem for me as it did turn the story into rather a workmanlike affair at times.  The characters aren't great either.  Aside from Harry all the others are basic cardboard cut outs of characters rather than being well scripted people.Harrelson does a good Harry, he has a sort of haggard yet oafish character here who is always one step behind and Woody can do that quite well.  Shue is OK as the supposed femme fatale but I couldn't help feel that Gershon would have done a much better job, although at times Shue does look very sexy.  Sevigny and Rapaport are both good young actors but neither is really given anything to do here - especially Rapaport who has bad dialogue throughout.Overall though this is watchable and isn't bad - just routine.

It delivers it's message of teenage angst in way that does not feel forced or corny. It leaves a lasting impact on the viewer and a haunting memory not soon forgotten.

However the hottest toy is already sold out weeks ago and everyone wants it. Howard finds himself in a battle against other fathers and a cruel commercial system to buy his son's love.Greatly derided by most critics on it's release, it is immediately evident to me that this film actually did have potential.  It's basic script and theme shows a real acerbic edge towards the sheer commercialism of Christmas and the pressure that adverts put on children that eventually gets put on parents, however this theme is quickly lost under childish antics and pratfalls.The action is mostly silly gags and visual stunts that aren't very funny - the absurd climax at the parade is a perfect example of this (rubbish effects and all).  It's a shame because even those of us that aren't parents can relate to the rush and pressures of Christmas, so it is a loss that the film didn't at least add this stuff thicker for adults to enjoy.  Instead, as I said, the film is more about antics than anything else, but most of these are just silly and for children.  Only the hustler Santa and his crooked elf made me laugh (`this photo was taken today' says the elf of a kidnap-victim style photo of him, a newspaper and a turboman doll!).The cast don't do anything at all.  Schwarzenegger tries hard but he is overtaken by all the mugging the script requests of him.  Sinbad is colourful and livens the film up some, but he is a one trick pony and that one trick is tired way too quickly here.  The usually reliable Hartman is a real let down and brings none of his usual wit to the film.  Wilson is OK while Lloyd shows all the subtle skill that made him such a great Skywalker (can you say sarcasm?).  Cameos from Belushi and Woodburn are good value in the one scene that I laughed at.Overall this is a weak comedy.  The adult theme underneath is good and it seems like it will be used well from the mocking start, but it's snowed under by childish gags and mugging.  The effects are poor, jokes unfunny and the cast undistinguished.

The story, animation, voices, songs, in-jokes, everything. This masterpiece is nothing short of a phenomenon. My favourite songs are Can You Feel The Love Tonight, along with the sequence that accompanies it, truly touches my heart. And the second song I love is The Circle Of Life.Other Disney flicks have tried to match the sheer brilliance of this film, but fail (LILO AND STITCH for one). But in fairness, others have succeeded, such as ALADDIN and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.I recently purchased the SE DVD just because I longed to see it once again after so many years. It should be immortalized, no doubt it already is by Disney, and children and adults alike.I won't pretend I didn't swell up with tears at certain points. That's how much I got into the story and songs. If there was ever a DVD that I'd be proud to put in my collection, THE LION KING is it.* * * * * ","genre":null},{"date":"21 December 2003","score":"","review":"  I love this film entirely.
