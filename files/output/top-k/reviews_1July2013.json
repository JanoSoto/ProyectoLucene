The film's hero is John Proctor, a sinful but respected farmer living in Salem, who comes into the story when his ex-lover accuses Proctor's wife of witchcraft.

His character has a certain charm, reluctancy and silent, brooding confidence &#x96; and all these attributes are superbly picked up Day- Lewis. Winona Ryder, playing Abigail, is just incredible in a ruthless and superbly dramatic performance.

With its reputation as the best Trek of them all, after reading the plot, you would expect bold and proud action that has a meaning to save the world. However, although we do get good action, it never seems through the camera or the characters eyes that they are fighting to save the universe and ends up just being about Picard fighting his demons and defeating the Borg for a personal achievement. In First Contact, the Enterprise crew are forced to time travel back to the mid-21st century as the Borg try to stop humans having first contact with aliens. We then find out that Captain Picard is dealing with demons once again because he was once taken in and transformed to become one of them. From here we get two groups of characters. The first are Riker and Geordi on Earth trying to make sure Zefram Cochran to fulfil his destiny and make first contact with aliens. Zefram is a cynical drunkard who is not too dissimilar to the character Dr. McCoy who was so loved by Trek fans back with the original crew. James Cromwell, portraying Cochran, brings a much needed freshness and quirkiness to the picture and gives us a very likable character. Back on the Enterprise we have an 'Alien' style survival against the Borg lead by Picard and Worf. Patrick Stewart, who of course plays Picard, once again brings his cool, commanding and cooling presence to the screen and if the state of the world really did depend on him, I'd be very happy indeed. All of these scenes have some great action and well-made chases but given its source material, feels a long way from the more human elements of the Original Crew's tenure. Sure, I love good action but it just doesn't feel like a 'Trek' film to me. Despite this, one scene at the start in which Picard disobeys orders from Starfleet is almost identical to one in Kirk and Co.'s final outing back in 1991 and feels awfully cringing.Another problem with the 'Alien' like scenes, are the aliens themselves, the Borg. Although Alice Krige puts in a creditable performance as the Borg, it is the Borg's motives which had me confused. To have power of the world, they are trying to stop human's first contact with aliens but surely, even if they stopped it then, there will be more opportunities to contact aliens. More Borg problems are that despite inhabiting their ship, the Borg will only kill the crew if they see them as a threat, and the crew will only kill the Borg if the Borg see the crew as a threat. Even when they are standing metres away form each other, they will only shoot if they sense that they are in danger. Why? I, unfortunately, cannot answer. The films visuals are the best out of all previous Trek films and so are the big-scoped space battles. More positives in the film are the dry wit in the script and great mix of seriousness and comic relief. However, this does have its downside because as the danger to Picard gets more serious, the comic relief given by James Cromwell increases which causes for a great sense of awkwardness as the two cut from one to another. Despite not being a 'Trek' film in the sense of the word, First Contact gives us an entertaining last twenty minutes, to be a decent but certainly watchable film.

Everything is filled with grace, wittiness and expensiveness. As for the songs, Little Girls is my least favorite, meaning that all the rest is a favorite of mine. For little instance, Albert Finney's performance of Maybe is holy. And with the wealthy and lively music score; it's one of the best soundtracks ever written for a movie. I was astonished by the dancing, especially &#x96; for sure &#x96; Ann Reinking's. Look at We Got Annie, ohhh, she was unforgettable delight there. This number wasn't in the original play, that this movie is based on, so I believe they made it for her to show off her unique capacities. Her dancing captured my eyes and heart, and with her beauty; she put an exclusive definition of sexy in cinema ! The cinematography created such a bright image. I recalled some of the 1950s classics, where smoothness and serene colors used to rule. Ultimately this movie's looks between a shiny morning and sparkling gem. The production was fair. I loved that mansion. Its interiors did dazzle with the huge everything. And the direction utilized it cleverly.John Huston, who Finney was slightly copying by his performance here, did wonderful in his first, very belated, musical. He felt the music and translated it into cinema. Maybe the big cadres were many, but I think that was for bragging of the production values. Cut to the problems. The casting is on their top. Yes, he performed all of his share of comedy, singing, and dancing rightly, but Finney, who was 46 year at the time, felt, with that bald head, like at least 80 ! If Aileen Quinn didn't suffer from that red wig, WE DID ! Plus she wasn't charismatic as her voice. And to make it typically worse, Finney and Quinn hadn't any chemistry together. Partly, that's why Carol Burnett stole the show as Miss Hannigan. I know, she's a storm of comedy, but &#x96; also &#x96; she hadn't so much competition around ! What didn't help developing more intensity between the 2 leads, was that script. OK, we have another Beauty and The Beast here. Though, this script solves this matter pretty damn fast. After Warbucks's refusal of Annie, and his roaring over I wanted a boy, it took that script a short dull scene at the pool to work it all out, and Abracadabra, he's all of sudden Daddy Warbucks who leaves his busy empire and takes little Annie to the movies !!! You can say that again about his love story with his secretary, who he discovers, and we discover with him, that he loves for no reason but her crooked teeth ! Add to that another no reason point, when Annie didn't feel at ease about her poor parents. It's obvious that the movie's drama wasn't taken care of like other elements such as the music.I hated a passing goof that none of the crew glimpsed  the movie takes place in 1933, however while Warbucks's helicopter was all over New York city, searching for Annie near the end, the modern skyscrapers of 1982 were inside the cadre shamelessly ! 3 points this movie has, I must refer to. Firstly, the spirit of the lavish dream; whereas Annie goes from being a dusty orphan who lives in stinking concentration camp-like to a lucky kid who has a rich loving father and mother, lives in mansions, and gets to meet the president numerously, not to mention sings with him&#x97;which's natural since it's based on Harold Gray's daily comic strip that hit popularly during the great depression days, where thousands of real-life Annies were yearning for a fate like this. Secondly, the clear nostalgia for the 1930s. You can see that through the number of Let's Go to the Movies, which wasn't in the original musical play of Annie, the long bits of Camille (1936), and the pressing presence of president Franklin D. Roosevelt's character.

This number wasn't in the original play, that this movie is based on, so I believe they made it for her to show off her unique capacities. Her dancing captured my eyes and heart, and with her beauty; she put an exclusive definition of sexy in cinema ! The cinematography created such a bright image.

I loved that mansion. Its interiors did dazzle with the huge everything. And the direction utilized it cleverly.John Huston, who Finney was slightly copying by his performance here, did wonderful in his first, very belated, musical. He felt the music and translated it into cinema. Maybe the big cadres were many, but I think that was for bragging of the production values. Cut to the problems. The casting is on their top. Yes, he performed all of his share of comedy, singing, and dancing rightly, but Finney, who was 46 year at the time, felt, with that bald head, like at least 80 ! If Aileen Quinn didn't suffer from that red wig, WE DID ! Plus she wasn't charismatic as her voice. And to make it typically worse, Finney and Quinn hadn't any chemistry together. Partly, that's why Carol Burnett stole the show as Miss Hannigan. I know, she's a storm of comedy, but &#x96; also &#x96; she hadn't so much competition around ! What didn't help developing more intensity between the 2 leads, was that script. OK, we have another Beauty and The Beast here. Though, this script solves this matter pretty damn fast. After Warbucks's refusal of Annie, and his roaring over I wanted a boy, it took that script a short dull scene at the pool to work it all out, and Abracadabra, he's all of sudden Daddy Warbucks who leaves his busy empire and takes little Annie to the movies !!! You can say that again about his love story with his secretary, who he discovers, and we discover with him, that he loves for no reason but her crooked teeth !

Secondly, the clear nostalgia for the 1930s.

Many of the crowd scenes are still incredible to watch, due to their complexity, and it's often hard to believe how much work has gone into the detailing here. You can tell that George Lucas cares most about the visuals, because he animates the smallest things, like a pear when Anakin and Padmé are having a meal together. Most importantly, Yoda is now animated and cooler than ever. Even in Episode I, a strange- looking puppet was being used. Now, however, he looks completely normal and his animated nature allows for cooler fight scenes and awesome jump shots.The acting isn't too bad overall, and Ewan McGregor is really good in this film, but he is let down by others, such as Hayden Christensen. His portrayal of Anakin in the film is so irritating that you do want him just to die as soon as possible, and you don't really care about him at all. His relationship with Padmé (who hasn't really aged since Episode I, while Anakin really has) is very creepy as well. His conversion to the dark side is also quite annoying, with the flip-out that he has after his mother's death being completely unnecessary and over the top. Her death is also really cheesy, with a complete 'head falls back suddenly' collapse.The film is, despite many dark moments, occasionally very humorous (but not C3PO's one liners), and many action sequences are also very cool.

Michael of course does not like this, and dispatches most of them in gruesome ways leading to a fiery conclusion.This one definitely the weakest of the original series, right next to 'Halloween 5 The Revenge of Michael Myers'. At least part 5 had some real connection the Myers story! After Laurie is killed, we get a bunch of newbie characters that we never really even care about. The acting is OKAY, but the characters' are written as the most irritating people in existence. I never really cared for most of their safety, except maybe Sean Patrick Thomas' character Rudy. The main girl Sara is nice enough, but she is written and acted as a complete bore. The twist of having the reality show was good though, and I give them marks for thinking outside the box.

A petty thief and prostitute for most of her life, Graham sealed her fate by taking part in a robbery that went bad and the victim ended up dead.In real life, the evidence against Graham was pretty clear; the film casts several shadows of doubt and implies that she was railroaded, an unnecessary device insofar as the truth was just as compelling, particularly the numerous last minute stays of half an hour at a time.Barbara Graham obviously was a meaty role for any actress, and it won Susan Hayward her only Oscar after laboring in Hollywood for more than twenty years. Only problem it is neither her best role nor her best performance. The whitewashing of the character of Graham weakens the film, and Robert Wise uncharacteristically lets Hayward overact all over the place; the end result is more Hollywood than San Quentin.Now, I've never thought Hayward was a great actress, but she was by no means incapable of an Oscar-worthy performance; it's just that this wasn't it. She was nominated for three Oscars for playing real-life people, and I just wish she could have won for her Lillian Roth in I'LL CRY TOMORROW or, even better, her Jane Froman in WITH A SONG IN MY HEART, which I have always thought was her best performance even though she did not do her own singing (Froman did the vocals). In fact, watching I WANT TO LIVE! the other night, it struck me that Ida Lupino would have been a much better choice for the role she was just a few months younger than Hayward and the resemblance between the two was more than a passing one, and I think Lupino had the necessary chops to play the part without the mechanics showing. When I was in acting school one of the things I heard constantly when working on scenes was STOP ACTING!, a phrase which stems from a piece of advice to young actors from the great Spencer Tracy Never let them (the audience) catch you at it. The one thing the film does have is the unbearable tension as the clock ticks away for Graham, with several last-minute stays, and the final scene in the gas chamber is more harrowing than the death chamber scene more than a generation later in DEAD MAN WALKING. DMW is a great film but the lethal injection is harder to make horrifying than the gas chamber, particularly in light of World War II.Interestingly, the two films together do make a cogent argument against the death penalty. Punishment and revenge are not the same thing, and a civilized society has to ask itself the question if we as a people put criminals to death are we not lowering ourselves to their level? I wish I liked this movie better. Wise was a great director, and Hayward worked her shapely behind off in this role. But in the end she tried too hard and for some reason Wise did not rein her in.

A petty thief and prostitute for most of her life, Graham sealed her fate by taking part in a robbery that went bad and the victim ended up dead.In real life, the evidence against Graham was pretty clear; the film casts several shadows of doubt and implies that she was railroaded, an unnecessary device insofar as the truth was just as compelling, particularly the numerous last minute stays of half an hour at a time.Barbara Graham obviously was a meaty role for any actress, and it won Susan Hayward her only Oscar after laboring in Hollywood for more than twenty years. Only problem it is neither her best role nor her best performance. The whitewashing of the character of Graham weakens the film, and Robert Wise uncharacteristically lets Hayward overact all over the place; the end result is more Hollywood than San Quentin.Now, I've never thought Hayward was a great actress, but she was by no means incapable of an Oscar-worthy performance; it's just that this wasn't it. She was nominated for three Oscars for playing real-life people, and I just wish she could have won for her Lillian Roth in I'LL CRY TOMORROW or, even better, her Jane Froman in WITH A SONG IN MY HEART, which I have always thought was her best performance even though she did not do her own singing (Froman did the vocals). In fact, watching I WANT TO LIVE! the other night, it struck me that Ida Lupino would have been a much better choice for the role she was just a few months younger than Hayward and the resemblance between the two was more than a passing one, and I think Lupino had the necessary chops to play the part without the mechanics showing. When I was in acting school one of the things I heard constantly when working on scenes was STOP ACTING!, a phrase which stems from a piece of advice to young actors from the great Spencer Tracy Never let them (the audience) catch you at it. The one thing the film does have is the unbearable tension as the clock ticks away for Graham, with several last-minute stays, and the final scene in the gas chamber is more harrowing than the death chamber scene more than a generation later in DEAD MAN WALKING. DMW is a great film but the lethal injection is harder to make horrifying than the gas chamber, particularly in light of World War II.Interestingly, the two films together do make a cogent argument against the death penalty. Punishment and revenge are not the same thing, and a civilized society has to ask itself the question if we as a people put criminals to death are we not lowering ourselves to their level? I wish I liked this movie better. Wise was a great director, and Hayward worked her shapely behind off in this role. But in the end she tried too hard and for some reason Wise did not rein her in. Hayward proved in WITH A SONG IN MY HEART that she was capable of underplaying for effect; Wise should have put that talent to better use here.

The film clearly abused the novel with humanizing the Dracula, how the Dracula feels regret when turning Mina into vampire and all other scenes. While in the novel Dracula is something a curse creature, unforgiven, cursed by God, inhumane, heartless, deserves to die, and has a childish frame of mind.2. In the novel there are no explanations about the Dracula having lovers or wives or whatever. So turning Mina into some kind of reincarnation of the passed Dracula lover is something ridiculous. And the film even worse makes the love relations between Dracula and Mina into the main topics is disgusting.3. The novel shows the very deep modesty relation between Mina and Jonathan, they very loves each other, very respecting each other, they feel their emotions each other, they show their grieves deeply if one another has the problems, and it's affecting us...REALLY. But the film turns Mina into an unfaithful wife with her desire to the Dracula and they even almost make love in Mina's desire...MY GOSH!!!!SPOILER ENDS!!Finally, i understand if a film isn't exactly words by words with the novel version, but if they changed the main topic and the heart of the novel which is the beast Dracula in to something humane Dracula, thats too much.

Oh, the lad does enjoy things like baseball, but as soon as he discovers his gift for chess, then it is a new beginning. We often see child masterminds in music and in art and in the sciences, including mathematics. For instance, didn't Mozart make his debut at age four? And what about Pascal, who wrote a treatise at age nine? Anyway, our seven year-old chess genius has a grasp of complicated moves that exceeds that of adults. Still, he is just a boy; he simply has not lived. In the film, we see clips of the great chess grandmaster, Bobby Fischer, who won the US Chess Championship at age 14. He could play (and win) many board games at once. He became official world champion in 1972 when he defeated Soviet champ Boris Spassky. After his victory, he appeared on a Bob Hope TV special. But after 1975 he became a recluse and practically disappeared from the planet. Fischer had controversial beliefs. For instance, he believed in a worldwide Jewish conspiracy, and favored the Palestinians over Israel. In any case, the film's title refers not to Bobby Fischer, but to a potential American successor, one who plays like him (like Josh). And hopefully not one who had lived such an abnormal life like Fischer.Josh Waitzkin, well-played by Max Pomeranc, a real chess player, was born with his gift, which he discovers at an early age. He enjoys going to Washington Park in NYC to play with the dregs and hustlers who hang out there. Note that one of the Russian players there once defeated Tal, who was world champ in 1960-61. The Washington Park folks play a fast game (blitz), use unorthodox moves, and intimate their opponents. Vinnie (Laurence Fishburne), a drug addict, is one of the hustlers in the park. He seems to like Josh. As he parents discover Josh's gift, they seem oblivious of what to do with it. For instance, is winning at chess the only thing in life? Eventually, Josh's sports-writer father Fred (Joe Mantegna, in a luminous performance), hires Bruce Pandolfini (Ben Kingsley) a brilliant chess-master and former national champion, to coach his son. Bruce's style, in contrast to Vinnie's, is to use the planned approach. But Bruce seems to be almost as difficult to deal with as Fischer. He says that Josh's personality is represented by the KING chess piece, and reminds Josh that Bobby Fischer held the world in contempt. Bruce wants to keep the boy away from Washington Park, which is a hindrance to his understanding of the finer points of chess even though Josh loves the place. When Bruce later tries to teach Josh the cutthroat style of chess, Josh's mother (Bonnie = Joan Allen), becomes chagrined and states, He's decent! (Translation = He does not hate his opponents.) When a patronizing teacher (Laura Linney) tries to belittle Josh's achievement &#x96; his string of victories &#x96; Fred indignantly proclaims, He's better at this than I've ever been at anything in my life. He's better at this than you'll ever be at anything. My son has a gift. He has a gift, and when you acknowledge that, then maybe we will have something to talk about.There is a point where one may ask what happens when the need to win consumes all of the fun. In the course of the movie, we learn much about tournament chess, as Josh works his way to the top. We see what happens when he begins to lose interest and sustains a series of reverses before he regains his position. In the end it comes down to the two best players &#x96; Josh and Jonathan Poe &#x96; for the junior national championship. Who will win? The movie is based upon Fred Waitzkin's autobiographical book. Our feature does not focus on any one game or on individual piece moves, so that one does not need to know how to play chess to enjoy the film.

He actually coached young Waitzkin for quite a long time. Apparently the real Pandolfini is milder and has a more easygoing style, unlike the movie's portrayal. But that's Hollywood. An error is the film was a reference to former world champion Casablanca; that grandmaster's real name was Jose Raul Capablanca (In 1921 Capablanca defeated Emanuel Lasker, who had held the world championship since 1894, when he bested Wilhelm Steinitz). Despite minor issues, the movie exudes both realism and fascination.Postscript Josh Waitzkin became an International Master at age 16.

I am prompted to write because I haven't seen this one lately but yesterday saw Tony Richardson's Hamlet starring Nicol Williamson. How it made me appreciate THIS ONE. It is SO much better. There's almost no comparison. Branagh's Hamlet has more shades of color and complexity, more depth. He's the right age, and his mother and stepfather actually look older than he, which is not the case in the Hamlet with Williamson. Horatio is the right age to be his pal in Branagh's version-- is that too much to ask, a Horatio that does not look quite a bit older than Claudius?The play is not cut to ribbons, either, which is what we find in the Nicol Williamson version of Hamlet.

His direction and writing make this film and he has certainly created the best entry in the series for these characters. The film starts off with Captain Sulu, not of the Enterprise but the Excelsior. This opening is collision-packed and it is great for George Takei to have his moment to shine in. In fact, this film really just shows off every crew-member's brilliance and they all get their moments to shine. We then find out that there is a peace summit that Kirk has to escort the Klingons to. While on this journey, the Klingons and humans have a dinner on The Enterprise that excels in being completely awkward. The film gives you a sense of admiration from both parties but a certain reluctancy to extend it into nothing more than a conversation with many many awkward silences. The Enterprise then starts attacking the Klingon ship without firing anything and this all-then results in the death of the Klingon Chancellor and the arrest and charge of Kirk and McCoy for the murder. The trial scene in which they are interrogated is extremely tense and frightening in a strange sort of way. This then sets up a brilliant Agatha Christie style investigation into who actually killed the chancellor and how the shots were fired from the Enterprise. My only complaint about the film itself is that it is way too obvious who the mole is and when the crew discover who it is, the film tries to make it a massive thing. In terms of comparison to the previous instalment, everything is better. The script is witty and the one-liners actually work. We actually get a real sense of threat here and the series best space battle that isn't too far off the quality of Star Wars (although the effects still need working on).

From a cool film opening, to its humour, likable protagonists, good special effects, a brilliant villain and an epic score. However, all of these just seem an imitation of a far superior film series Star Wars. The first entry in the Star Trek series, although had its faults, at least had its own style unlike this. This doesn't mean it isn't a bad film, however. Yet again the entire crew put in commanding performances and William's Shatner portrayal of an ageing Kirk is probably his best. The film also has better sound and visual effects and ups the suspense, most notable in the film's first and last half an hour. Ricardo Montalban puts in a performance only second in his career to 'The Naked Gun', in terms of sheer entertainment. His character, Khan, is terrifying and ruthless and Montalban adds a brilliant sophistication to his character with his charming Mexican accent. In this film, as a viewer, you get a better sense of the threat to the Enterprise crew. Despite these positives, the films middle section is painfully slow and despite having a fairly simple plot, its ending, however satisfying it may be, is awfully confusing. It is a huge disappointment that the supposed space battle is very tame and that there is no final confrontation between Kirk and Khan. Probably better than its predecessor and clever in parts, 'Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan is just an attempt at copying the style that is so loved in George Lucas' 'Star Wars'.

From a cool film opening, to its humour, likable protagonists, good special effects, a brilliant villain and an epic score. However, all of these just seem an imitation of a far superior film series Star Wars. The first entry in the Star Trek series, although had its faults, at least had its own style unlike this. This doesn't mean it isn't a bad film, however. Yet again the entire crew put in commanding performances and William's Shatner portrayal of an ageing Kirk is probably his best. The film also has better sound and visual effects and ups the suspense, most notable in the film's first and last half an hour.
