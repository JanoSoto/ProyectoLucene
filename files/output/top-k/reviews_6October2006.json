Each one of his films brings something new to the table and delves into such issues as urban\/rural conflicts, political corruption, and Japan-China relations. Red Sorghum is Zhang Yimou's first film as a director and while it may be a bit simpler than many of his later films it contains elements that almost every fan of his films will be familiar with beautiful settings, very fleshed out characters, and moments of conflict where those who possess little power are overwhelmed by larger forces. Also, Red Sorghum is Gong Li first film, and it is nice to see that even at such a young age, 21, that she already possessed on screen charisma that can really grip the viewer's heart. While not as masterful as her performances in To Live or Chen Kaige's Farewell My Concubine, her tears and iron core are still quite moving.Based on Mo Yan's novel of the same name, Red Sorghum tells the story of a young girl nicknamed Nine, she is the ninth child of her family and she was born on the ninth day of the ninth month, who was given to a leper named Big Head Li who traded a mule for her. On her trip to Big Head Li's home, while being jostled about in the sedan chair as custom would have it, Nine peeks from behind the curtains and spots one of the well-muscled sedan carriers and falls in love with him at first site. Later, After killing a would be thief and being able to see Nine for the first time, the sedan carrier, who is only referred to as my grandfather by the narrator, falls instantly in love also. On a trip back to her father's home, as custom would hold on the third day of marriage, Nine is accosted by a masked man who turns out to be the sedan carrier. There under the shadows of the sorghum they make love. While a her father's home Big Head Li is killed although no one knows who did it, so upon her return to the winery Nine inherits the place and asks the workers to stay and work for her.

De Mille having the scope of vision to do justice to a show deliberately created to be so big that one person simply can't take it all in, and the stories and subplots that abound under the biggest of the Big Tops. That said, I do have to wonder what on earth the Academy was thinking when they voted TGSOE the Oscar as Best Picture of 1952.That year saw the release of High Noon, Ivanhoe, The Quiet Man and Singin' In The Rain, any one of which could lay better claim to the title of Best Picture in terms of writing, plot and cinematography. Why did TGSOE win the Oscar? I believe it is because the film was seen as a last chance vote for De Mille; particularly ironic given that C.B. received the Thalberg that year for creating and producing consistently high-quality movies. De Mille's best work was decades behind him when he filmed the 1951 edition of the Ringling Brothers - Barnum & Bailey Circus. The subplots, purple prose and some of the situations have more in common with the silent cinema spectacles for which De Mille is justly famed than they do with the realities of running a three-ring railroad circus plus midway under canvas on the road for an 8-month season.One subplot almost derailed the production, in fact. From its beginnings, Ringling Brothers was renowned for running a totally honest show. Considering that at one point Ringling had been nicknamed 'the Sunday-School Show' for its total intolerance of grifters, pickpockets and thieves, the subplot involving a crime boss planting a team of con men on the show to run the midway's games of chance was about as welcome to the circus's management as a skunk at a picnic. There were rows between De Mille, Art Concello (Ringling's Director of Performance) and John Ringling North (the show's owner) over this subplot until C.B. convinced them he needed that plot line to set up the climactic train wreck at the end of the movie. (Ringling's management didn't like THAT much either, because RB&BB hadn't had a train wreck since 1892!) However, Ringling Brothers extended itself beyond their usual standards to accommodate the filming. Concello, a famous aerialist in his time, even gaffed The Great Sebastian's fall for De Mille. Despite the tensions engendered by the needs of two different forms of entertainment (there is a circus legend that De Mille got a royal chewing-out from Concello for moving the lighting around without asking so he could film better, thus nearly causing a trapeze artist to fall because he couldn't see his catcher), the principal photography is a marvelous chronicle of circus life in and out of the ring. The photography, in fact, is what makes The Greatest Show On Earth such an important picture. De Mille succeeded in capturing on film a way of life that even then was starting to die; John Ringling North would strike the Big Top for good midway through the 1956 season and convert his circus into an 'arena show.' Forget the corny subplots involving Brad Braden, Angel, Holly, Buttons the Clown, Klaus the elephant trainer and The Great Sebastian. Watch this movie in a documentary frame of mind and you will realize not just how important the circus used to be back before television brought the world into your living room, but the sense of wonder that has been lost from our faster-paced, wider-ranging lives. Glory in the music as well, much of it written either for the movie or the 1951 Edition. Victor Young's The Greatest Show On Earth March instantly sets the circus scene just as well as Fucik's Entry of the Gladiators ever has. Remember that all those acts are doing their thing in real time, not with the help of a green screen and CGI. Those are real people really risking their necks out there! (Oh yes and that really IS Betty Hutton working on the single bar above Ring One. She was doubled for the sequences on the flying trapeze, but she learned and performed her own routines on the single bar. There is an extant film clip of her being presented with an award from Photoplay Magazine by C.B. De Mille, who had to ride up on a camera crane to give it to her while she was rehearsing under the Big Top.) We owe the great Cecil B. De Mille many thanks for documenting The Greatest Show On Earth at its peak. I personally believe this movie should rank high on the AFI 100 Greatest Movies List. However, as I've said, the best picture of 1952 it isn't, not by a long shot.Even so, buy the DVD and go to the circus again... and again... and again! Bring the young 'uns! Bring the old folks! Come again! ","genre":null},{"date":"6 October 2006","score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" As a circus buff, I can't imagine anybody BUT Cecil B.

Considering that at one point Ringling had been nicknamed 'the Sunday-School Show' for its total intolerance of grifters, pickpockets and thieves, the subplot involving a crime boss planting a team of con men on the show to run the midway's games of chance was about as welcome to the circus's management as a skunk at a picnic. There were rows between De Mille, Art Concello (Ringling's Director of Performance) and John Ringling North (the show's owner) over this subplot until C.B. convinced them he needed that plot line to set up the climactic train wreck at the end of the movie. (Ringling's management didn't like THAT much either, because RB&BB hadn't had a train wreck since 1892!) However, Ringling Brothers extended itself beyond their usual standards to accommodate the filming. Concello, a famous aerialist in his time, even gaffed The Great Sebastian's fall for De Mille. Despite the tensions engendered by the needs of two different forms of entertainment (there is a circus legend that De Mille got a royal chewing-out from Concello for moving the lighting around without asking so he could film better, thus nearly causing a trapeze artist to fall because he couldn't see his catcher), the principal photography is a marvelous chronicle of circus life in and out of the ring. The photography, in fact, is what makes The Greatest Show On Earth such an important picture. De Mille succeeded in capturing on film a way of life that even then was starting to die; John Ringling North would strike the Big Top for good midway through the 1956 season and convert his circus into an 'arena show.' Forget the corny subplots involving Brad Braden, Angel, Holly, Buttons the Clown, Klaus the elephant trainer and The Great Sebastian. Watch this movie in a documentary frame of mind and you will realize not just how important the circus used to be back before television brought the world into your living room, but the sense of wonder that has been lost from our faster-paced, wider-ranging lives. Glory in the music as well, much of it written either for the movie or the 1951 Edition. Victor Young's The Greatest Show On Earth March instantly sets the circus scene just as well as Fucik's Entry of the Gladiators ever has. Remember that all those acts are doing their thing in real time, not with the help of a green screen and CGI. Those are real people really risking their necks out there! (Oh yes and that really IS Betty Hutton working on the single bar above Ring One. She was doubled for the sequences on the flying trapeze, but she learned and performed her own routines on the single bar. There is an extant film clip of her being presented with an award from Photoplay Magazine by C.B. De Mille, who had to ride up on a camera crane to give it to her while she was rehearsing under the Big Top.) We owe the great Cecil B.

De Mille having the scope of vision to do justice to a show deliberately created to be so big that one person simply can't take it all in, and the stories and subplots that abound under the biggest of the Big Tops. That said, I do have to wonder what on earth the Academy was thinking when they voted TGSOE the Oscar as Best Picture of 1952.That year saw the release of High Noon, Ivanhoe, The Quiet Man and Singin' In The Rain, any one of which could lay better claim to the title of Best Picture in terms of writing, plot and cinematography. Why did TGSOE win the Oscar? I believe it is because the film was seen as a last chance vote for De Mille; particularly ironic given that C.B. received the Thalberg that year for creating and producing consistently high-quality movies. De Mille's best work was decades behind him when he filmed the 1951 edition of the Ringling Brothers - Barnum & Bailey Circus. The subplots, purple prose and some of the situations have more in common with the silent cinema spectacles for which De Mille is justly famed than they do with the realities of running a three-ring railroad circus plus midway under canvas on the road for an 8-month season.One subplot almost derailed the production, in fact.

Science fiction films were always thought to be 'B' movies, whereas even a bad Western would never be thought of as a 'B' film. This was a time when the world was changing faster than many people could cope with, and there was a sense that the world was in great danger. The advent of the nuclear bomb had created words that people did not know the meaning of, but of which they were terrified. Radiation, mutation, atomic pile, thermonuclear weapon. People were realizing that nuclear meant more than just bombs, that something which you could not see, smell, hear, or taste could kill in a matter of seconds, even though it might take months to die.In this setting, a movie about mutated ants capable of destroying the world was very powerful. Because ants are a hive creature, they seem somehow different from most insects. And they have fascinated people for years, with their orderly nests. It was easy to believe that a colony in the area where the first atomic bomb was exploded could have been affected by the lingering radiation, and that the effect was giantism. And ants are the perfect monster, being capable of huge feats of strength for their size, with terrible mandibles ready to rend and tear, and packing a horrible stinger, which many people can remember hurting them.'Them' does an excellent job of building the suspense, with mysterious happenings in otherwise normal settings. We see two future stars, James Arness and James Whitmore carrying this film with excellent acting. They are supported with a very believable performance by Joan Weldon, in the nearly unheard (at that time)of role of woman scientist. She is rendered authenticity by the character of her father, the nations leading myrmecologist. Myrma what? This film actually attempts to be scientific in its depiction of ants, pointing out that they have the strength for their size equivalent to a human having the strength of 12 men.Edmund Gwenn makes a memorable portrayal of the elderly scientist, tops in his field, but facing something completely new, like talking on a radio. His performance as the slightly absent minded senior researcher brings several moments of laughter to an otherwise very serious film. He is not the only one we can laugh at, for Fess Parker appears in one of his earliest roles, playing the part of someone who is being held against his will because he saw something he can not believe.This film is, in my opinion, one of the all time classics of science fiction, superbly made, well written, photographed carefully, and with quality acting. It does not need to rely on special effects, trick photography, or script non sequiturs. I think that it is likely to outlast most of that decades prolific output of science fiction, simply because it was never a 'B' movie.

Six hundred and forty BJs in five days. I'm tired. (The camera lingers on her triumphant expression so we can share her joy in humiliating her superiors.) It's very slickly done. Her life is filled with travails. I mean, out of work, three fatherless children, rear ended by some rich dope in a Mercedes. Fortunately there's a guy.Therein is an illustration of a slight problem. These folks look real enough on the surface but they're actually ringers. Erin, despite her cutting sarcasm, doesn't really speak much like a redneck and neither do the other people of her class. Nobody smokes. (Might drive away the intended audience.) The guy she falls in with is introduced as some kind of biker\/doper wearing ragged jeans, a faded bandanna wrapped around his head, a beard, and a pony tale -- revving up his chopper after he moves in next door. But it's all a front. The bandanna is soon dropped and we get to know him for the quiet, quietly reassuring, supportive, child-loving Mensch that he truly is. When the trappings of bikerhood are gone -- and we never see the bike again -- he sits there in silence while Erin pours out her woes and, what with his neat beard, his reading glasses and his serenity and his slight, tolerant smile, he is more a Jewish psychotherapist than a biker.Of course he has to pack up and leave her at some point otherwise the movie would be absent one cliché. They're both sad about the split, and it doesn't last that long, but, as he explains it, he never sees her anymore because she's always working late. He does everything but say, You're already married -- to your job. There's never a moment's doubt about who is good and who is bad in a movie like this. Erin is authentic and good, like the earth before it was poisoned by PG&E. The fraudulent biker is also good. We know it right away, although she doesn't. Erin's boss, Finney, is good too, although a little gruff at times, kind of like Lou Grant. The victims of the lethal chromium isotope are all good too. None of them is in it for the money. The new partners that Finney acquires to help him cover his expenses are on the right side but they're pretentious. They dress in expensive tailored clothing and are aghast when Erin swears. The poor woman who represents the new partners looks as if she took baths in a mild solution of hydrochloric acid. There is no life either in her or on her. Her hair is pulled back severely, she wears a suit and tie, and her makeup gives her a cadaverous glow.It's not a thoughtful film by any measure, but it does get the job done. Goliath is vanquished by David and we applaud as the end credits roll. The performances are adequate -- no better than that, but no worse either. Sometimes the film borrows entire modules from other successful movies. The resentment of the antagonistic informant who answers the door when the investigator knocks. (Verdict, All the President's Men.) The heroine caught up in the cause that threatens her love life. (Silkwood, Norma Rae.) The script makes fun of a jealous fat woman. (Kiss my ***, Krispy Kreme.) It's that kind of movie.

Selznick,   cough), while also showing too the joys of working in the business. But   it's a business at its most booming time, coming out of the 40s where   the producer was king, and the director had to vie for room at times to   really get his vision in. Here the producer Jonathan Shields is played   by Kirk Douglas as someone with big ideas at first- he even has an idea   to help make a scary movie about cats even more frightening by not   showing the cats (echoes of Val Lewton). Soon he rises the ranks and   becomes big enough to really call the shots all he wants, but it also   gets in the way of personal relationships, severs ties, and sometimes   even makes him out to be monstrous (there's one shot I remember all the   time where Douglas, in a big fit of anger against Lana Turner's   character, seems like he's a whole foot taller with the ego almost   manifested). The narrative of the film is a retelling by people who   knew him, a sexy but soon disillusioned actress, a director who once   worked with Shields but then got cut off from him, and a writer played   by Dick Powell.    Rashomon or Citizen Kane it is not in trying to reveal more grandiose   and amazing things about human nature, but rather a supreme rumination   on the good times and the bad times, possibly more of the latter.   What's great about Douglas's portrayal is that through the stories from   the three ex-friends and co-workers and lovers, he becomes a very   well-rounded character. At the core, of course, is the producer who at   the time had as more creative say than anyone else on the set. This   brings some of the great scenes ever shown about movie-making, such as   the moment when Amiel, the director, tries to put Jonathan in his   place about how a scene should be shot, in order to direct a picture   you need humility. Another comes with the moment when Jonathan and his   soon to be 'asistant to the producer' has to object out of just being   stunned. But more than Douglas, it's also tremendous, memorable screen   time for Lana Turner, perhaps in her most successful performance in   just sheer acting terms (not necessarily just in presence or style like   in other pictures), and for Dick Powell, who with this and Murder My   Sweet has two defining roles outside of his usual niche.    With many sweet camera moves, a script that crackles with the kind of   scenes and dialog that makes one wish for the glory times of   Hollywood's Golden Age, and at least four or five really excellent   performances, The Bad and the Beautiful might not be as astounding and   near-perfect as 8 1\/2 or as funny as Bowfinger, but it ranks up there   with the best movies about movie-making, and can make for some fine   entertainment even for those who aren't really interested in how movies   are made.

Harry Potter, for those who have been living under a rock for ten years, is a highly successful series of novels for children. The protagonist, Harry, is a neglected eleven-year-old schoolboy in England who learns he is not a regular boy at all. In fact Harry Potter is a wizard. As if that wasn't shocking enough to learn on your eleventh birthday, Harry also discovers that he is not alone, there is a large hidden community of wizardry and magic that Harry will come to live in. The movie series created out of the novels, gives a visual touch to the bestselling books. Children who imagined what Harry's world looked like are given a stunning digital image of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Children have reacted to the Harry Potter series much like the children of the late seventies to early eighties reacted to Star Wars. Star Wars created a whole universe of aliens and spacecraft, which turned into a billion dollar empire of merchandise and licensing rights. Children fell in love with the Star Wars characters; toys and any other merchandise from that series were astonishingly successful. Just as Star Wars was its own universe of marketability, so is the young wizard's Harry Potter's world. Harry lives in England, but attends a secret wizardry school. He requires a magic wand, a robe, a cauldron, magic potions, a flying broom, and many schoolbooks. Not surprisingly, children in the real world can find all of these items as toys in their local toy store, without the magical powers of course. But just because Harry Potter is marketable is not why he is successful.Harry Potter's story speaks to the fantasies of all little children, He comes from a seemingly horrendous lifestyle to find out he is famous and powerful. Harry's parents died when he was an infant, his aunt and uncle raised him. They neglected him and only focused on their son Dudley, who was an overweight bully who only gained entertainment from torturing Harry. Harry was forced to live in a closet under the stairs. Harry was very alone. However, Harry soon gets what every child wants, after he discovers the truth of his past, he learns he is actually rich but didn't know it, and he attends school and finds friends and a group of people who love him. The movie has many lessons for young children. It preaches equality, acceptance, hard work, and stresses the importance of family. Harry must constantly study for his classes, which get increasingly harder. He befriends a boy who is from a large poor Irish wizard family, Ron Weasley, even though the rest of the community seems to mock the Weasley family. He also befriends a nerdy, brainy girl, Hermione Granger. But the biggest social moral running through the entire series is that of accepting others who maybe different. The wizarding world is locked in a hot debate over the education of witches and wizards. Magic skills are passed down from generation to generation, Harry's parents where very famous wizards who were murdered. Some witches and wizards are not the offspring of other magic folk. The magical children of wizards are described as pureblooded. Many in the wizarding world wish to discriminate against those of who are not pure blood. They are referred to as mudbloods, a derogatory term. Harry finds himself defending the mudblood children, namely his friend Hermione. Harry Potter does not only appeal to one gender. Even though the main character is a boy, it has been found that girls enjoy the series just as much if not more than boys. The issues Harry faces are universal to childhood. He longs for friendship and family and gets all of his wishes. A pure fantasy for many children, which is why they are so attracted to it. Harry defeats the bully; he becomes successful at sports, battles evil, and becomes a popular hero among his peers. Harry Potter is also a classic fantasy for children. Harry Potter is destined to battle the most evil wizard who ever lived; Lord Voldemort. Voldemort is responsible for the death of Harry's parents, and the deaths of many other good witches and wizards. Like with many children's films and stories, good and evil are clearly defined. Children can clearly rout for good to triumph evil. The film is not without its critics. Some in the Christian community do not like the series because to seems to promote an anti-Christian life-style. Some Christians object to teaching children about fantasy magic, paganism, and a society that does not worship Jesus. Even though in the movie the characters all celebrate Christmas. Overall I give the film an A-; there is not much in this film to be fearful of from the perspective of a parent. There is some fantasy violence, limited to magic beams emanating from wands. Children, can reenact the events in the film without any harm to anyone. The movie encourages children to work hard, play sports, and fight for equality. Children obviously love this series as it has been turned into a huge market empire. I would recommend it myself for anyone with children.

Harry Potter, for those who have been living under a rock for ten years, is a highly successful series of novels for children. The protagonist, Harry, is a neglected eleven-year-old schoolboy in England who learns he is not a regular boy at all. In fact Harry Potter is a wizard. As if that wasn't shocking enough to learn on your eleventh birthday, Harry also discovers that he is not alone, there is a large hidden community of wizardry and magic that Harry will come to live in. The movie series created out of the novels, gives a visual touch to the bestselling books. Children who imagined what Harry's world looked like are given a stunning digital image of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Children have reacted to the Harry Potter series much like the children of the late seventies to early eighties reacted to Star Wars. Star Wars created a whole universe of aliens and spacecraft, which turned into a billion dollar empire of merchandise and licensing rights. Children fell in love with the Star Wars characters; toys and any other merchandise from that series were astonishingly successful. Just as Star Wars was its own universe of marketability, so is the young wizard's Harry Potter's world. Harry lives in England, but attends a secret wizardry school.

In cinematic terms it is a portmanteau film in that it consists of several different stories that are all tied together by one event and one theme. The event here is a car accident which we witness at the start of the film, and the theme present throughout the film is that of love.The three stories tell of a youth's love for his brother's wife, a woman's love of herself (although I think anyone would be sympathetic of her situation), and a man's love for his daughter. Though there are many more examples of love within each story.What is original, however, is the way in which the theme of love also revolves around dogs, and the love of dogs and hate of dogs ties the story together as much as the characters' love and hate for each other.The filmography is also very impressive. The chase scene which causes the accident is fast and tense, on numerous occasions the tension becomes quite nerve-racking, and the second story in the film is actually quite scary rather like a horror film.This film is very good, not amazing, but it is clever, and the acting is superb. It has also been criticised for being too long. This, of course, is such a subjective comment because a long film is only long if it feels long to the viewer - and in some cases, as with me and Nirgendwo in Afrika, you don't want a long film to end.Unfortunately, with this film, I did look at the time, and it could have done with being slightly shorter. However, it did allow director Alejandro González Iñárritu to later direct the excellent American funded film 21 Grams, and Amores Perros is still a film well worth watching; a film which gives an insight into life and class in Mexico City today.

So when I saw this in the shops for £5 I thought I would buy it as I have been meaning to watch it again for years.Sometimes when you watch a film from the early 90's you realise how dated films can get - not this film. The plight of Andrew Beckett is as true today as it was 13 years ago. Like some other users have commented, its rare to agree with Oscar but on this occasion the award could not have gone to any other than Tom Hanks. The physical change he made to play the character was visually amazing, but the emotion he put in to this part was so moving and utterly fantastic that he should have won every award possible. I cried buckets all the way through the film as I was so moved by his performance.I think one of the most poignant parts of the film is when Andrew is on the stand in court and Mary Steenburgen's character questions his lesions saying the one he claims to have on his face is barely visible so how can anyone believe that he had visible ones on his face so people knew he had AIDS? Then Denzel Wahington asks if he has any on his body LIKE the ones on his face and he says he has, on his torso. Then he opens his shirt and you the huge red lesions on his chest and everyone in court gasps. It shows the audience how much AIDS ravages the body, and how it would have been blatantly obvious to someone who had had experience with AIDS before as the law company had, that Andrew had AIDS. Its also a very moving, upsetting scene as Tom Hanks plays this character so well you genuinely care about him.Not to be overlooked in this film are Antonio Banderas and Denzel Washington. Denzel Washington shows the irony of a black person being a bigot perfectly (this was an ingenious piece of casting showing that even people who face bigots every day can be ignorant towards AIDS) and his transformation of character in the film as he gets to know Andy and his family is again, moving. I think the scene where he sees Andy dancing to the opera and narrating what is happening is a turning point for him when he realises Andy is just a normal person with the same feelings and emotions as everyone else. Antonio Banderas is also very convincing as Tom's lover - you believe them as a couple which can be rare when Hollywood take on homosexuality - they tend to camp it up a little bit which is certainly not the case with this movie.All in all, I defy anyone to not be moved by this movie. Not only is it a great movie but it also carries a very important message about the danger and ignorance surrounding AIDS. I would recommend this to anyone and it is certainly in my Top 10 films of all time.

Such is the case with the more well-known Eraserhead, Lost Highway, Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive, all directed by David Lynch.This film could not be more different. Instead of complexity, there is simplicity; instead of delving into the depths of human depravity, this one soars to the stars as two men try to come to an understanding; instead of moral nihilism and isolation, there is affirmation of the very human need to communicate with one another as we all partake of life's journey.Other directors would &#150; or could -- have turned this film into a tearjerker. In the hands of Lynch, however, this is a straight story, told simply, a short episodic road movie with a difference in this case, the true story of an old man who uses a ride-on lawn mower to drive hundreds of miles to see his sick brother. There are none of Lynch's usual techniques of flash forwards or backwards, out of sync scenes, dark corridors or rooms, discordant music or long, inexplicable silences or looks.This is a movie you should see, and I don't say that lightly, because there are four scenes that stand out. The first is when old Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) stops for the night and is joined by a girl hitchhiker; during the course of their conversation, Alvin deftly shows her the error of her ways. A second scene is when Alvin pauses to listen to a frenetic woman (Barbara Robertson) who's just smashed into a deer on the road and killed it; Alvin's face is a study as she rants and raves about always hitting deers on that road, a road she must use every day. A third, and very powerful one, is when Alvin has a beer, for the first time in many years, and recounts a traumatic war experience with another veteran; Farnsworth was always a good actor, but here, he just shines. The final scene is when Alvin meets his estranged brother, Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton &#150; in what must be Stanton's shortest film appearance), and the camera stays on the latter most of the time, as Alvin advances. Hardly a word is spoken, as Stanton's facial expressions do most of the 'talking', from rejection to puzzlement to final acceptance.The supporting cast is uniformly down-to-earth and low-key, as befitting a story set in rural America, and the camera lovingly takes in the beauty of nature without overdoing it, too. Farnsworth carries the movie, of course, and it's a shame he didn't get many awards for it; it was arguably his finest performance before his tragic death in 2000.

You either find the idea of a man fighting a cow funny, or you don't. For this reason, Kung Pow will be absolutely polarizing - everyone's definition of what's funny is different, and if you're not into the kind of comedies where a guy dodges milk, you just won't like this. In my opinion Kung Pow is a masterpiece of stupid humour, and it has been unjustly panned by just about everyone. That this film has a score in the low 5's on IMDb.com and only a disastrous 8% on rottentomatoes.com says more about the critics than it does about the movie. I can't believe that someone didn't find this movie at least a little bit funny. This is a relentless comedy that does what all good comedies should sacrifices script, story and acting for the sake of being funny. And it's hilarious, from the deliberately bad dubbing, to the one-boobed chick, to Wimp Lo and his squeaky shoes, this is dumb humour at its very finest. The cow vs. Steve fight, which brilliantly spoofs The Matrix, is classic. Unbelievable.This is by far one of the most spot-on genre spoofs ever, but to appreciate it you must, of course, have watched the kind of stuff it parodies. If you're familiar with overdubbed Japanese schlock the likes of Time of the Apes or Fugitive Alien, the film becomes even funnier. Having a dog's dubbing out of sync is pure genius.Steve Oedekerk has a great ability to make you laugh without trying too hard. This movie is like a longer and more Japanese version of Thumb Wars, a short film I loved to death (I escaped somehow. Let's go! Priceless!). If you didn't enjoy this movie I doubt that you have a sense of humour and you should stop watching comedies. As for stuck-up critics, they can keep their Duck Soups while dissing the Farrelly brothers, Sandler and Carrey, this is a movie for us real people. Watch it!
