Scott was approached for a part in this film and shown the script, he exclaimed The language is terrible. I disagree. The language is real. The dialog is true-to-life. We don't, or, very rarely, at least, always say the right thing, and we often repeat ourselves and say stupid, pointless things when making a point or being in a situation we can't control. Contrary to what you might think, this doesn't mean that the dialog is tedious. It may take some getting used to, but you realize that it is much better than typical Hollywood dialog... because words don't convey our emotions the same way body-language and behavior does. Writer\/director Paul Thomas Anderson obviously knew that, and used it in this film. I haven't seen any of his other work, but I will. Now, this film is character-driven, and that is its biggest strength, and its main reason for failing in some parts. It's a long film, but it's not overlong(maybe a little in the end, but the first two hours are hardly ever boring). It's a film with non-Hollywood dialog, but this is just something to get used to. The problem lies undeniably in the character-driven nature of the film. Some big films have many, many characters. This one, however, has many, many main characters. This means that there are about 15 people that you have to remember, learn of, and follow throughout the three-hour run-time of this film. This means that you probably won't be able to pick up everything on the first viewing, and, more importantly, there will most likely be at least one character that you dislike, maybe even strongly. This makes every scene with them hard to sit through, and their very presence in the movie can make you annoyed with it. For me, it was Jim Kurring. He was just so pitifully annoying and unbearable. He can't tolerate 'bad language', he has the most annoying blind faith, and he just seems generally retarded. What's worse is his narration and his lack of charm or charisma. He's the guy you avoid in real life, but act nice around because you don't want him to know how badly you hate him. The film has some very heavy-handed symbolism and some seemingly pointless scenes, that could easily have been written out or cut with no real effect on the film. I enjoyed the first two thirds considerably more than the last. The scenes near the end... I won't put what happens here, but it just seemed pointless and stupid. The film didn't seem to have a real ending... nothing is really resolved. No questions answered, no solutions given. It's basically just a story about all of these people, and that's it. I don't know if I expected the ending of the film to hold some major surprise(well, that it did, I admit) or an explanation, but it just seemed kind of pointless in the end. But it did happen. Yes, but why? Are we supposed to take some moral lesson out of all of this, or is it just a study of different persons and strange coincidences? What makes a magnificent drama, I think, is if it offers a commentary on something that we all know, or pushes through an important point... One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest has the beautiful message of freedom and fighting for it, Citizen Kane shows how important love is to any man... but what does this movie show? What message is it trying to convey? I can't seem to pin-point it. Maybe I need to think more about the film... maybe there is none. That doesn't make it a bad drama, but it prevents it from being a truly remarkable one, I think. The plot is very good and well-written. The pacing is good, at least for the first two hours... after that, it seemed to slide a little downwards. The acting is flawless. Absolutely flawless. From the biggest star to the least seen extra... not one performance was unsatisfactory. Not even the child actors. The characters are well-written and credible. All in all, a very good drama, but not a perfect one and not as impressive as some shorter films.

Well, it had quite a reputation to live up to there, and I can safely say it lived up to it.

It combines its assortment of creepy and fantastical elements in a way that steers clear of the run-of-the-mill trippy and focuses instead on capturing the actual feel of a string of nightmares. As our protagonist 'Henry' drifts in and out of sleep, he experiences a series of horrific visions which presumably embody his waking fears and concerns. But just what exactly are these fears and concerns? Is it death he's so afraid of, or just fatherhood? And just where in this film do the nightmares stop and reality begin? These are all questions which arise throughout the picture and, as we've long since come to expect with the wily David Lynch, go completely unanswered. As per usual it's up to us, the plucky viewers, to draw our own conclusions.

What makes it so effective comes largely down to its meticulous scenery and camera-work &#150; a slick combination of b\/w shooting and murky, run-down interior settings that produce a world so bleak and colourless that escape and revival seem totally impossible. Furthermore, Henry's stunted interaction with the rest of the cast can't help but drag you even closer in. Often when they're looking at him, thanks to the positioning of camera angles, they appear to be staring directly at the viewer, or just past them, grinning menacingly or chanting ominous phrases like In Heaven, everything is fine. We may never fully understand Henry as a character, but thanks to these technical aspects we're almost forced to feel an affinity with him.If you haven't yet seen 'Eraserhead', and think you can handle the unease and grotesquery, then I'd strongly recommend it. It's one of those films that you may not even necessarily like as such, but still have to acknowledge what a great piece of craftsmanship it is in a league of its own &#150; a technical masterpiece that makes the most of its budget and limitations, generating exactly the unsettling atmosphere it aims for, and one of the most unique and challenging viewing experiences I've ever come across.

It lived up to it and then some.'Eraserhead' isn't merely weird &#150; it's also chilling, ominous, dark, sinister and certainly not for the squeamish&#133;or at least anyone likely to be intimidated by the sight of miniature roast chickens that writhe and bleed, women with monstrously puffy cheeks, overgrown worms, umbilical cords, dodgy pencil factories, and 'premature babies' that come up in boils and resemble a misshapen hybrid of a rubbery human embryo and ET. It combines its assortment of creepy and fantastical elements in a way that steers clear of the run-of-the-mill trippy and focuses instead on capturing the actual feel of a string of nightmares. As our protagonist 'Henry' drifts in and out of sleep, he experiences a series of horrific visions which presumably embody his waking fears and concerns. But just what exactly are these fears and concerns? Is it death he's so afraid of, or just fatherhood? And just where in this film do the nightmares stop and reality begin? These are all questions which arise throughout the picture and, as we've long since come to expect with the wily David Lynch, go completely unanswered. As per usual it's up to us, the plucky viewers, to draw our own conclusions. I have my theories on a lot of it, but there's probably an infinite number of interpretations out there somewhere.Whatever you choose to make of it in the end, it can't be denied that 'Eraserhead' is a brilliantly-made film, and it's no surprise to me that it found its cult appreciation soon enough &#150; even the more intense moments where the imagery completely repulsed me, I found it impossible to turn away. What makes it so effective comes largely down to its meticulous scenery and camera-work &#150; a slick combination of b\/w shooting and murky, run-down interior settings that produce a world so bleak and colourless that escape and revival seem totally impossible. Furthermore, Henry's stunted interaction with the rest of the cast can't help but drag you even closer in. Often when they're looking at him, thanks to the positioning of camera angles, they appear to be staring directly at the viewer, or just past them, grinning menacingly or chanting ominous phrases like In Heaven, everything is fine. We may never fully understand Henry as a character, but thanks to these technical aspects we're almost forced to feel an affinity with him.If you haven't yet seen 'Eraserhead', and think you can handle the unease and grotesquery, then I'd strongly recommend it. It's one of those films that you may not even necessarily like as such, but still have to acknowledge what a great piece of craftsmanship it is in a league of its own &#150; a technical masterpiece that makes the most of its budget and limitations, generating exactly the unsettling atmosphere it aims for, and one of the most unique and challenging viewing experiences I've ever come across. What are the odds that you'll ever see another movie even remotely like this one?

Granted, I haven't seen that much of them, but that's not the point. I'm not a big fan of him, but I must admit, he made a pretty funny film here. From what I understand, this is pretty much the only real movie he's done(everything else he's done is animated), and considering that, he does a pretty good job. However, too often the humor goes too low, and Judge reveals what I suppose is his strong hatred against certain typical types of people(high-level executives, popular cafeteria workers, etc.) by overusing them to the extreme. There's a scene where one such character appears out of nowhere and does something out of character for no actual reason. Maybe it's Judge trying to get a cheap laugh out of the audience, but more likely, it's him expressing how much he hates these people. I guess he worked places like that when he was younger, and wanted to lash back. Then there's there occasional out-of-the-blue low-brow joke and\/or reference to Beavis and Butthead... it just takes away from the otherwise great film, and it's a damn shame. The plot is very good. A disillusioned and worn out office desk-job worker gets tired of his work, and decides to stop putting any effort into it. What happens surprises him... he gets promoted. His two best friends and co-workers get fired, though. So they decide to get back at the company, through a carefully designed virus that will steal so little money at a time from the company that it won't get picked up on. The pacing is pretty good, but some jokes and gags drag along... the very first joke of the film lasts about three minutes of the film(that's what it felt like, anyway). The film lacks the feeling of progression of the plot that most films have(and need). The pacing is all laid-back and slow, which has you feeling that nothing really happens in the film, leaving you just waiting(and hoping) for the next good joke or gag. The acting is good. The characters are for the most part well-written and credible, but some are like aforementioned lashes at certain people by director\/writer Mike Judge. The humor is often very good(the many stabs at Windows 95 are great, and often accurate) but there are many things that just seem thrown in. Several characters have one or two lines but no actual effect on the plot, and could easily have been written out. Many of the characters are clichés and stereotypes, but in some cases they are accurate representations of the real thing, so it's acceptable. Two of the best examples of this are Lumbergh, the executive, and Milton, the paranoid psychotic worker. I really want to believe that there doesn't exist people like that out there, but I can't claim that to be true. Something I was a little disappointed in was the almost criminal under-use of John C. McGinley... he was great for every second he was on-screen, as always. Part of the reason for watching the film was that he's in it, actually. Same thing goes for Diedrich Bader... this guy is hilarious in the Drew Carey series, but here he only gets a few good lines. The cinematography isn't great, but it has its moments. One thing that is brilliant is the way the virus-installing scene plays out almost like a professional bank-robbery; in constant slow-motion, the guys looking around, checking for witnesses, giving each other a few knowing looks and the attempted slickness of them passing the disk... pure genius. Definitely worth watching, but not necessarily one you want to go out of your way to see or own. Unless you love Mike Judge and\/or Beavis and Butthead-humor. If that's the case, you wouldn't want to miss this for the world. A good attempt by Judge, but his inexperience shows.

I always enjoyed the action sequences and the great one liners delivered by Jack Burton (Brilliantly played by Kurt Russell. And what really sets this movie apart from more recent films is it's engaging story and its great characters.The story is simple and as old as any story that involves myth, magic and heroes. Of Good vs Evil. We have our hero (Jack Burton) truck driver by profession, who believes himself to be worldly and wise as though there is nothing he hasn't seen or done. As you see in the opening sequences, he thinks of himself as a philosopher of life and holds all its mysteries in the palm of his hands.After a night of drinking, gambling and good old fashioned male bonding.By morning to the annoyance of his new friends Jack finds himself the richer man. Yet Wang, an old friend of our philosophizing hero, convinces Jack to give him a chance at double or nothing. Of course Jack doubles his money. Sadly Wang can not afford to pay him at the moment but he can after he picks his girl up from the airport. Escorting his good friend Wang (played perfectly by Dennis Dun) to the airport. Where Wang will collect the girl and Burton will collect the cash owed to him. However our two heroes find themselves being swept up in the Chinese underworld after the kidnapping of Miao Yin (Wang's fiancée). Like any good story we need the princess to be kidnapped.Together Burton and Wang must battle against gangs of knife wielding butchers(or Chinese gangs) cray guys in straw hats,demons and a ghostly apparition named David Lo Pan to rescue the girl and restore all that was good. The story is simple but as the story unfolds you find yourself being swept away with the two heroes as the sequences flow rapidly, giving you a sense of breathlessness and given no time to really think about what has happened. You find yourself engrossed in the ride and the characters.The duologue is rather cheesy and corny but that is what makes the film so great. It is meant to be taken lightly and with a sense of humor. You can not, not laugh at Russell, who you can see is way out of his element as he understand nothing going on around him dispelling his seen and done it all brashnessI think that was Carpenter's want, for the viewer to relate to Burton and see the story through him and he achieved it wonderfully well, I feel. Jack (Russell, couldn't resist) is along the ride with you.The action is fast paced, and the fight sequences are well choreographed. The music fits flawless and perfectly with the story and at no time do you feel as though it intrudes upon the movie, which to me is a sign that the score was well handled.

Sadly Wang can not afford to pay him at the moment but he can after he picks his girl up from the airport. Escorting his good friend Wang (played perfectly by Dennis Dun) to the airport.

However our two heroes find themselves being swept up in the Chinese underworld after the kidnapping of Miao Yin (Wang's fiancée). Like any good story we need the princess to be kidnapped.Together Burton and Wang must battle against gangs of knife wielding butchers(or Chinese gangs) cray guys in straw hats,demons and a ghostly apparition named David Lo Pan to rescue the girl and restore all that was good. The story is simple but as the story unfolds you find yourself being swept away with the two heroes as the sequences flow rapidly, giving you a sense of breathlessness and given no time to really think about what has happened. You find yourself engrossed in the ride and the characters.The duologue is rather cheesy and corny but that is what makes the film so great. It is meant to be taken lightly and with a sense of humor. You can not, not laugh at Russell, who you can see is way out of his element as he understand nothing going on around him dispelling his seen and done it all brashnessI think that was Carpenter's want, for the viewer to relate to Burton and see the story through him and he achieved it wonderfully well, I feel. Jack (Russell, couldn't resist) is along the ride with you.The action is fast paced, and the fight sequences are well choreographed. The music fits flawless and perfectly with the story and at no time do you feel as though it intrudes upon the movie, which to me is a sign that the score was well handled.

Turns out after watching it, I was left with a new question Why was it ever called a masterpiece.The premise of the movie seems simple enough; a futuristic world where android technology has evolved to the point where they can simulate love...almost. A company manufactures a robot boy (mecha as they call it) and the story centers around one family that purchases it. So a person would naturally assume that the movie would be about the relationship between the mother and the mecha, or how the mecha wants to be loved, or a million and a half other artificial intelligence themes examined in films from Blade Runner to I, Robot. I don't think anyone expected the film to involve the mecha being hunted down in the woods with a robo-prostitute, or a white trash robot killing jerk fair, or a futile and boring quest for a blue fairy, or aliens for crying out loud. I have no idea how all those things occurred together in that last sentence, let alone a big Hollywood movie. Wasn't there someone anywhere during the filming who recognized the utter stupidity of it all. Couldn't one extra, actor, or stagehand tug on Spielberg's sleeve and tell him, Uh...is this serious; is this the movie you wanted to make?If the movie had been about just the human\/ A.I. relationship with the family, the movie would have merely been bland and like hundreds of other films. But to lead the audience on a two and a half hour adventure that hops from idiotic premise to idiotic premise is just terrible.

I've always enjoyed Robert Redford more as a director than an actor, and when this movie came out, I remembered being very dubious about seeing it. (Word of mouth at the time was pretty amazing, though, and that's what prompted me to get over it.) But once seen (and re-seen several times), I have made a point of catching all of Redford's directorial efforts and I'm rarely disappointed.I won't rehash the plot, others have done a good job of that, but I will say that this is much more a character study of a family than it is plot-driven. So many character studies are somewhat contrived (Rosebud anyone?*), but this felt so *real*, real family dynamics, real behaviors, real reactions and interactions. And the simplest subtlest scenes tell most of the story. For example, pay attention to a scene early in the movie between the son, Conrad, and his mother in the upstairs hallway. The attention to detail is stunning, and yet barely noticeable unless you're looking for it. All you know is that you have suddenly grasped a whole new level of understanding about these characters. Mary Tyler Moore is, if you'll forgive the cliché, a revelation. Especially for those of us who grew up with her sitcoms.That said, as the plot does unwind through the experiences of each family member, it does ultimately pack a pretty hefty emotional wallop, as in the kind you thought you should have seen coming, and didn't. It still gets me every time.This movie doesn't get nearly the attention as a classic that it deserves. See it and I'd guarantee you'd help change that.* And for you Welles fans out there, no offense, I do appreciate that Citizen Kane represented a whole new way to make a movie and respect Orson Welles' presence in the canon of breakthrough\/visionary movie makers.

But once seen (and re-seen several times), I have made a point of catching all of Redford's directorial efforts and I'm rarely disappointed.I won't rehash the plot, others have done a good job of that, but I will say that this is much more a character study of a family than it is plot-driven. So many character studies are somewhat contrived (Rosebud anyone?*), but this felt so *real*, real family dynamics, real behaviors, real reactions and interactions. And the simplest subtlest scenes tell most of the story. For example, pay attention to a scene early in the movie between the son, Conrad, and his mother in the upstairs hallway. The attention to detail is stunning, and yet barely noticeable unless you're looking for it. All you know is that you have suddenly grasped a whole new level of understanding about these characters. Mary Tyler Moore is, if you'll forgive the cliché, a revelation. Especially for those of us who grew up with her sitcoms.That said, as the plot does unwind through the experiences of each family member, it does ultimately pack a pretty hefty emotional wallop, as in the kind you thought you should have seen coming, and didn't. It still gets me every time.This movie doesn't get nearly the attention as a classic that it deserves. See it and I'd guarantee you'd help change that.* And for you Welles fans out there, no offense, I do appreciate that Citizen Kane represented a whole new way to make a movie and respect Orson Welles' presence in the canon of breakthrough\/visionary movie makers.

Paul Edgecomb is one of the guys who works at the prison. One day a big man named John Coffey come to the prison. He has been convicted for the murder of two young girls in a nearby village. But his personality is far from a cold-blooded killer. Edgecomb gradually begins to warm to Coffey and begins research as to where he came from and considers the fact that maybe he didn't commit this terrible crime at all, especially when he begins to see the miracles which emanate from Coffey's vicinity. Paul Edgecomb is the first main character of the film. He's called boss by his partners and he's a very self-controlled and sympathetic man. He has a serious urinary infection and hasn't had the courage to go and talk with a doctor. Maybe he's afraid of hearing that it's incurable. John Coffey is the second main-character. Even though he is convicted for murder he seems to be a very calm and peaceful person. He has magical powers and his actions are synonymous with Jesus. Percy is the evil man in this movie. Actually he's one of the prison-guards but he's an immature and smug stripling. It's like he doesn't care for anyone and he does everything to satisfy himself. I think all movies are filled with several messages. So it's very hard to pick out a special message in a movie. In this movie I personally think it's that murderers aren't always bad people. Ed Delacroix is one example. He seems like a good guy in the way he takes care of Mr. Jingles and also in the way he treats Boss and his friends. Michael Clark Duncan gives an impeccable performance as the good-hearted prisoner John Coffey. Tom Hanks is a disappointment. He gives a rigid performance and is outclassed by the other lead-actors of the movie. I think a 2-times Oscar winning actor could have delivered a much greater performance. The movie is very boring in the beginning but after a magical healing of Paul Edgecomb's urinary infection the movie come to its turning-point. Overall the movie is good. It's a very good description on how it's to be on death row and i recommend it for everyone except those who requires realistic movies.

The slow pace at the beginning and the seemingly staged atmosphere is believed to have been created to convey a dream-like ambiance. I don't know whether everyone will find this film compelling but I think the ambiguity of the plot creates everything open to interpretation. After his wife Alice(Kidman) confesses a near act of infidelity, the good-doctor Bill Harbord(Cruise) goes on an odyssey-like walk through the empty streets on New York (Its suppose to symbolize his spiritual emptiness), in a vindictive pursuit to prove his character as a man.

Realizing this is the opportunity to reassure himself he ventures into the society only to be revealed as an intruder and cast out.
