This movie brought aliens back in the strongest way possible, everyone was singing Will Smith's catchy song of the same title. But I remember seeing this movie and just wearing out the VHS when we got it. As a 12 year old kid, I just adored this movie and so badly wanted to be apart of the Men in Black. I thought they were so cool. Years later, I got the DVD because I wanted to go for a trip down memory lane, this may not be as cool as when I was a kid but this is still a very fun sci-fi flick that makes you laugh, squirm and also has some good scares. There is a reason why Will Smith is a star, he made this movie a riot to watch and has every star quality you could imagine. He and Tommy Lee Jones take us on an incredible ride through our world where the person that lives next door to you just might be an alien.Agent K is a member of the Men in Black, a secret agency without ties to any government, whose goal is to maintain Earth as a neutral zone for aliens seeking refuge. K's former partner, D, has just retired, but identifies New York City detective James Edwards as a potential replacement, due to his agility to follow a disguised alien. After putting Edwards through several tests, K offers him the chance to join the MIB, which Edwards accepts. Edwards' past identity is erased, and he becomes Agent J, assigned to K by the agency director, Zed. The fleet warns that a Bug, a member of a giant cockroach-like alien species that are currently at war with another alien race, has crashed down to Earth and is seeking an object known as the Galaxy that would turn the tide in favor of the Bugs. To prevent this, they are willing to destroy the Earth unless the MIB can secure the Galaxy before their deadline within a day.The make up effects in this movie are just incredible. The main villain that was the bug was one of the creepiest looking things you've ever seen. Vincent D'Onofrio who is one of those great secrets of Hollywood always delivers an outstanding performance makes the villain even more creepier because of his jerks and twitches. The CGI effects are very noticeable but I don't think they could have gone any other way since the aliens are over the top. The humor is on key, one of my favorite scenes is when Tommy Lee Jones is trying to find out information and you see Will Smith in the background who is helping a lady give birth to an alien and the tentacles come out and start carrying him around everywhere and even slam him on the car. Men in Black is the definition of a summer blockbuster, it's funny, action packed, had the great actors and a very catchy song that is now stuck in my head thanks to this review. I still like Men in Black, I think anyone who just lets go and watches this film is guaranteed to have a good time too.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"29 November 2003","score":"29 out of 31 people found the following review useful","review":" God, do I remember when this movie came out in the summer of '97.

I know it kind of looks like a movie for Lifetime or U.S.A., but nevertheless it's a great movie that should really be given a chance. I cried during this movie, during the scene where Karen is on the phone with her daughter, Julie while she is being raped by Robert. All she can hear is her daughter's screams, cries for help, and her last scream. Nobody on the street will help this poor woman who is screaming for the police to get to her house. I just can't imagine that ever happening, when I saw this movie with my mom, she held me close and started crying as well. Nobody wants that feeling and Sally did a great job on showing the fear in her eyes and the total feeling of no hope or being helpless. Yes, it's a little over done and dramatic, but it's very real and I felt that it captured what every person has felt they wanted justice for victims. How do you live when a person you loved so much is murdered and the person that did it got off because they had bad parents? Or they had a bad incident or just feels insane for a few minutes? How crazy is it? I think that's what got me close to the film, though I have not had a close family member murdered, I think we can understand the pain and confusion these people go through in the movie.

I'm not kidding when everyone had told me that Zoolander was one of the funniest movies they'd ever seen, so I had to give it a chance. I'm really glad I did.Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson give a parody on male super models that is beyond tears of laughter. Ben Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, a 3 time Male Model of the Year award winner, when his streak of wins is stopped by Owen's character, Hansel, he starts to doubt his career and wants to go back home with his father and brothers as a mine worker. He pretty much fails due to the lack of his being used to high maintenance type of environment with clear air and less, well, work. When his father tells him that he's no longer part of the family, Ben gets the offer of his career or so he thinks. Will Ferrel plays Mogotu, an evil model agency owner who is trying to kill the prime minister of Molesia so he can continue to have children make his clothes. He figures people would assume that Derrek has lost it with his career so he can easily frame him and brainwash him into killing the prime minister for him. When a journalist played by Ben Stiller's wife, Christine Taylor, Matilda finds out about this, she tries to save Derrek by hiding him where no one would know he's there, hence at Hansel's house. Hansel is very forgiving and confesses that he was wack and Derrek was his inspiration to be a model and Derrek claims his wack of being jealous. There they have strong tea and learn of the lacking in Matilda's love life and why she hates models. Hansel playfully says I think we should get naked... don't talk, just give into the power of the tea. Followed by a very strange but amusing orgy where Derrek just happens to fall for Matilda. But Derrek will NOT miss a show and there is a certain relaxing music that will cause him to kill the prime minister of Molesia! Can he make it past the beautiful celebrities and save the day? Ben, Owen, Will, and Christine work perfectly together in this great comedy about male super models. This movie has non stop laughs and you'll immediately buy it when you see it.

There are some things in the film that I am less than happy about, such as the attempted rape in the hotel room in Reno.  I don't believe it actually happened.  I have read a few biographical books on Cobb and even though few people ever liked him, there were some things he would not do.  Its strange, but many people will see somebody who is detestable, in most respects, and that person is therefore guilty of anything that can be said about him.  Ty Cobb was a son of the south who never got over his father's murder, and he also never, ever, got over the Civil War. As I recall, he entered the major's in 1904 or 1905.As I said above, the movie Cobb is best viewed as a comedy; and I think it was intended to be seen as such by the film makers.  I compare it to the film, A Clockwork Orange.  In A Clockwork Orange you had a story of a guy name Alex who had things happen to him, often humorous, because of who he was.  At the end of A Clockwork Orange, in the last scene, you have to admit that you could only snicker at what was on Alex's mind listening to his beloved 9th once again, since he had now been cured. I also remember the scene in the film that you see from the Bible where Jesus is carrying the cross and is being flogged.  The camera pans back to the Roman who is doing the whipping, and it is Alex.In Cobb, the first part of the movie is one of the funniest I have ever seen; especially the ride down the hill in the snow to Reno. The film has a lot of truth in it but it actually leaves out a lot.  The Scene in which you see Cobb beating up the fan who is crippled is true. But what is not said is that the whole team put itself on the line in backing Cobb in what he did; they went on strike against Cobb's suspension.  So, Cobb was not hated quite like he was shown to be in the film, and the film did a discredit to Cobb in some areas.  Oh, by the way, that fan that was beatup in the film was Jimmy Buffet from Lost in Margaritaville music fame.  Jimmy is a good friend of Tommy Lee Jones.Actually, I rather doubt that you could make a real true film about Ty Cobb that could be saleable at the box-office.  Ty Cobb was not funny, and he had little sense of humor; he absolutely had no sense of humor about himself. He was a bigot. You did not dare make fun of him to his face. He could explode into a life threatening altercation at the drop of a hat. However, I do believe he was courteous to women for the most part, and that is another area I have problem with what is depicted in the film. Cobb was a Redneck and a great deal like many other Rednecks from the south at that time. In his time there was a great deal of KKK activity going on in the South and the rest of the country for that matter.  Cobb reflected his times, and never changed.Also, baseball was a lot different then than it is today. It was a completely different time. Baseball was the ticket for the poor and exploited to get out of the coal mines, the iron mills, or the farm fields. It was much more of a dog eat dog world than it is today. The average player today can move into some other endeavor if he didn't make it. In Cobb's time, it was back to the coal mines and an early death. To quote Ty Cobb It's no pink tea, and mollycoddler's had better stay out. Baseball was a do or die affair and there were no holds barred as long as you could get away with it.Cobb, in many ways was not that different than many, but he was the best baseball player of his time, and quite possibly the greatest that ever lived. And, he played baseball with a fury that nobody else, before or since, has played with. Unfortunately, he could not turn off that fury when he wasn't playing the game. For Ty Cobb, baseball was absolute war and he devoted himself 100-percent to playing it that way and he also devoted his mental capacities 100-percent to the study of getting the edge on his opponents. He would do or say anything to get you out of your game.  Cobb could also circle the bases faster than anyone who has ever played the game, with his spikes sharpened.

There are some things in the film that I am less than happy about, such as the attempted rape in the hotel room in Reno.  I don't believe it actually happened.  I have read a few biographical books on Cobb and even though few people ever liked him, there were some things he would not do.  Its strange, but many people will see somebody who is detestable, in most respects, and that person is therefore guilty of anything that can be said about him.  Ty Cobb was a son of the south who never got over his father's murder, and he also never, ever, got over the Civil War. As I recall, he entered the major's in 1904 or 1905.As I said above, the movie Cobb is best viewed as a comedy; and I think it was intended to be seen as such by the film makers.  I compare it to the film, A Clockwork Orange.  In A Clockwork Orange you had a story of a guy name Alex who had things happen to him, often humorous, because of who he was.  At the end of A Clockwork Orange, in the last scene, you have to admit that you could only snicker at what was on Alex's mind listening to his beloved 9th once again, since he had now been cured. I also remember the scene in the film that you see from the Bible where Jesus is carrying the cross and is being flogged.  The camera pans back to the Roman who is doing the whipping, and it is Alex.In Cobb, the first part of the movie is one of the funniest I have ever seen; especially the ride down the hill in the snow to Reno. The film has a lot of truth in it but it actually leaves out a lot.  The Scene in which you see Cobb beating up the fan who is crippled is true. But what is not said is that the whole team put itself on the line in backing Cobb in what he did; they went on strike against Cobb's suspension.  So, Cobb was not hated quite like he was shown to be in the film, and the film did a discredit to Cobb in some areas.  Oh, by the way, that fan that was beatup in the film was Jimmy Buffet from Lost in Margaritaville music fame.  Jimmy is a good friend of Tommy Lee Jones.Actually, I rather doubt that you could make a real true film about Ty Cobb that could be saleable at the box-office.  Ty Cobb was not funny, and he had little sense of humor; he absolutely had no sense of humor about himself. He was a bigot. You did not dare make fun of him to his face. He could explode into a life threatening altercation at the drop of a hat. However, I do believe he was courteous to women for the most part, and that is another area I have problem with what is depicted in the film. Cobb was a Redneck and a great deal like many other Rednecks from the south at that time. In his time there was a great deal of KKK activity going on in the South and the rest of the country for that matter.  Cobb reflected his times, and never changed.Also, baseball was a lot different then than it is today. It was a completely different time. Baseball was the ticket for the poor and exploited to get out of the coal mines, the iron mills, or the farm fields. It was much more of a dog eat dog world than it is today. The average player today can move into some other endeavor if he didn't make it. In Cobb's time, it was back to the coal mines and an early death. To quote Ty Cobb It's no pink tea, and mollycoddler's had better stay out. Baseball was a do or die affair and there were no holds barred as long as you could get away with it.Cobb, in many ways was not that different than many, but he was the best baseball player of his time, and quite possibly the greatest that ever lived. And, he played baseball with a fury that nobody else, before or since, has played with. Unfortunately, he could not turn off that fury when he wasn't playing the game. For Ty Cobb, baseball was absolute war and he devoted himself 100-percent to playing it that way and he also devoted his mental capacities 100-percent to the study of getting the edge on his opponents. He would do or say anything to get you out of your game.  Cobb could also circle the bases faster than anyone who has ever played the game, with his spikes sharpened. He was rather big for his time and was about the same height as Babe Ruth. Couple that size with that speed and the grit in his demeanor and nobody ever enjoyed or looked forward to playing against him.  What a ballplayer.

The airline sends a trauma expert Dr. Pearlman ,John Turturro, to examine Max as well as the other survivors to see if their all right and if not what treatment they would need. The movie Fearless concentrates on two survivors and one wife of a survivor who are in some way connected to each other. Because of the tragedy. Max's friend and architect partner Jeff Gordon, John DeLancie, was killed in the crash and left a wife Nan, Deirdre O'Connell, with two little children. Jeff greedily switched the tickets that Max gave him for the flight for cheaper ones that didn't have life insurance to cover himself. Carla Rodrigo, Rosie Perez, who also survived the crash, thanks to Max, lost her little boy when he fell out of her hands and was killed. This made Carla fall into a deep depression by holding herself responsible for his death.Max's change of life after the crash comes into conflict in dealing with the realities of both Carla and Nan as well as his wife Laura, Isabella Rosselini, in getting his life back to normal. Max soon develops a fearless attitude toward death and during the movie risks his life as if he were tempting death to see somehow that if he's really dead or not. Carla is the only one who seems to bring Max back to the real world with her depression over her sons death in the crash. That makes Max go out of his way to show her that she wasn't responsible. Having Carla her sit in his car one evening and having Carla hold a tool box, as if it were her baby boy, Max then crash the car full-force into a brick wall! This was to show her that she couldn't have held on to her child to save him from the plane crash a bit insane but it worked in curing Carla of her severe guilt feelings. The car crash also settled Max's not wanting to lie about Jeff's death. Jeff's lawyer Brillstein, Tom Hulce,wanted Max to lie about the circumstances of Jeff's death to get a bigger settlement. Now Max doesn't have to testify by showing that he became suicidal because of the plane crash and thus lost control of his mental faculties. It was shown in the movie, after Max survived the plane crash, that everything that Max did he seemed to be guided by some invisible force. Like the one which had Max lead those survivors of the plane crash to safety. This unseen force made those who thought that Max was a bit strange and odd see that he was in some way a changed but better person because of it. The end of the film seemed a bit confusing but thinking about everything else in the movie that lead up to it did somehow make sense. Max, with his wife present, picks up a strawberry from Nan's lawyers batch of gifts that he had and munches on it which seems to poison and kill him. It was explained early in the movie that Max had a deadly allergic reaction to strawberries since he was a child. With everyone thinking that he's dead Max miraculously comes back to life with his wife happily holding and kissing him.We've seen earlier in the movie Max eating strawberries, again tempting death, with nothing happening to him! So why then should anything like him possibly dying from eating the strawberries happen to him now when it didn't happen before in the movie? Was it that strange force or was it Max himself in getting him and his wife Laura back together since their strained marriage, due to Max's relationship with Carla after the plane crash, which had him and his wife on the verge of separating and divorcing!

But like history while there is a lot of good, there is also a lot of bad. Stigmata is when a person experiences the wounds of Christ's crucifixion. Supposedly there is proof that this really does happen throughout the world. I'm not sure if that is true but I do know one thing, that's pretty scary. After The Exorcist, the darker side of faith was brought to a lot of people's attention. Possession, now stigmata, either way it's terrifying. Of course a film had to be made, wither it's a question of this amazing paranormal phenomenon or just made for a good scare, Stigmata is a film that tries to touch the darker side of religion. Frankie Paige lives in Pittsburgh, she is attacked while bathing and receives two deep wounds on her wrists, and as the wounds are treated at the hospital the doctors cannot find the cause beyond that they are puncture wounds and go all the way through the wrist. On the way home on the subway approaches a priest and asks if he is Andrew Kiernan. After the priest tells her he is Father Derning, the lights in the train begin to flash, and Frankie holds onto the bars lining the ceiling as she is whipped from behind by an unseen force, Father Derning watching in horror. While Frankie is hospitalized again, the priest sends security tapes showing the attack to the Vatican, and Andrew is sent to investigate.

A few comments by some of the people below made me feel like giving my own view however.Oh and there are some SPOILER comments below so be careful if you have not seen it!First of all, despite what some reviewers have said, the plot IS a bit far fetched. Yes there are and have been matches between men and women in the real boxing world. BUT they do not consist of a young girl who has been training for under a year taking on a true PRO contender who has been boxing since he was a small kid!! Also the winning of the final in the end smacks of 'Karate Kid' rather than the gritty reality of a 'Raging Bull'... so don't fall for a lot of the comments belowBut I dont want to stress that point as I feel the film is really trying to put across a point (a very important point) that transcends strict realism. This is what moved me to reply to some of those who seem to want to maintain that the film is not feminist at all!? Some put forward that it's just a story of a girl who likes to fight (seemingly because she's a bit of a tom-boy) and so she starts to box and finds her niche that ultimately makes her happy?Although that is undeniably true to a degree, if that was all this film was about (or even primarily about) then the whole lack of realism would be a much more important defect overall... But for me its not really about that at all. Instead its about a girl who's very person has been overlooked and ignored both as a women in a male society and also on a personal level as a daughter with her (ambiguously) abusive and sexist father...Boxing doesn't give her just an outlet for violence, it allows her whole body (and a magnificent one at that ;) become the centre of attention for the first time in her life . As any boxer (or athlete) will tell you the attention given to the body of the boxer creates a great sense of empowerment and self esteem. The beauty of Kusama's film is that she portrays a young (feminist) woman not just seeking to do her own thing whatever the consequences, but one who is desperately seeking recognition and attention.In the end (BIG SPOILER) Diana is distraught DESPITE winning the fight exactly because she has lost the attention of the one person who has become most important of all; Adrian. The happy ending is only resolved once she gains both Adrian's admission that he gave (and still gives) her full respect as a person but also the attention that she craves.Finally as to whether Diana's character makes a good role-model... what's that got to do with anything?

In particular the ending of the film lends itself to dissatisfied viewers. However, to understand the ending, and the film as a whole, you have to understand that the very act of 'seeing' is being called into question. Thomas, after first seeing the couple in the park, continually attempts to form what he sees into a narrative that makes sense to him. Throughout the film, the attempts to simplify the complex situation into a simple one, and constantly he is discredited. First, he thinks they are illicit lovers, which is discredited when he finds a gun in the photograph. Thus, he constructs a new story for himself in which a murder has taken place. This is supposedly confirmed when (after smoking a joint) he goes and finds the body, for the first time without his camera. This scene can be interpreted in a number of ways. First, both the absence of the camera and the supposed touching of the body could be attributed to his intoxication. Or, often, the absence of the camera is used as evidence that the sequence takes place in a dream. However, the important thing is that doubt is cast over the whole experience, but once again, Thomas feels sure. However, once the photographs and body are gone, he is left to question the reality of his assumptions and experiences. Finally, at the end, Antonioni does to us, what is done to Thomas. By making him simply disappear off the grass, he toys with the audience, forcing us to question whether the main character, himself, ever existed, and universalizes the process that Thomas has undergone. So, while the film can be difficult to watch, it is less so if you watch it while questioning what you and the characters see. Do not try, as Thomas and, unfortunately, the marketers of the film do, to fit it into a simple and easy to understand narrative. Allow yourself to question your expectations about what you are being shown. This film, in fact, may be even more relevant and important in today's political climate than when it first came out.

This was what was Oscar worthy to me, because I loved the special effects and Robin Williams. Even though I think I over did it with the Oscar worthy thoughts, still to this day I enjoy Jumanji. It's a great family film that will make you feel good and have fun with.Robin Williams plays Alan, a boy who when he was little and had a horrible fight with his father plays a game with his friend, Sarah, and the game happens to be cursed causing Alan to get sucked into the game until someone else plays it. Sarah freaking out by just what happened runs home and no one believes her leaving Alan behind for decades in the game. When a new family moves in, Judy and Peter and their Aunt Nora, they find the game and start playing and release Alan who has just survived decades in a jungle. When they realize that they must finish the game to make the horrible curses it brings go away, they find Sarah who is now the town loony, and must play it 'til they finish. But can they do that with all the spiders, elephants, lions, tsunami, vines, stampedes, and an angry hunter? You'll just have to wait and see.This is a great movie for the family and I'd highly recommend it for a good watch. It's just a fun fill adventure with great effects and some fun performances by Robin and Bonnie and a very young Kirsten Dunst.

I saw this one sitting on the shelf of my local video store and rented it on a lark.  This is an adaptation of a play written by the late Terence Rattigan (The Browning Version, Separate Tables).  Here it is brought to the screen by another famous playwright, David Mamet, who wrote the screenplay and directed this film.  It concerns the true story of a young boy who was expelled from the British Naval Academy early in the twentieth century for allegedly stealing a postal order.  This movie is very much a play put onto film.  The sets are almost exclusively interior and the action is carried forward through dialogue.  Events not at hand are explained through theatrical devices such as reading a letter or someone remarking on what's happened.  At times I wished the director had made it more of a movie but it's still a very good film, mainly because the key actors are so good.Mamet's wife, Rebecca Pidgeon, plays Catherine Winslow, the little boy's older sister.  She's an outspoken but gentle woman who's strongly in favor of women's rights.  Jeremy Northam plays Sir Robert Morton, the lawyer and member of the House of Commons who takes the Winslow case.  He's outwardly reserved but inside he's as passionate about justice as Catherine.  Both of these actors give outstanding performances.  And as you might expect, there's a little romance suggested between the two by the end of the film.I wish I knew more about the Winslow case because the film assumes you know most of the facts already.  It must have been an important event in early twentieth century British history because they've made several films about it, including one made in 1948 with Robert Donat (Sir Robert Morton), Margaret Leighton (Catherine), and Cedric Hardwicke (the boy's father) that I'll have to see.  There must be nuances about the relationship between the government and the common man in this case that are only hinted at here.Very good entertainment and the acting will knock you off your feet.

At times I wished the director had made it more of a movie but it's still a very good film, mainly because the key actors are so good.Mamet's wife, Rebecca Pidgeon, plays Catherine Winslow, the little boy's older sister.  She's an outspoken but gentle woman who's strongly in favor of women's rights.  Jeremy Northam plays Sir Robert Morton, the lawyer and member of the House of Commons who takes the Winslow case.  He's outwardly reserved but inside he's as passionate about justice as Catherine.  Both of these actors give outstanding performances.  And as you might expect, there's a little romance suggested between the two by the end of the film.I wish I knew more about the Winslow case because the film assumes you know most of the facts already.  It must have been an important event in early twentieth century British history because they've made several films about it, including one made in 1948 with Robert Donat (Sir Robert Morton), Margaret Leighton (Catherine), and Cedric Hardwicke (the boy's father) that I'll have to see.  There must be nuances about the relationship between the government and the common man in this case that are only hinted at here.Very good entertainment and the acting will knock you off your feet.

I saw this one sitting on the shelf of my local video store and rented it on a lark.  This is an adaptation of a play written by the late Terence Rattigan (The Browning Version, Separate Tables).  Here it is brought to the screen by another famous playwright, David Mamet, who wrote the screenplay and directed this film.  It concerns the true story of a young boy who was expelled from the British Naval Academy early in the twentieth century for allegedly stealing a postal order.

Partial spoilers will appear at the end to justify the above.Dylan Walsh and Pruitt Taylor Vince definitely take the credit for delivering the most believable performances, but Paul Newman and Bruce Willis certainly don't shame themselves. The female contingent was a bit weak, but Jessica Tandy takes the honours as being the perfect gentle old lady. Melanie Griffith let the side down, I believe she was trying to charm the male viewer, but it was painful to watch.Content-wise, as I say, the story's mundane, and is stuffed with the kind of emotional schlock to which only the likes of Billy Chrystal (but in a different way, obviously) stoop. However, if you don't want an action movie, this fits the opposite role perfectly. There's nothing intrinsically wrong with mundane storylines if done well (c.f. Take Care of Your Scarf, Tatiana by Kaurismaki).Action movie fans should definitely look out for the car chase scene, which also contains the film's biggest shootout, and the most impressive brawl!Honest ;-)(partial spoilers here)Examples of the low-points were the utterly predictable parts such as - there was obviously going to be some ultimate denoument with the cop (the 'chase scene' above). - his luck would come around at cards at the end. - the kid being persuaded to be brave near the end. - after the repeated references to the daily trifecta bet and the 'low' of Sully not being able to make the bet the only day he would have won it, we are force-fed the high of finding out the son made the bet for him after all. - Toby was obviously going to try to hitch up with Sully towards the end of the film._Painfully_ predictable, I have to say.The 2-second highlight of the film, however, is when Sully throws Carl, half his age, out of the window. Particularly good as we get to see it more than once.
