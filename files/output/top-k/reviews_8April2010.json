Later I learned of all the scorn heaped upon it, and figured it was one of those shabby films that only seems entertaining when you're not old enough to scrutinize it in the least (e.g. the Ninja Turtles live-action movies). But I rented it today for curiosity's sake, and I still like it. I honestly don't understand why it's gone down in history as one of the worst films ever made. If any of them deserve scorn, it's Superman III. But that's a different review for a different day.I'm not going to claim this is a great film. It does have problems. Except for a few nicely-constructed models (particularly the Russian space station), the special effects are bargain basement. It doesn't have as many nice character moments as the first movies or Superman Returns. The plot doesn't flow naturally. The green crystal is an unsatisfying Deus ex machina (and really confusing in light of the first movie, although I think we're supposed to believe this is a separate crystal piece of the spaceship that we didn't see before &#x96; maybe they should've made it purple to avoid confusion). A number of things come up only to be dropped. And, perhaps most unfortunately, the real issues of the Cold War and nuclear disarmament aren't fully explored. But Superman IV is not a bad piece of entertainment, and it's refreshing to see a movie that depicts the world as a place where people can rise above all the hatred and evil and forge a better future.I could criticize this movie for being scientific nonsense, but the Superman movies have always been closer to fantasy than science fiction, and this isn't really any worse than the others. We have Superman talking in the vacuum of space and being heard by astronauts, but that happened in II with Ursa. And a lot has been made about how he telekinetically moves things in this movie by looking at them, but Zod did the same thing in II and that didn't seem to bother anyone. Him ringing the doorbell from the balcony to appear as Clark Kent once Lois turns her head is stretching credibility, and the part where Lacy is taken into space is stupid, but little things like that aren't what ruin a film in a series where heavy suspension of disbelief is par for the course. Lastly, none of the plot holes are that serious, and most of them are just a byproduct of the (admittedly clumsy) editing job done to improve the film's pacing and remove a braindead subplot.Now I'll focus on the positive things. The part where Clark playfully reveals himself as Superman to Lois, consults her for advice, then reinstates the mental block, is great. It was pretty much the only thing I remembered from watching the movie as a kid, and there's a reason. It's beautiful, funny, and provides insight into the Man of Steel's mind. The subplot with Lacy and her father is good for some laughs. The humor and drama are in a ratio that I consider good, as in Superman Returns and the Donner Cut of Superman II. Probably the biggest highlight is Lex Luthor. He may have natural hair for no apparent reason, but he's the same magnificent bastard he was in the two Superman films I love. The lines written for him and Gene Hackman's performance are both top notch. And, while I'm on the subject, Christopher Reeve does a great job too, although there isn't a whole lot to his role in this film (excepting the scene described above). On the minus side, Margot Kidder phones it in, and the rest of the supporting cast is so-so. Jon Cryer is wasted as Lex Luthor's teenage nephew.There is one thing that really annoys me about Superman IV The Quest for Peace, mainly because it baffles the hell out of me. Holograms of Kryptonian elders appear to Kal-El in the Fortress of Solitude, and none of them are the same elders who appeared in the first two movies. Makes sense, couldn't get the actors, y'know. Except John Hollis, who played one of the Kryptonian elders in those movies, is in this movie in a totally different role (Soviet general). I mean, seriously, what's up with that? The bottom line This isn't a bad movie. I don't know if I'd recommend buying it, but you should rent it if you like Superman, or if you want to show the kids something fun that isn't violent or obscene. It's a pleasant, optimistic, fairly engaging action-fantasy story, and it has lots to offer those who look to the '80s with nostalgia. And be sure to watch the deleted scenes, because one is better than anything in the feature. It's a clever bit of political commentary that depicts the Cold War arms race as an '80s arcade game, with all the quarters going to Lex Luthor and his fellow war profiteers.

But if there's one film that Ron Howard did managed to make which was close to perfection that would be A Beautiful Mind.A Beautiful Mind is the story of the life of the famous mathematician named John Nash (played by Academy-Award winner Russell Crowe) as the movie starts off with him as an undergraduate at Princeton University. Nash is a very awkward person and seems to have some issues, but he is a natural born genius. He meets a peculiar fellow named Charles Herman (played by Paul Bettany) who happens to be his roommate and the two get along quite well. He meets other colleagues like Martin Hansen (played by Josh Lucas), Sol (played by Adam Goldberg), Ainsley (played by Jason Gray-Stanford) and Bender (played by Anthony Rapp) who will help Nash later in his life.Time goes on and Nash gets hired by a man named William Parcher (played by Ed Harris) who hires Nash for a secret military operation that involves Russian attacking the US with nuclear bombs. Nash also meets the lovely Alicia Larde (played by Jennifer Connelly) while teaching a class at MIT in which both of them have some sort of liking between the two of them.The movie goes on as Nash battles between keeping his love interest, his job, and his sanity.A Beautiful Mind is a fascinating work of cinema. What I adore about this movie is the acting. Russell Crowe is phenomenal in this movie and basically stoled the show. He turned from strong, warlike gladiator to odd mentally, challenged mathematician and still turned out to be great! The screenplay and the dialogue are exceptionally well.

It's great because it shows the tribulations of mental illness and how it can affect the people around you. It shows that love is more than meets the eye. It shows that caring for someone doesn't mean giving up on them because they have an incurable problem.Ron Howard has presented us with a movie that is both entertaining and emotionally stratifying that it is worth your time to see this near-perfected work of art.

For the most part, these films disappoint because of unrealized expectations. There's no reason for studios to do this; they're marketing their movies to people who wouldn't like them (which leads to bad word of mouth), and alienates the audience that would actually like the film. The trailer for The Opposite of Sex promises a gleefully wicked and twisted comedy, but what the film offers is anything but.DeeDee Truitt (Christina Ricci) is a sixteen-year-old who after the death of her step-dad, takes off from her Alabama home and heads to Indiana to with her gay half-brother, Bill (Martin Donovan). To avoid giving anything away, I'll stop at saying that this leads to a number of complications.As much as I griped about the film being horrifically mismarketed, I still liked the film. I'd give it a weak recommendation, but I wouldn't hesitate in doing so. It's well acted, and I actually felt for a lot of the characters.Christina Ricci has completely rejected Hollywood, and instead concentrated on perfecting her craft instead of becoming a tabloid queen. Her hard work has paid off; few performances are different from DeeDee Truitt and any of the wholesome characters she's played in Disney movies. DeeDee is the ultimate problem child foul-mouthed, slutty, and completely amoral. Yet Ricci allows us really feel for DeeDee on some level. As Bill, DeeDee's half-brother, Martin Donovan is like Ned Flanders, only not as obnoxious (and gay instead of evangelical Christian). He's too nice for his own good, but he's not a complete doormat either. He's still pining over the death of his lover, Tom (Colin Ferguson), which is affecting his relationship with Matt (Ivan Sergei). Speaking of, Matt is a self-acknowledged dim bulb, but he's not as dumb as he first seems. Small, but over the top, performances by Johnny Galecki and William Lee Scott are also effective.Many people have been raving about Lisa Kudrow's performance as Tom's sister, Lucia. It's effective, but for the most part not much different than her usual characters. She's just more cynical and less ditzy than her other characters. But the differences aren't all that noticeable. Kudrow is effective, but Sheriff Carl Tippett, played by Lyle Lovett, is the one I felt for the most.

DeeDee is the ultimate problem child foul-mouthed, slutty, and completely amoral. Yet Ricci allows us really feel for DeeDee on some level.

Many people cite the films references to the Odyssey as an important part of the story, I don't however see this. That's not to say there aren't any, what I am trying to say is that the film is more reliant on it's own unique and interesting characteristics, as opposed to those of a 4000 year old text.The colour in which the film is shot, is possibly one of the most important elements in generating the character of the picture. I think that shooting the picture, without the colour correction which was used in O Brother, would of detracted from the feel of the film. The dusty look, sums up the character of the Southern states. It also gives something of a dirty and lower class feel, which is perhaps important when we consider the backgrounds of the three lead characters.The music of the film is another important element. Which is again one of the things the film would not be able to be as enjoyed nearly as much without. The music adds to the rustic feel that the colouring of the film does. It also helps push through the spirit of the era in which the film is set. A particularly strong example of this is the Baptism scene. Christianity is obviously an important part of life in Ameirca, and the Gospel bands that have appeared in that area have spread throughout the world. This scene is particularly entertaining, and the music enhances the effect. If they had chosen any other type of Christian Hymn the scene would weaken considerably.However I am critical of the lead Actor, George Clooney. He dominates the film, in a larger then life manner. But, I don't think this is a good thing. From the opening moments, Clooney grabs the film by the throat and doesn't let it go. There is rarely a point where he is not centre of attention, and he always seems to position himself so that he is the dominate figure in a scene. Even in cases where he shouldn't be. The scene in the Barn is particularly irksome, with Clooney hogging the camera. I was amazed to learn that he earned a Golden Globe for this performance, because I really think that this is George Clooney at his screen hogging worst.I won't however fault what is an otherwise entertaining film on the basis of one actor. It is overly an interesting and enjoyable film. It is not something which I would ever own, or even something I would go out of my way to watch. But nonetheless I think it has a unique appeal and is certainly something worth having seen at least once.

But I will offer two observations. One is that Leon is not lascivious. Many if not most or all would-be viewers presume that it will be, and then are disappointed, or, like me, amazed that it is not. It is easy to understand the expectation. How could the story of a disturbingly attractive 12-year-old girl adopted by a single middle-aged man under bizarre circumstances - he literally holds the power of life and death over her - not be lascivious?

It is, after all, basically a movie about nothing more complex than a group of youngsters being assaulted by demonic forces in a cabin in the woods.Funnily enough, Sam Raimi's breakneck, intense debut feature movie retains all of its power and is, arguably, just as easy to enjoy and respond to as it was all those years ago.The cast do what's needed of them but not much more, even the magnificent Bruce Campbell. The mighty chin, Ellen Sandweiss, Richard DeManincor, Betsy Baker and Theresa Tilly really just have to stand around and react accordingly to the madness that whirls around them (be that sexual assault by particularly lively foliage, demonic possession or mirrors that seem to lose their solidity).The script is no great shakes either, mostly just being the thinnest of character sketches, some exposition and screams and screams.No mistake about it, this is Raimi's show. From the impressively ballsy Raimi-cam to the limits he can push his favourite human piñata (aka Campbell) to, the lad barged his way into a genre that would take him in, love him and allow him to mature with a variety of future projects, including the sequel to this very movie.Sometimes it's hard to see nowadays why some movies are praised as genre classics by fans who seem to be doing nothing more than following tradition.

Pictures Batman movie franchise, the second of two directed by Joel Schumacher, was released. I remember seeing a trailer for it, which made me interested in seeing it, but I may have been a little too young at the time. I even had a Batman & Robin poster up in my bedroom for a while in the late 90's. I think it was a birthday present. However, I never actually saw the film until late 2005, after I saw its three predecessors for the first time. At that point, I had just recently learned how terrible it was generally considered to be! From what I remember, I thought it was pretty bad the first time, which was not surprising, and my second viewing (hopefully the last time I ever see this film) was slightly worse! Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson are now a crime-fighting duo with their alter egos, Batman and Robin, and there is more trouble on the rise in Gotham City! Mr. Freeze, formerly Dr. Victor Fries, is now a criminal who must remain at sub-zero temperature in order to survive after a terrible accident. He currently has his wife cryogenically frozen until he can find a cure for her disease, MacGregor's Syndrome! Meanwhile, in South America, Pamela Isley works for a scientist named Dr. Jason Woodrue. She sees her boss make a monster named Bane, so the insane scientist kills her, but she comes back to life as an evil, seductive, poisonous plant lover named Poison Ivy! After she kills Woodrue with a toxic kiss, she is lured over to Gotham City knowing that Woodrue's work was funded by Wayne Enterprises, and takes Bane with her. Mr. Freeze intends to freeze over the world, and Poison Ivy has evil plans with her genetically modified plants! She even causes conflict between Batman and Robin with her sexual powers! I don't know what Mr. Freeze is like in the comic books, but in this film, he is one stupid villain played by Arnold Schwarzenegger! It doesn't take long for this to show! Uma Thurman is really pathetic as Pamela Isley, and gets worse when her character becomes Poison Ivy! Even though Dr. Jason Woodrue isn't in the film for long, John Glover's performance in this role is also memorably lame. While Thurman plays Poison Ivy, she does a bad job trying to sound sinister and talk in a different accent. It seems like Thurman actually tried to put on as bad a performance as possible here, and she sure helps make a lot of the movie hard to watch! It doesn't help that Chris O'Donnell is back with his idiotic portrayal of Dick Grayson\/Robin, and he may be even worse here than in Batman Forever. Poison Ivy makes Robin fall in love with her, and these two would make a great couple because they're so annoying! It gets so stupid with both Robin's love for Poison Ivy and his love for Barbara Wilson\/Batgirl. Most of the performances here are poor, and that certainly isn't the film's only problem. The script is also very weak, with SO many ridiculous lines of dialogue and other severe flaws in the writing that I don't know where to start! They're just too numerous to mention! Joel Schumacher really brought the Batman franchise down in quality with Batman Forever, taking over the directing after Tim Burton directed the first two installments, both of which are entertaining. However, Schumacher polluted it even more with this follow-up, the last one in the series before Christopher Nolan rebooted it in 2005! For some reason, sometime during the last hour, I started to find that I wasn't as disgusted as I had been for the most part, even though the extremely cheesy dialogue keeps coming. The scenes with a seriously ill Alfred Pennyworth generally weren't done so badly, and I guess some of the action is at least half-decent. This is the only reason why I'm giving Batman & Robin a 3\/10 instead of a 2, and I'm not even sure if I should be doing that, with all the atrocious aspects of the movie!

In the interim it seems to have got even better - if such a thing is possible.Marlon Brando is Vito Corleone, the mafia don whose empire starts to crumble when he opts out of a move into narcotics, only for war-hero son Michael (Al Pacino) to enter the fold, jettisoning his father's dream that he'd become a senator. It's grand and sweeping, and yet intensely personal a wonderfully-acted fusion of family saga and human tragedy whose key players inhabit a vivid world of fierce ethics and bloody violence. Coppola and co-scripter Mario Puzo (who wrote the source novel) have plenty to say about family, honour and the American Dream - and the classic scenes are just legion.Some have argued that Brando's Oscar-winning performance is really a supporting role, but despite a lack of screen time he dominates the entire film and provides many of its finest moments. There's the moment he learns of Sonny's death, then calls in an emotional favour (Look how they massacred my boy), and a simply staggering two-handed sequence in which he maps out past and future to his successor. I thought that... when it was your time that - that you would be the one to hold the strings, he says. This wasn't enough time, Michael, it wasn't enough time...The old-fashioned storytelling, complete with impeccable production design, is augmented by Coppola's use of '70s innovations, like overlapping dialogue and informal out-of-focus close-ups, as well as Nino Rota's unforgettable score. The staggering ensemble includes not only Brando and Pacino (who is simply brilliant), but also James Caan as the last word in likable hotheads, Robert Duvall playing pragmatic family lawyer Tom Hagen and veteran Richard Conte, superb in his key supporting role as Don Barzini. It's a magnificent movie.

The staggering ensemble includes not only Brando and Pacino (who is simply brilliant), but also James Caan as the last word in likable hotheads, Robert Duvall playing pragmatic family lawyer Tom Hagen and veteran Richard Conte, superb in his key supporting role as Don Barzini. It's a magnificent movie.

In the interim it seems to have got even better - if such a thing is possible.Marlon Brando is Vito Corleone, the mafia don whose empire starts to crumble when he opts out of a move into narcotics, only for war-hero son Michael (Al Pacino) to enter the fold, jettisoning his father's dream that he'd become a senator. It's grand and sweeping, and yet intensely personal a wonderfully-acted fusion of family saga and human tragedy whose key players inhabit a vivid world of fierce ethics and bloody violence. Coppola and co-scripter Mario Puzo (who wrote the source novel) have plenty to say about family, honour and the American Dream - and the classic scenes are just legion.Some have argued that Brando's Oscar-winning performance is really a supporting role, but despite a lack of screen time he dominates the entire film and provides many of its finest moments. There's the moment he learns of Sonny's death, then calls in an emotional favour (Look how they massacred my boy), and a simply staggering two-handed sequence in which he maps out past and future to his successor.

First off, after the initial flashback at the start of the movie, has to be the worst five minutes of acting by anyone i have seen on screen. The woman who plays Martha is either an absolute genius, a relative of the director, or someone off the street. It's not even laugh inducing, it's pretty hideous.The rest of the film is your predictable, horrible people on the camp getting killed, in pretty boring ways to be fair, whilst an old man appears every now and again with a really big cigar laying down the law.Poor old Angela, she gets marched around for a lot of the film by some man who wears really tight trousers promising her ice cream.The plot and story is incoherent, and the script is dire at best.So why five stars? The freaky totally unexpected ending. Wow. if you haven't seen this and thought you'd seen the best twist movie ever, see this.It's probably the most freaky thing you will ever, ever see.This final shot makes the rest of the film passable.

And yet, it was an uplifting movie that fills the viewer with hope, almost like a cleansing process.The story revolves around Beth and Jake, a couple with several children who are living in what many would consider to be poverty. They have a small house in a run down neighborhood. Jake spends most of his time at the same bar with the same friends. Beth struggles to manages her family, which includes several troubled teens.One son has already left home, it seems, and has joined a gang. One son is being sent away to a facility for delinquent youth. The teen daughter Grace looks to be trying hard to help her mother take care of her younger siblings, but is pushed to the edge by the actions of her father and her mother's willingness to put up with it.When tragedy strikes, Beth looks to her heritage for healing. The scenes where the native rituals were performed were among the most powerful for me. The people showed such strength and intensity, full of spiritual reserve.Although I highly recommend the sequel, I think the open-ended climax will feel like real ending for most viewers. Very powerful, and deserving of a wider audience.
