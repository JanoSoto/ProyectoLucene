Before you know it, you're being set up for the much bigger picture &#x96; which is one massive theft of some stamps that evolves into a con itself. Yes, it's complicated but its the nature of the game and of the life the people within the film live. Nine Queens lures you in, like a con artist would. It lures you in and dares you to try and keep up with these rather shady but relatively smart and good-looking leads as they talk the talk and walk the walk in and about their chosen lifestyle. You don't want to fall behind and you don't want to feel as if you're being conned in the process.Such is the manner of Nine Queens, a film I sought out after watching director Fabián Bielinsky's quite excellent 2005, but unreleased in Britain, film entitled 'The Aura' which itself was a heist film of sorts but incorporated many other aspects of a theoretical and film-making nature. Nine Queens carries a distinct style and its twisting, intriguing narrative keeps on bending and twirling whilst providing necessary substance. This is more about introducing characters as archetype thieves to the degree the writer\/director deems fit and then allowing the film's plot, twists 'n' all, to just take over and force the fleshing out to occur if and when necessary.The thinking required for the film is kicked off in the opening scene. Juan (Pauls), a young and 'upcoming' con artist, tries to covertly rob an all night store in the same cheeky manner he has already done. The staff notice and he's in trouble but for Ricardo Darín's character Marcos, who poses as a police man and escorts poor Juan to safety. Juan realises that Marcos isn't a cop once they're out and gone and they exchange words. Turns out Marcos is a con artist as well and they banter. But did Juan get caught on purpose or is he just an inexperienced kid? Did Marcos step in because he needs a fall guy, or because he pitied the man? Who's acting? Who isn't? Who's playing who and who knows more than the other? The mind games in the exchanges have only just begun.Initially, I think the film is so bold as to actually play out in real time. The scenes of Juan and Marcos scouring the streets in search of potential cons, as Marcos adopts the teacher role in showing pupil Juan the tricks of the trade, are fascinating. Initially, the symbolism of each other's respective 'role' lies in their clothes. Juan's casual, young and therefore inexperienced 'role' is suggested through his casual jacket and jeans but is it just acting as a distraction? On the other hand, Marcos' suit and very formal get up suggests the term 'organised criminal', someone who takes pride in their dress sense and (albeit illegal) work. Someone rich with experience and with a certain guile &#x96; it suggests Marcos is perhaps smarter.But is Bielinsky leading us down a path with this visual representation and pretty basic student\/pupil set up? The bolt from the blue is the bombshell Marcos drops on Juan to do with the thieving of some priceless stamps, from whence the title of the film is born, due to be passed onto a Spanish buyer in the next few days. This is further developed when it is revealed Marcos' sister, Valeria (Brédice), works at the hotel the deal is supposed to occur in and doubles up as someone Juan seems to have his eye on from the beginning. Again, what does it all mean? Who knows more than the other? What's the con that's going on? With Juan needing a certain amount of money to aid in his arrested father's pledge for freedom, a sum close to half a million all of a sudden looks like quite a payday.But the film is more than a few cheery scenes of inventive cons and tricks. The film pauses for its characters to question themselves, raising issues of identity within this criminal circuit. While it doesn't glamorise theft or criminal activity, Marcos tells Juan of the misconception behind what it is they do. There is a consistent referring to how crooks are different to thieves, something that walks along the lines of theft and masterminding a con being an art-form in which it takes a certain amount of skill and acting in pulling off that sort of robbery. I believe this to be comparable to a 'crook' mentality, in which charging in with guns blazing and getting away with money whilst leaving a room of corpses is the alternative. Marcos argues that being a thief is not the same as being a crook and that there are other terms for thieves whereas a criminal is just a criminal.As the narrative draws to a close and certain revelations took place, I was amazed at how my own emotions had been twisted and manipulated. What at first seemed like bizarre coincidences or acts of basic stupidity perhaps propelled by a bad script were, in fact, planned actions designed to lull both us and certain characters in. There is a punch to Nine Queens, a gritty realism and a definite 'look' delivered on top of a neat little narrative that I think works really well. It even inspired the Americans to remake it in 2004.

It still is the best 'haunted house' movie ever made.It's a movie that puts its emphasis more on its atmosphere than anything else really.

It's a technically really well made movie, that of course also is being helped by the fact that it was shot in black & white. It gives the movie a more eerie and unpleasant atmosphere. It also really helps to bring the house to life, from both the outside as well as the inside.Horror wasn't really the most glamorous genre to work in during the '60's but just like Robert Wise did with The Day the Earth Stood Still he takes a genre to a totally different and far classier level, when compared to other genre movies from the same time period. This is what I always mostly admire about Robert Wise. He takes on a genre with his own touch and vision, with as a result an unique, as well as highly effective movie.The movie has some really effective genre moments, that will shock and will leave you with an unpleasant feeling afterward, without ever having to feature any blood or gore or anything of that sort. One moment especially really caught me off guard and in my book is one of the most scary shock moments in movie history.

It was slow and sorrowful death. The fans remained and the audience stayed true long after its passing. All that was left was the memory and sequels to past corner stones (Halloween, Nightmare on elm street, Friday the 13th). And then 1996 Scream came and breathed new life into the genre giving birth to one the greatest entry's and series in the genre.Scream may be called a spoof but its more a homage. Pulling together the original elements (masked killer, teens being stalked, the killer using a hunting knife, and a twist in the end). But it is not a spoof. Its not making fun of the genre its paying well due respect.The only difference is in Scream slashers exist and are consistently mentioned. A masked killer is recreating the films and the teens know it. But of course the practical police would rather play cat and mouse then sit through Prom Night which as Randy mentioned might have helped them out more then any silly lead would.The idea is itself is creative. Instead of just doing a imitation that takes itself to seriously *cough* I know what you did last summer *cough* it makes it fun. Pokes are made at slashers on occasion but are mostly in good fun and are not insulting.

And of course you laugh and say to yourself Of course! but despite its comical moments it has a nerve racking tone that puts it in its genre.The characters are as well a big part of the film's quality and they don't necessarily fallow the character stereotypes of slashers. We have Sidney Presscot, our main girl who will of course live in the end, She's strong, likable and just so happens to be the main target, We have Tatum Riley the silly best friend who you actually grow attached to and hope lives, The boyfriend Billy Loomis a smooth character who is suspect number 1, Billy's best friend and Tatum's boyfriend Stu Macher is a typical goof ball type but not the only comic relief, Randy Meeks is our slasher buff other comic relief character, Deputy Dewey Riley Tatum's older brother is a slightly slow but extremely lovable guy, And Gale Weathers is a very annoying, pretentious news reporter who wants to get the big scoop on the woodsboro murder spree and even pretends at first to like Dewey to get inside info and even though she is annoying at first she proves useful and I must admit you grow to like her. The character development is on a really personal level. You grow attached and really get to know the characters. Its hard to pin point the killer because you like them all. Even the first victim Casey Becker you feel for. In her 10 minute scene you get a real sense of her personality. The acting is more real and not silly. No outlandish screaming and the actors just look like scared senseless people. This movie is my personal all time favorite and a must see for any horror buff.

But Stanley Donen's film is more than a one-trick pony. 'Royal Wedding' boasts a number of enjoyable musical numbers, some played as conventional stage acts performed by the characters, and others &#x96; far more interesting, in my view &#x96; employing cinematic technique to produce musical numbers that would be nearly impossible to replicate onstage. Unfortunately, the exuberance of the songs is offset considerably by the lack of any interesting narrative, and a cast that (aside from Astaire, and Keenan Wynn as transatlantic twin brothers) is for the most part inconsequential and barely likable. Perhaps the mere notion of a royal wedding was then considered so exciting that sentiment alone was expected to substitute for a good story. Luckily, Donen's follow-up film, which I don't need to name, corrected this mistake.'Royal Wedding' follows the romantic exploits of brother-and-sister dancing team Tom and Ellen Bowen (Astaire and Jane Powell), both of whom have so far resisted all inclinations towards marriage and settling down, despite &#x96; in the lady's case, at least &#x96; no shortage of willing suitors. Notwithstanding the age gap between the pair, the film's story echoes Astaire's own vaudeville travels with sister Adele, who in 1932 retired from dancing to marry Lord Charles Cavendish. While serial sweetheart Ellen falls for a smooth-talking aristocrat (Peter Lawford), Tom rethinks his stance on love and marriage when he meets British dancer Anne (Sarah Churchill, daughter of Winston), who despite a colourless personality is at least closer to Astaire's age bracket than most of the leading ladies in his autumn years. Keenan Wynn, a funny supporting actor who I recently noticed in 'Song of the Thin Man (1947),' has a quaint double-role as two twins on the opposite side of the Atlantic, each of whom can't understand the regional slang of his sibling. Albert Sharpe plays a proud working-class British gent, the sort of role generally reserved for Stanley Holloway.The film's most interesting musical numbers are those that toy with reality. During Open Your Eyes, Astaire and Powell attempt to dance as their ship veers into choppy waters, and are frequently tossed about by the shifting inertia. Only when his character finds happiness in love, however, is Astaire able to master gravity itself, tappin' all over the walls and ceiling to You're All the World to Me with complete, blissful abandon.

The sequence was created by mounting a camera and its operator on a rotating set (a technique later used by Stanley Kubrick in '2001 A Space Odyssey (1968)'), and, aside from the technical ingenuity, it's a testament to Astaire's talents that he's even able to keep his feet as the ground under him continually shifted 360 degrees.

Although, I'm not gonna take a side in that debate, but I am gonna give Robocop the recognition it deserves. He was something that was totally new at the time (1987), and since then the movie got 2 (crappy) sequels, a comic book and a mini-series.Robocop is set in the future and portrays a very dark version of Detroit, and its crime level has gone up considerably. In it, a cop named Alex Murphy gets literally blown away by a gang of nasty criminals on his first day on the job. But later a company (OCP) uses his remains to build a mechanical cop in order to cut down on the crime in order to build Delta City to replace the corrupted dystopia that was once Detroit. Later on, Robocop makes a name for himself around the city, but unexpectedly he starts remembering what he was before his death, and through this we start to learn more about Murphy since we didn't zilch about him before he died. And this is how he starts to regain his lost humanity. And the first rule about making a movie with a robot for a character is that you MUST make it human in some way, that's the reason why Robocop worked so well and why Terminator 2 worked so well. Towards the ending, after he takes off his helmet for the final battle, reveals his face. And a little later, after the Old Man asks him for his name, he replies Murphy, this is one of the most heart-touching moments in science fiction which generally don't have moments like those.

Honestly, I have never seen a guy who looks like a 50 year old pencil pusher to be so threatening. He delivers his lines with such ferocity and perfection that he becomes perhaps one of the greatest villains in the history of cinema. And his classic lines, Can you fly, Bobby? and B*****s, leave! will never be forgotten. Also, his crew is worth noting, Emil will be known for the gas station scene (probably the best part of the movie), Joe will be remembered for his laugh and his Does it hurt? Does it hurt? line. And Leon will be recognized for his hilarious expression he makes when the disfigured Emil confronts him and when Robocop pulls his hair in the dance club. And lastly Clarence will be known for pretty much everything he does and says in here. And all these guys are MEAN, plain and simple. They basically kill and hurt others for their own amusement and express no pity or remorse at all. These guys are as real as movie villains could possibly get.The action is excellent, the gas station scene was bad@$$, the drug factory shootout was fantastic and the ending when Robocop takes out all the bad guys in the same place where they killed him at the steel mill is unforgettable, thanks to the Cobra Assault Cannons (forgot what they're called), but it's one of the sweetest weapons ever made up in a film.The one liners couldn't have been better. Dead or alive, you're coming with me is a quote that should've been on the Top 100, but for some reason, it's not. Your move, creep is another worth mentioning. And the before mentioned stuff that the bad guys say are pretty cool to say in real life situations as well.Robocop is a classic in the golden age of science fiction when we didn't have too many of that over-the-top, unoriginal crap that we're getting now.

On one hand, I loved some of the humor, notably the references to Smith's other creations, reviving Dante, Randall, Holden, and Banky into one picture. The humor at the Quick Stop that started it all is golden. Then there's moments from Will Ferrel, who's humor is foolproof and at home with Smith's crafted dialogue in spite of Ferrel's many improvisations. But Smith's films seem to reflect where he is at that moment in his life. Clerks was great, and while Mallrats suffered, they garnered a sizable cult following. Chasing Amy was a critical success and helped make a star out of Ben Affleck. It also succeeded because, like Clerks, it was very personal. Dogma, despite how outlandish the plot was, also had personal ties, as they addressed his feelings toward religion.So what does that make Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back? Besides revisiting the characters we love, it seemed like an exercise in excess. There's nothing to relate to in the film. The film is too self referential for its own good that there's nothing original or new in here. The humor is sporadic - in the very beginning and in the very end, it's hilarious. But it seems more like a bunch of cameos than in an honest movie. Smith was becoming more recognizable at this time and, if anything, the film seems to be about fame. But it's too much excess for me. It lacks the humanity of his previous efforts, which however perverse, had a heart at their core. That's why I liked Clerks, loved Chasing Amy, and liked Dogma in a special kinda way. This movie doesn't say anything and the dialogue is not nearly as sharp as it could be. If you like Smith's characters, you'll be amused to see them again, but Smith doesn't explore their dimensions as he had in prior movies. Jay and Bob, maybe, but let's face - there's not much too them. The movie's very slapstick, which isn't Smith's niche. It's still mildly amusing, but I've found it lacks the repeat pleasure of his other works.

","genre":null},{"date":"3 April 2009","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I'm always torn about this film. On one hand, I loved some of the humor, notably the references to Smith's other creations, reviving Dante, Randall, Holden, and Banky into one picture. The humor at the Quick Stop that started it all is golden. Then there's moments from Will Ferrel, who's humor is foolproof and at home with Smith's crafted dialogue in spite of Ferrel's many improvisations. But Smith's films seem to reflect where he is at that moment in his life. Clerks was great, and while Mallrats suffered, they garnered a sizable cult following. Chasing Amy was a critical success and helped make a star out of Ben Affleck. It also succeeded because, like Clerks, it was very personal. Dogma, despite how outlandish the plot was, also had personal ties, as they addressed his feelings toward religion.So what does that make Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back? Besides revisiting the characters we love, it seemed like an exercise in excess. There's nothing to relate to in the film. The film is too self referential for its own good that there's nothing original or new in here. The humor is sporadic - in the very beginning and in the very end, it's hilarious. But it seems more like a bunch of cameos than in an honest movie. Smith was becoming more recognizable at this time and, if anything, the film seems to be about fame. But it's too much excess for me. It lacks the humanity of his previous efforts, which however perverse, had a heart at their core. That's why I liked Clerks, loved Chasing Amy, and liked Dogma in a special kinda way. This movie doesn't say anything and the dialogue is not nearly as sharp as it could be. If you like Smith's characters, you'll be amused to see them again, but Smith doesn't explore their dimensions as he had in prior movies. Jay and Bob, maybe, but let's face - there's not much too them. The movie's very slapstick, which isn't Smith's niche. It's still mildly amusing, but I've found it lacks the repeat pleasure of his other works.

Revisiting it&#x97;so many years after its creation, as well as many since I last sat down to watch its entirety&#x97;gave me an interesting experience. How the three friends with me had never seen it is beyond me, but that fact caused something I never expected. Each moment of weight, those moments when the kids explain the pressures of each high school social class and why they are spending their Saturday in detention, still hit me as they did when I first watched it. However, my friends just laughed straight through, seeing the cheesiness and the way Andrew's buns-taping incident played out in a homosexual-like nature, amongst other reasons. As a result, I began to wonder if the film only holds up to me because I had seen it when I was younger; it holds a place in my memory and heart. Maybe watching it for the first time today just can never have the same impact; it's time capsule sensibilities just too much for the contemporary young adult to relate to. Either way, I could never discount its poignancy or subtle humor and I'm sure it will still be my favorite Hughes film when I'm fifty.John Hughes is an enigma. The decade from 1980-1990 was as good as you can have in Hollywood for him. With films like Uncle Buck, Planes, Trains and Automobiles, and Vacation, this guy was the end all be all for comedy. After Home Alone, though, his golden touch disappeared and he's never been able to rekindle that magic. It's gotten so bad that he's resorted to a penname, giving his writing credit for Drillbit Taylor to a fictional Edmond Dantes, (Dumas is rolling in his grave with that one). But those early films are classics. I completely understand my friends' experience of The Breakfast Club, I could see those homoerotic connections and the idiocy of some lines and events, but I couldn't bring myself to laugh at them. If they weren't there, I might not have noticed at all, that is how high an affinity I have of the movie. Until someone points out the shortcomings, (if they even are, I mean this is almost 25 years old), I see it only as how it is.What really wowed me upon watching again was how effective this film is with just dialogue. Besides a couple journeys outside in the halls or Dick Vernon's escapades, the entire film takes place in the library, much of which includes the five stars sitting on the floor. When Estevez tells his story, it is made even more impressive by the fact that it was a single take. The camera moves horizontally as he speaks, allowing those in the foreground and desk legs to obstruct your view until the pan moves further. Yet he continues his monologue, voice breaking and tears streaking &#x85; it really is a powerful scene. Every kid that goes to high school experiences the trauma and drama and messed up social structures created, every kid can see a little bit of themselves in one, if not all, of the group. Call them clichés, call them stereotypes&#x97;these five kids are you and I.I think we should also acknowledge the accomplishment of Hughes with this film, more than others, and what it has done to Hollywood. Many of his successes came with buddy comedies or family oriented vacations, all of which had multiple environments and bigger budgets. However, The Breakfast Club was so much more with so much less. Without this film becoming a hit based on dialogue and character interaction, we may never have seen the likes of Kevin Smith's Clerks, (a self-proclaimed fan who references Hughes often in his films), or the independent insurgence that was a result. This was one of the films that showed people a smartly told story that is relevant to its audience could be better than one in the moneymaking system. You could have young upstarts like the Brat Pack raking in the money. Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, and Molly Ringwald got their start here along with other 80s fare. You could argue that Judd Nelson's peak was as John Bender, that scared criminally inclined kid acting out on the weak and naïve to have some semblance of power and worth, something all but absent in his home life. And my favorite, Ally Sheedy, shows that being an individual&#x97;being yourself&#x97;is all that matters. Everyone here caters to their friends and their clique except for her. She transcends it all and becomes an island to herself. By far the shining light of the film in what she represents, I am still almost hurt that she lets Ringwald doll her up at the end. She is so much cuter when disheveled.I can't not mention Paul Gleason's stellar schoolteacher, who has seen the kids get cockier and himself more serious, or John Kapelos' Carl, the Man of the Year turned janitor. They just go to show how well fleshed out every character is here. Sure they all embody those aspects we single out, distilled into one host for the purposes of showing us a projection of high school, but I don't care. There is just something about The Breakfast Club that can never be changed in my eyes, no matter how much I understand new viewers' trepidations on its quality.

","genre":"Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"3 April 2009","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Along with Body Double, De Palma's definitive homage to his greatest influence, Hitchcock, an answer to PSYCHO, brilliantly tongue-in-cheek from the daft title to the answer of who the killer REALLY is, the director is at his very level best, crafting one incredible set piece after another. The contemporary theme of gender politics is utilized beautifully here and the whole idea of why the killer commits the grisly razor blade murder(..and stalks a second victim, played by Nancy Allen)is quite brilliantly executed. Unfortunately, like Hitchcock's masterpiece PSYCHO, De Palma's cat is out of the bag and everyone knows the identity of the killer. MAJOR SPOILERS Watching it for the first time in years, I grinned so many times at little sly moves conducted by De Palma in word and visual image, setting up the twist at the end so wickedly. Such as how bored house-wife, Kate Miller(Angie Dickinson)discovers after her sexual encounter with a complete stranger that he has a venereal disease, rushing deliriously in panic from his room. It's a sly move because you are horrified at the fact that she harbors that sin disease, believing this discovery will move throughout the rest of the film, only for her to meet her doom at the hands of a female with blond hair, black coat, and shades, slicing her with a glimmering razor blade. But, the way the tryst itself is executed was a wonder to behold. The way De Palma expresses on the side of the screen images of various items Kate lost along the way, them returning to her mind(..glove in the art museum, panties in the taxi, wedding ring left in her lover's room), how she initiates contact with the potential exchange with the lover without saying a word, how she attempts to slightly fight away her desire for the tryst, and her eventual terror for even instigating the frivolous sexual encounter at all. The way the transsexual killer's identity is discovered is also one hell of a doozy. We watch as Kate's psychiatrist, Doctor Robert Elliot(Michael Caine)listens to a feminine voice from his answering machine, a client on how she will be seeing another doctor, plans to have a sex change, and admits to borrowing his razor, threatening something criminal. Elliot has this recording, must meet at the police station with a hot-head, very disgruntled police detective, Marino(..De Palma regular, Dennis Franz, perfectly cast), and conceals her identity..why does he do this when it's basically a confession? The exciting race against time angle, involving prostitute Liz Blake(..the gorgeous Nancy Allen, in a role tailor made for her, who charms in a winning performance, bringing an amazing likability to a provocative character)who is told by Marino, in a very hostile way, that she is the chief suspect because of accidentally grabbing the murder weapon at the scene of the crime(..in the wrong place at the wrong time, she was at the elevator with a male client, who runs away, as the doors open to reveal Kate reaching out for help, the killer hiding). She has 48 hours to save her skin..to find evidence of the mysterious female killer, Kate saw in a mirror(..cleverly established by De Palma), while also being hunted by the psycho herself. There's an amazing set piece where Liz is stalked by the killer to a subway where she also is confronted by a gang of thugs and is painted into a corner when a police officer, a none-too-friendly exchange between these two, exits, leaving her to potentially fall prey to either one or the other. Her blossoming friendship to science wiz, Peter(..Keith Gordon, in a role he's often typecast, a brainy geek with some nifty inventions that come in handy along the way), the son of the slain Kate, is also a marvel of plot convention..together they are able to discover the killer's identity in a thrilling climax as Liz infiltrates Elliot's office, disguising herself as a new client in need of counseling(..her attempted seduction produces a smoldering sexuality Allen easily conveys)to retrieve a patient's name from his appointment book.

Unfortunately, like Hitchcock's masterpiece PSYCHO, De Palma's cat is out of the bag and everyone knows the identity of the killer. MAJOR SPOILERS Watching it for the first time in years, I grinned so many times at little sly moves conducted by De Palma in word and visual image, setting up the twist at the end so wickedly. Such as how bored house-wife, Kate Miller(Angie Dickinson)discovers after her sexual encounter with a complete stranger that he has a venereal disease, rushing deliriously in panic from his room. It's a sly move because you are horrified at the fact that she harbors that sin disease, believing this discovery will move throughout the rest of the film, only for her to meet her doom at the hands of a female with blond hair, black coat, and shades, slicing her with a glimmering razor blade. But, the way the tryst itself is executed was a wonder to behold. The way De Palma expresses on the side of the screen images of various items Kate lost along the way, them returning to her mind(..glove in the art museum, panties in the taxi, wedding ring left in her lover's room), how she initiates contact with the potential exchange with the lover without saying a word, how she attempts to slightly fight away her desire for the tryst, and her eventual terror for even instigating the frivolous sexual encounter at all. The way the transsexual killer's identity is discovered is also one hell of a doozy. We watch as Kate's psychiatrist, Doctor Robert Elliot(Michael Caine)listens to a feminine voice from his answering machine, a client on how she will be seeing another doctor, plans to have a sex change, and admits to borrowing his razor, threatening something criminal. Elliot has this recording, must meet at the police station with a hot-head, very disgruntled police detective, Marino(..De Palma regular, Dennis Franz, perfectly cast), and conceals her identity..why does he do this when it's basically a confession? The exciting race against time angle, involving prostitute Liz Blake(..the gorgeous Nancy Allen, in a role tailor made for her, who charms in a winning performance, bringing an amazing likability to a provocative character)who is told by Marino, in a very hostile way, that she is the chief suspect because of accidentally grabbing the murder weapon at the scene of the crime(..in the wrong place at the wrong time, she was at the elevator with a male client, who runs away, as the doors open to reveal Kate reaching out for help, the killer hiding). She has 48 hours to save her skin..to find evidence of the mysterious female killer, Kate saw in a mirror(..cleverly established by De Palma), while also being hunted by the psycho herself. There's an amazing set piece where Liz is stalked by the killer to a subway where she also is confronted by a gang of thugs and is painted into a corner when a police officer, a none-too-friendly exchange between these two, exits, leaving her to potentially fall prey to either one or the other. Her blossoming friendship to science wiz, Peter(..Keith Gordon, in a role he's often typecast, a brainy geek with some nifty inventions that come in handy along the way), the son of the slain Kate, is also a marvel of plot convention..together they are able to discover the killer's identity in a thrilling climax as Liz infiltrates Elliot's office, disguising herself as a new client in need of counseling(..her attempted seduction produces a smoldering sexuality Allen easily conveys)to retrieve a patient's name from his appointment book.

It was also my first Veronica Lake film and as gorgeous as she is, her voice grated on my nerves in the beginning.When I see this film as a comedy, I don't like it that much since I didn't find it to be particularly funny at times, but then again, I wouldn't really label it as a drama. Oh whatever! Phooey with labels! This film just stands on its own for me. I'm digressing, so what I really wanted to say was that I liked many aspects of this film, but in the end, I felt indifferent. I can say I enjoyed it at times and I definitely do not think it's a waste of time to watch it, thus I think people who haven't watched it should give it a go if they are curious. What I liked the most was its metafilmic aspects and how the director becomes somewhat like a method actor and becomes a hobo (and fails miserably). Through the story, I thought Sturges made some great commentary on the film industry. Starting with the beginning, Sullivan (McCrea) says he wants to make a serious film, but the producers say with a little sex in it and Sullivan says that it won't be the focus. Ironically, despite Veronica Lake's sort of small role, her sex appeal had much to do with the advertising of the film. Sturges knew that sex was needed for films to be successful because there is another line when Sullivan says, There's always a girl in the picture. What's the matter, don't you go to the movies? Also, Sullivan says that film should be used as a sociological artistic medium with a little bit of sex in it, which reflects this film. The sex bit could also be a nod towards Lubitsch films and that Sullivan's producers want him to continue making trivial films. I also wondered if the line about that musical Sullivan made, Ants in Your Plants in 1939 and how one of his producers says that he should make another one with a different date is a reference to The Gold Diggers of ((insert year)) musicals. There is commentary on the poor, which I don't want to delve into, but what I found to be particularly interesting was the take of comedies during the time period the film was set. The film was set in contemporary times, so there is World War II going on and Sullivan says, I want this picture to be a commentary on modern conditions. Stark realism. The problems that confront the average man! I was amused that he said this because in Germany, they already made films like this during the Weimar Republic.

A vote on the matter of creating an Army is coming up in the Senate and it looks like someone does not want Senator Amidala to be there. Chancellor Palpatine suggests Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker be assigned to protect her.Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen actually have pretty good chemistry with each other. McGregor fills in the Master role very well. They constantly bicker; Obi-Wan thinks Anakin is too rash and reckless, while Anakin thinks Obi-Wan is holding him back. The first third of the movie is rather good. The dialog and acting is still a little awkward but it is entertaining enough to distract the viewer. Anakin is still madly in love with Padme, and unfortunately their chemistry is not as good. The Jedi duo chase Padme's assassin through a city in Coruscant that looks like it was taken straight from Blade Runner. The time comes when Obi-Wan and Anakin must split. Obi-Wan investigates the Assassin while Anakin is assigned to be Padme's bodyguard on Naboo.Obi-Wan's investigation takes him to a planet named Kamino (that has been mysteriously erased from the Jedi archives) where he discovers a grand cloning facility. Unfortunately the film constantly cuts to Anakin's romance with Padme, which is not as interesting, if only for the fact that it doesn't move the plot. I wish they had figured out a way to develop their romance and advance the plot at the same time, because the film moves at a rather plodding pace. The dialog during the love scenes is not as bad as I remember it but it is still clichéd and pedestrian. It is something we have to endure, not enjoy. In the end I still do not really understand why Padme loves Anakin. I can see what he sees in her, but not vice versa. Anakin Skywalker touches the dark side for the first time when he fails to rescue his mother from Sand people. He slaughters the whole tribe, and Christensen is very good at expressing his anger, but the dialog fails him.Another problem I have is the deterioration of Obi-Wan and Anakin's friendship. I feel the ten year gap between films made this have less impact on the viewer than it could have. We don't really know the older Anakin Skywalker or the Jedi Master Obi-Wan, so when the former starts complaining about how Obi-Wan is holding him back we don't really know where he is coming from. It comes across more as whining and it is hard to sympathize with him. The conclusion of the film is quite entertaining, but the Count Dooku lightsaber duel is marred by obvious digital gluing of Christopher Lee's head on to the stunt double's body. It doesn't compare to the Duel of the Fates, but all in all it is a fun ride. Unfortunately, the Jedi are incompetent beyond belief in their decision to trust the Clone Army. There are many obvious hints that the Clone Army is connected to the Separatist movement and by default, the Sith. For one thing, Jango Fett, the original source for the clones, is allied with Count Dooku. Secondly, the order for the clones was unauthorized and Kamino was erased from the Jedi archives. Those facts alone should make the Jedi suspicious. Why the secrecy? It's almost as if someone had an elaborate plan to force the Jedi to use the army at just the right time... This is an improvement over The Phantom Menace mainly because it gets to the meat of the story. It puts all the chess pieces in place for the part of the story we're really waiting for.

There are many obvious hints that the Clone Army is connected to the Separatist movement and by default, the Sith. For one thing, Jango Fett, the original source for the clones, is allied with Count Dooku. Secondly, the order for the clones was unauthorized and Kamino was erased from the Jedi archives. Those facts alone should make the Jedi suspicious. Why the secrecy? It's almost as if someone had an elaborate plan to force the Jedi to use the army at just the right time... This is an improvement over The Phantom Menace mainly because it gets to the meat of the story. It puts all the chess pieces in place for the part of the story we're really waiting for.

The sight of Tarantino with a gun just makes me want to smash my own television. The sight of Tarantino killing someone makes me want to cry with despair at the state of the film industry. I can only hope that one day George Clooney faints with the genuine realization he chose to be involved in this heinous vile film. Why cannot other people see Tarantino as I see him and his awful cretinous mutilation and degradation films? I cannot be the only one. Every film he makes is sheer humiliation violence towards women. They are not 'cool'. They are designed to ridicule violently every character because Tarantino sets out to defile everyone and everything because he cannot create. He is a destroyer of images of beauty, of the human form and I am sick of hearing how 'cool' he is and that the films he makes are 'cool'. Clearly every woman in his films and especially this one are simply there for him to manhandle and humiliate, defile and then to kill... that is if he does not get to have rough sex with them first. The scene in the motel with Gloria the hostage who is crying with fear... she gets used as a gun gag and her brains are splattered on the wall. This is so vile and so cruel and especially that as a character in this film she is a middle aged woman, someone's mum and an ordinary woman. Tarantino's psycho character encourages her to relax so he can rape her then blast her face off. This apparently is funny. Hence my rousing identification of the true destructive and defiling nature of this rotten film. The showgirls in the Titty Bar are shown hacked up and tossed in a heap...because all beautiful women in Tarantino films really are monsters and if you don't f**k em first you'd better kill em. Tarantino's films are specifically designed by him to simply rip to shreds anything that is humane and beautiful and of value. His film world is one of emotional and physical brutality and the sheer obvious hatred of women of all ages. FROM DUSK TILL DAWN is a vile cinematrocity and should be studied for what it truly is. The scene where Harvey Keitel is begging his kids to murder him is just an atrocity on every standard of life any society holds with value. In this film Tarantino has written it as a part of his 'wacky adventure in the dirt'. Next time you have an accident in the street and lay bleeding in terrible pain and some pitiless passerby by says. ooh cool' as you pass out from the pain.. think of how well Tarantino has infected their psyche and eroded their humanity via his assault on society by films like this.

His father Peter (Armin Mueller-Stahl) is a self-taught pianist who teaches David his same love of piano and classical music. There is love there, but as portrayed in the movie, Peter is a rigid man who gives his son mixed signals. He drives his son to succeed as a pianist, teaching him that winning is everything, and yet, when David has opportunities that would take him away from the family, Peter won't permit it. The reason for this is that Peter and his wife lost relatives in the Holocaust. Peter is also given to physical abuse toward David when he loses his temper.David finally gets away from him and attends the Royal Conservatory in London, where, with the help of his teacher (John Gielgud), he wins an important competition but then suffers a severe nervous breakdown. The rest of the movie deals with the road back, which leads him home to Australia and to his wife, Gillian. Gillian is actually his second wife, though the first marriage isn't mentioned in the film.The dominant performances belong to Rush and Mueller-Stahl. Rush does a brilliant job of showing us the likable but stuttering David who speaks rapidly and repetitively, expressing himself through music. Mueller-Stahl as the tortured Peter is fabulous, a man who is both monstrous and pitiable. In a small role, John Gielgud of course makes a fine impression as an elderly teacher, a wonderful pianist himself, who believes in David's talent.The best scene is David playing Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto #3 - Helfgott's own recording of the piece is used - and the aftermath. What I missed in this film is music - there was a lot of talk about David's promise, but until the Rachmaninoff not much playing.Helfgott's work today has been deeply criticized for being - well, lousy. A review in The New York Times of one of his concerts is horrible. The reviewer, however, mentions that Helfgott occasionally showed vestiges of excellent technique. I think it's safe to assume that his playing nowadays is more erratic than it was in his earlier years. There are several examples of Helfgott's playing in the movie La Campanella, Hungarian Rhapsody No 2 In C Sharp Minor, Flight of the Bumble Bee, Rachmaninoff's Prelude In C Sharp Minor, Opus 3, No. 2, the previously mentioned Rachmaninoff 3, and Liszt's Sospiro, and it is all quite stunning. Rush does the fingerings himself. One of the comments also claims that Helfgott's wife has Helfgott perform on no medication so that he'll seem crazy - it's common for performers on medication for mental problems to have to cycle off of it before performing. I don't think the commenter has any idea what Helfgot is like on his medication - certainly in the film, he acts strangely.Shine is highly recommended for its fantastic performances, beautiful music, and its inspiring story.
