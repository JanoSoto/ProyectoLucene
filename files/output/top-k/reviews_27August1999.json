After obvious years of struggling, Bowfinger discovers a script written by his accountant and falls in love with the plot. Gathering his band of actors, and his writer the accountant, Bowfinger goes after some production company support, only to find that his only chance to get the movie produced is to have a big star signed on. The big star Bowfinger goes after is none other than Kit Ramsey, played wonderfully by Eddie Murphy. Ramsey refuses to consider doing the movie, leaving Bowfinger with only one option; to film Ramsey in the movie without Ramsey knowing it. What is left is a very witty, always enjoyable plot that never slows down.Martin is wonderful as the hapless Bowfinger and shows the characters unwaivering desire to make his movie at all costs. As usual there is a sweetness to a Steve Martin character, and while Martin could have choosen to spoof the uncaring, apathetic movie producer to a tee, he instead chose to give Bowfinger a very sensitive side to counteract the characters manipulative actions. You can't help but fall in love with Bobby Bowfinger, and a movie that gets you caring about its characters has won half the battle.Heather Graham, who plays the not so innocent Daisy, is good as the pure looking Ohio beauty who secretly will sleep with anyone to get to the top. She is not spectacular, while her appearance as usual is, but she holds her own in scenes with both Martin and Murphy, which is something not to many people could do. Christine Baranski plays the part of Carol, the over the top actress who stars in Bowfingers movie, to perfection and her comedy, I believe, unfortunately will be lost in the totality of the movie. I wish Martin had given her more lines, more parts, and more opportunities to show her talents because she is one of the better comedic actress's out there today.This movie, however, belongs to Eddie Murphy. Somewhere down the road, in the fog of action movies and record deals, many people forgot what a true comedy genius Murphy is. Names like Martin and Brooks and Allen are thrown around in the comedy circles as the deities of the profession, but Murphy is as good, and more talented than all of them.

The 13th Warrior chronicles the journey of an outcast Moor (Antonio Banderas) who becomes involved in a mission to save a Viking village from the onslaughts of some bloody thirsty cannibals. Originally entitled `Eaters of the Dead' and adapted from the Michael Crichton novel, this film has taken one and a half years to get to our local multiplex. Rumors of a $150 million plus budget and numerous scenes being reshot, I was beginning to wonder if this film would ever surface. Director John McTiernan was extremely upset with the film and the studio pulling the plug pre-emptly. There are reports that the studio pulled the plug then asked the angered director to reshoot the ending and various fight scenes. Let's just say this film was a behind the scenes mess.  What's so incredibly amazing is this film overcomes the plagued behind the scenes mess. The sweeping Viking mists, the longboat overcoming thirty foot waves, blood thirsty battle, and scenic highlands are just some of the mystique that have enchanted our minds on the views of Viking lore. What's really rich and never been done in Hollywood is the thought of an outsider entering this mystical world and letting us see it through his eyes. Banderas' Muslim outsider is kind, sensitive and passionate until he becomes embroiled in the honor of being a man of the North. He is among very few Hollywood heroes who are disturbed by the blood and gore associated with Viking civilization. But when he finds that the `unnamed' evil is only a man, his anger engulfs him and he begins to see a new vision of what man is. This is an epic in the greatest sense of the word.  The only ever evident flaw in this film is the ending itself. Why is it so short? Why is the climax not on a major scale? I know the symbolism associated with Vikings dying in battle and why didn't they take that to next level? The ending is only about 3 minutes when we should have been in the 10-20 minute range. On a positive note, this is the first Hollywood venture I have ever seen that takes Vikings seriously and I have wanted to see something in that nature all my life. I just hope because of all its problems they don't stop making Viking films. Previous Viking films have been on less than 10 million dollar budgets and looked like men dueling in woolen overalls. Anybody out there remember `Lee Majors' in `The Vikings' or `Tim Robbins' in the funny `Erik the Viking'? Well these were about the only Viking staples until `The 13th Warrior'. So go out and see this epic but when its done think what it would have been like if the final war scenes were 10 minutes longer. I hope Hollywood can hear me. (4 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.

Impossible?  Probably.  But cinema owes no respect to literature, so let's meet Lyne on his own terms.Plot rather dull.  The Humbert\/Quilty confrontation is necessarily muffled. Actually, I can't keep this up.  This LOLITA doesn't exist in its own right it suffocates in the shadows of its predecessors.  The whole point of the novel (NOT AGAIN.  GROAN...) was a mocking of ideas of 'plot' and character.  Humbert is a madman (he confesses to many stays at 'sanatoriums' (sic?)), supposedly dying in prison, who manages, in a first draft, to create a work of polished beauty and perfect artistry.  Yeah right.  He is constantly playing games with the reader, with Nabokov playing further games on him and us.  Whole passages, of seemingly vital plot importance, are undermined by parody, pastiche, allusion, word-games.  The vital final clash is played as hysterical farce, as is much of the book.How on earth do you capture this on film?  Kubrick ignored much of the (untranslatable) book to created a masterly black comedy, which forswore Humbert's mendacious viewpoint in favour of Nabokov's more detached eye (funny how the hyperintelligent Vlad failed to notice this).  It is, however, primarily a Kubrickian work, with the source material serving as a blueprint for many of the director's favourite themes, especially the idea of a moral monster as point of audience identification in his struggle with a repressive society.Lyne, rather facilely, thinks that because Kubrick did not stick to the letter of the book, that he somehow betrayed it.  His film is therefore superficially authentic - we are back in 'real' America, not Kubrick's English invention (which actually transliterated very well the book's themes of appearance, pastiche, deception and reproduction).  But throwing in a few 40s signifiers does not a sense of time and locale make, and Lyne completely fails to grasp Nabokov's use and subversion and understanding of popular culture, as one of the two forces shaping Lo.The major impression one gets from the book is the sweltering heat, the 'haze' (also Lo's surname), and this too is faithfully reproduced.  But this only serves to make realistic a novel which is always rupturing into the fantastic.  Lyne makes the fatal error of taking Humbert at his word.  The glorious mixture of wild, disturbing farce and poignant melancholy of the book, is seriously unbalanced by almost completely obliterating the former, and drowning the film in the latter.  Yes, we sympathise with Humbert, but he's a fiend - he has sex with pubescent girls; he enjoys his mastery and their pain; he tries to murder Charlotte, and only fails because he is too timid; he drugs Lo so that he can sleep with her unawares; the money he so generously offers her at the end was hers anyway, through her mother.  I mention these examples because they are suppressed in the film, as it tries to make of Humbert a tragic figure.  This is helped by the fact that Dominique Swain, wonderful nymphet that she is (although the ideal Lolita is surely Shirley Temple), is far too old, tall and beautiful for Lo in an age where Catherine Zeta Jones and Sean Connery are a viable box-office item, there doesn't seem to be anything all that distasteful about the relationship.And so the film is actually profoundly scared of the book, not daring to make us sympathise with an absolute monster.  The casting of Jeremy Irons conspires in this.  He is superb, his best since DEAD RINGERS, but he is not Humbert, he has no madness, no poetry; more like Charles Ryder twenty years on.  James Mason specialised in suave lunatics, and his perceived 'coldness' is a perfect interpretation of Nabokov's Humbert, as opposed to Humbert's self-image.  This LOLITA is as safe as can be - there is hardly any sex at all (I mean, we wouldn't want to offend anyone, would we?); the style is glossy and fatuous, TV-movie blandness, abandoning Nabokov's figurative language, and offering none of its own.  The detailed descriptions of landscape in the novel have an untranslatable moral import Lyne gives us a few blurry shots of trees.  The film is such a mockery of Nabokov that when we do get unimaginatively large chunks from the novel, they actually, unbelievably, sound daft.  The Quilty climax, one of the funniest scenes in literature, and perfect in the Kubrick (with Sellers how could it not be?) is reduced to FATAL ATTRACTION-style psychodrama (Nabokov, even beyond the grave, was spot on about modern cinema).  Once again, Lo's anguish, in the hands of a 'sensitive' male (Lyne), is reduced to hysteria. Very sporadically, there are moments of cheeky Nabokovian farce (especially when Humbert checks that Charlotte is asleep, and the interviews with Lo's principal), but the Nabokov tone is never caught, the sense of cartoon, non-sequitur, and sheer charming Humbert bull, is rejected as not being highbrow enough.  By trying to be so serious, the film ends up looking silly.

Humbert is a madman (he confesses to many stays at 'sanatoriums' (sic?)), supposedly dying in prison, who manages, in a first draft, to create a work of polished beauty and perfect artistry.  Yeah right.  He is constantly playing games with the reader, with Nabokov playing further games on him and us.  Whole passages, of seemingly vital plot importance, are undermined by parody, pastiche, allusion, word-games.  The vital final clash is played as hysterical farce, as is much of the book.How on earth do you capture this on film?  Kubrick ignored much of the (untranslatable) book to created a masterly black comedy, which forswore Humbert's mendacious viewpoint in favour of Nabokov's more detached eye (funny how the hyperintelligent Vlad failed to notice this).  It is, however, primarily a Kubrickian work, with the source material serving as a blueprint for many of the director's favourite themes, especially the idea of a moral monster as point of audience identification in his struggle with a repressive society.Lyne, rather facilely, thinks that because Kubrick did not stick to the letter of the book, that he somehow betrayed it.  His film is therefore superficially authentic - we are back in 'real' America, not Kubrick's English invention (which actually transliterated very well the book's themes of appearance, pastiche, deception and reproduction).  But throwing in a few 40s signifiers does not a sense of time and locale make, and Lyne completely fails to grasp Nabokov's use and subversion and understanding of popular culture, as one of the two forces shaping Lo.The major impression one gets from the book is the sweltering heat, the 'haze' (also Lo's surname), and this too is faithfully reproduced.  But this only serves to make realistic a novel which is always rupturing into the fantastic.  Lyne makes the fatal error of taking Humbert at his word.  The glorious mixture of wild, disturbing farce and poignant melancholy of the book, is seriously unbalanced by almost completely obliterating the former, and drowning the film in the latter.  Yes, we sympathise with Humbert, but he's a fiend - he has sex with pubescent girls; he enjoys his mastery and their pain; he tries to murder Charlotte, and only fails because he is too timid; he drugs Lo so that he can sleep with her unawares; the money he so generously offers her at the end was hers anyway, through her mother.  I mention these examples because they are suppressed in the film, as it tries to make of Humbert a tragic figure.  This is helped by the fact that Dominique Swain, wonderful nymphet that she is (although the ideal Lolita is surely Shirley Temple), is far too old, tall and beautiful for Lo in an age where Catherine Zeta Jones and Sean Connery are a viable box-office item, there doesn't seem to be anything all that distasteful about the relationship.And so the film is actually profoundly scared of the book, not daring to make us sympathise with an absolute monster.  The casting of Jeremy Irons conspires in this.  He is superb, his best since DEAD RINGERS, but he is not Humbert, he has no madness, no poetry; more like Charles Ryder twenty years on.  James Mason specialised in suave lunatics, and his perceived 'coldness' is a perfect interpretation of Nabokov's Humbert, as opposed to Humbert's self-image.  This LOLITA is as safe as can be - there is hardly any sex at all (I mean, we wouldn't want to offend anyone, would we?); the style is glossy and fatuous, TV-movie blandness, abandoning Nabokov's figurative language, and offering none of its own.  The detailed descriptions of landscape in the novel have an untranslatable moral import Lyne gives us a few blurry shots of trees.  The film is such a mockery of Nabokov that when we do get unimaginatively large chunks from the novel, they actually, unbelievably, sound daft.  The Quilty climax, one of the funniest scenes in literature, and perfect in the Kubrick (with Sellers how could it not be?) is reduced to FATAL ATTRACTION-style psychodrama (Nabokov, even beyond the grave, was spot on about modern cinema).  Once again, Lo's anguish, in the hands of a 'sensitive' male (Lyne), is reduced to hysteria. Very sporadically, there are moments of cheeky Nabokovian farce (especially when Humbert checks that Charlotte is asleep, and the interviews with Lo's principal), but the Nabokov tone is never caught, the sense of cartoon, non-sequitur, and sheer charming Humbert bull, is rejected as not being highbrow enough.  By trying to be so serious, the film ends up looking silly.

Dispirited, the good doctor finds himself burnt out and emotionally distant from his wife Anna (Olivia Williams.)  Then along comes young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment,) an eight-year-old boy clearly struggling with inner demons.  Cole's mother Lynn (Toni Collette) is having difficulty enough raising the boy on her own.  It does not help that the child is shy, sullen, and prone to sudden fits of unexplained panic.  Grasping for redemption, Dr. Crowe treats the troubled lad, eventually befriending him.  For only when Crowe earns Cole's trust can the boy fully explain his secret.  It would be wrong of me to divulge anything further.  The rest of the movie's secrets I shall leave for you to discover.The Sixth Sense is a triumph of tone and ambiance.  It manages to startle us, to make us grab the forearm of the person at our side, and to gasp at strategic moments.  With the aid of cinematographer Tak Fujimoto (The Silence of the Lambs), director M. Night Shyamalan infuses every shot with dread and foreboding.  In short, it is a highly successful thriller.  Yet its most impressive accomplishment is that it does not skimp on drama.  The movie is populated with three-dimensional characters that behave in real and honest ways.  Take Toni Collette as the boy's mother.  In a standard thriller, this character would be a throw-away, serving no purpose other than to complain to her son and disbelieve him at crucial points.  But in The Sixth Sense, the mother is a concerned parent who is struggling to put food on the table and maintain her own sanity, much less the sanity of her son.  She is a living, breathing person with strengths and weaknesses.  As a result, we empathize with her.  The same holds true for all of the supporting players, including the Doctor's neglected wife.The heart of the movie lies is the burgeoning friendship between Willis and Osment.  It works wonderfully, thanks in large part to Osment's outstanding performance.  Not since Radio Flyer and E.T. have I been so impressed with a young actor's abilities.  When the boy is in the throes of a panic attack, you feel it.  When he warily backs away from Dr. Crowe during their first meeting, you feel his hesitation as if it were your own.  By his own standards, Bruce Willis turns in a relatively strong performance.  It may lack the emotion of In Country and the flair of Death Becomes Her, but it is certainly two notches above his typical action work, such as his role in Striking Distance.  One element that I found lacking for much of the film was the relationship between Crowe and his wife.  Their estrangement seemed arbitrary, more a result of screenwriting necessity than of real life problems.  By the picture's conclusion, however, this plot line was sewn up nicely.The film has a unique conclusion, which will have viewers discussing it in the lobby, in the car on the way home, and around the water cooler the next day.  Some will love the ending.  Most will be surprised by it, but some will not.  I have mixed feelings in that while I found the final revelation to be intriguing, I wonder if it throws off the movie's delicate balance, sending it into standard thriller territory.

However, if one's idea of an enjoyment is watching a film about children dying, horribly, in a bus crash, followed rapidly by the appearance of leech-like, ambulance-chasing lawyers, resulting in the reduction of every moral and ethical principle to a monetarily-based bottom line, then this is the movie to watch.

Just an endless hash of grizzly torture and murder scenes, all of which err from a very bad childhood nightmare. (And you could tell this was done as more of a shock value then for chill.) That's not the downer of this movie, there's so much more. It was poorly written, directed, acted. To explain it's betrayal of genre, there was no suspense in the movie. In order to have suspense, a character must be in peril in some way or something unpredictable and shocking must happen. Nope, not here. Scene after scene was just discoveries of these gory brutalities, all of which were boring just as they were unpleasant. An overrated movie is one thing; It's the hype and the style of a film's release. But here, I don't know why anyone would like this. It's a terrible movie!Lets look at the perfomances. There was no momentum or sympathy in any of the characters. Brad Pitt was a young smartass cop who couldn't stop using four letter words, Gwyneth Paltow delivers one of the most empty performances of the 1990s (this is someone who got the Best Actress Oscar only a few years later!) and Morgan Freeman is sadly miscast. I'm surpised he still had his contract after this. And Kevin Spacey, as the killer, geez, what a joke!Does Kevin Spacey scare you? Now, he was psychologically taunting in the Usual Suspects, but otherwise...no. If Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, or Donald Sutherland approached me on the street, I'd be terrified.

The three other actors often play characters that are errie and macabre, eventhough they're unfortunately typecast. Spacey is only a little calmer than neurotic.

From its quiet opening in Vito Corleone's office, with the the blubbering appeal of Amerigo Bonasera (Make them suffer as I have suffered) to the closing of that same office door at the end, when Kaye comes to grips with the man she married, every frame of this film is filled with intrigue, images and treachery.You cannot view this film and judge its morality - it has none. It told entirely on its own terms. All the main characters are career criminals and the only law enforcement office in the movie is a corrupt cop protecting a drug dealer. To watch the movie, you have to accept its terms. If you do, you will be in for an experience of a lifetime.The wedding scene at the beginning is brilliant. Slowly but surely, all the characters are introduced, while at the same time, we get bits of information on their personalities and foreshadowing of future events. Note some of the payoffs that this scene sets up. That Paulie Gatto is a traitor (If this was someone else's wedding). That Bonasera the undertaker will owe the Don a service, to hide his son's massacre from his wife. That the plea of Johnny Fontaine for a movie role will result in him reluctantly agreeing to perform at a casino for the family. And of course, there is the introduction of the fearsome Luca Brasi.Marlon Brando makes this movie great. Don Corleone is arguably the most famous and most imitated character in movie history. The accent, the hand gestures, the sly smile he give Solozzo are  all a credit to an acting genius.The score by Fellini composer Nino Rota is one of the creepiest and most famous in film history. It complements the film rather than overpowers it, and gives the Godfather its unique quality. Gordon Willis' cinematography can only be described as perfect.The movie ends with the famous baptism scene in which Michael renounces Satan while executing all of his enemies - the baptism is the perfect alibi. In this scene, we learn how Michael views himself - a man in perfect control over his own world, above the law of both man and God. Truly fascinating.The Godfather also contains my single favourite line in movie history, spoken by Clemenza after the murder of Paulie Gatto Leave the gun. Take the canoli.I like Part II even more, because the plot is more involving and the flashback scenes to the rise of Vito Corleone are the best cinematic work ever (imho).

Well, I liked the dog.  He had more character developement than any of the human characters.  I don't think I have ever felt so empty after leaving a movie with this much action.  I don't think I have ever wondered so much how a film like this got made.  Especially since the guys behind the scenes are really good movie guys.  John McTiernan is a great director ( Predator, Die Hard ) and when Andrew Vajna was partners with Mario Kassar, he used to put his name on some really good projects ( Rambo, Angel Heart, T2 ) but what anyone saw in this picture is actually beyond me.  And to invest 110 million dollars in it is an absolute joke.  I can't imagine the two page treatment for this film.  Because you could actually do it in less than a paragraph.  A guy who can't fight gets thrown out of his land because he loves the kings wife.  Then for no particular reason he has to be the 13th warrior to fight a battle that has nothing to do with him or the other warriors.  He learns how to speak Nordic in about a week, he learns how to fight overnight and then we have about four really intense battles.  People die and some live and then the dog sits down and says a doggy prayer for the dead warrior.That is it.  Honestly.  There is nothing more to this story.  Supposedly this guy has to join these other warriors because the 13th warrior has to be a man that is not from the north.  But why that is was never explained.  There was no reason for his character.  No prophecy, no folklore, no religious purposes for him to be there.  He is just there so Banderas can be the attractive guy in the picture so ladies can swoon over him.  And you know a movie is bad when you start to critisize trivial things like how Banderas is the only one in the film that is well groomed, shaven and clean. The rest of the warriors look like warriors.  Banderas looks like he just stepped out of his trailer in every scene.  Then there was the scene when they were on the boat at the beginning and I said to myself If they have their horses after the journey on the boat is over, I'll laugh.   And they did.  Watching 13 horses and 13 men get off this tiny boat was like watching clowns get out of a mini car at the circus.  Where did they all sleep?  Where did they all stand?  Was there a basement?  Was there an extension to the boat that I wasn't aware of?  Were they in the spirit world?  Does God exist?  All very important questions, but no concrete answers.The action in this film was great.  The battles were bloody and violent but where was the story?  Where was the characterization?  To prove that it is possible to combine both of them wonderfully, check out Predator.  Seven guys, one beast, lots of action and great character developement.  This film has none of that ( except the action ).  You can see where this movie spent a hundred million dollars, but if it was that much why didn't they make a good story.  And don't pin this one on McTiernan, his direction was great.  Pin this one strictly on Crighton.  The film is creditting both McTiernan and Crighton as directors.  It is rumoured that the test audiences didn't like it so they hired Crighton to do some extra scenes to spice it up.  Why? The problem is not the direction, it is the story itself.  Having Crighton come in and fix the directing is like having Ed Wood come in and write a few chapters in a book because people think a book needs some spicing up.  First you don't hire a writer with no experience behind the camera to direct a few scenes and secondly, when will people realize that Crighton is not as good a writer as people think.  Jurassic Park was a hit film because of Spielberg, not Crighton.  ER is not a success because of him either.  He no longer writes for the show and it is better than it ever was when he was there.  This film is a disaster because of him.  There is no bleeping story.  NONE!  You can't have a film with no story.  Everyone knows that.  And what picture exactly is it that Banderas was in that guarantees a picture that costs this much is going to have a huge opening weekend?  Nothing.  Again, Zorro was the story and Spielgerg.  That is the only film that has ever been somewhat of a hit with him in it.  But Anthony Hopkins was also in that film.  So why would you make a picture with Banderas as the star?  And then to top it off you invest 100 million dollars?  What a joke!  So this is my chance to talk to all producers and studio heads.  Please, if you need any advice on what to invest your money in, please contact me.  I can do just as bad a job as some of the clowns in Hollywood now, and at a fraction of the cost.The 13th Warrior is a really bad film.  If you like action then I guess you may enjoy this.  But that is doubtful.  Even Commando had more of a story and a better script than this piece of garbage.  This is the embodiment of p**s poor film making, again not on McTiernan's part, but on everyone from the guys that wrote it ( Crighton ) to the guys that made it a go picture to those that financed it.  You all deserve to lose money on this project. It's movies like this that make me strive for Hollywood myself.  Because I know that all I need is to get my foot in the door.  One hit, and then you have about five years leeway to make it or break it.  Hollywood allows that. It allows you to make garbage based on the fact that you once made a good film or had a good script or whatever.  This film proves that.  What has Crighton done lately to substantiate his stories getting made?  Nothing.  What is the movie going to amount to?  Nothing.  And that is a promise.  If this movie succeeds to make even half of it's gross back ( about 55 million )in North America, I'll probably have a heart attack.

You can see where this movie spent a hundred million dollars, but if it was that much why didn't they make a good story.  And don't pin this one on McTiernan, his direction was great.  Pin this one strictly on Crighton.  The film is creditting both McTiernan and Crighton as directors.  It is rumoured that the test audiences didn't like it so they hired Crighton to do some extra scenes to spice it up.  Why? The problem is not the direction, it is the story itself.  Having Crighton come in and fix the directing is like having Ed Wood come in and write a few chapters in a book because people think a book needs some spicing up.  First you don't hire a writer with no experience behind the camera to direct a few scenes and secondly, when will people realize that Crighton is not as good a writer as people think.  Jurassic Park was a hit film because of Spielberg, not Crighton.  ER is not a success because of him either.  He no longer writes for the show and it is better than it ever was when he was there.  This film is a disaster because of him.  There is no bleeping story.  NONE!  You can't have a film with no story.  Everyone knows that.  And what picture exactly is it that Banderas was in that guarantees a picture that costs this much is going to have a huge opening weekend?  Nothing.  Again, Zorro was the story and Spielgerg.  That is the only film that has ever been somewhat of a hit with him in it.  But Anthony Hopkins was also in that film.  So why would you make a picture with Banderas as the star?  And then to top it off you invest 100 million dollars?  What a joke!  So this is my chance to talk to all producers and studio heads.  Please, if you need any advice on what to invest your money in, please contact me.  I can do just as bad a job as some of the clowns in Hollywood now, and at a fraction of the cost.The 13th Warrior is a really bad film.  If you like action then I guess you may enjoy this.  But that is doubtful.  Even Commando had more of a story and a better script than this piece of garbage.  This is the embodiment of p**s poor film making, again not on McTiernan's part, but on everyone from the guys that wrote it ( Crighton ) to the guys that made it a go picture to those that financed it.  You all deserve to lose money on this project. It's movies like this that make me strive for Hollywood myself.  Because I know that all I need is to get my foot in the door.  One hit, and then you have about five years leeway to make it or break it.  Hollywood allows that. It allows you to make garbage based on the fact that you once made a good film or had a good script or whatever.  This film proves that.  What has Crighton done lately to substantiate his stories getting made?  Nothing.  What is the movie going to amount to?  Nothing.  And that is a promise.  If this movie succeeds to make even half of it's gross back ( about 55 million )in North America, I'll probably have a heart attack.

A friend of mine bought it in UK, and we watched it together. And in the end, we were like, i'm going vomiting. So that's a real Leni Riefenstahl movie. Do you know her? Well, she directed the most influencing&greatest movies...for HITLER, for NAZISM. And this movie is thatA well-directed, good-played movie, but what it gives is, um, MEAN&CRUEL&WRONG ideas about us, the Turkish People. Like all of us are sadistic or something... Plus, before that movie, I had watched the incredibly great 'SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION', and didn't get any racist ideas about Americans at all. So, if you wanna see a real movie, with real things&a real story, then go and rent SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION immediately, and forget about the movie which is our case here. But if you already know some of us(TURKS), and have the RIGHT opinions, then see Midnight Express, and don't get influenced at all.

At the top of the list of the really good ones are Trainspotting and Basketball Diaries.  Permanent Midnight really tries to be as good as these, but it only ends up with about half the effect and resonance that Trainspotting and Basketball Diaries had.  Ben Stiller isn't bad at all.  In fact, it's the best work I have ever seen him do.  He's a believable addict and an obviously intelligent actor but he doesn't inspire or even shock you the way Leonardo DiCaprio and Ewan McGregor did.  Why?  Because the story is tired.  I realize that it sounds callous to say a drug-addict's story is overdone, but it is no matter how true the tale being told.  Along with that this story is far too one sided.  The only character we ever get to know is Stiller, everyone else appears to be an accessory to his lifestyle.  Therefore, actresses like Maria Bello and Elizabeth Hurley go to complete waste despite they're good performances.  I would guess that most of their roles ended up on the cutting room floor.  One actress does manage to put a little life into a nothing role though.  Janeane Garofalo's character is barely mentionable as far as the plot of the story goes, but her performance found depth in ten lines.  She doesn't save the movie from mediocrity, but she could have.  Basically this is a C+ film.  Rent it.  It's worth two hours, but don't expect anything profound.  I understand that the book is much better. ","genre":null},{"date":"27 August 1999","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  I've seen a few addict movies.
