This time it's a comedy\/horror approach, with a comic book like look & feel. What I liked best about PHANTASM III, is the fact that unlike PHANTASM II, Don Coscarelli had a more hands on approach to his own material with this one. Several of those people who worked on the first, returned for this one such as a blink & you'll miss her, cameo appearance by the actress who played the Lady In Lavender BILL THORNBURY as JODY. A. MICHAEL BALDWIN returned in the role of Mike & the gore that was almost completely excised from the previous sequel, has thankfully been returned to all of it's gory glory! The downside with PHANTASM III however, occurs after the brief recapping of the previous films & picks up immediately after II, with Reggie running towards a fiery car crash to try & save Mike & Liz, however this completely contradicts the ending of II. At the end of that film, Reggie was left lying dead on the side of the road. Here Reggie is alive & when Reggie stumbles upon an unconscious Mike. He picks up his four barrelled shotgun to blow away one of the Lurkers, the very same gun that he tossed away in the funeral home in II, while they kept the flame thrower, here the flame thrower is nowhere to be seen! When Reggie meets an orphaned boy at his home, the kid says he calls the dwarfs lurkers because they only come out at night, when in the first film, they were rummaging around the graveyard during the day & the sphere's don't appear to be heat seeking anymore & the fact that the Sphere's can leave the flesh of their victims & chase after others, when in II, it is revealed that they couldn't do that as long as they were embedded in flesh & a continuity error (goof?) where Mike has jumped out of an alternate dimension & Reggie is scared to touch the dimension forks to stop the Tall Man from coming through, Mike says Reggie did it before (a scene where Reggie touched the forks in PHANTASM I) the problem here is, the fact that Part I was proved to be a dream! So how would Reggie have remembered it if it never happened? also while Baldwin has returned to the role of Mike, he, along with Thornbury, are not given much to do during the films running time & appear to be somewhat less interesting characters, with Baldwin getting very little screen time. In fact Reggie is the one that takes centre stage here, as he has plenty to do here, going from town to town, trying to score with a rough & tough girl he picks up along the side of the road (who turns out to be gay) & dealing with a new side kick, a dangerous, but kind hearted, gun totting twelve year old kid! whom he encounters after the kid frees him from the back of his trunk, that he was stashed in by three petty criminals. His introduction is definitely one of PHANTASM III's highlights, as Coscarelli give us the horror genre's answer to HOME ALONE, as the kid brutally dispatches the three criminals who are trying to hurt him, in some rather gruesome ways, using booby trapped devices. As I stated in my summary above, I truly feel PHANTASM III LORD OF THE DEAD is the best film in the series, following the original. True it doesn't have the action sequences II has, but what's great about it, is the fact that it feels more like a true sequel, with all the original actors back. Wherein II only had Bannister & Scrimm. ANGUS SCRIMM is devilish perfection as the Tall Man, while Reggie was down right hilarious to watch! The comedy worked really well along with the horror. The special effects are great & the film has a few good stunts & some decent explosions, plus the film answers more questions about the Tall Man & we get a name for the dwarfs Lurkers & see the Tall Man making them & the flying silver sphere's sentinals & what is inside the spheres & how they work. They also yet again show a new device they also have inside them by shooting out on a latch, with an eye that is embedded inside. What's notable here, is simply the fact that Coscarelli has completely made away with the character of Liz, Mike's love interest in II, an angle that Universal put pressure on Coscarelli to make the film a bit more mainstream. Liz is killed off right in the opening minute of the movie, with her character never mentioned by Mike or Reggie afterwards, it's almost as if she never existed!. Coscarelli also touches upon cryogenics & comes up with an interesting device to stop the Tall Man, by freezing him up, since he hates the cold, an idea presented in I, but seemingly ignored in II. A great score, fine acting & fantastic direction, makes this a must see for horror fans. It's only let down by a downbeat ending, that again is just a rip-off of the first films ending.

It does not claim to be an accurate documentary &#150; what it is is one of Rodgers and Hammerstein's (R&H) finest musicals and like most of their work it has more to it than just the songs. From Oklahoma onwards R&H created a series of musical plays all of which had semi-hidden dark undercurrents. So whilst SOM is at times rather over sweet there is enough substance to the story to make it rather more than a good couple of hours of jolly escapism. Robert Wise's film version moves at a cracking pace until the rather long drawn out denouement after the Salzburg concert. The Nazis search for the family in the Abbey just goes on and on! SOM is a love story and some may find that the falling in love of the Captain and Maria really does not fire particularly well. I realize that this is a family movie (and one made in 1965) so we cannot expect too much overt passion &#150; but neither Julie Andrews nor Christopher Plummer really convinces as a character suddenly consumed with romantic fervour! Their eventual embrace seems improbable and rather stagy. You certainly don't get the feeling that they are in a rush to rip one another's clothes off! Far sexier is the superb Eleanor Parker who not only looks fantastic as the Baroness but manages to convey a much earthier attraction for the Captain. Similarly Charmain Carr as Lisl ('Sixteen going on Seventeen') is actually very adult and appealing in her feelings for the telegram boy Rolf. Ms Carr was in fact twenty-two going on twenty-three when she performed the role and you fell that she could give some tips to Maria rather than the other way around!So although SOM is an unconvincing love story that does not seriously diminish its appeal as a movie. Julie Andrews is superb as the children's friend and the release from the straightjacket that she engineers for them is convincing.

Fear so heavy you breathe it in. There's a menacing entity killing nearly at random, and no one knows where, when, or who it'll strike next. The authorities are working hard to bring the danger to an end, but they're seemingly blocked at every turn. As the tension mounts, everything the people of this place don't like or understand becomes suspect. Social conventions break down. Hysteria seeps into the hearts of these people, a good, hardworking, blue collar people. And it drives them mad.The story I've just told is essentially the story told in Summer of Sam, which I believe is Spike Lee's best film. The story takes place in the summer of 1977 in New York City, but social mores being what they are today, it could easily take place in any town in America today, right now. Replace the Son of Sam with a terrorist threat, and the situation becomes strikingly similar.The vigilantes who beat Richie at the end of the film are beating him because he works at a gay strip club, not because they think he's the Son of Sam. They don't like his hair or his music or his friends or his attitude, but in the end the straw that breaks the camel's back is his sexuality. As the country struggles with a potential Constitutional gay marriage ban, we need to think about where our anger toward homosexuality is really coming from. Is it coming from a sense of morality, or is it coming from a sense of fear?That's enough political mumbojumbo though. This is a stunning film, and don't let anyone tell you different. I noticed Adrien Brody in this flick long before anyone saw The Pianist, and I said then that he was going to be a star someday. He should have gotten an Oscar nomination for his work here, as should have John Leguizamo and Mira Sorvino, Leguizamo especially. He shows range I haven't seen from him since. The script plays like an Arthur Miller stage production. Tormented protagonist, fighting battles with his own soul that he should learn to let go of. A climactic moral test of wills. Society turning on an individual out of fear and anger.So props to Spike Lee, who may never be this good again. Malcolm X and The 25th Hour are also both really wonderful films, but for me, this one takes the cake. If you haven't seen it already, do so.

This was not always a good thing however as this middle of the road second adventure about Dr Jones from 1984 proved.In Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, we find Dr Jones in Shanghai in 1935. After a violent confrontation with a Chinese villain, Jones eventually finds himself in India. Taken to a small village, he encounters a badly treated people in need of help. To do this, Jones will have to travel to an ancient palace and combat the forces of evil.The key problem with this film is it's problems in the plot department. Whilst a fun film to doze off to on a Sunday afternoon, it is by a long distance the worst of the three Indiana Jones films. With a story involving an evil cult underneath an ancient palace, the story just doesn't have the special feeling which Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade thrive on. Whether because of a considerable lack of Nazi's (this film actually being a prequel to Raiders) or because Amrish Puri's Mola Ram just isn't that interesting a character, Temple of Doom simply feels lacking.At the same time, another problem with this film is the below par standard of acting. With characters like Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan) and Willie Scott (future Mrs Spielberg, Kate Capshaw), we should never have expected much, but both performances are, to say the least, dreadful. Add to this some awful performances by the villagefolk who Indy is helping, and you know there's problems.It feels a shame that so much of this film is wrong, when the other two films of the trilogy are so good. With bad choices in plot and characters (Denholm Elliot's Marcus is a necessity for any Indiana Jones film), the story never really takes off and feels awkward. At just under two hours long, this film seems to drag and makes you feel like your watching all three parts of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

It is those flaws in her personality that add to the perfection completeness and vividness character.She, Scarlett, had something strong and special on her, such as great determination, strong willpower, etc. once she decided to do something, she never gave it up and stuck to it until she reached her goals. She was strong-minded, brave, and could adapt to a new situation acutely. She, not like Ishley, faced the cruel reality undauntedly, instead of trying to avoid it. (We can't escape from it, when it comes, what we should do is face the music.) Let¡¯s see a example here. After the arrival of home, Scarlett fond nothing left on the homeyard---no food, no clothes, no mother since Negroes were set free, to survive, she yielded herself to work hard on the farm as a farmer. Her sisters were so loyal to the previous life and hated Scarlett for her forcing them to work in the fields. Anyhow, the homeyard had a good turnover. At the moment she was informed that she would lose her farm and house unless she paid 300 gold coins for the tax. All she had amounted to less than 10 gold coins in total. What could she do? To give in? No, not a chance. She ran around those old acquaintances to collect the money. She hated to borrow money Relter, who was her last hope. However, she decided to meet him in the disguise of the new dress made of curtain. All she had done was a complete waste. Relter was so playful and refused her. Bu chance she met Flank, her sister's financee and tricked him into marrying her, which added to hate of her sister for her and to criticism of the people on her. This seemingly revealed that Scarlett was a bad person. But just let us think about it. Do you believe that her sister would give the money to the family to get rid of the tax after her marriage? Scarlett knew sister better than us. She was wise to do that. All she did was for the good of the tara, her family. That Scarlett did something people at that time thought bad didn't mean she was bad. On the opposite side, she was a person with the completeness of personality. She could do something different and something that the people had never done or had dared to do before. At that time, woman wasn't considered as graceful to be a businesswoman and was criticized. By those who were conservative and loyal to their opinion about women. Scaelett had no notion of that. She knew if she had the ability, she could do that as well as men, so she took business as her career and indeed had done a good job. People's unfriendly reactions never stopped her. She was so strong headed a person that she was hardly shaky. Scarlett was so special and different, and set a good example to me.

At the moment she was informed that she would lose her farm and house unless she paid 300 gold coins for the tax. All she had amounted to less than 10 gold coins in total. What could she do? To give in? No, not a chance. She ran around those old acquaintances to collect the money. She hated to borrow money Relter, who was her last hope. However, she decided to meet him in the disguise of the new dress made of curtain. All she had done was a complete waste. Relter was so playful and refused her. Bu chance she met Flank, her sister's financee and tricked him into marrying her, which added to hate of her sister for her and to criticism of the people on her. This seemingly revealed that Scarlett was a bad person. But just let us think about it. Do you believe that her sister would give the money to the family to get rid of the tax after her marriage? Scarlett knew sister better than us. She was wise to do that. All she did was for the good of the tara, her family. That Scarlett did something people at that time thought bad didn't mean she was bad. On the opposite side, she was a person with the completeness of personality. She could do something different and something that the people had never done or had dared to do before. At that time, woman wasn't considered as graceful to be a businesswoman and was criticized. By those who were conservative and loyal to their opinion about women. Scaelett had no notion of that. She knew if she had the ability, she could do that as well as men, so she took business as her career and indeed had done a good job. People's unfriendly reactions never stopped her. She was so strong headed a person that she was hardly shaky. Scarlett was so special and different, and set a good example to me.

The image of the main actress Scarlett haunted me all the time. In my eyes, she is the most successful shaped image in the film. Even though she undeniably has some shortcoming, I still admire her. It is those flaws in her personality that add to the perfection completeness and vividness character.She, Scarlett, had something strong and special on her, such as great determination, strong willpower, etc. once she decided to do something, she never gave it up and stuck to it until she reached her goals. She was strong-minded, brave, and could adapt to a new situation acutely. She, not like Ishley, faced the cruel reality undauntedly, instead of trying to avoid it. (We can't escape from it, when it comes, what we should do is face the music.) Let¡¯s see a example here.

While I disagree with many people on Elijah Wood, who I think could have done a better job (mind you, the expectations I had from Mr. Wood were proportional with the importance of the part he played - which is the main part), the cast in general was well chosen and I do approve on the choice of Viggo Mortensen rather than Steward Townsend to play the part of Aragorn.I read that a lot of people disagree with the movie these days and I am not sure whether they do this because it's fashionable to be a rebel in the crowd or because they genuinely disliked the movie as much as they said they did. I find it for instance incredibly difficult to believe that they really could dislike the special effects in the movie. In the end, they were extremely well integrated in the movie and as opposed to the Mummy or the Mummy Returns, they were not overstressed and not so obviously fake.I agree that a couple of scenes were overdone, and the person in charge of those I thought was Orlando Bloom, who, despite the perfect way in which he was made to look Elven, did not act too Elven to my mind. His performance was, I thought, very fake and his good looks can't save him from that. On the other side of the acting are clearly Ian Holm, Ian McKellan, Sean Astin and Viggo Mortensen. If Boromir had been shown more, I would have placed Sean Bean in that list more. The movie began in a rustic, very peaceful manner, like the hobbit land is supposed to be and I found that very relaxing and gripping at the same time, because all the while you feel the menace of the Ring, due to Howard Shore's masterpiece, but then it turned into a more gripping and action-filled story mainly due to the appearance of the two sides of villains - Saruman's filth and the Nazgûl.

It is flawed, but it is still far cooler than RoboCop 2 (or RoboCrap as I like to call it). The drama in this film makes it unique amongst its predecessors, and it is much better than the likes of 'Batman Forever' (another film unique in its own franchise). **SPOILERS**The plot sees OCP going ahead with Delta City. They hire a mercenary group called 'Rehab' to 'escort' the people from their homes and into rehabilitation camps. The police hate this idea and once a stray bullet hits officer Ann Lewis, RoboCop is seriously p***ed off. The plot is simple, but it is superior in its simplicity. It is the campy one-liners and gags that let this film down on more than one occasion. Things like RoboCop commandeering a pimp-mobile and Sergeant Reid having to deal with a drag queen prostitute are just a few of the things that had me fuming at the television screen. I'd say it is for this reason that a lot of people hate this film with such a passion. Another reason that this repelled Robo-fans was because it had very little political satire other than the fact that the main characters were trying to beat the system for the good of the people. There is very little 'MediaBreak Advertisement' sequences, and even the ones that are shown have strong relevance to the story. This is probably because this film is aimed squarely at children so that more action figures can be sold. However, I quite enjoyed the drama of the people rebelling against the corporate monster OCP for the rights to their own homes. I especially loved the part where even the Detroit Police Department thought that OCP had gone out of line, throwing their badges at an OCP executive, and leaving the building to go and help the civilians reclaim their homes. This is something you don't usually get in a superhero film (if you want to call any of the RoboCop films 'superhero' films). **MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!**It is pretty obvious that they gave RoboCop a removable gun\/flamethrower attachment (it attached to his hand) to sell action figures. The same applies with the jet pack seen at the end of the film. However, I felt that they were incorporated into the film quite nicely, and the flying scene, however fake, is pretty cool if you take it with a pinch of salt. Especially with Basil Poledouris' theme music booming in the background.**END SPOILERS** Overall, RoboCop 3 does not deserve to be in the 'Bottom One-Hundred Films' list. I believe it should be in 'The Best Sequels' list. If you enjoy RoboCop because he's a superhero and not because the films he appears in (usually) have strong political satire in them, then this is the film for you. 6\/10.

The drama in this film makes it unique amongst its predecessors, and it is much better than the likes of 'Batman Forever' (another film unique in its own franchise). **SPOILERS**The plot sees OCP going ahead with Delta City. They hire a mercenary group called 'Rehab' to 'escort' the people from their homes and into rehabilitation camps. The police hate this idea and once a stray bullet hits officer Ann Lewis, RoboCop is seriously p***ed off. The plot is simple, but it is superior in its simplicity. It is the campy one-liners and gags that let this film down on more than one occasion. Things like RoboCop commandeering a pimp-mobile and Sergeant Reid having to deal with a drag queen prostitute are just a few of the things that had me fuming at the television screen. I'd say it is for this reason that a lot of people hate this film with such a passion. Another reason that this repelled Robo-fans was because it had very little political satire other than the fact that the main characters were trying to beat the system for the good of the people. There is very little 'MediaBreak Advertisement' sequences, and even the ones that are shown have strong relevance to the story. This is probably because this film is aimed squarely at children so that more action figures can be sold. However, I quite enjoyed the drama of the people rebelling against the corporate monster OCP for the rights to their own homes. I especially loved the part where even the Detroit Police Department thought that OCP had gone out of line, throwing their badges at an OCP executive, and leaving the building to go and help the civilians reclaim their homes. This is something you don't usually get in a superhero film (if you want to call any of the RoboCop films 'superhero' films). **MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!**It is pretty obvious that they gave RoboCop a removable gun\/flamethrower attachment (it attached to his hand) to sell action figures. The same applies with the jet pack seen at the end of the film. However, I felt that they were incorporated into the film quite nicely, and the flying scene, however fake, is pretty cool if you take it with a pinch of salt. Especially with Basil Poledouris' theme music booming in the background.**END SPOILERS** Overall, RoboCop 3 does not deserve to be in the 'Bottom One-Hundred Films' list. I believe it should be in 'The Best Sequels' list. If you enjoy RoboCop because he's a superhero and not because the films he appears in (usually) have strong political satire in them, then this is the film for you. 6\/10.

While it's true that it has absolutely nothing to do with the two Michael Meyers slashers that came before it other than the fact that we see commercials for the original Halloween film on TV sets in this movie a couple times, it's not true that this is one of the worst horror films ever made, as I've heard it called very many times. I saw the movie about ten years ago, when I was in junior high school, and the two things that I remember were bugs crawling out of the masks while they were on peoples' heads and that god-awful music they played during the Silver Shamrock commercials. So when I watched it again tonight I tried to look at it as a separate film from the other Halloween movies, because I think that it's association with them is a large part of why so many people hate it. In a horror series that at the time of this writing has spawned seven sequels, including this one, it's the one movie that simply doesn't belong. Unfortunately, even as a separate film, Halloween III doesn't have much going for it.Clearly, there was enough stock put into the disturbing nature of the crime involved, since we are not given a reason for its existence. An elderly toy maker has developed a scheme to sell masks rigged with secret electronic devices, then on Halloween night at 9pm stage a Big Giveaway on TV, at which point he will broadcast a special commercial I supposed reminiscent of those commercials in Japan that are supposed to give you seizures. This version will activate the electronic devices lodged in the masks and cause them to somehow turn kids heads into piles of creepy crawlies.What is the purpose behind this scheme? What does this guy hope to achieve? And what the hell does Stonehenge have to do with anything? His hordes of robotic assistants is at least explainable by his need for secrecy given what he's really up to in that factory (and I imagine they have something to do with his remarkable ability to essentially hold an entire town hostage without even a single person leaving and complaining to authorities.Early in the film, a guy runs frantically into a gas station asking for help and is brought to a hospital to receive medical attention. Once there, a well-dressed gentleman walks calmly into his hospital room and pulls his skull apart, then just as calmly walks outside, gets into his car, douses himself with gasoline and promptly sets himself on fire. The subsequent mess is left to the hospital staff to clean up, as the car is left smoldering in the parking lot the next day without an inch of police tape around it and a lab technician is left to pore through the ashes. What is truly funny is the length of time that this technician spends sifting through these ashes before she realizes that they are nothing but car parts, a stupendous explosion of idiocy that she describes as a 'colossal boo-boo.'The doctor working at the hospital takes it upon himself to do a little investigating into the situation, traveling to the town that houses the Silver Shamrock factory, which of course sports an Irish caricature of a man presiding over the local hotel. I have to admit that I thought that the 'misfire' scene was pretty impressive, and is one of at least a few scenes that tend to argue that this movie deserved a title that would not have cast it in an eternal shadow. For the first thirty minutes or so, the movie is very impressive. The opening shot of the man running as fast as he can out of a calm night is especially unsettling, as is that entire chase between him and his robotic pursuers, whom we know nothing about at the time. But the more we learn about what's really going on, the less believable the movie becomes, until it hits rock bottom with Conal Cochran, the evil toymaker, gleefully giving Challis, the investigating doctor, a tour of his underground facility and a detailed description of his wicked plans, coming dangerously close to a Scooby-Doo ending. I really don't think that the movie is as bad as so many people seem to think, it's just too bad that it starts out so well but by the end the last attacks of the final un-killable robot are simply tiresome. By the end, I was just waiting for it to end, but at the beginning I found it very interesting. I think that these two things balance themselves out in terms of the quality of the movie, and then the association with the other two previous Halloween films is just another nail in this movie's coffin.
