So Paramount let him go ahead and produce and direct their own films, and he proved the studio was wise to do so.By 1945 Wilder had done a wacky comedy, THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR about a military academy. The film was a box office success. It was followed by FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO, which gave a fictional account of the war in North Africa, and gave a stunningly good performance by Eric Von Stroheim as General Erwin Rommel. But Wilder and Brackett wanted to tackle a message picture. They found one in the best selling novel THE LOST WEEKEND by Charles Jackson. It tackled the issue of alcoholism. Alcoholism had actually been noted in motion pictures almost from the start, usually in comedies where a character (possibly the star, like Chaplin in ONE A.M.) would do his or her business while tanked. The 19th Century drama, THE DRUNKARD, was used by W.C. Fields in THE OLD FASHIONED WAY as the play Fields' troop is putting on. Another version of THE DRUNKARD was made into a full movie in 1940 called THE VILLAIN STILL PURSUES HER, with Alan Mowbray and Buster Keaton. Now and then a more serious problem would be shown. D.W.Griffith made his last film in 1931 about alcoholism, THE STRUGGLE (which was a flop). In SADIE MCGEE, Joan Crawford marries Edward Arnold who is an alcoholic (she eventually helps on this problem). Aside from Griffith's flop nobody made a serious film about the disease. Wilder and Brackett turned in a good screenplay that did just that.Don Birnan is a young man who claims to be a writer, but has published very little. Three people are aware of his weakness Don's older brother Wic, the local bartender Nat, and Don's girlfriend Helen.The crisis occurs the last weekend of the summer. Don is to go with Wic and work on his novel. But he disappears when he is supposed to be ready to leave. Wic has rearranged his own life for Don and is fed up. He leaves to go to the country house alone. He tells Helen not to waste her own life with Don, as Don is so far gone that he is not worth it. Helen (more troubled than Wic) does make herself scarce too. So Don, when he gets home, finds that he is really all alone on that long weekend. Well not totally alone - he's inventive, our Don. He hides bottles of liquor all over the house (the old joke about the whiskey bottle hidden in a chandelier comes from this film). Wic does try to find the hiding places, but Don comes up with new ones (including suspending a bottle from a window by a string. However even this is of little use, as Don's demons drive him deeper and deeper into drinking. He has little money left, and soon is out of credit at Nat's (who hates to give him credit for drink because it's harmful to Don). He even steals a purse at one point. He tries to hock his typewriter. All for the money for a drink. And then he ends up in Bellevue's Drunk Tank where he meets the cynical nurse Bim, who has heard all the remorseful stories of reform from Don and his ilk forever.There is far more to the screenplay than this synopsis suggests. Don's behavior is centered only on getting the sauce into him - and he does not care who is inconvenienced along the way, so that he finds himself quite isolated by the conclusion of the film. The movie's ending is hopeful, but just vaguely that. Somehow Don is such a weak character we can not be sure if he will ever turn his life around again.Wilder used Ray Milland in this film, and it is usually pointed out that Milland was normally in comedies like EASY LIVING, SKYLARK, or Wilder's own THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR. But he had played serious parts, most notably in BEAU GESTE, I WANTED WINGS, and (more recently) THE MINISTRY OF FEAR and THE UNINVITED. But Don Birnan was the first three dimensional figure he tackled, and he did splendidly in it. His Oscar guaranteed a decade of stardom, and a really interesting career afterward in directing and character parts. Jane Wyman plays Helen as a character who struggles to recall the man she loves up to the conclusion of the film - his weakness constantly threatening the relationship. Philip Terry's Wic is equally good, putting on the best face possible, until the straw breaks the camel's back. As Bim, Frank Faylen is understandably fed up with his ward charges at Bellevue - all claiming they aren't ill, but quite evidently recurring so. And Howard Da Silva, normally playing villains in the 1940s, played the understanding Nat as harsh but compassionate - he wants Don to straighten up and write as he claims he can. How real is the story here? There is an anecdote that Milland mentions in WILD EYED IN BABYLON, where he and Da Silva were in the set of the bar rehearsing a scene. They were interrupted by a bowler hatted little man with a familiar face, who came in and ordered a shot of whiskey. He paid for it, gulped it down before the two actors, and left the bar. They watched him go and did not say a word. It was Robert Benchley, working on another picture at Paramount at the next set. And Benchley had his own alcohol problems too.

The serial was just one fist-fight, shoot-em-up-explosion after another; but, what made this important is that Cody thus had no time to doubt, to question, even to pose - he had to take decisive action at every minute - and he did! - this was no typical wimp (which by the mid-'60s were cluttering up comics, books, and films), this was a Man Of Action! And the second I recall ever seeing from popular culture (after Eliot Ness in the Untouchables).So I was originally pleased when it became obvious that the Disney\/Spielberg people were going to put together a remake ... until I started noticing in all the hype, that nobody talked about it as a remake. In fact, nobody was mentioning Radarmen from the Moon at all. And by the time it was 'playing theaters everywhere', the horrible truth had sunk in - Hollywood was going to pretend that its real past - which was also part of my own history - never happened.Well, it DID happen. Which makes this remake - and a BAD remake at that.This is everything that Radarmen avoided - SLOW as mud; unnecessary pseudo-scientific explanations; a real wimp for a 'hero'; wretchedly mis-cast actors trying to come up with a good reason for being there; over-bloated cinematography and special-effects; uninteresting, mushy romance subplot; banalized nostalgia; patronizing to young viewers - everything that I loathed on television that drove me to watch Commando Cody to begin with.This is not an action movie; Radarmen from the Moon is an action-movie; this was just a bad excuse to print up promotional paper-cups at fast-food restaurants.Skip it.

I was on that boat; I was traveling up that river; I was amazed the Playboy gals were on that stage; I was shocked when they killed all the people on the river-boat; I was appalled by the sex-scenes with the Playboy gals; I was undone with each killing of the crew (Albert Hall was great), I saw all of the hallucinations from the drugs, and I'm a teetotaler (wow! for Sam Bottoms!) which allowed the real troops to survive the horror; I understood why the Frenchmen insisted on staying on their plantation and siding with the VCs; I felt the fear of the journey as they neared Kurtz's compound; I could feel his craze and why the photographer thought he was a genius; I recognized the zombie-like stance of the Cambodians; I was terrified when Willard first met Kurtz; I bit my tongue when Chef's head was thrown onto Willard's lap; I knew Kurtz kept Willard alive because he needed the assassination; I picked-up that Lance was accepted by the Cambodians, freak-like; I knew the assassination was coming when Willard emerged from the river; I was certain Kurtz was only waiting; I was terrified after the killing; I expected to be torn limb-by-limb afterward; I rejoiced when Lance and Willard began their journey down the river; I am glad none of us know what really happened, later.To those few who wondered if the killing of the water-buffalo caused an uproar, I had read soon after the film's release it was a religious celebration for the local Filipinos - Coppola's cameras just happened to be rolling. What a piece of drama that fit right into the plot.All of those actors who were offered the role of Willard surely must realize they screwed-up by refusing it - or, perhaps they knew they didn't have the stamina nor acting-ability to do it.

Lee Thompson's dark, disturbing pulp crime classic caused a stir in 1962 when it was released in cinemas. Not so due to people getting killed (actually only one character is seen killed on screen) - murder was, and still is, a common theme in film since the silent days. But rather to the film's explicit (for that time) approach to issues such as rape, stalking and child abductions.Samuel Bowdon is a middle aged, well-to-do lawyer who has a loving family, consisting of wife Peggy (Polly Bergan, who is stunning on the eyes) and teenage daughter Nancy (Lori Martin). His normal, quietly blissful life is disturbed by the presence of a man he helped send to prison for an aggressive rape act. Enter Max Cady (a very mean looking Robert Mitchum), with intense eyes and a uncontrollable gravitation to women. He had just served his term, but is still angry that he had lost eight years to prison. At first, Bowdon doesn't think Cady would do anything to his family (He's just been released from prison, he doesn't want to go back!). However, things turn for the worst when it becomes clear Cady IS stalking his family but the law is powerless to stop him and he hasn't DONE anything to the family.Cady pushes Bowdon's buttons by killing his dog, threatening his daughter Nancy with sexual abuse and beating up a teenage drifter to provide a sample of his plans for Nancy. The family then move to the isolated, moth-ridden Cape Fear swamp hoping to get away from Cady but Cady catches on and traps them there and aims to pounce on his prey...A fairly straightforward thriller, it does have its' drawbacks. Aside Mitchum's great performance, the other characters are very wooden. Bowdon's wife and daughter have very little to do in this film and just seem to be used here as bait to keep the film going. Polly Bergan almost ruined a perfectly tense scene when she is attacked by Mitchum on a houseboat. Her panting was so annoying to listen to, I had the mute button in handy.

So far, as well as improving our French we have considerably enhanced our appreciation of French cinema.What a breath of fresh air to the stale, predictable, unimaginative, crash bang wallop drivel being churned out by Hollywood. What a good example for screenplay writers, actors, directors and cinematographers to follow. It was so stimulating also to see two identifiable characters in the lead roles without them having to be glossy magazine cover figures. The other thing I liked about this film was the slow character and plot build up which kept you guessing as to how it was all going to end. Is there any real good in this selfish thug who continually treats his seemingly naïve benefactor with the type of contempt that an ex-con would display? Will our sexually frustrated poor little half deaf heroine prove herself to the answer to her dreams and the situation that fate has bestowed upon her? The viewer is intrigued by these questions and the actors unravel the answers slowly and convincingly as they face events that challenge and shape their feeling towards each other.Once you have seen this film, like me you may want to see it again. I still have to work out the director's psychological motive for the sub plot in the role of the parole officer and some of the subtle nuances of camera work are worth a second look. The plot does ask for a little imagination when our hero is given a chance to assist our misused and overworked heroine in the office. You must also be broad minded to believe in her brilliant lip reading and how some of the action falls into place. But if you go along for the thrilling ride with this example of French cinema at its best you will come out more than satisfied. Four stars out of five for me.

What a good example for screenplay writers, actors, directors and cinematographers to follow. It was so stimulating also to see two identifiable characters in the lead roles without them having to be glossy magazine cover figures. The other thing I liked about this film was the slow character and plot build up which kept you guessing as to how it was all going to end. Is there any real good in this selfish thug who continually treats his seemingly naïve benefactor with the type of contempt that an ex-con would display? Will our sexually frustrated poor little half deaf heroine prove herself to the answer to her dreams and the situation that fate has bestowed upon her? The viewer is intrigued by these questions and the actors unravel the answers slowly and convincingly as they face events that challenge and shape their feeling towards each other.Once you have seen this film, like me you may want to see it again. I still have to work out the director's psychological motive for the sub plot in the role of the parole officer and some of the subtle nuances of camera work are worth a second look. The plot does ask for a little imagination when our hero is given a chance to assist our misused and overworked heroine in the office. You must also be broad minded to believe in her brilliant lip reading and how some of the action falls into place. But if you go along for the thrilling ride with this example of French cinema at its best you will come out more than satisfied. Four stars out of five for me.

It's about a young woman's schemes for theatrical success and how she affects all the lives around here.The protagonist is Anne Baxter playing Eve Harrington. Celeste Holm, wife of playwright Hugh Marlowe sees her night after night outside the theater where Bette Davis is starring in her husband's play. Eve tells a sad tale of woe to Bette, Celeste, Hugh, and director Gary Merrill once she's admitted into the star's inner sanctum. The only one who's skeptical is Bette's maid Thelma Ritter. Baxter is admitted into Davis's entourage.Davis, Daxter, Holm, and Ritter all received Academy Award nominations, the first two for Best Actress and the latter two for Best Supporting Actress. The first three already had won awards so more than likely they canceled each other out in the voting. Davis and Baxter lost to Judy Holliday for Born Yesterday and Josephine Hull in Harvey beat out Holm and Ritter. But in many ways these may have been the career roles for all these players. Bette Davis made a comeback with this part of Margo Channing. She had left Warner Brothers the year before after a string of very forgettable post World War II films. Davis really was Margo Channing, a big star who was now getting on in years and refused to realize she could not play leading parts for too much longer. Bette had a whole lot of insight to bring to Margo.Anne Baxter had won a Best Supporting Actress Award for The Razor's Edge. But Eve Harrington is miles apart from the tragic Sophie. Sophie is a decent soul who through a tragic accident that claimed her husband and baby went completely bonkers. Eve is a cold and calculating little minx who sets her sights on stardom and she's not too scrupulous about what she has to do to attain it. Both parts show the depths of this very underrated actress.I've always thought Celeste Holm has always been ignored unfairly when people talk about All About Eve. She and George Sanders narrate the film in different spots because the film is told in flashback as Eve Harrington is being presented the Sarah Siddons Award. It's her perspective from which Eve and the rest of the characters are viewed. She's an essentially decent soul, not as ego driven as the others who make their living in the theater. Her life is in her marriage to Hugh Marlowe and it nearly is wrecked because she took pity on a waif outside a theater. Celeste is living proof of the old adage about no good deed going unpunished.All About Eve got a few awards though including the big one for being The Best Picture of 1950. Joseph Mankiewicz got his second Best Director Oscar, he had won the previous year for A Letter to Three Wives.And 1950 proved to be the high point of George Sanders career as he took home a Best Supporting Actor for that 'fishwife' theatrical columnist Addison DeWitt. He also that year stole Cecil B. DeMille's Samson and Delilah's with his portrayal of the Saran of Geza. In fact the Saran was a BC version of Addison DeWitt.Sanders is the only other person who sees Baxter for what she is besides Thelma Ritter. He turns out to be quite the investigative reporter and his confrontation with Baxter is the climax of the film. He's not a nice man, but that may make him the only one really equipped to deal with Baxter if she becomes successful.All About Eve hasn't aged a bit in 56 years. I'm not sure about not making films like this any more, but they sure don't write them like this. It's one film you dare not put the mute button on or go to the refrigerator because you'll miss some witty gem. They come pretty fast and furious.And yet for all the sophistication of the film, Margo and her circle aren't a bad bunch. Naive yes, when it comes to Eve, but this con woman takes advantage of the fact that people want to believe someone like Baxter when she tells her tale and they have good extincts.Fortunately none of their good deeds are permanently punished.

Perhaps The Exorcist has a slight advantage, though.First of all, whether it is a true story or not, it still has extremely strange circumstances surrounding the making of this movie.I think something like 13 people died during the making, the set burned down mysteriously (no one knows why, even to this day) as well as the crew being plagued with minor difficulties.I have heard conflicting view on whether or not the actual exorcism occurred, but I tend to believe that no matter how improbable, these sort of things do happen.Call me religious. Call me superstitious. That's just what I believe.Also, the acting is amazing. I know a lot of it is real, like the angered look on the mother's face when she gets slapped across the room, and the frightened look from the Regan when she is flipping out on the bed. The are REAL emotions the actors went through, because they were being pulled too violently (in both cases) by the men who were pulling the ropes for 'special effects' behind them.However, whether you, yourself believe in the above mentioned things or not, this is not a forgettable film whatsoever. My recommendation is to watch it either completely alone or with one other person at the most in a pitch-black environment. If you aren't freaked out and\/or if your jaw is not dropped open by the end of the film, then I'll know you're watching it from a little cell in an unknown prison, Charles Manson.

Although the movie goes by the name of Leatherface; he has not that much chainsaw action or memorable sequences. In fact, his look has little to do with the one from the previous TCM movies. Sure, he has his good amount of kill scenes, and even a cheesy scene featuring a spelling machine for kids but there isn't enough Leatherface on-screen time. Leatherface even gets his own song, trailer, and more. He even gets a brand new, spectacular, memorable big shinny yellow chainsaw. That's a chainsaw I would even like to use. But I would praise director Jeff Burr for continuity details. For example, Leatherface has an electronic device in his right leg; following the ending of the original TCM. And some other little details that you will find about. The new characters have a different personality but are obviously inspired by The Cook and Chop-Top. But still each of the new characters are really likable and their personal features are to dig about. The little girl steals the show with her sadistic behavior. Ken Foree reprises his role from Dawn Of The Dead with a few differences. He does not wear a soldier outfit (although at some point he is asked by a girl if he's a soldier!), and he does not have a powerful weapon. He changes army glamour for old Texas country music and primitive fighting style. Heck, the man gets beaten by almost every member of the Saywer family, he gets a chainsaw through his skull, and other things but he manages to survive. Not even the zombies from the Romero 1978 masterpiece were able to keep him down. Foree delivers a great performance as the badass lead. Jeff Burr does a great job as director. He creates tension, unsettling atmosphere, and violence in most of the scenes. He has a good vision and demonstrates it. Leatherface is a dark movie with great direction and fast pacing. Talking about the movie's pace; I think it's decent enough because it goes directly to the point and covers the basic aspects a Horror movie needs to have. There's a decent amount of great gore, action, and tension sequences. Great job. The torture sequences were greatly done.Now, this movie is heavily underrated and has been critizied for it's part III label. Give it a try. You won't regret. Recommended for TCM fans or Horror followers overall. It's not just another slasher flick although some cheesy lines and scenes pop-up. For example why do you do this to us? Because he have to eat. Have you ever heard about pizza??!. Gee. The movie starts as the other Massacre movies. You know, people on their car have the bad luck to stop at the Last Gas Station and that's when everything starts. A couple who is on their way to Florida stops there and suddenly are insulted and spied (who will understand later) by Alfredo; and there they meet Tex; a Texas cowboy. Little they know that they perform a fake act in order to lead them to the infamous death route that always ends in the Saywers house. On the road, they are attacked by Leatherface, they crash their car against a black rude man with a horrible attitude but with a good heart named Benny, and they find their fatal fates. Not the trip they planned huh? Join the couple, the black tough guy, and the favorite cannibal family in the ultimate Chainsaw movie. This is how a Horror movie from the 90's should be.

He should know. He wrote *Tommy*. The film, *Tommy*, inspired by The Who's 1969 concept album &#150; about a traumatized deaf, dumb and blind boy who becomes a pinball-playing savior &#150; is simultaneously an electrifying musical monolith and a descent into drug-induced kookiness. Someone had to be high to let Oliver Reed sing. Blame eccentric satyr director, Ken Russell, whose hallucinogenic vision puts the higher in Messiah, jamming the movie with images of sensual nightmare showgirls in gasmasks, bombers-as-crucifixes, a skeleton with a snake-as-penis, giant pinballs littering the landscape, and Ann-Margret lolling in chocolatey, syrupy goodness.Oliver Reed is the nightmare part. Playing Tommy's stepfather, he excels at his forte (acting) but his painfully off-key ululations, combined with Ann-Margret's melodramatic cheese-vibrato (as Tommy's mum) make the film's early segments nigh unbearable. The creation of Viagra can be traced directly to the scene of Reed getting ready to bed down with Ann-Margret. Responsible for more erectile dysfunction than prostate problems or testicular cancer combined, that scene still sends a shudder of horror through my supple thighs. When the real rock musicians enter the fray, the film suddenly finds its feet. During Sonny Boy Williamson's *Eyesight to the Blind* - the first actual rock track - Eric Clapton is The Hawker Priest, The Who his acolytes, with Crazy Arthur Brown giving communion, under the graven image of Marilyn Munroe. Oh, sweet Blasphemy!An indefinable verve is captured on screen when real musicians mime their own instruments and vocals, which actors-playing-musicians could never hope to achieve Entwistle's fingers clearly ravage the bass fretboard, as Townshend smacks down his Les Paul and Clapton bleeds the blues. Tina Turner burns it down with her crazy-eyed Acid Queen and Elton John (in arguably the best re-arranged song for the movie) plies his big-booted pinball wizardry, while Keith Moon eats riotous scenery as a leering lecher. But it is when Roger Daltrey opens his mouth as the adult Tommy that the film finds its wings as a bird of prey. In his first on screen role, The Who's lead singer, Daltrey &#150; whose vocal timbre and awe-inspiring, full-bodied delivery simply bespeaks rock superstardom &#150; single-handedly elevates the film from an average musical to a legendary rock opera. As soon as that shirt comes off, he is the personification of Rock God. Thirty years after the film's release, his long-haired, bare-chested, tight-panted visage is still an icon of rock rebelliousness.The stirring final track (*Listening To You*) sees him bare-footed and bare-chested, climbing a mountain, in full-throated passionate song, more than ever resembling that which the rock opera itself tries to deconstruct &#150; a savior. The messages may be in the music, but even writer-composer Townshend would not be able to reconcile the paradoxes inherent in those messages. Throughout this magnum opus, though Townshend exhorts not to place faith in media-engined, merchandised entities, his own rockstar livelihood relies on the music-buying public doing just that. Even as his messages denounce those who would blindly worship icons, in creating this scintillating monument to rock, he himself becomes an icon to be worshipped. Maybe when the album and band were in their infancy and walking an unknown path between ephemerality and longevity, *Tommy* needed to make sense. With Townshend's concepts morphing constantly during the writing, recording and eventual filming of *Tommy*, he would never adequately explain it, but nowadays he does not need to. *Tommy* has achieved transcendence, as much a part of human culture as death and spam. There are allusions to Oedipus, The New Testament and even nods to *Beneath the Planet of the Apes* (Holy Bombs as graven images).*Tommy* the movie propelled *Tommy* the album back to No.2 on the Billboard charts, six years after its initial release. Townshend once said about performing *Tommy* The Rock Opera live, All I remember from that tour was Roger's chest.Townshend dedicated the *Tommy* album to his Indian spiritual mentor, Meher Baba. Thankfully keeping the lyrics free of mystical raving, profundities can be found passim You've been told many times before \/ Messiahs pointed to the door \/ But no one had the guts to leave the temple. Each one of you has freedom \/ In your heart, without my grace. But oft-times the hokeyness bleeds through in *We're Not Gonna Take It*, Tommy instructs his legions to simulate his Unaware state by plugging their ears, mouth and eyes, to attain enlightenment by effectively freeing their senses from the distractions of the world, then singing that Pinball completes the scene &#150; Huh? Of course! The eternal correlation between pinball and nirvana&#133; The traumatic deadening of Tommy's senses can also be applied to any society. How often we close our eyes and minds to the truth, because those in charge tell us with no uncertainty You didn't hear it, you didn't see it \/ You won't say nothing' to no one \/ Never tell a soul what you know is the truth!Only the epic finale touches upon any kind of inexplicable epiphany, yet is more than enough immortality for Townshend never to have to compose another tune Listening to you, I get the music \/ Gazing at you, I get the heat \/ Following you, I climb the mountain \/ I get excitement at your feet&#133;Literally shouting it from a mountaintop, Tommy the son ends a story where his father began it years ago, and director Ken Russell ensures that the Messiah metaphors, the chintzy and great rock music, the stunning imagery, the insightful themes will all take a backseat to this last scene's smoldering idolatry.

When Michael Rennie comes down in his space craft, and tells the world that now that you have crated a new atomic energy !, Earth must now be watch, so they may not threaten other planets. This movie in my eyes, sets the tone how other movies of this type may be judged. It is a movie classic i believe, that will outlast all the others, even the ones of today. Robert Wise obviously saw what lies ahead in the future. I believe Mr. Wise eventually worked on the set of a Star Trek movie later, his experience or ideas were respected enough to be consulted. Even hough young adults would not appreciate this classic, but they must understand history plays an important part of the future. when i saw this movie as a young child, it was scary and believable. Patricia O'Neal did not think this movie would go very far, until after she saw the response form the audience. This movie will always be a ten.
