There are a lot of wholesome laughs and some serious drama. What we have here is a romantic comedy with a little twist.It is a cross between The Object of my Affection and an episode of Law and Order, but with more heart. When the movie is funny, then it is VERY funny. When it is dramatic, it is VERY emotionally driven.Madonna does an excellent job in her role; I don't see why people always want to disrespect her acting ability. Rupert Everett and the rest of the cast are also really good in their roles. The only flaws I have with the movie are in the first thirty minutes of the movie. In the movie's beginning, there is a real problem with poorly written dialogue. It makes it look as though the actors can't act, but it is solely a problem with the dialogue. Stick through it though, IT GETS BETTER THE FARTHER YOU GET INTO THE MOVIE. Give it a chance. I think you will be pleased in the end.

Dylan Baker (who I had never heard of before) made a huge splash playing a psychiatrist father and also a compulsive pedophile.  It's heartbreaking and disturbing to see him struggle with his understandable guilt and also his uncontrolable longings.  Many may complain about the movie's sympathetic view of a pedophile but Baker makes Bill Mapplewood so human he seems like everyone we know.

But then there's Shanghai Surprise, Who's That Girl, Body of Evidence, and it just goes on. Add The Next Best Thing to that list.To her credit, Madonna really doesn't have much to work with in this film, with a script that spends too much time on the extraneous (the occasional mention of AIDS is irrelevant, as are the stilted attempts at showing Robert's tenuous relationship with his father) and never gets beyond skin-deep on the film's weightier issues. Rupert Everett is much more charismatic as Robert, best friend to Abbie (Madonna).The film's strongest moments are, quite understandably, when the script is also at its most realistic. An argument at the supermarket shows a rare hint of acting talent in Madonna. On the other hand, when the film slips into the highly unlikely it fails, as shown strongly in the film's final court scenes.Overall, the film does have some funny moments and isn't as bad as most critics would have you think.

Gattaca is probably the most underrated movie of all time. It's also very possibly my favorite, along with Dead Poets Society and The Shashank Redemption. The movie has absolutely no flaws whatsoever. Everything about the movie was so amazingly original. I was also blown away by the acting of it. I have tried to see every movie with Jude Law in it after seeing his exceptional performance in Gattaca. He is also such an unknown actor, but he's so talented (It's fantastic he's nominated for an Oscar for Talented Mr. Ripley). Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, and Alan Arkin also give such rich and excellent performances, too.The film is about Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke), who is born what now is the natural way, but in the future is uncommon. The natural way in the future is simply cloning a baby and letting the parents decide everything (gender, hair color, skin, personality) about the baby. Vincent has one simple goal to go into space, but because he's not valid and has a 99% chance of heart failure at the age of 30, Vincent can only find work as jobs like janitors. But one day, he finally goes to extreme measures to surpass the standards for a place called Gattaca where people train to become astronauts. He illegally changes his identity and borrows the identity of a superior clone by the name of Jerome Morrow (Jude Law), who is incredibly strong, but gets into an accident and paralyzes his legs. Jerome gives Vincent samples of his body to help him pass for his fake identity (blood samples, urine pouches, hair samples). Vincent is getting away with his illegal crime until a mission director is brutally murdered and a detective (Alan Arkin) finds Vincent's eyelash in a corridor, and when they find out that it is the eyelash of an invalid, the detective gets closer and closer at finding Vincent's true identity.Gattaca is a brilliant and stunning drama that I am completely outraged that it is such an unknown and underrated movie. It has such a fantastic script, such powerful performances, and an amazing music score that it definitely deserves recognition as a film that proves that the bounderies of science fiction are limitless.

Let me give you my frame of mind when I went in to Scream 3, the new film by Wes Craven and Ehren Kruger in the post-Williamson millennium. Soon after I saw Scream 2, I could not wait for Scream 3. At least once a week I would go to websites for the Scream trilogy looking for rumors for the third film. Yes, I know this is making my credibility fade away, but I'll keep going. For a while, there were many a rumor for the third installment of the extremely successful trilogy. Will Neve do it or not? Will Williamson write it or not? Will Christopher Walken be the killer? Come on, he HAS a cellphone. Will Sidney be an actress in Hollywood? Is Randy the killer? They never SHOWED him being stabbed. Yes, you know you heard some of these too. Okay MAYBE you haven't. Anyway. I could not wait. To me, THIS was my Star Wars prequel. People stood in lines for that, I couldn't wait for this. So when I walked out of Scream 3, the feeling I was left with wasn't so great. I couldn't tell what I thought of the movie. I had mixed feelings. How could I be objective? I thought. The following is the best I could do. Dimension Films had this movie so under-wraps that the only person in the film who got the whole script, was Courteney Cox Arquette (Gale Weathers) who had to sign a contract promising not even to reveal the ending to her husband, David (Dewey Riley). The script was printed on red lined paper making it IMPOSSIBLE to photocopy. The movie was being rewritten before it was even finished being written. There's buzz that Jenny McCarthy was mad because she had to learn three different sets of lines, and she didn't know which one was going to make the final cut. There were three different endings.

I did. What I got...wasn't what I wanted. It was like a bad Christmas gift. Now, enough background info. Onto my analysis. It's been two years since we've last seen the Woodsborro gang. (Really.) Gale Weathers has her own talk show entitled Total Entertainment. As does Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), who's show's title is so pun-ish that it hurts 100% Cotton. Cute. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has secluded herself away somewhere in California (away from LA where the movie takes place) and she's changed her name to Laura, while giving help to crisis victims (ironic). Dewey Riley is now working as a technical adviser on the set of Stab 3 Return To Woodsborro.  The actors working in Stab 3 are being killed off one by one by a psychotic killer (are there any other kind?) as they die in the script to Stab 3. We also learn a somewhat intriguing backstory to Maureen Prescott and her past before meeting Sidney's father. There's more to the plot, shockingly enough (shocking!), but here is where I'll stop, to keep the secrets from those who haven't seen it yet.I can't say that the acting is top notch, because come on! this is a horror movie. And besides, if I did, you'd probably commit me to a mental hospital. (Or refer me to Laura and her crisis center.) But, as usual, Schreiber was superb as Cotton. I loved his performance in Scream 2 and still here. He's one of Hollywood's best actors lately. I hope to see more from him (and no, I don't mean in movies like Sphere). There were cameos up the whatzoo. Matt Keeslar plays an actor playing Deputy Dewey Riley in Stab 3. (You with me here?) Parker Posey plays an actress playing Gale Weathers in Stab 3. (Confusing, right?) Emily Mortimer plays an actress playing Sidney. Patrick Dempsey plays a cop who is a little too into his job. Kevin Smith (Silent Bob from Clerks, Chasing Amy, Dogma and Mallrats) and Jason Mewes (Jay from the aforementioned four films) were taking a tour on Sunrise Studios' backlot. Carrie Fischer had a tongue in cheek cameo, that was almost hilarious. Kelly Rutherford and director Roger Corman have cameos as well. Scott Foley is brilliant as director Roman Bridger, who just wants to make a nice romantic comedy. Lance Henriksen plays a B horror movie director. Seinfeld's Patrick Warburton plays a professional bodyguard whose resume includes Julia Roberts. Even Jamie Kennedy had a cameo. (Which was my favorite scene in the movie. Where he explains the rules of a trilogy.) But there was a problem even with all this star power. The characters were one dimensional. And this leads to... ...Ehren Kruger. I don't think it was his fault, either. He put nothing into this movie because it wasn't his. He wrote it for the money (and what good money it was!). He was using Kevin Williamson's characters. I felt he never really got the chance to get a feel for them (he didn't have the time. Williamson procrastinated so long that Kruger had to write the screenplay extremely quick.) He structured a good thriller, but wasn't able to work out character development. Deon Richmond's character....what was his name? My point exactly. What was the point of the character? My point exactly.Wes Craven did what Wes Craven does best (or worst.) That's all I have to say about that. Dimension and everyone involved said that Scream 3 did NOT tone down it's violence due to the school shootings. I agree. It wasn't toned down. It was NONEXISTENT. There was not ONE truly scary scene in the movie. Not one death was gory. We saw no blood. We saw no elaboration. We saw a knife go into someone's back. Case closed. In fact, every time we saw the killer(s), it felt like watching a cartoon. The killer(s) didn't seem like a real person, an aspect that the Scream films have to pride themselves on. The killer(s) seemed like a figment of someone's imagination. (And I don't mean the writer's.) Speaking of the killer, I wouldn't dare tell who he\/she\/it\/they are, nor would I tell their motive. But in my opinion, like Scream 2's killers' motive, it wasn't fair. The killer(s) was(were) someone who's motive you never would have guessed because it wasn't brought up, hence, not being able to guess the person. As the trailer says, some secrets can never be revealed until the end. The end of this movie will leave you thinking He\/she\/they're the killer? So what? So what indeed. They promised us that Scr3am will be the last in the trilogy. No more after that. No way will there be a family worth of sequels like the Friday The 13th films or Nightmare On Elm Streets. They promised that the killer's motive in Scr3am will wrap up all questions about the first one. Yeah, it did. But what about the motives in Scre2m? There were plot holes everywhere in this movie. For instance, there's a very clever scene half way through the movie where the killer traps 5 characters in a house and sends a script they wrote via- a fax machine. The sent script tells you who the killer will grant mercy to and who the killer will kill. Now, like I said, this is a very clever scene. The killer cut the power to the house. With no power, how is the fax machine working? That's just one example of the miscrepancies in this movie. But oddly, I still liked it. Like I said, they promised us that there won't be any more Screams after this, but Scream 3 left the door right open for a sequel.

While Harry is a brilliant film with a  lot of energy and insight, it still leaves something of a bad taste; it feels at times like Allen's justification of the hard times he brought on his own family.  Perhaps he's come around, however.  In Sweet and Lowdown, Allen presents the boorish, insensitive artist as a man whose horrible, hurtful behavior ultimately hurts himself most of all.The story, told in a pseudo-documentary style, is about Emmett Ray (Sean Penn), a fictional 1930s jazz guitarist who would be the best in the world, if not for this gypsy in France, Django Reinhardt.  Ray is a true artist on the guitar with a genuinely light touch, but away from the stage, he's a train wreck (which makes sense, as one of his favorite hobbies, when he's not drinking, running whores, or shooting rats at the dump, is watching trains).  He is a man completely cut off from his feelings, who can not relate to people on any realistically sensitive level.  Then, he meets the one type of person such a man cannot properly handle  a woman who loves him unconditionally, flaws and all.  This is Hattie (Samantha Morton), a mute laundry girl who he uses for a time and then leaves.  He tries his hand at marriage with a pretentious would-be writer (Uma Thurman), but he finally realizes (even though he will not admit it to himself), that he left his true love behind when he left Hattie.  The loss finally ignites his art, and the only recordings he left behind are said to be easily as good as Reinhardt.As is always the case with an Allen film, the acting is quite good.  Penn is developing a DeNiro-like prowess for character transformations, and Emmett Ray is a nasty, cold man with one great gift to validate his existence.  Penn always looks at home with his guitar, and he handles the emotional retentiveness of Ray exceptionally well.  Morton, a surprise Oscar nominee, is truly fetching, with her sweet, open face and purity of spirit.  She's like a breath of fresh air.Woody Allen remains among my favorite directors of period-set films, because he always makes his worlds convincing without cramming them down my throat.  The film inhabits the '30s with such comfort that it's a real pleasure.  Major kudos to the costume designers for their wonderfully colorful array of outfits, and especially to Zhao Fei, who renders the film with an artfully burnished haze of nostalgia, giving the action the feel of a fondly recalled memory.  The music of course is wonderful, Dick Hyman coming through with some terrific arrangements of classic jazz tunes, and Harold Alden lilting the whole proceedings with his marvelous guitar playing.At first, the pseudodocumentary angle just did not work for me, but as I think more about the film, I realize that it is, on a small level, perfect.  Emmett Ray is a man whose life was altered by the love of a woman he ultimately wanted and could not have.  Allen (appearing as himself) comments that his final recordings really show a different side of Ray, a beautiful side.  Ray is best realized as a man who is forgotten except for those recordings, which were made after he had finally been opened up to his feelings, and who was thus able to do what Django had done.  It sometimes takes a lifetime of lowdown to create a moment of sweet, and that's what this film very sweetly suggests.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music"},{"date":"4 March 2000","score":"","review":"  A few weeks before seeing this film, I had a chance to take another look at Deconstructing Harry, a much different Woody Allen take on the subject of a man who's a genius at art, and an utter failure in life.  While Harry is a brilliant film with a  lot of energy and insight, it still leaves something of a bad taste; it feels at times like Allen's justification of the hard times he brought on his own family.  Perhaps he's come around, however.  In Sweet and Lowdown, Allen presents the boorish, insensitive artist as a man whose horrible, hurtful behavior ultimately hurts himself most of all.The story, told in a pseudo-documentary style, is about Emmett Ray (Sean Penn), a fictional 1930s jazz guitarist who would be the best in the world, if not for this gypsy in France, Django Reinhardt.  Ray is a true artist on the guitar with a genuinely light touch, but away from the stage, he's a train wreck (which makes sense, as one of his favorite hobbies, when he's not drinking, running whores, or shooting rats at the dump, is watching trains).  He is a man completely cut off from his feelings, who can not relate to people on any realistically sensitive level.  Then, he meets the one type of person such a man cannot properly handle  a woman who loves him unconditionally, flaws and all.  This is Hattie (Samantha Morton), a mute laundry girl who he uses for a time and then leaves.  He tries his hand at marriage with a pretentious would-be writer (Uma Thurman), but he finally realizes (even though he will not admit it to himself), that he left his true love behind when he left Hattie.  The loss finally ignites his art, and the only recordings he left behind are said to be easily as good as Reinhardt.As is always the case with an Allen film, the acting is quite good.  Penn is developing a DeNiro-like prowess for character transformations, and Emmett Ray is a nasty, cold man with one great gift to validate his existence.  Penn always looks at home with his guitar, and he handles the emotional retentiveness of Ray exceptionally well.  Morton, a surprise Oscar nominee, is truly fetching, with her sweet, open face and purity of spirit.  She's like a breath of fresh air.Woody Allen remains among my favorite directors of period-set films, because he always makes his worlds convincing without cramming them down my throat.  The film inhabits the '30s with such comfort that it's a real pleasure.  Major kudos to the costume designers for their wonderfully colorful array of outfits, and especially to Zhao Fei, who renders the film with an artfully burnished haze of nostalgia, giving the action the feel of a fondly recalled memory.  The music of course is wonderful, Dick Hyman coming through with some terrific arrangements of classic jazz tunes, and Harold Alden lilting the whole proceedings with his marvelous guitar playing.At first, the pseudodocumentary angle just did not work for me, but as I think more about the film, I realize that it is, on a small level, perfect.  Emmett Ray is a man whose life was altered by the love of a woman he ultimately wanted and could not have.  Allen (appearing as himself) comments that his final recordings really show a different side of Ray, a beautiful side.  Ray is best realized as a man who is forgotten except for those recordings, which were made after he had finally been opened up to his feelings, and who was thus able to do what Django had done.  It sometimes takes a lifetime of lowdown to create a moment of sweet, and that's what this film very sweetly suggests.

It has a tendency to leave you feeling quite disturbed and unsettled. This can be attributed mainly to the films last 15 minutes, wherein the lead character Harry Angel, a private investigator (played by Mickey Rourke), learns the emotionally devastating truth behind the case he has been working on.  Rourke is quite good throughout the entire movie, lending his character a certain sleazy-cool charm, but it is in the films last few moments that he shines best.  His harrowing display of pain in these scenes is so intense and believable that you truly feel his despair.  Robert De Niro who appears in only a few scenes (in a key role), also does good work. Now for the down side.  Director Alan Parker from the very beginning imbues his film with such a heavy atmosphere of impending doom that we hardly have a chance to breathe.  If he had perhaps lightened up a bit in those earlier scenes, the ending would have slowly crept up on us and been even more shocking and disturbing than it was.  Also he attempts to combine the horror and detective genres with only moderate success (especially in the later case).  What usually thrills us about classic film-noir detectives is their sarcastic wit and hip dialogue.  This verbal element is sorely lacking in ANGEL HEART, so the audience tends to latch onto the visual aspects of the investigation which are not enough to keep us totally riveted for the first two thirds of the film.  On occasion the director also loses his sense of subtlety and allows sex, blood and gore to steal the show (as in the bedroom scene with Rourke and Lisa Bonet).  The above complaints aside, ANGEL HEART is an unforgettable and haunting film which though not a totally pleasant experience, is still worth a look, especially if you like films dealing in psychological horror.Final Verdict   6 out of 10.
