Some people say it is horror,but it is not. This is a film about cruelty of modern civilization,where people mostly do not care of others and everyone watches his own business.Lady in a Cage is a story about modern society from a psycho-sociological point of view. This is not an action movie and you can not aspect too much from it.You just have to let it be what it is.This is everyday story of ordinary people with all their greed,selfishness and their personnel background. Mrs.Hilyard is possessive mother but not a dictator, she just does not know when enough is enough.She is helpless and probably wishes unconsciously his son to stay with her despite she is telling him to get married.He is desperate and just wants to be free,and obviously ready to do anything even if it means threatening to kill himself like he wrote in letter. Randall (played by James Caan) is a typical trash of society but his family and society made him be what he is. There is a conversation between Mrs.Hilyard and him when she says to him that ordinary tax-payers like herself pay money so that state can feed people like him in prisons. Those two are opposites-she represents everything that he hates. She reminds him on his grandmother who used to control him when he was kid. He says about his grandmother while putting a knife to Mrs.Hilyards neck-I would kill her,if she did not die. There is another difference between them-Mrs.Hilyard is rich and Randall is poor and that intensifies his hatred about her, so he wants to steel as more as he can from her house. But he loses all of that when Mr.Pauls men arrive and grab everything and we see him beaten by them. There is always someone stronger and tougher-the Law of the Jungle. Elaine and Essie are just Randalls puppets.They do everything he tells them and sometimes enjoy in doing so,even when they kill George, a scum who arrived there first. They also wanted to kill Sade a whore who came with George and Mrs.Hilyard to leave no witness, but they failed. They payed price of their greed and as they said there is a hot chair in this state for them. Story comes to an end when Mrs.Hilyard stabs Randall in his eyes and he gets blinded,soon he gets killed by a car on the street-the most shocking scene in all of the movie.People finally find Mrs.Hilyard after she released herself from cage like elevator and when everything is over as usual.We do not know what happened to her son-movie leaves us wondering did he kill himself or not? It is on us to make our own conclusions. But what is the point of this movie that some viewers understood very well and some misunderstood completely? This is our materialistic society and civilization with all of its destructiveness. Like in Erich From book The anatomy of human destructiveness, as more technologically advanced is,civilization is more destructive. There is a scene in movie when Mrs.Hilyard thinks that someone pushed the button and dropped the bomb. She thinks on nuclear war of which people were afraid back in that time (just remember Cuban- missile crisis in 1962). In modern society lots of people are alienated despite of their success and wealth (Mrs.Hilyard is mostly alone),others are pushed on the edge as nus products (Randall and his gang,George,Sade and others) and there is high crime rate as a result of that. I am afraid of how it is going to be in a future when it was like that in past and the same (if not worse) is now. Is it going to get worse or better? Nobody hears Mrs.Hilyard ringing for help endlessly,everyone went on vacation.Nobody cares. Attention of people is attracted only on the end when they face the horror (blinded Randall on the street gets killed by a car and Mrs.Hilyard yelling for help). But when everything is over,endless line of vehicles proceeds further. People who were interrupted for a moment go to their direction,life goes on,civilization keeps functioning like nothing happened. Just another day in a big city.

If you don't like Titanic, that's your loss and you're missing out on an amazing movie. The love between Jack and Rose is something we all wish we had, unfortunately it doesn't happen very often. Although Jack died after Titanic sank, Rose carried his promise for the rest of her life. He is the reason why Rose lived her life. The chemistry between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet is so strong and Kate really holds this movie together. I honestly have no words to say about them, just amazing.Titanic did outstanding at the box office mostly because of Leonardo DiCaprio. The first couple of times I watched the movie, I do admit I liked it because of Leo and the love story between Jack and Rose. As the years passed, I started seeing the movie for what it is. I became extremely interested in the real disaster and started to like the movie even more. Leo is still one of the reasons why I love Titanic but not the only reason. The graphics are outstanding. It's hard to believe it was only 1997. If you watch carefully, you can tell which scenes are computer generated but overall this movie has outstanding graphics. James Cameron made the sinking of the Titanic so horrific, he did such an amazing job, the movie couldn't have been done better and the score, James Horner made the best piece of music for any movie I've ever seen. Watching what everyone went through during the sinking gets to me every time. The breaking of the glass dome, passengers sliding down the decks as the ship is in the air, the ship breaking in half, falling on top of the passengers is just unbelievable. I tear up every single time I watch it. You can't imagine what it would have been like the night Titanic really sank unless you were there and James Cameron did the best possible job I've seen trying to portray that image.Critics and viewers wonder why Titanic focuses on a love story. Love is the one thing that attracts people to seeing a movie. The star of the movie is really the ship but Cameron also wanted part of the story to focus on a love story between a first class and third class passenger. He wanted 2 main stars of the film but also wanted viewers to understand the Titanic and feel for what happened during that fateful night. Cameron wanted the movie to focus on a love story because it is one that attracts women to the theatre, in some cases guys. The love he portrays in this movie is one you don't find very often and is a good example because back in 1912 third class passengers and poor people were most often not accepted into society. There were either really rich people or really poor. In Titanic, he shows that you can fall in love with someone, not for how poor they are but for personality and accepting them the way they are. Rose is someone you can easily fall in love with. For me, she is my favorite character in the film, besides Jack and Mr. Andrews. Her character grows throughout the movie and you learn she's not like most first class passengers. Some first class see poor people as scum and don't care about them. Rose is completely different. She grew up in the rich world and was set up to marry someone who was wealthy because her father passed and her mother was in debt. Rose wasn't happy the way she was living and wanted to commit suicide. She was trapped in a world she didn't want to live in. She wanted to be free, see the world and live the life she wanted. Nobody around her saw that and was expected to marry a wealthy man so her mother could be free of debt. Jack then comes in, saves her life and later begins to fall in love with him because he has what she wants, to live free, be independent and not care what others think. Jack made her promise to move on, no matter what happened. He loved her more than his own life and in the end, I think he did know to some extent that he wouldn't survive so he wanted Rose to promise to survive and live her life. Cameron did an amazing job of portraying their love in the movie.You can decide on the ending for yourself, whether Rose is sleeping or she passed away. I've always thought that she passed away and reunited with Jack, showing everyone in the room who died the night Titanic sank.Titanic got some poor reviews from critics and from a lot of viewers but nothing anyone says about this movie can change my love for it. I actually like the entire movie, probably one of the only ones that actually likes the first half. It's amazing how after 12 years Titanic is still the highest grossing movie ever made, holding almost $ 2 billion at the box office. Titanic will always be one of the most inspiring and important movies ever made. There won't be another movie for a long time that will beat Titanic's record.In all honesty, I've seen Titanic more than 200 times. I was 9 years old when I first watched it and have loved it ever since.I could write paragraphs and paragraphs but it will never truly express how much I love Titanic.

It's also a story about human nature featured by the strange friendship that arises between the infiltrated agent(who has sometimes to behave like one of the so called wise men of the Mafia gang) and the member who acts as his protector and also featured by the familiar problems of these two prominent characters;for the infiltrated agent (performed by Johnny Depp) because he has got to stay out of home for long periods which annoys his wife very much and even puts his marriage at risk; for the petty Mafia member because he has severe problems with his son who is a drug addict. The second half of the movie is somewhat weaker than the first one since it's more about the conspiracies of the gang and the ensuing gunfights and killings than about the psychological analysis of characters shown through their actions and words. Anyway it's still a good movie, well directed and well acted by everyone.

Conchita is likewise attracted to Mathieu... except it's not clear if she's just using him and leading him along, or if she honestly just wants assurance that his feelings are pure. In other words, Mathieu is the loving abuser and Conchita is literally the emphasis on the prude\/slut dichotomy. AAAnd so you get to watch them, for two hours, nearly destroy each other in basically one of the best dysfunctional relationships ever put on screen.Lots has been said about the two actresses playing Conchita.

Perhaps due to the fact, that every sequel was made by another great director and had another Ripley character growing more and more adapt to the superhuman forces involved here. And that there was some kind of development of the alien species. Perhaps also due to the co-production of S.Weaver, who might protect her Sgt. Ripley against decay.Alien is hard SF and hard SF is about possibility alone, neither about reality as the crime genre nor about myth as fantasy and horror. It is not at all the task of SF-authors to make real predictions - do you think they'd not work as engineering inventors or in policy, should they be capable of that ? No SF classic describing a nearer future as 1984, Brave New World, 20.000 miles under the sea has come only near to reality.That is why hard SF is about possibilities. And the reader\/spectator has to accept superluminal transit, for example. Attempts to fill the gap must inevitably fail by the missing scientific qualifications of the authors. In Solaris the alien is sending tormenting hallucinations to men - so far no problem - and Stanislav Lem tries to elaborate them as neutrino bundles. That is ridiculous - in my view the only flaw of this masterpiece, but a severe.Fortunately there is nothing like neutrino bundles in Alien 4. But unfortunately there are essentials of the plot too far from possibility. To pick out only one The DNS Ripley 4 is made from could not have withstood the heat of the fumace in Alien 3. At the good end the plot has a marvellous outline and the length of IMDb's quote list proves the quality of the dialogue. A good part of its laconic humour comes from Ripley 4's alien nature and is quite appropriate. Nevertheless these holes are the main reason for me not to give a 10.Slightly off-topic For me Alien 1 is fine, but the poorest of the series.

Steve McQueen's unflappable, detached businessman who loves his pleasures (from liquor to women to dune buggies) is played perfectly. He's not a sympathetic character at first, but you come to appreciate him, if not love him, and want him to get away with things. Success on his terms is a kind of defiance against the dullness of life, so we can relate. Faye Dunaway, when she comes in, is easily his equal, quick and coy in ways that fit perfectly with his.The plot is carefully delineated, and interesting, but it becomes just background after awhile, as does the police investigation. What matters is how the Dunaway character proceeds, breaking rules and breaking through. She's a great paradigm of a 1960s woman, liberated and smart but still all female in the usual clichés. I suppose McQueen is a kind of 1960s playboy himself, but he comes off as less fun and less elevated (and more selfish) than, say, Sean Connery's Bond character.There are some stylistic things to enjoy, like the sophisticated split screens. Starting with the opening credits and continued between scenes throughout is a creative dividing of the screen into several frames, sometimes showing two or three scenes, and with a whole range of different combinations and shapes. It sounds distracting or affected, but it works really well for this kind of cool, clean movie. And the music, up front and a hair heavy handed at times (by Michel Legrand), emphasizes style and chic over realism.Norman Jewison, the director, has had an odd career, stellar at moments, but always emphasizing artifice. The Russians are Coming the year before this is a perfect example, also empty but perky. Or the musicals that follow (like Jesus Christ Superstar). I think all of these are worth watching if you have the slightest interest in the period, in the way movies had to shift to wider moral scopes as well as to an audience hungry for innovation (and tired of t.v.). But if you really want a look at stylized crime movies from this period at their best, you'd be better off starting with Klute or Point Blank (the first version). Both are terrific. Thomas Crown lacks any one great thread to make it click&#x97; the script is routine, the acting reasonable but never sparkling (Dunaway does her best). The filming (Haskell Wexler) and the editing (Hal Ashby, yes!) are standouts in their own ways. It's a period piece, odd to say (being that it's so mod in its airy 1960s cool). If all this careful, designerly perfection wears you down, that's understandable.

I think he's a great actor and played his part really well, a volcanologist who checks out the town, convinces his boss Dreyfus that the town should be on alert and wants to protect the citizens of Dante's Peak and even forms a relationship with the mayor, Rachel Wando and eventually becomes fond of her children Lauren and Graham. I'm not too fond of Linda Hamilton but she plays well in this film.Dante's Peak and Volcano were released the same year (1997) but Dante's Peak did better at the box office. I couldn't really get into Volcano, even after seeing it countless numbers of times. Dante's Peak is more accurate, unlike Volcano. The director wanted to bring in real volcanologists for Dante's Peak to make scientific accuracies. They thought the film would sell better by adding these scientific accuracies and show the audience what would really happen during an eruption. Now, I've seen a lot of comments about how there are tons of mistakes in Dante's Peak. No movie is perfect and they're not going to add every single accuracy into a movie. They are allowed to approach the film however they want too. The pyroclastic cloud at the end is what really gets to me when I watch this film. Every time I watch it, when Dalton is driving away from the pyroclastic cloud, I always think for a minute they aren't going to make it, even though I know what's going to happen.

One not sorted with skeletons locked in bricked over closets, but one with a wounded heart. Even so he continues onward, undaunted. Unshaken. Steadfast.Prior to his adventure Godfrey spends his time with other men who have been the unfortunate victims of the bucket-shop mentality and the ensuing stock market crash. With no finances, no family, and fewer friends, he and others pool their resources, and makes a go of it exchanging philosophical heart to hearts and other truths with fellow forgotten men in the shanty towns that sprung up in 1930s America.Enter the blonde. Carol Lombard's character is naive but loving. To her the world is something to be enjoyed, and the people in it something to be cherished, if not played with in a very loving way. She comes across the tall stranger who, with all the trappings of an impoverished human, stands tall with dignity. His wealth is not in fiduciary concerns, but in his character. The gold that he holds is in his heart, not his wallet. Lombard's Bullock sees this on an instinctive and spiritual level. It is a connection that true lovers the world over know and feel.But Godfrey's hurts are deep. He does not let anyone see it, not show it. He keeps his reserve and comport to the public, though risks some brazenness in his privacy when he can afford it. He is a man of honor, but like a Greek hero is not above guile as a means of defense.Godrey is the kind of man that used to hail from the dawn of civilization, but to which has been forgotten in a day and age of pre-adolescent social norms. The high profile man of today is an aggressive teenager, with like tastes in popular culture. Today it is the Carlo who permeates the world as the desirable male icon. From law enforcement, to the sports' fan, to the investment banker, to the concert goer, to the grocery store checker. The Gen-Nexter has everything in common with Godfrey that a house fly has with a jumbo jet Both fly, both are aerodynamically sound, but, the jet, unlike the fly, neither subsist on piles of dung nor annoys in its attention getting as does the Gen-Next male.In our day and age Godfrey wrongfully be labeled as effete or homosexual; i.e. having knowledge of culture, but refusing to act like a boor all the while retaining his personal pride.

Oh, and Gary Cooper.Hollywood in the 1940s was never particular about these niceties. A foreign accent was a foreign accent.

Except that Hemingway was always difficult to transpose to film. His best passages -- those pebbles in the clear stream; the frozen carcass of the leopard on Mount Kilmanjaro -- tended to be descriptive. His dialog, sometime very funny, could also be very purple, ultra violet even, and those seemed to be the particular pieces of dialog that appealed to writers and producers. Here we're stuck with Ingrid Bergman's first kiss. Where do the noses go?

Go and we go together. But if you stay, we don't go, so we don't go together. (Something like that.) At least he doesn't say, Forget about me. Save yourselves. And we're also spared, from the novel, the observation that when Cooper and Bergman have sex, the earth moved. Hemingway had a fable about dealing with Hollywood.

He's handsome and virile; he manages to activate both facial expressions, and it fits the part.

Charlton Heston plays Mexican narcotics detective Mike Vargas. When he witnesses an apparent murder at the U.S.-Mexico border, he becomes wrapped up in a case headed by grouchy American expert police detective Hank Quinlan (Welles). Vargas is a cop full of integrity, but Quinlan has a Machiavellian sense of justice. The two are at odds from the very start. Quinlan carries enough weight with the police force to influence their judgment, and Vargas gets suspicious.Meanwhile, Vargas's wife (Janet Leigh) keeps falling into the traps set for her by a gang of greasers from a Mexican mob family. Vargas sent the mob boss to jail and now the rest of the family aims to get even. Vargas makes the boneheaded mistake of leaving his vulnerable wife alone time after time.EVIL is a very well-crafted film. Orson Welles sure knew how to tell a story on film. Every line is important. Everything has a purpose.Many scenes have multiple layers. More than one thing going on. Something in the foreground and something else in the background, or overlapping lines of dialogue, or interesting juxtapositions of images. Welles, as usual, provides some interesting visuals, using mirrors and shadows and other auteur tricks.The film is also full of bits of humor. One-liners and small gags. Uncle Joe, the acting leader of the Grandi mob family, often reminded me of Boris Badenov (even though he was Mexican). As the movie goes on it becomes more serious and intense.There are no opening titles or credits, so I wasn't aware of who the major players were. Charlton Heston is done up to look Mexican, with darker skin and a moustache. All movie long I was going crazy trying to figure out who the actor was. I knew I knew him. Something about the teeth... I was kicking myself when the end credits popped up. I felt so stupid. I did recognize the lovely Janet Leigh as Heston's wife, but I missed a cameo by Zsa Zsa Gabor.An older, heavier Welles is fun to watch as the veteran police chief forced into a downward spiral. The rest of the actors do a good job and Henry Mancini's score is effective throughout.As a viewer, you never quite know what's really going on. Who's with whom, who did what. You have some ideas, but you're not sure. Was it a frame job? A cover-up? Was he in on the whole thing? Is the murder linked with the harassment of Mrs. Vargas? Are they gonna get away with it?

But if you somehow can forget the existence of The Exorcist (1973) you may like The Heretic. I know that that it is too much to ask or to pretend but it's the only way possible I can think of in order to enjoy or understand the movie. The first time I saw it I didn't understand nothing because I kept thinking about the events of the original movie. You know what I mean. How come the writers never mentioned the character of father Karras??? he was the one who actually saved Regan. And why the movie is called The Heretic?? Who commit heresy? Father Merrin?? Why??

I thought of the movie as a supernatural drama instead of a horror one, because, to be honest, it never scared me(except for the part when they are trying out the synchronizer and the possessed Reagan appears). Another reason why I liked this movie was because Louise fletcher was here and she's one of my favorite actresses and her character as Dr Gene Tuskin was the best performance of the movie, in opposition to that of Richard Burton and Linda Blair, who were ridiculous and annoying but... hey, it's not their fault, remember?

Overall, I'm glad I did. Awakenings is a sincere and moving account of a true episode in which several patients in (for want of a better phrase) a near-vegetative state) awoke from their condition after being administered L-Dopa, a wonder drug used in the treatment of Parkinson's Disease. All things considered, it's quite a surprise that Hollywood took more than 20 years to make a film about it.There's plenty of room for over-sentimentality here, but for the most part director Penny Marshall and writer Steve Zaillan manage to sidestep the obvious pitfalls, straying only occasionally into Hollywood schmaltz. Robert De Niro delivers a convincing performance as Leonard, the middle-aged man who lapsed into this vegetative state when he was 20-years-old after suffering encephalitis as a child. Robin Williams tones down his manic persona for the role of the shy doctor who brings about this miracle cure - and given that he couldn't have been an obvious casting choice he does extremely well.Although it avoids overt sentimentality, the film does contain some typical Hollywood touches which, given the nature of the story, may be unavoidable. For example, people who haven't spoken or moved freely for 30 years are able to speak and move with little difficulty while in reality they would, like coma patients, need months of physio and speech therapy. But unless, like me, you're naturally cynical about the amount of truth contained in 'based on a true story' films, this can be written off as nit-picking on my part I suppose.
