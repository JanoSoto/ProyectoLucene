I remarked in my first viewing that the film attains a unique eerie quality exactly because so much of it is missing. Heresy! More on that in a little while.This was an important time for Welles. The debacle is well documented elsewhere, but a few words for my benefit. He was in Brazil when it happened, doing It's All True and women. For the past few months, Welles had been juggling three projects at once. Filming Ambersons by day, indirectly shaping Journey to Fear by night, originally intended for him to direct, and preparing to embark on the Brazilian adventure for the government at the behest of Rockefeller. A composite print including music was finalized on the run, in the Miami studio where Popeye cartoons were made. The voice-over was recorded overnight by Welles exhausted from a Washington trip. A few days later, he was on a boat to Rio.So it was all or nothing. It was nothing. A butchered Ambersons was dumped in a few LA theaters and forgotten. Journey was similarly botched. It's All True was abandoned. He was effectively fired from his job. Hollywood would have nothing to do with him, still bitter over the Kane contract and the man's ambitions. It was revelling time as the privileged youth was getting his comeuppance.Now the film was conceived on the scope and innovation of Kane, but that version - 132m - is already myth. A print of that version, probably the Miami print, was sent down to Welles in Rio for revisions. Did Gonzaga, of Rio's Cineda company where Welles was working on It's All True, destroy that print as per the imperative of RKO's New York office? There is at least one report from Cineda that the cans of film were still in existence by the mid-50's.For the foreseeable future, we have this. A curious thing happens here that I believe opened portals for narrative. That wasn't going to take off until fresh eyes saw reruns of the film in the 1960's TV. Welles himself wasn't going to see the film again until that time.At the time, it was bleakly received. Too bleak for wartime. A few flaws persist to this day; Tim Holt is an onedimensional whine, Aunt Fanny's scenes are hysterical, the reshot finale is atrocious.A handful of people perhaps recognized what it was all about; it was Kane with a big qualitative difference. It was also about childhood loss but more somber, less precocious. It was every bit as autobiographical as Kane, but this Kane never tried to shape the world to his image. It was about time and beautiful things vanishing, thought to be beautiful when they were young. It was about dual worlds at crossroads.The famous story goes, that Welles was in Bogdanovich's LA home one night when the film came up on TV, it must have been the early 70's, so when Welles was puzzling about a modern narrative in film. We've yet to see his response, which I presume is tucked inside The Other Side (until then, we have F For Fake). That film was about an aging filmmaker reminiscing about a life in movies, that much we know. So the film comes up and this aging filmmaker immediately flicked the channel. His company insisted they sit down and watch the film. Welles left the room in a huff, but a little while later came back and quietly sat down and they did watch. According to Bogdanovich, Oja Koddar nodded to him that Orson was crying.It was not the brutal treatment of the film at the hands of philistines, relates Henry Jaglom from a later chat with Welles, that just made him mad. The tears were for bygone times.The film was, at the heart of it, a grown man's lament about a world that came apart before he could hold onto any part of it, a world that Welles intimately knew and cherished from his own childhood and probably correctly assumed was written by Tarkington around him and his mother. It's about a story that collapses around the protagonist. Now it's safe to presume that Welles' version would have fleshed everything a bit more, sketched transitions a little clearer. Fractured memory but with a clear design, like he had done in Kane. Enter RKO. In most eyes, the last third that is the most clearly botched part of the film is hideous. I see a more peculiar effect at work; instead of the collapse given to us in ordinary terms, with a dramatic weave, the actual film is falling apart before our eyes. It's shattering left and right. The solid floor of the story is suddenly concave. Anchors that made the world coherent are pulled out and in rapid succession. This is the most clear in just two scenes, Major Ambersons monologue before the fireplace and cut to the mother's death as a single hallucinatory flow of the camera.It feels choppy as you watch it, because it was not intended and you can clearly tell parts are missing. But the notion has tremendous power.It involves narrative structure on the backend of us splicing it together. The film empties of images as the man does. We know there is more to it - finer shades - but just can't know, can't remember a thing beyond impressions, beyond snippets of memory.Welles, at the time, was a dramatist blessed with a keen visual eye, putting cinematic 2 and 2 together using story-space.

It's subtraction from reasonable causality that we assume works in life but most of the time doesn't, so that mostly space remains floating with the essence of broken bits.

Like Jim Henson's 1982 film, The Dark Crystal, this is a puppet fantasy film (though some humans appear in this one), but I didn't see the first film of the two that much while growing up, and now that I have seen it more than once within the past couple years, I have to admit, while many like it, I don't. However, watching Labyrinth again twice in the past couple years, my first viewings in probably nearly a decade at least, was different, in a good way. I now see more flaws in the film than I used to back in the day, but it certainly hasn't completely lost its charm.Sarah is a fifteen-year-old girl with a strong passion for fantasy and fairy tales. One night, her father and stepmother leave her to babysit her baby half-brother, Toby. Soon after they leave, Sarah is annoyed by Toby's non-stop crying, and after saying some lines from Labyrinth, one of the books she likes, she says she wishes the goblins would come and take him away! Soon after she says this, she sees that Toby is no longer in his crib! She meets Jareth the Goblin King, and realizes what she has done! The goblins really have taken the baby boy, and he will become one of them in thirteen hours unless Sarah makes it through a labyrinth to their castle in time! So, the teenager then begins her trek, and learns that the labyrinth is very dangerous and complex! Jareth will only make it harder for her! The main character, Sarah, played by Jennifer Connelly (one of her early film roles), is unfortunately a bit of an absurd one. A fifteen-year-old getting all worked up over a baby taking her teddy bear?! She can be maybe a tad irritating at times, and Connelly doesn't put on a very good performance in the role, which makes the film lose points. Fortunately, this only occasionally drags the film down, and there's enough to make up for that one character. On the journey, Sarah meets a number of likable and sometimes humorous puppet characters, and finds herself in some fascinating places. The humour is sometimes perhaps a little too kiddish, but I still got a good number of laughs from it. The 1986 fantasy flick also contains suspense and appropriate music for it. Rock star David Bowie as Jareth the Goblin King is another highlight, and so are some of the songs he contributed to the film.This Jim Henson project tanked at the box office, but fortunately, since then, it seems to have turned out to be one of those films which has gained a strong cult following since its box office failure, and I certainly can't question why! Although by no means perfect, Labyrinth is a decent fantasy film, directed by Jim Henson and co-written by Henson, poet Dennis Lee, and Terry Jones of Monty Python fame! With all the puppets and sets, it obviously took a lot of effort and a lot of people to make this movie, many people who deserve a lot of credit, and their hard work paid off!

I am surprised at the negative response so many have claiming that it is anti-feminist blah blah blah or that it is a comedy with no substance. On the contrary, I find 'Holy Smoke' to be a provocative piece full of substance.The refreshing novel concept is pretty daring and Campion balances both dark humour and intensity. She tackles various relevant themes such as respect and care within the family (the mother is the only one who seems to be concerned about what happened to her daughter in India while the father is totally indifferent), sexual manipulation, spirituality vs brainwash, power control and so on. The viewer is totally absorbed on how the de-programmer 'saves' Ruth but things take unexpected turns and we start questioning who exactly this PJ Waters is. The relationship between PJ and Ruth gradually becomes reminiscent of that between Lolita and Humbert (from Kubrick's 'Lolita'). The dysfunctional family is portrayed in a funny light but the characters's (especially the women's) despair and struggle is evident such as Mom being concerned about her daughter and Yvonne who is unhappy with her sex life. Campion, with the help of the actors, creates this whole mysterious atmosphere through the characters. We are given some nice glimpses of the isolated dry Australian landscape.The performances are terrific. Kate Winslet, even though occasionally switches back to her own British accent, acts phenomenally. She already made a brave choice by choosing such a risky role and the actress just shows how comfortable she is in the skin of her character and mesmerizes the viewer. Harvey Keitel does nothing short of a fine job but he is obviously overshadowed by Winslet.

She tackles various relevant themes such as respect and care within the family (the mother is the only one who seems to be concerned about what happened to her daughter in India while the father is totally indifferent), sexual manipulation, spirituality vs brainwash, power control and so on.

I understand that the cinematography is good, acting is decent and overall the movie is OK, but Oscar for best movie, even before Fargo? Please!My main gripe is that it seems like a glorified one night stand. I am not criticizing this movie from a moral standpoint. I have no issues with people sleeping around. What bothers me most is that there was absolutely no effort by the director to develop the main characters of Ralph Fiennes (RF) and Kristin Scott Thomas (KST). RF is a wooden, dis- respectful loner and KST is a bored housewife. They spend a couple of days in desert and start sleeping around. I understand this. It can happen. But they are madly in love? Really? Why? What was it in RF's character that made KST's character to fall for him completely? Except many of those love scenes, I can't point a single instance where I felt that there was something happening between the two. It just felt that director was focusing so much on passion (read numerous one night - day - afternoon stands) that it seemed nonsensical. The only slightly likable character is that of Juliet Binoche as Hanna. Her acting is good. But she has been underutilized. And even in her case, her affection for the Sikh soldier (Naveen Andrews) seems so made up and fake.Why do two people fall in love with each other and remain in love till the end?

What the children do not realise, however, is that the game has strange, mysterious powers, and when Alan's token lands on a particular square he is suddenly sucked into the game. Unsurprisingly traumatised by the disappearance of her friend, Sarah runs out of the house shrieking, leaving the game unfinished.Twenty-six years later two more children, Peter and Judy, orphaned by the death of their parents in a car crash, move into the former Parrish family home with their Aunt Nora. They find the old Jumanji set and start playing the game; when Peter rolls a five Alan suddenly reappears, now a grown man. He explains to them that he has been trapped inside the game for the last twenty-six years and that they must now finish the game which he and Sarah started. This, however, is easier said than done. Not only must the children find Sarah and persuade her to take part, they must also cope with the magical effects of the game. Each roll of the dice results in strange happenings in keeping with the game's jungle adventure theme; animals such as lions, monkeys, elephants and rhinoceroses suddenly materialise and proceed to wreak havoc in the town. Just as deadly is a white hunter named Van Pelt who will take pot-shots at anything that moves, animal or human.The big-name star in this film is Robin Williams, although it also features a young Kirsten Dunst, later to become a big name herself. This isn't Williams' best role- I generally prefer him in his more serious films like Dead Poet's Society or Good Morning, Vietnam- but it's a lot better than many of his comedies, which can descend into either silliness or sentimentality.This is the sort of family film that offers something to entertain the adults as well as the children, and has some underlying serious themes. The main theme is that of courage and of confronting one's fears; the horrors unleashed by the game can (if one is in a particularly serious, analytic frame of mind) be seen as symbolic of the problems that the characters need to overcome. Although (or perhaps because) he is from a wealthy, privileged family, the young Alan is a shy, lonely boy who finds it difficult to make friends and who is neglected by his cold, distant parents. Nevertheless, he does win his father's approval when he finds the courage to stand up to a gang of bullies who have been tormenting him. There is doubtless some Freudian significance in the fact that Alan's father and the murderous Van Pelt are played by the same actor.Children, of course, could not care less about Freudian symbolism and are generally allergic to underlying serious themes. When I was a child the one thing that would kill a book or a film stone dead for me was the suspicion that it was being used by the adult world to preach some morally improving message to me. (C.S. Lewis was a particular bête noire of mine after an intellectually precocious classmate, who even at the age of nine cherished the long-term ambition to become Archbishop of Canterbury, pointed out to me the Christian allegory behind the Narnia stories).Fortunately, any moralising in Jumanji is fairly light, and I suspect that children will simply see it as an exciting adventure story, even if the final twist in the tale involves the intellectually difficult concept of alternative timelines. The special effects used to create the scenes of the rampaging animals seem to have aroused some excitement when the film first came out, although thirteen years on they have a rather retro, nineties feel to them.

She's tough, honest, and determined to get her culprit. But, the real gem in this movie is Nicole Kidman. I won't give away anything here. But in short, watching her character switch gears several times is amazing. How she wasn't considered for an Oscar for this film is an insult. Oh, and for a last treat, check out Anne Bancroft's cameo as Nicole's mother. She steals the scene and plays her part to perfection.So....the flaws. For someone whose character is as meticulous to detail as Nicole's is, she makes two major mistakes that seem rather novice. The subplot, involving the serial rapist, takes up too much of the film. While it is needed, to establish times when Andy needed to be elsewhere, it really served no other purpose.Those might be a little nit-picky. But I digress. Other than those two things, I found this to be a top notch mystery that people will enjoy. And the best part is that at least twice you will find yourself thinking you know what is going to happen. And twice, you will be wrong.Enjoy.

Robinson. An extremely wealthy businessman, Joseph Cotten, is beaten to death in his luxury apartment and Heston is assigned to the case. He makes his way on foot to Cotten's apartment, stepping over the bodies, living and dead, that are piled on the streets and stairways.Well -- this is some apartment! Heston walks in and gazes stupefied at the tchotchkas and the furniture. The furniture includes the succulent Leigh Taylor-Young. No wonder he gawks. She comes with the apartment, if the resident wants her to, because living space is almost impossible to find.Heston, whom we are used to seeing as an upright man of principle, strides casually around the scene of the crime, chatting with Taylor-Young before he beds her down. Does he steal anything from the well-stocked apartment? Everything I could lay my hands on. There's some wilted lettuce, a half-turgid stalk of celery, and two apples. There's even a cut of beef. Heston takes it all home to Robinson, who is old enough to remember what this stuff is, and Robinson makes a bit of stew out of it and helps drain the confiscated bottle of bourbon. Heston takes an indifferent munch out of the lettuce but Robinson has tears in his eyes and he savors the feast.The trail gets a little twisted. Cotten turns out to have been on the board of Soylent AND a relative of the mayor. People begin to tail Heston and take pot shots at him. His boss, Brock Peters, tells him to lay off the case, as all cops' bosses do. In other words, something is rotten in the state of New York besides the garbage. Actually, there may be no more state of New York. The city of New York now adjoins the city of Philadelphia. (Good-bye, New Jersey.) Looking northward, the boundary may abut the city of Boston, perhaps somewhere around East Windsor, Connecticut.Heston persists in following the few clues that show up, not so much out of morality but because he doesn't want to lose his job. But Robinson discovers the secret behind Soylent first. It depletes whatever resources Robinson had left and he decides to have an institution send him on his eternal journey.In a poignant scene, Robinson is wheeled into a room of his favorite color, given a painless poison, and is free to watch movies of an earth with natural features that are pristine and beautiful and majestic -- all the things we are recklessly discarding as we carry on with our daily lives now -- and Robinson is treated to a melange of light classics that include romantic snatches of Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony, Tchaikovsky, and Grieg. Heston bursts in and is more astonished by the IMAX images of deer, snow-veined Alps, apple blossoms, and rolling ocean than he was at the slab of meat. Meat, Heston recognized for what it was. But he's never seen anything like the film he -- and Robinson in his last moments -- witness. Heston is unable to even speak.Anyway, he follows Robinson's body out of the Extinction Room or whatever it is, and he too discovers the secret behind the mystery of Soylent, which by now every viewer has also figured out. The film doesn't end on a particularly hopeful note.How well does the movie do at predicting what the world will look like in fifty years? Well, yes and no. It makes the usual assumption that the future will have what we have now, only there will be more of it and it will be bigger. (The futuristic movies of the 1930s had propeller-driven airplanes in every garage.) The quantum leaps that introduce revolutionary social and technological change are usually missed. (The jet airplane did more than make cross-country movement faster; it vulgarized travel, homogenized the world, and eliminated the exotic.) The movie (and presumably the original story) also got the chief assumption behind population growth wrong. Right now, there are more than 6 billion people in the world. This number will more than double by 2050, along with all the problems that accompany it -- pollution, urban sprawl, scarce commodities, and the rest of it. But the streets will never be filled with piles of supernumeraries. Population irruptions such as we're undergoing now, have been studied in numerous animal populations. Thomas Malthus, E. O. Wilson, E. T. Hall, and Paul Ehrlich have written about what happens, and so have I, if I can put myself in this exalted company. What happens is that the population crashes from stress-related diseases or opportunistic infections before the hand-to-mouth phase is reached. Ulcers, heart failure, and AIDS are examples. Wars too, if you can think of them as a stress-related disease. To paraphrase Malthus, if we don't stop it, Nature will.Don't get me started on cannibalism either. Anthropologists don't only ask why; they also ask why not? Do I have a few more lines left? If I get too close to the limit, somebody flap a napkin at me. This may sound queer, but it may be Charlton Heston's best performance, including his efforts at Shakespeare. He's not a very expressive actor but his insouciance as he wanders through the dead Cotten's apartment, opening drawers, leaving nonchalant insults in his wake, openly stuffing a pillow case with every valuable in sight (except Leigh Taylor-Young, who is too big), is marvelous. He's played masterful many times before, but never with such irony.

There have always been signals behind that dazzling smile and that dashing dimple, that nobody could be so quick, so on top of things, could embody so much savoir-faire. NOBODY could be that good. And here Hitchcock puts the viewer's doubts to effective use.Grant, as Johnny Aysgarth, meets the supposedly homely and spinsterish Lina, Joan Fontaine, and becomes interested in her. He arranges to meet her outside the home of her well-off parents, Dame May Witty and Sir Cedric Hardwicke, both of whom distrust him. But Grant is grand. He steals her away to the top of a windy hill, undoes the top button of her blouse to show off her beautiful unicipal mapillary (sternoclavicular notch) and rearranges her hair. She's overcome and later, overhearing her father describe her as a spinster with brains and a nice personality, with no warning, she spins around and gives Grant a great big smooch. Grace Kelly would do the same in To Catch a Thief, and it probably comes as a surprise to the audience, but I don't know why. It happens to me all the time. Beautiful women throw themselves at my feet so often that at times it's difficult to walk.Anyway, the two are married and after an expensive honeymoon Grant moves them into an extravagant house with a servant. It's only then that the penniless Grant discovers that her annual allowance will not pay for their expenses. Grant is faced with the prospect of finding a job. He makes rueful jokes about learning how to handle a shovel, then brightly announces that he has a decent offer from a cousin of his, Mr. Melbeck (Leo G. Carroll).But the financial problems persist. Grant involves a cheerful, generous, lovable old friend of his, Nigel Bruce, rather a dull bulb, in a scheme to buy some land and build a development. Not only does the deal fall through but, under mysterious circumstances in Paris, and in the presence of an unidentified English gentleman, Bruce drinks too much brandy and dies from it, an event the prescient Grant could foresee, and the joint corporation is never dissolved.

Joan Fontaine snoops around in Grant's personal correspondence, as some wives are want to do, and discovers that he's been making inquiries into the status of her life insurance. The purloined letter informs her that Grant has been denied a loan on her insurance, that the only way he can collect is if she dies.Gulp. She loves Grant deeply but he has been looking into poisons that leave no trace, and one night, after a row, he brings her a glass of minatory milk -- the famous glass of milk that Hitchcock planted a light bulb in to make it glow in the dark. Fontaine is convinced that the milk is poisoned. What to do! There are a couple of notable things about this film, the underlying sliminess of Cary Grant's ingratiating personality aside. First, there is a dinner at the house of a rough-talking woman author, Isobel Sedbusk. (What a name.) Her brother, a pathologist with glasses like coke-bottle bottoms, is discussing poisons during the meal and mentions a corpse that dropped in recently while deliberately carving a surgical slice of meat from the breast of a small roast fowl. Then there is Mrs. Sedbusk's, umm, companion, Jessie, who, if not a lesbian, certainly should be one, with her hair severely tied back, her mannish features, and her black suit and necktie. Then there is the later visit from two detectives who question Fontaine in her house. One of them, the goofy-looking one, is entranced by a loony looking modern painting in the vestibule. He gawks at it when they enter and again when they leave, and each time his baffled stare is accompanied by a chimerical arpeggio on the piano in Franz Waxman's score. (The music during the last high-speed sequence was lifted and re-used in Waxman's score for the skiing sequence in Spellbound.)Well, boys and girls, not to worry! You and I both know that Cary Grant is no murderer (as he was in the original story). Not a bit of it. He was going to poison HIMSELF but then decided it was the coward's way out, so at the end he decides to go back and face the music, even though it means prison. A man can't change, he firmly informs Fontaine. Oh, Johnny, let's go back and face it together, she begs him -- and so they do. We can all be forgiven, though, for suspecting that Grant in this case may be right. A man can change alright, but given Grant's anti-social history he probably won't. And she'll spend the rest of her life trying to bring you under control once I get the bit in your teeth, as she once put it.Joan, you're lovely, blond, English, naive, and vulnerable -- but your eyebrows are asymmetrical.

Good luck! ","genre":"Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"30 December 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Cary Grant is here, as elsewhere, very likable. Impulsive, playful, flirtatious, devilishly handsome, and above all, charming. Too charming, in fact. There have always been signals behind that dazzling smile and that dashing dimple, that nobody could be so quick, so on top of things, could embody so much savoir-faire. NOBODY could be that good. And here Hitchcock puts the viewer's doubts to effective use.Grant, as Johnny Aysgarth, meets the supposedly homely and spinsterish Lina, Joan Fontaine, and becomes interested in her. He arranges to meet her outside the home of her well-off parents, Dame May Witty and Sir Cedric Hardwicke, both of whom distrust him. But Grant is grand. He steals her away to the top of a windy hill, undoes the top button of her blouse to show off her beautiful unicipal mapillary (sternoclavicular notch) and rearranges her hair. She's overcome and later, overhearing her father describe her as a spinster with brains and a nice personality, with no warning, she spins around and gives Grant a great big smooch. Grace Kelly would do the same in To Catch a Thief, and it probably comes as a surprise to the audience, but I don't know why. It happens to me all the time. Beautiful women throw themselves at my feet so often that at times it's difficult to walk.Anyway, the two are married and after an expensive honeymoon Grant moves them into an extravagant house with a servant. It's only then that the penniless Grant discovers that her annual allowance will not pay for their expenses. Grant is faced with the prospect of finding a job. He makes rueful jokes about learning how to handle a shovel, then brightly announces that he has a decent offer from a cousin of his, Mr. Melbeck (Leo G. Carroll).But the financial problems persist. Grant involves a cheerful, generous, lovable old friend of his, Nigel Bruce, rather a dull bulb, in a scheme to buy some land and build a development. Not only does the deal fall through but, under mysterious circumstances in Paris, and in the presence of an unidentified English gentleman, Bruce drinks too much brandy and dies from it, an event the prescient Grant could foresee, and the joint corporation is never dissolved. On top of that, good old Johnny, it turns out, has embezzled money from his cousin's firm and charges against him for two thousand pounds are pending.Are we talking about Cary Grant as a MURDERER? It certainly begins to look that way. Joan Fontaine snoops around in Grant's personal correspondence, as some wives are want to do, and discovers that he's been making inquiries into the status of her life insurance. The purloined letter informs her that Grant has been denied a loan on her insurance, that the only way he can collect is if she dies.Gulp. She loves Grant deeply but he has been looking into poisons that leave no trace, and one night, after a row, he brings her a glass of minatory milk -- the famous glass of milk that Hitchcock planted a light bulb in to make it glow in the dark. Fontaine is convinced that the milk is poisoned. What to do! There are a couple of notable things about this film, the underlying sliminess of Cary Grant's ingratiating personality aside. First, there is a dinner at the house of a rough-talking woman author, Isobel Sedbusk. (What a name.) Her brother, a pathologist with glasses like coke-bottle bottoms, is discussing poisons during the meal and mentions a corpse that dropped in recently while deliberately carving a surgical slice of meat from the breast of a small roast fowl. Then there is Mrs. Sedbusk's, umm, companion, Jessie, who, if not a lesbian, certainly should be one, with her hair severely tied back, her mannish features, and her black suit and necktie. Then there is the later visit from two detectives who question Fontaine in her house. One of them, the goofy-looking one, is entranced by a loony looking modern painting in the vestibule. He gawks at it when they enter and again when they leave, and each time his baffled stare is accompanied by a chimerical arpeggio on the piano in Franz Waxman's score. (The music during the last high-speed sequence was lifted and re-used in Waxman's score for the skiing sequence in Spellbound.)Well, boys and girls, not to worry! You and I both know that Cary Grant is no murderer (as he was in the original story). Not a bit of it. He was going to poison HIMSELF but then decided it was the coward's way out, so at the end he decides to go back and face the music, even though it means prison. A man can't change, he firmly informs Fontaine. Oh, Johnny, let's go back and face it together, she begs him -- and so they do. We can all be forgiven, though, for suspecting that Grant in this case may be right. A man can change alright, but given Grant's anti-social history he probably won't.

Hot on the terminator's trail, however, is a human from the future named Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) who must save Sarah. Why? Sarah is the mother of John Connor, the leader of humanity's only resistance in the future when our machines\/computers turn on us. The machines, desperate during this future war, have turned to time travel to completely eliminate Connor's existence. Terminator is a story that takes place in the present (well, 1984 present) but it's relevance is for the future and does include some flash-forwards of what creator James Cameron's man vs. machine apocalyptic future might look like. Most significantly, it's film's first serious attempt to imagine where science and technology might lead us.Sure, Star Trek and 2001 Space Odyssey are among some of the ways Hollywood has imagined the future, but those are much more fantastical and not focused on Earth. Terminator is a much darker depiction that strongly considers science, not on dreaming up crazy sci-fi gadgets and the like. It's also more of an action thriller than sci-fi, seeing as the action mostly takes place in the 80s. Basically, the Terminator is an unstoppable force that follows Sarah and Kyle wherever they go no matter how many bullets he takes or explosions he endures. It's a non-stop thrill ride that really gets your blood pumping.While the movie thrives mostly on your amazement with the Terminator, wondering if he'll ever be stopped and how much carnage you'll get to watch along the way, eventually you get hooked on the future\/sci-fi element as Kyle tells Sarah all about what's going on or he tries to convince the police to believe him. What makes each scene so attention-grabbing, however, is the mechanical nature of the way Cameron has shot this movie. Everything the terminator does is filmed in a very sequential manner, using lots of angles instead of constant camera movement. What's interesting is that he films construction vehicles and other normal machines we're used to in the same way, using close ups as if they're working on their own, without humans. It's his way of using the present to foreshadow the future.The acting in the movie and love story that develops between Sarah and Kyle are among it's biggest weak points. Hamilton is good, she really stands out as the most normal, human thing about the whole film, but Biehn is terrible as a lead actor. He comes across as creepy and odd and you only like him because he's helping Sarah, so when she starts to like him, you're kind of grossed out. Someone stronger would have made this a nearly flawless action film. So while Terminator' may seem like an example of a classic because of Schwarzenegger and all the action and explosions, it really leaves its mark as showing how capable Hollywood can be of creating an entertaining AND believable future, inspiring future films (no pun intended) to do just that.

The design and feel of the first movie seemed not to have been taken into consideration here, and instead of a small movie with a small cast of characters, we have a special effects guy (Chris Walas) directing a movie, and everything is about special effects. Though the characters are developed somewhat here, they play backseat to the plot and special effects, which was not true of the first film.Seth Brundle from the first Fly laid his seed prior to his demise, and the carrier of his baby, Ronnie, dies in childbirth. The result of this half fly, half human baby is Martin Brundle (Eric Stoltz), a child who doesn't sleep, has a photographic memory and grows much faster than the normal human being. He is kept isolated from the outside world by Bartok industries, run by the seemingly nice Mr. Bartok (Lee Richardson). When Martin hits five years old, he is actually about twenty and he gets his own place, and falls in love with Beth (Daphne Zuniga), an employee of Bartok, his fly genes begin to kick in.The special effects and gruesome scenes are much more frequent here than in the first film. In the first film, it was shocking to see Seth Brundle looking diseased as the fly. Here, right off the bat we start with all kinds of gruesome make-up effects and special effects and they play as the main focus of the movie. But, even with the more frequented use of makeup effects, they aren't as effective, and they don't look as good. Martin Brundle's fly looks more like the creature from the black lagoon than a fly. It's funnier than it is scary or disturbing. And because of all these gruesome sights, this is an action film more than anything else, where the first was an effective drama. This one is more disgusting than anything else.The characters here are well developed, though they are limited to lots of poor dialogue. Lee Richardson is a menacing villain, and is good at being both evil and nice. Eric Stoltz plays a man-child, and gives a weird performance, but it must have been what he was going for. The romance between Beth and Martin is really corny and forced, and is progressed in the worst way, through montage. The plot of this film is fairly predictable, and this serves as nothing more than a poor continuation of a family that should have ended with Seth.Overall, this wasn't a bad movie.

The film has a slow pace compared to some but this isn't such a bad thing, it definitely didn't feel drawn out, it seemed to have enough time to venture down all the paths it needed including the death of Mary's mother.The film is classed partly as horror but the only part of the film which was scary to see was the scene where Mary witnesses Hde become Jekyll for the first and last time. The special effects were a little out there compared to the rest of the film, it was almost like someone put a microwave in Dr Jekyll's Victorian kitchen. It would have been better to see there faces gently merge from one character to the other.Other than that all I have to say is this is a brilliant film. Totally unexpected and charming in lots of ways.

I should mention the film was originally 2 hours and 23 minutes in length when it was released, much of the footage has been lost, but with what has remained, this shortened (1 hour and 59 minutes) version of the sci-fi masterpiece is still an inspiration. Anyway, set in the future (2000, or 2026, both of which far away back then) in the city of Metropolis, and the humans are divided into two groups thinkers (who enjoy the life in the city, not knowing how anything works), and the workers (who run the city from underground, and achieve all the goals). One thinker, Freder (Gustav Fröhlich), son of the city's running man John Fredersen (Alfred Abel), dares to go below after following his love interest Maria (Brigitte Helm), and after experiencing their world for himself, he joins her cause to try and get both worlds together. Meanwhile, Freder's father discovers scientist C.A. Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) has created a robot, that will take the form of Maria, to get control of the underworld back, and get Freder out the way. The real Maria is imprisoned by Rotwang, while her copy is appearing on stage (in the city) as an exotic dancer. Unfortunately the Maria copy returns to the underworld, and plans for all the workers to rebel, and destroy the Heart Machine that powers the city. Neither Freder nor Grot (Heinrich George), the machine's foreman, can stop them, and as a result, the machine is destroyed, and the city becomes flooded with both revolting workers and water. In the end, Grot and all the workers finds Maria, who the hold responsible, and they burn her to death, thankfully, it was her copy, and her creator Rotwang also gets what he deserves, and Freder fulfils his role as the Mediator. Also starring Fritz Rasp as Slim, Theodor Loos as Josaphat and Erwin Biswanger as worker 11811. The visuals are magnificent, costing back then an estimated $1,300,000 (imagine how much that would be in today's money), the cityscapes, underground caverns and little special effects are wonderful to look at, the iconic robot (which inspired the look for C-3PO in Star Wars) looks great, and the film features brilliant music by Gottfried Huppertz, one of the best influential silent films ever made. Outstanding!

There is no words to describe how much better this film is. Everything is nearly perfect with this film especially the aliens and the horror scenes.To see this movie, I recommend that you watch the the 1979 version first because the plot is a direct continuation of that movie. In Aliens, Ripley has been in hypersleep for 57 years. She is upset that her daughter is gone and even more because no one believes her tale. But, the company sends her with Marines to figure out what happened to the colonists on the original planet Ripley was on 57 years before. The plot and the characters will keep you in suspense.The acting is top-notch. Almost every actor gave excellent performances. Signourey Weaver still is powerful playing Ripley. I was impressed with Carrie Henn as she plays a girl that survived the alien attacks on the colonists. Bill Paxton was decent even if he was a bit whiny.The special effects and the action are great. The explosions are top-of-the-art(only for that time period). The visual effects are stunning. The action scenes are fun to watch. There is more action than the first film because we see that Ripley can kick some serious butt.The music by James Horner adds spice to the movie.Overall, this is a perfect sci-fi\/horror film.
