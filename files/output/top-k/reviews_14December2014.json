Granted, I have seen Red Letter Media and many others and I actually agree with their points. But there's one thing I would like to say to them. Episode I influenced me to be a writer. It can be told as a short story actually. I would run around with my toy lightsaber pretending to beat up battle droids and my mother would ask me, Jimmy, do you want to be a Jedi when you grow up? and I said, No, Mommy, I want to be the guy that writes the stories. I'd learn new things and words from my mother explaining what was going on. The simple beginning where they just dash through the droids, the pod race was a favorite, as was the epic dual at the end. The sad truth is that you don't feel that way once you're older. You notice flaws and become more aware of the story. Look at it this way, every generation has their own thing. You had the original Star Wars, your fathers had the old westerns, their fathers had classic literature. The generation before doesn't get or like the next one. The reality is that they're all stories. Whichever one influenced you doesn't matter cause all good ideas come from somewhere. I was four years old when I said that I wanted to write.

I'd heard many different reviews towards the movie. From my mother saying she enjoyed it, to my father saying it was a very mediocre movie. However, I'm the kind of person to try things out to make my own mind on. I don't listen to what everyone else says, I find out on my own. So I watched it with my friend. I would have to say this movie was pretty good. However, it's a really intense movie. You really have to be old enough to understand everything that's happening. For example, if I'd watched this movie two years ago, I wouldn't have understood why all the Jewish people were being killed and why the Nazi's were so cruel. But school taught me well and I learned all about the Holocaust. When I started watching, I thought the movie would be in color, but once I got through the first 10 minutes, I realized it was a black and white film. I was really confused because I checked it up and found out it was made in 1994. But after doing more research I realized that Steven Spielberg was trying to make it a very powerful movie, and indeed it was. The black and white aspect was, as I said, powerful. The girl in the red coat was really really strong as it showed me that everyone, no matter the age and innocence was killed. The actors chosen for this film was a phenomenal choice. Liam Neeson portrayed Oskar Schindler way too well. After seeing Neeson in so many other films such as Star Wars, Batman Begins, Clash of the Titans, etc. I realized how good of an actor he is. He really can act as many different characters, from being a kind and caring Qui-Gon Jinn in Star Wars to being a really strong and harsh Ra's Al Ghul in The Dark Night Rises to finally being a kind, caring, strong but, in a sense selfish, Oskar Schindler. Then with Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes, well I was very satisfied with the actor selections for this film. All in all, I found this film a very dramatic, intense, powerful, but very entertaining. It had a very strong depiction of the Holocaust and how scary it was for all the Jews. Along with how nasty the Nazis were towards all Jews. I would rate this film a 9 out of 10 for all the drama and intensity.

I don't know what has put me off seeking it out for all these years. Perhaps it's because I'm not a big sci-fi fan, however I am a Stanley Kubrick fan. I particularly adore The Shining and love the way Stanley Kubrick soaks up a hypnotic atmosphere so that the film becomes an experience. After seeing some clips on the strange documentary, Room 237, I thought that the film looked right up my alley! I've also heard nothing but hype for years with people calling it one of the greatest films ever made, so I was extremely excited when I sat down to watch it.Unfortunately watching it, for me, was a little bit like sex. You want the first time to be the best, but in honesty, the more you do it, the better it gets. I had a banging headache throughout the first half and so really could not appreciate the loud music and atonal sounds because it was just so painful! Halfway through, I had to leave and get myself a Tesco headache pill and towards the end of the film it did go away. I also left to go to the loo about three times, as I had a lot of coffee to drink so that I'd have the stamina to stay up and also to sober myself up.Why am I telling you this? Well, I don't know. I think to get the full 2001 effect, you need to completely immerse yourself in it, but I struggled to do this. However, that doesn't mean that I didn't appreciate what I saw. In fact, I'm pretty sure that what I saw was an absolute masterpiece. I was completely sucked in, right from the beginning where sinister music played for about five minutes over a blank screen. It's such an unusual way to open, hinting that the film you're about to see isn't your usual rip-roaring science fiction adventure. We then get that glorious famous music with a beautiful image of a sun rising over the Earth. It's an amazing title sequence which made the hairs on my neck stand on end.I think it's a stroke of genius having the first scene, in a film which is largely set in the future, be set at the beginning of time itself. It must have been so jarring for audiences in 1968, of course everyone knows that the film starts with the monkeys now because it's so widely talked about. Speaking of the year in which it came out, I cannot believe that this film was made in the 60's! I saw it in blu-ray and it looked like a film which had came out last week. It's easy to see why it so disliked when it first came out, because it's just so ahead of its time. Although, some of the monkey suits did look a bit naff!We're then thrown into the year 2001, where (apparently) space travel is an everyday thing and stewardesses wear bright pink clothes complete with a strange bubble hat. To be quite honest with you, the remainder of the film is very difficult to put into words. It's pure art in the form of film. It's a rarity these days, however people like David Lynch and Nicolas Winding Refn are striving to keep it alive. There are long sequences of spaceships flying overhead to classical music and people walking slowly upside down. It all creates a certain feeling and experience which you have to see for yourself.2001 A Space Odyssey doesn't really have much of a plot. Astronauts find a strange giant tablet on the moon, and then some more astronauts go on a mission which I don't entirely understand the purpose of, with a creepy robot called, HAL, which is of course now an iconic character. It's strange because a lot of the film is incredibly slow and, dare I say it, boring. But there's something about it which keeps you interested and locked to the screen. Scenes which would last five minutes in an ordinary Hollywood film, last up to half an hour here and it does create a unique and immersive experience which stays on your subconscious for a while.A lot of the film is very haunting. The choral chants whenever the strange black tablet appeared created a wonderful atmosphere of mystery and impending doom. I also found the scene where HAL sings, very creepy. Of course, the most talked about scene is the Lynchian finale where we're plunged into a psychedelic and hypnotic fantasy world. The final scene makes absolutely no sense, but it most definitely haunts you. I couldn't help but have chills all the way up my spine when the music plays and the baby looks right towards you. It's scary and very powerful.I think subsequent viewings are going to make 2001 a definite favourite of mine. It's unlike anything I've ever seen before. After seeing this now, I find it strange how people are comparing it to Interstellar. Interstellar is a somewhat conventional and fast-paced sci-fi adventure, albeit an absolutely astounding one! Whereas, 2001 A Space Odyssey is a slow art film. They're impossible to compare! Both of them are masterpieces in their own right though. It's a film which will definitely stay with me, and I look forward to plunging myself into its world again.

For me, he was my favorite, possibly still is. Part of the reasons for this is a pure nostalgia factor in that he was the Bond when I was growing up. His films were the ones that were on television and when there was a new film he was Bond. Another reason he may be my favorite is the movies themselves. His Bond films were an eclectic collection of movies that were usually fast paced and fun. Most of his films featured multiple exotic locations , lots of cool action sequences and an awesome villain. Roger Moore's Bond got to duel with Christopher Lee and in this one Christopher Walken two of the best actors to portray Bond villains. Sure, Octopussy was almost the Austin Power's of its day in that it was almost a parody, but this one reigned in the campiness a bit and while not his best work, still ended his tenure as Bond in nice fashion. Not perfect, mind you, as Timothy Dalton's 'The Living Daylights' would be better, this one is still is a good Bond film that probably did represent the 80's more so than did any other Bond film from its opening featuring a Duran Duran song and lots of neon to the inclusion of Grace Jones as villainous sidekick Mayday.The story has Bond recovering a microchip from a Russian facility that mirrors one at a plant run by Max Zorin. Meaning that somehow the Russians have gotten a hold of one of these chips. James sets out to investigate Zorin at his horse staples as Zorin seems to also have an unnatural edge in the racing of horses as well. It is not too long before Zorin tries to off Bond and show himself as the bad guy and soon Bond must go to San Francisco where he must try to figure out what Zorin's plans are as Zorin seems to be plotting something large. Bond will be assisted by a lady that Zorin has been trying to pay off and intimidate and together they will find themselves in a cave that is laden with Zorin's men as they plan to do something insane to turn the world of computers and microchips decidedly in Zorin's favor.Roger Moore was quite old by this time and it was time for him to relinquish the role of 007. That being said, he still did a great job as the one thing you can say about him is that unlike Sean Connery near the end of his run as Bond, Moore still seemed to have fun doing it. In fact, I would say had Moore started as Bond instead of Connery, he would likely have kept the role up to View To a Kill. Here his age is apparent, as he is older than Connery, so one knows that you're mainly getting stunt doubles, but they made it work. Christopher Walken is the main villain of the piece and he is crazy good. Probably one of the more psychotic Bond villains he relishes killing those who work for him and laughs as he faces death. Grace Jones is also in this film and like most of the villains henchmen, she is a formidable opponent. Patrick Mcnee also does a good job as the agent initially investigating Zorin's horses. Now for the main problem with the film, Tanya Roberts. She has the looks, but she just does not seem like a Bond girl to me. She is perhaps, my least favorite Bond girl besides Denise Richards in The World is Not Enough.So, I think this film was a nice farewell for Roger Moore as Bond. I actually thought Octopussy was good too, but this one was just a better send off as it had less comedic elements than did that film. Like I stated above, that one was nearly a parody in areas. Roger Moore's age does show, but he still carries the film well as he faces off a very nice opponent in Zorin played by Walken. I did not enjoy this one as much when I was younger, but it has grown on me, it is just nice to see so many very well down practical special effects rather than mainly CGI ones that accompany nearly every film released these days. It is also interesting that this is the film that sort of brought snowboarding into the open and made it quite big, so Roger Moore's final Bond film did start something rather big and that is rather cool. So is this film&#x85;not even Moore's best Bond movie, but a nice cool entry into the series and a nice farewell to probably the actor who enjoyed being Bond the most.

Sure, Octopussy was almost the Austin Power's of its day in that it was almost a parody, but this one reigned in the campiness a bit and while not his best work, still ended his tenure as Bond in nice fashion. Not perfect, mind you, as Timothy Dalton's 'The Living Daylights' would be better, this one is still is a good Bond film that probably did represent the 80's more so than did any other Bond film from its opening featuring a Duran Duran song and lots of neon to the inclusion of Grace Jones as villainous sidekick Mayday.The story has Bond recovering a microchip from a Russian facility that mirrors one at a plant run by Max Zorin. Meaning that somehow the Russians have gotten a hold of one of these chips. James sets out to investigate Zorin at his horse staples as Zorin seems to also have an unnatural edge in the racing of horses as well. It is not too long before Zorin tries to off Bond and show himself as the bad guy and soon Bond must go to San Francisco where he must try to figure out what Zorin's plans are as Zorin seems to be plotting something large. Bond will be assisted by a lady that Zorin has been trying to pay off and intimidate and together they will find themselves in a cave that is laden with Zorin's men as they plan to do something insane to turn the world of computers and microchips decidedly in Zorin's favor.Roger Moore was quite old by this time and it was time for him to relinquish the role of 007. That being said, he still did a great job as the one thing you can say about him is that unlike Sean Connery near the end of his run as Bond, Moore still seemed to have fun doing it. In fact, I would say had Moore started as Bond instead of Connery, he would likely have kept the role up to View To a Kill. Here his age is apparent, as he is older than Connery, so one knows that you're mainly getting stunt doubles, but they made it work. Christopher Walken is the main villain of the piece and he is crazy good. Probably one of the more psychotic Bond villains he relishes killing those who work for him and laughs as he faces death. Grace Jones is also in this film and like most of the villains henchmen, she is a formidable opponent. Patrick Mcnee also does a good job as the agent initially investigating Zorin's horses. Now for the main problem with the film, Tanya Roberts. She has the looks, but she just does not seem like a Bond girl to me. She is perhaps, my least favorite Bond girl besides Denise Richards in The World is Not Enough.So, I think this film was a nice farewell for Roger Moore as Bond. I actually thought Octopussy was good too, but this one was just a better send off as it had less comedic elements than did that film. Like I stated above, that one was nearly a parody in areas. Roger Moore's age does show, but he still carries the film well as he faces off a very nice opponent in Zorin played by Walken. I did not enjoy this one as much when I was younger, but it has grown on me, it is just nice to see so many very well down practical special effects rather than mainly CGI ones that accompany nearly every film released these days. It is also interesting that this is the film that sort of brought snowboarding into the open and made it quite big, so Roger Moore's final Bond film did start something rather big and that is rather cool. So is this film&#x85;not even Moore's best Bond movie, but a nice cool entry into the series and a nice farewell to probably the actor who enjoyed being Bond the most.

There is a closet that seems blocked off for no reason, all of the other tenants seem to be in their 70s and on their first night, there is odd chanting coming from the apartment next door. The oddities are there but they don't seem to shake Rosemary even as she begins having bizarre dreams about ritualistic sex.Her neighbors are not exactly threatening &#x96; they are older grandparent-types who always come by with caring smiles, warm tea and desserts. She and Guy have their closest relationship with Roman and Millie Casavets (Sydney Berman and Ruth Gordon), a childless old couple who treat Rosemary like the daughter they never had. It all seems normal. Rosemary and Guy have the usual husband and wife conflicts, but they remain a loving couple and soon after they settle into the tenement, they decide to have a baby.This is where things turn bizarre.

It's about a guy who cannot create new memories trying to find his wife's killer. That alone is an interesting enough premise. But Christopher Nolan decided to take it even further by making the film go backwards. The film starts with the end, and goes to the beginning. So, right from the start, you know what the end result is, yet, you really don't know what happened. It manages to keep the viewer guessing and asking questions, despite already have given away the ending. That is some truly genius writing and directing on Nolan's part, once again demonstrating his immense talent. Every scene is positively dripping with mystery and suspense, and I can't remember the last time I was so riveted to the screen. This is probably Nolan's best film to date, and I strongly suggest you seek it out.

It's about a guy who cannot create new memories trying to find his wife's killer. That alone is an interesting enough premise. But Christopher Nolan decided to take it even further by making the film go backwards. The film starts with the end, and goes to the beginning. So, right from the start, you know what the end result is, yet, you really don't know what happened. It manages to keep the viewer guessing and asking questions, despite already have given away the ending. That is some truly genius writing and directing on Nolan's part, once again demonstrating his immense talent. Every scene is positively dripping with mystery and suspense, and I can't remember the last time I was so riveted to the screen.

Little 8-yr. old Kevin is accidentally left behind when his family jets off to Paris for Christmas. So it's riddled with continuity errors and plot holes. The garage has a separate entrance but is somehow connected to the main house? (Who cares.) There are so many things going on here. It's an incredibly complex screenplay, which pays homage to so many other movies The burned brass hand-scar (Raiders of the Lost Ark) The Three Stooges (impossible stunts and injuries that would have killed any mortal man.) Angels with Filthy Souls is a parody of Angels with Dirty Faces. Clips from several Christmas movies. Sure it's totally implausible that an 8-year-old boy could actually execute such complicated stunts, but the Micro-Machines (actually candy) are genius, as is the zip line to the treehouse. It's Maculay Culkin's best performance. John Candy plays a great cameo as the Polka King and the sub-plot of Old Man Marley and his grandchild add much heart to the film. There are so many scenes that I love, but the toboggan out the front door and the stinging after shave lotion are the best. I love Buzz's tarantula and the blood-curdling scream (dubbed) from Daniel Stern! (The tarantula on Marv's face is considerably smaller than the one used in other scenes?) A great score by John Williams with some dusty 1950's carols thrown in for good measure. Of course this whole thing could never really happen. The whole movie is a fantasy, but the dream house that the McCallister's live in is real! Also, magically, most of the mess of the house is cleaned up by the time mom is finally united with Kevin, who is no longer home alone.
