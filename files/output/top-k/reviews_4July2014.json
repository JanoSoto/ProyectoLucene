It's not the most intelligent movie you'll see, but all things considered, the premise of an electricity based ET taking over a Russian scientific vessel which a salvage crew have to contend with, survive and ultimately prevent from reaching wider civilisation is pretty nicely realised I thought. For the most part the acting is convincing, particularly from Baldwin, J.L. Curtis, C. Curtis, Augustus and Pacula, with only Sutherland seeming a little off-key at times in my opinion, as the grizzled, negative old sea captain. But for the most part I thought the actors and actresses contributed to the fun with some committed acting. The CGI was visibly distinguishable, but not game-breaking; it was convincing enough, with some good make-up work and monster design as well as mood-setting, character-laden sets and locations.I really liked the concept of the alien life form itself; it comes from a spaceship that's seemingly composed of stable plasma, which passes close by earth and through a Russian spacecraft, transmitting a passenger through to the ship on the water. what it intends to do with humans, who it identifies as a virus itself, is to overcome them, and then use them as spare parts to establish physical, useful forms with which it can set up shop on our planet and do whatever it wants to do.One thing that did stand out as I was watching the film was just how many references the film seemingly borrowed from, as though the film itself were behaving like the alien in it, borrowing aspects from other films and welding them together haphazardly to establish a functional form of its own. Now, don't get me wrong! it's not necessarily a bad thing; it's not downright plagiarism in this case, instead, perhaps intentionally or perhaps unintentionally, it actually adds a level of exploration and\/or parody of the science fiction medium to the film; allow me to elaborate with examples. I've seen many mentions of other films and stories this film reminded people of, and here are several examples I noticed myself; first of all, there are many parallels with The Abyss - naval setting, crew member who goes mad and turns on the others for whatever reason, the additional threat of a hurricane, and even the appearance of the spaceship of the aliens, that ephemeral pinkish hue; Sphere, where the crew communicate with the alien entity through textual conversations on a computer, just like in Virus; The Andromeda Strain, which is a story about an alien virus coming to Earth and wreaking havoc; Terminator and perhaps also Robocop, clearly alluded to and used as inspiration for the half machine half human cyborgs the alien builds; John Carpenter's The Thing, which also featured an alien which liked to assimilate humans into itself, as well as Richie's paranoia near the end about not trusting Foster and Steve about whether they were still themselves or whether they were modified by and under the influence of the alien; and finally, most of all, The Matrix.This film contains many startling similarities with and aspects of The Matrix, which was released in the same year as Virus, unlike all the other films I've pointed out which were released before 1999. It is difficult to say whether they were aware of the similarities, perhaps aware of the development of the matrix, or whether this was a pure coincidence, but let me list those similarities; a hive mind of an electrical, ephemeral nature, who wishes to overpower and, crucially, Control the human race and use human bodies for its own purposes; a sentience which acquires knowledge and exists, 'lives', electronically, through computers and signals and transmissions; a rapidly evolving, technologically adept and extremely intelligent intelligence who develops machines to act in its interests in the physical world; and how about the look and design of the machines? those clustered red 'eyes', recognise them from anywhere? how about the sentinels of the matrix? So, what we ended up with was a patchwork of themes, filming styles, plot devices and references, which come together to create an overall entertaining, committedly acted story about a particularly macabre, calculating, and very alien, extra-terrestrial being, who interrupts a slapdash, mismatched crew of seamen, a few grizzled malcontents and the rest gung-ho young working folk, who think they've stumbled upon the salvage of their lives, but are sorely mistaken, as well as the original Russian crew of the ship, and the spacecraft, which it overwhelmed, used and slaughtered, of course, and must overcome many obstacles, a few self-inflicted, to prevent this dangerous entity from finding a way to undo its isolation and snowball in power and overcome the whole world potentially. they find this predicament in the eye of the storm and must go through the storm to prevail, in more ways then one.Perhaps I shouldn't write a synopsis for anything ever again, heh. Sorry about that. But this is nonetheless something visceral, entertaining, and, if you see it from a particular angle, a rather smart poke at the fourth wall, a science fiction story which is built from parts of many others, the result of which could be more then the sum of its parts, or less, depending on what you're looking to get out of it - smart, allegorical science fiction what-if? brainless horror-SF caper? 90s action movie? personally, I just took it for what it was, and was left intrigued and impressed. it's no classic, but it's worth seeking out. 6\/10.

In debating if September is one of Allen's worst or his worst, on first viewing I would have said yes but re-watching it while nowhere near one of his best it is not that bad. It's not perfect, it does drag a bit with some dialogue that rambles and the ending is very abrupt. And two performances personally didn't quite come off well, Mia Farrow is very shrill here(even for a character as tormented as she was) and it did grate and Sam Waterson is unusually wooden. However, the rest of the acting is great, especially from Elaine Stritch who gives a poignant performance that did have me weeping. Jack Warden has one of the more interesting subsidiary characters and has fun with it, Denholm Elliot is at his most subtle and sympathetic and Dianne Wiest while not as good as she was in Hannah and Her Sisters(which is one of the greatest performances in a Woody Allen film) is fine as well. Allen directs as adroitly as ever, despite being relatively different thematically dialogue, characters and influences wise Allen's style is still unmistakable. The dialogue has some rambling moments but much of it is incredibly intelligent and thought-provoking as well as truthful in a way that is painful as it is heart-breaking. The characters are not easy to like and are purposefully neurotic but the compellingly realistic way they're written and the situations they go through makes you identify with them too and you feel as if you're there and part of the drama. You will be emotionally exhausted by the story afterwards too, and the story itself draws you in with its themes and its characters and rarely lets go. The Bergman and Chekhov influences are very clear but not blatant.

Well, it wouldn't be such a bad thing. He'd save me from watching this movie again.The Curse of Michael Myers doesn't lie. Michael Myers is back a fourth time (remember, Halloween III had no Michael), and he's a curse to everyone in Haddonfield! This time Tommy is older, the Strodes live in Michael's house, and we are back in, of course, Haddonfield. I can say this much The kills are more brutal, the cinematography is surprisingly decent, and the film moves along at a fast pace. What's not so good? Everything else. Let's start with the characters. Kara Strode, the lead protagonist, is probably one of the weakest main characters I have ever run across. She does absolutely nothing to save her family, she clearly cannot defend herself to her husband, and she should win the worst mother award. Her husband? Typical self-absorbed scum that knows the family secrets, and the character that everyone hates. How about Tommy? Paul Rudd tried, but you can tell this was one of his first major television\/film roles. With his emotionless expressions and his attempts at being this heroic character, the guy falls short. As for anyone else? Well I liked Debra. But maybe that's because she didn't have a lot to work with. You don't really come to these movies for the performances however.The story? I mean it's Michael Myers reeking havoc on Haddonfield, must I go on? Alright, alright, I will. Michael's niece Jamie has disappeared from Michael's original town, and she runs off with Michael's child. Flash forward six years and the Strodes adopt Laurie, Michael's niece, who still has the baby. But Michael's not too happy that he doesn't have his child, so how is he going to get it? What Michael Myers does best. Kill! So now the whole Strode family is in danger because they have Michael's baby.At least this film tried to do something different rather than Michael coming back another time, and just trying to kill everything he sees in plain sight. But I would've rather had that storyline to be perfectly honest. The birth, Michael's revenge- it just doesn't work. The most interesting part of the movie however was when the old lady told Danny about the origin of Halloween. I thought that, had the movie followed something along those lines, the direction this movie would be going in would be far more refreshing. Maybe that's just a Halloween III fan speaking here.And of course, the body count. Impalements, electrocutions, suffocation, there is no disappointment in any of these deaths. Especially a particular scene at the town's party in Haddonfield , without giving too much away. The film is also paced pretty well. I mean the ending sags a little, but Michael is always lurking around the house or in the town. Or, someone is talking about Michael. The movie never veers off of him which makes for a more entertaining movie. The look of the film like stated before was also nice. You have some nice blue hues and some of the scenes of Halloween make you feel like it's October 31st. The plethora of pumpkins, the orange-y leaves, the candy-corn lights. Whenever a movie makes me feel like I'm in Halloween, it's just that much more atmospheric.Overall, The Curse of Michael Myers was not an awful movie, despite my rather pessimistic review title and opening sentence. The story just wasn't strong enough to hold this movie for 80+ minutes, the characters were really nothing special, and the ending was nothing less than unsatisfying. I'd say if you are a big fan of body counts, Michael, or a film's particular visual style, give Curse a chance. You'll get plenty of those three. As for anyone else, for a good Halloween sequel, try Season of the Witch. It might not have Michael in it, but the story is one of the most original and entertaining of the series. And the atmosphere is certainly better in that movie than this movie.

Let's start with the characters. Kara Strode, the lead protagonist, is probably one of the weakest main characters I have ever run across. She does absolutely nothing to save her family, she clearly cannot defend herself to her husband, and she should win the worst mother award. Her husband? Typical self-absorbed scum that knows the family secrets, and the character that everyone hates. How about Tommy? Paul Rudd tried, but you can tell this was one of his first major television\/film roles. With his emotionless expressions and his attempts at being this heroic character, the guy falls short. As for anyone else? Well I liked Debra. But maybe that's because she didn't have a lot to work with. You don't really come to these movies for the performances however.The story? I mean it's Michael Myers reeking havoc on Haddonfield, must I go on? Alright, alright, I will. Michael's niece Jamie has disappeared from Michael's original town, and she runs off with Michael's child. Flash forward six years and the Strodes adopt Laurie, Michael's niece, who still has the baby. But Michael's not too happy that he doesn't have his child, so how is he going to get it? What Michael Myers does best. Kill! So now the whole Strode family is in danger because they have Michael's baby.At least this film tried to do something different rather than Michael coming back another time, and just trying to kill everything he sees in plain sight. But I would've rather had that storyline to be perfectly honest. The birth, Michael's revenge- it just doesn't work. The most interesting part of the movie however was when the old lady told Danny about the origin of Halloween. I thought that, had the movie followed something along those lines, the direction this movie would be going in would be far more refreshing. Maybe that's just a Halloween III fan speaking here.And of course, the body count. Impalements, electrocutions, suffocation, there is no disappointment in any of these deaths. Especially a particular scene at the town's party in Haddonfield , without giving too much away. The film is also paced pretty well. I mean the ending sags a little, but Michael is always lurking around the house or in the town. Or, someone is talking about Michael. The movie never veers off of him which makes for a more entertaining movie. The look of the film like stated before was also nice. You have some nice blue hues and some of the scenes of Halloween make you feel like it's October 31st. The plethora of pumpkins, the orange-y leaves, the candy-corn lights. Whenever a movie makes me feel like I'm in Halloween, it's just that much more atmospheric.Overall, The Curse of Michael Myers was not an awful movie, despite my rather pessimistic review title and opening sentence. The story just wasn't strong enough to hold this movie for 80+ minutes, the characters were really nothing special, and the ending was nothing less than unsatisfying. I'd say if you are a big fan of body counts, Michael, or a film's particular visual style, give Curse a chance. You'll get plenty of those three. As for anyone else, for a good Halloween sequel, try Season of the Witch. It might not have Michael in it, but the story is one of the most original and entertaining of the series. And the atmosphere is certainly better in that movie than this movie.

He has shown that he has gained considerable experience over time and has picked various films to be in that people always remember him from. But like many other actors, they choose to be in films that are somehow odd concoctions that are questionable to how they were even given a green light. This is one of those strange films. It has plot, but its direction is intriguingly out of place at times. Also for a movie starring Kevin Bacon, it really doesn't showcase him. There's a lot to at look at for what worked and what could've been improved over its flaws.Viewers are introduced to Jimmy Dolan (Kevin Bacon), a selfish, cocky headed recruiter to St. Joe's basketball team. He's been working for several years and feels that when his boss retires, his seat is already set for him. Turns out though, according to his boss, he still doesn't have what it takes to lead. Then, out of the blue Jimmy finds what looks like could be a potential recruit for the team, but is quickly shot down from his superior. So being the rebel that he is, he decides to find this recruit anywho on his own. Surprisingly, later on his superior has no problem with what he did. He disobeyed a direct order, which means punishment not reversal of the expected reaction. That's very cliché and unrealistic.The recruit that Jimmy is looking for is an African, specifically in Kenya named Saleh (Charles Gitonga Maina) who has quite a bit of length to his height. Seriously, this guy is TALL. Saleh is apart of a Kenyan tribe called the Winabe and Jimmy hopes to earn their trust. And how better to do that than take part in their traditions and culture. Another cliché aspect to the plot's writing. This is not the first time this kind of experience has been shown, especially with African tribes. Why is it always with the African tribes? Apparently a number of these scenes were supposed to be funny when in fact they come off either unfunny or uncalled for. This movie is rated PG and yet people are cursing, blurting out sexual slang and even a scene with blood involving a knife. How is that acceptable? Who rated this movie?This also demonstrates the incompetence of the director and writer. The writer Max Apple, who only worked on two other productions in his life, didn't make a screenplay with much cleverness or distinguished traits. Most, if not all of it is generic and out of place. Worser so, is that Paul Michael Glaser has flimsy directional skills; especially for accepting Apple's screenplay without even suggesting more rewrites. A big chunk of the story's first two acts focus on Jimmy trying to earn the tribes trust which is out of his own selfish motivations. Who cares, there are other things that could've been looked upon, than it taking up the majority of the running time. Musically speaking, David Newman's score was appropriate to the setting and tried to make it as up beat as possible but it had nothing memorable. The camera work by Dick Pope was acceptable too. A number of shots contained a lot of African terrain and helped at least give the film some scope.Possibly the only character with enough true saving grace to the film is Charles Maina as the Winabe basketball recruit. Saleh as an individual has more charm than any other character in the entire running time. With his selfless personality and genuine smile, it is difficult not to enjoy him when he's on screen. It's shocking actually because again, Kevin Bacon stars in it too, yet he comes off just as generic and boring as the rest of the cast accept Charles Maina. Even weirder is that Maina didn't go on to be anything bigger. How come? The man acted respectively, why shouldn't he be given another chance? It's not a terrible film, but there's nothing that hasn't been presented before. See it for Charles Maina's performance.Even with Kevin Bacon on board, this sports comedy isn't all that funny or entertaining. The only actor to stand out is Charles Maina.

Tom Hanks is an incredible actor and he delivers yet another exceptional performance as the sensitive guard willing to treat his prisoners like people, unlike his colleagues such as the harsh and unforgiving Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison). Michael Clarke Duncan delivers a really touching performance that culminates into an emotional ending that may bring a few tears. Even the other prisoners, played by Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell, offer emotive performances with their own descent into madness knowing that they are waiting to die. The majority of the film is set in either the prison block or the electric chair room, which helps to reinforce the intense feeling of entrapment.The story itself is a little unusual as there is a touch of the supernatural throughout, however it's surprisingly easy to accept this into the normality of the film. As you can expect from a film about Death Row it is a little upsetting to watch at times, but it's mostly a carefully woven story that gently unravels the history of the prisoners and why they are all there, focusing much more on the emotional aspects of such a setting for both the prisoners and the guards, rather than the physicality of it. I only have one real criticism it was too long. At just over three hours long I felt like it was losing its emotional momentum and could have managed without some scenes and been just as, if not more, powerful a film.

One of the last big Hollywood musicals, it is also among the best of that period.If you thought a musical about the creation of the Declaration of Independence would be sleep-inducing, then you would be wrong. The well-drawn characters, witty dialogue, and good humor will keep your interest throughout.Of course, there's also drama and romance. The film never lets you forget the consequences of war and the looming threat of the English. The signing of the Declaration at the end of the film is not pictured as a moment of total triumph; the bell tolling in the background and the music lend a gravity to the moment. In fact, there is a lot of poignancy in this otherwise delightful film Martha Jefferson's song He Plays the Violin has lyrics which foreshadow her premature death by childbirth and Mama Look Sharp, sung by a shell-shocked young soldier, is heartbreaking.The songs are mostly fantastic and catchy (Till Then is a little too sappy for me) and the performances are mesmerizing. How can one even pick a favorite? Howard Da Silva makes a funny Benjamin Franklin and I never failed to laugh when Ron Holgate's Richard Henry Lee showed up. But like most people, my favorite performance is that of William Daniels as John Adams. He was just perfect, literally perfect (or maybe, literal-Lee perfect... ha ha).There are a few things in this film which are not so perfect though at two hours and forty-five minutes, it does drag sometimes. There are moments where the film goes 30-40 minutes without any musical numbers, which feels jarring. Overall though, this is a fine musical, well-produced and acted.

It's like Disney World &#x96; Just see the sights, enjoy the rides and don't ask too many questions.The plot is not exactly new, a race of aliens have flown millions of light years in giant flying saucers and have their ships hovering over the major cities of the world (But curiously they seem to all be hovered over American landmarks). The reason They have planned a timed attack which is not only affixed to our system of measuring time but is only discovered by one lone guy (Jeff Goldblum) in with a laptop.The movie doesn't deliver anything that couldn't be found in a 50s alien invasion movie or a 70s disaster movie. As for the characters, somebody must have left the floodgates at Central Casting. We get a computer nerd (Goldblum), his Jewish father (Judd Hircsh), a hotshot pilot (Will Smith), The President (Bill Pullman), A wacko scientist (Brent Spiner), a stripper housewife (Vivica A. Fox) and a drunken pilot (Randy Quaid). All that is missing are George Kennedy, Robert Stack, O.J. Simpson, Linda Blair, Shelley Winters and Red Buttons.The invasion scenes don't leave anything new either. Just hundreds of people running and screaming as monuments get blown up one by one and oddly all of them are American. What about the Eiffel Tower, The Taj Mahal, The coliseum, The Great Wall or Barney.What do they want? To kill us of course. The aliens come off in 'Independence Day' like interstellar cockroaches which (if I understood it correctly), find a planet inhabit it and destroy it. I liked the idea that the aliens in David Twohy's 'The Arrival' had much better. They used our environment against us so that they could terraform the earth and take over. Heck even Marvin the Martian had the excuse that our planet was blocking his view of Venus.Even the scene in which we find out their intentions is flat and boring.

And although it offers the same ridiculousness as his other features, it still succeeds as a solid popcorn flick that was once at the forefront of large-scale disaster films.The story concerns an alien invasion against which the entire mankind unite to fight for its freedom. It begins on July 2 when the alien mothership enters the Earth's orbit & deploys several spaceships which take over the major cities of the world & annihilate them completely. On July 3, a counterattack is launched but turns out to be ineffective until a computer expert finds out a flaw in alien's advanced system. And so, July 4 becomes the day when humanity puts up its final fights for its freedom.Direction by Roland Emmerich here is actually top-notch when compared to his other works, writing employs all the flimsy narrative, clichéd dialogues & illogical plot developments, production design is stunning for its magnitude, visual effects were jaw-dropping at its time of release but now looks pretty dated, the camera-work is nicely carried out, editing isn't bad as the story is finely paced & the score by David Arnold has a very patriotic feel to it & keeps the drama flowing with excitement.Coming to the performances, its ensemble cast chips in with adequate contribution in the film & although there was no standout performance by anyone, Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum & Bill Pullman still manage to make their characters work despite the lack of depth & characterization in the script itself.

Yeah, I'm not counting Crystal Skull, but not for the reasons people think. It's just that it's painfully obvious that Skull was probably never meant to be made and that it was supposed to all end in 1989 with this movie. There are actually things I like about Skull, but not this copycat of Raiders of the Lost Ark.The movie starts out with a silly, childish sequence of a Young Indiana Jones (essayed by River Phoenix, who looks NOTHING like a younger version of Harrison Ford) on an exploring trip with his boy scout troop in 1912 Utah, who finds an ancient relic in a cave and is pursued by nefarious villainous types, and goes through all these requisite stunts that mimic action sequences we've already seen in the first 2 movies, but these scenes EXPLAIN Indy's phobias and adult idiosyncrasies. Indy eventually loses the battle, giving up the artifact to the bad guys, but is supposed to have learned a valuable lesson about life....YAWN! We also get a glimpse of Indy's Dad. Flashforward to the film's setting, 1939, where Professor Jones is teaching at university while horny college girls drool over him like a rock star (just like in the original film). Then ANOTHER group of nefarious types approach him about some stone artifact they found in the ocean that is proof of the existence of the Holy Grail, so Indy goes on a trek across the globe (just like in the original film), which encompasses Italy, Germany, and Israel, in search of the Grail. Along for the ride is Indy's Dad Henry Jones (played by Sean Connery in blatant stunt casting), who was the leader of the original mission to find the Grail. And guess how the end up meeting? See, these Nazis are holding Jones Sr. hostage because they are also interested in finding the precious artifact. Does the word Nazi sound familiar? JUST LIKE IN THE ORIGINAL FILM! I'm sensing a trend here. Also, there is the required female sidekick. Of course, it's never a bad idea to have an attractive lady in a movie, but this one is a stereotypical blonde bimbo who is supposed to be some kind of smart DOCTOR. I've seen half-naked Bond girls who are more convincing as smarties than this chick!Speaking of BOND, back to the stunt casting of Connery! This movie shamelessly plays on Ford and Connery's universal appeal by pairing them as son and father, because they bear absolutely NO resemblance to each other. I can suspend disbelief in a movie like Highlander, because there are so many things that movie has going for it other than just Sean Connery, but not in this movie. He is in no way, shape, or form convincing as Indy's Dad. Ford had way more chemistry with his co-stars in the previous 2 movies. The humor between the 2 actors is very strained and not funny, their dialog composed of endless, annoying bickering.The action in this movie is nothing to write home about either. It's amazing, but I actually thought much of the effects in this movie looked incredibly cheesy! And this movie came out years AFTER the first 2 movies, whose effects to this day look fresh and engaging. Then we have the repetitive battles with Nazis. Now, I actually think that Temple of Doom is the best Indy flick, but Raiders still is entertaining with many positives, and at least the villains in that movie had a panache and mystique about them with talented actors playing them with flair, but the villains in this are incredibly stale with no flair.What boggles my mind even more is that there is a healthy amount of fans that actually think THIS awful movie is the BEST of the original trilogy when it is nothing but a sad clone of the Raiders and not nearly as entertaining as Doom! A case where mindless action wins over real filmmaking. Can't win 'em all!

Yeah, I'm not counting Crystal Skull, but not for the reasons people think. It's just that it's painfully obvious that Skull was probably never meant to be made and that it was supposed to all end in 1989 with this movie. There are actually things I like about Skull, but not this copycat of Raiders of the Lost Ark.The movie starts out with a silly, childish sequence of a Young Indiana Jones (essayed by River Phoenix, who looks NOTHING like a younger version of Harrison Ford) on an exploring trip with his boy scout troop in 1912 Utah, who finds an ancient relic in a cave and is pursued by nefarious villainous types, and goes through all these requisite stunts that mimic action sequences we've already seen in the first 2 movies, but these scenes EXPLAIN Indy's phobias and adult idiosyncrasies. Indy eventually loses the battle, giving up the artifact to the bad guys, but is supposed to have learned a valuable lesson about life....YAWN! We also get a glimpse of Indy's Dad. Flashforward to the film's setting, 1939, where Professor Jones is teaching at university while horny college girls drool over him like a rock star (just like in the original film). Then ANOTHER group of nefarious types approach him about some stone artifact they found in the ocean that is proof of the existence of the Holy Grail, so Indy goes on a trek across the globe (just like in the original film), which encompasses Italy, Germany, and Israel, in search of the Grail. Along for the ride is Indy's Dad Henry Jones (played by Sean Connery in blatant stunt casting), who was the leader of the original mission to find the Grail. And guess how the end up meeting? See, these Nazis are holding Jones Sr. hostage because they are also interested in finding the precious artifact. Does the word Nazi sound familiar? JUST LIKE IN THE ORIGINAL FILM!

Wow! Considering the talent involved how did this movie drift, nay, run astray?After reading a number of reviews, the consensus was that the stylistic sets were acceptable for the most part or even seen as a plus for the film, but not so for me. A misfire of a choice for what should have been a traditional Gothic style\/medieval architecture, why argue with success? What did the director et al. do? Sit around thinking how do we reduce the atmosphere of dread, fear and foreboding? And what was the style? Expressionist? Minimalist? It looked like the scenery budget was cut to be able to hire the full lineup of Universal's horror stars. The interiors of the castle looked like they were hastily thrown together in an afternoon. And what happened, couldn't they afford even one fake spiderweb? It was an equally irritating distraction on par with Rathbone's constant barrage of tantrums.The other major misjudgement that irked me was the ending. I was stunned! Besides bringing the monster back to life and so being partially responsible for the deaths that occurred, Wolfie was constantly lying to everybody to keep his secret. But at the end everybody, the police chief, his wife and all the townspeople not only forgive him, they love him, treat him like a hero, having only moments earlier thrown down their scythes, hangman's ropes and such. He must have had quite a PR man. Or maybe it was the caliber of the Frankenstein villagers, hearts so big they explode! ha ha!

She also meets a friendly Scarecrow (Ray Bolger) who tags along in hopes of getting a brain, a Tin Man (Jack Haley; Some singing and dialogue by Buddy Ebsen) who also tags along in hopes of getting a heart, and a Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr) who follows in hopes of getting courage.

If I were to make a list of ways I would deal with a room filling with propane, burning it would rank somewhere below trying to hold my breath for six hours. What's worse, is this actually works without murdering everyone like it would have in the real world.The movies full of little moments like this. There's no real tension because the villains are idiots and a normal person could have waited it out in that room no problem. The only reason there's any conflict is because Jodie Foster is also an idiot.

It's a timeless classic that doesn't feel like it dated a day, only getting better with each passing watch. It is Coopla's magnum opus, showing the potential that cinema has as a storytelling art form. It revolutionised narrative as rather than telling the story of one character, Coopla built up a life style by showing these criminals in both their everyday life and when under threat. The story spans 5 years, showing us every detail of how the mafia operates. We see everything from their joy at a wedding to their shaded business meetings where death is talked about callously without guilt.When violence is used Coppola never holds back. He will show every gruesome detail with faces gasping for oxygen, the blood trickling down their skin and the intense screams of pain of the victims. It is this realism and details that make many of the most memorable scenes as it was one of the first times that a film used such realistic violence. The film probably has one of the greatest casts assembled to a film with so many memorable characters. Even with a 3 hour runtime, many of these characters don't even play that large a role in the story or even get too much screen time. But the actors get their roles down so incredibly that they build their own character through the way they speak or the hesitance of talking against a powerful figure like the godfather. Throughout the film doesn't have a single weak performance. But of course the stand out of the cast was Brando. I remains one of cinemas most memorable performances, with his introducing shot alone being one of the most recognisable images in cinema with his calm reaction to being asked to kill a man. He becomes the image of power inciting fear into even his own assassins who stutter when talking to him. Certainly Brando is the film's most iconic role, though sometimes overlooked is Pacino with one of the most memorable transformations in film going from a respected war veteran to violent crime lord. Far more emotional than his father he is hesitant about violence at first, but quickly becomes accustomed to the violence of his life of crime. By the end of the film he doesn't second think killing his own step brother as an act of vengeance. Pacino was perfect at emphasising this change with both the tone of his voice and rage in his eyes creating the real image of a man who has changed over the years. But it's not quality alone that has made this film so memorable. What makes The Godfather such an icon of cinema because it represents what all films should try to accomplish, by taking risks that no other film would make. Coppola was never afraid to show the detailed violence or take risks by experimenting with narrative, because he wanted to make his own unique vision on screen. It's for this reason that it has become timeless, representing a masterclass in filmmaking and reminding us all of the innovation that makes us love cinema.

In order to get to the truth about a large, illegal toxic waste-dumping scheme, he goes undercover as a handyman in rural Jackson, Kentucky, where the waste is said to be hidden. This toxic waste is causing the townsfolk to develop medical issues, and is even killing them. While Taggart finds friendly locals like Cotton (Stanton), Reverend Goodall (Helm), and Sarah Kellogg (Helgenberger), who he forges a relationship with, he does end up with a lot of opposition to his even being in their supposedly quiet little town. As it turns out, the sinister Orin Hanner (Kristofferson) is a corporate bigwig who is using the townspeople of Jackson as his own personal enforcers against Taggart so he can continue to make millions with his waste-dumping scheme. But Taggart vows to end this cycle of corruption and misery - by any means necessary. Will Taggart and his friends triumph over the forces of environmental evil? Find out today! You know, it's a funny thing...we've been so conditioned by Seagal's latter-day efforts, that we assumed watching this older Seagal vehicle was going to be a crud-filled slog filled to the brim with mind-numbing stupidity. But we were very much refreshed and relieved to find out...wait for it...that Fire Down Below is actually a solid, worthwhile, and entertaining movie. Yes, that seems shocking, but that's only based on the 2014 view of Seagal. Hark back to a time when he was a little thinner, his movies went to the theater, and the major studios ensured some level of professional quality. Seagal is as likable as Seagal gets, and he even smiles a few times. Plus his jackets are truly amazing fashion pieces. (Hence, we ventured a supposition that his full name in the movie was Jacket Taggart). This was in Seagal's Environmental phase, where he wore buckskin coats and all his movies had to be about pollution or rainforests or something. Somehow his interest in that seems to have faded, as his latter-day DTV efforts seem to have him more as an unlikable thug.If Hard Target was Van Damme's Bayou movie, than Fire Down Below is Seagal's answer to that. There's plenty of banjo-pickin' country music on the soundtrack (a lot of which is by Seagal himself, with none other than Todd Smallwood of Street Knight musical fame...what an amazing team-up!), and the first image of the movie is highly reminiscent of the cover of classic SNES game Phalanx. But the idea of a butt-kicking EPA agent who becomes Undercover Handyman is an enjoyable idea, but the whole classic corrupt small town feels very familiar.But here's the bottom line as we see it Because this is a rural movie, which is very well-shot and has a nice atmosphere, and has a refreshing emphasis on actual characters, it seems the movie as a whole would have gotten more recognition and critical acclaim had it starred Billy Bob Thornton or Ed Harris instead of Steven Seagal. Take out some of the action scenes, and this could have worked well as a low-key drama like Chrystal, Paris Trout or Sling Blade. But because this is a Seagal movie, it ran into a dilemma As a drama, it's not going to please drama fans, and as a straight-up action movie, it runs the risk of upsetting action buffs who have to have everything go at a breakneck pace with tons of brutal violence. We suppose the intended audience is...us, really, because we appreciate actual storytelling, atmosphere, and characters, as well as action. But we applaud Seagal and the rest of the cast for actually trying to make something respectable and not your average crud.So set your newly-minted (and extremely warranted) modern-day Seagal prejudices aside and feel free to delve into the world of classic, pre-obese Seagal.
