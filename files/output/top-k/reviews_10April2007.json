When she reveals that she unknowingly released the white-headed fly that could reverse his hideous mistake, Andre rises angrily from his desk, and we notice that his left hand has been hideously replaced by a hairy insect claw. Immediately, we understand that something truly horrific has happened to Helene's beloved husband.Until this second moment, Andre has been very careful to keep his appearance hidden from his wife (and from us).

A film that addressed the condition of autism long before Rain Man did (and much better too than that overrated Oscar winner). The tale of an autistic boy, Eric (Jay Underwood) who believes he can fly, and his neighbour Milly Michaelson (a sweetly appealing Lucy Deakins) who forms a friendship that blossoms into love.Eric has been autistic since his parents died in a plane crash when he was five. Ever since, he's imagined he can fly like a plane (possibly so he could save his parents), sitting on the windowsill of his bedroom or standing on the roof of his house, getting ready to take off. Eric is in danger of being institutionalised. He doesn't speak a word to anyone. Not even to his own uncle Hugo (amusingly played by the late Fred Gwynne), who cares for Eric, and drinks more than he should.Milly has just moved in next door with her widowed mother Charlene (another fine performance from Bonnie Bedelia) and her brother Louis (a groan inducing Fred Savage). She becomes fascinated with Eric, and cares for him a great deal. She's not sure if she believes Hugo's stories that Eric can really fly, but when she falls from an overpass, and somehow survives, she slowly convinces herself Eric has the gift of flight.I really did enjoy The Boy Who Could Fly. There's a wonderful simplicity to its storytelling, and thanks to director Nick Castle's confident and assured grasp of narrative, its a rewarding experience. Sadly, Castle never really distinguished himself in the following 90s with anything particularly worthwhile. Only this film, and his previous venture, The Last Starfighter (an equally underrated film) are films that really stand out.Castle finds just the right tone and sense of whimsy. In some ways, its almost a Spielbergian story. But it hardly ever lapses into slush and over-sentimentality. I could have done without Fred Savage's unnecessary subplot about finding the courage to ride around the block on his bike, and the ending does somewhat surrender itself to full blown fantasy, but up until then, TBWCF seldom puts a foot wrong.Really, the only problem I have with the film is when it outright embraces the fantastical. When I saw TBWCF for the first time, I assumed Eric's desire of flight was a metaphor for freedom. That on the outside he's cut off from everybody. But on the inside, his mind is free and perfectly clear. In fact, if the film had stayed true to those conceits, I probably would have gave it 10\/10.But unfortunately, TBWCF chooses to stray too closely to fantasy. Midway, there is a scene when we see Milly flying with Eric. Now that scene in of itself works quite well. It seems very magical (although the moment they kiss in a background of a fireworks display is overdoing it) and hits an uplifting note, but when its revealed to just be a dream, I liked the ambiguity to it. It adds an air of mystery that permeates the film.Its just unfortunate that for all the deft direction Castle displays beforehand, he chooses to cop out with an ending that's pure escapism. If the climax had some of the same mystery the rest of the film had, it would have made Eric's departure even more powerful.But still, TBWCF has much to recommend it. The performances are uniformly excellent. Lucy Deakins is a wonderful young actress. She has charm, grace and a genuine sense of sweetness. What a shame she hasn't gone on to the acting career she richly deserves. And Jay Underwood is a master of minimalism.

A film that addressed the condition of autism long before Rain Man did (and much better too than that overrated Oscar winner). The tale of an autistic boy, Eric (Jay Underwood) who believes he can fly, and his neighbour Milly Michaelson (a sweetly appealing Lucy Deakins) who forms a friendship that blossoms into love.Eric has been autistic since his parents died in a plane crash when he was five. Ever since, he's imagined he can fly like a plane (possibly so he could save his parents), sitting on the windowsill of his bedroom or standing on the roof of his house, getting ready to take off. Eric is in danger of being institutionalised. He doesn't speak a word to anyone. Not even to his own uncle Hugo (amusingly played by the late Fred Gwynne), who cares for Eric, and drinks more than he should.Milly has just moved in next door with her widowed mother Charlene (another fine performance from Bonnie Bedelia) and her brother Louis (a groan inducing Fred Savage). She becomes fascinated with Eric, and cares for him a great deal. She's not sure if she believes Hugo's stories that Eric can really fly, but when she falls from an overpass, and somehow survives, she slowly convinces herself Eric has the gift of flight.I really did enjoy The Boy Who Could Fly. There's a wonderful simplicity to its storytelling, and thanks to director Nick Castle's confident and assured grasp of narrative, its a rewarding experience. Sadly, Castle never really distinguished himself in the following 90s with anything particularly worthwhile. Only this film, and his previous venture, The Last Starfighter (an equally underrated film) are films that really stand out.Castle finds just the right tone and sense of whimsy. In some ways, its almost a Spielbergian story. But it hardly ever lapses into slush and over-sentimentality. I could have done without Fred Savage's unnecessary subplot about finding the courage to ride around the block on his bike, and the ending does somewhat surrender itself to full blown fantasy, but up until then, TBWCF seldom puts a foot wrong.Really, the only problem I have with the film is when it outright embraces the fantastical. When I saw TBWCF for the first time, I assumed Eric's desire of flight was a metaphor for freedom. That on the outside he's cut off from everybody. But on the inside, his mind is free and perfectly clear. In fact, if the film had stayed true to those conceits, I probably would have gave it 10\/10.But unfortunately, TBWCF chooses to stray too closely to fantasy. Midway, there is a scene when we see Milly flying with Eric. Now that scene in of itself works quite well. It seems very magical (although the moment they kiss in a background of a fireworks display is overdoing it) and hits an uplifting note, but when its revealed to just be a dream, I liked the ambiguity to it. It adds an air of mystery that permeates the film.Its just unfortunate that for all the deft direction Castle displays beforehand, he chooses to cop out with an ending that's pure escapism. If the climax had some of the same mystery the rest of the film had, it would have made Eric's departure even more powerful.But still, TBWCF has much to recommend it. The performances are uniformly excellent. Lucy Deakins is a wonderful young actress. She has charm, grace and a genuine sense of sweetness. What a shame she hasn't gone on to the acting career she richly deserves. And Jay Underwood is a master of minimalism.

She's got the look but I have to hold my breath every time she tries to act... It's quite exhausting to watch her act in this role. Hope it's just me.But the story writing fits perfectly with the title China Box. You have to have enough background knowledge and sensibility to appreciate it. The movie never falls into the cliché of east-meets-the-west. Instead, it uses the historical sea-change in Hong Kong as the back drop, as the grand orchestra accompanying the extraordinary solo of the age old story of love, a man and a woman. Nothing is obvious, and nothing gives away in the middle and the tension keeps building till the very last moment. I first saw the movie when it came out in theater. But 10 years later I saw it again on tape, it blew me away like no other. I'd give it a 10 if not for the rather limited acting skill from Gong Li. There's got to be someone else out there among the 1.3 billion who can really act. Maggie can act but she certainly falls short in her natural beauty for this role, in comparison to Gong Li. One other thing I thought was bit of a drag is Maggie's almost perfect English. I thought a character from the very bottom of Hong Kong society with limited education probably would be more convincing if she has more local accent. That's my past experience with folks from Hong Kong. Only those from the privileged the class in Hong Kong would speak like her in the movie... I am so disappointed by the featured review on IMDb here. Because in the past this web site has consistently picked a more sensible review for other movies I ran into. I felt rather compelled to write something to clear the bad rap of this great movie, as much as I can. For those who cares, Maggie Cheung was in another great movie In the Mood for Love (2000). But that movie was more limited in scope and more nuanced in its presentation, a more oriental romance. This movie clearly more European is breadth and depth in its attempt. Some might find the political overtone - a rather negative focus on the 1997 handover (suicide, etc), a bit predictable and cliché. But in this particular movie it does set the mood for the over all theme of the movie - after all, this is a rather a sad romance. No happy endings for any one. Only human spirit triumph. For that, I thought the movie title is a bit off actually. IMHO, China Box is only a clever device that is seemingly simple but capable of endless intrigue and twist. That title would be much more fit for a thriller. This one I thought is more about the ultimate triumph of the unyielding human spirit for truth, for real meaning, and for love as the word originally meant, overcoming all odds, even the limitation of one's unavoidable mortality.It's a master piece.

He also appeared in a cameo at the tail-end of Sweet Charity, another of my favorites. Given that little resume of movie roles, he has forever won a place in my heart, as has this movie.Harold and Maude is a modest little masterpiece from Hal Ashby, and deserves to be viewed as more than just an eccentric little cult hit appreciated by an elite few. It's hard to think of another movie whose success relies so entirely upon its pitch-perfect tone. Ashby's film walks a tightrope between black (almost too black) comedy and sentimental (almost too sentimental) pathos, but manages to blend the two perfectly to produce something quite unlike anything else I've ever seen.Harold is a gloomy misfit with a morbid death obsession, who likes to stage his own fake suicides in order to win the attention of his dithery and oblivious mother (Vivian Pickles, in an uproarious performance). He meets Maude (Ruth Gordon), an eccentric old lady with a taste for fast driving and an unparalleled lust for life. Maude teaches Harold how to enjoy the world around him instead of letting it slowly pass him by, while Harold gives Maude someone to share her days with. It's an achingly beautiful movie, in a low-key kind of way. Ashby is the king of understatement, and everything, both the outrageous comedy and the tender, sad moments, are delivered simply and effectively. He's got great actors in a great story, and he trusts both enough to stand back and let them work their magic.Ruth Gordon gives one of my favorite film performances of all time as Maude. It would be easy to dismiss her role as easy, if it were not for those quiet moments when Maude lets her enthusiastic guard down and we get glimpses of some sadness in her life that she's made a willful decision not to let overcome her. There are moments in this movie that actually made me think differently about the world we live in. Just for an example, there's a scene when Harold and Maude are sitting by a pond, and Harold gives Maude a ring he won for her in a carnival. She clutches it to her chest, thanks him for it, and then throws it into the water. Harold at first looks outraged that she would throw his gift away. But she says, Now I'll always know where it is, and Harold's hurt look transforms into a smile of understanding. If I could think about life the way the character of Maude does in this movie, I know I would be a happier person.Harold and Maude is a shining gem from the 1970s, and one of those movies I just have to watch every once in a while. Along with the two leads, there's of course Pickles' off-the-wall performance, and very funny support from actors in minor roles, like Harold's therapist (sagging buttocks) and his war-crazed uncle. Plus, there's the wonderful score comprised of Cat Stevens songs, which caps off the tone of the movie beautifully.Grade A+ ","genre":null},{"date":"10 April 2007","score":"9 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" Bud Cort appeared in two of my favorite (and two of the quirkiest) movies from the 1970s Harold and Maude and Brewster McCloud.

Then threaten to detonate them if they aren't paid, like cable TV, a monthly fee of 100 million dollars. Jean-Clude Van Damme is Marcus Ray a shady businessman who exports knockoff running shoes and jeans who gets involved up to his neck in the action. This happens when it's found out that his partner in crime the lovable and wise-cracking Tommy Hendricks, Rob Schneider, is an undercover CIA agent planning to get the goods on him, as well as his associates, in the illegal knockoff business.It soon becomes evident that knockoffs aren't the only headache on the minds of the CIA. It's found that their, the knockoff clothes and toys, are being used as explosives by the Russian mobster and suddenly Ray becomes a good guy in stopping, together with Hendricks, that from happening. Still Ray is hamstrung by ambitious CIA agent Karen Lee, Lela Rochon, who's playing double-agent in the film. This confuses both Ray & Hndricks to the point where all thee almost end up shooting each other.***SPOILER ALERT***It turns out that the person behind this evil and grandiose plan is non other then the CIA chief in charge of covert Hong Kong operations himself chubby Harry Johnson, Paul Sorvino, who together with even chubbier Hong Kong crime kingpin Slim, Glen Chin,are working together with the evil Russians in this crazy and off the wall criminal venture. The mindless action is almost non-stop in the movie with Ray going from rickshaw races to food fights and warehouse shootouts and finally a showdown with the Russians. This happens on an outgoing freighter loaded with bomb laden ripoffs headed for US Pacific port cities to unload and, by remote satellite control, activate them.People in the movie seem to be killed over and over again coming back for more like walking dead zombies especially the Russian mobsters. Who have, for what at first seems like no reason at all,hoods over their heads. Later you realize that it, the hoods, were just there so you won't see or recognize them coming back to get themselves killed, by Ray & Co, all over again sometimes as much as three or four times. The leader of the Slavic mobsters himself is done in a number of times by both Ray & Lee only to come back for more. Thats until Ray, out of sheer frustration, finally finishes him off much like he would have done to a vampire. But not with the usual wooden stake driven through his heart but with a ten ton steel cargo container dropped square on top of his head!All kinds of wild and far out zany camera angles make you dizzy following the non-stop action scenes with bad guy CIA turncoat Johnson getting the worst of it. Johnson gets knocked around all over the place then set on fire, with a bottle of deadly sulfuric acid, and then killed in a freighter explosion. Just when you thought the movie and Johnson were history he again killed in another explosion in his Hong Kong hideout. Johnson who at that point seemed to have come back from the dead has the same crazed and manic look in both scenes in both scenes that he was killed.

This is due to the fact that often they are little more than grand and visionary images repeated over and over. So, keeping that in mind, some friends are surprised I regard this title as a nearly perfect black comedy. Look at the cast though, everyone plays their roles with deadly serious poise and the hero is a murderous genius! Not so much that we are intended to love Phibes as a character (and we are), but he is far too charismatic and inventive not to like.Trout is investigating the curious deaths of a few doctors around London when he comes to the conclusion that something is amiss. The first two really do not peak his interest, even though one man was stung to death by a swarm of bees (boils) in his room and another ripped to shreds by bats. Might I remind you, these deaths occurred in the middle of London. Not precisely the sort of locale that supports populations of killer bees or genetically engineered bats. Work with me here, Flying Foxes are really too cute for the bloodthirsty part they play, but something scratched that man to death. Anyway, Pike - I mean Trout, realizes that foul business is afoot when one man has his skull crushed by a mechanical frog mask.Victoria Phibes died during an operation (exactly what is not explained) and her grieving husband was presumed dead after his car drove off a cliff and burned. Unfortunately for the doctors, the man either has the greatest immune system ever known or is an undead avenger (I'm partial to the latter explanation myself). Biding his time, he devised a fiendish plan to kill anyone involved with Victoria's death. Nothing simple like a knife or bullet either. Phibes will visit a deadly plague, derived from what Moses called down upon the Pharaoh, on each and every person.We, the audience, are privy to the extraordinary lengths Dr. Phibes is going to for revenge. Whether he is intensely playing the pipe organ that dominates the grand ballroom of his hideout or gracefully dancing with Vulnavia, the man has style. Nobody else is there to see, save the incredible clockwork musicians playing music, so the performances solely gratify Phibes' strange tastes.Probably the most chilling end is that of Dr. Longstreet. Lulled into a dreamy state by Vulnavia, he allows himself to be bound to a chair. Then Phibes walks in and fixes the old horny coot with a reproachful stare (I love the look he gives the victims) before inserting a large needle into the man's arm. Attached to the tube is a pint jar and the glass container begins to fill as Phibes slowly works the pump. He artfully drains every single drop of blood from the poor man, leaving him a gray husk and placing all eight pints on the mantel. I've watched hundreds of slasher flicks and few scenes have ever really deserved a second thought. Watching a man's blood being leisurely pumped from his body made my hair stand on end.Gruesome as it may be, the last victim's end provides Trout with a much-needed clue. Phibes had a set of pendants specially made; each has a Hebrew symbol representing one of the plagues. He wears the respective pendant when executing each sentence and lost the one for blood during Longstreet's initial thrashing. Between visiting a jeweler and a Rabbi, the inspector is able to start piecing things together. Fat lot of good it will do.Impressive powers of deduction (actually he or one of his servants spent hours sorting through folders) enable Vesalius to volunteer that all the deceased were involved in the failed surgery on Victoria Phibes. Despite knowing this, two more are killed before the authorities get the remainder under police protection. Still no good; Trout and another inspector actually open the door for number seven when a brass unicorn head (beasts) is catapulted across the street, skewering him.

Well, this film actually, but it is pretty darn amusing. The acting is really something else, half the time I'm wondering why He-Man sounds so damn happy. Considering that Castle Greyskull has fallen to a surprise attack by Skeletor and the Sorceress is his prisoner, this guy should be a little worried.Soon he discovers how the forces of evil penetrated their defenses, a slightly insane Dwarf who created the ultimate key. This key, which sounds like it was manufactured by Yamaha, can open anything - even doorways between dimensions. Which is how the group ends up on Earth, though the device which brought them there lands some distance away.This gives a neat reason to include a budding Courteney (not a joke about her breasts, well maybe) and her A-Ha idolizing boyfriend, because they find the Cosmic Key and immediately begin playing with it.Skeletor's forces lock in on the signals and battles rage through the suburbs. Surprise, surprise the good guys lose the first encounter and He-Man is taken in chains back to Greyskull, everyone else is left alive on Earth to rot.Of course Gwildor MacGuyvers up a makeshift Cosmic key and Kevin remembers the song to open the gateway to Eternia. He-Man sees his friends, breaks free, and recovers his sword for a final battle with a Skeletor (who has just absorbed the power of the universe, as if that would matter. He's the BAD guy, Dolph is the GOOD guy - he's screwed).Okay, the film is very predictable, but combine the premise with a motivating fantasy score and I start cracking up. They should play this music in mental wards, though having two hundred people in gowns acting like Conan would probably be bad...

It is nothing but outlandish and terroristic. It takes all Jack Nicholson can give to make these characters in anyway palatable, and even so. In the Prizzi family all other considerations than the family is outlawed, except maybe for a couple of weeks and the woman concerned by this out-breeding passing passion has to submit and take the color of the wall on which she is being pinned. If she does not then she will be executed and cut off. There is no depth in that film, no subtleties or even subtlety. Get the message, bang it down on the table and then cram it down your brain. Business is business and in-breeding is the rule. I will always wonder why a hit-woman with a reputation of efficiency and effectiveness misses her husband when he intends to kill her though she manages to shoot one bullet first. Suspend your disbelief and incredulity. The cinema is the new church of the visual dominant animal man is. To see is to believe. But at times to believe is easier when you are blind, and probably deaf too. Apart from that it is interesting even if we do spend a little bit too much time in planes going east and planes going west, kind of an airlift between New York, or whatever may titillate you, and Los Angeles, or whatever it takes to please you.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne ","genre":null},{"date":"10 April 2007","score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" When the mafia becomes the argument of an action film and little more it is no longer funny, it is no longer strange, it is no longer fascinating.

And its release last year came at a time when Senator Bob Dole and other politicians chastised the entertainment industry for promoting sex and violence. But if Showgirls is any indication of Hollywood's future, the folks in Washington should focus their attack on a more dangerous threat to American values--bad movie-making.Showgirls is a relentlessly exploitive look at the Las Vegas strip scene, and the film turns out to be just as trashy as its subject matter. Director Paul Verhoeven and writer Joe Eszterhas, who collaborated on another shock-value project, 1992's Basic Instinct, follow the plight of a young woman (teen TV star Elizabeth Berkley) determined to make a name for herself as a topless dancer. It's a hackneyed premise to begin with, so not surprisingly, all of the stock characters are trucked out. There's the Demanding Producer. The Loyal Friend. The Bitchy Competitor. Lest I forget the Scummy Club Owner.Of course, any attempt at character development or a coherent storyline is just window dressing for the film's main attraction--an endless parade of full-frontal nudity. Unfortunately, Showgirls doesn't satisfy in this department. Verhoeven's slam-bang, in-your-face style of direction proves neither arousing nor erotic. To make matters worse, you'll be forced to sit through the movie's clothed scenes, which don't cover up for laughable acting and some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken in film history.
