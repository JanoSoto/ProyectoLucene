He has the traditional superhero accouterments distinctive costume, unique weapon, mild-mannered secret identity - and yet he's far from superhuman. He wounds, falls, and fails just as much as any of us.Here we have a guy who's basically just as weak and fallible as any real-life human, who is constantly thrust into larger-than-life situations that are consequently a little too much for him.

Director Steven Spielberg and best-selling author Michael Crichton, who collaborated on the superlative Jurassic Park (1993) and the knockout sequel The Lost World (1997), had something to say about scientists who play God and the dangers of cloning. Sadly, Spielberg and Crichton had nothing to do with this sequel. Former Star Wars art director Joe Johnston of October Sky (1999), The Rocketeer (1991), and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (1989) replaced Spielberg. You'd think Johnston's experience on Jumanji (1995) where zoo animals stomped everything in sight, would have made him an ideal candidate. Unfortunately, it didn't. You can count the major differences between Johnston's Jurassic Park and Spielberg's Jurassic Parks in minutes. JP3 clocks in at about 90 minutes, while both Spielberg epics exceeded two hours. Although it isn't as pretentious as the first two movies, JP3 relies far more on humor than horror to its detriment. This lukewarm, less-than-savage installment in the cloned-dinosaurs-run-amok series makes references to its predecessors that only hardcore, nitpicking Jurassic Park fans could catch. The joke about Jack Horner was cute. The dinosaurs are just as menacing, even though bloodthirsty moviegoers may feel cheated. (Imagine what Italian gorefest cult director Lucio Fulci would have done with a Jurassic Park movie.) Missing this time around is 'chaos theoretician' Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum of Independence Day), who enlivened both the original and the follow-up with his sarcasm. Paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill of Jurassic Park), who skipped out on The Lost World, returns as the dullest of dull heroes, while Grant's former colleague Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern of October Sky) reappears in a welcome cameo. Grant visits her in the opening scene and finds her happily married to a U.S. State Department official with a toddler son and baby daughter. Before she waves goodbye, Ellie reminds Grant to call her if he ever needs her help. Predictably, freshman scenarist Peter Buchman, along with writers Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor of Election and Citizen Ruth don't let her welsh on her promise. Film scriptwriting manuals classify this as 'foreshadowing,' setting up some future action so it doesn't appear to haphazardly pop up out of the blue.Basically, JP3 follows the formula that Jurassic Park and The Lost World created with greater detail and daring. Reportedly, after Johnston perused the shooting script, he tore it up and ordered rushed rewrites. If this was the best they could contrive, no wonder JP3 is so forgettable. Not only did The Lost World raise the stakes, but it also surpassed the original with its thrills and chills. Clearly, the third time wasn't the charm. Jurassic Park 3 is as pedestrian as Jaws 3. If you've seen the others, you know Laura Dern's cameo at the outset is standard Jurassic Park practice. In The Lost World, Malcolm reunited briefly with John Hammond (Richard Attenborough of The Great Escape) and his grandchildren Timothy 'Tim' Murphy (Joseph Mazzello) and Alexis 'Lex' Murphy (Ariana Richards) in an early scene. Children cannot die in the Jurassic Park franchise. Neither apparently can mother nor fathers. So much for suspense. Like Jurassic Park, Jurassic Park 3 has our desperate heroes plundering piles of dinosaur dung in search of a satellite phone that could serve as their salvation. That stinking satellite phone infuriated me initially when I heard it ring. I figured that some fool had left their cell phone ringer on in the theatre! Nevertheless, Sarah Harding owned a tattered camera bag she called her lucky bag, just as Belly Brennan sorts a similar camera bag. The scene where Tea Leoni hangs from a tree as ravenous raptors leap up at her alludes to the kitchen scene near the end of Jurassic Park. Instead of being jostling about in small recreational vehicles, Dr. Grant finds himself slammed around in the wrecked fuselage of a plane by a dinosaur. This scene lacks the sheer terror of the T-Rex's introduction in Jurassic Park and doesn't generate the suspense of The Lost World cliffhanger scene. Billy steals raptor eggs, and the mothers pursue them across Isla Sorna in a variation on The Lost World heroes that freed an injured T-Rex baby with a broken leg and found its irate mother pushing their motor home over a cliff. The Lost World T-Rexes subjected the motor home to more hair-raising demolition than the JP3 T-Rex does to the plane. This time around baby Pterodactyls attack a teenager, much as The Lost World lizards swarmed after a little rich girl. The major revelation here is the raptors can communicate with each other and might possibly have supplanted primates. Wait, didn't those same raptors communicate with each other back in Jurassic Park in the kitchen scene? Jurassic Park and The Lost World definitely weren't for the squeamish, but Jurassic Park 3 should give nobody nightmares. As in the first two entries, the genetically engineered dinosaurs walk tough, howl vividly, and snap up hapless humans in their jaws. Indeed, the visual effects technology has improved exponentially; sadly, the art of scriptwriting has regressed just as much. Unlike Spielberg, Johnston takes neither the plot nor the stakes to a higher level. Moreover, nothing in Jurassic Park 3 matches either the T-Rex gobbling up the lawyer, Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero of Get Shorty), in the original or the scenes from The Lost World where two T-Rexes tore poor Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff) apart. Grant calls Ellie when a real dino tries to chomp and\/or drown everybody. Hilariously, her young son delays taking her the phone so he can watch his favorite Barney the Purple Dinosaur episode! The out of place Barney scene deflates any suspense or tension that the Site B dinosaur causes as he rips away at a cage housing our heroes.

I had only seen four of his films and given each and every one of them my highest rating. His greatest, and undoubtedly his most popular film was in 1954 epic Seven Samurai, which was the top-selling movie out of Japan for the year and won the Japanese Academy Award for Best Picture. Today, it's ranked one of the greatest motion pictures ever. And it rightfully holds that title.This is a spectacular film. Full of wonderful characters, spectacular scenery, and great performances all around, it is Kurosawa's fantastic story about a poor farming village in 16th century Japan being consistently placed under attack by marauding bandits. Facing starvation if the bandits raid them again, the peasants fearfully and reluctantly turn to seven unemployed samurai to defend themselves.There is no weak element to Seven Samurai. One of its greatest aspects is its characters. Every single one of them, farmer or samurai, is given tremendous development, making them memorable. This is one of those films where if a character gets killed off, you suddenly find yourselves missing their presence on film because you got to know them so well. I will not name him, but there was one ill-fated character in the film when, after he died, I felt kind of cheerless because I had come to respect him as a human being instead of an actor performing in front of a camera and reading out scripted dialogue. If you were to ask me which character was my favorite, I would be tied between two of them. The characters played by Takashi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune, two of the finest Japanese actors who ever lived.Another thing I admire in Seven Samurai is the feeling of authenticity. The feeling that it all could have really happened. There are very few moments where the unbelievable occurs, as most action movies tend to succumb to. One thing I admired was the antagonists of the film the bandits. Unlike most Hollywood movies where the bad guys have names and are introduced as characters to make them effective, the bandits in Seven Samurai all go without names. We only know them as the bandits and that is appropriate because that's all the characters know them as. Just marauding, murdering bandits who must be killed off as soon as possible.Kurosawa was undoubtedly one of the most influential directors of all time and that is clear in this film. Many of the transitions and techniques that motion pictures today seem to follow on a conventional level were inspired by this film slow-motion, a fade wipe between scenes like what you see in the Star Wars movies, using the weather to affect emotion and atmosphere, a team forming to take on a larger enemy, the list goes on. The movie was so influential that it was remade here in the United States as The Magnificent Seven (1960), which I consider one of the greatest remakes ever. Not as good as its original source&#151;not by a long shot&#151;but considerably effective and noteworthy.In regards to the movie's soundtrack, it's a success. The music was composed by Fumio Hayasaka and it's wonderful. We seldom hear any of it, when we do, its an efficacious presence of impact. The opening score is very effective and the music that plays when the farmers are searching for samurai in the town remains one of my favorite soundtrack pieces today.There is one thing in the film that might warn off some viewers. It is long. At over three and a half hours in length, some people will be cautious before sitting down to view it and some will lose their patience, but to those who can sit down and enjoy a movie no matter how long it lasts, it will be realized as fast-moving storytelling. Like The Ten Commandments (1956), even the long takes and the slow pacing seems fast because it is so well-written and so masterfully directed by Kurosawa.One of the greatest masterpieces of all time.

I will not name him, but there was one ill-fated character in the film when, after he died, I felt kind of cheerless because I had come to respect him as a human being instead of an actor performing in front of a camera and reading out scripted dialogue. If you were to ask me which character was my favorite, I would be tied between two of them. The characters played by Takashi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune, two of the finest Japanese actors who ever lived.Another thing I admire in Seven Samurai is the feeling of authenticity. The feeling that it all could have really happened. There are very few moments where the unbelievable occurs, as most action movies tend to succumb to. One thing I admired was the antagonists of the film the bandits. Unlike most Hollywood movies where the bad guys have names and are introduced as characters to make them effective, the bandits in Seven Samurai all go without names. We only know them as the bandits and that is appropriate because that's all the characters know them as. Just marauding, murdering bandits who must be killed off as soon as possible.Kurosawa was undoubtedly one of the most influential directors of all time and that is clear in this film. Many of the transitions and techniques that motion pictures today seem to follow on a conventional level were inspired by this film slow-motion, a fade wipe between scenes like what you see in the Star Wars movies, using the weather to affect emotion and atmosphere, a team forming to take on a larger enemy, the list goes on. The movie was so influential that it was remade here in the United States as The Magnificent Seven (1960), which I consider one of the greatest remakes ever. Not as good as its original source&#151;not by a long shot&#151;but considerably effective and noteworthy.In regards to the movie's soundtrack, it's a success. The music was composed by Fumio Hayasaka and it's wonderful. We seldom hear any of it, when we do, its an efficacious presence of impact. The opening score is very effective and the music that plays when the farmers are searching for samurai in the town remains one of my favorite soundtrack pieces today.There is one thing in the film that might warn off some viewers. It is long. At over three and a half hours in length, some people will be cautious before sitting down to view it and some will lose their patience, but to those who can sit down and enjoy a movie no matter how long it lasts, it will be realized as fast-moving storytelling. Like The Ten Commandments (1956), even the long takes and the slow pacing seems fast because it is so well-written and so masterfully directed by Kurosawa.One of the greatest masterpieces of all time.

I had only seen four of his films and given each and every one of them my highest rating. His greatest, and undoubtedly his most popular film was in 1954 epic Seven Samurai, which was the top-selling movie out of Japan for the year and won the Japanese Academy Award for Best Picture. Today, it's ranked one of the greatest motion pictures ever. And it rightfully holds that title.This is a spectacular film. Full of wonderful characters, spectacular scenery, and great performances all around, it is Kurosawa's fantastic story about a poor farming village in 16th century Japan being consistently placed under attack by marauding bandits. Facing starvation if the bandits raid them again, the peasants fearfully and reluctantly turn to seven unemployed samurai to defend themselves.There is no weak element to Seven Samurai. One of its greatest aspects is its characters. Every single one of them, farmer or samurai, is given tremendous development, making them memorable.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"17 March 2009","score":"","review":" After the decline of ballrooms as a popular night out, partner dance enjoyed a revival with the rise of mambo and various forms of salsa in the US. The Eighties also saw an upsurge of partner dance in Britain with the development of modern jive, a simple dance that anyone could learn. Tapping into this enthusiasm comes Dirty Dancing (1987), a well-constructed if cheesy love story that has partner dance at its core. Fronted by the charismatic Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, it also contains a note of rebelliousness that appeals to its teenage target audience.The opening credits (in luminous pink) set the tone with sepia shots of sexy dance routines, slowed down to emphasise sensuousness. The Sixties Ronettes song, Be My Baby, hearkens back to an era before the Beatles, before the death of Kennedy.Baby - the insultingly diminutive name for the heroine (Grey) - is a young girl ahead of her time. She can't wait to join the Peace Corps. But for now, she is being whisked off to summer camp with her protective parents and her superficial sister, Lisa. Baby's going to change the world, quips her father, whereas Lisa's going to decorate it...At the camp, glamorous female dance teacher Penny (Cynthia Rhodes) has the job of making staid dances, like line dancing, look appealing to the masses. Baby, however, chances upon the staff's private party, where a much raunchier dance is practiced. Johnny Castle (Swayze) is a downtrodden instructor from the streets. In contrast to the Harvard and Yale educated (and outwardly respectable) youngsters, he is labelled with an unfairly bad reputation and with strict instructions not to flirt with guests. As Castle and Baby follow their hearts, each striving towards a moral high ground forsaken by society, they are drawn inevitably together.Why such a formulaic and much copied movie has held such fascination is sometimes a mystery. Its strengths are the tightness of its construction and the first rate dancing abilities of its stars. With the gradual demise of studio based song-and-dance films, associated with Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly, came a shortage of stars who could both dance well and act. Swayze not only had considerable acting experience, but was born into a dance family and trained with the prestigious Joffrey Ballet School. As is evident from the companion (dance instruction) video, Swayze Dancing, he toned down his abilities as a dancer to play Castle, but still looks riveting.Mambo, which can be performed in a very erotic and sensual manner, is sometimes called diabolo - the devil's dance. Unlike many dance\/romance movies that followed, this one features many actual dance sequences, augmented by a spontaneous style of acting, but with the dancing obviously performed for real, rather than produced as a result of extensive fast editing cuts, as was the case, for instance, in films like Chicago (2002).The dirty dancing in the film is ultimately a mix of styles, principally mambo and showcase, which provided momentum for many of the popular dance schools of the time and in the years that followed. The film is part of the wave of Eighties indie films that convinced the big studios to diversify and join forces with independents to capture teen audiences. Its sexiness combines with a James Dean style defiance, appealing to male fantasies.While Dirty Dancing lacks greatness, its enduring qualities are too easily overlooked. If nothing else, it provided a template for dozens of lacklustre movies that followed its song and storyline formula without emulating its strengths.Written by Alexandra D.
