The scene also made me think that our educational system is set up like that on Metropolis.

I liked Freder the best because he felt sympathy for the workers, unlike his father, John Fredersen (who ran Metropolis). He (Freder) even offered to work one of the machines for a tired worker. That shows great sympathy I think.Also, I liked how they introduced a staple of modern sci-fi films, the robot.

I ruminated over the events of the film, and I began to tear up a bit. It creates one of the most unsettling atmospheres ever to exist in a film.

Out of the ones with whom I am familiar, I don't think that there is another Hitchcock heroine who was as well developed. Kim Novak's character Judy from Vertigo was close, and so was Janet Leigh's character Marion Crane from Psycho. Those two heroines provoked great pity in my soul. But the heroine of Rebecca beats them all.I was completely involved with her. She begins as little more than a slave to a domineering woman, Edythe van Hopper (their relationship was a little confusing to me; a hired friend? This made me suspicious.

His predicament became more interesting near the end, but my sympathies, my whole attention were squarely focused on Fontaine's character. Thus arose my initial impression of the film. This small disruption can be forgiven, because the film as a whole just remains in my mind as a sad, beautiful masterpiece.Rebecca is one of Hitchcock's best films. Definitely a 10\/10.

It's nice that they explained alot of the first film more indepth and we get some true insight to our killers motives.

I would recommend this to anyone who's seen the first but take the others at your own risk. One more note,the director Rick Rosenthal also directed Bad Boys with Sean Penn.

There are more holes in the plot than a fishing net. Every scene is highly predictable,the light witty lines are far too few, the overuse of the MI latex face, and excruciating overuse of slow-mo (which of course made the film that much longer and my suffering that much more).I could go into a deep and thorough shredding of the plot.. but why waste my time and yours anymore. This is one B grade Hong Kong Kung Fu action flick, without the Kung Fu.  I was very disappointed.

I couldn't believe it was over when Tom (big surprise) offed the bad guy. I was still waiting to see something - anything - I hadn't already seen.  Every single action shot - every motorcycle trick, every explosion, every slow-motion kick, was in the trailer. The problem for the promotion department is that there is nothing else in this movie. It is a void. The story is extremely derivative - every Hollywood cliche dumped into a sausage press and lethargically cranked out. To say that the characters are cardboard would be an exaggeration - cardboard is at least a quarter inch deep. No motivations, no interaction, no good dialog - I think there were two lines that was supposed to be funny. I wasn't expecting Shakespeare but I expected a lot more from John Woo. The were only two - TWO!?! - un exciting,  un original, and very short action sequences separated by interminable exposition. (As opposed to John Woo's Hardboiled of which the final third was one long, wild and amazing shootout that takes place in a hospital full of patients and new born babies. Now that's original!) Hollywood can produce films with good characters and exciting action like Gladiator and make a ton of money so why do they continue to make horrendous trash like MI2?
