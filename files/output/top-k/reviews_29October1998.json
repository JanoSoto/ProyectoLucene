New Mexican farmhouse - a suspected vampire hideout. This first set worked well for me, as pike-and-crossbow-armed members cautiously moved in, opening doors in dusty attics and among large, wooden crate\/wardrobe\/coffin-like objects. Questions came to mind, such as 1) It's an old wooden house. Wouldn't it be safer to just torch the place and thereby drive the vampires out into the sun, burn them, or reduce their cover? and 2) Those vampires snarled, were agile, and used surprise, but seemed little trouble to armed humans. Why didn't the undead use firearms or set booby-traps? No matter the Slayers use an inventive extermination tactic, and the head vampire of this nest (Valek, played by a menacingly well-cast Griffith) makes up for the poor match-up as he evades the hunters, tracks them down to their rented motel, and returns the visit.Team leader Jack Crow (Woods) and the few other survivors retreat to meet the supervising cardinal, where they conclude that Valek seems to be searching for an object or person. A new priest, Father Adam (Guinee), is assigned to the group, and Jack sets out to try to stop Valek, ignoring orders to re-build his team.I enjoyed the humans-eradicating-vampire-nest (and vice-versa) scenes of the first act, but the movie declined from there. Griffith does a great job as Valek, Guinee was fine as Father Adam, and I was pleasantly surprised by Lee's performance as afflicted prostitute Catrina, but the only good dialogues to be spoken are explanations of Valek and other vampires.For the most part, the film did not scare me (notable exception a tentative tiptoe into a dark building by combat-unready Father Adam) - this is mainly an action film. There are loads of violence and foul language, and while that's appropriate for the life-and-undeath vampire-vs.-human struggles, I found it disturbing in a human-abusing-human context. It made it almost impossible to feel sympathy towards Jack or driver Montoya (Baldwin, who reminded me of an overweight Elvis). The only character I could root for was Father Adam, a devout priest thrusted into having to put up with these ruffians. Although it must be said, other students in the audience seemed to like these rough intra-species words and actions more than I did. (Our favorite line was a snide remark about our state.)There is plenty of gore, but it's at a fitting level - a bit nauseating but not overwhelming. Vampire demises are good, human deaths are quick and dirty, and there is one deliciously gross and effective bisection. The Southwestern settings were adequate-to-very-good.Rating for John Q.

Despite this troubled pre-production period On the Waterfront went on to become one of the greatest and most critically aclaimed films ever made.

Again the most lasting impression of On the Waterfront like Streetcar is Brando's performance. The film itself is about a longshoreman and ex-prize fighter who confronts the corrupt labour leaders who effectively run the dockers  lives, in an attempt to expose their criminal practises. The film was hard hitting and controvesial in the subjects it dealt with such as racketeering and socialism and was wrongly accused of promoting communism and being anti American by unionists at the time. The film was shot in New Jersey and in black and white giving the film an authentic oppressed look and adding to the intensity of its subject. In the end the film was a huge hit with audiences and won eight acadamy awards. If you have never seen this film I would highly recommend thet you do so.
