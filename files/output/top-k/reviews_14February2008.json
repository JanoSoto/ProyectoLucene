The main character is a murder and doesn't deserve any tear.But is it really true?Yeah, he is a killer and no one knows how many lives had he cut but he is also a prey.Everyone deserves to get one more chance.No matter how many bad things have we done.John Woo showed us a special atmosphere which lets us decide ourselves how to treat Geoffrey Chow. He is cruel,but as Chow Yun-Fat told us in his interview 'It is only his job, not a personality'.He couldn't see his real nature, his kind-heart just because everything he faced with every single day was violence and blood.He had no friends because one friend followed him-the gun.Tragic accident has changed his life.He got both true friend and true love.Geoffrey was a victim of some facts we don't know about (like how he started killer's job) and the victim of the bandits in the end.After everything he had done for Jenny..can we blame him?I think no.He gave his life for love, for something much more higher than just killing people as he used to.

Those not worth seeing, those worth seeing again and again, and those worth a single viewing. In other words, some movies are a single bag of popcorn experience. Waiting for Guffman comes under the latter category. Seeing it more than once may diminish it as it doesn't really have much more to say than what the typical movie-goer will pretty much absorb in less than 90 minutes. There are some underlying themes but they are applied with a sledge-hammer. Simultaneously, this is a movie more for people in the entertainment industry, particularly in the Broadway scene, as there are a few in-jokes. Some friends of mine who have worked in live theater swear by it as one of the funniest movies they have ever seen. Not quite as wacky as Airplane or This is Spinal Tap (which was made by the same people minus Rob Reiner), but Guffman has its moments.Briefly, the film is a mockumentary (a satirical comedy done in documentary form, like Woody Allen's Take the Money and Run) about the ridiculousness of small-town theater, and maybe the ridiculousness of small-town Midwest American culture. In short, how Midwest small-town America has about as much culture as the outhouses that line the city blocks during a parade down Main Street. Or at least that's how the filmmakers view the community of Blaine, as a nondescript backward American mistake in Missouri that probably doesn't even show up on the map. Of course the rhetorical viewpoint is a gross stereotype in and of itself. Even the raunchiest of wild west towns occasionally performed Shakespeare. But to get the laughs, the filmmakers portray Blaine as the kind of town that probably thinks Gomer Pyle USMC is high art.The thrust of the story, if you can call it a story, is Blaine's attempt to produce a musical based on the history of their town. The details of which could probably be jotted down on a piece of notebook paper and you'd still have more than a page and a half left to fill in a grocery shopping list. The mayor and council members have hired a gay wanna-be Broadway actor\/writer\/director, Corky St. Clair (Christopher Guest, who also directs the film), to write and oversee the musical. Everything is over of the top, which is of course the point. Simultaneously, Guest as the gay musical director was a little much, even for a film that is supposed to be purely for laughs. His gay personality is incredibly stereotypical, and in many scenes he acts exactly as you would expect him, getting unmanageably hysterical over minute details, or emotional when things don't work his way. Maybe I wanted something a little more to him than just the typical gay director who always has his hands on his hips. The other characters, chiefly the actors and actresses who get the parts for the musical, of course believe they are all unknown stars waiting to happen, destined for stardom, but just never had the chance before. And at one point, the cast is promised that Mr Guffman, a talent scout and agent from New York, will travel to Blaine to see their musical and help launch everybody's careers. Hence the title.Then there is the play itself, the musical about Blaine. Unfortunately, it is not just Bad (capital B) but it is not so bad it's good, of the Plan 9 From Outer Space variety. It is just plain bad. Or idiotic is the better word. It's a romp through Blaine's history, which actually makes Romper Room look like Gone With the Wind. The story is narrated directly to the audience by an old coot at a campfire. Just before curtain, we learn that one of the young male actors won't be appearing and Corky will take his place. This was for me the lowest moment of the film. Corky as the replacement makes no attempt to become the character he is playing, but instead just lets his gay personality shine through, particularly during a duet with a young woman where he is supposed to be a young heterosexual soldier about to go to World War I. I felt the scene bordered offensiveness, as a true Broadway actor worth his salt would, whether gay or not, attempt to act in character that was relatively consistent with the script. I think it would have been far funnier if he tried desperately to be more masculine a la Cage aux Folles with tragic results.Given these shortcomings, Guffman has its moments. Maybe too many of them. The auditions sequence is almost unbearable, obviously poking fun at the idea that terrible talent always thinks they are much better than they are. A sort of American Idol meets The Gong Show. Some of the best moments are interviews with the locals who trace their history back to the original foundation of Blaine, in which 19th-century pioneers supposedly thought they had reached the west coast and didn't realize they were 2000 miles off before deciding to create their town. Which is of course the idea behind the creation of the Blaine musical and being more than somewhat ill-conceived. Larry Miller as the town mayor is priceless, almost perfect casting. I would have liked a little more screen time for Bob Balaban as the music teacher who conducts the lifeless orchestra. Check out the trumpet player if you get a chance! You have to credit writer\/actor\/director Guest for at least the most improbable and highly original idea for comedic satire. Maybe it would have actually been funnier and more insightful if Guest had found a town in heartland America and uncovered what made them tick instead of lapsing into such exaggerated stereotypes.

That is why I don't have a choice but to give it 10\/10.I have seen this movie countless times (the original one), I have had Eleanor Coppola's Hearts of Darkness A Filmmaker's Apocalypse on VCR and seen that one more times than I can remember and I have read several reviews of the movie from Magazines etc.According to the legend it is based on Joseph Conrad's Hearts of Darkness and several directors (Orson Welles for instance) have tried to put that book into a usable film-script but failed.So Francis Coppola tried, and told it as a story of a Captain Willard who, during the Vietnam war, gets the assignment to go up a river (into Cambodia (that's classified)) to find Colonel Kurtz whose methods are unsound and to exterminate him with extreme prejudice.The opening scene is simply outstanding. We see Willard in a hotel room haunted by his demons, bursting into tears and smashing the mirror with his bare hands. The score is the Doors the End &#150; a superb choice. If you see Eleanor Coppola's movie you will realize that Martin Sheen is actually on the brink of a mental breakdown and that Coppola exploits it. The crew is afraid that he will actually attack Coppola but nonetheless Coppola keeps directing him, bringing out emotions of sorrow in him. So what you see in this opening scene is not so much acting as it is a man who is actually on the verge of a mental breakdown.Willard gets on a boat with a small group of soldiers and as they go up that river we slowly learn about Colonel Kurtz through the dossiers that Willard brings along as well as getting acquainted with the madness of war.What we learn about Kurtz is, that he has had an outstanding military career but that at a certain point he starts to use methods that cannot be tolerated by his superiors.After a long and dangerous journey we finally reach Kurtz's hide-out and are greeted by a very nervous guy (Dennis Hopper) with pseudo-philosophical thoughts and a local tribe. From him we learn the Kurtz is clear in his mind but sick in his soul and that he expects something from Willard &#150; understanding? Later Kurtz returns and takes Willard as a prisoner and talks with him about war in some dialogs that sends shivers down your spine. Kurtz tells Willard about his war experiences and of one in particular that made him realize what it takes to win a war. What he tells is that he earlier in the Vietnam war went into a village where he together with other US soldiers inoculated the children of that village. After they leave the village they are suddenly called back and upon returning they see that the north Vietnamese have been there and hacked off every little inoculated arm. And as if shot by a diamond bullet in his forehead Kurtz realizes that an act like this is what is needed to win the war. He goes on and claims that a soldier that can do an act like this is not a monster but just has an extraordinary amount of will; the will to win the war.After having this revelation colonel Kurtz applies the same sort of methods himself and although they are very effective they cannot be tolerated by his superiors and this is why Willard gets the assignment to terminate him. Kurtz's way of viewing how a war should be fought poses some very interesting questions that are difficult to answer in a simple way. As I see it Kurtz's point is, that once you have decided to go to war it really doesn't make sense not to use any method available to win it. There can only be total war if you really want to win. The act of hacking off the arms of the children has been done in the attempt to win the war and should not to be seen as an act motivated by mere hatred. If you concern yourself with the civilians and human rights then you are a nothing but a hypocrite. Kurtz then becomes a very efficient soldier but his new war-philosophy makes it impossible for him to stay human (or makes him sick in his soul as stated by Hopper).It has been stated that the ending is a flop. Coppola himself struggled hard to find a suitable ending and I am not sure that he was altogether satisfied with this one. To me I always understood it this way Kurtz wants Willard to kill him as he has probably seen and imposed horrors beyond our wildest imaginations which makes it nearly impossible for him to carry on. When he at last is brought down by Willard the only thing that comes to his mind is the horror, the horror. He is truly sick in his soul.I will recommend this to anyone as I think it tries to give us some account on what war can bring out in the soldiers who are sent away to fight.regards Simon ","genre":null},{"date":"14 February 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie has given me one of the greatest movie experiences in my life.

The act of hacking off the arms of the children has been done in the attempt to win the war and should not to be seen as an act motivated by mere hatred. If you concern yourself with the civilians and human rights then you are a nothing but a hypocrite. Kurtz then becomes a very efficient soldier but his new war-philosophy makes it impossible for him to stay human (or makes him sick in his soul as stated by Hopper).It has been stated that the ending is a flop. Coppola himself struggled hard to find a suitable ending and I am not sure that he was altogether satisfied with this one. To me I always understood it this way Kurtz wants Willard to kill him as he has probably seen and imposed horrors beyond our wildest imaginations which makes it nearly impossible for him to carry on. When he at last is brought down by Willard the only thing that comes to his mind is the horror, the horror. He is truly sick in his soul.I will recommend this to anyone as I think it tries to give us some account on what war can bring out in the soldiers who are sent away to fight.regards Simon ","genre":"Drama, War"},{"date":"14 February 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie has given me one of the greatest movie experiences in my life. That is why I don't have a choice but to give it 10\/10.I have seen this movie countless times (the original one), I have had Eleanor Coppola's Hearts of Darkness A Filmmaker's Apocalypse on VCR and seen that one more times than I can remember and I have read several reviews of the movie from Magazines etc.According to the legend it is based on Joseph Conrad's Hearts of Darkness and several directors (Orson Welles for instance) have tried to put that book into a usable film-script but failed.So Francis Coppola tried, and told it as a story of a Captain Willard who, during the Vietnam war, gets the assignment to go up a river (into Cambodia (that's classified)) to find Colonel Kurtz whose methods are unsound and to exterminate him with extreme prejudice.The opening scene is simply outstanding. We see Willard in a hotel room haunted by his demons, bursting into tears and smashing the mirror with his bare hands. The score is the Doors the End &#150; a superb choice. If you see Eleanor Coppola's movie you will realize that Martin Sheen is actually on the brink of a mental breakdown and that Coppola exploits it. The crew is afraid that he will actually attack Coppola but nonetheless Coppola keeps directing him, bringing out emotions of sorrow in him. So what you see in this opening scene is not so much acting as it is a man who is actually on the verge of a mental breakdown.Willard gets on a boat with a small group of soldiers and as they go up that river we slowly learn about Colonel Kurtz through the dossiers that Willard brings along as well as getting acquainted with the madness of war.What we learn about Kurtz is, that he has had an outstanding military career but that at a certain point he starts to use methods that cannot be tolerated by his superiors.After a long and dangerous journey we finally reach Kurtz's hide-out and are greeted by a very nervous guy (Dennis Hopper) with pseudo-philosophical thoughts and a local tribe. From him we learn the Kurtz is clear in his mind but sick in his soul and that he expects something from Willard &#150; understanding? Later Kurtz returns and takes Willard as a prisoner and talks with him about war in some dialogs that sends shivers down your spine. Kurtz tells Willard about his war experiences and of one in particular that made him realize what it takes to win a war. What he tells is that he earlier in the Vietnam war went into a village where he together with other US soldiers inoculated the children of that village. After they leave the village they are suddenly called back and upon returning they see that the north Vietnamese have been there and hacked off every little inoculated arm. And as if shot by a diamond bullet in his forehead Kurtz realizes that an act like this is what is needed to win the war. He goes on and claims that a soldier that can do an act like this is not a monster but just has an extraordinary amount of will; the will to win the war.After having this revelation colonel Kurtz applies the same sort of methods himself and although they are very effective they cannot be tolerated by his superiors and this is why Willard gets the assignment to terminate him. Kurtz's way of viewing how a war should be fought poses some very interesting questions that are difficult to answer in a simple way. As I see it Kurtz's point is, that once you have decided to go to war it really doesn't make sense not to use any method available to win it. There can only be total war if you really want to win. The act of hacking off the arms of the children has been done in the attempt to win the war and should not to be seen as an act motivated by mere hatred.

However, it's been over a decade since then, and right now, I tend to like a lot of crude humour, so I'm slowly exploring the works of Smith, a filmmaker well-known for that type of thing. After watching his first two films, Clerks and Mallrats, I have gotten around to watching this third effort of his, and it was a slightly different experience, but still a good one overall.Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards are two great friends who work together as comic book artists. While at a comic book convention one day, they meet another artist named Alyssa Jones, introduced to them by Hooper LaMont, who is also in the comic book business. Holden quickly develops a crush on Alyssa, but soon learns that she is a lesbian. Much trouble ensues, as Holden and Alyssa become great friends, but Holden wants to be more than that, which doesn't seem likely to ever happen. Many struggles lie ahead for the young comic book artist in his romantic life, as he has a lot to learn, and his new crush also threatens his long-term friendship with Banky! Since this movie is from Kevin Smith, you can obviously expect lots of extremely vulgar jokes and profanity. Like Smith's first two films, some scenes in this one made me laugh pretty hard. However, unlike its two predecessors, this one also made me think. A while into the film, it seems to turn from a comedy into more of a drama, which certainly cannot be said about Clerks and Mallrats. Although I wasn't expecting that, I'm not complaining, as the drama kept me watching, and may have even put a lump in my throat for a while. On the other hand, the film also left me a bit confused as to what it was implying, and I know there's been controversy over this, which doesn't surprise me in the least. Many seem to think this movie is intelligent, while some others think it's naive and ignorant (I see lots of conflicting reviews here), and it seemed sort of like a bit of both to me, but what do I know? I guess I'm just not experienced enough to take a strong stance on this issue. Nonetheless, I have to give Chasing Amy credit for all the entertainment value I found in it.Anyone who can't stand constant swearing and crude talk about sex should obviously avoid this film like the plague. Like I said, you can expect that from Kevin Smith's films. It certainly shouldn't surprise anyone who knows his style. If you usually find Smith funny, then you should probably find some good laughs in this one, but I'm not sure what you would think of the drama. If you just want comedy, I'm sure you would be disappointed, but if Smith's usual crude jokes combined with touching and fairly heavy drama sounds good to you, then you could be very impressed.

Lord of the Rings surpasses it on many levels...but Legeng still has the ability after all these years to make me think of pure fantasy, and that's what I believe this film is about. Good vs evil is what most films are about, but Legend is what fairies and goblins and a mystical forests are! Visually I doubt you can find much better even 20 odd years later! Good vs evil in a setting that is set in a purer forum. Character development here are not too strong, but they're not meant to be. They are strong enough to portray love vs evil vs good and bad, and they do it well in the context of the story. Tom Cruise did a good Job as the Nieve and yet courageous Jack, Lily was a the prize of his longing and it came across as undeniable. Mia Sara as lily is the stuff of youthful longing.Tim Curry played the spoiler and he did it to the point of stealing all of the film. He is the stuff of fantasy. The costume was spectacular, and his portrayal of the character was commanding...And over the top cause that what he does well! I enjoyed the directors cut film more as it is longer and tells the story just a little better, but I enjoyed Tangarines Dream's score more as it captured the mood of fantasy ( for me) as set in a mystical place! Jerry Goldsmith had some very good moments, but TD for me layed out a fairytale with my eyes closed better. But at the end you either see this for the pure fantasy it is about or you see it as something deeper that it doesn't pretend to be. It's much purer in it's view on good vs evil and to my taste it hits on every level of that platform. And not to mention it's ability to make for a great dream filled with hope and danger.Pure fantasy...and should be viewed with that intent.

However, my point is not the film itself, but one particular scene-- the drawing room recital at Lady Dalroy's where Paula (Ingrid Bergman) is finally driven to emotional collapse by her fortune-hunting husband Gregory (Charles Boyer). Not only is the scene beautifully performed, but it also amounts to one of the purest examples of civilized mayhem in Hollywood annals. Gregory seeks to destroy Paula, not physically, but mentally, and in this scene almost succeeds. The sequence also exemplifies vintage Hollywood at its collaborative peak, and is thus worth a deeper look. The sequence begins with Paula confronting Gregory at home in a last stab at independence from his suffocating control. She insists that she must go to Lady Dalroy's recital. She looks ravishing in her party gown, but beneath the firmly-set jaw lurks the anxious knowledge that the demanding Gregory will refuse to accompany her. After all, his plan has been to keep her isolated so as to prey on her mind. He refuses to go, of course, expecting this to be final since she has been under his spell for weeks. But now Paula is determined, her jaw set more firmly as she stalks off-- she will go without him. Watch Boyer do some quick mental calibration, realizing that Paula is escaping his grasp. Shifting gears he relents, dressing hurriedly, and in the process appearing (it's not clear) to take out the fateful watch-- already he's scheming how to exploit the new situation.They arrive late to Lady Dalroy's in such a way that all the lavishly dressed lords and ladies note their presence. But that's okay because Paula looks radiant, having momentarily escaped confinement at home. The pianist enters, seats himself, and immediately launches into a darkly portentous selection, and right away we know its Paula who's being musically menaced. The camera dollies in on the twosome, she rapturous in her liberation, he plotting his next move. And here begins one of the most exquisitely executed breakdowns in film annals. Gregory reaches for his watch bob, presumably to check the time, and of course pulls out only a dangling chain just as he planned. Matter of factly, he leans over to inform Paula of the missing timepiece. Watch the next sequence of fleeting expressions as Paula tries to stifle the mounting panic that she has truly lost her mind, that she has taken her husband's timepiece and cannot now recall the event. She stifles a small outburst, getting the unwanted attention of those around her. He reaches to take her little purse, while she sits, hoping against hope. But there it is, just where the scheming Gregory has put it. Suddenly alone in the crowd, she's plunged back into her tormented little world. She struggles to control the panic, but the emotional waves are too strong. Finally engulfed, Paula collapses in unrestrained sobs. Humiliated in front of the lords and ladies, she must lean on Gregory to get out the door and back to confinement. Gregory has won by turning her last stab at independence into humiliating defeat. She is again under his malign control.I've gone into detail for two reasons. First, Bergman manages the emotional sequence in such expert fashion, carrying out the descending scale from rapture to collapse like an intricate piano piece. This scene alone is worth the Oscar. It's certainly not the movie's climax, but does remain the dramatic high-point and an exquisite example of civilized mayhem among the terribly refined and unfailingly polite. And second, what a crystal clear example of old Hollywood at its collaborative best. Note how well-mounted are the lords and ladies in their finery that makes Paula's humiliation even more deeply felt, while the economy of director Cukor's camera keeps eyes glued to the screen, and the astute script that knows when silences speak more loudly than words. All of these come together to heighten Bergman's virtuosic performance, transforming the scene into a minor masterpiece and a triumph for MGM's production unit. In our era of exploding cars, digitalized worlds, and acrobatic derring-do, a scene like this may seem impossibly tame and old-fashioned. But we all continue to have inner lives of one sort or another. And it's that hidden terrain on which Gregory has chosen to launch his assault.

There is obviously a lot of talent and ideas in them, but I can't help but wonder why so few of his movies are good as a whole work. This is a great example.The premise of a director going suddenly blind from psychological stresses just as he is about to make his biggest picture is full of possibilities, but too many of the scenes are built around arguments by small-minded people instead of developing humorous or visual situations of any length. We are told that the direction and the dailies of the film being created are chaotic and make no sense, but we are never shown any examples. Instead, we are merely told that the shooting of the movie proceeds week after week with everyone believing a viable movie is being made, even though the cameraman is being driven mad by the poor direction. Well, which is it? We don't get a taste of either the absurdity or the viability of the process to buy into the idea or laugh about it.Instead, a lot of time is spent with woody Allen's character refuting one gorgeous live-in partner to reminisce and argue with a beautiful ex-wife while rejecting the advances of the movie's young buxom starlet. In other words, Allen's alter-ego is on display yet again with women averaging about half his age. All the while Allen's extremely nervous gesturing and pleading for help as he gropes around blindly makes him look not only very old, but also dim-witted, and certainly not attractive enough to garner this attention from women. What could be funny is played up to such an annoying extent that I lost sympathy and patience for his situation.That said, there are just enough scenes with humor and good acting (Hack, the director's agent is particularly well cast) that I did chuckle from time to time, the sets, scenes, lighting and the colors are all appealing. It was not in general, a painful experience, just not a very funny or meaningful one either.

For some reason it was fairly easy on Dogma references, the only reference to it I can think of being '...passed down by god herself...' I thought this film would be mostly terrible, but it wasn't at all, the self-loving brings it down, but Jay And Silent Bob are great as usual, the plot is throwaway, and could be replaced with anything to just make Jay and Bob run around, but not too many complaints about it. Any references to previous View Askew films later on in the film, were scattered around well enough to not make them cringe-worthy, although it's too heavy on them right at the end. One thing I really disliked about the film, although I forgive it is Jason Mewes' fart near the beginning of the movie, that was the most cringe-worthy thing to do with Kevin Smith ever, and not because of the vulgarity, like I'd cringe at 'it was like sticking my dick in battery acid', because of the sheer thoughtlessness of it, I can forgive it though as in the commentary Kevin Smith admitted to it being his least favourite shot in anything he's ever done, although he did also say he was proud of the fart joke with Ali Larter, which was something I definitely could've done without in the film. Smith took a risk by returning to his low-brow roots of Mallrats (and taking it further), after doing the more thoughtful (for his standards) Dogma and Chasing Amy, he also took a risk by putting Will Ferrel in a semi-major role in the film, many Smith fans may dislike his inclusion, but me personally, I enjoyed his performance a lot, despite not really being a fan. Could've been an 8\/10 without all the self indulgent rubbish. Smith denies sitting at home thinking 'I am a f**king comic genius' on his DVD An Evening With Kevin Smith 2, but I'm not so sure.

Imagine a teenager, named John, the typical guy who goes to the last year of high school and doesn't quite know what to do with his life. Then, one day, he finds a beautiful woman lying on the floor in a field who, apparently, is on the run for something she did and takes her to his room. It's a boarding school, he might get kicked out, but he doesn't care; he just wants to help her. The look on his face when the woman first wakes up and the teenager walks towards her, is the first sign of a magical performance by Lukas Hass; it's a look that combines the excitement of having this woman in his bed and the curiosity of wanting to know what she might have done.The woman is called Patty Vare, played by the wonderful Winona Ryder in the kind of role she knows by heart but never forgets to add new elements to. Here, besides appearing to be somewhere other than the real world (she fell off a horse before John found her and doesn't remember much), she masters the 'look'; that seductive look only she can achieve and makes anyone go crazy to the point that they would do anything for her. Well, at least that's the effect it had on John in the movie&#133;And on me, of course.But don't get things wrong. I personally don't think Boys is a romantic movie, even if it was writer\/director Stacy Cochran's intention. I would call it some kind of an 'age analysis'. Yes, there are romance related moments that make you smile because Winona is an expert on the subject, but this time her character Patty is an expert too on men. So the study the film tries to make is what can happen when a woman of Patty's experience meets a kid like John in an extreme situation.That's why Cochran shows us flashbacks of what happened to Patty before meeting John; they're necessary for us to know the kind of woman she is. On the other hand, we don't know anything about John but the fact that he has a bad relationship with his father (a respectable Chris Cooper). But we don't need to know, because we realize when he is with Patty; when we hear what he says and see what he does.There's a scene in the town fair, where Patty and John are together in the merry-go-round. The final moment of that scene explains why I liked this movie, and those are the scenes in the movie that work. Not the police sub-plot (led by a convincing John C. Reilly), not John's relationship with his friends at school (although some scenes are good to watch more of Hass' perfect work), not even the conflict with his father.There's another scene really worth paying attention too a chat in a table where a beautiful light from the window makes Patty seem so vulnerable. Luckily for us, this is a movie where we have the final world; about whether we believe the characters or not and about the inconclusive and far-fetched ending.

The music supplied by Jerry Goldsmith I find to be stunningly beautiful, and the the adventure script by David Koepp based on the Walter B. Gibson character so strongly made that every scene becomes memorable. Then there is a most- stylish production design by Joseph C. Nemecs III, strong cinematography by Stephen H. Burum, award caliber Art Direction by Jack Johnson, Dan Olkiewicz, and Steven Wolff, epic set decoration by Garrett Lewis and colorful and very apposite costume design by Bob Ringwood. Willi Bar, Martin Bregman and Patricia Churchill produced this obviously masterful work of cinematic adventure with Rolf Deyhle, Louis A. Stroller, and Stan Weston. And one needs to mention the special effects, visual effects, low-key lighting and their general handling...for once exactly attuned, I suggest, to the strong if fantastic-for-the-sake-of-idea storyline of the film. The plot narrative I argue is so strong that this is what makes everything work. An almost Shakespearean sense of abstracted good and evil, beginning with the central character's evolution and presentation in a prologue, throws a chiaroscuro handling of bright lights and dark shadows onto every character and every line action and visual element. The fact that Lamont Cranston, later the Shadow, has both potential evil and great good in him is turned by the mystical Master Tulu into an opportunity to convert him from being the most ruthless of warlords to a man who will use his newly-mastered power to cloud men's minds so they cannot see him into a power used to combat men who would misemploy such forces. But all too soon, just as he meets a dangerously psychic and disturbingly beautiful woman, Cranston is confronted by his ultimate adversary Shiwan Khan, descendant of the Jenghiz Khan, who sets out to dominate the world, thereby involving the girl--Margot Lane's--her scientist father, his weakling assistant, Cranston's Uncle, the city's police chief, and the network of informants and aides Cranston has built during his career of saving men's lives and enlisting them thereafter. A silent and sometimes violent battle that then rages through the city of New York in the 1930s--presented here as a majestic visual setting apt to such a contest--moves toward a dangerous and inevitable final contest with swift visual presentations, spare but highly-intelligent dialog and a well-sustained mood of impending crisis, a crisis I claim is well resolved. AsThe Shadow, Alec Baldwin defeats badmen and enjoys himself thoroughly doing the task. He deserved a nomination I assert for carrying off a role of so much complexity with elegance, subtle humor and professionalism. John Lone as his adversary is above average in a difficult role. Penelope Ann Miller is lovely and convincing as Margot Lane. Other notables in the very large cast include Macolm McDowell in the brief part of Professor Lane, Tim Curry as his Uriah Heep-like assistant, Jonathan Winters as the stodgy Uncle, Peter Boyle and Sab Shimono, as the Shadow's confederates, Brady Tsurutani as Tulku and James Hong as a victim of the formerly evil Cranston seen in the prologue. The movie is perhaps among the most intelligent and consistent productions I have knowledge of this side of the equally logical and similarly underrated American President, Elf, and The Mark of Zorro.

I guess he just got lucky with that one. Nevertheless, bringing him back to rescue the series from the clutches of the Shatnermonster was clearly a good decision. Everyone seems to have been so relieved that they are willing to ignore this movie's many and massive flaws.The core problem here is that the smug self-righteousness which was always the most obnoxious thing about *Star Trek* serves as the very basis of the film, and is handled in an even more ham-handed manner than it usually is. (Funny how no one ever behaves like a racist jerk until a Point needs to be made, and then suddenly Starfleet's full of 'em!) But that is exacerbated by a constant stream of little idiocies and absurdities Chekov asks if he should raise shields when the *Enterprise* meets the ship they were expecting to meet. So, complete idiots can become officers on the Federation flagship, then? The idea of Klingons and humans dining together is treated as a shocking and unprecedented thing, even though the end of the previous movie, they were shown partying together (though it is understandable why everyone wanted to forget that the execrable *ST5* existed).Spock just happens to have a sticky-backed homing device which he can place on Kirk's shirt when he needs one, even though there is no reason at the time for him to be carrying one around.This marvel of 23rd-century miniaturization is an inch long and half an inch wide and remains clearly visible on the shoulder of Kirk's uniform throughout the entire process of his arrest and trial, but the Klingons never notice it.Neither the *Enterprise*'s crew, nor even the computer, can easily tell from the trajectory of a torpedo whether it came from *Enterprise*'s launchers or a point under her keel? And the neutron surge which could only have come from another ship didn't alert anyone to the presence of another ship until after Kirk and McCoy had been sentenced? I think I see how Chekov kept getting promoted.Apparently, gravity boots are not standard equipment on Starfleet vessels with artificial gravity, since only the killers will have them. Gee, you'd think having a few pairs around would be kind of useful, just in case.Valeris demonstrates the *Enterprise*'s alarm system by actually firing a phaser at a pot of food in the galley, instead of just explaining it.The guy she's explaining it to is Chekov.
