It has a good story and good acting. Though I don 't think that the movie is good enough to be at the top of the 250 list at IMDb. I think that it is a great prison movie but it's so similar to other books and movies like Midnight Express or The Escape From Alcatraz. A prison movie that is much better but doesn't get the glory and credibility is The Green Mile witch made me more emotional and excited. Compared with The Shawshank Redemption, The Green mile has a better storyline and most important an original prison story.The Shawshank Redemption is about man called Andy who is being wrongly accused for a crime that he didn't do. He was given two life sentences for killing his wife and her lover in cold blood. Therefore he is being sent to Shawshank Prison. Andy learns to adapt to prison life and he meets knew friends, but also enemies. The life in prison is hard and he meets a lot of obstacles as the story goes.As I said earlier, it is a good movie and you should see it if you haven't. However in my opinion it is too unoriginal and safe for the best film in history as many other think. By saying safe I mean that the director could have done something that had made me remember the film. Something out of the ordinary. Instead of the escape prison unoriginality. Cause now I think it's just a bland movie.Another thing that I think the movie misses is more fighting and crime. Isn't this a prison? Should it not have any sort of violent behavior? Sure Andy fights of a bunch of enemies in a few short scenes, but I don't think that that's enough. The thing is that Andy's enemies are the only bad guys in the whole movie. At least of what we see in this film. The film could have exploited more violence and crime, but instead we get a nice old man that feeds his bird. Andy's friends are so nice that I sometimes feel like they are workmates instead of committed criminals. When they are out in the yard all convicts are just playing ball and talking like they are having a lunch brake. I don't mean that all prisoners should just fight and swear but it could have least been one fight seen in the yard so you get a bit more of that prison feeling.In conclusion it's a good movie with some flaws. It's has many good scenes. Though in my opinion it fails because of its blandness and unoriginality. They should have put more effort in making something more memorable.Based on my judgment it's a 8\/10 and I think that it's a fare rating. It should have its title in the top 250, but not the number one.\/\/Swedish Critic ","genre":null},{"date":"17 December 2013","score":"","review":" The Shawshank Redemption is a good movie.

One of those is 1990's Home Alone. Written and produced by the late, great John Hughes and directed by Chris Columbus, it follows the story of young Kevin McCallister (Played by Macaulay Culkin, arguably the best child actor since Shirley Temple) who's constantly picked on and looked down upon by his large, extended family but especially by his older and much hated brother, Buzz (Devin Ratray in what has to be his best role). On the eve of the big family vacation, Kevin lashes out and gets sent to the attic by his impatient mom (The talented and ravishing Catherine O'Hara) and right then Kevin makes the prophetic wish of never seeing his family again. Little does he know, his wish is about to come true when due to a convenient power outage, his parents' alarm clocks fails to go off and the result is sheer holiday hell as everybody scrambles like there's no tomorrow to catch that flight. Everybody that is, except little Kevin who's forgotten by everyone and as the title says, is left home alone. Shock turns to happiness as Kevin realizes his wish has come true.But it's not all fun and games as two naughty burglars Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who give a wonderful performance together as the two bumbling thieves) are on the rampage in Kevin's neighborhood. Rather than running away like most kids might do, Kevin decides to fight back using his creativity and some simple but potentially bone shattering traps. It all might sound like a simple holiday comedy to be watched and then put away, but there's something more to the film that keeps me and many others coming back year after year. To be sure, the physical comedy of Harry and Marv getting their asses handed to them by Kevin's traps is nothing short of a laugh riot (Traps include anything from heated door handles to slippery steps).But the film also manages to include a lot of heart as Kevin slowly but surely begins to realize that family is what the holidays are all about and without them it's pretty lonely, a lesson he learns first hand by the at first feared but then loved neighborhood recluse, Old Man Marley (the late, great character actor Robert Blossom). John Williams score to this is undoubtedly one of his best as it is both grand and yet not overbearing in the least. On the contrary, it manages to invoke the spirit of Christmas in all of us while giving us the chills because of its beauty. And of course, who can forget the performance of Macaulay Culkin since the film rests on his shoulders more than anything else. With his mischievous grin and resourcefulness, we just can't help but love his character and root for him all the way through the film. I should also mention that the movie includes a small but very memorable performance by the legendary John Candy (Try not to laugh at the conversation he has with Kevin's mom in the back of the van!). Home Alone is one of those films that no matter how many times you might see it, it just never gets old. The movie is a time capsule in many ways because it somehow captured not only the holiday spirit but also the magic of the time it was made in, the 90's, a time where not only were the movies better but so was everything else. It is for that reason that movie will live on forever and ever, much like the spirit of Christmas itself. So without further adieu, I urge you to watch this modern classic and if you're ever going on big trip with the family, make sure that you have all your children! Also starring John Heard and a host of other memorable actors. Merry Christmas everyone!!!!!!!

Its reliance upon special effects and scenery reminds me of the first Star Trek movie, which had similar weaknesses.For me to enjoy a movie, it is important that I care about the characters. Ironically, the only one I cared about even a little was the replicant, Rachael. Until she meets Deckard, she is unaware that she is a replicant, and this knowledge is a blow to her. The desire for a manufactured being to be a real human is reasonably well portrayed, but better examples are Pinocchio,and Commander Data of Star Trek TNG. What is unclear to me is why Rachael would bother saving Decards life - he has no personality or redeeming features. I also find a couple of aspects of the ending unbelievable. It is illogical and out of character for Roy Batty to prolong the fight with Deckard, especially when Deckard starts to inflict serious damage to him.

Clint, who shows up late, helps one in a bit of distress, just by pointing his finger and spouting the word Bang. Clint totally steals this scene, with a Why do I have to be here look, while also using as reference, making it with a shetland pony. He's saddled with a female partner, (Tyne Daly) so we know there's gonna be a but of friction here. A group of pi..ed off terrorists, ex vets, have kidnapped the mayor, their use of transport, an armaguard truck, you see them acquire at the start. These are some real dangerous psychos, too, void of any compunction, like a guided missile. As always in these Harry's we have an early, just for the hell of it action scene, a robber wanting a car, who's quickly disposed of by Harry, leaving this bottle shop in quite a bit of a mess. I still enjoy this film. It just doesn't come off good as the others. Blowing the bad guy away, with a rocket, doesn't help with the quality of the film. Tyne Daly has her moment, with a line she delivers as an omen to a terrorist, You laugh at me bastard, I'll shoot you where you stand. We hope he does move, just to see the result. Eastwood has his moments, like when authorities, foil his investigation, regarding a black snitch he uses, goes out the window. The line he uses, to retort, regarding a six pointed badge is hilarious. You've seen this black dude in other Harry films, in small roles he does. Again Eastwood has his moment at the end, where he walks off into the distance. This is probably the funniest Harry of the five, but as I said the cheap story is really what discredits it.

In fact, I would say it is the best of them. In addition to critical treatises on marriage, gender and sexuality, Hitchcock studies one of his favorite themes of a man who yearns for something different and thus practically invites chaos to his life which otherwise would be in perfect order. This perfect order of harmonious dimensions is portrayed in the opening dolly shot of the protagonist's dull office life. Then, however, we see that he doesn't quite fit this seeming order, revealing distress beneath, as he cannot open up his umbrella with the others. The story begins when he and his wife, bored with their mundane life, hear of an early inheritance which leads them to a trip round the world. Unlike in The 39 Steps (1935) or Saboteur (1942), here the abundance of settings doesn't equal exciting adventure, although quite a fast pace, but a fragmentary episode-like structure and a ground for the theme of alienation. These may be among the reasons why Rich and Strange was back in the day so poorly received, but, nonetheless, has later been commended by several critics (Truffaut, Spoto) as well as favored by the master himself. In the essence of the film's moral (which may be a word too puny for Hitchcock's level of mastery) is that the main couple yearn for excitement and adventure, but instead of enriching, life-enhancing experiences, go through severe disillusionment. This disillusionment, however, doesn't affect their life for better or worse. It remains the same. Donald Spoto has written that it is in these moments of disillusionment where lies the main point of the film the acceptance for the extremes of life and death as they are. In comparison to The Skin Game (1931), which Hitchcock made just before this, Rich and Strange is much more original and cinematic. The same happened with Murder! (1930) which is far more superior than its theatrical predecessor Juno and the Paycock (1929). But what really makes Rich and Strange so special, and a fascinating part of Hitchcock's oeuvre, is its absurdity. This absurdity is not only gained from story nor humor but, above all, from their odd execution. The absurdity emerges from the film's unique, strange atmosphere. This atmosphere must be experienced to be understood and it is eternally guarded by the magical aura of the film given to it by early sound cinema.

Sadly, I wasn't feeling it as much this time and moved it slightly downwards instead of upwards, but it's still quite a remarkable film, and O'Toole is wonderful. For one thing I just didn't find the desert landscapes (which were the highlight last time) as jaw-dropping anymore, however vast and beautiful they still were. I can only hope I won't be desensitized to Barry Lyndon too when I revisit that. The plot as such also enthralled me less, I wouldn't say it's a chore to sit through but the three and a half hours did take their toll.However despite being less riveted this time around it probably resonated more with me thematically than before. It's a very fascinating character study; not entirely a linear rise and fall type of movie but somewhat of a wavelike pattern of mythologization and demythologization, with Lawrence bordering on a deity at times (e.g. You gave life and you took it.

Sadly, I wasn't feeling it as much this time and moved it slightly downwards instead of upwards, but it's still quite a remarkable film, and O'Toole is wonderful. For one thing I just didn't find the desert landscapes (which were the highlight last time) as jaw-dropping anymore, however vast and beautiful they still were. I can only hope I won't be desensitized to Barry Lyndon too when I revisit that. The plot as such also enthralled me less, I wouldn't say it's a chore to sit through but the three and a half hours did take their toll.However despite being less riveted this time around it probably resonated more with me thematically than before. It's a very fascinating character study; not entirely a linear rise and fall type of movie but somewhat of a wavelike pattern of mythologization and demythologization, with Lawrence bordering on a deity at times (e.g. You gave life and you took it.

The Coens usually deliver a substantial amount of both and that's Their Secret Ingredient. That blend of herbs and spices that make Their Films tasty and delicious.This is one bleak and brutal Movie, that is also Funny. You there at Film School, try and pull that one off and if you do Hollywood is waiting, and so is Box Office and Critical acclaim. The Characters here, are not Ivy League Smart, they are homespun, earthy, and are on top of things even when that isn't obvious.The Movie is pristine looking and void of much Color, except maybe Red and it is the Red against White contrast that is the Template of this fine Character Study.

It's a Marvel adaptation of one of the lesser known comic book heroes, Blade, that has thus went on to become a successful movie franchise. One of the original and one of the greater comic book films made, you'd have to go all the way back to 1998 to remember this comic classic, Blade, have we all forgotten about this movie? Blade is fairly awesome! I don't hear about too much worthy praise for Blade but in time Blade will surely be remembered and appreciated for the generally awesome movie that it is.Played bestially by Wesley Snipes, Blade is a legendary vampire hunter who is a half-breed, half-man half-vampire, only one of his kind, making him The Daywalker, giving him all the strengths of the vampire but with none of their weaknesses. In his fight against evil, Blade's equipped with an extensive arsenal of blades and guns and special gadgets to stay alive with, and he's a master of the martial arts with superhuman strength and capabilities. Blade's one man army weapon specialist, Whistler, makes all kinds of useful toys for Blade. Deacon Frost is the street smart, book smart, driven bloodthirsty lead villain vampire obsessed with unleashing the Blood God, La Magra. Blade ends up taking a liking to a human who is about to turn, Karen, unless they can find a cure. N'Bushe Wright appears in one of her best roles. She's incredible as Karen. N'Bushe Wright is physically impressive alongside Wesley Snipes. Kris Kristofferson is really awesome in Blade. Kristofferson gives a really moving performance. It's one of his better roles. Stephen Dorff can be found in one of his top roles. Dorff is believable as Deacon Frost and very good.Blade's razor-sharp from end to end, nicely pieced together with spectacular fight scenes, bass-pounding techno, excellent storyboard, intense action and star-powered acting from Wesley Snipes, Wright, Kristofferson, and Dorff. If you're a fan of this type of a movie and you haven't seen it yet, GO WATCH IT, and HURRY! Blades's a really cool flick!
