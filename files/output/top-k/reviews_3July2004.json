I only had some interest in it after reading some reviews here that claimed the movie wasn't as bad as some made it out to be, or that it didn't live up to the original, but held up on its own as a different take on the story.  Well, rather than flesh out the strange details of the first movie, TTCM2 rewrites nearly everything, and the details that are brought back are simply repeated ad-nauseum.  Rather than an interesting, more detailed view of Leatherface's family, I found characters who were repetetive, annoying, and even boring at times.  The best part of this movie is the opening text, which treats itself seriously.  Then, immediately, we're warped into 1986, complete with goofy acting and ridiculous clothes.  The characters don't act, they just yell their lines at the top of their lungs.  And the incoherent Leatherface appearance at the beginning should have been enough warning that the entire movie would be this unwatchable.The movie isn't scary, but it does go out of its way to make you feel uncomfortable.  House of 1000 corpses is a far, far tamer movie, and is actually an enjoyable camp-fest compared to this drivel.  I thought the character chop-top would have some redeeming value, as one of his lines is sampled in a Primus song, and the actor that plays him seemed fairly proud of himself for playing the character in the House of 1000 corpses DVD interviews.  Instead, I find a character trying desperately to be funny and psychotic, and coming across as nothing more than stupid acting.  If you've seen Dumb and Dumberer or other comedies that try too damn hard to be funny, so hard that no sublety or believability is left, then you have every last character in this movie.The acting is intolerably dumb.  Every last scene is a gruelling test of endurance.  I don't care what drugs you're using, they won't get you through this film.  Your ears will bleed from hearing everyone shout their lines badly into the camera.  I can understand sub-par sequels.  i can tolerate bad movies.  But this is far worse than bad.  This is god awful.  It looks like it was directed by retarded sixth graders.  This does no justice to either the classic movie or the remake.  Why I listened to reviews on this site claiming it was at least tolerable, or simply misunderstood, I'll never know.  This movie is not enjoyable, and has no redeeming quality.  It adds nothing.  Not only is the acting bad, it's tainted with 80's style.  It does not age well.  There is no immersiveness here, only a film that tries too hard to be funny, scary, dramatic, action packed, and interesting, and fails on all counts.I would rather open the movie case and find it filled with vomit than watch this.

Also like Stpehen King, the results of adapting Heinlein's work into the format of film rarely live up to the potential set by the material. The major difference between the two authors is that an adaptation of Heinlein usually gets better the further it strays from the source, so long as it sticks to the spirit. Ironically, the Verhoeven\/Neumeier adaptation of StarShip Troopers remains the best that Hollywood has come up with so far.The problem with The Puppet Masters as a film is that after a well-constructed setup in which the aliens are made entirely plausible, even somehow real, it descends rapidly into yet another action\/sci-fi hybrid in the vein of Predator or Aliens. This in itself wouldn't be so bad, except for two things. One, Heinlein's stories were always intended as the exact opposite kind of science-fiction. Two, the mixture of the two elements leaves the film unbalanced. The second half feels very disjoined from the first.The scientific concepts shown in the film are not perfect, but they give it an atmosphere that many horror films of the era lack. However, the science of the film is not the only key to making a great story. Where it falls down is in the Transition. The Transition from one moment to the next leaves gaps of logic that disconnects the audience from the story. The questions of how on Earth one thing got here or there are never adequately answered. Telling us that something escaped never works as well as showing us, and unfortunately, this production of The Puppet Masters never does enough of the latter.The acting doesn't help matters a lot. Donald Sutherland is very competent as usual, but the script gives him little to distinguish his character from the other several dozen that he's played in an almost identical manner. Julie Warner stands out as the character who grabs the viewer's attention, by fair means and foul. Eric Thal, on the other hand, is like Keanu Reeves. You could replace him with a wooden plank that has a mean face painted on it, and nobody would know the difference. Richard Belzer stands out in an almost-wordless cameo. Anyone else in the film never gets the chance to distinguish themselves.The second half and inadequate characterisation of the film would have been easy to overcome if only one of them were present. The only problem is that third, fourth, even fifth problems are added. One major problem is the sheer volume of exposition that is delivered through dialogue. It is one thing to tell us how character X felt sensation Y at moment Z. To do this without flashbacks or recapping footage from new angles is a difficult ask at best, and with a cast of this calibre, it simply shouldn't be done.Ironically, the concept of The Puppet Masters was done slightly better in a direct-to-video sequel to StarShip Troopers. The concept of an alien parasite using a host for a sinister purpose was also done better in The Thing. If you've already seen those films, then The Puppet Masters is worth checking out.

But then there are films that we watch and we know we have been changed forever. These are the films that we usually call our top 10 or top 100 and usually most of us will agree on specific titles, concluding that a particular film is truly a GREAT film.Black Cat White Cat is what I can call the Greatest film I have ever watched. It is of course quite a strong title to give a film, knowing such classics as Citizen Kane, The Godfather Part 1 and 2, I Am Cuba, 2001 A Space Odyssey, Seven Samurai or even Birth of a Nation have all at one time or another been given such a title by not just an individual...but by a panel of judges and critics from around the world. But there is something that this film has...a beauty, something absolutely magical and romantic...a fantasy that you only find in children's books, and yet it exists in this loud and clattered noisy film. How Emir Kustarica has done this is beyond my understanding. I first discovered Kustarica's films while living in England when one night I turned to ITV on a Thursday night and began watching The Time Of The Gypsies. I remember my mom really complained because it was 2am when the film started and we were going to Kent early the next morning but I told her I would go to sleep soon. Needless to say, the film was almost 3 hours long.. but it did prove to be a favorite of mine for a very long time...until I watched 2001 A Space Odyssey. So I battled in my mind...why do I enjoy these films more than the films others enjoy such as the Godfather? Why is my taste so different? I guess, different people enjoy different things, but we can all conclude a good smell, and evil and wicked mind...a soft breeze. What we cannot seem to agree on, is when a good film touches our hearts. The events that place in Black Cat White Cat are ridiculous and sometimes unreal. There is a scene where a band are playing while suspended on a tree...there is a dwarf girl whose single wish is to meet a tall dark handsome man, there is an arranged marriage, a dead grandfather...but what does it all mean or lead to? There are situations that are unbelievable and dreamlike, yet they are told in a very honest and sincere way that you believe them...unlike the films of David Lynch where you see something and its so mesmorizing you wonder.. is that even possible?. This film however dazzles you with the thought of what you just saw is real..because you just saw it. Its difficult to explain, but what you see in this film is a haunting, true, ridiculous and romantic situation that is beyond logic and yet so true to human nature. So is this my favorite film? I don't know. This film feels like part of my body. How am I supposed to say what is my favorite body part? How am I to choose my limbs over my heart? What I got out of this film is something I cannot even understand. I feel in love with film all over again. Maybe that was Mr. Kustarica's goal...to show us a romantic episode and hope it helps us reflect our own cluttered life. Or maybe he simply wanted to show a lifestyle of gypsies in Yugoslavia. I really don't mind not understanding the reason for his making this film because I like my confusion.

Because telling even a bit too much would ruin a whole lot of this movie.Based on a famous novel with the same title by Patricia Highsmith, The talented Mr Ripley begins in the US in the 50s and tells about, you can guess, Tom Ripley. The young man lives in a poor flat in New York and although being a very talented piano player and an intelligent man, Ripley just cannot succeed in becoming rich as he's got not many opportunities and connections. But one day, destiny offers him a chance and he takes it He plays piano at a party of rich Mr Greenleaf and because Tom cannot afford a jacket, he borrows it from a friend. By chance, the jacket has the sign of the Princeton University on it and Mr Greenleaf thinks that Tom was a student at this university, just as his own son, Richard (Dickie). So, when being asked the question Have you been in Princeton with my son? Tom could have said the truth but he lies instead, which turns out to be good for him or maybe not so good if you see what consequences this lie is about to have. It all begins with a trip to Italy Dickie lives there with Marge, his girlfriend, what you would call a dolce vita &#150; a sweet life without sorrows, all financed by his daddy's money. Now Mr Greenleaf begs Tom to go to Italy and force Dickie to come back and take over his father's company. Tom of course willingly agrees, as Mr Greenleaf pays the whole trip. However, after arriving in Italy and making friends with Dickie, Tom's intentions become clearer and he would do anything to get what he wants.It is one of those movies where many things are not what they seem and of course this is the most enjoyable and shocking about this film. It always tries to comfort the viewer with the beautiful Italian landscape and the sweet lazy way of living in the fifties just to shock him some moments later. The movie is a masterpiece and the most incredible thing about it is definitely its protagonist. When the movie begins you think Oh, he's just like one of those guys, who are bullied at school, basically are clever but absolute freaks. Freaky &#150; never has an adjective fitted better than in this case. During the movie Tom reveals more and more of his true personality and we sense that this freak could really be dangerous, yet nobody surrounding Tom senses it. They all are delighted &#150; Tom is charming, looks good, you can have a conversation with him, he's even somewhat seductive. But he has another face and nobody senses the danger until it comes to the surface &#150; and then it's too late.Minghella has created a masterpiece, which contains everything &#150; incredibly beautiful shots of Italy and its upper class, a great music score, love, hate, friendship, betrayal, suspense and an ending which makes me run out of words. Also a big compliment to the perfectly casted protagonists. Matt Damon is very convincing as Tom Ripley, though after seeing him in Good Will Hunting my first thought was that he was miscast, but he is perfect in this role. Jude Law as Dickie Greenleaf is incredibly handsome, incredibly arrogant and incredibly blind &#150; a superb performance by Law, but I think he always does great work. Even Gwyneth Paltrow, whom I usually don't like that much, has a touch of class and is very likeable as Marge &#150; elegant, feminine and, yes, cute. Another remarkable performances by the incredibly elegant and charming Cate Blanchett and British actor Jack Davenport (probably best known from Pirates of the Caribbean), but the rest of the supporting cast also does good work.

Tom could have said the truth but he lies instead, which turns out to be good for him or maybe not so good if you see what consequences this lie is about to have. It all begins with a trip to Italy Dickie lives there with Marge, his girlfriend, what you would call a dolce vita &#150; a sweet life without sorrows, all financed by his daddy's money. Now Mr Greenleaf begs Tom to go to Italy and force Dickie to come back and take over his father's company. Tom of course willingly agrees, as Mr Greenleaf pays the whole trip. However, after arriving in Italy and making friends with Dickie, Tom's intentions become clearer and he would do anything to get what he wants.It is one of those movies where many things are not what they seem and of course this is the most enjoyable and shocking about this film. It always tries to comfort the viewer with the beautiful Italian landscape and the sweet lazy way of living in the fifties just to shock him some moments later. The movie is a masterpiece and the most incredible thing about it is definitely its protagonist. When the movie begins you think Oh, he's just like one of those guys, who are bullied at school, basically are clever but absolute freaks. Freaky &#150; never has an adjective fitted better than in this case. During the movie Tom reveals more and more of his true personality and we sense that this freak could really be dangerous, yet nobody surrounding Tom senses it. They all are delighted &#150; Tom is charming, looks good, you can have a conversation with him, he's even somewhat seductive. But he has another face and nobody senses the danger until it comes to the surface &#150; and then it's too late.Minghella has created a masterpiece, which contains everything &#150; incredibly beautiful shots of Italy and its upper class, a great music score, love, hate, friendship, betrayal, suspense and an ending which makes me run out of words. Also a big compliment to the perfectly casted protagonists. Matt Damon is very convincing as Tom Ripley, though after seeing him in Good Will Hunting my first thought was that he was miscast, but he is perfect in this role. Jude Law as Dickie Greenleaf is incredibly handsome, incredibly arrogant and incredibly blind &#150; a superb performance by Law, but I think he always does great work. Even Gwyneth Paltrow, whom I usually don't like that much, has a touch of class and is very likeable as Marge &#150; elegant, feminine and, yes, cute. Another remarkable performances by the incredibly elegant and charming Cate Blanchett and British actor Jack Davenport (probably best known from Pirates of the Caribbean), but the rest of the supporting cast also does good work.

The film has no actual scares... just a bunch of sequences that might seem scary if you believe them, which requires you to be very naive. What could have been a decent enough attempt at a semi-scary documentary is ruined by it containing scenes that there is no possible reason that any sane person would film(if it were real), including arguments, fights and various pointless conversations. The worst thing about this film is that there are actually people who believe it. People who think that this film was a true documentary, and that everything on the film happened. I can't believe that there are people who are actually that naive and superstitious, that they'll accept something so blatantly obvious fake as real. I mean, I don't have anything against people who believe in ghosts and witches, not at all, don't believe any of it myself, but I wouldn't entirely write it off as rubbish if someone was trying to convince me it does exist; but to go from believing in it, to grabbing something so obviously fake and try to pass it off as evidence in these phenomenons...

No doubt we'll be seeing some polemical do gooder film maker with zero talent making a movie where anyone who gets murdered by the gay girls probably asked for it because they were a rabid homophobeThat was my abstract opinion of HEAVENLY CREATURES when it was released to some critical acclaim ten years ago , with much of the acclaim going to writer\/director Peter Jackson whose previous gory horror comedies I'd enjoyed . Yeah the guy was talented I remember thinking , but in a liberal climate we'd no doubt be hearing a myriad of excuses via the film for the girls crime and it was this attitude that stopped me from watching the movie until it was broadcast on BBC 2 tonight I was fooling myself if I thought Jackson was going to make a bad movie . This is another piece of heart melting , intelligent movie making from the Kiwi genius and I'm sorry for doubting Jackson for a moment . What Jackson has done has made a movie where it's difficult to think of the two protagonists as  lesbian lovers  , Pauline Reiper and Juliet Hulme are two teenagers who love each other full stop and the screenplay doesn't once make any excuses for anything that happens , we're not supposed to feel disgusted by their relationship , we're not supposed to feel that they are victims in any way and we're not supposed to feel that a conservative , homophobic society is to blame for what happened . Jackson deserves much credit for making an amoral movie without an agenda , it's up to the free thinking audience to make up their own minds on the case. Take for example the murder of Mrs Rieper who kindly takes the girls to a tea house then for a walk in the countryside . It's difficult not to notice that if she'd been an uncaring cruel dragon with absolutely no conscience the girls wouldn't have had an opportunity to murder the woman .It's also a movie that captures the spirit of being a teenager in love . When for whatever reason you have to say goodbye to your first love it's the end of the world . You'll do anything to stop it happening - ANYTHING - and you won't forgive anyone who caused it to happen . Fantasy sequences similar to the ones shown here are also a staple diet of the teenage mind and if you disagree with me you're either being dishonest or you're under twelve years of age . Believe me this movie reminded me , perhaps a little too much , of my own teenage angst Jackson also deserves credit for his casting Melanie Lynskey and ( A then totally unknown ) Kate Winslet as Pauline and Juliet . Neither of them can be described as strikingly attractive and you do have to worry who we would have got instead if this was a Hollywood production , but they play the star crossed lovers with absolute conviction , as indeed do the rest of the castHEAVENLY CREATURES is beautiful , haunting , thoughtful and incisive . With the exception of Martin Scorsese I rate Peter Jackson as the world's greatest living film maker and HEAVENLY CREATURES is the first movie that showed the true greatness Jackson is capable of  ","genre":"Biography, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"3 July 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  I recently saw a comment where someone said they didn't think it was necessary that Uncle Ben die.Whoever made that comment obviously knows nothing about the origin of Spider-Man as is it written in MArvel Comics.Peter Parker becomes Spider-man after a failed attempt as a wrestler and his Uncle is killed by a criminal that Peter himself could have stopped, but he didn't.READ THE COMIC.It reads the same way!It make me sick when people who know nothing about the comic book start commenting on stuff that they know nothing about!!!Espcially when they start dissing it!At least know what you're talking about.You have to be familiar with and appreciate comics to be fans of these sort of movies.Kinda funny that you're dissing a Batman movie but outside of the movie you don't know a damn thing about the Dark Knight, huh?I think the Spider-Man film was good, but the story-line could have been better.I mean come on!

Well, I decided to revisit it and finally see Batman and Robin in the past week and well, this movie still has absolutely no redeeming values.We can't even get a minute into the film when we are introduced to Val Kilmer as Batman in the batcave as the corporate sell out. I'll get drive thru he responds to Alfred after he had offered him a sandwich to go (I remember the stupid McD's tie-in commercial). Good to know the filmmakers are straight with us and let us know there is no integrity in this bat-world.Kilmer is a robot as Bruce Wayne AND as Batman. Some lines almost sound as if they can't even get out because he is just so incredibly rigid. The dialogue is of course, idiotic, but then what did we expect. Joel Schumacher began his deconstruction of the franchise with non-stop MTV cuts and completely gratuitous dutch angles, not to mention every damned shot has every color in the spectrum represented in it! That's not art, that's a bad excuse for not having a visual style.The villains - ugghhh!!! It was such a bad idea to combine two villains that are basically identical. They are both totally 100% insane. They don't compliment each other at all, instead they annihilate you with a never-ending barrage of craziness and bad over-acting. Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey were two of the five most in-demand actors at the time and they got top billing, but Carrey is simply the wrong choice for the Riddler and worse, the character of the Riddler is now a scientist!!!??? Two-Face is a poor man's version of the Joker without the grandeur and presence of Nicholson's great madness. Drew Barrymore is utterly wasted in a nothing role. Chris O'Donnell is given the thankless role of Robin and gets to be the sidekick to the robot, Batman. I don't even remember seeing Commissioner Gordon; his role was so useless. Nicole Kidman looking so beautiful is actually the single thing that got me through the film.I could go on and on, but ultimately this film is really responsible for killing the Batman franchise. The series lost its' soul, as we no longer followed Batman the character. In this film there are weak attempts to copy the first film by showing Bruce Wayne contemplating over his parents' deaths again. This is pointless because we've tread down this path before. We don't get anything new.Batman Forever actually launched this modern style we are stuck in with tons of ridiculous effects and ignoring the great story and artistic style that made the first two Batman films good. Most recent films such as Van Helsing are carbon copies of this empty film. Glitzy colors, cuts and famous actors - no script or care for characters and no care to create a plausible world within the realm of fantasy.***BTW - Worst moment - Batman avoiding getting trapped in the alley by Two-Face's gang and then driving the Batmobile up the wall. And then they cut to the next scene as if we naturally can figure out where the hell he drove next after heading skyward.
