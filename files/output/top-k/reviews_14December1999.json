In this case, Gilliam was the King of outlandish big screen adventures, made cynical when his previous film flopped.   Richard La Gravanese was the unknown screenwriter whose heart-warming tale reinvigorated the Monty Python veteran.It's an old fashioned love story and a heart warming tale of redemption that has lost little of its impact in the years since its release.Gilliam may be seen by many to be a mad genius, but in a crazy but rather safe world of Hollywood, where most film-makers are emulating the last big hit, he has always stuck his neck out and come up with the goods.After countless projects - including a version of comic book hit, Watchmen, fell by the wayside. the director started wondering if he'd ever make another film. Then he received a script by newcomer La Gravanese - who has since gone on to pen heart-warming movies such as The Bridges of Madison County and The Mirror Has Two Faces. Suddenly, Terry realised that less is definitely more and ditched his trademark, sweeping visions of cities under siege and elaborate, gothic sets for more humble backdrops.The movie centres on Jack Lucas (Jeff Bridges), a superstar talk radio DJ in the Howard Stern mould. After advising     an unhinged fan to wipe out a yuppie watering hole, Lucas is naturally shocked when the madman obliges.    Following many months of regret, the suicidal Lucas is saved from a gang of thugs by tramp Parry (Robin  Williams). It turns out the two men's fates are intertwined in a plot twist which leads Jack to try and make amends. Back in 1991, Gilliam realised that huge budgets and inspired special effects may be great eye candy but compared  to the power of four well-drawn actors and a cracking script, all the fireworks in China couldn't recreate the dramatic                                 fireworks that ignite the screen here.  At the time, Williams was one of the world's biggest box office draws but many were growing tired of his familiar    manic patter. As a result, he seems to be the weakest link in a quartet of actors including the sublime Bridges,          Amanda Plummer and Mercedes Ruehl (who picked up an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress).A sublime comedy drama which is filled with many notable scenes Bridges sat at the foot of a statue in Central Park  with a Pinocchio Doll; Williams' rendition of I Like New York In June; Ruehl's sassy video shop owner, Anne, and  Plummer's oddball loner, Lydia, attempting to choose a video in Anne's shop - look out for Munchausen and Brazil                         posters dotted around the premises as a Gilliam in-joke. It's also littered with familiar faces including John De Lancie (Star Trek's Q), Frasier's David Hyde Pierce and Tom                                    Waits as a disabled veteran.   Don't miss the jaw-dropping dance scene at Grand Central Station, the hilarious meal and Michael Jeter as the                                 outrageously camp singing telegram. The movie also boasts some fine photography by Gilliam's regular collaborator Roger Pratt.

Though I didn't think THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION was the greatest movie ever made, I did like it a lot, I liked Stephen King's serialized novel, and I like the cast.  So how did this movie go wrong?  Well, wrong is perhaps too strong a word, since there are good things about it.  All the performances are good, and there are moments of real power(***SPOILER ALERT*** Like when Sam Rockwell grabs Michael Duncan.  Having read the novel, I knew it was coming, but Frank Darabont sets it up so well it truly is a shock. ***END SPOILER ALERT***).  And maybe my opinion of the film is tempered by the fact the theater showing it had projector trouble about 2\/3 of the way through.  But I don't think that's it.One of the reason King's stories, when he's on, are so good is his characters are just ordinary people.  He doesn't try to make them insufferably noble.  And while the supernatural is his territory, he makes sure he grounds it in reality.  But in this movie, that goes out the window.  I know John Coffey is a symbol, but in the novel he was also a real human being, and here, he's just a symbol, which gets to be tiring after awhile.  And while I know this is a fable, and not a realistic story, Darabont lays things on awfully thick, especially when Hanks finds out what really happened to those two girls.  If I remember correctly, in the novel, he finds that out on his own, which is part of what I meant about grounding it in reality.  And while I am not among those who think movies are too long(if you think about it, a lot of the really good movies this decade have been over two hours), this feels longer than its 3 hour plus running time.As I said, I didn't hate this movie, but considering the talent involved, it has to be counted as a disappointment.

It's become such a cliche that kids aren't being entertained like they used to (don't fear TARZAN, though, a wonderful movie).I knew I was going to enjoy this movie's retro 50s-like animation immensely, but I was surprised how much more I enjoyed. The movie isn't concerned how life-like the characters are, because ultimately it's the actions that make them more realistic than how they appear.Eli Marienthal's voice is incredibly convincing as the young boy Hogarth and the title robot is the most enjoyable and friendly creature to watch since E.T. almost twenty years ago.

This is a great film when the actors are allowed to take centre stage Robert De Niro was becoming America's greatest film actor, Christopher Walken was establishing himself as a brilliant young talent, and even the woman I love to hate, Meryl Streep, delivered a stunningly nuanced performance. The supporting cast is near flawless, and it's always a delight to see Shirley Stoler in any film, even when she's playing a Serbian mama.The Deer Hunter suffers when director Michael Cimino's need to make a statement and screenwriter Deric Washburn's need for a cinematic metaphor overwhelm what could have been a terrific straightforward story. Cimino's recurring use of the hunting theme is totally over the top, especially when the Serbian church music swells in the background as De Niro stalks his prey. The symbolism in The Deer Hunter is unnecessary and so in your face as to be a major distraction. As for Washburn, all one can say is that he obviously never met a Vietnamese  he didn't hate. To say his depictions of Vietnamese are racist is perhaps an understatement they are shown as either brutal butchers who have nothing better to do than torture prisoners and shoot civilians, or jabbering idiots who gamble endlessly on the other overworked symbol of the film, Russian Roulette. The fact that The Deer Hunter was shot in Thailand--an American ally to the end of the Indochinese Wars--makes me guess that the Thai crew and actors were more than happy to present their Communist neighbours to the East as maddened animals. All the better to keep Thailand within the realm of American national interests, I imagine. By all means see this film for De Niro and Walken. Try and ignore the sound and the fury, and focus on the brilliance of their performances.

I had to play some video pinball to get to the essence of The Straight Story.  I saw it some time back, but the details of the entire film had gotten jumbled up in my mind, and I knew that what this movie was really about was somewhere in my thoughts but all in a fog.So on the computer screen I flipped a flipper here and there, scored some points and drained a few steel pinballs.  But that hazy picture was clearing the whole time. I was catching glimpses of the details and substance of this film, which I remember as being at times silly, but mostly riveting.  The silly allowed you to be glad to smile in the midst of the necessary slow pace of the story.  After all, just how fast can Alvin the old geezer (Richard Farnsworth) travel, anyway, on a riding lawn mower hundreds of miles across several states?  (Oh, and pulling a trailer, too!)And so now, I do remember that I had forgotten the cool lesson Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) teaches a roadside runaway who, in turn, finds herself ready to correct some decisions she had made in fear and shame (good quality);  that I had forgotten that the famous cigarette man-in-the-saddle rides much of the range in middle America (not so good quality);  that I had forgotten that even though all's supposed to be fair in love and war, that both of those arenas of life are strewn with the hurting wounded who will NEVER believe that time-tattered saying, for Rose (Sissy Spacek) was trampled in love, and Alvin was shaken in war, and life -- both of them nursing niggling memories that will not go away, caused by unfairnesses in earlier years that robbed her of hope and him of innocence, and tenderness for a brother;  that I had forgotten that the seemingly endless and sometimes corny journey on which Alvin embarked was also seemingly endless in real-time movie-watching-in-the-theater minutes;  that I had forgotten about the sweeping panoramic photography in which you get lost, and in which your own real-time troubles get just as lost.Since seeing this film several weeks ago, I really HAD gotten fuzzy on all these things. But even so, now, I realize that by the end of the film, absolutely none of all the above even matters. These are only the garments the film is dressed in...For, you see, the film is really about only one thing a man's softening heart intent on fixing a rotted bridge suspended over a horrible, deep gap of disgust and blame, which, if not repaired in time, is going to be the source of unfixable regret.And the last 10 minutes of the film  simple, haunting, and tension filled, with excruciating silences.  Only a man willing to be a real man will understand the language of that kind of silence.See it.

But that hazy picture was clearing the whole time. I was catching glimpses of the details and substance of this film, which I remember as being at times silly, but mostly riveting.  The silly allowed you to be glad to smile in the midst of the necessary slow pace of the story.  After all, just how fast can Alvin the old geezer (Richard Farnsworth) travel, anyway, on a riding lawn mower hundreds of miles across several states?  (Oh, and pulling a trailer, too!)And so now, I do remember that I had forgotten the cool lesson Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) teaches a roadside runaway who, in turn, finds herself ready to correct some decisions she had made in fear and shame (good quality);  that I had forgotten that the famous cigarette man-in-the-saddle rides much of the range in middle America (not so good quality);  that I had forgotten that even though all's supposed to be fair in love and war, that both of those arenas of life are strewn with the hurting wounded who will NEVER believe that time-tattered saying, for Rose (Sissy Spacek) was trampled in love, and Alvin was shaken in war, and life -- both of them nursing niggling memories that will not go away, caused by unfairnesses in earlier years that robbed her of hope and him of innocence, and tenderness for a brother;  that I had forgotten that the seemingly endless and sometimes corny journey on which Alvin embarked was also seemingly endless in real-time movie-watching-in-the-theater minutes;  that I had forgotten about the sweeping panoramic photography in which you get lost, and in which your own real-time troubles get just as lost.Since seeing this film several weeks ago, I really HAD gotten fuzzy on all these things. But even so, now, I realize that by the end of the film, absolutely none of all the above even matters. These are only the garments the film is dressed in...For, you see, the film is really about only one thing a man's softening heart intent on fixing a rotted bridge suspended over a horrible, deep gap of disgust and blame, which, if not repaired in time, is going to be the source of unfixable regret.And the last 10 minutes of the film  simple, haunting, and tension filled, with excruciating silences.  Only a man willing to be a real man will understand the language of that kind of silence.See it.

However, Frank Darabont keeps a very similar mood in The Green Mile. To start off, the movie is very well acted, particularly by Sam Rockwell and Ron Hutchinson.( Rockwell's Wild Bill is one of the most spontaneous and crazy villains I've ever seen.) David Morse plays his role with quiet dignity,and Tom Hanks is pretty good, but I wouldn't expect any nominations coming his way for his performance. The direction deals with the film in a way that makes the length very appropriate. The scenes before Duncan's John Coffey is introduced, are not rushed, and allow the viewer to fully capture the atmosphere of the death row strip known as The Green Mile.              However, the movie is cursed with melodrama. (Why do directors add a score to a film's most sincere moments?!? Can't they see this ruins the impact?!?) This is not to say that you won't be touched by John Coffey, or the killing off of certain characters, but it does water the moments down a little.    But the thing I like most about The Green Mile, that I'm sure many viewers will hate, is how much it leaves to the viewer's imagination. It allows the viewer to think about the various levels of meaning in the film, by leaving certain events open to mystery. Some parts are excellently directed, but overall, it's a disappointment given all the anticipation. I'd give it a 7 on the imdb scale.
