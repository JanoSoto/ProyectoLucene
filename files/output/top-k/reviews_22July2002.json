[{"date":"22 July 2002","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Rushmore is a highly original film about unfulfilled promise, loneliness, and people with exuberant energy who are completely unfocused. It is a film I didn't care for on first viewing (I thought the characters were simply awkward constructs of the writer\/director), but decided to see it again after having enjoyed The Royal Tenenbaums. This time I definitely felt much more in tune with the director's bizarre brilliance. Rushmore is about Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), an unusual high school student who underachieves in classes at Rushmore, an exclusive prep school, and is under constant threat of expulsion because he spends all of his time a litany of extracurricular activities. With Max, Wes Anderson has developed a character that is highly intelligent, very creative, yet a lonely underachiever unable to deal with the expectations of society (similar in a way to Donnie Darko, another character who is brilliant yet unfocused).Max becomes infatuated with pretty first grade teacher Rosemary. Cross (Olivia Williams), and enlists the aid of his friend Herman Blume (Bill Murray), a millionaire industrialist, to build an aquarium at the school in Ms. Cross's honor. By forgetting to tell the school administrators about the aquarium, Max is expelled from Rushmore and attends the local public school. He goes into virtual combat with the much older Blume, determined to conquer his foe and win his lady's hand.Rushmore is very human and charming. Max reminded me a little of myself at a point in my life that I was able to laugh at my own vanity and pretensions. With great performances and an outstanding soundtrack, Rushmore is a thoroughly engaging film from a director who, for me, fits the phrase comic genius.

Indie hit at Sundance doesn't always mean surefire instant classic as proven in this precious mix of `The Catcher in the Rye' meets `Rushmore' via `The Graduate' snob prep schooler Stanford (suggesting Topher Grace's lethargic brother) returns to his Upper West Side environs for Thanksgiving break to announce his long-hidden secret to his step mother (Weaver) he loves her.  Along the way instead he's detoured into a troubling one-nighter with her best friend (Neuwirth, the true saving grace of this overrated film) who proves to be a problem with his desire to come clean about his notions of what love is.  Weaver's talent is muted here but Ritter provides some much needed comic relief in one of cinema's best 'choke takes' ever seen. The biggest setback of this otherwise tedious debut by director Gary Winick (who collaborated with his writers Niels Mueller and Heather McGowan) is its anti-hero being such a one-note faux intellectual spouting quotes form Voltaire and pretending not to like girls his age (notably the fetching Mara) that one wants to ring his neck from frustration of his dreadful putting on airs.  Why anyone would find him attractive is beyond me since he is a total turn off socially; speaking French only hastens the matter!  What could've been a slice of a John Updike short story in its approach fails in its myopic assumption of creating a cult hero like Benjamin Braddock or Holden Caulfield.
