[{"date":"11 July 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" October Sky is one of the best coming-of-age films out there to watch. It has the theme of kids should do want they want to do, not what their parents decide for them. My favorite part of the movie is how the relationship between father and son was depicted. In most movies like this, the father is often depicted as the tyrant. But, while he is strict here, he is not as bad as most of these fathers. The film is boasted by lovable, relatable characters, a very strong screenplay, and great direction.Joe Johnston's film is about how four guys including Homer Hickam in a coal-mining town decide to create a rocket against the will of everyone in town besides their encouraging teacher.The acting is very good. Young Jake Gyllenhaal portrays Homer and he is a very good actor, much better than other child actors. Chris Cooper was really good as his father and I didn't hate him as much as I thought I would. Laura Dern is pretty good as the teacher, but I believe she over-acted just a little.Overall, this is a fantastic film for all ages to see. I'm sure this film could hit notes with the older generation who grew up in the 1950's. The movie inspires everybody that they can be who they want to be, and they must not let anyone get in their way. I rate this film 10\/10.
