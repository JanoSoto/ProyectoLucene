The fart jokes help establish the main character and the mood of Shrek - Shrek is a crude ogre and the movie is not your average fairy tale. I don't know why anyone would criticize the animation - it's really fabulous. And the plot itself is very well-written; it does a good job of satirizing Disney and just fairy tales in general, and all the characters are very non-cliche. This movie is very enjoyable and I would highly recommend it. ","genre":null},{"date":"2 March 2002","score":"","review":"  Please, people. You don't like the fart jokes? The key word is context.

The main character is the most inane, shallow, vapid, vain and annoying bimbo I've ever seen on a movie screen.It's a shame these days we tend to promote vanity as a virtue. This story about the struggles of an incredibly shallow young woman in her career and love life made me physically sick. Finding a good man isn't that hard, unless you're like Bridget Jones, an impossible to please cow who wants and will only be happy a perfect man, despite the fact she's meant to have low self confidence. In other words, an imperfect woman who expects and demands a perfect man, and we're supposed to laugh and endear ourselves to her at her attempts to snag one, and this comparatively carries over into her professional life, where she wants fame and fortune despite very little talent or aptitude. The classic example of women wanting everything despite having nothing that entitles her to it.I see this entire movie as a huge statement on the double standards that women live by in these modern times. Any young women who see this film should take a good look at Bridget and want to be as little like her as possible, because she is an awful, awful character.Give this film a miss if you have any intelligence to be insulted.

Helena Bonham-Carter is gorgeous as Lucy, a constrained English girl who is vacationing in Italy, closely guarded by her pathetically uppity elder cousin Charlotte. Everything is dazzling in this film from the sumptuous Italian setting to classical music to the Victorian costumes(and Helena Bonham-Carter's hair). The characters are all hilarious in their individual parts, but Daniel Day-Lewis absolutely steals the show with his portrayal of Cecil Vyse, an insufferably narcissistic gentleman of birth and breeding.The film can best be summarized by the Rev.
