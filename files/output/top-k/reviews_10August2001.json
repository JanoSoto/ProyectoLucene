Only a few times could it be said that a sequel deserves the classic status of its original. The Godfather 2 is an example, but it is really not a sequel, but a continuation, Aliens is a sequel that is even better than its predecessor. Most sequels that are entertaining but mostly forgettable.Now, on to Jaws 2! When this movie came out I was only 9 years old and even then, i had loved Jaws. So most people regard it as a disappointment, which is in a way, unfair, because it is a well crafted movie. It has a basic structure that is similar to the original, Chief Brody warning the town's head honchos that a shark is endangering Amity island. Roy Scheider again is terrific as Brody, he plays him as an intelligent but obsessed man, deeply affected by what he had gone thru 3 years earlier. The other star of the film obviously is the shark. The first film benefited from not seeing much of the shark until the last half of the film. Anyone familiar with Jaws lore will remember that Spielberg and Co. could not get the mechanical shark to work most of the time, they HAD to focus more on suspense and character. The first film is a classic.In Jaws 2 the filmmakers really could not get away with not showing the shark, they Had to show it more. And yes, it looks fake most of the time,but It looked fake in the first one too, the action scenes are done very well. Well directed by Jeanott Szwarc, the shark scenes move quickly and sustain the suspense well. These days they would have used CGI, but as an example, Deep Blue Sea had the nifty CGI effects, but no suspense, I'll take good suspense over SFX any day!. Jaws 2 is not a masterpiece like its predecessor, but it doesn't try to be, the filmmakers wanted to entertain the audience in more of a monster movie fashion, and they succeeded.
