But Andy Kaufman was huge because of Taxi. Not because of Tony Clifton. Not because of his Elvis Impersonation. Not because of his wrestling.

By the time we start to see a little bit about Andy Kaufman and what people thought about him, he's already dead and buried. I always liked him, on and off Taxi. I recommend this flick only to those who have no idea what Andy Kaufman did while he was here. He wasn't a HUGE star, but he was an entertaining man. I'd be more interested in a film showing why a lot of stars who worked with him did not want any part of the film. Where was Tony Danza? I wish they explored his shock comic personality a little further. All in all, a bit of a disappointment, but a well done recreation of a lost comic. I hope Jim Carrey gets the respect he deserves this year. Milos can watch reruns of Taxi and think about how neat it would be to recreate Andy's scenes with a Tony Danza stand-in. 7 out of 10.

Later in life, he would ask his Mahareshi what the secret was to being funny and the response came back to be silent &#150; not the silence of absent sound but the silence of listening inwardly.  Kaufman's world never became a world we could understand.   Milos Foreman film, A Man in The Moon, while well-acted and directed, doesn't try to explain why Kaufman did what he did. Instead it chronicles the several well-publicized events of Kaufman's brief stardom with a near perfect portrayal by Jim Carrey.

But A Man in the Moon does not enlighten us to why a comic would push the envelope of his craft by performing as if he was still a boy, making mischief and not telling anyone about it, suffering and getting humiliated for the inward pleasure it derived.  Why did the film bring back many members of the &#145;Taxi' TV series including Marilou Henner, Judd Hirsch, Jeff Conaway (for that matter, Danny Devito) and then merely use them as props instead of integrating their take on Kaufman into the film?  Why did Kaufman's parents appear in largely non-speaking parts, again acting as props, when their dialogue would have been good source for explaining Kaufman's behavior.  Was Andy Kaufman a good prankster, a good showman forever putting on an act, or was he truly a comic genius?  A Man in the Moon suggest that he was all three.

Seeing the trailer for Bicentennial Man almost convinced me not to go near the picture to save my life. However my husband dragged me, kicking and screaming, to see it, and I am happy to say my prejudices in this case were completely wrong. Bicentennial Man has a lot of prejudices to overcome, rather like its self-deprecating hero. Firstly, it stars Robin Williams, whose ventures into sentiment and romance have been a bit questionable at times. Secondly the theme is probably one of the most overworked clichés of modern science fiction &#150; the android who wants to be human. And thirdly, it has to encompass a 200-year time span. All of these problems are handled with surprising competence as Chris Columbus delivers a sympathetic and sensitive film which manages to translate well to the nineties, despite the fact that Asimov's original story harks back to 1976, and has been visited many times by the likes of Gene Roddenberry. The script is a nice blend of humour and pathos without the sickly sentimentality you might expect of this Disney venture. The future world in which the characters live is only touched upon - and rightly so, the emphasis is always on the characters, not the setting.Williams is very good, and Chris Columbus should be congratulated for his direction of him &#150; Andrew is complex and believable and elicits the right amount of sympathy without being overdrawn. Sam Neill is terrific as Sir, a kind and generous master to a point - with some deep-seated prejudices he does not himself understand. All the other characters are nicely balanced against each other and the story paces itself pretty well overall, despite a few flags here and there. The ending raises some interesting moral issues but doesn't preach too hard.The best achievement is the makeup. It is quite simply the best ageing makeup I've ever seen in a modern film.

Seeing the trailer for Bicentennial Man almost convinced me not to go near the picture to save my life. However my husband dragged me, kicking and screaming, to see it, and I am happy to say my prejudices in this case were completely wrong. Bicentennial Man has a lot of prejudices to overcome, rather like its self-deprecating hero. Firstly, it stars Robin Williams, whose ventures into sentiment and romance have been a bit questionable at times. Secondly the theme is probably one of the most overworked clichés of modern science fiction &#150; the android who wants to be human. And thirdly, it has to encompass a 200-year time span. All of these problems are handled with surprising competence as Chris Columbus delivers a sympathetic and sensitive film which manages to translate well to the nineties, despite the fact that Asimov's original story harks back to 1976, and has been visited many times by the likes of Gene Roddenberry. The script is a nice blend of humour and pathos without the sickly sentimentality you might expect of this Disney venture. The future world in which the characters live is only touched upon - and rightly so, the emphasis is always on the characters, not the setting.Williams is very good, and Chris Columbus should be congratulated for his direction of him &#150; Andrew is complex and believable and elicits the right amount of sympathy without being overdrawn. Sam Neill is terrific as Sir, a kind and generous master to a point - with some deep-seated prejudices he does not himself understand. All the other characters are nicely balanced against each other and the story paces itself pretty well overall, despite a few flags here and there. The ending raises some interesting moral issues but doesn't preach too hard.The best achievement is the makeup. It is quite simply the best ageing makeup I've ever seen in a modern film. And not a cgi plate in sight here - all prosthetics. Great stuff. Overall a good movie to see if you are a fan of Isaac Asimov, Robin Williams, or just want a couple of hours of good entertainment with enough to chew over later on without getting too weighed down.

This, as many sequels, seems to forget what made the original so funny.  In the first, Austin is shown in the '60s as a swinger who has women falling all over him.  As stated by Mrs. Kensington, Women want him, and men want to be him.  When he's shown in the 90's, he's the same, but people don't react to his lines and body language the way they're supposed to.  That's what made his character so funny.  Now, in this movie, he spends most of his time in the 60's, where everyone reacts the right way. Plus, even in the opening in the 90's, everyone reacts to him the right way, like he fits in.  Honestly, Austin had about 2 scenes that were really funny.  Those were the Mini Me vs. Austin and the tent scenes.The movie does, however, have a huge redeeming quality.  That is Dr. Evil and his gang.  They were hilarious in the first and also great in the second.  Dr. Evil on Jerry Springer, in bed with Frau, and taking off into space (almost p***ed myself with this chain of jokes) were classics.  Dr. Evil definitely steals the show.Another downside, however, is Fat Bastard.  I don't know what Mike was thinking with this one, but I hardly ever laughed at anything he did except for singing the Chili's Baby Back Ribs song.  Overall, he was pretty sick. I gave this one a 7.

Since when does a visually interesting movie get scorned because of it's style?  This is absurd.  The fast pased editing does no less than allow Stone to fit more into the allotted timeframe than any other director.  Why do his characters seem more real than anyone else's?  Why do Stone's actors seem to be one notch better than the same actor in someone else's film?  Because of his style.  It allows for multiple layers of story and character.Now, on to Any Given Sunday, yet another triumph in the illustrious career of Mr. Stone.  To some, the football action done in closeup may be bothersome.  These folks would rather see a Fox broadcast with John Madden blithering incoherently and drawing all over the screen with his telestrator.  Well, we don't get that here, and I'm glad.  What we get, is football action from inside the huddle, the line of scrimmage, from inside a helmet being bounced around by 300 pound men.  This film is not about strategy, it is about brutality, physical brutality in terms of the players, and mental brutality in terms of Tony (Al Pacino).  We see the effects of the physical brutality on an aging quarterback, and the emotional, and mental effects on the coach, Pacino.  What we also have, is the brutality of greed.  Ah, there it is.  The famous Stone allegory.  We all know that Stone's films are not about the chosen subject, they are about something larger.  They are about America, about morality, about the media, about film itself.  This one is at its heart about bloodlust, for money, the bottom line.  It all traces back to the almighty dollar in this one.I saw a review posted on here stating something to the effect that this is also about age.  A very perceptive idea.  Stone, as an aging filmmaker, Pacino as an aging actor, it's all about age, about rekindling a love for ones art, Pacino's coach, and ultimately about Stone finding the fire within once again.I beleive that Stone was very emotionally hurt by the box office draw (or lack thereof) for Nixon.  One of the great epics of all time in my opinion. Here is a film that is half Citizen Kane, and half Godfather, and is succesful at this blend.  Incredible.  It's too bad he was scoffed at because he is inherently so polictical.  It's sad that this great work has been overlooked.  If you haven't given it a try, do so, you will not be sorry.  The first half up until the Republican convention of 1968 is the most masterful piece of directing of all time.  Believe me, it's that good. And what more can you ask from Anthony Hopkins?  Here is a man who CLEARLY does not look one bit like Richard Nixon, but makes one forget by the end what Nixon looked like.  Truly one of the most masterful performances ever by an actor.I digress, I am obviously a huge fan of Stone, so big a fan that I even forgave him for U-Turn, and eventually learned to like it.

Even so, I have to admit that Roman Holiday is a truly charming movie--worth every moment of screen time.  It is infinitely better than most of the schlock that Hollywood bills as romantic comedies today, although this is hardly great praise.  The cast is completely effective, and the movie exudes a lingering sense of youth, longing, and romance that I felt for many an hour after I watched the film.

Magnolia is a gripping, intense, flippant comedy-drama that keeps its motor going for its entire 179 minute run, never once running out of gas. An homage to great films like Nashville, Magnolia tells the stories of several different characters over the course of one fateful night.  Unique to this film is the fact that the characters all seem to carry some painful secret that comes to full fruition with the help of some great music. As the film opens, doors to the past are opened and painful memories are slowly revealed.  One of the opening scenes has Officer Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly) investigating a domestic dispute.  He finds a dead body in a woman's apartment.  This story isn't explored, so much as it is used (I suppose) as a metaphor for the stories to come.  Open up the closet and the skeletons come pouring out.Magnolia explores a multitude of subjects mostly surrounding family troubles.  The characters are intense, emotional wrecks.  Some of them may appear strong, however, as their pain creeps up on them they manage to crumble.  Anderson plays with our heads a bit in this outing.  Characters who we think are gentle beings turn out to be monsters.  Characters who we think are selfish pricks turn out to be fragile.  I must say that twenty four hours after seeing this film I still haven't got it all together.  Scenes are still swirling around in my head.  There is no point in running through the plot of this one because there was just so much happening on the screen that it would take forever and it would never make sense.  As a matter of fact, I think the narrator of this film warned us that that was the point of this film.The acting here is first rate.  Everyone delivers an Oscar calibre performance.  Stand outs include Tom Cruise as the 'Stephen Covey for macho men' guru and Julianne more as the frantically guilt-ridden opportunist who's rich older husband is dying.  Anderson reminds that Altman's style has been borrowed for this film by including Henry Gibson is a supporting-supporting role.  However, this is not an all-out rip off of Altman's work.  Somehow I doubt that anyone would have the guts to include some of the wonderfully bizarre plot twists that Anderson uses for this film.  I write this on December 30, 1999 and I suspect that those bull frogs will go down as the most indelible film image I have seen this century! --- And I have seen a lot of strange stuff!Just when we thought film makers had done it all, 1999 turns out to be a great year for unusual and original films.

I knew little about James Whale and the Frankenstein franchise, possessed virtually zilch experience with Bill Condon (aside from the trivial baggage that his previous _and first_ feature film was the Direct-To-Oblivion sequel to the Scariest-Movie-Of-All-Time-When-I-Was-Fourteen, Candyman.), and unceremoniously avoided anything to do with Brendan Fraser. So, there's not much I can say about historical accuracy, era juxtapositions, or tour-de-force performances. All I know comes from the ninety-eight or so minutes I had with the film.Which were pretty splendid, to say the least. What more, I was pleased by how little the film seemed to hit me over the head. Not with a lengthy diatribe over the political progressions of societal acceptance of diverse sexual orientations, not with any sort of disgusted expose of Hollywood's miscreants. Instead, I found a minimal but simplistically acceptable plot moved along by wonderful acting, vivid portrayals of what it's really like, beneath the typical distractions, gimmicks, and veils, to be a human being. Ian McKellan astounded me. Fact or fiction, he wasn't necessarily James Whale, but a complicated, reserved, and often misunderstood director who found a glimmer of intrigue and desire for his new gardener, Clayton Boone, played impeccably by Brendan Fraser. From their initial meeting with Whale indulging in staring at Boone hard-driving an edger, I was struck by a remarkable sense of kinship between the two, which only got better as the film unfolded. And, with Hanna--the third vertice of the bizarre love triangle--the edgy buffer between the men, I felt incredibly comfortable just watching three very different people open up to each other and to me. The irony of the title, Gods and Monsters, is that whether someone or something is considered a 'God' or 'Monster' is largely due to perception...human perception. We invent our gods and our monsters daily, and they are usually people we know, love, hate, or admire. I spent a very good ninety-eight minutes, mostly from being in the company of those three fellow humans.
