Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.- The Miranda WarningFor me, one of the best parts of RoboCop comes at the very end. An old man asks the robot, What's your name, son? The robot cop turns his head, sports a wan smile, and says, Murphy. Then as he turns to start to walk away the camera cuts to black and the theme song roars in as we read the bold print on-screen that says, ROBOCOP.RoboCop could be called a rip-off of The Terminator in many senses. The trailer even used the exact same theme song as that of Terminator. But RoboCop is a different story in many ways, and, in some ways, the action is even better than that in The Terminator (though I must include that the latter film is a better one overall).The film's hero, RoboCop, has a gentle affection to him absent in the evil Terminator, mainly because he is still human in some ways. It starts with a man named Murphy (Peter Wellers). Amid talks of a police strike, he and his new partner (Nancy Allen) chase down a pack of criminals to an abandoned warehouse. After being caught, graphically tortured and then shot in the head by the gang, Murphy is shipped off to a hospital whereupon he is announced dead on arrival.However, Murphy is revived by fusing his body together with that of a machine robot named RoboCop, the future of law enforcement. RoboCop is a cop who will never hold a strike against the police force, never take a bribe, never become corrupt in any way. There is only one problem with RoboCop--he has flashbacks of his past life and family. He also remembers who killed him. And so RoboCop sets off to find his killers.RoboCop is an action man's action movie. Things blow up, people get killed, and there are some impressive stunts. But all the while the movie keeps true to its core. The simple premise behind the film is nothing more than a B-movie so typically found in the era of the eighties (a decade of some very memorable, very forgettable, and\/or cheesy films). But it's nevertheless brought out of mediocrity by its lead performance from Peter Wellers, whose acting skills seemed pretty bad out of the suit rather than inside it, where he seems at home.Wellers (a.k.a. Buckaroo Bonzai) also extends a technique Arnold Schwarzenegger used in The Terminator. As a cyborg, Schwarzenegger would turn his head, then let the body follow. Wellers' character is even more rigid and robotic in movements than the T-800, and so he turns his head, for example, far to the right, and after a second his body spins on its heels and follows the head. Something like that takes a lot of concentration--just try walking around like that. Now add acting and remembering your lines. Wellers does a pretty good job.The director, Paul Verhoeven, knows how to construct a well-oiled action vehicle. He skips the bull and gets right to the harcore blood and guts stuff. But he does manage to bring a certain sense of connection with the character--and a sense of morals. Given another director, RoboCop would have been an average 80s film at best. Its plot vaguely resembles The Terminator, and the script isn't always A material. But Paul Verhoeven knows when and where to insert touching scenes (like when RoboCop goes through his old home and sees flashbacks), and he firmly grips the point of the story (messing with nature can be dangerous, not only physically but emotionally for the person you screwed around with). Another director helming a movie like this would never have thought to include such things. Unfortunately, Verhoeven does not know how to construct a film about a strip club (see Showgirls), but that's another story.RoboCop had amazing potential for sequels. Murphy's quest to find his family, to unlock his past, and to continue fighting crime are all the sort of stuff you hear about in comic books and comic book films. Unfortunately, the two sequels that followed RoboCop were major drags--the sort of films that RoboCop avoided becoming ever so carefully. Overblown, cheesy, stupid action flicks with no plot nor affection. As it stands, the third film has exactly 3.3 out of 10 stars on the IMDb, giving it a place on the Website's list of worst films of all time. I wouldn't go so far as to say the sequels were necessarily some of the worst films of all time, but after watching RoboCop you have an odd starvation to dig deeper into the film franchise and deeper into the story. The sequels kind of negate that starvation.RoboCop is a superhero movie, make no mistake about it. But it's an extraordinary one--an action film that starts and never lets up on its goals. And all the while it presents a truly lovable main character who is nothing more than a robot. In a time when every single action film out there presents us with overblown budgets, crappy acting, writing, directing, horrible buddies, and nothing but special effects we've seen mimicked since the release of The Matrix, RoboCop is a gentle reminder that, at one time, action movies were what they were--action movies--and the directors, writers and actors behind them had a wide range of talent.

From the time man created technology to the time technology fought back against man. 2001 A Space Odyssey is a movie like no other, it stands as a category of its own.  Legendary director Stanley Kubrick and author Arthur C. Clark have put together a spectacular masterpiece that can make one wonder about life and the universe.This is a story about the entire evolution and destiny of humanity, how it started and where it's headed.  It starts off showing how man got seperated from the ape species and went its own way like no other creature on earth had done before.  Four billion years ago, a spices of ape had lived as helpless scavengers, carefully feeding themselves at day, hiding together in caves at night, tribes fighting together with tribes over territory and muddy water but not knowing how to fight.  They were living in fear of predators, seeing their friends get attacked and killed and not knowing what to do about it.  Then one morning, a small tribe had been encountered by a mystical black, rectangular object which changed the way that this certain small group of apes think.  One ape discovered that he could use a bone as a weapon to attack others and defend himself, this was the very first wave of technology.  He uses it so his tribe could defend their territory against other apes.  This will be the tribe that will evolve into man.  The black object known as the monolith was calling man out to the orbit of Jupiter and it waited four billion years for man to have the capability to make it there so man can confront its true destiny.

By the way, if I hear someone claiming this is a French movie one more time...people will get hurt !! It's Belgian...at least give us that ! Roughly translated, the title means  it happened in your neighborhood and the movie is about a film crew that follows around a serial killer. At first, the just film his actions and ask for explanations. After a while, the crew becomes more involved and they start to work in team.C'est Arrivé près de chez vous is able to group several elements that are hard to group. It's a comedy in the first place, the blackest comedy you'll ever see. Ben - the murderer - talks about mutilating and killing like it's the most normal thing to do. He gives tips how to get rid of the body, he explains why you should stick to killing average people instead of rich or important people and that sort of things. You wonder whether you should laugh with it or feel uncomfortable... It's a satire and an ironic view on modern society but a pretty realistic one from time to time. The murders and the clean-up afterwards are shown very explicit and raw. The good thing about it is that, every time you start liking the character of the killer he does something that you can only abominate... Like a very brute and inhuman rape scene for example. This movie owes a lot of his power to the very fascinating performance by Benoît Poelvoorde. Ben shines as the normal looking man who can't really see the evil in what he does. Too bad Poelvoorde never received the fame and success he deserved after this film. He kept active in Belgium, in smaller and inferior movies. The reality-TV style of filming is great to build up the tension and to create the ideal atmosphere. With the vibrations of the camera and the close-ups of the characters, it really feels like you're there when it happens. For those of you who think that The Blair Witch Project introduced this kind of tension, I really advise you to watch this film and think again. This movie was the complete role model for films like Blair Witch Project ( the abrupt ending included !! ).

One of the reasons is the uproar it caused upon release when nosy little reporters found out it was not really based on true events like the disclaimer says at the beginning of the film. Then there was the tragedy of the Japanese woman who went looking for the buried stash of money and froze to death. The press had, what movie characters always call, a field day with this story. They overlooked the fact that she had left behind a suicide note and was informed by police the story was false upon arrival in Minnesota, where she was picked up by a worried police officer. She had a death wish.And the other reason for success is, of course, because the movie is one of the best of all films--a true story if ever there was one. It's more than a scathing social satire, more than a dark comedy, more than a great drama with a fabulous story filled with irony and coincedences and morals and so on and so forth. It's more than a great movie. It's superb.Marge Gunderson has become a sort of cultural character. People quote her like the Terminator or Charles Foster Kane or George Bailey or Darth Vader. She's so famous that I do not think many people realize Marge essentially comes in around forty minutes into the 98-minute movie. Yet that's what people think of when they hear the word Fargo--Marge Gunderson--and so it just shows what an impact a film like Fargo made. And not only impact, but the remembrance of characters we love to remember.Marge provides a sort of balance between the wild and the crazy. She is the moral character of the story who juggles the two and tries to keep them from falling. When the film starts to get violent or ironic Marge steps in to sort out the mess. The Coen Brothers, Ethan and Joel, obviously have a firm grasp on the actuality of storytelling as opposed to filmmakers who can simply put a story on screen--ignoring whether it provides any sort of actual storytelling at all.I think we all remember the first moment Marge wakes up in bed and receives the phone call. She drives out to the barren, frosty highway with a view of Minnesota that stretches for miles, and investigates the crime scene of a most brutal murder. Three people haev been murdered A cop, and two passersby. The villain(s)? Unknown. (Regarding the killer And by the size of his feet he looks like a big fella'!)The murders were, of course, all coincedental, having to do with a simple yet oddly complex plot Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) has debts he is unable to pay, so he hires two crooks, Carl (Steve Buscemi) and Gaeur (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife,  Jean (Kristin Rudrud). Unfortunately, their plan did not go to...er...plan, and they had to kill three people along the way.The point where Gauer shoots the police officer who has pulled the men over for not displaying the proper tags on their vehicle is funny. And yet when you really think about it, that scene shouldn't be funny at all. But it is. The Coen Brothers know how to make it funny. They are like experts of the dark humor--when Carl says, Whoa, Daddy! and has that speckle of blood on his face, I always burst out in laughter. It sounds sick, but strangely, it isn't.The dialogue in Fargo is just as excellent as the film's twisty little plot. Frances McDormand rightfully won an Oscar for her portrayal of Marge Gunderson. She speaks with the perfect accent of, what the Coen Brothers call, the language Minnesota Nice--where people are always cheery, even when they're being mean. It's just something inbred into citizens of Minnesota. And even when the worst things are happening to characters, you're smiling, because who doesn't love to hear, Gee, golly, gee whiz, throughout a movie, and who doesn't think it's funny?Fargo is the type of film you can watch over and over. Sometimes I think to myself that I'm just going to watch a scene or two, but as soon as the credits start the film has my interest and never lets go. It's the odd sort of delightful little film that keeps the viewer's interest for the first time up through the fiftieth time and beyond.The film's plot takes twist after twist and we can identify ever so much with the character of Jerry as all his well-thought-out plans go to waste, causing his debt to become even worse and his life even more ruined than it already is. Steve Buscemi, as Carl, is just as much a scene-stealer as Marge Gunderson (I love to type that name), and Jerry is just as much a lovable character as someone who hasn't hired two crooks to kidnap his wife. That's the secret to Fargo--or at least part of the secret. We like the characters, simply because we know they don't really mean any harm.

(I just hate when movies don't trust their audiences to make up their own minds, don't you?)More's the pity because the main story in Frailty is far more GENUINELY disturbing than the ridiculous, twist-a-minute mess that is the bookends.Then again, perhaps the most disturbing thing about this movie is that there will be viewers who agree with its message (and its messengers)...! Creepy.

They originally had wanted Robert Loggia in the role of the helium sniffing, obscenity screaming villian in this film. Frank Booth is a mutant from hell, the epitome of our worst nightmare only one we cannot wake up from. He makes Loren Singer on JAG look like your dear mother. Think of your worst nightmare and then scream as loud as you can and that is Frank Booth. One critic called this film the Hardy Boys go to hell. Kyle McLachin is wonderful as is Laura Dern, but they should have given my man Dennis the Oscar for his performance. He re-ignited a long stagnant career with this role and went on to make a whole new career as Hollywood's chief nut case isn't that wonderful. Dennis Hopper was born in Dodge City Kansas in 1936. He came to Hollywood in 1954 as a protege of James Dean. He was in Dean's films Rebel Without A Cause and Giant. He had a fight with Henry Hathaway on the set of From Hell To Texas. In two days and 100 takes he fought with him. This resulted in him being blacklisted from Hollywood. He took up painting and photography and did 140 tv shows before he did Easy Rider in 1969 with Peter Fonda. His next film, The Last Movie in 1971 was a bomb. He spent the next 14 years as a Hollywood exile. He did a few films like Tracks, Mad Dog Morgan, American Friend, Apocolypse Now and Out Of The Blue (which he also directed). However, his addictions took control of his life. He admitted he was doing 12 lines of cocaine, 28 beers and a gallon of rum a day before he finally went insane on a movie set, tore off his clothes and ran naked into the jungle. He finally cleaned himself up and made the most spectacular comeback in Hollywood history! He won raves for his role in Blue Velvet, an Oscar nomination for Hoosiers, he finally was able to direct a film called Colors that won critical esteem, he won an Emmy nomination for Paris Trout and Doublecrossed and was in the blockbuster hit Speed. Dennis Hopper is one of the most amazing survivors and actors and geniuses of our time. He is a man who went thru hell and came out the other edge. He walks a highwire thru hell in Blue Velvet and lets us hang onto our seats.

In real life Ed Norton reminds me of the Kevin character from HARRY ENFIELD AND CHUMS with his floppy hairstyle and his back to front baseball cap but he always gives a good performance . In this movie he gives a GREAT performance as Derek the skin head from hell . Edward Furlong also gives a GREAT performance as Derek`s younger brother Danny . Norton earned an Oscar nod but strangely Furlong seemed to miss out , a pity . Tony Kaye also shows us he had great potential as a director , and it`s one helluva shame it`s unlikely we`ll be seeing either Furlong or Kaye as big Hollywood names***** SPOILERS *****But it`s the script that brings the film down , and in some places it`s quite woeful . Derek kills a couple of armed home boys who turn up at his house and he`s convicted of manslaughter . I know this is a plot device but couldn`t it have been better done ? Is it possible any jury would have convicted Derek for protecting his property from armed burglers . I guess all the jurors were called Goldberg and Rubinstein ?

This is not a good Steve Martin movie, and I found it very irritating rather than funny. This is the first of four films which are Carl Reiner directing Steve Martin collaborations, and it is certainly the weakest.Steve Martin plays Navin Johnson, a moron, an idiot or a jerk, who basically encounters many situations on his exploration of the world. He finds love, works as a gas attendant, communicates with dogs, and is targeted by M. Emmet Walsh for just existing. These things just happen for Navin! There is no hidden pretenses about 'The Jerk', it simply doesn't try to tell a convincing story, or disguise its zaniness. Everything is intentionally stupid! Problem is, it's very annoying, and far too reliant on Martin's comic ability alone where most of the scenes or situations end up being unfunny. There are two good scenes in my opinion. The first is with Martin beating up a bunch of racist goons, and the other is when Navin is complaining to the waiter about snails. The rest of the humor is downright annoying, particularly because Steve Martin's character is over-the-top zany, stupid, and just unlikeable really. The surrounding characters don't really do much either. Bernadette Peters plays Navin's love interest, and Jackie Mason plays the Petrol Station owner where a few extended scenes take place. I was more intrigued by the fact that Jackie Mason had a distinctive voice, which was the same voice as Krusty the Clown's father, Rabbi Krustofski in The Simpsons, rather than his character in 'The Jerk'. His character barely served a purpose, and Jackie Mason added nothing to the movie, whereas Peters only added a little more.The humor is slightly dated in 'The Jerk' and it's just not very funny at all. Reiner's choice of shots and his direction is not very good, and his later films with Steve Martin are much better. Even though the humour is dated, I think 'The Jerk' still lacked the visual gags, witty banter, and humorous unexpected situations that made other comedies of that time so successful in my eyes, and I don't know whether its because of Martin's character himself or the direction of the movie that made it weak. It just failed to be funny. Most of the time in 'The Jerk', the joke was predictable and then milked till groaning ensued. Not a classic, not vintage or an excellent Steve Martin comedy.

Even though the humour is dated, I think 'The Jerk' still lacked the visual gags, witty banter, and humorous unexpected situations that made other comedies of that time so successful in my eyes, and I don't know whether its because of Martin's character himself or the direction of the movie that made it weak. It just failed to be funny. Most of the time in 'The Jerk', the joke was predictable and then milked till groaning ensued. Not a classic, not vintage or an excellent Steve Martin comedy. Not even a good Steve Martin comedy. See some of his other 80s stuff. 'The Jerk' is a bad film!*½ out of *****!

If Sam is unfit to raise his child because his IQ is that of a seven year old's, how, I wonder, did he raise her in her early years? The story starts around Lucy's seventh birthday, but little is shown how good a father Sam was up until then; all we see is him shopping for diapers and playing with her on the swings. How were his parenting skills during these formative years? Wasn't Social Services concerned for her well-being even once before?The lack of backstory isn't the biggest reason for my dislike of the film. What frustrated me the most is that it raises valid questions about what makes a good parent only to negate them by forcing a compromised resolution before an upbeat ending. Every point the opposing attorney raised is true (in the real world, anyway). A man of Sam's intelligence is not capable of providing for his child, but the movie bends over backwards trying to disprove this fact. The movie's tagline summarizes this lie Love is all you need. Sorry, but love is NOT all it takes to raise a child, and anyone who thinks otherwise is naive and unfit for parenthood.Now that I've got my major gripes out of the way, let's move on to the minor ones. First, Sam makes only $8.00 an hour after working at least seven years at the same place? Since he was unable to cover the cost of his daughter's new shoes, I wonder where he got the money for that inflated air trampoline for her birthday party. And I wonder how he fit it into his apartment. And while I'm thinking about Sam's sources of income, I'm still confused about his other job - dog walking. Walking dogs for extra money I get; what I don't understand why he takes these dogs home with him. Whose dogs are these? Did Sam just forget to return them to their owners, or is he sitting while they're out of town?And Sam's places of business weren't just a coffee shop and pizza place. They were Starbucks and Pizza Hut. Sam and Lucy went shoe shopping not at a mom-and-pop place, but at Payless. They don't eat at diners, but at IHOP and Bob's Big Boy. I Am Sam has the most intrusive, blatant and unnecessary product placement I've seen recently outside a pro sports stadium, and they fit uneasily with the all the covered Beatles songs. Why were the Beatles so upset when Michael Jackson licensed their Revolution to Nike while this movie sometimes looks like one long commercial? Speaking of the sneaker conglomerate, there was even a huge Nike shoe on the side of a bus in the movie for absolutely no reason. I'm surprised there was no mention of Blockbuster with all the talk of movies here. (Maybe because the average Blockbuster doesn't stock KRAMER VS. KRAMER and GONE WITH THE WIND?) I AM SAM has the homogenized feel of a cold corporate environment, and the lighting and camera work exacerbate this lack of warmth.Why were so many scenes lit with a blue filter? Disparate locales - a supermarket, elementary school, lawyer's home and Department of Social Services all had the same sickly azure tint. Was this for artistic reasons? To show how unfriendly these places were? If so, how and why are they unfriendly? Looking at cinematographer Elliot Davis' credits reveals he's a competent veteran (and he lit the also-bad-but-in-a-different-way FORCES OF NATURE similarly), so I guess I'm just missing the point.I'm willing to give director Jessie Nelson a pass for all the unsteady handheld camerawork here. This technique has a purpose and is effective when used correctly, but I AM SAM is only Nelson's second feature, so maybe one day she'll learn why it's a distraction in a quiet domestic drama.I AM SAM is not completely terrible. All the actors do their best with what they're given. I especially liked Doug Hutchison as one of Sam's circle of differently-abled friends, and little Dakota Fanning is a naturally gifted child actor. Dianne Wiest, as the homebody neighbor, is her usual excellent self despite her aforementioned sketchy role. And, as the leads, Sean Penn and Michelle Pfeiffer need no confirmation of their talents.How convenient, by the way, that Sam's neighbor is a recluse who can hear a baby crying in the next building over. What was her story, anyway? The whole movie I kept waiting for this character to be fleshed out, but her testimony at the hearing added little to her character. A 2+ hour drama should make the effort to develop its supporting characters more.What about those moments of greatness, you ask. One scene springs to mind. Actually, make that half a scene, in which the Pfeiffer character peers through the paper wall Sam erected following the custody loss. Wonderfully shot, written and acted, it was the only moment I can now recall that had real dramatic and artistic strength. Unfortunately, this scene devolved into soap opera emoting and uncomfortably close to an ensuing love scene that thankfully never happened. Whew. I was dreading any sort of romantic connection between these two characters, which would have been wrong in so many ways.So, as a whole, I AM SAM is maddingly unsatisfying up to and including the end. About 90 minutes in I thought to myself there's no way it can have a happy ending without either ignoring everything that came before or totally copping out with some kind of half-assed compromise. Sure enough, the final scenes left me dumbfounded. There's not much to say without spoiling it, so allow me just to detest it. Like LOSING ISAIAH (another child custody drama), it ends with of those exasperating solutions that really wouldn't solve the problem in the real world, but lets both sides of a movie court battle come off as winners. And after this insufficient denouement, the movie ends with Sam refereeing Lucy's soccer match. When did Sam become qualified to do this? And wouldn't the ref being a player's father make him unfairly biased? I don't think an officiator should be cheering for a player to score, nor do I think the kids on the other team would be too happy, either. But why let logic get in the way of a happy ending?3\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 October 2003","score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":"  I AM SAM is one of the most unfairly manipulative movies I've seen, which is all the more frustrating because a moment or two of real greatness would become clear between the times I was questioning how wrongheaded, false and\/or blind it is to reality.Let's start with the most obvious complaint - a plothole the movie chooses to completely ignore.

Walking dogs for extra money I get; what I don't understand why he takes these dogs home with him. Whose dogs are these? Did Sam just forget to return them to their owners, or is he sitting while they're out of town?And Sam's places of business weren't just a coffee shop and pizza place. They were Starbucks and Pizza Hut. Sam and Lucy went shoe shopping not at a mom-and-pop place, but at Payless. They don't eat at diners, but at IHOP and Bob's Big Boy. I Am Sam has the most intrusive, blatant and unnecessary product placement I've seen recently outside a pro sports stadium, and they fit uneasily with the all the covered Beatles songs. Why were the Beatles so upset when Michael Jackson licensed their Revolution to Nike while this movie sometimes looks like one long commercial? Speaking of the sneaker conglomerate, there was even a huge Nike shoe on the side of a bus in the movie for absolutely no reason. I'm surprised there was no mention of Blockbuster with all the talk of movies here. (Maybe because the average Blockbuster doesn't stock KRAMER VS. KRAMER and GONE WITH THE WIND?) I AM SAM has the homogenized feel of a cold corporate environment, and the lighting and camera work exacerbate this lack of warmth.Why were so many scenes lit with a blue filter? Disparate locales - a supermarket, elementary school, lawyer's home and Department of Social Services all had the same sickly azure tint. Was this for artistic reasons? To show how unfriendly these places were? If so, how and why are they unfriendly? Looking at cinematographer Elliot Davis' credits reveals he's a competent veteran (and he lit the also-bad-but-in-a-different-way FORCES OF NATURE similarly), so I guess I'm just missing the point.I'm willing to give director Jessie Nelson a pass for all the unsteady handheld camerawork here. This technique has a purpose and is effective when used correctly, but I AM SAM is only Nelson's second feature, so maybe one day she'll learn why it's a distraction in a quiet domestic drama.I AM SAM is not completely terrible. All the actors do their best with what they're given. I especially liked Doug Hutchison as one of Sam's circle of differently-abled friends, and little Dakota Fanning is a naturally gifted child actor. Dianne Wiest, as the homebody neighbor, is her usual excellent self despite her aforementioned sketchy role. And, as the leads, Sean Penn and Michelle Pfeiffer need no confirmation of their talents.How convenient, by the way, that Sam's neighbor is a recluse who can hear a baby crying in the next building over. What was her story, anyway? The whole movie I kept waiting for this character to be fleshed out, but her testimony at the hearing added little to her character. A 2+ hour drama should make the effort to develop its supporting characters more.What about those moments of greatness, you ask. One scene springs to mind. Actually, make that half a scene, in which the Pfeiffer character peers through the paper wall Sam erected following the custody loss. Wonderfully shot, written and acted, it was the only moment I can now recall that had real dramatic and artistic strength. Unfortunately, this scene devolved into soap opera emoting and uncomfortably close to an ensuing love scene that thankfully never happened. Whew. I was dreading any sort of romantic connection between these two characters, which would have been wrong in so many ways.So, as a whole, I AM SAM is maddingly unsatisfying up to and including the end. About 90 minutes in I thought to myself there's no way it can have a happy ending without either ignoring everything that came before or totally copping out with some kind of half-assed compromise. Sure enough, the final scenes left me dumbfounded. There's not much to say without spoiling it, so allow me just to detest it. Like LOSING ISAIAH (another child custody drama), it ends with of those exasperating solutions that really wouldn't solve the problem in the real world, but lets both sides of a movie court battle come off as winners. And after this insufficient denouement, the movie ends with Sam refereeing Lucy's soccer match. When did Sam become qualified to do this? And wouldn't the ref being a player's father make him unfairly biased? I don't think an officiator should be cheering for a player to score, nor do I think the kids on the other team would be too happy, either. But why let logic get in the way of a happy ending?3\/10 ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"14 October 2003","score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":"  I AM SAM is one of the most unfairly manipulative movies I've seen, which is all the more frustrating because a moment or two of real greatness would become clear between the times I was questioning how wrongheaded, false and\/or blind it is to reality.Let's start with the most obvious complaint - a plothole the movie chooses to completely ignore. If Sam is unfit to raise his child because his IQ is that of a seven year old's, how, I wonder, did he raise her in her early years? The story starts around Lucy's seventh birthday, but little is shown how good a father Sam was up until then; all we see is him shopping for diapers and playing with her on the swings. How were his parenting skills during these formative years? Wasn't Social Services concerned for her well-being even once before?The lack of backstory isn't the biggest reason for my dislike of the film. What frustrated me the most is that it raises valid questions about what makes a good parent only to negate them by forcing a compromised resolution before an upbeat ending. Every point the opposing attorney raised is true (in the real world, anyway). A man of Sam's intelligence is not capable of providing for his child, but the movie bends over backwards trying to disprove this fact. The movie's tagline summarizes this lie Love is all you need. Sorry, but love is NOT all it takes to raise a child, and anyone who thinks otherwise is naive and unfit for parenthood.Now that I've got my major gripes out of the way, let's move on to the minor ones. First, Sam makes only $8.00 an hour after working at least seven years at the same place? Since he was unable to cover the cost of his daughter's new shoes, I wonder where he got the money for that inflated air trampoline for her birthday party. And I wonder how he fit it into his apartment. And while I'm thinking about Sam's sources of income, I'm still confused about his other job - dog walking.
