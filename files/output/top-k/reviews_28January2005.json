[{"date":"28 January 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Shrek has some spoofs in it from different movies & fairy tales, which makes it hilarious to watch. It's also got well-known actors playing the characters. Shrek (Mike Myers) is a reclusive ogre who just wants to live life alone - can't blame him, since people & other creatures tend to be really hard on judging him, when not trying to kill the poor guy. But when he runs into a talking Donkey (Eddie Murphey), who's escaped the evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) who plans to remove all fairy-tale creatures from the kingdom of Duloc, he's stuck with a chatty neighbor, for at least 24 hours. But the other fairy-tale creatures aren't as lucky - they're forced out of Duloc & wind up in Shrek's precious swamp! Again w\/Donkey, who knows the way to Duloc, Shrek ventures out to have Farquaad remove the squatters. At the same time, short, cowardly Farquaad has decided to wed Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) to become king, but is choosing another knight to deal with her dragon keeper instead of him. After Shrek shows up, beats the knights (the champion was to be his killer), & becomes popular w\/the people, he strikes a deal w\/Farquaad he'll rescue the princess if he'll get the creatures out of the swamp. He & Donkey pull off an unusual battle w\/the dragon, free the princess, & begin to return to Duloc. On the way, Shrek & Fiona begin to fall in love, but he's too afraid of his feelings to admit it, even to himself. Can Fiona's beauty & Donkey's encouragement make him show himself? This has a good lesson to it, but it's almost hidden in the comic scenes & wild adventure. Every1 should love this.

I can't say that I hated it, but to claim that I actually liked it, even slightly, would be a lie of epic proportions. The music was pretty good, and the jokes... well, they weren't all intolerably stupid and tasteless... I guess. The film is about a talentless(in my opinion at least, those poems were the most uninspired bull I've heard for quite some time) poet who falls in love with a butcher, only to find out that she might be an ax murderer. Yes, seriously. Personally, I thought the twist was obvious from, well, pretty much the beginning. It didn't really come as a surprise. I don't know if that's because I've watched too many movies for my own good or it's because the writer and\/or director just didn't bother with making it a mystery to the viewer. The plot is lame, stupid and not particularly involving. The pacing is very bad; the film seems to move at a pace that would make a handicapped infant snail cringe. Yes, it's really that slow. Trust me. The 'romance' scenes just made the whole thing worse. The acting is nothing special. The characters are poorly written, flat and clichéd. The gags and jokes are rarely ever funny, and every single point is shouted directly into both ears of the viewer, in what is apparently a desperate attempt at trying to make us laugh, which just makes it even more pathetic when they fall flat. I don't know, I just didn't see any humor in the horrid poetry, the main characters' family of moronic misfits who anyone, no matter how forgiving, would be ashamed to admit they were the kids of, or even the wannabe cop who made every single mistake he could when trying to do any actual police work. Maybe I'm too mature, maybe it's just not my brand of humor, maybe I should stop guessing. Some may enjoy this movie, but I'm not sure who. I recommend it to fans of Mike Myers, as they might find it funny; just keep your expectations low. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 January 2005","score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Being a bit of a fan of the Austin Powers flicks, and after having very much enjoyed several other films by Mike Myers(among them, both Shrek films), I decided to check this out as it was on TV.
