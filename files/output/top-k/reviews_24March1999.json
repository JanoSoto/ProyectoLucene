They truly engulf themselves in the character, avoiding the typical unreal characters written into the script. Speaking of the script, it is amazing. I have unfortunately been unable to locate a copy of it... But after my ninth watching I began to feel it more and more. The dialogue is well written, and the scenes are well played out. The photography for this film is also amazing. The first shot alone left me in awe.

He struts his way down the street to Bee Gees tunes and behaves like Disco Stu from The Simpsons. He's got a little con going on after working hours in which he delivers clandestine packages to some rich guy (a weak Anthony Heald) for big tips. He needs escapism and the mystery of the con makes him feel like a spy. Until that is, when Max is framed for murder and has to run for his life.While trying to intercept the last in the series of suspicious packages (located in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest) in order to clear his name, Max is mistaken for a world famous Scout Leader and has to lead a bunch of adventure-hungry kids into the wilderness and shake off the pursuing FBI.Daniel Stern's physical comedy is just plain hilarious and his comic timing is perfect. For anyone who liked him in Home Alone 1 and 2 you'll love him in this also. The kids are surprisingly not that annoying. Usually I hate kids in movies (Jurassic Park, Hook, The awful Von Trapp children) but they had enough character and laughs among them to make it okay.I only ever had a problem with the ending. It was just too tame for a PG-13 rated movie. Instead of Gordy's far-fetched fall into the ravine I would have preferred that the entire balcony of the cabin to collapse and the bad guy fall to his death. Plus the bad guy is kind of weak, his accent is just plain odd and he has this strange sort of campness and not scariness about him. Too bad since Anthony Heald has played some true scumbags in his time.These 2 complains aside Bushwhacked is great adventure movie with a lively score by Bill Conti (why is there no soundtrack CD?). It's probably best enjoyed in Spring\/Summer and is perfect for the whole family. An admirable amount of laughs indeed.The DVD is a godsend for anyone who had to suffer the terrible pan-and-scan video (like me), which half the picture missing. Now Bushwhacked is presented in full 2.351 anamorphic widescreen and it looks just fine. The sound is simple Dolby 2.0 but it's more than adequate. Extras are thin, consisting of just a Bushwhacked trailer (quite good) and couple of other Fox family movie trailers.But for the price, Bushwhacked is a must, regardless of extras or not.

However, I got my money's worth by far!What worked the most for me in the this movie was the degree of sincerity and intelligence portrayed in the script.  This wasn't a typical blood 'n guts gore film about some girl who gets her feelings hurt and knocks off the entire student body.  There's much more beneath the surface than that.I would dearly love to see this movie again while it's still playing on the big screen.  There's something different about this movie which is a cut above many of the recent teen-scream movies which have come out over the past 2 years.  I'm not sure what it is.   It might be truer-to-life characterisations, or terrific performance by newcomer Emily Bergl, or the well-written story which unfolds at the perfect pace, and sets you up for the (somewhat) typical finale.  I think it's most likely the empathy you feel for Rachel, and the sadness which prevails.  And where true love is concerned, like Romeo & Juliet, true lovers can only be together forever in death.  That is the definitive nature of happy endings, as illustrated early on in this film.This movie - however - does not end this way.The Rage is rated R for mild language, brief sexuality, and - naturally - horror violence and gore.

Just having come off of viewing it, I feel as though I've been through the tear wringer. I was literally swept away not only by some of the most unique and creative visuals I've ever seen in a film, but by the whole concept that was carrying it. That being the refreshingly independent idea that we in effect can create the shapes, colors and tone of our own afterlife. It's an idea that first took seed in my mind after seeing Angelheart, but the message was far more subtle and still seemingly tethered to a religious predisposition. I've never seen this idea fleshed out more clearly and poetically in a motion picture, personally. And for that I'll give it a great deal of credit.At the same time however I felt that it was that same overly romantic tone that played a part in its biggest weakness. Like its main character, it just didn't know when to put its feet on the ground, and show us a little more of reality minus the interjections of a schmaltzy, manipulative score. During the first fifteen minutes of the film I felt as if I was watching a string of AT & T commercials, and quite frankly it put me off a bit. On the same token, the very end seemed a bit forced too.Admittedly, the sentimental scenes did do their work on me, and I gave in to the emotion while at the same time keeping my brain cells mobile. I truly have no problem with crying in a movie, my only problem was in the overly romantic and sometimes forced *way* that my emotions felt provoked. That was the distraction.So save for that, an overall recommendation. Great concept, stunning visuals, convincing cast and most importantly, it challenges conventionality and makes you *think*.

The concept keeps you engaged for about five minutes, then you rapidly lose interest (the opening sequence would play very well as a short film, it's gruesome in an amusing way - unfortunately this sense of humor is not evident at all in the remainder of the concept).The dialogue and the characters are astonishingly bland.
