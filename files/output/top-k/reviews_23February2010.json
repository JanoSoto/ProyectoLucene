Later on, the cheap look to those movies created a fan base, and a trend. So, the same way today some guys (myself included) shoot super8 because they want the grain, the look, and the process now useless in the video age, so did (and still do!) many filmmakers seek to do b series style, because they loved the old ones, wanted passionately to do a film, and didn't have enough money to do one.I saw this Braindead, back to back with the brilliant Re-animator. Together, these two films, plus the festival mood in the theater where i saw them gave me one of the funniest nights in cinema ever.

It was all really great, memorable. So, i supposed the spirit of the makers of the films was fully transposed to the audience in that room, me included. it means both films work.Now, it's interesting to think about a few things this film is a self-aware b series, meaning that who did it knew they were deliberately making a cheap looking, b themed movie. This was in 1992, so they were making it to audiences by than unaccustomed to the cheapness that was tolerable when, say, Corman, was making his films, or even more when Ed Wood was.

Instead it is a yeah, let's make something that looks phony, fake, and ketchup, people will laugh with us.

Back in 1967 when I was ten years old, Doctor Dolittle was all over the place. Toys, dolls, games and posters were everywhere, and the radio and TV variety shows were full of Sammy Davis Jr. singing If I Could Talk to the Animals. Even with all of this, Doctor Dolittle seemed just the kind of family entertainment that I tended to avoid. Now, more than 40 years later, I've finally got around to seeing the film, but I'm no closer to knowing if I would have liked it any better at age ten.The problem with the film seems to be one of mistaken premises. Studios looked at The Sound of Music, Mary Poppins and My Fair Lady and tried to duplicate their success, but they seemed to have paid attention to all the wrong things.The adaptation of a popular children's book (like Mary Poppins) was a good idea, but rather than attempt to recreate the rather dumpy doctor described in the books (Mary Poppings David Tomlinson would have been great, but he lacked marquee value, likewise Dolittles, circus-owner, Richard Attenborough would have made a great Dolittle&#x85;certainly a livelier one) they opted for the stiff and starchy Rex Harrison. The actor's lack of warmth may have fit the character's unease with humans, but his clear disinterest in anyone else in the film comes across as merely distant and bored. The apathetic Harrison doesn't even try to make Dolittle even a little bit different from My Fair Ladys Professor Higgins. Coming across solidly as a misanthrope, he fails also to demonstrate any real rapport with the menagerie of animals on display.The charmless Harrison was greatly helped by the winning softness of Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady. Here Harrison has zero chemistry with Anthony Newly (whom it's reported he disliked for being Jewish) nor the requisite veddy-British female love interest, Samantha Eggar who is not only waaaay to young for him, but, despite her stunning looks, adds absolutely nothing to the film because she seems even more distracted and bored than Harrison. Lastly, there is a mush-mouthed little boy thrown in for no apparent reason (William Dix) beyond giving Newly someone remotely human to give plot exposition to.The songs from Mary Poppins and, to a somewhat lesser extent, The Sound of Music had the quality of being witty and smart while having a sing-song, nursery-rhyme quality that made it easy for kids to remember and want to sing along. The undistinguished collection of songs in Doctor Dolittle sound more like they were written with hopes of becoming standards or Oscar contenders than on being anything that kids might find fun to listen to.From beginning to end Doctor Dolittle is a clumsy musical almost on par with Lost Horizon in its inability to entertain on even the simplest levels. I think fans of Rex Harrison may like the movie, for it is what he does film after film, and it is a pretty good showcase for the phenomenon that was Anthony Newly (an oddly fascinating actor\/singer whose unconventional looks and singing style could only have made it in the 60s), but Doctor Dolittle is dreary when it should be cheerful, lumbering when it should be light-hearted, and long-long-long. If the filmmakers were less cynical about tapping into the The Sound of Music money-making zeitgeist and more concerned with actually making a fun children's classic, there's no telling how much could have been done musically with the Doctor Dolittle books.

Beatty always comes across as if he's trying to teach us something; or do something noble. He also comes across as somewhat self-serving. Personally, I think of him as one of the most over-rated people in Hollywood history. For more than half its run time, I would certainly put Bonnie & Clyde into both the over- rated and dull categories, although by the time it ends, it has overcome that second flaw, anyway. There are hints of a character study throughout - Clyde Barrow's apparent impotence (at least as implied in the film) is hinted at as a reason for his general frustration with life. Bonnie strikes me as just a young woman bored with life in a small town, looking for excitement. To me, the first half of the movie had a general sense of silliness to it, and concerns itself with some Bonnie & Clyde legends rather than with the facts. On the other hand, the second half of the movie is pretty good. There are several good shoot-out scenes, leading up to the climactic ambush by the police. To give credit, Beatty was pretty good as Clyde, and Faye Dunaway did a good job as Bonnie. Gene Hackman was decent in a supporting role as Clyde's brother Buck.There's no history lesson here.

Even if the money was on deposit with the bank, though, whose money would they have been stealing?The stronger second half made me feel better about watching this, and it's not Beatty's worst movie by a long shot - high praise from someone like me who frankly doesn't care much for the man's work. 4\/10 ","genre":"Biography, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"23 February 2010","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" A university professor seeks to help a mathematical genius who has had problems with the law and on his release, Will Hunting (Damon) must agree to see a psychologist.Opening with a colourful slow moving montage of a long haired Matt Damon scribbling maths equations on his mirror, we are instantly engaged into a strong psychological drama that will make you laugh, cry and be enticed into a world of intelligence.This splendid picture, almost 13 years old now, has lost none of its relevance in real world story telling.

Masterson is the best actor of the movie's trio, and though her mannerisms often bring to mind a twitchy Sandy Dennis, nothing compares to the girl's close-ups. HOT!

It contains heavy elements of both and plays them equally well. --James Berardinelli.Indeed, few films are as wildly entertaining as True Lies. It's the definitive film of the action-comedy genre. Most films that contain both, sacrifice one at the expense of the other. For example, Die Hard had a few good one-liners, but it's main purpose was to send the viewer for one hell of a roller coaster ride. These days, the PG-13 rating is king, so it's the former; action is lessened and neutered and in it's place are jokes and gags. Those can be fun, but James Cameron has pulled out all the stops for his unrecognized masterpiece, True Lies.Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwartzenegger) is a boring computer salesmen, or at least that's what his wife thinks. The truth, however, is the complete opposite. Harry is a secret agent working for the US Government, doing what Arnold does best blowing away countless bad guys in the most outlandish way possible. But his two lives are about to collide it turns out that his time spent saving the world is leaving his wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) alone and bored. To add a little spice to her life, she's getting involved with another secret agent named Simon (Bill Paxton). Also in the mix is a creepy terrorist named Salaam Abu Aziz (Art Malik) and a gorgeous historian\/art collector\/businesswoman named Juno Skinner (Tia Careere).Movies don't get much more fun than this. The action sequences are thrilling (in a very fun sense) and the comedy is laugh-aloud funny. The film never takes itself too seriously, but it also doesn't become campy. If anything, finding this correct balance is True Lies' greatest success.No one is going to associate Arnold Schwartzenegger with the term classical actor, but this is easily his most accomplished performance. Schwartzenegger has a lot more to do than to shoot down terrorist and make things go boom, and surprisingly, the muscleman is able to hit all the notes. Harry loves his wife, but sometimes his job gets in the way of him showing it (the film has a great one-liner about this, by the way). Likewise, Jamie Lee Curtis became forever known as The Scream Queen after duking it out with Michael Myers twice in late seventies and early eighties. Here, she's not only given a chance to show her comedic talents, but also her dramatic chops. Tom Arnold is great as the divorce-ridden sidekick, who despite his failures in marriage, is on hand to provide Harry with some support about how to show Helen some affection. Bill Paxton is suitably obnoxious as Simon; only a woman as desperate and frustrated as Helen could possibly take anything he says seriously, and that's why he succeeds.The villains equal the heroes, however. Art Malik is suitably psychotic as the lead terrorist, and uses his eyes to great effect. Tia Careere hasn't had much of a career before or since, and I have yet to figure out why. For one thing, she's gorgeous, and she's also talented. She's terrific as the seductive other woman, and her dance sequence with Schwartzenegger in their first scene together is priceless (it's also somewhat erotic, although it's got nothing compared to the scene in Titanic where Leonardo DiCaprio draws Kate Winslet's nude portrait).Jerry Bruckheimer may be the uber-producer of summer action movies, but when it comes to film-making, James Cameron is king. This guy can do it all, and he knows just what to do with the material. He's open to taking chances, and he knows what the audience really wants. One of the best things about this movie is that it doesn't insult the average movie goers intelligence.

Tom Arnold is great as the divorce-ridden sidekick, who despite his failures in marriage, is on hand to provide Harry with some support about how to show Helen some affection.

Art Malik is suitably psychotic as the lead terrorist, and uses his eyes to great effect. Tia Careere hasn't had much of a career before or since, and I have yet to figure out why. For one thing, she's gorgeous, and she's also talented. She's terrific as the seductive other woman, and her dance sequence with Schwartzenegger in their first scene together is priceless (it's also somewhat erotic, although it's got nothing compared to the scene in Titanic where Leonardo DiCaprio draws Kate Winslet's nude portrait).Jerry Bruckheimer may be the uber-producer of summer action movies, but when it comes to film-making, James Cameron is king.

It wasn't intentional, it wasn't because of personal grudges; the opportunity simply never presented itself any sooner! Well, that's certainly something I regret now, damned! If I had discovered this film ten years ago, for example, it would have been a personal favorite ten years ago already and I would undoubtedly have re-watched it numerous times and introduced it to many friends by now. Oh well, it's never too late for that. Clue is fantastic entertainment, with an ultimately ingenious basic premise (the first film ever to be based on a board game), copious amounts of hilarious dialogs & one-liners, stellar performances from ideally cast actors and actresses and a uniquely structured narrative with no less than three different endings. Who doesn't know the game of Cluedo (Clue in America)? In case you grew up in an era where portable video games and similar rubbish hadn't been invented yet, chances are high that you played this game at one point during your childhood and\/or adolescence. I know for a fact that it saved me from numerous otherwise boring afternoons with distant relatives and the offspring of my parents' friends. The set-up of the game is utterly simple who committed the murder, in what room of the house and by using which murder weapon? There are multiple potential murderers, each hiding behind a suspicious facade and a color pseudonym, a large house full of rooms and secret passageways and a wide variety of murderers. Naturally there has to be a bit more background and introduction in a long-feature movie, but writers Jonathan Lynn (in his debut) and all-around genius John Landis (American Werewolf in London) came up with a pretty tight and clever wraparound story. Six mystery guests, all living and\/or working in Washington D.C, are lured to the secluded Hill House for a night of humiliating revelations and unexpected confrontations. They're all being blackmailed by one and the same person, but when that person is lying dead on the library floor after a moment of lights-out, they suddenly all become murder suspects. Together with the peculiar house personnel, like the hyperactive butler Wadsworth and the voluptuous French maid Yvette, they try to unmask the culprit (but mostly clear their own names) before the police arrives. Instead of finding the killer, more bodies start to pile up Clue is a genuinely hilarious comedy AND a truly compelling murder- mystery at the same time. How seldom do run into one of those? The film is funny without having to revert to vulgarity or black humor. The script is funny in an old-fashioned way, through cunning one-liners and subtle little details in the set-pieces. The film is also dazzlingly fast-paced and literally chock-full of obvious tributes to classic horror films (like House on Haunted Hill), classic whodunit (Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians) and classic fellow parodies (Murder by Death). All cast members give away tremendous performances and it's simply impossible to pick out any favorites. Tim Curry is sublime as the eloquent butler, Madeline Kahn is stupendous as the frigid widow, etc, etc. This is definitely a brand new personal favorite of mine, and I hope to recommend it to many more fans of original and creative cult cinema.

It wasn't intentional, it wasn't because of personal grudges; the opportunity simply never presented itself any sooner! Well, that's certainly something I regret now, damned! If I had discovered this film ten years ago, for example, it would have been a personal favorite ten years ago already and I would undoubtedly have re-watched it numerous times and introduced it to many friends by now. Oh well, it's never too late for that. Clue is fantastic entertainment, with an ultimately ingenious basic premise (the first film ever to be based on a board game), copious amounts of hilarious dialogs & one-liners, stellar performances from ideally cast actors and actresses and a uniquely structured narrative with no less than three different endings. Who doesn't know the game of Cluedo (Clue in America)? In case you grew up in an era where portable video games and similar rubbish hadn't been invented yet, chances are high that you played this game at one point during your childhood and\/or adolescence. I know for a fact that it saved me from numerous otherwise boring afternoons with distant relatives and the offspring of my parents' friends. The set-up of the game is utterly simple who committed the murder, in what room of the house and by using which murder weapon? There are multiple potential murderers, each hiding behind a suspicious facade and a color pseudonym, a large house full of rooms and secret passageways and a wide variety of murderers. Naturally there has to be a bit more background and introduction in a long-feature movie, but writers Jonathan Lynn (in his debut) and all-around genius John Landis (American Werewolf in London) came up with a pretty tight and clever wraparound story.

Therefor I can judge this movie only by its entertainment value and not by its historical accuracy. Ever since The Godfather and Apocalypse Now I've been a big Coppola fan. I like the fact that - like Martin Scorcese - he keeps looking for visual experiments. Remember the mirror scene in Peggy Sue Got Married? That was never done before. Or the way time was used in Rumble Fish. The staging of One from the heart. Original and daring. In Tucker Coppola goes to visual extremes. The whole movie looks like a big commercial for Tucker himself - and it all works great. The story - an honest underdog must fight against the system - reminds us of the works of Frank Capra. The always brilliant Jeff Bridges is a very (or maybe too) likable hero. In the beginning he's maybe a little bit too unreal until you see how he reacts when he finds real trouble on his way. Then he becomes more human. But the real drama in this movie comes from Martin Landau. His scene in which he confesses that he caught Tucker's dreams is a moving one. The way he gets accepted into Tucker's family is so natural. Besides Landau I liked almost all the cast. Frederic Forrest, Mako, Joan Allen, Christian Slater, Lloyd Bridges&#x85; their roles aren't earthmoving, but work very well in the whole picture. Tucker's meeting with Howard Hughes (Dean Stockwell) is pure magic.Together with The Godfather part I and II, Rumble Fish and Apocalypse Now I consider Tucker A man and his dream to be Coppola's best work.

All at the same time with him pulling off the cheeky character of Alex that's telling a story of a young criminals journey of madness .Another notable performance is that of Michael Bates, Whose role as the prison Capitan brings in a quirky and comedic feeling in a somewhat dim setting.For me personally the use of music in this film is what helps bring it a notch above the rest. Its classical music approach is perfect for the film and suits the settings and characters better than any other film does. My favorite being The Funeral of Queen Mary, by Wendy Carlos which epitomizes the film to a degree of perfection.This film is one of the most important and special films of the 20th century.

I liked the fact that the only things I knew about this, was the cover with Mariah covered with, well, glitter and that it was (obviously) about a singer. I had never seen a preview, read a review or knew anything about the plot. So despite everyone's opinion &#x96; since 2001, I came in with a clean slate. And that was refreshing.No, the movie wasn't refreshing; it was deafening. I was referring to the open-mind going in.Billie (Mariah Carey) is a star born from her alcoholic mother on stage. Not shy at all, the little Billie sings her heart out. A star is born? Not so fast; we need some foreshadowing to mother falling asleep with a cigarette in tow nearly killing both mother and daughter. Off the daughter goes to foster care. She meets two friends&#x85;Man, I'm bored just recapping this melodramatic, Lifetime reject.Let's just skip to the rest of the ho-hum parts. She grows, dances for an early 1980's crowd, insert drama, gets discovered by two men, both of which use her, more drama here, and she rises to the top, ensuring even more drama.I can't say I hated this movie. It just wasn't good at all. Namely for the absolutely no-talent (in acting) Carey. Sure, she has a voice, but only a mother would love&#x85;to hear exclusively on the radio. I have never, ever in my movie-going experience seen so many fake smiles or so little emotion. Poor Billie (the character) as Carey has played her so&#x85;plain&#x85;that, quite frankly, I can't see anyone wanting to, or caring if either the character or actress succeeded or not. I knew she would, duh, the movie was as predictable as a Presidential race, but I found how little interest I had in watching her mope her way to the top.Have I failed to mention the incredibly idiotic, bargain-bin music video cinematography and the endless aerial NYC shots? How about the other thoroughly uninteresting stereotypes around her? Well, to sum that last part up, think of every single actor in this film and they fit that bill. I just felt embarrassed for them.Did Carey do this for a self-promotion? Did she think her smile was enough? (Oh, and by the way, she's not pretty. I'll just be mean for a second; she's not attractive nor were those HIDEOUS clothes.) I can barely see a three year old smile her way to warming another person's soul, much less than this wannabe actress do it &#x96; what, 87 times in this film? Did anyone watch these scenes while shot or bother to screen the film before it severely flopped at the box office? Seriously, how can one human being sit alone in an isolated screening room, watch this movie from beginning to end and say, Yep, we done have gold fer this Glitter! Make billions, we sure darn will! (Please tell me they fired this person, or better yet, let them drive one of the recalled Toyotas around Mulholland Dr. In a rainstorm. At 3AM. Without headlights. Having a seatbelt-less Carey in the passenger seat.) Though it now ranks in my own personal list of worst movies, I wouldn't put it at the top. It's just so incredibly boring, has so little emotion, that whenever a special Lifetime moment occurs, I could honestly care less what happened to who. If you can find the drunk 5-min Carey clip online when she accepts an award for her superior performance in 2009's Precious, it's more entertaining than the entire 104 minutes of Glitter.Ah heck, here is the link http\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=sleaSKmd5Js. If this link is broken in the future, then a quick Google search Drunk Carey Award should do the trick. Save yourself the 99 minutes, and watch this instead. You'll get a heck of a lot of more emotion from her in real life than her so-called acting.
