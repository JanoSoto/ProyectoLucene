I knew that they had avoided reviewer screenings, and understood the implications of that studio decision.  I had seen the original series and while I liked it, I did not consider myself a huge fan. Unlike some I know, I had no problems seeing Uma Thurman as Emma Peel.However, nobody I know who saw The Avengers was prepared for how BAD it was. Despite what looks on paper like an excellent cast of quality actors, they lacked almost any on screen chemistry and not even their combined talents could rescue this dismal film.Instead of the witty banter the director strived for, what we end up with is endless prattle.  Both Thurman and Fiennes appear to be just going through the motions.  In fact, Fiennes' (who I consider an excellent actor) John Steed is so understated and stiff that he might as well have been replaced with a cardboard cut-out with a pair of moving lips.  Sean Connery can't even save this turkey, seeming confused and bored on screen.The only thing that might have saved the film was the cinematography.  The Avengers is filled with eye candy and stirring images, but not even the camera work and set decoration in the film can save it.  The opening theme was well done, but then disappears, leaving us with the rest of the score, which was simply disappointing.Debates have raged between those of us who weren't lucky enough to avoid this film over what the worst aspect of it was.

This is just the opening 60 seconds of the already timeless 'D-Day scene.'  No words are spoken in the opening minute but the images and sounds portrayed make up for that in a heartbeat.  I was already moved, but the first minute only slightly prepares the viewer for the impending landing on Omaha Beach.  The scenes which follow last around 25 minutes but may haunt thousands of people's minds for years.  The realism which Spielberg brings to the Normandy assault is staggering and profoundly disturbing.  The ocean was red with the blood of young soldiers that morning and Spielberg will make us remember it. This opening scene alone is worthy of study and countless accolades.  In fact the opening D-Day scene is the most heart wrenching and realistic combat scene ever captured on film.  The Normandy scenes could be newsreels from the actual time if they were B\/W.
