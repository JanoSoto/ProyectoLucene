[{"date":"24 October 2000","score":"","review":"  Max Fischer has so many extracurricular activities there little time left for studying. He writes plays about Vietnam. His friends are a loyal eleven year old aide and a forty-five year old millionaire who drives Bentley. This comedy is so off-beat you just have to love it. It's an ode to nerds, about a young boy who feels grown up and about a grown man wanting to be young again. Aside from being very on-point, it's also hilariously funny. It's great looking at the world through the eyes of a fifteen year old with all the problems of a grown man. Great work by Jason Schwartzman.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"24 October 2000","score":"","review":"  \tWriter\/director Christopher Guest takes a look at the relationship between Man and that most loyal of beasts, the dog, in `Best In Show,' a humorous satire presented in the same `mock documentary' style as Rob Reiner's `This Is Spinal Tap.'  It's a keen observation of human nature, as it is much more about the owners and handlers than about the dogs themselves, and much as David Byrne did with `True Stories,' Guest presents a diverse community united by a single, common thread, that being their love for their dogs, and aspirations of winning the blue ribbon in the upcoming competition that will go to the top dog overall, the Best In Show.  Through a series of interviews and memorable scenes, we are introduced to the owners and their beloved canines who will soon square off in the arena at the world class Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia.  We get to know a bit about each of the participants, so we know just who they are and where they come from.  Guest has assembled a terrific ensemble cast, who bring it all to life by creating a rich tapestry of characters culled from a true cross section of Americana  Good ol' boy Harlan Pepper (Guest), with his Bloodhound, `Hubert', from Pine Nut, North Carolina; a somewhat neurotic young couple from Illinois, Meg and Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock), members of the `Starbucks' set with their Weimaraner, `Beatrice;' Gerry and Cookie Fleck (Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara), a couple who could be anybody's next door neighbors, with their Norwich Terrier, `Winky', from Fern City, Florida;  Leslie and Sheri Ann Ward Cabot (Patrick Cranshaw and Jennifer Coolidge) a wealthy couple who have a Standard Poodle, `Rhapsody In White', entrusted to the care of professional handler Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch); and finally, another couple, Scott Donlan and Stefan Vanderhoof (John Michael Higgins and Michael McKean), with their precious Shih Tzus, `Miss Agnes.' \tThis is a highly entertaining, funny movie, filled with wry, subtle humor that is delivered straight and never played for laughs, which makes it believable and real, and all the more hilarious.  This is quite a group of characters, eclectic to say the least, and they're all real people.  You're bound to run into someone you know among them.  The dialogue is sharp, and rife with dry wit.  And for anyone who's ever watched any kind of sporting event on television, you'll appreciate the parody of the so-called `color commentator,' in this case a guy named Buck Laughlin (Fred Willard), that is dead on the money.  His comments during an interview to a nonplused Dr. Millbank (Bob Balaban) about Columbus landing at Plymouth Rock will have you on the floor.  There is so much here you can relate to, and it's all done in such good fun.   \tRounding out the outstanding supporting cast are Don Lake (Graham Chissolm), Jim Piddock (Trevor Beckwith), Ed Begley, Jr. (Hotel manager), Linda Kash (Fay Berman), Larry Miller (Max Berman) and Don S. Davis (Best In Show Judge).  The performances here are good all around, with especially notable turns by O'Hara, Levy, Guest, Lynch and Willard.  Written by Guest and Levy, `Best In Show' works so well because it holds up a mirror and reflects the lives we all lead in one way or another.  As we watch, we realize that even as we are laughing at all of these characters and situations, at the same time we're laughing at ourselves as well; because there's more than a little bit of each one of us in there somewhere.  And it reminds us that when things seem to be getting too serious, it's time to pick up that mirror and take a good look; and thanks to the frame of reference that a movie like this provides, you just may find something to laugh about, and be able to discover the `Best In Show' in your own life.  I rate this one 9\/10.              \t   \t        ","genre":null},{"date":"24 October 2000","score":"","review":"  \tWriter\/director Christopher Guest takes a look at the relationship between Man and that most loyal of beasts, the dog, in `Best In Show,' a humorous satire presented in the same `mock documentary' style as Rob Reiner's `This Is Spinal Tap.'
