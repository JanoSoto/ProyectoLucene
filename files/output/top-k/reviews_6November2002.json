Film has many subplots but mainly focuses on Preston (Embry), a boy who has always had a crush on popular student Amanda (Hewitt) but kept it a secret throughout their schooling. He feels that the loud and raunchy house party is the perfect setting to confess his feelings. Comparable to many other youth oriented films which leads to a lack of originality for this film but it still manages to be enjoyable.
