In the original, the affectionately known star Elenor jumps over not twenty, not ten cars, but one car.

Considering BULLITT was made the previous decade, the 45-minute car-chase was not the most exhilarating sequence ever shot.Perhaps the problem was the fact that the films heroes are no-good criminal punks. But, modern Hollywood logic has a way around every problem. The good guys are good to their mothers, and the bad guys are British.Brits make great villains. Thesps like Rickman, Irons and Branagh sneer their way - in vain - towards defeating holier-than-thou yankee heroes. The good guys get the witty lines, the bad guys die a painful death, and it's been that way since the dawn of time.Now comes GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS, and it's Christopher Eccleston's turn to ham it up. The difference here is that the dialogue does not discriminate. This is equal opportunity embarrassment three Oscar winners and a talented supporting cast looking foolish as anything.Delroy Lindo gets the lions share of the clangers (`I should arrest you&#133;but I understand brotherly love', `I know him&#133;he fears that car'), and compared to his idiot cop partner, he's the brains of the force. Angelina Jolie is a typically slight romantic interest. Eccleston is supposed to be a villain fearsome beyond comprehension. This is off-set by his bizarre wood-fetish, and an assessment of baseball (`it's so bloody boring') that would make the worlds worst stand-up comic cringe. Robert Duvall, the finest actor in the film, is reduced to putting lines through stolen cars on a blackboard - that's it.Now I realise that the characters are hardly a fundamental concern in a Bruckheimer picture. But from a critical perspective, it's hardly worthwhile reviewing any aspect of them. The action set-pieces are as spectacular as always. While the big car chase is only half as long as the set-piece in the original film, it is a definite crowd-pleaser.  While there's a strangely long time between thrills, the tempo never drops. Writer Scott Rosenberg can take credit for this. His script is so insubstantial and cliched it never lingers on any plot detail long enough to become a pressing concern.Perhaps it was intentional the dialogue is so bad. Perhaps it's a joke at the expense of the stars track records (except for Cage, not averse to setting his sights so low).

The story, with its climax on the Statue of Liberty, is, admittedly, a bit comic book-y, but - do I really need to say this? - it IS based on the Marvel comics. However, the movie captures the comics' tone perfectly, and has its tongue-just-far-enough-in-cheek to acknowledge the absurdity of the situation without giving in to camp. Perhaps most refreshing is the movie allowing itself to spend the first hour getting to know each of the X-Men (and their counterparts, The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants) -- their personalities as well as their powers. The movie's central theme - growing up feeling different - plays out amongst the heroes Professor X as a father figure to the X-Men, Wolverine as a big brother to Rogue, Cyclops as the son trying to make Professor X proud, etc. This new family manages to gel enough to challenge the evil mutants' plans at the end, with the fireworks and fisticuffs you'll expect. Some of these scenes suffer because of a (relatively) low budget and a studio which rushed a movie to summer that was supposed to come out at Christmastime (or perhaps, X-Mas?). Once Fox counts up all the profits from this movie, I would hope they would spend enough on X-Men 2 to replace some of the unconvincing wire work seen here with those do-anything CGI effects. Another smart move would be to replace Michael Kamen (whose last project was conducting an orchestra with Metallica) with pretty much anyone else, and giving that person time enough to write a decent score. With 30-odd years of X-Men history, there are plenty of additions and subtractions that could be made to the cast of the sequel. However, each charactor in X-Men merits a return, in smaller or larger ways. The most important ingredient is obviously Singer, who has a firm grasp on just how to translate that long history to film, and how to do it with style.

Wouldn't be a reference to a certain Mr. Duchovny by any chance? Other than the everyday, run-of-the-mill execution, the other problem I had was with the scariness of the movie. A fantastic trailer was shown on television, showing people leaping out of their seats, hurling popcorn everywhere. As a bit of an idiot, I had planned to see the film with friends and do this whether I found it scary or not, just to act the fool. As it turned out, two other people in the cinema meant we couldn't justify making idiots of ourselves to such a small audience, and was there really any time when such a reaction would be appropriate? Honestly, I didn't even jump once. Wes Craven and his silly Scream has got a lot to answer for...

And while it sounds good on paper, it actually compounds the problem of a lack of strong women, especially since she is made out as Horatio's girlfriend  Suddenly, Marcella (as she is now called) has no purpose.  As a man, he was in maybe two scenes, and after Horatio is established as Hamlet's only confidant, he ceases to matter.  Now, however, she repeatedly appears in scenes where she has nothing to do except stand dumbly by her man; because her character does not appear in the script (and because the filmmakers never came up with a justifiable reason for keeping her) she still doesn't matter.  Only now we are painfully aware that she doesn't matter, because we continue to see her. This sort of careless revision that ultimately sacrifices story and character (two of Shakespeare's strong points) for gimmick does much to contribute to the downfall of the movie.While I fully support a naturalization of Shakespeare's words in the mouths of modern actors, much of the cast simply mumbled what's left of the text without ever embodying the rich meaning behind the words.  Case in point Ethan Hawke's best delivery of his dialogue comes when he is forced to raise his voice to be heard over the dance music in a club.  The rest of the time he's pretty much content to murmur to himself without ever actually letting us inside his head.  Julia Stiles' Ophelia isn't much better off when it comes to projecting real emotion (big problem for almost everyone), but she is at least partially redeemed by her quite brilliant mad scenes. I think this is actually the best handling of those scenes it has ever been my privilege to witness, especially her reunion with brother Laertes (Liev Schreiber, on his game yet again).  And despite an exasperatingly pause-heavy delivery, Bill Murray actually manages more genuine warmth is his handling of Shakespeare's language than most of the leads.Aside from that, the most interesting scene in this modern adaptation of Shakespeare's play, both for its clever updating of the text and its cool factor was the chase after the ghost of Hamlet Sr. through the back stairways, complicated elevator systems, and up to the roof of the Hotel Elsinore.  Unfortunately, it never happened.  It was set up just right Horatio, Marcella, and security guard Bernardo are anxiously awaiting the young prince's arrival upon the platform where they watch (an empty hall of fancy elevators) while they look for signs of the ghost's activity on their security monitors, when Bernardo calls Hamlet on the phone and wakes him. But he never gets him on the phone  the ghost in this version is considerate enough to come right to Hamlet's room without having to separate him from his comrades (although Sam Shepard does give an engaging performance as the elder Hamlet).But Shakespeare was smarter than that.  Again, the filmmakers have tried to justify their tampering with the script by introducing new gimmicks, but I wonder how they expect a surprising tweaking of the text can ultimately make up for the excitement of human interaction upon the platform of which we have been deprived.  (The end sequence suffers most heavily from this careless cleverness.)  In fact, in spite of the reasonably skillful butchering of the text, the movie moves along at a surprisingly dull pace. What the recent Romeo and Juliet may have lacked in acting skill, it made up for in spectacle, thereby assuring a satisfying ride.  This Hamlet never quite makes it.  The music, for example, although annoyingly incessant, rarely helps to push the action, as it did very well in, say, Lola Rennt (Run Lola Run).  If you make the choice to disregard the unbroken rhythm of Shakespeare's text, you'd better be prepared to offer us something else that moves the action along just as efficiently, which these moviemakers have unfortunately failed to do.Nor is there any attempt made to cash in on the significant humor of the script; even Bill Murray's Polonius rarely comes off as funny, and we are cruelly teased with -and then robbed of- the gravedigger scene.  Indeed, the only laughs when I saw it came just as the King was revealing his crafty grand plan (ho hum) to the enraged Laertes, and only then because a boom microphone was momentarily seen hanging over their heads as the camera angle changed!The movie is not a total loss.  It has its share of clever ideas and nice moments (from Polonius tying his rebellious daughter's shoe, to Ophelia's early contemplation of suicide) and scores high points with its updates of Ophelia's handing out of flowers, and Hamlet's carefully crafted video he calls The Mousetrap.  It also has a handful of strong performances, although with such a disappointing Hamlet, no one could have saved the movie.

Braveheart was well deserving of the best picture award, along with Contact it is one of the best films of the decade. I give it five stars, and would highly recommend it to everyone who enjoys epic adventure.

So disco balls didn't lower out of the ceilings during the fight scenes.  Is that how little you wanted?  Outdo BATMAN & ROBIN and everyone falls in love with you.  Well, what kind of accomplishment is that?All they had to do was stay true to the source material, do some competent casting, and load it down with FX.  But no.  They decide to fail in each one of those categories.SOURCE MATERIAL - Xavier has to introduce Sabertooth to Wolverine.  Enough said.CASTING - Halle Barry as Storm?  She's like a child playing dress-up. Cyclops looks trendy.  Jean is old enough to be everyone's mother.  Magneto looks too old to go to the bathroom himself, let alone threaten the world. And Wolverine?  Contrary to what EVERYONE keeps on SAYING, he is NOT Wolverine.  Not even CLOSE!  Just what are you all on?  Hugh Jackman is taller than Cyclops, and way too skinny.  And Singer decided to trade his log cabin feel for a Harley\/trucker feel.FX - Did you see any?  If there's one thing you would've thought you could count on from Hollywood, it's FX, but not here.  Nor is there any good stunt-work, choreography, or anything.  The action SUCKS.  It looks like it was all done by ameteurs.  Where the hell did all of the budget go? Probably into things like Halle Barry and her three lines, or the 3-D morphing map.  Money well spent, all right.Oh, there is so much more to complain about...Magneto doesn't have a costume, because Singer wanted him to be more down-to-earth, so he gives him a LAIR instead.  Oh, but no Dr. Evil is complete without his obligatory invention of doom.  Tell me, why did Magneto need such a plot device as the mutation-triggering machine?  Isn't his magnetism itself the plot device?  Oh, but that's not enough, I guess.  So, instead of just showing Magneto kicking ass, they take the money they could've spent on his electro-magnetic sphere and put it towards lame-ass white radiation.  Other casualties of this stupid plot device include half the running time of the movie, Senator Kelly, and oh yeah - any hint of respectability.The thing that gets to me the most is, I think I hate this movie more because I can picture watching it from a non-fan point of view.

So disco balls didn't lower out of the ceilings during the fight scenes.  Is that how little you wanted?  Outdo BATMAN & ROBIN and everyone falls in love with you.  Well, what kind of accomplishment is that?All they had to do was stay true to the source material, do some competent casting, and load it down with FX.  But no.  They decide to fail in each one of those categories.SOURCE MATERIAL - Xavier has to introduce Sabertooth to Wolverine.  Enough said.CASTING - Halle Barry as Storm?  She's like a child playing dress-up. Cyclops looks trendy.  Jean is old enough to be everyone's mother.  Magneto looks too old to go to the bathroom himself, let alone threaten the world. And Wolverine?  Contrary to what EVERYONE keeps on SAYING, he is NOT Wolverine.  Not even CLOSE!  Just what are you all on?  Hugh Jackman is taller than Cyclops, and way too skinny.  And Singer decided to trade his log cabin feel for a Harley\/trucker feel.FX - Did you see any?  If there's one thing you would've thought you could count on from Hollywood, it's FX, but not here.  Nor is there any good stunt-work, choreography, or anything.  The action SUCKS.  It looks like it was all done by ameteurs.  Where the hell did all of the budget go? Probably into things like Halle Barry and her three lines, or the 3-D morphing map.  Money well spent, all right.Oh, there is so much more to complain about...Magneto doesn't have a costume, because Singer wanted him to be more down-to-earth, so he gives him a LAIR instead.  Oh, but no Dr. Evil is complete without his obligatory invention of doom.  Tell me, why did Magneto need such a plot device as the mutation-triggering machine?  Isn't his magnetism itself the plot device?  Oh, but that's not enough, I guess.  So, instead of just showing Magneto kicking ass, they take the money they could've spent on his electro-magnetic sphere and put it towards lame-ass white radiation.  Other casualties of this stupid plot device include half the running time of the movie, Senator Kelly, and oh yeah - any hint of respectability.The thing that gets to me the most is, I think I hate this movie more because I can picture watching it from a non-fan point of view.

A cameraman runs out into the street soon after Godzilla shows up in New York and STANDS THERE as Godzilla's foot crushes a taxi cab parked right in front of him. The strangely unmasculine hero of the picture with the Greek last name nobody can pronounce, along with the Frenchmen, just STAND THERE in the bowels of Madison Square Garden as Godzilla's eggs start hatching all around them. Having characters standing there in the middle of imminent danger does not build suspense; it makes the characters look stupid.2) The hero of this picture is - well, somewhat less of a hero than we usually expect to find in an action picture. Let's face it, Matthew Broderick is not an action star. He actually looks a little ungainly in the shots showing him running from the Godzilla hatchlings. Imagine Bruce Willis in the role and you'll have an idea of what kind of excitement is missing here. Nevertheless, the movie has Broderick spending the final third of the film running around. And unfortunately, he isn't running around trying to be proactive, setting up traps and thinking on his feet (if he were, that all by itself would have made this movie much more enjoyable). No, instead he spends lots of screen time being chased and calling on the military for help. You might ask, This guy is Mr. Everyman. What else could this guy do? -- to which I would reply, Why have as the hero of what is supposed to be a high- octane action picture a guy who can't do very much about the problem that the movie presents, other than calling in the military?3) Various inconsistencies. Other posters have listed a few of them, but the one that really annoyed me was the difference between the initial dogfight with Godzilla and the scenes in which our heroes are fleeing Godzilla in a taxi cab. How is it that Apache helicopters have a hard time keeping up with Godzilla, but the taxi cab (surely a much slower vehicle) manages for long minutes at a time always to stay inches ahead of Godzilla? Has Godzilla gotten tired by that point in the movie? After the helicopter-attack sequence, the fleeing-taxi-cab sequence feels like a cheat to keep the suspense going. So my answer to the people here who genuinely liked this movie and keep pointing out that the movie is supposed to be a roller-coaster ride, not Shakespeare in Love, is that the movie doesn't quite work even as a roller-coaster ride -- for reasons that include those I've just listed.
