With fine performances throughout the good guys in this, The Last Crusade is truly one that is a well played out one, and also very funny. Does it match up to Raiders, well we will have to see as I write this review but be safe in the knowing this is thoroughly entertaining stuff. Harrison Ford is of course the man donning the whip and fedora again and is off on yet another quest, but this time it is his father he needs. In this film we are introduced to Indiana's father, Henry Jones Sr, who to Indiana's annoyance always calls him Junior. Sean Connery is the actor stepping into the boots of Jones Sr and he makes a fantastic addition to the series, I'd even go as far to say he is the best new character in the series since well, Indiana Jones. As for rest of the cast it is Julian Glover who I wasn't so keen on, I wasn't sure if it was the poor accent or just the circumstances that happen but I just felt he was a little stale. Denholm Elliot as Dr Marcus Brody returns, this time he is maybe not in it as much as he could have been but is still a welcome return and an addition to a cast full of personality. Spielberg I feel is not at his absolute finest here, his direction can feel a little sticky at times, not that it is bad but just not as good as say Raiders. It is written fairly well, the script not maybe blowing me away in the more serious moments or even parts where it is downright ridiculous, but the comedy styling that is put upon Connery and Ford is one of the up most brilliance. It is that partnership between them that is one of the most immortalising things about this movie, the addition of Connery's character instantly makes this better and the workmanship between him and Harrison Ford is one that for me makes them two one of the best film duos's of all time.The effects are ramped up for this one, of course years had passed since the last two and the movie really knows how to utilize new found techniques. It is the explosions that for me are just better, this film is bigger than past seen, much more action means much more effects and it is great to see them used properly(and not overused either). Staying on the technical side of things the cinematography by Douglas Slocombe is still as ever marvellous, he just seems to know how to film an action adventure movie, never makes it boring angles, always quick but swift shots.So, is this addition in the Indian Jones movie collection the best? well that is a tough question. Raiders of the Lost Ark I know is a movie people find a special one, a movie that many consider their all time favourite, of any movie period. For me although I did watch Raiders and found it really good, I think the Last Crusade is too and deserves a place like Raiders in the heart of film fans, I don't think the Last Crusade is anything special that saying, but is still a highly entertaining piece of cinema and one I feel will endure for years to come.So overall the film is great, a movie I would recommend to anyone really as it contains a bit of everything, action, adventure but most importantly for me, it has laughter, this for me I can be sure of, is the funniest of the series. Sean Connery is the stand out performer in my opinion, maybe he even deserved awards for what he did here, and the chemistry here between father and son is one of great fun and great humour.

I am not saying your opinion is wrong or anything. Just this movie wasn't meant for me. Secondly, I heard of this movie in a review and was turned off by the movie for a while. Then, I watched it with a willingness to accept that I might like this film. Sadly, the movie just made me dislike it. First, I will talk about what I like. The costumes and sets are incredible to see. The color explodes and the designs are very unique. I think the guy who plays Christian (sorry, I forgot his name!) did a great job acting. The singing was also decent. Now for the things I don't like, which, sadly, is a lot. The script felt shallow for me. For example, why is Christian obsessed with love? Sure, his father scoffs at the idea of it, but what else? He is obsessed with the idea before he even falls in love. I wish I could know more about him. Also, the movie describes love as something good...I think. It didn't really give me a new point of view of what love is. The love story in this movie is formulaic and doesn't allow love to be analyzed. Also, I'm just not a fan of love at first sight. But that is just a preference.Another preference that I dislike in this movie is the music. I actually like the original songs this musical plays, but I'm not a fan of jukebox musicals. I hate it more when the music does not fit with the time period. It sucks me out of the time period and brings me to the present and away from the movie. Music is a big part of the experience for me. If the music does not fit the movie well or time period (if it is set in a time period), then I get distracted and start noticing the mistakes in the movie.Finally, I will conclude on my thoughts on the editing and the rest of the acting. The editing is too fast and the wide angle lens is annoying. I know its supposed to be stylistic, but it distracts from the amazing costumes and sets. It jumps around too much. Now, for the acting. It is too over-the-top for my taste. Again, you could say that it is for the style of the movie, but it gets annoying after a while. Sure, there are some slow parts and some subtle acting, but those moments are taken for granted and we don't learn much about the characters besides basic characteristics.

At first the four are having a great time but after witnessing a murder they become the hunted by a mutant.Tobe Hooper's THE FUNHOUSE was released at a time when slashers were taking over the genre and if you look at the poster you'd think that this was going to be another but it's actually not. I think the film had a pretty negative reputation for quite sometime because people were going in expecting something that what they actually got. Technically speaking this is an extremely well-made film that manages to build up a rather nice atmosphere and it certainly has some interesting stuff going for it but there are still some flaws that keep it from being a good picture.It's interesting that Hooper would go for a scare picture even though that's not what people were really wanting in 1981. The film manages to have some very good moments thanks in large part to Hooper giving it a very interesting atmosphere. You can certainly feel the carnival atmosphere as you watch the picture and the screenplay certainly gives us a lot of character development for the four leads. Another good thing the film has going for it is the cinematography and music score. Both of them perfectly capture the shocks of what the film has to offer. For the most part the performances are also good with Elizabeth Berridge making for a good lead and we get some nice support from Sylvia Miles and William Finley.The film has its issues as I said and this includes the fact that nothing really happens until after the hour mark. I'm sure Hooper and company were wanting to build up the atmosphere as they did but I think they should have thrown in some sort of killing to keep people caught up in what's going on. Also, logically, you have to wonder about really being trapped in such a small space. This here is what really keeps the film from being better but there's still a lot to enjoy here.

So naturally a sequel was to be made to capitalize on the success. What followed was a worthy sequel that was also a success. Die Hard 2 is a bigger movie than it's predecessor. But bigger isn't always better, it lacks some of the suspense that made the original great. While the original took it's time to introduce the characters and set them up before the action begins, this movie jumps into the action very early on. That isn't a bad thing since we know most of the characters already and probably want to see McClane kill bad guys. This movie is very similar to the first Die Hard; John McClane goes somewhere for his wife, terrorists take over, wife becomes a hostage, and John McClane has to stop them. In this movie John McClane is back with his wife, in the original they recently had an argument. You wanted them to get back together, because you wanted John McClane to succeed.

John McClane has more one liners making this funnier than the original. I said it isn't as intense as the original (it does have a couple of intense scenes though), I stand by that but this is just as fun if not more fun to watch.A lot of old characters return such as Holly, Al Powell, and Richard Thornburg.

As the guy who wants to help the hostages, but disagrees with McClane's methods and actively dislikes him.The new villain Colonel Stuart (William Saddler) is a good villain that is completely without morals and would kill anyone to get his way. Him and his team take control of the airport and hold the planes hostage. He's not as good as Alan Rickman, but he plays his role well. One of the reason's he isn't as good as Hans Gruber is because he and McClane don't have much conversations. By that I mean in the original McClane and Hans had multiple conversations through the radio and argued with each other and teased each other which gave them a good rivalry that was fun to watch. That happens around once or twice in this film. However he is probably the only villain that can fight McClane head on. All the others are more leaders and not soldiers, so if they were to fight McClane they'd lose. But Colonel Stuart does fight McClane at the end for a good and intense fight at the finale on the plane.

The Women can be seen with pleasure. It's not totally boring. Nevertheless, it is very long and has too many dialogue. The viewer can get tired. But worst of all is the chauvinism present in the film. The director, George Cukor, is a man who I appreciate a lot. I'm not a fan of any of his films that I've seen, but I like some as My Fair Lady and The Filadelphia Story. The Women was the film I liked most of Cukor, but it is not at all his best work. Why? Because of the chauvinism. Cukor is a wise man. I like to hear him. He is homosexual and their women, in the movies, have friendly personalities (Katherine Hepburn is wonderful in The Filadelphia Story). But the women in the film in question are catty, talk cheap, poisonous and futile. There are women like so, in fact. The stereotype is not a lie but it is a very big generalization. Of course there are friendly women in the movie, as Norma Shearer, Joan Fontaine and Paulette Goddard's characters. But most of the women don't behave in a good way. As if stereotypes weren't enough, the film shows that a woman can not be happy without her husband. I would like to see Mary (Norma) without Stephen in the end and happy with her divorce.Rosalind Russell is the best. Fun despite venomous. I know she is very stereotypical but she is very funny. Joan Fontaine is pretty bad. I like this actress, although I think she is not versatile. In Rebecca, Suspicion and Letter from an Unknown Woman, Joan does the same role. And in The Women too. Joan does a good job in the other films but, in The Women, she is very weak as an actress. Paulette Goddard is fine and beautiful. Rosalind and Paulette are the best for me. Mary Boland is also quite good.Norma and Joan Crawford are well, but not fascinated. Crawford has a very ordinary role but it shows that she is a versatile actress. She can play the victim (Mildred Pierce) and the poisonous woman (The Women).With The Women, you can see how things have not changed much. The soap operas continue to represent the same way these stories of betrayals and some of the stereotypes.

For example John McClane is separated from his wife putting him down on his luck again. He got suspended from the NYPD and starts the film off hung-over. So bottom line he doesn't start off very happy.This time instead of being in a single small area, he's in NYC. The setting always gets bigger. A new villain emerges; Simon (Jeremy Irons), who is setting off bombs around NYC. He threatens with more explosions unless John plays Simon Says (get it). However John McClane isn't the guy in wrong place at the wrong time, as Simon specifically asks for McClane to play Simon says. Instead the guy in the wrong place at the wrong time is Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson). He saves McClane from one of Simon's games that gets ugly quickly and gets stuck having to join McClane on the game of Simon Says to protect NYC from Simon's explosives.One of the best things of the movie is McClane and Zeus' relationship. It is highly entertaining. They argue, they complain, curse, and help each other. McClane also has more conversations with the villain than Die Hard 2. Since they are always talking to Simon for him to give them their next mission, they'll usually have some good exchanges. Die Hard with a Vengeance adds the tradition that all future Die Hard films need to give McClane a sidekick. Zeus is probably the best sidekick McClane gets.Simon seems like a Bond villain. He comes up with a lot of overly complicated ways to kill McClane and enjoys toying with him instead of killing him. Since a lot of bad guys have the chance to kill the hero but don't kill them in a lot of movies (like Karl from the first one) it does give an excuse as to why Simon doesn't kill McClane when he has the chance.The acting is still good, the action as always is fun, the film has a couple of chuckles here and there, and some great suspenseful scenes. But one thing that just didn't stick well with me was the ending. It just felt out of place and tacked on in the end. From what I read, it sounded like they had a couple of problems on how to end it so I'm not surprised this ending felt rushed.

This situation is exacerbated when she has her first period whilst showering at school. Out of the blue, Carrie discovers that she has telekinetic powers and is intent on using these powers to get revenge on those that are bullying her.For me, Stephen King adaptations have always been a bit hit and miss and interestingly Carrie falls somewhere in the middle. Like other King adaptations such as Christine and Cujo, Carrie essentially is one long build up to the eventual crux of the story which takes place at the prom. Unfortunately, if you're going to set the story up in this way then you need to make sure that there are two key ingredients; a really strong pay-off or an involving story between point A and point B and again Carrie only partly succeeds in both areas...What lets this film down slightly is that for the bulk of its running time it doesn't really explore Carrie's telekinesis particularly well. The majority of the run time seems to be spent on all the pretty people discussing the prom night. The side characters are rather bland and for me got a little too much focus. Thankfully some scenes are very effective throughout the middle of the film (most notably the scenes between Carrie and her mother - wonderfully portrayed by Piper Laurie). Whilst watching this film, it's very easy to feel for Carrie as a person as she not only has to deal with a gang of bullies at school, but she then goes home to her barmy mother who is some kind of religious nut. In some ways, I felt Carrie deliberately ostracised herself from everyone else for fear of bringing friends home. Reading between the lines, I suspect that there was definitely something of a 'daughter doesn't need any friends other than her mother' scenario with Carrie and her mother.The moment where Carrie starts to unleash hell at the prom is very good and this is mostly down to Spacek looking so damn creepy. The problem again is that the build up to this moment was far too drawn out. I'm all for suspenseful build ups, but if you leave it too long you're in danger of losing your audience. I kept thinking to myself 'Oh just bloody get on with it'. The film ends quite strongly, but again is it good enough to make up for its shortcomings? Yeah I'd say it just about does enough to make it worthwhile.As far as performances go then many may see Spacek as the star of the show and yes she was very good, but for me it was Piper Laurie that was the best thing about this film. She was a joy to watch here and her character did genuinely unnerve me slightly. Some of the other characters are rather bland particularly Travolta who shows his face a couple of times and collects his pay cheque.Carrie is a passable and watchable film, but it's very uneven and whilst it's effective at times, many scenes that don't focus on Carrie and\/or her mother are quite tedious. It's certainly not bad, but a classic? I don't think so.

Unfortunately, if you're going to set the story up in this way then you need to make sure that there are two key ingredients; a really strong pay-off or an involving story between point A and point B and again Carrie only partly succeeds in both areas...What lets this film down slightly is that for the bulk of its running time it doesn't really explore Carrie's telekinesis particularly well. The majority of the run time seems to be spent on all the pretty people discussing the prom night. The side characters are rather bland and for me got a little too much focus. Thankfully some scenes are very effective throughout the middle of the film (most notably the scenes between Carrie and her mother - wonderfully portrayed by Piper Laurie). Whilst watching this film, it's very easy to feel for Carrie as a person as she not only has to deal with a gang of bullies at school, but she then goes home to her barmy mother who is some kind of religious nut. In some ways, I felt Carrie deliberately ostracised herself from everyone else for fear of bringing friends home. Reading between the lines, I suspect that there was definitely something of a 'daughter doesn't need any friends other than her mother' scenario with Carrie and her mother.The moment where Carrie starts to unleash hell at the prom is very good and this is mostly down to Spacek looking so damn creepy. The problem again is that the build up to this moment was far too drawn out. I'm all for suspenseful build ups, but if you leave it too long you're in danger of losing your audience. I kept thinking to myself 'Oh just bloody get on with it'. The film ends quite strongly, but again is it good enough to make up for its shortcomings? Yeah I'd say it just about does enough to make it worthwhile.As far as performances go then many may see Spacek as the star of the show and yes she was very good, but for me it was Piper Laurie that was the best thing about this film. She was a joy to watch here and her character did genuinely unnerve me slightly. Some of the other characters are rather bland particularly Travolta who shows his face a couple of times and collects his pay cheque.Carrie is a passable and watchable film, but it's very uneven and whilst it's effective at times, many scenes that don't focus on Carrie and\/or her mother are quite tedious. It's certainly not bad, but a classic? I don't think so.

Her character has truly exceeded any character that Charles Dickens or William Shakespeare ever created. Goldberg literally sold her character and when she graced the screen with her performance, people were just dying to see her such a dynamic performance and who could blame them.With the 1980's coming to a close, we has the honours to reflect what a decade it has been in the era of film-making. Some of the great creative minds emerged from this occasion. It was a time when thinking and direction was compatible. There was very few lazy remakes or CGI green screen dependency. It was originality and creativity all the way. There was no competition to see how much money you make in one day. Artists like Robert Greenwald was creating artful flicks like Xanadu and Ridley Scott was making original modern-day fairy tales like Legend, no one expected that the 1990's would come along with a plethora of bummer films. It was like the creativity was lost. The colourful and the spontaneous dynamics were badly watered down with blandness and half-baked films that were only out there. The only film of the 1990's that had the charm that was lost in the 1980's was the 1996 movie Evita. While the 1990's crept up with its grunge, baggy clothes and other societal lowering, the time to have something to embrace on was eagerly anticipating. So while cinema was going on the decline, 1990 did provide a gem that will eternally be etched in the hearts of many because everyone had already figured out this film was going to be special because they were getting tired of the grating films that were hitting the box office this film was selling faster than hotcakes. This was clearly Jerry Zucker's best directed film (no matter what, he never exceeded his expectations). It has everything to offer, great acting, brilliant script, a few chuckles, a few cries, but the score was excellent. I mean I love the oldies and one of the most beautiful ballads is Unchained Melody by The Righteous Brothers. If that song won't have you slow-dancing with a partner. I don't know what will?

What made this film stand out the most was the performance of Whoopi Goldberg as Oda Mae Brown. She sold her character above everyone else, even the late Patrick Swayze (his baby will always be Dirty Dancing), and Demi Moore who's career stalled after the Brat Pack. It was her flair, her charisma that carries the beat of this movie. She truly stands out like no other performer. She truly is a diamond in the rough. Granted Miss Goldberg did win the Best Supporting Actress Oscar that year for her performance as Oda Mae Brown. And the critics around chewed on that notion including me. But their rhetoric is vague and at times not fully justified. But I must go deeper and to assume that Oda Mae Brown was around before we ever knew Whoopi Goldberg in fact Oda and Whoopi are two completely different people. What I'm trying to say is that I'm not a big fan of Whoopi Goldberg (not that I loathe her either) and that this movie and The Colour Purple were the two movies that made Whoopi a household name. I would love to see her make a sequel or even a remake to Ghost. I mean her humanitarian efforts are phenomenal, but her acting is greatly missed.

Although this may directly refer to his unique story and unique suffering in a desperate quest to be noticed as a 'human being,' this may also embody the motives behind liking or disliking this film. The dilemma revolves around 'accepted' or 'not accepted.' As based on the true story of Joseph Merrick (the film changes the name deliberately as the protagonist may represent any man), the storyline develops characters from the standpoint of the protagonist, the victim of his destiny, a pitiful scapegoat of the mob's undying curiosity and a grateful receiver of the open minds around him. John Hurt portrays Merrick is a very subtle way highlighting his suffering, his despair, his little joys and...perhaps the most discussed feature, his courage. Roger Ebert in his rather critical review on the movie quotes an American novelist Wilfrid Sheed who doubts the 'true courage' from Merrick since, what he points out, 'true courage requires a degree of choice. What choice does the protagonist have in these circumstances and what choice does anyone have? Anyone whose condition is totally beyond one's control? As more or less courage a viewer can find in the character though, one thing is certain along with the supporting characters of the movie, we grow perceiving the protagonist more and more as a likable, even lovable human being. I would not agree with Mr Ebert and his statement of 'pure sentimentalism' but rather see certain scenes heartily where, indeed, Merrick's sense of beauty and sense of subtlety emerge. The theater scene is, perhaps, the most important to be quoted here. There is also a religious undertone in him, namely, in the quotation of Psalm 23 which appears as comforting inspiration and 'his cathedral' which occurs to symbolize his quest for spiritual heights.Clearly, the most important character except for the protagonist appears to be Dr Frederick Treves (also a historical figure) played with sheer brilliance and precision by Anthony Hopkins. In all what he does for John Merrick, we see true doctor's charisma. He tells the truth...he is not afraid of a bitter answer 'No' to a desperate question Can you cure me?' Yet, as he portrays a man of good intentions and right deeds, he also powerfully depicts a man of doubt. In one memorable scene with his wife, we encounter Dr Treves asking himself Am I a good man? This modesty of his character makes him memorable and approachable. It is, finally, him who Merric calls his true friend. This certain 'bond' between the patient and his doctor is compared to Francois Truffaut's WILD CHILD by Roger Ebert and, indeed, there are certain parallels that may be drawn. However, there is one prevailing aspect between Merrick and Treves that is confidence from the start.Sir John Gielgud and Anne Bancroft need to be mentioned as supplying the story with charm and heart. Both portraying real figures (Francis Carr Gomm and Ms Kendal), they constitute an 'oasis' of kindness and understanding to Merrick. Ms Kendal, more to say, played delicately by Ms Bancroft, represents 'mother's care.' (consider the camera-frame of the scene when she calls his 'Romeo'). The scene of gift (the dressing case) stands out as an emotional resonance.

Rather, I will concentrate on my impressions while watching this movie for the first time - which I did just the other week.For years, I had been vaguely aware of this film, but I never bothered to check it out. The reason was that I assumed that it was basically a mob movie about a hit-man - a genre I'm not particularly interested in. Which, in once sense, it is. However, it is much more than that, as I discovered when I finally got around to seeing it.When I started watching this movie, at first I found my impressions confirmed, as it opens with an apparently unstoppable mob assassin 'hitting' a group of drug dealing mooks. This opening scene was interesting in that the viewer never sees the killer directly - only in hints. This adds to the sense he's like a shadow or a ghost, an unstoppable force.However, the viewer soon discovers he's very much a human - and a sad, lonely one at that, living a marginal life in a slum with only his plant for company. At the same time, the viewer is introduced to Mathilda, the young neighbor girl who lives next door - who also lives a sad, lonely and miserable life.Soon, the unstoppable assassin saves the young girl from the hit squad of drug-dealing cops- and that's when the movie changes ... from a more typical mob shooter into something very like a (very) dark romantic comedy\/drama. This I was not expecting. I was sort of expecting that the hit man would protect the girl, who would be more of a non-entity - a MacGuffin if you will (a joke they employ in the movie itself - at one point, she registers them in a hotel under the name MacGuffin).As a viewer, I watched the unfolding sexual tension between the girl and the killer with uneasiness and dismay. Which appears to have been exactly the point the film-maker was making. The viewer is kept uneasy, not knowing exactly where this relationship is going - just how transgressive it is going to be ... is Mathilda actually in love with Leon? Is this love returned? Or is Mathilda just manipulating Leon to convince him to help her carry out her revenge? The answer appears to be a bit of yes to all the above - though Leon displays no sexual interest in Mathilda, he clearly grows to love her (in the sense of wanting what is best for her, even above his own self-interest).Mathilda, on her part, is certainly not above lying and manipulation in order to get what she wants. While she expresses her love for him repeatedly, to the point of outright propositioning him for sex, it is pretty clear that this sexual aggressiveness is the result of her abusive upbringing and her desire for adulthood - to her, it would seem, love means sexual love only, as she has never seen any other kind (other than cuddling with her baby brother). She both needs Leon (to carry out her revenge) and loves Leon (the only adult who has ever been kind to her). In that context, her declarations are both an attempt to bind Leon to her, a sort of manipulation, and the only expression of an adult type love she can understand.The point is that this is a surprisingly deep and sensitive exploration of a relationship, and nothing like what one would expect from a typical action movie.
