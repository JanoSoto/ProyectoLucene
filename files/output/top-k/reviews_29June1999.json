The Mummy is an action\/adventure\/comedy in the best tradition of Saturday morning cinema and it does not miss a trick. A dash of horror\/suspense will not have you white nuckled to your seat unless you found the episode in First Contact scary where Picard was chasing Borg through the darkened decks of his ship. This is strictly; tongue in cheek, rip roaring high adventure.Eventually we will become blase about all these special effects especially if they continue to be thrown at us with the abandon present in this movie. I expected that I had seen most of the FX in the trailer but there were lots more.  I expected to see perhaps a dozen undead monsters that were computer (re)generated but there were scores of them and all beautifully realised. I didn't expect to see our hero in a melee with those recently reanimated, wrong again. It's all very clever, I love it and I wonder how long it will be before a whole movie is created in the computer with the actors cut in from simple (and cheap) green room set filming.Another thought occurs to me are all the studios protecting themselves against the new Star Wars film? If Lucas is going to have lots of FX then we ought to too. Let's make our own FX filled movie so we don't get left behind. So we are treated to Matrix one week and Mummy the next soon to be followed by Wild Wild West before The Phantom Menace has a chance to blow our socks off with its own computer wizardry.Regardless of the motive for making this film it is a cracking way to spend a couple of hours in the dark. Go on, spend a fiver, you know you want to. ","genre":null},{"date":"29 June 1999","score":"","review":"  There is a new Indiana Jones and his name is Mr O'Connell.

THIS IS A SMART, FUNNY film. The jokes are flyin' at you, and the script is clever and funny as hell. This is perhaps the Animal House of the 90's. The movie does a great job of showcasing the brilliant young comedians that put the flick together.  Namely, Dave Chapelle, Harland Williams and Jim Breur. Oh yeah, and the Scarface guy is funny too. The double role played by Chapelle is utterly hilarious. Good cameos by Jon Stewart, Janeane Garofalo and Steven Wright also make this movie not wack.  How can you guys not like this movie?

Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins were amazing in this film-the chemistry was right, the acting superb, and their performances worthy of the numerous awards they were nominated for (and won).Anyone who feels that Foster's character was acted weakly was obviously not paying attention. Starling is not only likable, but she's got something real about her-something that you can relate to. Hopkins is devilishly clever and cynical, which makes him all the more appealing. I was already a big Foster and Hopkins fan before this movie, and have been even more so since this film.  This is one of those movies I never get tired of watching-if you have DVD, you've got to check out the Criterion Edition of this...the commentary from the actors is alone worth the slightly higher price.I found the end to be positively chilling (someone else commented on this as well) It's not an elaborate thing, just simple and scary.  I don't remember the name of the actor that played Jame Gumb, but I've seen him in a few other films and can't help but think what a great psychopath he played! Scott Glenn's performance was commendable as well.I just recently read Harris' Hannibal, and I can't wait to see that immortalized on film....Just can't seem to get enough of ol' Hannibal the Cannibal! I am a read the book kind of person, but I must say that the film did the book some justice-they were both equal as skillfully written and entertaining narrative. Jonathan Demme really outdid himself on this one!If you have never seen this movie yet, run, don't walk-and rent it or buy it. You will not be disappointed.  It is positively one of-if not the best-films of the decade.
