I had high expectations for this movie, really high expectations. Ever since I saw the original Star Wars trilogy, I have been dreaming for a sequel(or a prequel, or whatever). I never tough the day would come where I would see proofs that there would be a new Star Wars but I kept hoping for it. One day, I saw the words Episode 1 casting announced on the cover of my Star Wars Insider! It was an incredibly good moment for me. You should have seen entering the movie theatre on May 19, 1999... I was out of control! I came in there believing I would be blown away... I came out of there really, really, really disappointed. God knows I tried to like that movie(I have seen it 4 times!), but every time time I came out of the theater, I felt disappointed. Okay, now lets get to the qualities and problems of this Star Wars. Let's start with the good...First of all it's a Star Wars(although sometimes I ask myself if it really is). The movie is beautiful from a visual point of view. The special effects are great and some action scenes, like the podrace and the Jedi combats, are great. I would even say that some of the characters were okay, like Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. The music is great(thank you, John Williams). Now let's see the problems... Here we go! First thing, let's just say that Jar-Jar Binks is horrible. He is so annoying and every last one of his line is absolutely ridiculous and useless. Some characters were poorly introduced R2-D2, C-3PO, Jar-Jar and... Anakin! This boy is the whole point of the movie and he is poorly introduced! Jake Lloyd really has a terrible character to play and he doesn't help it! Anakin is so annoying as the little boy that wins by accident and luck and never needs to do anything to be the best that most of his scenes are boring, particularly in scenes with his mother. These scenes are absolutely unbelievably fake. Talking about the point of this movie, it almost has none. It's an introduction to universe we already know! It almost feels like a movie for people who have never seen Star Wars!Let me tell you one thing, not many people fall in that category. The plot looks like the one of the weakest episode in the original  trilogy Return of the Jedi. Talking about Return, those stupid Gungans are even worse than the Ewoks!!! 60%, just because it is a Star Wars. See you in line for Episode 2, hoping it will be better!

Let me first say that I really did want to like Magnolia. There is nothing that thrills me more than a film that takes risks and knocks that casual movie viewer out of their box. With Boogie Nights Paul Thomas Anderson showed us his brilliant and eye catching ability to direct a true feature film. It was also a great example of how a soundtrack can truly drive a film and add extreme life. All what I have mentioned of Boogie Nights and rave reviews lead me to undoubtly believe that Anderson pulled it off again. It pains me to say I was disappointed. If you get a chance watch the DVD version of Boogie Nights with the part where Anderson goes over nine deleted scenes and why they were cut out. Do you notice something. It seems to me Mr. Anderson forgot how to skillfully edit a film to give it the effect that's needed. There are too many scenes in Magnolia that go on way too long. The scene where Robards is mumbling on and on, the scene where Melora Walters is screaming at her dad (too many expletives killed this scene), and the scene where Reily and Walters are having coffee. These are all examples of scenes I don't understand why they weren't edited to make them more effectual. And if you're going to say that they were longer to fully show the emotion these people were feeling stop yourself right there. Showing emotion is great but if you sit there and and keep repeating it to hammer it in to your audience eventually you're going to knock them right out of the film.   The audience and myself included already understood what was happening and were ready to move on, something Anderson mentioned quite frequently about why he cut out scenes in Boogie Nights, but Anderson sat there in a scene like we were children. ALL RIGHT WE KNOW JULIANNE IS UPSET CAN WE PLEASE MOVE ON!!! And, their is an overuse of expletives in this movie. I don't mind someone swearing like a sailor just as so it adds power and strength to a scene. Here it got annoying and becomes OVER THE TOP. What happened, what happened? I keep asking myself. As for the climatic ending, which every one has heard about, why didn't any of the characters in the film talk about it. Is it a cute little reference back to the opening sequence? Is that it? I'm supposed to believe that it just happened and that's it you just go on with your life? Come on give me a break. I wasn't looking for Boogie Nights part two. I was looking forward to that same directing style and the shot grabbing ability that thrilled me and made my eyes twinkle with delight. I was also looking forward to a story that would flow with the same drug inducing vigor that makes you unconsciously smile. If you want you can cast me off as someone who just didn't get it.

Before going on any further, I must say that I have no kids, I went with a good friend and we both loved the movie.  It was a continuation of the original; only a few years later.  The characters are older (Andy, sis, and the puppy) and the characters that played a big role in the original are still there (Buzz, Woody, Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Rex, Etch-a-Sketch, Bo Peep,etc)Congrats to Pixar and Disney for a wonderful movie that didn't contain any cursing or sex.  It was a refreshing change that isn't just for kids.  Throughout the movie, there were references to other movies (Star Wars and Jurassic Park) that an older child or an adult will catch.  Plus, there were a couple of scenes that I thought were adult oriented but subtle enough for a child to not understand double meaning.

On December 25, this movie was launched. It was a limited release but two weeks later there was a wider release. If I would have known how good this movie was, I would have watched on Christmas Day. I saw Boogie Nights and I was very impressed, but nothing, and I do mean nothing prepared me for this movie. There are four things that I love in this movie. The first is the prologue, which is very original and clever.The second towards the middle of the movie, is the very interesting idea, when everyone sings. I do not believe that someone did something similar. Probably Aimee Mann (the composer of the songs) felt really special.The third thing is the cast. The performers work together so well and none of them steals scenes, which will be a major problem for the Oscars, because there are no main characters and there are no secondary characters. Everyone is important. Jason Robards, as Earl Partridge, looks entirely believable as a dying man of cancer. His wife, Linda, played by Julianne Moore, is extraordinary as a woman who never loved her husband but now when she sees him in such bad shape, starts to care for him and feels unworthy near him. His male nurse, Phil (played by one of my favourite actors Philip Seymour Hoffman) loves his employer and goes to impossible length to reunite him with his estranged son, Frank. Frank is played by Tom Cruise in one of his best roles ever. He is amazing as a misogynist TV guru, who built his entire life on his hate for his father and who slowly crumbles when a reporter interviews him and then confronted with his father. Philip Baker Hall is wonderful as a TV game show host who is also dying of cancer and his daughter, Claudia (Melora Walters), who hates her father for molesting her. John C. Reilley is very subdued as a lone policeman who falls instantly in love with Claudia. And finally William H. Macy, who is always a pleasure to watch, makes a remarkable approach to his character, Donny, who had been a winner of the aforementioned show thirty years ago. Now he is a pathetic loser who works in a furniture shop and who wants braces to be attractive to an utterly gorgeous male bartender, who by the way wears braces. In the end, Donny is really going to need braces.Finally, I saved the best for last. Remember the ending from Boogie Nights? Were you shocked? Well, I will not reveal anything important, but Magnolia's ending is far better. I felt like being on rollercoaster for the first time when you feel nauseous and sick and breathless. You want to stop but somehow you also want to go on. That's how I felt. I have seen hundreds maybe thousands of movies and this one is not a horror, a thriller or science fiction, which should be able to make me feel like that. I never felt this way while watching another movie. Magnolia is a miracle.I never did this before, but I am profoundly grateful to P.T. Anderson for creating this masterpiece. Thank You!

He has a history of constructing such movies as Stepmom and Mrs. Doubtfire. Bicentennial Man is being misadvertised as a humble family comedy.

Bicentennial Man is a sweet, touching production with lots of heart and a shapely message.\tAt first Bicentennial Man looks  to be about a futuristic family who buys an android robot that is supposed to do housework and serve them. The family of four includes two children, one named Little Miss, and the parents who are called by the name of Sir and Ma'am.

But the reasoning behind the lack of focus on the family is due to the fact that Bicentennial Man isn't about the family who buys Andrew, but a narrative of Andrew himself.\tA running flaw in the film is our foundering curiosity that only grows more ponderous as the script progresses. The audience desires more information about why Andrew is so different from the other robots. There are obvious reasons, sure, but what I wanted was an explanation of why he is special. A lust for information that is never appropriately granted.The film skips ahead a generation or so. Sir and Ma'am age and Little Miss grows to be a full grown woman. Many things change for Andrew. He begins to wonder what lies beyond the likes of his household. He longs for emotional reactions to take place on his face and the concept of freedom. Sir has taught Andrew about death, sex, love, humor, and time. He gradually wants more and more independence. This is where Andrew starts becoming interested in turning from a mechanical being to a biological being.\tThe age advancing make-up is believable and awe-inducing. I could hardly trust my eyes that Sam Neill wasn't an old man in the movie. However, although I can see that the filmmakers had no other reliable option, I disliked the jumps in time the it takes. The time gaps force us out of massive plot pieces, some of which are important to the character development.\tThere are some really funny moments in Bicentennial Man.

It's true bravura storytelling, without a single shot or moment that needs to be excised or missed. To say it's a 'perfect' movie might be overstating it; what is 'perfect', after all? Scorsese does strive for- and arguably succeeds- a kind of perfection in balancing comedy and drama, like a tightrope walker going above a bed of hot coals with a rambunctious Pesci threatening with scissors like the Oklahoma Kid. You're almost afraid to laugh, and a good many times (especially if you've seen the film dozens of times like myself) you almost feel apart of the group of guys laughing about stuff that *shouldn't* be funny.

Maybe as part of a subjective thing I can kind of relate to many of the characters, not so much because of what they do in their criminal deeds or Hill's mistress or feeding people to lions and whatnot, but the little ticks of behavior (a little note like when Hill rushes out of his coked-up girlfriend's apartment, laughing maniacally, is like any given day with my brother).But a personal connection can only be so much to recommend this motion picture like no other.
