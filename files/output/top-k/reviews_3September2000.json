[{"date":"3 September 2000","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  It's curious that Elizabeth has attracted so much flak for its screenplay's tendency to reinvent and mythologize the early history of Elizabeth I's reign, since treachery and fidelity, history and myth-making, are precisely what the film is about. As only becomes clear in the last few minutes (sort of spoiler alert!), the film is the history of an image - the famous public image of Gloriana, the virgin queen, powdered white and with a fright wig that makes her look halfway between a clown and a corpse, locked into a costume that restricts her movements to the ritualistic and barely human.  How could any human being become reduced, or inflated, to that iconic status? Kapur's film has a good deal of insight into the nature of the Tudor court, but its primary interest is less historically specific, more about the relationship between personality, celebrity and power.  But the broad lines of the history are quite rich.  There's an alternative myth of origins for English protestantism here, rather convincingly locating the psychological appeal of Elizabeth's church within, rather than outside, English Catholicism, by substituting the Virgin Queen for the Virgin Mary.  And its analysis of the relationship between Tudor politics and Tudor sex, private and public lives, is subtle and pointed, rather in tune with contemporary academic approaches.  There's little scholars need scorn, for all that a good deal of the details, the events, are as fictive as most of what you find in Tudor chronicles or the plays of Shakespeare based on them.So as a knowingly contemporary work of historical imagination, it's more sophisticated than anything since Sally Potter's glorious, if drastically uneven, Orlando (1993).  Unfortunately, like Orlando, Elizabeth is patchy, sometimes cringe-worthy. Some of the contemporary nudges are unsubtle (a weakness shared by The Madness of King George (1994), where the anxiety to make past and present dance to the same tune can leave the film historically adrift, risking relevance to nobody living or dead).  The soundtrack's late lurch from Elizabethan music into Elgar and Mozart's Requiem doesn't work at all, though you can see why director Kapur wanted to broaden the scope, to underscore (literally) how Elizabeth invents an English mythology - hence the Elgar.  The acting is a mixed bag while Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush are pillars of strength, there are some distractingly odd casting decisions, and Richard Attenborough is no better than usual.  But anyone interested in the ongoing history of how film deals with history, and indeed how history gets made in the first place, should put this on their to-see list. Nice frocks, too.

Saying it was almost as bad as The Man With The Golden Gun was downright cruel, and I concluded that it was quite possibly the most unappealing James Bond movie of all time.Well, one year later and I'm happy to report that I was wrong. Licence To Kill is a much, much better movie than I previously gave credit, and has a great deal of integrity.   Differing reports abound about how much this one made. Early reports alleged that the film only made back it's production costs, thus becoming the main cause of the franchise's hiatus. However, later evidence reveals that Licence To Kill grossed over $156 million world-wide, considerably more than it's $40m production.One factor of my original review &#150; the weak acting &#150; does still stand. However, if you isolate Carey Lowell, Talisa Soto, Everett McGill, David Hedison and Robert Brown, then it's possible to see the rot is not all the way through. It's a pity that the poor performances are so high-profile, though Robert Davi (hindered by having stereotyped Latin-American incidental music in virtually all of his scenes) is appealing as the lead villain, and Dalton, as ever, turns in a great performance, suitably underplayed. Bond is often unshaven, has a bad hair day, and looks scared on no less than four occasions. Not quite the suave, unflappable gentleman spy.What makes Licence To Kill different &#150; and unique in the Bond canon &#150; is that this is Bond without the fabrications of cinema. All fantasy parameters are lifted, and we get to see the 007 of real life. Hence, when Bond gets hit, he bleeds (a lot). The villain, Franz Sanchez, is an established drug dealer, not a megalomaniac trying to take over the world, and, though he does have the requisite shark tank, here the shark in question does get to have a snack. When criminals capture women, they are not tied up awaiting rescue, but they are raped, or beaten with crocodile whips. Men are garrotted, or have their hearts cut out, while bad language can be heard, and Bond tells an agent to p*** off. Bond's latest attachment gets upset and refuses him comfort after he's been caught sleeping with another woman. In the most obvious nod towards the cartoon-like Bonds of yesteryear, Sanchez has a pet with a diamond necklace &#150; but instead of a fey pussycat, it's an iguana.James &#150; who claims to come from Universal Exports &#150; is here in America to take on the US at it's own game.

Leave it to the Americans, he's told, it's their mess, let them clear it up. But Bond won't leave it to the Americans; he's determined to show us he can do it better. Before a well-shot action finale, Dalton gets to play detective, the first time in recent memory the Secret Service Agent had actually gone undercover, which is, after all, his job. When James drops an enemy into a fatal tank full of electric eels, he no longer makes a quip (Shocking is probably what Roger Moore would have offered) but looks on in askance. Dalton plays a particularly bitter, disattached 007 and it's easy to see why some regarded him as uncharismatic. Like Davi, his underplaying of the role is out of character for a Bond film, and audiences weren't used to having their intelligence respected. A James Bond film where he opts out and is no longer a member of the Secret Service? No, the audience wanted smuggy Brosnan and his by the numbers set pieces. They wanted cars, girls, explosions, and to hell with character and original plotting.Into all this, the comedic set pieces of Q's gadgetry seem oddly out of place.

Dalton is a dutiful son, attentive to the last, and his deadpan delivery actually adds more to some of the funny lines. I particularly like the way he delivers the line to the barmaid who asks if a henchman wants a drink. After smashing his head on the table, Dalton replies He's had enough &#150; run the tab. Some of the plot devices used to push forward the story are also a little suspect. What's going on? Bond asks an airport receptionist, on hearing alarms.

Similarly, Bond's ingratiation into Sanchez's inner circle is not through his own skill, but via coincidence\/contrivance. In fact, this is the least satisfying element, as it means the central premise is shaky in its credibility. Certainly not perfect, but a hell of a lot better than first viewing may make it appear; Licence To Kill has average opening titles, but a pleasing theme song, and, in Bond's last words to Sanchez, one of the most satisfying pay-offs of the whole series.

Some there are who see it as a brilliant exercise in creative, thought-provoking moviemaking, a film that challenges the notion that modern American cinema is comprised exclusively of formulaic retreads of earlier films or slick, mechanical displays of technical virtuosity, devoid of meaning and feeling. Others view `Magnolia' as the nom plus ultra of pretentiousness and self-satisfied smugness.  Which of the two assessments is the correct one &#150; or does the truth lie somewhere in between?Actually, there is much to admire and cherish in `Magnolia.' Writer\/director Paul Thomas Anderson has done a commendable job in putting on the screen a relatively unique vision &#150; a qualification I feel forced to make because it does seem patently derived from much of the trailblazing work of director Robert Altman.  Like Altman, Anderson creates a vast canvas of barely-related and briefly overlapping storylines and characters that come together under the umbrella of a single major theme and a few minor ones as well.  Anderson's concern is to explore the concept of forgiveness and to examine the part it plays in the redemption we all seek through the course of our lifetimes.  In this film, dying characters struggle to make amends with the loved ones they will soon leave behind, while estranged characters grope tentatively to establish or re-establish the bonds that must link them to other members of the human race.  Anderson presents a tremendously wide range of characters, though for a film set in the northern areas of Los Angeles, `Magnolia' provides a surprisingly non-diverse sea of Caucasian faces.  However, in terms of the ages of the characters, Anderson's crew seems more comprehensive, running the gamut from a pre-teen wiz kid to a terminally ill man in his mid-60's.  Many of these characters seem to have created any number of facades to help them cope with the miseries and disappointments of life &#150; and much of the redemption occurs only after those masks are stripped away revealing the emptiness and hurt that, in many cases, lurks so close to the surface.Thematically, then, Anderson's film is a compelling one.  Dramatically, however, it suffers from some serious flaws.  Many viewers and critics have called `Magnolia' an artistic advancement, in both depth and scope, for Anderson, whose previous film was the similarly dense, moderately freeform `Boogie Nights.'  I tend to disagree.  If anything, `Boogie Nights,' by limiting itself to a much more narrowly restricted milieu &#150; the 1970's porn industry &#150; and focusing intently on a single main character, managed to connect more directly with the emotions of the audience.  `Magnolia,' by being more expansive, paradoxically, seems more contracted.  The pacing is often languid and the screenplay, running a bit over three hours, often seems bloated given the single-mindedness of its basic theme.  Certainly, a few of these characters and storylines could have been dispensed with at no great cost to the film as a whole.  By lining up all his characters to fit into the same general theme, the author allows his message to become a bit heavy-handed and over-emphatic.  Anderson seems to want to capture the whole range of human experience on his enormous (and enormously long) movie canvas, yet because the characters seem to all be tending in the same direction - and despite the fact that the details of their experiences are different - the net effect is thematically claustrophobic.The controversial ending, in which an event of literally biblical proportions occurs, feels generally right in the context of this film, though with some reservations.  It seems perfectly in tune with the quality of heightened realism that Anderson establishes and sustains throughout the picture.  On the other hand, the ending does pinpoint one of the failures of the film as a whole.  Given that the screenplay has a strong Judeo-Christian subtext running all the way through it, one wonders why Anderson felt obliged to approach the religious issues in such strictly oblique terms. None of the characters &#150; not even those who are dying &#150; seem to turn to God for their forgiveness and redemption.  In fact, one wonders what purpose that quirky ending serves since the characters are well on their way to making amends by the time it happens.Anderson has marshaled an array of first-rate performances from a talented, well-known cast.  Tom Cruise provides a wrenching case study of a shallow, charismatic shyster, who has parleyed his misogyny into a lucrative self-help industry.  Yet, like many of the characters, he uses this façade as a shield to hide the hurt caused by a father who abandoned him and a mother whose slow, painful death he was forced to witness alone.  The other actors, too numerous to mention, turn in equally worthy performances. Particularly interesting is the young boy who, in counterpoint to one of the other characters in the story, manages to save himself at an early age from the crippling effect of identity usurpation that it has taken so many others in this film a lifetime to overcome.In many ways, `Magnolia' is the kind of film that could easily serve as the basis for a lengthy doctoral dissertation for a student majoring in either filmmaking or sociology.  The density of its vision would surely yield up many riches of character, symbolism and theme that a first time viewer of the film would undoubtedly miss.   Thus, in many ways, `Magnolia' is that rare film that seems to demand repeat exposure even for those audience members who may not `get it' the first time.  As a viewing experience, `Magnolia' often seems rambling and purposeless, but it does manage to get under one's skin, and, unlike so many other, less ambitious works, this one grows in retrospect.

In an anime format, this is kind of distracting; even high-quality anime tends to use a lower frame rate most of the time and only switches to ultra-smooth for key moments, whether action- or drama-based.  Lets you know when you should be paying attention.  This movie didn't have that kind of rhythm to it.  On a related note, I felt like a lot of the visual language of anime was missing, from the blurry backgrounds in action scenes to facial mugging, etc.  Not that it's bad to be different, but these are tools that help carry the story in Japanese animation that were AWOL here and would have helped.  What about that story?  Well, I'd rate it with Akira's.  I enjoy convoluted plots (see Ghost in the Shell) but I really had trouble understanding the motivation of many of the characters in this story, from Mononoke herself to the male lead to the woman running Iron Town.

Where to start?  The animation is quite good, almost too good.  Having watched a lot of anime, most of this movie felt preternaturally smooth - very high frame rate for large portions of the film.  In an anime format, this is kind of distracting; even high-quality anime tends to use a lower frame rate most of the time and only switches to ultra-smooth for key moments, whether action- or drama-based.  Lets you know when you should be paying attention.  This movie didn't have that kind of rhythm to it.  On a related note, I felt like a lot of the visual language of anime was missing, from the blurry backgrounds in action scenes to facial mugging, etc.  Not that it's bad to be different, but these are tools that help carry the story in Japanese animation that were AWOL here and would have helped.  What about that story?  Well, I'd rate it with Akira's.  I enjoy convoluted plots (see Ghost in the Shell) but I really had trouble understanding the motivation of many of the characters in this story, from Mononoke herself to the male lead to the woman running Iron Town.  And the ending?**SPOILER WARNING**Humans good, nature bad, basically.  I mean, they killed the forest spirit and get to rape the area for its mineral wealth; oh but wait, they feel bad so it's okay.  Only a country that still hunts whales commercially could crank out a moral like that.  **END SPOILER WARNING**Now don't get me wrong, I'm ecstatic to see decent (and it was decent, despite my tone here) anime making its way to US cinemas, but this is not the greatest thing since the Walkman to cross the Pacific.  If you're looking for that quality, check out Ghost in the Shell or Macross Plus, or even Ninja Scroll if you don't mind serious gore.

I don't even think its that great. And the whole don't kill and you choose who you are stuff felt like it was so forced and written by the mpaa; i felt like i was being preached to by some school teacher. I also thought the remarkable convienence of the off\/on lever on the power generators was soo funny. And boy did I cringe alot when the giant acted like an idiot. I also thought it was funny that the flashlight on Hogarth's gun was strapped so close to the gun's nozzle that if he fired it he'd blow out his flashlight. Also, when kent finds the gun, its broken off to say hog hug but later we can see it reads hoga hugh. I also don't understand the bump on the giant's head, I mean when he goes nuts, pops out but then he's still able to calm down without the bump so its like what's the point of the bump when it doesn't affect his behavior?On the plus side, IG is well animated, I liked watching the characters Annie, Kent, the General. I thought Hogarth, Dean, and the Giant's characters had some likeable moments and dislikeable moments. The premise is interesting and executed well. Its a change from what Disney has done.

Pirate ships, police chases, treasure chests full of gold and surrounded by human skeletons with patches over the eyes, the inherent excitement in the possibility of a cavernous wonder world beneath the very streets where they live. The Goonies is about a group of kids who have grown up together and are about to be torn apart because their parents are being forced to sell their homes. In the attic of one of their houses (Mikey, played by Sean Astin), they find an endless supply of fascinating things - treasure maps, paintings, cryptic writings in strange languages. They find a map that sounds promising, and decide to see if it has any value, hoping to be able to find enough treasure to prevent their parents from losing their homes. Not only was The Goonies a brilliantly written, directed, and acted movie, but it was also so much FUN! The adventures of these kids through the underground world, while being chased by the despicable villains known as the Fratellis, are fascinating to watch. The Goonies is a great cinematic experience. It has everything that anyone who was ever a kid could ever want. Even the elaborate sets are very convincing. The sense of adventure and hope that are presented in The Goonies is very uplifting and inspiring. The lovable characters are perfectly developed and endlessly entertaining. Many of them, particularly Sean Astin and Corey Feldman, delivered the best performances of their future careers right here in this early adventure film. This movie can be enjoyed by virtually anyone, which is one of its best values. It is truly timeless, and it should not be missed.

But having overcome these minor problems, as well as the traditional stereotyping of the cockneys, Irish and Americans (among others), the film is wholly enjoyable. Most impressive for a relatively low-budget movie such as this were the camera effects and the soundtrack. Director Guy Ritchie is such a master of the former that some of his more contrived camera angles and movements were alone enough to invoke laughter. Many of the jokes are in fact derived from the excellent script, which was in part written by Ritchie himself, although some of the humour originates from the brilliant acting.There will of course be some who complain that Snatch degrades cinema, inciting audiences to laugh at violence. But it is only because the movie is so involving and evocative that the audience feels morally secure enough to cheer on, and laugh with, the gangsters on screen. The most promising thing about this film is that Guy Ritchie has proved himself to be a more than capable director, and not just a one-hit wonder (his previous movie, Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels (1998), was also critically acclaimed).The US has always been quite reluctant in its uptake of foreign movies, especially those as alien as Snatch. But this movie is so funny, and its plot is so clever, that it is well worth seeing, even if you are American. I'd pay $10 to see this any day. 9 out of 10.
