I have been very public in this forum about the vileness of films like The Haunting and Urban Legend and such. I feel that they (and others like them) don't know what true horror is. And it bothered me to the point where it made me go to my local video store and rent some of the classic horror films. I already own all the Friday's so I rented The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the original Nightmare On Elm Street, Jaws, The Exorcist, Angel Heart, The Exorcist and Halloween. Now the other films are classics in their own right but it is here that I want to tell you about Halloween. Because what Halloween does is perhaps something no other film in the history of horror film can do, and that is it uses subtle techniques, techniques that don't rely on blood and gore, and it uses these to scare the living daylights out of you. I was in a room by myself with the lights off and as silly as I knew it was, I wanted to look behind me to see if Michael Myers was there. No movie that I have seen in the last ten years has done that to me. No movie.John Carpenter took a low budget film and he scared a generation of movie goers. He showed that you don't need budgets in the 8 or 9 figures to evoke fear on an audience. Because sometimes the best element of fear is not what actually happens, but what is about to happen. What was that shadow? What was that noise upstairs? He knows that these are the ways to scare someone and he uses every element of textbook horror that I think you can use. I even think he made up some of his own ideas and these should be ideas that people use today. But they don't. No one uses lighting and detail to provoke scares, they use special effects and rivers of blood. And it is just not the same. You can't be scared by a giant special effect that makes loud noises and jumps out of a wall. It's the moments when the killer is lurking, somewhere, you just don't know where, that scare you. And Halloween succeeds like no other film in this endeavor.In 1963 a young Micael Myers kills his sister with a large butcher knife and then spends the next 15 years of his life, silently locked up in an institute. As Loomis ( his doctor) says to Sheriff Brackett,  I spent eight years trying to reach him and then another seven making sure that he never gets out, because what I saw behind those eyes was pure e-vil.  That sets up the manic and relentless idea of a killer that will stop at nothing to get what he wants. And all he wants here is to kill Laurie. No one know why he wants to kill her, but he does.( Halloween II continues the story quite well )What Carpenter has done here is taken a haunting score, mendacious lighting techniques and wrote and directed a tightly paced masterpiece of horror. There is one scene that has to be described. And that is the scene where Annie is on her way to pick up Paul. She goes to the car and tries to open it. Only then does she realize that she has left her keys in the house. She gets them, comes back out and inadvertently opens the car door without using the keys. The audience picks up on this but she doesn't. She is too busy thinking about Paul. When she sits down, she notices that the windows are fogged up. She is puzzled and starts to wipe away the mist, and then Myers strikes, from the back seat. This is such a great scene because it pays attention to detail. We know what is happening and Annie doesn't. But it's astute observations that Carpenter made that scared the hell out of movie goers in 1978 and beyond. Halloween uses blurry images of a killer standing in the background, it has shadows ominously gliding across a wall, dark rooms, creepy and haunting music, a sinister story told hauntingly by Donald Pleasance and a menacing, relentless killer. My advice to film makers in our day and age is to study Halloween. It should be the blue print for what scary movies are all about. After all, Carpenter followed in Hitchcock's steps, maybe director's should follow in his.Halloween personifies everything that scares us. If you are tired of all the mindless horror films that don't know the difference between evil and cuteness, then Halloween is a film that should be seen. It won't let you down. I enjoy being scared, I don't know why, but I do. But nothing has scared me in the 90's, except maybe one film ( Wes Craven's final Nightmare ). If you enjoy beings scared, then Halloween is one that you should see. And if you have already seen it a hundred times, go and watch it again, back to back with a film like Urban Legend. Urban Legend will have you enticed at all the pretty faces in the movie. Halloween will have you frozen with fear, stuck in your seat, not wanting to move. Now tell me, what horror film would you rather watch?And just to follow up after seeing Zombie's version, it makes you appreciate this that much more. This is a classic by definition. Zombie bastardized his version, but it doesn't take away from the brilliance of this one.

The side-plots are no picnic either.  Is the opening twenty minutes dealing with the guns dealer dude supposed to reveal Travolta's character, or did it have no point?  Was it just to establish why he was there so we wouldn't have to suffer the accent?  Was there a point to it?  Also the romance\/reminiscing between Travolta and his ex was better than the plot, though it extended the movie another fifteen minutes.  It slowed it down.

The script was hilarious, the characters were unique, the score was infectious and the direction was sparkling youthful ingenuity.I love this movie so much because it has to be the only movie (or one of the rare,rare movies) that made me feel this great after I saw it.  It is the ultimate feel-good movie because it has ZERO amount of cheese and just the right dollop of..umm feel-goodness for lack of a better term.Max Fischer is the best character I've seen on screen.  What fascinates me about him is that technically he is so unreal--I don't know anyone and I can't imagine anyone being close to a Max Fischer--and yet in the movie he is made real, he is made incarnate as a believable human being--one with passions, faults, quirks, mannerisms, etc.In my opinion the movie was really about the maturing of Max Fischer. Max Fischer was a guy boy could--and did--do anything. From his enrollment in Rushmore at age seven he was an overachieving freak, an oversuccessful success story.  And in that sense, he was spoiled. Then he falls in love with Miss Cross and for the first time ever he has a goal he cannot achieve. By the end of the movie he has grown up because he lets this goal go; this shows in the resolution between him and Cross and Herman (Murray).There were so many beautiful parts in this movie Max's speech in his new public school (he was a fish out of water, it was hilarious); the part when Max introduces Herman to his dad, a barber and *not* a brain surgeon; Max's first meeting with Miss Cross.. Every scene in this movie is perfect; the fact that the movie doesn't drag is a major plus.All in all, I loved this movie. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys a funny, feel-good movie.by the way, can someone please give me another word for feel-good?!?!

Mike Myers came out of that movie looking like a comic genius, but after seeing AP2, I'm beginning to wonder if he's just a Gen-X Dan Aykroyd.For starters, it is important for any movie, even a spoof, to have some kind of plot.  Yes, AP1 had a underdeveloped skeleton of a plot, but it did propel the story.  AP2 constantly fizzles out because there's never any place to go after the latest gag.  In AP1, the fish-out-of-water gag propelled the story.  In AP2, gags were carried on until they just couldn't go any further, and then the story needed to be restarted again.Secondly, Heather Graham was given absolutely nothing to work with in AP2.  Elizabeth Hurley was one of the best things about AP1, because it was her straight-man act that propelled so much of the comedy and the conflict in the story.  The audience could easily relate to her.  Heather Graham, on the other hand, serves as backdrop.  She is given absolutely nothing funny to work with.  Sure, she's sexy... but she's never given a chance to serve as a foil to Austin's hijinks.Another thing, several of the best characters in AP1 were woefully underused in AP2.  Seth Green is the first name who comes to mind.  His Jerry Springer appearance was amusing, but after that, he practically disappears.  Mindy Sterling did well with what she was given, but once again, her character has very little to do in the final third of the film.    Finally, pop culture references are great, but some of the ones used in this one weren't up to par.  The Will Smith parody sticks out as something that will not age well with repeated viewings.  It's a real challenge to find things that relate to audiences of 1999 but won't be lost on audiences of 2009.  I will admit that the Starbucks and Jerry Springer gags will probably age well in the future.I'm just disappointed that AP2 has become the more recognized film in this series, because it contains little of the manic energy that the first one had.  Sadly, I think this franchise has already run its course.  Here's hoping that Mike Myers can put together another great character without strip-mining it after just 2 movies.

But if I have to compare it to another film, then it's Tim Burton's BATMAN and Ridley Scott's BLADE RUNNER meets the Farley brother's DUMB & DUMBER. It's a film with excellent sets, costumes, and backgrounds mixed with outrageous humor.  And with that, I thought it was a excellent film! The plot is set in a Metropolis\/Gotham City like city called Champion City.  While Metropolis has Superman and Gotham has Batman, Champion has Captain Amazing (Greg Kinner).  And instead of Captain Amazing being like Superman, and just wanting to fight crime for truth, justice, and the American way, he instead fights crime for publicity.  When Captain Amazing is being told that some of the sponsors he wears on his super-suit are pulling out from sponsoring him due to lack of crime-fighting.  Amazing decides to set free one of his most notorious rivals free from the insane asylum, Dr. Cassanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush).  Meanwhile, there are three superhero wanna-be's who would like to fight crime also, sadly they just don't have the luck.  One is Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), the other is the Shoveler (William H. Macy), and the third is the Blue Raja (Hank Azaria).  They would like to assist Captain Amazing and become superhero's themselves, however they need more practice.  When Dr. Frankensein kidnaps Captain Amazing, that is the calling card of the three wannabes to set fourth, save their superhero and their city.  So they recruit some more people with so-called super powers.  The Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), the Spleen (Paul Rubens), Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), and the Sphinx (Wes Studi).  From there on is a non-stop film with laughs and fun. I couldn't really know on what to think about MYSTERY MEN, after first watching it.  But now I realized that it is a clever and intellegent satire of the comic book stories that many of us grew up with.  It is indeed funny at times, and at other times, it gets weird.  But it never gets dull or boring throughout the movie, and I was glad of that. I thought the sets were amazing in the HAUNTING, but now I think the HAUNTING looks plain compared to the sets of MYSTERY MEN.  The sets for MYSTERY MEN were outstanding!!  Mixing it with BATMAN and BLADE RUNNER and Terry Gilliam's BRAZIL, it's some of the most fantastic sets that I have ever seen!  I would be disappointed if it doesn't win a Oscar. The acting in this film is also quite good.  Rush, Kinner, Studi, Rubens, and Azaria all do a good job in their roles.  However the three that stood out were Macy, Stiller, and Garofalo.  Garofalo is particularly good as the smarty Bowler who is heroic, yet has a smart alec attitude and talks to her bowling ball with the skull of her dead father's head. Overall, MYSTERY MEN is a delightful treat, a great tounge-in-cheek homage to the classic superhero comics that we all grew up on, mixed with plot twists and modern humor.  I think those who love comic books or comic style movies will love this movie like I did.  However, those who are expecting just a comedy will probably not like it that much.  But I highly enjoyed it and think it's one of the best films this year!  I'm hoping that first time director Kinka Usher is planning on doing a follow-up to MYSTERY MEN, because it would be fun to see these wannbe super heros again fighting for justice.

","genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller"},{"date":"28 July 1999","score":"","review":"  I read so much on the making of STARSHIP TROOPERS before it even came out and the makers I qoute the writer from a magazine No, this is not a serious sf movie.  He said that before it was released, not after.  A point could be made if the makers had said it was not meant to be taken serious after it was released as being a last minute cover up for a failure to actually make a serious movie.  However, since they said it before it was released before it was even finished, you can definitely take their word on it that it was not meant to be takens seriously.  If you read the definition of the word satire, you will see this movie is just that.  It takes a fascist society, part of our society and culture and exaggerates it.  If you look at those old propaganda commercials of the former Nazi Germany and compare them to the ones used here, you will that the ones used in this movie are taken even further with a light heartedness missing from the original nazi germany commercials.  I remember that back in 1941, the germans had the option to put into action the Me 262 fighter jet, instead of the Me109 but instead Hitler went with the Me 109.  If Germany had used the Me 262 instead, they could taken out most of our bombers before we would have been able to catch up with their technology.  I feel this mistake the Germans made can be found in the movie.  They have such elaborate space vessels that can travel at light speeds, weapons able to destroy the bug boulders but instead of just using this against the bugs, they send in ground troops.  The germans as well as in any fascist society puts all of it emphasis on the military state and anyone who is not part of the military is looked down upon.  That is taken to extreme in this film as well.  Everyone who is not a civilian is gung ho about the war but it is all presented in the same manner Leslie Nielsen said funny lines with a straight, serious face to achieve a comical touch and the same is applied here.  Now listen to a lot of people in our country, especially right-wingers and listen how they condone the death penality and seem to take much pleasure in actually watching a man be murdered by the state.  In the movie, there is a internet commercial that announces you can watch a live execution on TV of a condemmed prisoner.  I know so many right-wingers in this country would love that right on their Television screen.  You notice we don't have that in our country but the movie takes the attitude of a lot of these right-wingers and takes it to the next level with a live television broadcast execution.  We have something close but not yet, just the option to watch an execution.  Then there is the bugs, who have no personality or any distinguished features, just a desire to kill anything in their way.  Well during World War II the masses in our country thought Hitler and the germans, the Japanese ect were monsters with no personality.  Our soldiers treated them like they were bugs and we thought they were just something equal to bugs, just ask the innocent women of those countries that our soldiers took pleasure in putting in trucks and well you know....don't need to mention it.  Well, in this movie the soldiers do the exact same thing with the bugs and just want to kill them all without thinking twice about it.  I feel the bugs are an exaggeration representing the attitude our country has taken towards its enemies in previous wars.  Just examine the attitudes we had towards the communists during the 50s, 60s, 70s and even 80s.  Shoot some of us still have those attitudes, that they were evil and monsters.  President Reagan flat out called The Soviet Union the evil empire.  I rest my case.  The characters in the movie don't even question the bugs motives, they just go and kill them.  We did the same thing after the japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, we just wanted to go in and get them and we did.  We bombed a lot of their children in Nagasaki and Hiroshima to kingdom come and a lot of us still don't think twice about it, especially the right wingers.  The boot camp sequence is the best example in the movie, however, of its being a satire.  The marine corps drill instructors have been known to punch and humiliate their recruits, for their own good no less and in the movie they go the extreme.  They not only hit them but break their arms, throw knives at their hands and give them public lashings!  Our military has never gone that far but it has come close, again the movie takes it to the next step.  Of some historical note, Fascist Italy of World War II was started and controlled by veterans of World War I and other wars.  They fought bravely and sweated it out.  They then decided to create a country and they looked down on anyone who had not fought as soldiers, the same thing as well as in the book apply to this movie.  However, the movie has the entire world taken over by former veterans of war.  I highly recommend this film because of the satiralnature behind it all.

Yes, you can see some touches of inspiration in this period piece, but I think it really fell short. For its day, the boxing sequence was pretty good, though I was more impressed by straight ahead camera angles in Requiem for a Heavyweight. Kubrick's gladiators didn't even seem like they were taking hard shots at each other -- not nearly as hard as the sound effects would have you believe.Anyway, I thought Irene Cane did a fine job playing a wayward girl looking for some purpose in life. She latches onto whatever lifts her spirit for the moment and then can so easily turn it away with a casual look. So near the end of the film when she's pleading for her life with her offer to leave her new lover to marry the thug she had seemed to take pleasure in spurning, we just aren't sure whether she is simply acting desperate or if she really can recant her affection so easily. And the main character, Davy Gordon, openly considers this too as he dashes through the window to save his own neck.If the film just ended right there, with those threds left unresolved, it would have been a much better movie. Davy could have boarded his train to the West never knowing what became of his two-day girlfriend or the thug she tried to appease. And wouldn't it have been ironic if she were forced to marry that man -- like her sister was forced to marry someone she didn't love? That would have been a cruel twist of fate indeed!Yet what we got was neither cruel or unusual or even mysterious. No, we got the standard Hollywood ending to a film which had done a good job of breaking a standard Hollywood mold to that point. If it wasn't Kubrick making this film, making that woman run down the stairs into her lover's waiting arms as the big music came up to signal the Happy Ending(TM), I would have just clicked off the TV and forgot all about it. But this is Stanley Kubrick!!!!!! Boy was I disappointed! The only thing I can hope for was that the movie studio forced him to edit his true ending and Kubrick wasn't in a position to reject them at that early stage in his career.Oh well. See this movie if you're a Kubrick fan, but don't say I didn't warn you that the ending is completely Hollywood.
