Not only was his character an annoying idiot with an inflated ego about the size of NYC, but, his overall appearance was utterly creepy, and his attitude so downright lecherous, that he made my skin crawl, big time.I mean, this guy struck me as one of those totally ugly, self-loving, middle-aged farts who have really foul body odor and the most ghastly, bad breath imaginable. (He also struck me as a potential rapist and, yes, perhaps, even a possible child-molester, as well) And, believe me, when Ewell actually kissed Monroe smack-dab on the lips, I could easily imagine director Billy Wilder having to immediately cut the scene at that point so that Marilyn could go and throw up in the nearest sink\/toilet\/whatever and then furiously brush her teeth with Dazzledent toothpaste in order to get rid of Ewell's hideous reek.Hey!

You might be asking yourself, wait a minute, this movie was made for children? First off, the language is a bit harsh- Many of the characters swear, mostly referring to hell, and condemning people to hell. While, I don't like the reference to the Occult, bad like other critics because the fact that it's set during Halloween. I did had a problem with the movie problem with virginity in teenagers. Honestly, for a kid's movie by Disney, I thought they wouldn't be promoting underage sex, but this movie loves to mention a billion times, that being a virgin will cause witches to come back alive, and try to steal your youth. The film loves to focus on the fact that the main character is embarrassed of being a virgin and that some people have a problem with him still being a virgin. Come on, movie. The kid has just became a teenager. Do you really feel that he should knock up some girl or have multiply partners to the point that he gets STDs or AIDS? I felt that this movie teaches children to lose their virginity quickly which is wrong. There is nothing wrong with being a virgin in your teenager years. This is very unusual for Disney to promote. The movie is selling sex like crazy in this film, from his mother wearing a Madonna pointy bra to his little sister calling attention to his girlfriend's breast. It's like the movie was a pre-teen horn dog. Directed by Kenny Ortega, the movie focus on three witches known as the Sanderson Sisters. The first witch is Sarah Sanderson (Sarah Jessica Parker), the youngest witch sister who has the dumb slutty blonde archetype. It's weird in a way, because this movie is made for children, yet her character is always trying to grind on the laps of men throughout the film and her breasts are always partially exposed. In my opinion, it's one of the few movies where I find Sarah Jessica Parker, kinda attractive. The other sister is Mary Sanderson, who looks and acts like the cannibal Witch Hazel from the Looney Toons cartoon. The last is Winifred 'Winnie' Sanderson (Bette Midler), the buck-toothed leader of the Sanderson sisters who hates being call ugly. The three witches were inadvertently resurrected by a virgin teenager Max (Omri Katz) along with his sister Dani (Thora Birch) and classmate Allison (Vinessa Shaw). Now, they must fix their mistake, by stopping the witches with the help of Thackery Binx (Sean Murray) who been turn into a cat, years ago in 1693. For a kid's movie, it's one of the few movies Disney movies that has a children die on screen. Oh my God, the overacting in this movie is way too much. It was a bit over the top. The movie does have some funny moments that was this pretty laughable even if this movie is a bit dated. Amok! Amok, amok, amok, amok! Still, makes me laugh. Still, it had some sloppy writing. I do like the Penny and Gary Marshall cameo as 'the Master'. I Put A Spell On You music number in the middle of the film seems fun, but how on earth, did the Sanderson sisters know the lyrics, if they been dead for 300 years? Come little children was a pretty haunting creepy lullaby and Jessica Sarah Parker did a great song with the song. Like I said before, I don't know how this movie was ever made for children, but it was indeed made. The movie has this weird tone, as its seems to poke out of the box of safe Disney movies, just a small bit, that parents wouldn't question it too much. What other Disney movies can you see a cat get ran over or a zombie name Billy Bitcherson (Doug Jones) get his head kick off. Yes, a lot of gruesome body parts scenes in this movie. The 1990's special effects were pretty OK at the time. I agree that practical effects often look better but this film is far from that proof and holds up very well and seems to gain an even larger following as time progresses. While, never a huge hit in the box office, the film was released to VHS and was rebroadcast annually on television during Halloween, which I happen to find this movie. Overall it's a good movie that had a lot of dark humor, that you wouldn't see much in the tamer more modern Disney movies.

","genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy"},{"date":"28 October 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Having just taken delivery of the 40th Anniversary Blu-Ray edition and watched the director's cut I am reminded fully of just why this is one of the most influential and important motion pictures ever made. The longer cut (by 11 minutes) doesn't add that much to the theatrical version (also included) apart from a minimal feeling of having watched a slightly more complete and thorough presentation. But, really, it's neither here nor there.The plot is simple. Daughter of actress single mother is possessed by an evil spirit (may or may not be the devil), an Old Catholic priest intervenes to perform an exorcism and he's accompanied by a young modern Jesuit priest experiencing a crisis of faith. Yes, simple. But the content, the events and the themes explored within are immensely complex and emotionally affecting.It's a tale of good versus evil, of the power of religious faith along with redemption through self- sacrifice. Now I'm not a religious person but even I was impressed by the compelling and matter-of-fact way the film seeks to reaffirm belief in the existence of both God and the Devil. And I still remain astonished at the amount of religiously oriented people, even today, who are offended by this film. Considering it works on an acceptance of God's existence and clearly shows good triumphing over the best efforts of malicious evil; how is that offensive exactly? What I personally find offensive, but admittedly unsurprising, is the number of people who haven't actually seen the film but feel qualified to critique and judge it. This is a testament to the closed-minded intolerance of religion and the power of media mythology. More powerful than God for some, it would seem.Undeniably, pure evil is depicted as monstrous, defiling, sick, twisted, malevolent and destructive. The host child is physically tortured and made to behave supernaturally and unspeakably. Well, what would anyone expect &#x96; a demon that just pops around for crumpets and afternoon tea with perhaps a sedate game of lawn croquet thrown in for a clincher?The deal here is, for those of a particularly media susceptible and narrow-minded nature and those who haven't seen it but know something of the reputation; put aside the myths and sensationalism surrounding THE EXORCIST. This stuff is causing you to miss out on experiencing a classic exercise in pure cinema.Friedkin (director) and Blatty (writer) employ almost peerless craftsmanship in structuring and executing this film. It represents the masterwork of both and they will probably never better it. There is some incredibly fine acting on show from Ellen Burstyn, Max Von Sydow, Lee J. Cobb and Jason Miller. Not forgetting the best ever screen work of Linda Blair. As the possessed child she is a revelation. Whatever subsequent acting performance she gave as an adult it was, quite honestly, atrocious in comparison. Child actors are unselfconscious and blessed with monumental confidence and self-belief and the ability to imaginatively project. Some of them lose this when they grow up. Linda Blair certainly did. However, in THE EXORCIST, she was something else entirely.The screenplay by William Peter Blatty is one of the most carefully composed and atmospherically chilling pieces one could imagine. He draws each and every character as a three-dimensional human being and takes time over development. Quite remarkable, considering Blatty had been a hack comedy writer up to this point (he scripted, of all things, the Peter Sellers Inspector Clouseau flick A SHOT IN THE DARK).Friedkin directs each shot with painstaking care and an eye for making the commonplace seem frightful and unsettling. Case in point is the scene when Ellen Burstyn is simply walking home in daylight. Autumn leaves blow along the street, kids trick-or-treating run by, the wind tugs the habits of some passing nuns, and Mike Oldfield's signature loop from Tubular Bells plays in the background. It is really uncannily unnerving. And quite brilliant. Friedkin's choice of this particular music is inspired, but it's used very, very sparingly (only twice?) throughout the movie. Oldfield's piano repeat has a weird hook\/tempo that the listener can never quite get their head around. This is what makes it addictive and unsettling and it gets into your head, stays there and helps set a unique tone.The audio visual tapestry Friedkin weaves builds steadily and seamlessly through a series of escalating events and the tension increases in sympathy. Owen Roizman's cinematography is absolutely magnificent, framing the story in a psychologically affecting range of strikingly beautiful textures and tones. Add the support of some immaculately subtle audio effects, the incredible vocalism of Mercedes McCambridge and some truly shocking but never arbitrary or exploitative sequences, and you have one of the most frightening and emotionally rewarding cinematic experiences ever committed to film.THE EXORCIST is one of those rarest phenomena; like PSYCHO, it's a movie that invokes strong feelings in anyone who sees it by intricately creating an atmosphere that is unrivalled in film. There has never been anything else quite like it. And probably never will be again. It's pure cinema and as such demands and deserves the attention it gets. Scrap the media-generated infamy and see it for what it is.The Blu-Ray print is a thing of impressive beauty &#x96; crisp, clean, fresh and vibrant. The director's cut has a very slight edge over the theatrical release, if only for providing the most complete viewing platform available.

","genre":null},{"date":"28 October 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Having just taken delivery of the 40th Anniversary Blu-Ray edition and watched the director's cut I am reminded fully of just why this is one of the most influential and important motion pictures ever made. The longer cut (by 11 minutes) doesn't add that much to the theatrical version (also included) apart from a minimal feeling of having watched a slightly more complete and thorough presentation. But, really, it's neither here nor there.The plot is simple. Daughter of actress single mother is possessed by an evil spirit (may or may not be the devil), an Old Catholic priest intervenes to perform an exorcism and he's accompanied by a young modern Jesuit priest experiencing a crisis of faith. Yes, simple. But the content, the events and the themes explored within are immensely complex and emotionally affecting.It's a tale of good versus evil, of the power of religious faith along with redemption through self- sacrifice. Now I'm not a religious person but even I was impressed by the compelling and matter-of-fact way the film seeks to reaffirm belief in the existence of both God and the Devil. And I still remain astonished at the amount of religiously oriented people, even today, who are offended by this film. Considering it works on an acceptance of God's existence and clearly shows good triumphing over the best efforts of malicious evil; how is that offensive exactly? What I personally find offensive, but admittedly unsurprising, is the number of people who haven't actually seen the film but feel qualified to critique and judge it. This is a testament to the closed-minded intolerance of religion and the power of media mythology. More powerful than God for some, it would seem.Undeniably, pure evil is depicted as monstrous, defiling, sick, twisted, malevolent and destructive. The host child is physically tortured and made to behave supernaturally and unspeakably. Well, what would anyone expect &#x96; a demon that just pops around for crumpets and afternoon tea with perhaps a sedate game of lawn croquet thrown in for a clincher?The deal here is, for those of a particularly media susceptible and narrow-minded nature and those who haven't seen it but know something of the reputation; put aside the myths and sensationalism surrounding THE EXORCIST. This stuff is causing you to miss out on experiencing a classic exercise in pure cinema.Friedkin (director) and Blatty (writer) employ almost peerless craftsmanship in structuring and executing this film. It represents the masterwork of both and they will probably never better it. There is some incredibly fine acting on show from Ellen Burstyn, Max Von Sydow, Lee J. Cobb and Jason Miller. Not forgetting the best ever screen work of Linda Blair. As the possessed child she is a revelation. Whatever subsequent acting performance she gave as an adult it was, quite honestly, atrocious in comparison. Child actors are unselfconscious and blessed with monumental confidence and self-belief and the ability to imaginatively project. Some of them lose this when they grow up. Linda Blair certainly did. However, in THE EXORCIST, she was something else entirely.The screenplay by William Peter Blatty is one of the most carefully composed and atmospherically chilling pieces one could imagine. He draws each and every character as a three-dimensional human being and takes time over development. Quite remarkable, considering Blatty had been a hack comedy writer up to this point (he scripted, of all things, the Peter Sellers Inspector Clouseau flick A SHOT IN THE DARK).Friedkin directs each shot with painstaking care and an eye for making the commonplace seem frightful and unsettling. Case in point is the scene when Ellen Burstyn is simply walking home in daylight. Autumn leaves blow along the street, kids trick-or-treating run by, the wind tugs the habits of some passing nuns, and Mike Oldfield's signature loop from Tubular Bells plays in the background. It is really uncannily unnerving. And quite brilliant. Friedkin's choice of this particular music is inspired, but it's used very, very sparingly (only twice?) throughout the movie. Oldfield's piano repeat has a weird hook\/tempo that the listener can never quite get their head around. This is what makes it addictive and unsettling and it gets into your head, stays there and helps set a unique tone.The audio visual tapestry Friedkin weaves builds steadily and seamlessly through a series of escalating events and the tension increases in sympathy. Owen Roizman's cinematography is absolutely magnificent, framing the story in a psychologically affecting range of strikingly beautiful textures and tones. Add the support of some immaculately subtle audio effects, the incredible vocalism of Mercedes McCambridge and some truly shocking but never arbitrary or exploitative sequences, and you have one of the most frightening and emotionally rewarding cinematic experiences ever committed to film.THE EXORCIST is one of those rarest phenomena; like PSYCHO, it's a movie that invokes strong feelings in anyone who sees it by intricately creating an atmosphere that is unrivalled in film. There has never been anything else quite like it. And probably never will be again. It's pure cinema and as such demands and deserves the attention it gets. Scrap the media-generated infamy and see it for what it is.The Blu-Ray print is a thing of impressive beauty &#x96; crisp, clean, fresh and vibrant. The director's cut has a very slight edge over the theatrical release, if only for providing the most complete viewing platform available.

","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"28 October 2013","score":"","review":" If you are a fan of 'extreme' cinema, especially of the French variety, chances are you've already heard of or seen 'Baise Moi', and if you're not, then it probably won't be too high on your list of films to see, if it is at all. Hopefully you know what to expect at least!BM is somewhat like 'Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer', but with a pair of seemingly psychologically 'normal' women, who one day lose it and commit murder on impulse, happen to bump into one another before going postal for a few days before it all unravels tragically at the end.What BM offers that most 'extreme' films don't, is a large proportion of the cast and directors being from the pornographic industry, and of course, actual unsimulated sex scenes. That and the the fact that women are ones committing reckless acts of murder, often in brutal and creative ways, with the sex and the violence interspersed evenly and casually throughout, does serve to earn the film its controversial reputation.A common criticism is the loose storytelling, and yes, the first few scenes are unusual, and very random, snippets of street\/bar scenes, conversations, yet all tinged with a sense of menace. Tension between man and woman is palpable from early on, before any of the characters are properly introduced.The first lead is Nadine, a lady of the night, played by the stunning (and sadly departed) Karen Lancaume, demure and polite in public, super casual at home, where she constantly fends off her bickering housemate. The second is Manu (Rafaella Anderson), younger and gutsier, and actually more believable as a killer or a criminal than Nadine.The manner of their meeting and subsequent bonding is somewhat rushed and artificial. Probably not what the directors wanted to focus on, in preference for getting to the action as soon as possible.The violence will satisfy most extremophiles, it is more of the gritty and realistic variety than the cartoonish gore Kill Bill variety. However, I never truly bought Nadine as a sadistic killer the way I did with Manu. Manu just seems like a dangerous street kid capable of anything, with Nadine it feels she is more just coming along for the ride, and is too jaded about life to care or take much pleasure in the brutality. Her speaking and mannerisms are too sedate and measured, even aloof; I am thinking her first mainstream role should not have been as radical as this. BM finishes with Manu killed, and Nadine forced to deal with her loss, whom she mourns as she would a sister (after only having met her a few days prior). So, not even after so much carnage does she lose her ability to feel, or love, she is finally presented as a tragic character, not a monster. And perhaps, after being used to seeing psychopaths commit these acts on our screens, Nadine's 'human' story adds to BM being so hard to stomach for the censors, given the monstrous acts she previously committed.I know of no other film as violent with frequent unsimulated sex scenes, especially not ones where the murderers and participants in said sex scenes are one and the same! Given that the film is now 13 years old, in the world of extreme, that has to count for something!
