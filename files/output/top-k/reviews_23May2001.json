I made sure that I understood exactly what it was that I liked and disliked about the film before committing it to words.  And here's where I stand.Shrek is funny, no... not just funny.  It is by far the funniest movie out this year.  But it misses its target in a lot of different ways.  Donkey, Shrek's comic sidekick voiced by Eddie Murphy brought me to laughter every time he did anything in the film.  There wasn't a second of silence when Donkey spoke.Then there is Lord Farquaad.  This miserable little man, voiced by John Lithgow, is hilarious.  His tyrade against the fairy tale creatures is unrelenting, and his evil demenour made me double over more than once.And the fairy tale creatures as well, caused constant pain in my side. And I welcome that pain any day.  From Pinochio to the Three Bears, they were all there, and I was glad to see them.I'm sure by now you've noticed that I've left two very important characters out of this commentary.  The first, is Fiona, voiced by Cameron Diaz. The second, is Shrek, voiced by Mike Myers (who is one of my very favorites).These two characters suffered immensly throughout the feature.  Shrek's humour was grotesque, and found only a few times through the course of the movie.  As he approaches Lord Farquaad's castle, accompanied by his friend Donkey, Shrek comments, do you think he's compensating for something? The castle is, of course, huge and some might consider it narrow.  This joke is one of those that are intended to fly over the head of the Jr. audience, and make adults and parents laugh.  Well, I'm sure it flew over the kids heads... but when it got to the adults who were tall enough to catch it, it really wasn't funny.  That was Myers problem throughout the whole movie, he wasn't funny.Fiona, I grant, was not really intended to be funny.  At least I hope not.I think that the first main problem I had with the film was that the romance seemed to be the main point that they were trying to emphasize.  I think they should have subdued it a little more.  Maybe brought in more scenes with the funny faerie-tale-things, for a few more laughs.  Farquaad should have been in it more as well, I think.Overall, it should have been a half hour longer, and not strived for the amount of substance that it did.  The medium is great, but the presentation they were making was for comedy, and not for some dramatic romance... and then the script decided to screw the presentation over.Shrek is good.  I liked it. No, I loved it.  But still, these reservations really stick with me even days after I've seen it.  The combination of the image isn't everything romance and the comedy just didn't mix as well as I had hoped they would.Regardless of that little tyrade, I'm still recommending Shrek to all my friends, and to you as well.  Shrek is a good family movie.  A good date movie.  And a good movie to see with friends.  It's mostly funny, and generally a good time.Go see Shrek.  But don't expect perfection.  Just expect to laugh. ","genre":null},{"date":"23 May 2001","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  I took my time and saw Shrek twice this past weekend.

There is nothing profound in it, but it neatly, and frequently, skewers fairy tale conventions and characters, especially the Disney ones. One has to watch it a couple of times to catch all the spoken jokes, and probably another time to catch all the visual throwaway gags which hang out in the corners of frames. In this regard the movie is clever, well written, and charming in a low sort of way. It is suitable for all ages, even with mildly borderline subject matter in some of the jokes and references. The little kids will not get the 'worst' ones, while the non prudes on the adult audience will laugh heartily.A couple of fine scenes include the one with Geppetto turning over Pinocchio to the fairy-tale-creature bounty hunters for a payment in gold ( I got here a talking puppet!....But I'm a REAL boy! ... Then throw him in the pile with the other possessed toys!), the duet between the princess and the bluebird, right out of at least three Disney classics, in which the princess wins the high note contest while the little bird, well, loses. And finally, a certain gag pulled countless times by Foghorn Leghorn on a certain chained dog is repeated here with a chained dragon...the setup is obvious, then they make you wait ....for...it, then the inevitable 'yipe!'. Great stuff. Did I mention the cat fight between Snow White and  Cinderella?However, being a fan of good computer animation, I was disappointed in the quality of same in Shrek. Many people have commented on how perfect the animation is here, but they either don't know better, or simply are not paying attention. The CGI folks have come up with some software which provides an improvement in the way skin, muscle, fat, etc., move on the skeletons of the characters; it is better than we have seen before. However, the animators apparently never graduated from cheap Saturday morning cartoon level character movement. Almost without exception, the lead characters move like poorly operated marionettes, the secondary characters are worse yet. Almost any Disney classic was far better in this regard. Another problem was patchy and inconsistent interface between the characters and their environments. For example, walking characters often seem to be levitating slightly above the ground, or perhaps they are failing to depress grass under foot, etc. Two fine CGI animated films, Antz and A Bug's Life were made concurrently, by Dreanworks and Pixar, respectively. In Antz, the animators were happy to have ants climbing a flower stem which was stiff, lifeless, and had leaves looking like they were plastic. In an almost identical scene from Bug's Life, the stem and leaves were swaying slightly in the air, the leaves were translucent (like real leaves by golly), and the whole assembly of the plant interacted with realism to the movements, shadows, etc. of the characters. It is this inspired attention to detail which makes Pixar the best CGI studio in the world, and why the Dreamworks crew is still the runner up. If only Pixar had made Shrek.

Negative reviews (from IMDb, FYI) dulled my interests, but finally, I figured what the hell, and as it turned out, this isn't a bad movie.A deep-sea mining crew, counting down to its last few days (well, first, of their project, and later, of their lives--ouch, that was pretty promo-like, huh?) and, seemingly out of nowhere, one of the crew members becomes infected with an odd sort of skin disease, which may lead back to a small, spider-like sea creature brought on board. In any event, things don't look good, and this disease is apparently something more. Something very deadly. This may also explain the sunken Russian ship they find, with the mysterious captain's log and, well...one thing leads to another, and Alien-style fun ensues as members of the small crew are infected or killed (or, in one rather unique case, kill themselves), leading up to a somewhat flat climax, where the film falters.Indeed, we'll start with that. Leviathan has a good amount of build-up. Bores the hell out of some people, but it really isn't boring. (And doesn't take THAT long for the screaming to start, so to speak.) We get to know the characters, and what is going on here, and what is causing this whole fiasco. I, for one, liked that, and liked the way the characters are developed. Peter Weller as the pacifist head honcho, Beck. Richard Crenna as the doctor, Dr. Thompson. Amanda Pays as the requisite tough-but-likably-innocent miner, Willie. Daniel Stern as the slimy Sixpack, and so forth and so on. All in all, a great group of characters. (Loved Ernie Hudson's Jones.) And you don't really want to see them all die. So, when it all goes down, the movie manages to envoke some sympathy for them all.But once it's time to get into action mode (running around steam-filled corridors, toting a flame-thrower, screaming and hollering and all that fun stuff) the movie doesn't deliver. Sure, the final trio of survivors gets to do their fair share of it, and they do it well. But then it just seems like the ending came too quickly, and there was still more to be milked. Let's look at Alien again. (I think it's a prerequisite that anyone who reviews this movie mention that one, too.) In the end, after everyone but Ripley is killed, we get a pretty harrowing thrill ride through the soon-to-be-detonating ship. Sure, it goes to the extent of Ripley going back to get the cat, but it's SCARY! And you're on the edge of your seat the whole time. Here...well, no cat, but the the mining ship was going to implode, due to lack of oxygen. So, what happened to all that drama and suspense? I felt a little cheated. Would have loved to have knocked off the others and left Willie running around doing all that fun stuff, trying to escape before she ran out of air. Instead...well, you get the point.Since we're talking about characters a little, let's move on to the acting. For the most part, the cast gives a good show. Peter Weller is leading man material, and he pulled it off well. Richard Crenna never gives a downright bad performance, and I liked him here. Loved Amanda Pays's British accent, and she gave a good performance. Would have liked her a little bit more gun-ho, though, she seemed to need some saving a little too much. Daniel Stern has a surprisingly smaller role, considering his billing, but he does well with what he has to do. Ernie Hudson is a dependable actor, and you can always trust him to give a great performance. Here, he does it again. I really liked his character, he was probably the one I liked the most of them all. Another great actor is Hector Elizondo, and here he gives another very Hector Elizondo performance, and he does a great job. Lisa Eilbacher also gave a great performance, and I really liked her. Michael Carmine may have seemed a bit like the we'll think of a character later Hispanic, but I thought he did quite well, too. Last but not least, Meg Foster, who actually only appears on a television communicating with Beck (she sent them all down there) and a little bit in the end, but, well...she's got the most amazing eyes I've ever seen, and that's the most I could say for her.The special effects are excellent, and with all this CGI crap we have today, its great to see these genuine effects, and they look great.Overall, the movie isn't bad. It sustains a good amount of suspense in parts, and George P. Cosmatos can handle a swift action scene quite well. Check out Cassandra Crossing (the only other Cosmatos movie I've seen--I'll be sure to check out more), it's very Italian but it's a pretty good 70s disaster flick of his. The Jerry Goldsmith score is good, too. Not The Omen good, but he never fails to give a pretty rousing score.So, in the end, Leviathan ain't bad. Try the much frowned-upon Sphere (I liked it) or The Abyss for similiar fun. Enjoy.

Let's look at Alien again. (I think it's a prerequisite that anyone who reviews this movie mention that one, too.) In the end, after everyone but Ripley is killed, we get a pretty harrowing thrill ride through the soon-to-be-detonating ship. Sure, it goes to the extent of Ripley going back to get the cat, but it's SCARY! And you're on the edge of your seat the whole time. Here...well, no cat, but the the mining ship was going to implode, due to lack of oxygen. So, what happened to all that drama and suspense? I felt a little cheated. Would have loved to have knocked off the others and left Willie running around doing all that fun stuff, trying to escape before she ran out of air. Instead...well, you get the point.Since we're talking about characters a little, let's move on to the acting. For the most part, the cast gives a good show. Peter Weller is leading man material, and he pulled it off well. Richard Crenna never gives a downright bad performance, and I liked him here. Loved Amanda Pays's British accent, and she gave a good performance. Would have liked her a little bit more gun-ho, though, she seemed to need some saving a little too much. Daniel Stern has a surprisingly smaller role, considering his billing, but he does well with what he has to do. Ernie Hudson is a dependable actor, and you can always trust him to give a great performance. Here, he does it again. I really liked his character, he was probably the one I liked the most of them all. Another great actor is Hector Elizondo, and here he gives another very Hector Elizondo performance, and he does a great job. Lisa Eilbacher also gave a great performance, and I really liked her. Michael Carmine may have seemed a bit like the we'll think of a character later Hispanic, but I thought he did quite well, too. Last but not least, Meg Foster, who actually only appears on a television communicating with Beck (she sent them all down there) and a little bit in the end, but, well...she's got the most amazing eyes I've ever seen, and that's the most I could say for her.The special effects are excellent, and with all this CGI crap we have today, its great to see these genuine effects, and they look great.Overall, the movie isn't bad. It sustains a good amount of suspense in parts, and George P. Cosmatos can handle a swift action scene quite well. Check out Cassandra Crossing (the only other Cosmatos movie I've seen--I'll be sure to check out more), it's very Italian but it's a pretty good 70s disaster flick of his. The Jerry Goldsmith score is good, too. Not The Omen good, but he never fails to give a pretty rousing score.So, in the end, Leviathan ain't bad. Try the much frowned-upon Sphere (I liked it) or The Abyss for similiar fun. Enjoy.

Like the $139 million dollar juggernaut that it is, Pearl Harbor roars across the screen as Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett star as best friend aviators. Rafe (Affleck) has to leave his best friend behind when he joins the highly-respected `Eagle Squadron' out of Britain. The Eagles battle the Nazis as America still refuses to enter World War II. Rafe's beloved Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) is a nurse and is just getting  to know her fly-boy when he takes the assignment in Britain. Rafe asks Danny to look after Evelyn if anything should happen to him overseas. Danny is a man of his word. Tragedy brings down one of the three and the pain it causes brings their lives face to face with the horror that is the Japanese sneak attack of Pearl Harbor. That lone event changed the face of the world and America forever. Who will live? Who will die? And strategically, how will America overcome this disaster? There are so many ways to look at this film, that it's hard to narrow it down into one review. I basically see the film as three smaller films brought together as a huge 3-plus hour blockbuster juggernaut. The first film focuses on the love story of the three leads. The second is the actual events that transpire before and during the attack of Pearl Harbor and the third is the aftermath. Each of these sections of this huge film could have been its own actual film. Director Michael Bay really challenges himself a lot in the first hour of this film. The love story, subtle lighting and humor are really like nothing he has accomplished before. These scenes were great in that they show Bay is evolving as a director. I did find however find that the actual `love-story' plot was quite contrived and was an almost typical wartime drama scenario. Bay's CGI effects and rip-roaring attacks, throughout the second hour are amazing and very intense. These scenes are a marvel to witness. But the film seems to drag quite a bit as the attack dies down. The whole third hour seems like a sequel. Why didn't  screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) find a way to conclude the lead characters' story in the events of Pearl Harbor? Wallace's script had too much meat and did tend to flip-flop to a lot of different people not around Pearl Harbor. The script should have summed up the love-story in the first 20 minutes, trimmed down some of the flip-flops and narrowed the focus of the film to the actual events of Pearl Harbor. If this would have occurred the film wouldn't have been so long.The lead actors are dashing, daring, beautiful and wonderful to watch. Affleck is good as the steel-hearted hero who faces a moral dilemma. Harnett is believable as the guy who falls for his best friend's girl. But of the three, Beckinsale seemed to release the most range as she seemed to be the one tortured the most. I really liked her during the hospital sequences when the siege was happening. These blurred moments reflect the stress both within Beckinsale and in the events occurring. I really liked this technique. My overall favorite performance wasn't even by one of the main leads. Jon Voight's performance as Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Voight's grasping of the classic historical figure was incredible and it's amazing how he even resembles America's greatest president. I loved this performance and I do hope there is an Oscar nod here. Pearl Harbor's historical lay-out and  formula kind of reminded me of was how the mini-series `The Winds of War' was a set-up for `War & Remembrance' except they were two long and massive mini-series. Pearl Harbor may have included too much stuff in its story. The whole first hour could have been vastly trimmed to bring the actual event closer to the front of the film. `The Winds of War' and its sequel were the most ambitious complete World War II dramas ever conceived. Pearl Harbor may have been too ambitious. This American interpretation of the Japanese invasion is very respectful to the Japanese and doesn't show them as tyrants. I liked that the Japanese were perceived as doing a strategic thing and that they knew that they were awakening a sleeping giant. I am not sure if this is actually the correct portrayal of Japan during this time period but it definitely won't harm anybody today. Pearl Harbor is the kind of film that is meaty enough to spend those inflated theatre ticket prices on. It has something for everyone. (4 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.

I was none too excited about seeing this for that exact reason, and while the film has much going for it, I got what I expected another snack from the Hollywood cookie cutter.  (This review will not be a rant on how great independent films are; frankly many of those bore me.) First the good  Morgan Freeman, of course always turns in a good believable performance.  I'm not a huge fan, but I have a lot of respect for his work.  It's a well-directed film with a good slick look (except for a truly awful CGI car crash) and most of the cast is good as well, with Michael Wincott (who should be in more movies) giving us a creepy villain.

To be quite frank, if I wrote a series of novels about a secret agent or a mercenary, and some producer had a man like Roger Moore portraying the character in any of the resultant films, I would disown those episodes of the film franchise. I'd make no secret of it, either.So where do I begin with Roger Moore? Well, for one thing, I find him about as believeable in the role of a secret agent as I find Denise Richards in the role of a nuclear scientist. It just doesn't work. I've met a number of individuals whom I would not be surprised to hear of working for MI6 or the CIA (or as free agents a la Ronin), and none of them get themselves confused with Hugh Hefner. In comparison to Sean Connery's dry, earthy humour and George Lazenby's tragic Romeo-like performance in a doomed romance, Moore has little of interest to offer. His rating as a Bond is further weakened by comparisons to the aggressive humanity that Timothy Dalton brought to the role, or the smooth professionalism that has become Pierce Brosnan's trademark (he is so far the only Bond actor I'd believe in the role of an assassin or secret agent). Thus, a rut was fallen into during the Bonds from 1973 to 1985 the same old boring sex jokes repeated over and over and over. If anyone believes for a second that anyone living in England, other than those in serious positions of power that is, during the 1970s and 1980s behaved like this, then I have a bridge I'd like to sell you.Maybe I expect too much from films, but when I ask to be entertained, I expect something refined and intelligent. Moore's films have neither of those things. Instead, they just have more women draping themselves around the sets, trying to make up for the lack of story with their sex appeal. The story here, such as it is, had something to do with James Bond investigating the illegal business activities of a heroin baron known as Mr. Big. This is the kind of plot I'd expect to see in an episode of The Bill, not an entry into the James Bond franchise. Think about what's happened in earlier episodes Bond has so far stopped plots to irradiate all the gold in Fort Knox (Goldfinger), to render whole strains of crops sterile (On Her Majesty's Secret Service), and a large-scale diamond smuggling operation (Diamonds Are Forever), to name the examples I am more familiar with. Since Moore's awful tenure, he's gone renegade to avenge a friend (Licence To Kill), and stopped a plot to destroy every electronic circuit in England (GoldenEye), just to name two. So why on Earth are we leaving this small-time garbage for Bond to clean up?My last comment relates to the usual correlation between the quality of Bond theme songs and the films that they are from. On Her Majesty's Secret Service and GoldenEye have the two best Bond themes ever, and not surprisingly, they are the best Bonds of all time simply because they add some much-needed depth to the character. Tomorrow Never Dies has one of the worst Bond themes in existence, and it is a very poor effort in spite of a heroic effort from Brosnan. Live And Let Die, on the other hand, is an exception. Paul McCartney has much more compositional talent than his tenure with the Beatles ever let on, and the Live And Let Die theme is a perfect example of this. It's hard to squeeze much musical ability into a two-minute song, but it works here. Unfortunately, this is all that can be said for this beginning of a real dark age for the Bond franchise.

Apparently it's very simple  just a few fundamental character and plot misfires, and voila!  Unfunny comic gold!Joe Dirt is perhaps the saddest sack in America.  A hopelessly out-of-touch piece of poor white trash, Joe favors acid-washed jeans, hair-band T-shirts with cut-off sleeves, and a fluffy mullet wig (it covers an exposed brain pan, and he's been wearing it since he was a baby).  He is currently a janitor at an L.A. radio station, but this is just the latest pit-stop on a sprawling, country-wide search for his parents, who abandoned him at the Grand Canyon when he was eight years old.  During his quixotic travels, Joe befriends a Native American fireworks merchant (Adam Beach), almost becomes a mass murderer's latest victim, becomes an American cult hero, and gets a lot of crap dumped all over his overblown hairdo.  Literally.Good raw material for a comedy here.  From the good-natured Hee Haw, the foibles of backwards white America have been a great source of humor for years, and from the first scene, with Spade tooling down Sunset in his ugly two-tone beater, waving at chicks and totally oblivious to his own ridiculousness, Joe Dirt seems to be gearing up to give us a rootin'-tootin' time.But then what happens?  As little Joe goes on his search for his folks, he is constantly set upon by bullies who beat him up, pick on his clothes, and generally treat him like a loser.  He pines pathetically for a ripe young country lass (Brittany Daniel), sulks over the miserable lot he has been left by his abandonment, and at one point even contemplates suicide.  In other words, we're supposed to take this guy SERIOUSLY.  We're supposed to (shudder) CARE about him!  Gordon, Spade, and Wolf are clearly hoping we'll be inspired by the way Joe rallies against all of his obstacles, both self-generated and imposed on him by his sorry circumstances, and cheered by his ability to elevate himself above his station and become a true man of honor.WRONG!  We want to watch this clownish loser to fail!  We would ENJOY it! Or we could, if the filmmakers had gone the right way with the character. The central problem with Joe Dirt is that Joe seems to be ASHAMED of who he is.  He knows he's a loser, he realizes he's ridiculous.  It's not funny to watch a clown who knows he's a clown; it's like he's sitting in the audience with us, shaking his head at his own pathetic state.Think for a moment about the rollicking, rip-roaring comedy that Joe Dirt could have been if the filmmakers had pushed their instincts in the opposite direction.  Imagine Joe even more comically grotesque  play up the white-trash stuff more, the incessant reading of Auto Trader magazine, the intimations of incest, the love of gaudy '80s hair metal.  What's more, make him absolutely, utterly IN LOVE WITH HIMSELF.  In love with his crappy car, in love with his grotesque sideburns, in love with his low taste in all things.  Who needs a character who thinks he's as pathetic as we do?  It would be much more fun to watch an UNREPETANT ridiculous loser maniac.  As last year's Me Myself & Irene already proved, it's virtually impossible to make a comedy in which we're supposed to laugh with contempt at characters we are later meant to take seriously and (gag!) care about.I don't care if Joe finds his parents.  I don't want to see him getting his scrawny butt kicked by liquored-up country boys.  I don't even want to see him in the country, period!

A beat-up Marshall amp instead of a living room chair!  Heck, make his dad a Klansman!  Go nuts!  Make us HATE this guy!  Then we'll laugh at everything you heap on him!  Then he's really a loser, and we can LOVE him being a loser, instead of wanting him to win.

The reason Dumb and Dumber was one of the funniest films of recent years is because Peter and Bobby Farrelly did not sell out their characters by ever making us take them seriously; the integrity of their idiocy was maintained to the last frame, and we were able to laugh loud and long as they constantly shot their own legs out from under themselves.  Sadly, as Irene indicates, it's a lesson they have forgotten, and Joe Dirt represents just another film that follows suit, another picture with the right idea and the wrong execution.Admittedly, Joe Dirt has one great moment, a sight gag that made me laugh so loud I was ashamed of myself (granted, this may be because I was the only person in the theatre who laughed).  In making up fliers to inquire about his parents, Joe describes them rather badly to the sketch artist.  The result  his mother's drawing looks like exactly like the Night Stalker, Richard Ramirez, complete with pentagram on her palm.  This joke comes completely out of the blue, and has a gratifyingly nasty charge sorely lacking from the rest of Joe Dirt.

As last year's Me Myself & Irene already proved, it's virtually impossible to make a comedy in which we're supposed to laugh with contempt at characters we are later meant to take seriously and (gag!) care about.I don't care if Joe finds his parents.  I don't want to see him getting his scrawny butt kicked by liquored-up country boys.  I don't even want to see him in the country, period!  Put him in the CITY, where he's a one-of-a-kind specimen, where he can really do some damage.  Have him be the one kicking butt!  Don't wimp out on the incest jokes!  Crystal meth in the basement! A beat-up Marshall amp instead of a living room chair!  Heck, make his dad a Klansman!  Go nuts!  Make us HATE this guy!  Then we'll laugh at everything you heap on him!  Then he's really a loser, and we can LOVE him being a loser, instead of wanting him to win.  Then I'd laugh.I don't mean to get so fired up over this, but I see comedy after comedy doing this, trying to get us to laugh at a character we're later supposed to spin around and root for.  The reason Dumb and Dumber was one of the funniest films of recent years is because Peter and Bobby Farrelly did not sell out their characters by ever making us take them seriously; the integrity of their idiocy was maintained to the last frame, and we were able to laugh loud and long as they constantly shot their own legs out from under themselves.  Sadly, as Irene indicates, it's a lesson they have forgotten, and Joe Dirt represents just another film that follows suit, another picture with the right idea and the wrong execution.Admittedly, Joe Dirt has one great moment, a sight gag that made me laugh so loud I was ashamed of myself (granted, this may be because I was the only person in the theatre who laughed).  In making up fliers to inquire about his parents, Joe describes them rather badly to the sketch artist.  The result  his mother's drawing looks like exactly like the Night Stalker, Richard Ramirez, complete with pentagram on her palm.  This joke comes completely out of the blue, and has a gratifyingly nasty charge sorely lacking from the rest of Joe Dirt.  And now that you know the money gag, go rent Dumb and Dumber again instead of shelling out seven bucks for this dud.  Comedy is nothing if it lacks the courage of its convictions.

This kind of movie is what European cinema needs to convince the European public and investors not all quality non-arthouse movies come out of Hollywood. Don't get me wrong, my top-10 movies still are mostly American and I'm not on a Hollywood-bashing rage here, but Pacte des Loups (which should've been called Wolfpact in English if you ask me, just see the movie) is the kind of movie that restores some lost confidence.It's exciting, good-looking, engaging and professional. OK, so maybe some of the effects look a little 'vintage', it's not like it's the end of the world and by the time that kind of effect is needed, most of the suspense has already done its unnerving work.The movie makes great use of close-ups, slow-motion (or variable-motion really) coloring, it has some beautifully directed shots, believable scenery and I'd put it up there with other recent martial arts\/(fantasy\/sf) combinations like (I know...) 'The Matrix' and 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon'. Since those two came out before PdL it loses some points in originality, but I definitely like the story better than Crouching Tiger and I think it takes a lot more work to create a believable medieval actionflic than a sf computer-generated universe, so I don't think Le Pacte des Loups is redundant in that respect.Finally, the good sense of Gothic atmosphere holds well. It only loses some of it's force at some points in the movie where the director couldn't resist showing the viewer how things really are\/look and at a few points where some characters feel the need to 'explain themselves' to each other.

Baz Luhrmann's film Moulin Rouge far exceeded any expectations I had, negative or positive, and was a truly magical and beautiful cinematic experience.

All too often films try too hard to do one or the other to extremes, but once in a while a film comes along and does them both, splendidly. Moulin Rouge is one such film. The story in Moulin Rouge takes the tried and true narrative path of the innocent love story, between the coveted and gorgeous courtesan, 'Satine' (Nicole Kidman) and young naive writer 'Christian' (Ewan Macgregor). The plot centers on these two characters' struggle to practice their love, which is forbidden for a variety of reasons.  The most pressing obstacle to their love is the 'evil' (read classic slimey Hollywood bad guy character) Duke of Monroth, played hilariously by the talented Richard Roxburgh.  Without giving too much of the story away, the Duke's character puts the young lovers in a decidedly tough position and ultimately puts their love to the test.

This film is very thought provoking and well done and Ryder and Jolie are an amazing duo. Brittany Murphy was also powerful as Daisy. This film is a 9 out of 10. Excellent.

It was well worth waiting for...the action was relentless, the scenes imaginatively and sensitively filmed - so close at times that I felt I was there taking part. Although some of the storyline seemed  contrived - stranger things happen in real life... It was back to old-fashioned entertainment, where the love scenes are romantic. The smoulder in Ardeth Bay's eyes alone is worth the admission fee. He is undoubtedly the sexiest actor on screen and is headed for a VERY exiting future in movies of all types. It's the type of film you could easily see again and again - just to fill in any blanks that may have been missed first time round! Can't wait till its out on video. Can't say that the Scorpion King prequel fills me with the same anticipation - would like the next film to further develop the characters of the O'Connels, Jonathon, and Ardeth Bay and develop laterally with other aspects of Egypt being brought out - perhaps tied up in a pre and during WWII era?... All in all I thought this film was a wonderful example of escapism, and I came out smiling...it made me feel really good!
