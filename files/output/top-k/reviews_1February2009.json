[{"date":"1 February 2009","score":"","review":" As the title of my comment suggests, I'm arguing the case that The Matrix (trilogy) is the best superhero movie(s) ever made (so far!). Lots of people claim the trilogy should have stopped after the first movie, that the sequels were somewhat self-indulgent, over-complicated and not necessary. I watched all three films recently, back-to-back, and the story makes absolute sense, I can't help but feel that due to the large gap between the films (well, the first and second) people maybe lost the overall picture. That being said, each to their own, I just feel that the trilogy is complete, enthralling and narratively exceptional.My first point that this is a 'superhero' movie may be somewhat controversial, since Neo has no 'superhero powers' - but then again, neither does Batman and that's considered to be in the same genre of those movies containing characters with a biological or physiological advantage. Now, at the end of the first film we see that Neo can fly, in subsequent films we see he can dodge bullets, in fact he can stop them in mid-air. These are super powers, but they only exist inside The Matrix (well, until the last film when he gets stuck in the Matrix, and also acquires a sixth sense where he can visualise his surroundings in terms of light). In a way it's a bit like Superman's powers, he's only a 'superhero' under the Earth's sun; Neo's only a superhero inside the matrix (I know there's complications in the Third film where Smith comes into the human world, and Neo remains in the Matrix without being 'jacked-in'). Much like the Harry Potter franchise, I won't give anything away for those who haven't read the books, but the idea of a hero and anti-hero being 'somehow connected', inevitably leads to a thrilling conclusion.So, what have the films got that make them so exceptional. Well, they cross so many genres whilst (maybe it's just the 'greenness' of the shots) creating their own brand. Firstly we have space travel, albeit not technically in space (well, not at all actually) in huge hunking piles of junk (remember the Millennium Falcon, anybody?) with a cocky pilot (Narobi = Han Solo). Secondly, we have pirates! The definition of a ship 'space ship or otherwise', Morpheus being the William Shatner of the Matrix Enterprise (haha, OK I made that up - but you know what I mean).We also have the critical point to any successful sci-fi franchise, obviously 'the one' e.g. Annakin Skywalker in the Star Wars series, we have somebody who possesses something which nobody else has ('bringing balance to the force anyone' p).Anyway, comparisons aside. My main point, as I run out of time is the argument why this is the BEST superhero franchise ever made. And I will conclude by explaining my viewpoint. If we look at the Spider-man trilogy, most critics (and even die hard fans agree) that by the third installment with the preposterous transformation of Peter Parker into a kind of emo-rock god mid-way through the film was laughable, and the inclusion of three villains merely muddled the whole film. The Matrix, however, manages to surpass this by maintaining the villains from the very start to the very end. Technically there's two villains. Agent Smith (although he's managed to make about a trillion of himself) and 'the robots' (represented throughout by Sentinels, or the agents inside the film) but really (much like many good video games) the actual villain is the 'final boss' and a fantastic amalgamation of fortune whereby neither villain is mutually exclusive. The consistency of the main villain(s) whilst throwing in a few more relatively insignificant characters for food for thought (such as the Maravinji (I don't know the spelling), or the two identical twins, or Reagen in the first film) whilst adding to the story, not confusing things.To conclude, this movie differs from all the others by killing the superhero. To show that goodness may not always prevail from a personal sense (Neo loses Trinity) but powers or gifts can be used for larger effect. This is the first film to mind, that the hero sacrifices himself for the benefit of his species. I'm sure most people will recognise the somewhat religious\/philosophical element of the hero who dies for his people. Also, the ending isn't exactly perfect, it's not all rosy, the humans aren't free, they're just spared their city, for the time being, thanks to Neo (the Architects speech, humorously flowered with complicated terminology to represent a high intelligence explains how this is all part of the plan - e.g. the creation of Neo occurs due an unsolved equation to iron out the imperfections of the Matrix). If this is true, Neo's part, and death, really hasn't changed much, but it has saved those individuals in the immediate present. In a rather depressing twist, the claims of the Architect that this is, in the words Heath Ledger's joker, 'All part of the plan', makes the struggle of Neo and all his loss, seem worthless. But throughout the movie, human emotions are referred to, e.g. love, hope, emotions that robots can't seem to fathom. And it is this love, sacrifice and display of the fundamental make-up of being human, makes us think that the Architect maybe hasn't quite got it all as worked out as he thinks.Also, I must add (and I'd be naive if I wasn't to mention) the importance of 'choice'. The clear cut different of having a 'purpose' and choosing to live our own lives. Also, I must mention the train station scene, which suggests that programs of the Matrix may be, themselves, 'evolving' ('I, Robot' anyone?) suggesting that this time, the system, despite the Architects best efforts, may be waking up and escaping, you guessed it, 'control'.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"1 February 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" In complete opposite mentality of Taxi Driver, no one challenges things anymore. If a movie wins a few Oscars and is labeled as a classic, the title sticks and everyone must bow down to it. If someone challenges this title&#151;even so much as asks, Why is it a classic?&#151;they're ironically turned into a laughable fool by fools laughing. The paradoxical problem with this is that no one can really defend the so-called classics. All you ever hear in the defense of films like Taxi Driver when criticism arises is a list of the film's awards, or a list of the film's critical acclaim, or just, It's a classic, so shut up! There have been far more original, thought-provoking, well-made movies that never even get the public's attention, much less won overrated Oscars. When people challenge the so-called classics with this fact, the notion is never entertained, and oftentimes foolishly laughed at or stupidly dismissed as childish or immature. With everything I just said as a backbone, I'm about to challenge the classic Taxi Driver. If you're open-minded you'll give this review a chance. If you have the arrogant mentality of a whiney 4-year-old&#151;It's a classic, that's all there is to it!&#151;then don't even bother reading any further. There is no hope for your immature intellect.First and foremost, Taxi Driver is not a completely worthless film. I'm not even going to try to argue that. It has had had a major influence on the way open-world movies and video games have been made, and possibly even invented the subgenre. Taxi Driver creates a realistic world, fills it with faceless scum characters, and openly lets the main character interact with them in a completely non-linear way. Some people find this completely boring, others find it completely genius. The entire film is hinged on if or if not you can emotionally relate to the main character. If so, these opening scenes of him interacting with his environment will likely captivate you. If not, these scenes will likely put you to sleep&#151;every single time you attempt to watch it. Stating and argument on whether or not Taxi Driver is boring or not is completely pointless because it's completely opinion-based. Personally, however, I was bored out of my godforsaken mind until the last thirty minutes of the film. Movies have presented loneliness much better, in much more effective ways than this. Another 70s film, Straw Dogs, for example, examines realistic human emotion with much more depth.DeNiro's acting is average at best, unless you're really studying so closely it's ridicules. If DeNiro wasn't so famous, no one, not a single review, would even mention his acting whatsoever. The character he plays is also completely average.

The paradoxical problem with this is that no one can really defend the so-called classics. All you ever hear in the defense of films like Taxi Driver when criticism arises is a list of the film's awards, or a list of the film's critical acclaim, or just, It's a classic, so shut up! There have been far more original, thought-provoking, well-made movies that never even get the public's attention, much less won overrated Oscars. When people challenge the so-called classics with this fact, the notion is never entertained, and oftentimes foolishly laughed at or stupidly dismissed as childish or immature. With everything I just said as a backbone, I'm about to challenge the classic Taxi Driver. If you're open-minded you'll give this review a chance. If you have the arrogant mentality of a whiney 4-year-old&#151;It's a classic, that's all there is to it!&#151;then don't even bother reading any further. There is no hope for your immature intellect.First and foremost, Taxi Driver is not a completely worthless film. I'm not even going to try to argue that. It has had had a major influence on the way open-world movies and video games have been made, and possibly even invented the subgenre. Taxi Driver creates a realistic world, fills it with faceless scum characters, and openly lets the main character interact with them in a completely non-linear way. Some people find this completely boring, others find it completely genius. The entire film is hinged on if or if not you can emotionally relate to the main character. If so, these opening scenes of him interacting with his environment will likely captivate you. If not, these scenes will likely put you to sleep&#151;every single time you attempt to watch it. Stating and argument on whether or not Taxi Driver is boring or not is completely pointless because it's completely opinion-based. Personally, however, I was bored out of my godforsaken mind until the last thirty minutes of the film. Movies have presented loneliness much better, in much more effective ways than this. Another 70s film, Straw Dogs, for example, examines realistic human emotion with much more depth.DeNiro's acting is average at best, unless you're really studying so closely it's ridicules. If DeNiro wasn't so famous, no one, not a single review, would even mention his acting whatsoever. The character he plays is also completely average.

Adrenaline junkies should find this a pretty good fix for their movie going high, still holding up well even after a couple of decades. The film does a decent job of expanding on the Alien mythos begun in the first film, where even a serious attention to detail fails to reveal what the true life cycle of the species might actually be. Not that all those questions are answered here, in fact there might even be a few more loose ends left by the time it's all over, but by then you're content enough just to catch your breath after a wild thrill ride. The strange thing is that essentially, Aliens is pretty much a re-telling of the original story with enough alteration of significant plot points that you don't really notice it until well after the film is over. The whole story revolves around a brave female (Sigourney Weaver) returning to a planet (LV-426) that has lost contact with civilization due to an unknown calamity. Ripley leads a team of crew members on a hunt against an implacable and dangerous creature that winds up wiping out that entire crew, before it's finally defeated in a last ditch battle before being cast into the vacuum of space. In neither instance did it seem remotely plausible to me that a human could have survived the crushing forces of wind shear better than the much larger and stronger enemy, but one gets so caught up in the fever pitch emotion of good vs. evil that it doesn't really matter too much. We just want to see Ripley kick some monster a--!What kind of gets lost in translation are some of the cool elements that form the back story of LV-426, a terra-formed 'shake and bake' space colony complete with it's own atmosphere processor. Those elements are only mentioned very quickly in passing, as is the nature of the unit dispatched to investigate the planet. The term Colonial Marines is only used once in the picture, but followers of the Alien saga know the term well, as they show up in any number of book and graphic novel treatments. It wouldn't be too far off the mark to say that they embody the typical fan boy concept of over the top universal soldier types complete with wise cracking banter and big guns,.... really, really big guns. But you know, I didn't hear anyone say 'Lock and Load' - or maybe I missed it.There was even the inclusion of an android again, or as Bishop (Lance Henricksen) explained, an artificial person, a synthetic. I guess that shouldn't have surprised anyone, since the first picture established the science officer as an artificial life form. Still, the dismemberment of Bishop was much too reminiscent of Ash's demise to be original, there was just a little more of him at the end to make the save for Newt (Carrie Henn). I like Henricksen though, so I won't hold the script against him.What was unnerving on a repeat viewing today was the role of Carter Burke as played by Paul Reiser. His portrayal worked for me back in 1986, but all I could think of now was 'Mad About You's Paul Buchman trying to be the bad guy and it just doesn't work. But you'll be OK if you don't think 'Helen Hunt's husband'. So on balance, a nice pair of thumbs up for Aliens, a sequel that not only carries on the story from it's prequel, but actually enhances it. As the series progressed of course, the same can't be said, but we'll save that for another review.

It is a nice criminal detective comedy since all ends well that had started very grimly and so bad. If we take this film like all films by Hitchcock should be taken, that is to say as a metaphor of real life, of history, of fate, then we might be less surprised by the date. After all the worst is gone, is behind. The war is finished, the second world war and the Korean war, and even McCarthy is dead and buried, politically I mean. We can breathe. The future is clear. The complications are all behind. We are finally getting out of this dark hole in which we had been buried for a long time. The famous post war thirty glorious years and its baby boom generation are starting to bring in the fruit of our suffering, sweating and efforts if not travail. What we have produced is being bought by some millionaire. Our work is recognized and valorized. We are going to be famous, great, rich, beautiful, who knows what else. So we can bury the past. We can un-bury it, and then bury it again, and eventually un-bury it a second time, but why not re-bury that poor past in order to finally get it out once more and discover it was not so bad and it was nothing but some kind of sad heart disease, a disease of the heart, a weak heart crushed by passions, love passion, dreams that me made into nightmares, and maybe some anger. But the film is surprising because Hitchcock manages to have absolutely no staircase, no flights of steps, with or without mezzanines, and yet don't believe me that easy because it is not flat country indeed. And so up they go and down they go, the roads and the tramps, and all the other people in that village, uphill and downhill, upstage and downstage, upriver and downriver, up the strokes and down the strokes to paint and paint and paint reality till no one recognizes it or sees it. And if it were not enough to constantly go up and down lanes and paths and trails and tracks, you go up and down into and out of the ground, you dig out and fill up and dig in and refill up and dig out again and fill up a third time and dig up this time and fill down for the last time. All that vertical movement around a man who is dead and lying horizontal in the middle of the auburn and russet leaves of the fall. Hitchcock is still with us. And he is all the more with us because he explores the psyche of the human species. When they meet with death, their first reaction is to feel guilty for a crime they assume at once they have committed. Paranoid species. Then they feel relieved because someone else assumes the crime they have committed till they feel guilty again and reveal their own doing in the crime. Neurotic, psychotic and schizophrenic, all in one same species. But then they try to forget and wipe it out to go on with the present and their lives. But that is to no avail because life is stronger than illusions and death is even stronger than life. So the crime comes back because it has to be brought out and registered for the life of the living to be able to go on. And it is then that it is all revealed that human beings are as dumb as my thumb and instead of having thought and thought again and pondered, they jumped to conclusions without even thinking one second. And it is the crazy doctor who trips on cadavers all the time and beg their pardons for having disturbed them who finds out all that death was natural and the hullabaloo was nothing but a mid summer night's dream in the middle of the fall. In other words Hitchcock is questioning us on the real value of life when death is no longer a crime. There seems to be little left in life if that is the case.

And it is the crazy doctor who trips on cadavers all the time and beg their pardons for having disturbed them who finds out all that death was natural and the hullabaloo was nothing but a mid summer night's dream in the middle of the fall. In other words Hitchcock is questioning us on the real value of life when death is no longer a crime. There seems to be little left in life if that is the case. Crime and murder are the real spices of life which is so banal and tasteless otherwise.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines ","genre":"Comedy, Mystery"},{"date":"1 February 2009","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Comfort you ask?

It is a bit dated and 'stagey' in its opening minutes, partly because it is taken from the play, not the novel, by John Steinbeck, and also because so many of the outstanding cast were only making their second or third film, and needed warming up and getting used to the camera. Once into its stride, however, this classic tale progresses with relentless fatality to explore all the sadness of loners and drifters with such heart-breaking intensity that it really gets you at gut level. In a sense, the loneliness, impossible dreams, and searing heartaches of the many drifting, unfulfilled, and lost characters are the real heart of this story, which thus embodies the pain of the Depression in the personal lives of several people who suffer, suffer, and, well, suffer. The main storyline is the touching relationship of the retarded giant Lennie, played by Lon Chaney, Junior, and his friend who travels and works with him, and looks after him like a zealously protective brother, played by the young Burgess Meredith. Although Chaney over-acts, he over-acts consistently, which is the secret of over-acting successfully. The result is that Chaney's character achieves full pathos, despite not being a particularly subtle performance. Chaney is no restrained and measured Dustin Hoffmann, and when he is playing someone retarded, he flaunts it, and blurts it. But we accept that. He is the gentle giant who crushes all the little rabbits and puppies he loves because he can never understand his own strength, and his pathetic efforts to remember the simplest things are totally convincing. Burgess Meredith, near the beginning of his film career, gives one the finest of his many inspired performances, showing a shining power of love and devotion rarely seen on the screen with a male character, or someone who is neither father nor mother. Betty Field, also starting out on the screen, is superb as the young wife on the ranch tormented by boredom almost to the point of insanity. The scene where she and the retarded Lennie sit and 'converse', never really connecting but each pursuing a desperate individual monologue, is one of the most effective scenes of its kind ever filmed. This film contains so many moving performances that it is like a showcase of pathos. Roman Bohnen, astonishingly aged only 45 at the time (and he died aged only 54! - a great loss!), plays a pathetic old man desperately attempting to grasp a last thread of a possible dream, having had the only love of his life, an old dog, torn from him and shot, so that he is deprived of anything and everything, stripped bare, a naked, lost soul, as so many in this story are lost souls. Leigh Whipper is outstandingly subtle in his portrayal of an ostracised black worker who mixes bitterness, sympathy, love, hate, and venom all in one well-rounded package, an incredible achievement in a short time on screen. Bob Steele is totally convincing as the repellent young husband of Betty Field, whose manic jealousy and general paranoia rise steadily to a crescendo of intensity. This is a desperate film about desperate people. The relationship of the hopelessly retarded Chaney with his friend Meredith is completely convincing, and heart-breaking to the ultimate degree. One hopes that some of these characters can achieve some semblance of a dream, that even one of them can escape the endless wheel of torment and emotional deprivation and lack of fulfillment. I have known people who resembled these more than is comfortable. This multiply tragic tale is not just devastatingly close to the bone, it is the bone.

What it is about, is the battle over ourselves.Who better than to display these wild but common complexities within people than Edward Norton. The range he shows here is astounding in only his fifth movie.

When he comes out of jail he attempts to stop his brother played Edward Furlong from going down the same road he had done. Through all his efforts though some things just prove to be inevitable. Avery Brooks also gives a great performance as Derek Vinyard's former teacher and now principal of his former school. His words may not be of the most inspiring but his actions and messages sent across are subtle yet strong and to the point.Norton's performance though wasn't just about range but exploring different dimensions of life.

Fergus survives and goes to England where he meets Jody's girl friend Dil, and falls in love with her. Fergus hides the secret of his past and his connection to Dil's former lover while Dil hides a big secret from him.A big portion of the movie revolves around a twist. If you know anything about movies you know what it is. In this internet age nothing is unknown. If you have two function eyes you can figure it out. I wont ruin that twist. There may be someone out there who doesn't know it.Most of the movie is devoted the love story. I never felt a chemistry between Fergus and Dil. Dil is not a character I rooted for. I didn't think Dil was very interesting. Her obvious secret once uncovered makes her quite boring. The surviving IRA agents come back and find Fergus in England. This should have added a little juice to the story, but it didn't. I never found a reason to care about the story.The performances are solid all around, not counting Stephen Rea as Fergus. His performance felt lazy. Oscar winner Forrest Whitaker is sensational although he only appears in the first act. The Jody character has a habit of staying with you even after he's gone. The best performance comes from the actor playing Dil. I can see why the big secret stayed so secret it was because the performance was so convincing.I personally hate twist endings.

His performance felt lazy. Oscar winner Forrest Whitaker is sensational although he only appears in the first act. The Jody character has a habit of staying with you even after he's gone. The best performance comes from the actor playing Dil. I can see why the big secret stayed so secret it was because the performance was so convincing.I personally hate twist endings. Most of the time there only done for shock value. This movie was one of those times. It was totally unnecessary and served very little purpose. Outside of the big twist the movie is not that great.

There was no need to destroy the man further after losing Tadgh to the Tinker girl and pushing away his wife's one last attempt at reconciliation. Nothing was gained artistically in my view, and that part of the plot made little sense.For example, the body of the American was picked up from a lake just outside Bull's house (the image of the American hanging from the hook and the echo with Shamey's hanging brilliantly suggests all the guilt Bull must be feeling). Along with the donkey's carcass even if it's not proof Bull did the murder, he should have been held for questioning given everything else. Instead, he is allowed to freely walk around and get himself into further trouble.Little things also got in the way for me. For one, the field was just too small, both to support Bull or to support a mill to grind limestone into roadbed. The herd of Bull's cattle he was driving at the end was just too large for the field to feed, and no single man on foot could have driven them a long distance over rocky ground to the edge of a cliff (not to mention previous scenes had shown the path between the field and the sea did not go through the village). Nobody who had ever grown up around cattle such as Tadgh would ever think to get in front of a stampede, even in grief.

It just isn't done unless you are suicidal and I don't think Tadgh was at that point.

This movie was about a bunch of people who wanted to race in the Cannonball Run a Race that went from New York to California and the first one to stamp there card wins the prize. Let's start with the drivers as they arrived at the hotel where the Cannonball Race will stat. There's Marcie Thatcher and Jill Rivers riding around the highways going 220 MPH and spraying traffic and speed limit signs. Then you got JJ McClure and Victor who are also in this race. Victor and JJ are trying to figure out what kind of vehicle they need to win this race. So JJ can think first they go riding in an airplane, landing the in the middle of town in order to get beer. Next they go boat riding, only to crash and both JJ and Victor and up in an ambulance. JJ asks the doctor how far away is the hospital and he was told about 15 miles. But they were also told it would only take 5 minutes because with an ambulance you can go in and out of traffic with no one bothering to stop you. So they look at each other and laugh as they continue to fly through traffic. Next you got Jamie Blake and Morris Fendebaum who are dress like priest but they sure don't act like one. So everyone one is at the hotel having a party the night before the race starts. That's when JJ discovers Pamela Glover a very young and beautiful girl who happens to like trees. As JJ is trying to talk to Pamela he is interrupted by Victor who wants to talk about the doctor. JJ tells Victor that they need a doctor to ride in the ambulance so right before the race starts Victor finds Doctor Nikolas Van Helsing but JJ doesn't want to know where in found this doctor. So while the race has started, and JJ realizes that that they don't have a patient for in back of the ambulance. So as there going down the road they come upon and accident where Pamela Glover is standing when JJ and Victor pull up. Pamela ask if they will help the young man and so JJ opens the door, get Pamela Glover inside and Victor takes of leaving the man behind. As there going down the highway a New Jersey State Trooper has his lights on stopping the ambulance. Inside the doctor has given Pamela laughing gas to make it look like she really sick. The girls had a few tricks of the own. You see they would go down the states highways like a bat out of hell only to get pulled over by State Troopers. They were both wearing one piece suits so they open up the zipper show a little and the State Troopers would let them go every time. Who wins this race? Where does Captain Chaos come into play? How many of them get caught and don't finish the race? Here are some thoughts of my own on this movie. I thought the plot and the comedy of this movie was great from beginning to end. However, I bought this movie because of Adrienne Barbeau and Tara Buckman and I sure once disappointed. They walked around in those tight spandex and they were looking real good.

As their careers have progressed, the Coen Brothers have become more successful and acclaimed but their films have lost a little bit of their pizazz, their joie de vivre. Check out this, their second movie, which is just a joy from start to finish; a smorgasbord of hilarious lines, funny off-the-wall performances, crazy antics, breathtaking film-making and sweet, good-natured sentimentality. The movie has several amazing sequences (the eleven minute montage opening, the dream of Lenny, H.I.'s goodbye note, the vision of the future), but the whole story blends into a beautiful little tale of comic folly, family values and redemptive love. Like all the best comedies, it makes you laugh, it makes you cry and it makes you feel good to be alive. Everyone is wonderful in it, Cage most of all, and the ensemble grab the screwball feel and make their performances big and broad in the best, funniest way.

But when a local bigshot's wife gives birth to quintuplets, H.I. and Ed figure nobody will mind too much if they help themselves to one of the babies. However, all kinds of trouble are in store for this unusual family &#133;Raising Arizona is a wonderful film. It's just so much darned fun. As their careers have progressed, the Coen Brothers have become more successful and acclaimed but their films have lost a little bit of their pizazz, their joie de vivre. Check out this, their second movie, which is just a joy from start to finish; a smorgasbord of hilarious lines, funny off-the-wall performances, crazy antics, breathtaking film-making and sweet, good-natured sentimentality. The movie has several amazing sequences (the eleven minute montage opening, the dream of Lenny, H.I.'s goodbye note, the vision of the future), but the whole story blends into a beautiful little tale of comic folly, family values and redemptive love. Like all the best comedies, it makes you laugh, it makes you cry and it makes you feel good to be alive. Everyone is wonderful in it, Cage most of all, and the ensemble grab the screwball feel and make their performances big and broad in the best, funniest way. Both the dialogue and the accents are head-scratching gibberish - Well, which is it to be young feller ? You want ah should freeze, or get down on the ground ? Ah mean t'say, if'n ah freeze, ah can't rightly drop, and if'n ah drop, ah'm a-gonna be in motion &#133;  - but are never less than hilarious. There are too many good lines to count. It also packs in so much entertainment into ninety minutes; for example, it has a brilliant wedding scene which lasts exactly seven seconds and four shots - if only other movies could learn from the brevity of this example ! It also has one of the best chase sequences I've ever seen, a wild rampaging epic through a sleepy town which rushes along with dizzying speed. Kudos must go to the amazing cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld and the completely insane score by Carter Burwell, which sounds like a bunch of drunk guys with banjos and colds jamming Beethoven's Ode To Joy in somebody's kitchen.
