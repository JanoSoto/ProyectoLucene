Unfortunately, much of what we were all breathlessly looking forward to turned out to be more cold bath than hot stuff... case in point the first of the disastrously bad Star Wars prequels, the Phantom Menace, which apparently is the most successful Star Wars film ever...However, one film did live up to its hype, perhaps because it wasn't rammed down our throats for months in advance with advertising, marketing and cults far in excess of anything seen before or since... That film was the Matrix. This is not to say that the Matrix was under budgeted. With funds in excess of $100 million it was an enormous gamble by Joel Silver, throwing Keanu Reeves into another Sci-Fi superhero role when the world had only recently recovered from Jonny Mnemonic. But the Wachowskis stood by their nth choice man and Silver stood by them as they tore around Sydney blowing up helicopters and generally misbehaving. No one knew anything about it. Most of the industry insiders, those who even knew about the Matrix, predicted a massive flop. They were wrong. The Matrix kicked ass!Thanks to a brilliant advertising campaign, (remember asking yourself just what was the matrix!?!) the film opened to full houses and, more surprisingly, rave reviews which were completely justified. Using seemingly brand new effects, like bullet time, as well as the novel incorporation of tried and tested tools, such as wire work, the Matrix took what could have been your average superhero and made him a human being who was both fallible and liable to fail. At no point in the movie does the conclusion feel foregone and, with the brilliant twist around Cypher, there is a real sense that Neo mightn't succeed... and when he does it all the more enthralling because of it.Credit for all this lies with the Wachowskis, who seemed to have every single moment planned out to perfection before filming. Similarly Reeves deserves praise, for taking advantage of his perceived weaknesses as an actor to create the Anderson\/Neo character. Lawrence Fishburne is also great, delivering a performance perfectly balanced between seriousness and pantomime, while Carrie-Anne Moss' Trinity provides much of the soul of the Matrix, especially given that she's no damsel in distress. Of the remaining actors both Weaving and Pantoliano deserve much praise for their roles as bad guys, the latter doing remarkably well to make as odious a character as Cypher three dimensional while Agent Smith has to be the coolest villain since Darth Vader. Finally we shouldn't neglect Joel Silver in all this. Producer of what must have seemed like the biggest loss maker since Waterworld, Silver instead gave us one of the best films of the 1990's and a movie that will continue to excite future generations of action fans. His courage in bringing the Matrix to our screens should not be forgotten, although the missteps made with the sequels are not entirely forgivable.All in all the Matrix represents the culmination of a great deal of work and thought that, should any of the principle people involved have not believed in it 100%, we would probably have never even seen, let alone enjoyed. The film is second to none for juxtaposing philosophy with martial arts, but drives across its messages about Mankind's over reliance on technology without making the audience uncomfortable at being preached to. Overall there is very little that can be held against this movie and, despite the rather debatable suggestion that violence can be the answer, it works well for the younger and older crowds alike. If you haven't seen it then I cannot recommend it enough, but that is unlikely to be the case for many of you!

While it was not as popular in theaters, it soon became a beloved film on cable television and on VHS\/DVD. Set in a seaport town in the good old USA (I forget the exact location), this is the story of a mysterious, passionately written love letter who sparks emotions and confusion among the principal characters, each who think the letter is personally addressed to them. By the end of the film, we don't know who the lover or the beloved is but the power of the letter has altered the lives of nearly everyone in the small town. The cast is made up of wonderful actors who have fared well on TV and film, among them Kate Capshaw in the lead role of middle-aged beauty Helen, a bookstore owner, comedienne Ellen DeGeneres as her friend\/employee Janet Hall, young hottie Tom Everett Scott as Johnny, the young 20 something guy who falls for the older Hellen and an older Tom Selleck as the firefighter George Matthias who must compete with Johnny for Helen's affections. There are cameo roles by veteran old Hollywood actress Gloria Stuart, who is best known to modern audiences as the elderly Rose in Titanic (1997) and a cameo by Kate Capshaw's own daughter (with husband Steven Spielberg) Jessica Capshaw. The love triangle is between a middle-aged woman, an older man and a young man, each of whom feel as passionately for Helen as the writer of the mysterious letter. The conflict lies in Helen's indecision. Will she choose the right person ? Which man has the most to offer her ? Johnny is in a relationship with a girl his age who loves him with a passion all her own, and is in fact, a kind of reminder of what Helen was like at her age. George is in the process of divorcing his wife and has lived a worldly and eventful life. A cultured intellectual, he takes Helen on an opera date, where the tragic death of Puccini's ultra-Italian heroine Tosca moves Helen to explosive tears. There are lots of beautiful vistas of the charming coastal town, rendered beautifully by cinematographer Tami Reiker. The score is a paradise of romantic and lovely songs -  I've Never Been In Love Before, I'm In The Mood For Love and Only The Lonely. Ellen DeGeneres as Janet Hall, who is consistently late to her job at Helen's bookshop, who endlessly dates men without being able to find the right guy , is simply wonderful. She has not lost her comedic flair, even though at this point in her career she was not appearing much on TV or film because only about two years before her hit mid-90's TV show Ellen was cancelled because of her coming out as a lesbian and the new lesbian subject matter of the show. Here you even find comedian Jack Black, long before he made it big, in the bit part of a fisherman. This is a moving film about human emotions and making decisions that are significant, about the human need for a passionate consuming love and the general love of escapism brought not only through books, letters, and music, but through a genuinely loving and secure relationship. This is a great film with wonderful moments and an infectious romantic spirit.

(Gettit?) Fight Club(1999) is a highly stylised hybrid--a pitch-black comedy that's hard to like unless you're male, and (possibly) clawing your way BACK from the edge of abyss.It opens with a CGI-fly-past of firing neurons under the credits, suggesting what follows is caused by misfires in the protagonist's brain. But you miss that at first for all the uncharted territory.James Uhls' impressive screen adaptation continues Chuck Palahniuk's novel attempts to revolutionize men's views of their place in first-world-societies where caveman sensibilities are literally no longer required.Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt) characterizes our generation in one of his early Fight Club welcome speeches We're the middle children of history--we have no Great War, meaning that men raised without brutality still crave it--and why so many of them eagerly join up. But Club(1999) delineates its message for just one gender, never pretending to speak for women the narrator observes that before becoming yuppies, we used to read pornography young girls were never so inclined.Nevertheless, it's frightening how many people the film appeals to. Fans over-enthuse, saying this is the BEST movie EVER. Professional critics aren't so impressed. One courageous video & DVD guide claims that ...this appalling, grotesque, and interminable endurance-test is fairytale fiction for serial killers, imbeciles who succumb to road rage, and frustrated white guys--all the morons who seek excuses for their increasingly bad behavior and hair-trigger tempers.This temper-thing in the psych business is called sham-rage (or decortication after the severing of the neocortex in 1948 experiments on pussycats)- www.emotion.caltech.edu\/courses\/ss140\/April17-1.pdf. The misfire in Jack's brain depicts such a neurochemical break.But maybe Jack(Ed Norton) and Tyler(Brad Pitt) have a point. To me, the movie is saying that frustrated guys are really no good for women, because, frankly, they just don't want what women have to give. Such men might now want to bond only with each other, to satisfy ancient caveman instincts, which civilisation--and women--are trying to breed out of them.That's why Jack & Tyler's fight clubs quickly evolve into organised anarchism, and eventually nihilism--the wish to destroy all moral and social edifices males are getting back to their roots.Having said that, Fight Club(1999) tries to throw a lifeline to the seriously disaffected; but that lifeline falls on deaf ears. (*****Spoiler The ending depicts Jack's retaking control from his teacher by redefining his personal limits regarding violence. The protagonist successfully battles his delusion to finally regain himself. He has learnt better.*****) The nasty existentialism of anarchism\/nihilism still tends to appeal to young men, despite its dead-end logic. A recent email asked me whether I thought this philosophy of unreason was a mental deficiency or a choice. I call it a deficiency, as Fight Club(1999) does; the question is only how permanent that is. It can be considered foolishness--which is unlearnable; or sociopathy--which isn't.It's nice to know even its proponents (like my email friend) think this unreason is subject to cognitive override--choice--but why would anyone choose it unless their unreason validates some physiological syndrome? Anti-establishment anarchism was last big in the 19thC, having FIRST given rise to Machiavelli. During both periods it was a might-makes-right power struggle against ruling elites. We now think of these periods as callous, brutal and primitive, certainly not part of civilisation today. We expect civilians to abide by higher universal standards of humanism. Clearly, blowing up buildings and bashing each other half to death is antithetical to that social contract.However, I do like the film's position that male bonding, with\/without a sexual component, might be just what they need. During a bonding session with Tyler, as they consider Jack's heterosexual relationship, Jack admits, I can't get married; I'm a 30yr-old boy--to which Tyler adds, We're a generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we need.This is gender politics; and Norton goes to great lengths on the commentary track to explain Jack's mistreatment of Marla (Helena Bonham-Carter) as symptomatic of Jack's social and mental incompetence. Misogyny itself, the male hatred of women, may be physiologically inspired in such boy-men struggling to behave civilly. Ancient reptilian brain-structures produce the primal urge to violence (ie just to feel alive), so fight-club violence might not be caused by social malaise at all.I suspect this is the movie's--and novel's--most unpalatable basis, making Fight Club(1999) seem irresponsible to its critics.We usually call reptilian brain-structures primitive because except in lizards (hence lizard-logic), they're buried deep in the brain, overlain by higher, mammalian brain-structures. Lifelong learning encapsulated in the neocortex of, say, pussycats, inhibits\/overrides this reptilian dominance, but in some (decorticated pussycats or people) the process may be faulty, or just take too long. However if graduating beyond such lizard-logic (anarchist idiocy) takes fight-clubbers most of their lifetime, then so be it--until then, such men are welcome to have s*x with each other.Fight Club(1999)'s main problem is that it stirs up the powerful philosophical issue of anarchism\/nihilism, but leaves it unresolved, notably with its ending. The entire closing scene, including the bombing, is visually nebulous. Did all that happen, or was it just Jack's imagination? Comprehension is deliberately muddied by Jack's speedy recovery(!) from a fatal gunshot wound. Like many, I laughed at its absurdity.Yet the film's showmanship still wins new converts. It seems to set the benchmark for neocinema by demanding freeze-frame plus several viewings to build its enjoyment. Like Sixth Sense(1999), Club(1999) employs perception-shift for the lead character, but here it's integrated linearly to unfold the story. (In Sense(1999) the perception-shift is recursive- cf. www.cse.nd.edu\/courses\/cse233\/www\/lectures\/ri.pdf OR http\/\/mitpress.mit.edu\/sicp\/full-text\/sicp\/book\/node15.html.)Club(1999) further winks at us with single-frame interjections of--supposedly--Tyler's full frontals throughout Jack's narration. They serve both as alerts to Jack's insanity, and as visual easter-eggs.Other clever concepts are borrowed from social philosophy, eg the politics of rich women's fat-paranoia (soapmaking) true recycling, trés Soylent Green(1973).---END_OF_PART1--- ","genre":null},{"date":"15 September 2006","score":"7 out of 16 people found the following review useful","review":" How many nihilists does it take to change a light-bulb? -Half.

(Gettit?) Fight Club(1999) is a highly stylised hybrid--a pitch-black comedy that's hard to like unless you're male, and (possibly) clawing your way BACK from the edge of abyss.It opens with a CGI-fly-past of firing neurons under the credits, suggesting what follows is caused by misfires in the protagonist's brain. But you miss that at first for all the uncharted territory.James Uhls' impressive screen adaptation continues Chuck Palahniuk's novel attempts to revolutionize men's views of their place in first-world-societies where caveman sensibilities are literally no longer required.Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt) characterizes our generation in one of his early Fight Club welcome speeches We're the middle children of history--we have no Great War, meaning that men raised without brutality still crave it--and why so many of them eagerly join up. But Club(1999) delineates its message for just one gender, never pretending to speak for women the narrator observes that before becoming yuppies, we used to read pornography young girls were never so inclined.Nevertheless, it's frightening how many people the film appeals to. Fans over-enthuse, saying this is the BEST movie EVER. Professional critics aren't so impressed. One courageous video & DVD guide claims that ...this appalling, grotesque, and interminable endurance-test is fairytale fiction for serial killers, imbeciles who succumb to road rage, and frustrated white guys--all the morons who seek excuses for their increasingly bad behavior and hair-trigger tempers.This temper-thing in the psych business is called sham-rage (or decortication after the severing of the neocortex in 1948 experiments on pussycats)- www.emotion.caltech.edu\/courses\/ss140\/April17-1.pdf. The misfire in Jack's brain depicts such a neurochemical break.But maybe Jack(Ed Norton) and Tyler(Brad Pitt) have a point. To me, the movie is saying that frustrated guys are really no good for women, because, frankly, they just don't want what women have to give. Such men might now want to bond only with each other, to satisfy ancient caveman instincts, which civilisation--and women--are trying to breed out of them.That's why Jack & Tyler's fight clubs quickly evolve into organised anarchism, and eventually nihilism--the wish to destroy all moral and social edifices males are getting back to their roots.Having said that, Fight Club(1999) tries to throw a lifeline to the seriously disaffected; but that lifeline falls on deaf ears. (*****Spoiler The ending depicts Jack's retaking control from his teacher by redefining his personal limits regarding violence. The protagonist successfully battles his delusion to finally regain himself. He has learnt better.*****) The nasty existentialism of anarchism\/nihilism still tends to appeal to young men, despite its dead-end logic. A recent email asked me whether I thought this philosophy of unreason was a mental deficiency or a choice. I call it a deficiency, as Fight Club(1999) does; the question is only how permanent that is. It can be considered foolishness--which is unlearnable; or sociopathy--which isn't.It's nice to know even its proponents (like my email friend) think this unreason is subject to cognitive override--choice--but why would anyone choose it unless their unreason validates some physiological syndrome? Anti-establishment anarchism was last big in the 19thC, having FIRST given rise to Machiavelli. During both periods it was a might-makes-right power struggle against ruling elites. We now think of these periods as callous, brutal and primitive, certainly not part of civilisation today. We expect civilians to abide by higher universal standards of humanism. Clearly, blowing up buildings and bashing each other half to death is antithetical to that social contract.However, I do like the film's position that male bonding, with\/without a sexual component, might be just what they need. During a bonding session with Tyler, as they consider Jack's heterosexual relationship, Jack admits, I can't get married; I'm a 30yr-old boy--to which Tyler adds, We're a generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we need.This is gender politics; and Norton goes to great lengths on the commentary track to explain Jack's mistreatment of Marla (Helena Bonham-Carter) as symptomatic of Jack's social and mental incompetence. Misogyny itself, the male hatred of women, may be physiologically inspired in such boy-men struggling to behave civilly. Ancient reptilian brain-structures produce the primal urge to violence (ie just to feel alive), so fight-club violence might not be caused by social malaise at all.I suspect this is the movie's--and novel's--most unpalatable basis, making Fight Club(1999) seem irresponsible to its critics.We usually call reptilian brain-structures primitive because except in lizards (hence lizard-logic), they're buried deep in the brain, overlain by higher, mammalian brain-structures. Lifelong learning encapsulated in the neocortex of, say, pussycats, inhibits\/overrides this reptilian dominance, but in some (decorticated pussycats or people) the process may be faulty, or just take too long. However if graduating beyond such lizard-logic (anarchist idiocy) takes fight-clubbers most of their lifetime, then so be it--until then, such men are welcome to have s*x with each other.Fight Club(1999)'s main problem is that it stirs up the powerful philosophical issue of anarchism\/nihilism, but leaves it unresolved, notably with its ending. The entire closing scene, including the bombing, is visually nebulous. Did all that happen, or was it just Jack's imagination? Comprehension is deliberately muddied by Jack's speedy recovery(!) from a fatal gunshot wound. Like many, I laughed at its absurdity.Yet the film's showmanship still wins new converts.
