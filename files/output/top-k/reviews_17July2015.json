Title Doesn't mean much, but sounds effective.Pre-Titles Bond takes part in a routine training mission, but a fellow agent is killed. Bond battles the killer in a car and defeats him via an explosion. This is a superb opening with the excitement level cranked right up. The idea of training in Gibraltar is smart, the stunts are excellent and Dalton gets a memorable introduction.Theme Song Norwegian Pop band A-ha provide a good theme. It might sound too poppy or flashy for a Bond film, but it does have a mysterious and exotic quality to it that works surprisingly well. I think the lyrics are catchy too and the rhythm does stay in your head.Plot Bond helps a Soviet general Koskov defect, and when the same general is recaptured Bond tracks him to cello player Kara Milovy. Together they uncover a plot involving an American weapons dealer who aims to start a war. The plot flows excellently. What I like is how it is set-up and executed, Bond has a lot of work to do to figure out what is happening and there are plenty of interesting twists to keep you guessing. In this sense the film is the closest to From Russia with Love in feeling like pure espionage which is fantastic.James Bond Personally I'm a big Dalton fan and think he makes an excellent debut. He plays Bond as someone who is frequently on edge and not always pleased with his orders, this is a much tougher and more resourceful Bond which is great to see. Physically he looks perfect, while his youthfulness is a breath of fresh air after Moore.Bond Girls Maryam d'Abo does a solid job as Kara. She's has a very warm personality and she plays with such kindness that it's impossible not to like her. She doesn't get involved in the action much and gets a few iffy lines, but she a really likable presence and it's interesting to see Bond stick with one girl which allows for a lot more character development.Villains Jeroen Krabbe makes for a weak villain as faux defector Koskov. He's very charming and gives the role plenty of energy, but he just never convinces. The role is played up for laughs a little too much as it's difficult to find him threatening or intelligent. Joe Don Baker isn't much better as Whitaker. He seems too jolly in most scenes and the character would have work being more menacing. Andreas Wisniewski is really good as blonde henchmen Necros. He could have been generic, but his cunning persona and varied impersonations give him an edge.Support John Rhys-Davies is solid as usual as the conflicted Pushkin who is forced to trust Bond. Art Malik is very good as Afghan freedom fighter Kamran Shah, bringing a lot of dignity and intelligence to what could have been a difficult role. Thomas Wheatley is also enjoyable as Bond's uptight fellow agent Saunders.Action The action is very good. The defection of Koskov is a superb scene, filled to the brim with tension and shot excellently. The car chase through the icy Bratislava countryside is a great deal of fun and features some cool gadgets. Necros' attack on the safe house is nicely intense and gets gritty too. The best of all is Bond's battle with Necros hanging off the back of a cargo plane, it's shot wonderfully and has a real sense of danger. The climax is okay, it's tense but not as big or exciting as it should have been.Score John Barry's final Bond score is excellent. It has more of an electronic influence which adds so much excitement and there are a number of really classy pieces that help the emotional scenes along. The songs used by The Pretenders are also fantastic.Production Values The more grounded and espionage based approach works fantastically well here. It's very reminiscent of the early Bond films and all the better for it, it feels like Bond has to use his wits and the work he carries out is a lot less outlandish. This all fits in perfectly with Glen's directing style. The cinematography is very good too, it goes for a more natural look and as a result certain scenes look suitably gritty or tropical depending on what's needed. The editing is excellent, with many of the slower moments being treated with a great deal of interest and the plot unwinds at just the right pace. The writing is pretty good, there are some dodgy lines but many of the dialogue heavy scenes are engaging. The locations are all great and varied, Vienna looks truly beautiful and Afghanistan added something different once again.Conclusion The Living Daylights was a great start to Dalton's all too brief time as Bond. Going back to a more basic and espionage based approach works brilliantly. Dalton does a very effective job and gives a refreshingly serious take on the character. Maryam d'Abo makes a much more real and emotional Bond girl which is another plus. The villains are the weakest point, but they don't hold the film back in all honesty. Elsewhere I think the score, action and directing are all very impressive. This was clearly a return to the roots of Bond and it showed perfectly that a Bond film could be both interesting and entertaining.
