The Exorcist II The Heretic was an interesting sequel in that it went many places that an ordinary sequel would not be required. William Peter Blatty, the original novelist of the first story, later wrote his own traditional sequel, Legion which I understand became Exorcist III. Here, William Goodhart wrote the treatment and is credited with the screenplay that follows the heredity (pun intended) of the character of Fr. Merrin, whom Blatty in his original novel modeled after Teilhard de Chardin, who was considered a heretic by the Vatican ultimately, and in which Goodhart focuses his story on yet another troubled priest, played by Richard Burton, assigned with validating the sanctity of Merrin's death during his last exorcism, that of the young Reagan MacNeil again played by Linda Blair to clear Merrin's life work of any stain. Some of Chardin's thought on Collective Consciousness and Good and Evil is given sci-fi treatment to visualize some of the intriguing and otherwise hard-to-fathom ideas, let alone depict visually through a strobe light\/synchronizer which allows people within its frequency to interact and see and react to each other's thoughts, feelings, memories, etc. That's an awful lot to expect the average sequel to pull off, even one with a mega-history like its original and thereby causes some of the sequel's inevitable downfall. The fact that the story uses the Georgetown setting and uses some of the original characters causes the sequel to impale itself by making the real story about the demon's original identity (given in Blatty's book but not in the movie version), and making much of the only scares which are if you are afraid to look at bugs. This interesting element about swarms of locusts, sandwiching the original famed Iraq prologue with one new one of in Africa, but when Blair must connect herself with more silly acting to the actors in the Pazuzu demon story, I must sight exception of this as a very big mistake. What happens to the character of Sharon (giving Kitty Winn much more to do in this) too robs us of any plausibility. From John Boorman's direction, a director who I loved his work on the Dave Clark Five film, Having a Wild Weekend especially, and Deliverance and most of his subsequent work (I still can not say I liked Zardoz), Blair seems her AAN for The Exorcist was maybe a fluke or she just was better handled by William Friedkin who shot off guns on the set to get the actor's concentration. She is most undisciplined here, and shares time with Winn, Richard Burton, Louise Fletcher and even James Earl Jones with some pretty silly dialogue and antics given for them to perform that heighten the flaw that this is a sequel to the original, thereby crucifying the memory of it. Despite the controversy of some holdouts for acclaim for this sequel, I can not honestly on looking at it just now, say that it does work with any plausibility except to become stupefyingly vapid. Knowing the great power of the original to be scary, the idea of the sequel being so connected to Chardin thoughts on consciousness as being too serious and heady for a mainstream film, especially one is going to see because the original was considered the most frightening, and trying to scare us by our own, usually non-threatening thinking, it is no wonder that this film is usually written off. I remember liking Blatty's Legion sequel although I did not see the film of it (Exorcist III). Ennio Morricone did the soundtrack for Exorcist II and it too pales in comparison to the soundtrack of the original. I'd like to give Exorcist II The Heretic marks for originality and inventiveness, but mashing the follow-up to the original story with anything so new and so radical is deadly to popular opinion.

Before I begin this review, I would like to say that I haven't heard of Superman before, but I do love the director Richard Donner (who later made my childhood classic The Goonies) and given the critical praise this received, I like to give my thanks to him for doing such a great job at making a classic example of a superhero movie.The reason why i'm giving this a nine out of ten is because there are some corny moments in almost the entire movie. But there isn't anything else to fault this epic film with. The story, despite it's corny moments, is compelling and dramatic with poignant moments including the romance between Lois Lane and Superman (AKA Clark Kent). The pacing is well done and takes its time to develop the characters. In fact, the characters are hard not to like them thanks to the solid performances from a great cast. Christopher Reeves did a solid job as the Man of Steel while Gene Hackman is a comic, but sinister Lex Luthor. Other cast members like Marlon Brando, Ned Beatty, and Margot Kidder as Lois Lane did great with the material they've been given.The directing from Richard Donner is lavish and focused, the cinematography and scenery is excellent, and the script is smart, witty, and funny. The best aspect, however, would have to go to the music score from John Williams. He has written some great scores and his score here is no exception. It has some poignant melodies with an excellent orchestra and the main theme that represents Superman is epic and memorable.Overall, aside from being far from perfect, Superman The Movie is an example of a superhero classic that Hollywood had intended to do make a superhero franchise that is beyond successful.

But now...years later...how can you not see this for the stone cold B-Movie classic that it is? I am not being sarcastic in the least, I had a great time watching this. Is it a great movie? Heck no. The script is terrible and I'm still not sure the action sequences and plot make any sense at all and who cares!! It was still an era where action\/comedies always had to have this deep gangster storyline. The sole reason to watch this film is the incredibly cheesy one liners. I had a smile from ear to ear when Stallone yells STOP...or my Mom will shoot. In fact, I watched that scene twice. Stallone's charisma (I am a monster fan I admit) is perfect and so much more down to earth than his usual macho action flicks. Best of all the awkward chemistry between him and Estelle Getty just works on such a bad level...again yes I mean it! There is very little truly good about the film and yet it is incredibly entertaining and fun and quirky and ridiculous. For me it just works! I admit that my adoration for Stallone has existed since I was just a little boy and he can do very little wrong in my books. This was a very different role for him being in the action character but holding his own in the comedy department. His character does not have a lot of depth and that's good for this film. He is probably the sole reason to see this movie. Estelle Getty...brilliant on Golden Girls and this is likely the only other thing I've seen her in and...well she isn't good. Her line delivery is awkward, she is really annoying (although that is the point) and the chemistry between her and Stallone is completely bizarre and it works! Her Mom character Tutti is fantastically bad and obnoxious and watching her make the same mistake again and again is fun! I don't think anyone else could have done the role the way she did. JoBeth Williams is Stallone's love interest. Her character is supposed to be tough as nails and rough around the edges and she is that but only in the most basic form. She is given very little development and the romance feels mostly forced. Its a small role though and doesn't take or add anything to the script. Roger Rees could have been a formidable villain, he has the look and the voice but the character is really written poorly so there is never really any chance for him to show off.Director Roger Spottiswoode has had a very mixed career. Mostly he's had a lot of B-Movie with perhaps the exception of the late 80's classic Turner and Hooch which most people consider great! However, there is no doubt that he brings a fun campy style to this movie. He uses Stallone's charisma and macho attitude as the focus of the comedy. I do completely understand why the film bombed at the time but allow me to suggest that this is now one of those films that has aged to the point of being timeless now. It has some genuine laughs and doesn't strictly use the fish out of water comedy to force the comedy. Its ironic but as I said the script is bad, everyone in the film feels rigid and awkward and yet something about it just appeals to me. I could easily watch it again and I was extremely entertained even if it was by how bad the movie was. I won't apologize for it and I guess we can chalk it up to a guilty little pleasure.

Stallone's charisma (I am a monster fan I admit) is perfect and so much more down to earth than his usual macho action flicks. Best of all the awkward chemistry between him and Estelle Getty just works on such a bad level...again yes I mean it! There is very little truly good about the film and yet it is incredibly entertaining and fun and quirky and ridiculous. For me it just works! I admit that my adoration for Stallone has existed since I was just a little boy and he can do very little wrong in my books. This was a very different role for him being in the action character but holding his own in the comedy department. His character does not have a lot of depth and that's good for this film. He is probably the sole reason to see this movie. Estelle Getty...brilliant on Golden Girls and this is likely the only other thing I've seen her in and...well she isn't good. Her line delivery is awkward, she is really annoying (although that is the point) and the chemistry between her and Stallone is completely bizarre and it works! Her Mom character Tutti is fantastically bad and obnoxious and watching her make the same mistake again and again is fun! I don't think anyone else could have done the role the way she did. JoBeth Williams is Stallone's love interest. Her character is supposed to be tough as nails and rough around the edges and she is that but only in the most basic form. She is given very little development and the romance feels mostly forced. Its a small role though and doesn't take or add anything to the script. Roger Rees could have been a formidable villain, he has the look and the voice but the character is really written poorly so there is never really any chance for him to show off.Director Roger Spottiswoode has had a very mixed career. Mostly he's had a lot of B-Movie with perhaps the exception of the late 80's classic Turner and Hooch which most people consider great! However, there is no doubt that he brings a fun campy style to this movie. He uses Stallone's charisma and macho attitude as the focus of the comedy. I do completely understand why the film bombed at the time but allow me to suggest that this is now one of those films that has aged to the point of being timeless now. It has some genuine laughs and doesn't strictly use the fish out of water comedy to force the comedy. Its ironic but as I said the script is bad, everyone in the film feels rigid and awkward and yet something about it just appeals to me. I could easily watch it again and I was extremely entertained even if it was by how bad the movie was. I won't apologize for it and I guess we can chalk it up to a guilty little pleasure. Still I think if you look at it from the perspective I have suggested I think you'll have a ton of fun with it! You obviously can't take it seriously so don't and enjoy! I sure did. 7.5\/10 ","genre":"Action, Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"7 May 2013","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" The Killer Tomantoes are back and honestly this is one of my favorite stupid movies. I think this was honestly, better than the Original movie 1978's Attack of the Killer Tomantoes. It's works as a parody of the real threat of Communism. It also spoofs old monster movies such as Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956). The running gags are just over the top fun. I like the silly product placements, the secret word game show, and everybody liking Full Contact America's Cup Yacht Racing. The sight gags, sound gags, satire and clever humor all works here. There is a lot of catchy quotes in this film. There is only a few jokes that hit rock bottom for me. Director John De Bello made the sequel to a campy cult-classic, better than ever. De Bello even pokes fun at the movie, themselves, as he breaks the fourth wall to reveal the cheapness of the production on several occasions. The low-budget can be a bit disappointing like showing old footage from the first film way too much. Not only did De Bello renew the inane humor of the original, but also bring in new kooky characters to work with some of the original cast. The hilariously off-beat performances of all those actors account for much of the film's success. Professor Gangreen (John Astin) and his weather-man wannabe dumb hunky assistant Igor (Steve Lundquist) are just some of the new characters in the film. Their goal is to transformed simple tomatoes into vicious Rambo look alike tomato-men in another evil attempt at world domination! It is up to a new group of heroes to stop Professor Gangreen before the streets run red with the Red Meance. That group is a group of pizza makers, Matt (George Clooney) and Chad (Anthony Starke) who works for their Uncle Lt. Finletter's no-tomatoes pizza parlor (Steven Rock Peace reprising his role from the original movie).This was George Clooney's first full length film and compared to the first killer tomato movie, the acting is pretty darn good throughout. Still, I kinda get confused if I'm watching George Clooney here, or John Stamos. They look very similar to each other at the time. They uncovered Gangreen's scheme, when Chad meets Professer Gangreen's assistant Tara (Karen Mistel) who escape from his hide out with a fuzzy tomato, or FT for short. Karen Mistal is very hot and stunning. She gives off some pretty good humor parts as well. He soon find out that there is something about her that doesn't add up. Can the group save the world from Professer Gangreen and his armies of tomato-men? If you didn't like this movie, well I feel sorry for you. It's just fun mindless comedy horror flick. The point of the film is be off the wall stupid film. So it's hard to criticize a film for that. It's suppose to be cheap, dumb, and cheesy. If you don't like it, maybe Big-Breasted Girls Go to the Beach and Take Their Tops Off will be your type of film. If you do like this movie, make sure to watch the Attack of the Killer Tomatoes The Animated Series. If you haven't saw this movie. Go watch it and make some toast, eggs, bacon, toast, waffles and toast with it.

I don't think anyone who ever read the book considered it the most remote of possibilities ... indeed, many, like myself, didn't want to see someone attempt a movie of it since how could you capture so much of the hallucinatory nature of the novel, the bad craziness, and the wonderful goings-on inside the head of the Good Doctor and Founder of Gonzo Journalism? It seemed impossible.But as the years went by and computer generated special effects became something most enterprising geeks could do rather well in the basement of their parent's home, it seemed as if it might actually happen.And when it was announced and the key players were listed, unlike most movie announcements of favorite novels becoming movies, I was quite heartened by the names.Terry Gilliam as director -- anyone who could make Brazil, even in the studio castrated version, Time Bandits a hallucinatory journey if there ever was one, Fisher King and Twelve Monkeys as well (not to mention the oddly-hilarious little animations he made for the Monty Python series way back when) well I thought if anyone could, he could.Johnny Depp as Hunter S. Thompson -- I was worried about his looks frankly ... I mean, seriously, this guy is just too good looking to play Thompson, someone who once wrote that a photo of the ten best writers in America could also double as a photo of the ten ugliest men in America, was not a matinée idol to say the least ... but after living in Thompson's basement for six months, capturing every nuance of Thompson's persona and combining that with a bald 'toupee', well he had the character down, the funny odd duck walk brought on by a bit too much of everything at hand as well as the syrupy melodic voice ... outstanding in the end and one of his best roles among many great roles.Benicio Del Toro -- well can't say I knew much about this actor prior to this movie other than the ensemble piece, Usual Suspects, a movie I was not nearly as impressed with as most others were ... but he put his heart into this role packing on 40 or 50 lbs it looks like considering the gut he readily shows as Thompson's Somonan attorney.And the many others who show up for brief but important parts Ellen Barkin as the worn out waitress (yet somehow sexy); Gary Busey as the highway patrolman who has to make the extra effort to pull Hunter over as he explains the correct way to get out of a ticket (one of my favorite dialogs); Penn Jillette who is a barker at the Circus casino and he does it to perfection including once he ascertains that Hunter and his attorney are not interested is what he's pitching literally pushes them along and attacks the next rubes coming his way (having spent many years at the local county fair I can attest to his accurate portrayal); Harry Dean Stanton as the heartless judge, very small but he makes an impression; Cameron Diaz as the hapless documentarian in the elevator and her smile always brightens a scene I must say; Christopher Meloni taking a complete about face from my wife's favorite detective show cop to the gay desk clerk having to deal with an irate crew-cut, love-it-or-leave-it cop and Hunter's perfect assessment of the scene in beautifully delivered lines by Meloni; Christina Ricci as the whacked-out bible freak whose brain has been permanently pureed by various substances given her by Hunter's attorney; Debbie Reyolds actual voice singing when the two last only a very short time at her performance (Depp himself called Reynolds telling her she had to do the voice herself and apparently he was charming enough to get her to do the gig); and there are others but this is getting to be quite a list ... except for one last mention that the actual Red Shark, the fire-engine red Chevy Impala is the actual Red Shark they took to Vegas and Thompson owned til the end ... still in beautiful shape ... and for those of us who have owned an early '70s Impala, I'd wager that we'd all give quite a bit to have it back ... that was a great car ... of course, it had to have the big block 350 four barrel ... the old saying was true of that car If it had wings ... So rambling as always, read the book, watch the movie ... take the ticket, ride the ride ... a perfect soundtrack also accompanies the wild ride through this two-hour wonderful romp of the good ol' days when drugs were handy and you could just look at someone and know they were one of us ...Just always remember You can turn your back on a person, but never turn your back on a drug, especially when its waving a razor sharp hunting knife in your eye. Words that have served me well through the years, believe me ...

First-time director\/writer Paul Thomas Anderson takes time and care to develop his characters and this approach pays off handsomely, as it's the strength of these characters and the relationships between them that ultimately make this movie so interesting and memorable.The tense atmosphere and deliberate pacing, which are established right from the start, create a closeness between the two men and also add emphasis to the anxieties and suspicions that are present between them, especially during their first meeting.As he approaches a roadside diner somewhere in Nevada, Sydney Brown (Philip Baker Hall), a professional gambler in his sixties, sees a young man who's clearly down-on-his-luck sitting on the ground close to the entrance of the building. He offers to buy him a cup of coffee and give him a cigarette. Sydney soon learns that John (John C Reilly) has lost all his money whilst gambling in an attempt to raise enough cash to pay for his mother's funeral. Sydney offers to show the young man how to be successful in the casinos and despite his understandable scepticism, John agrees.A couple of years later, John has prospered as Sydney's protégé and after having paid off his mother's funeral costs, gets married to an attractive cocktail waitress called Clementine (Gwyneth Paltrow). John has also become friendly with Jimmy (Samuel L Jackson) who's a security officer and a man that Sydney dislikes and really doesn't trust.Clementine's part-time work as a hooker leads to trouble when one of her clients refuses to pay and she and John keep the man hostage in their motel room. Sydney is called to help them out and soon takes control of the situation but also runs into bigger trouble shortly after, when Jimmy threatens and blackmails him.Philip Baker Hall gives a top class performance as the lonely, well dressed, experienced gambler with a face that's filled with sadness and lines. He's dignified and shrewd and looks as if he's been through some tough experiences but also finds it gratifying to help John out. John is another lonely person who appreciates the progress he's made under Sydney's guidance but his poor judgement and gullibility will clearly make it impossible for him to ever fully emulate his mentor's success. John C Reilly, in a consistently strong performance, is very natural and convincing in the way that he portrays John's naivety and impetuosity.Clementine is not as streetwise as she needs to be and Gwyneth Paltrow conveys her character's underlying sadness very effectively. Samuel L Jackson is also on great form as the violent thug who totally underestimates Sydney.Hard Eight is haunting and poignant and its overall tone and tempo is perfect for a movie in which a dark secret, hidden motives and a need for redemption affect so much of what takes place.

The dialogs are well written. The characters are all unique and have all performed well. We can connect to each of the character in the movie. Some are nerds, discussing deep, philosophical matters, theories, etc, who are decent and less violent as compared to the other groups. Some are violent, rash, rude and have all those character traits of a person, our parents warn us to stay away from. They make a joke of authority, care least about their own future and get involved in drugs, smoking, drinking etc.There's a line by a character in the movie which goes something on the lines of if life's so short then we should enjoy it to the maximum while we are alive. Some kids take it too seriously and ruin their lives. I almost felt like talking to these kids and telling them its not the way of life, and that they are wasting their lives' best days. But then they would scoff at any such idea which stops them from enjoying.Some parts are very funny. Whenever Slater comes on screen, its hilarious. And there are parts where we can see how vulnerable some of the characters are to find someone to fall in love with. There is some great sound tracks running in the background which sets the mood for the 70's. Some great dialogs too.There is no conclusion shown but that bitter-sweet period is captured brilliantly.

This sort of made me think about the human conscience and unstable people out there. Now this film will probably known for having Keanu Reeves when he was at his peak when it comes to his looks. But the show stealer is Crispin Glover, who is the most memorable character in this film and his freakouts are just so darn humorous. Yeah, I kinda feel bad about adding the word humorous for a movie like this, especially when it's based on a true event. But he does add a bit of humor to this movie as this over obsessive guy that spas out occasionally with motives and intentions that is so darn awkward. Or just doesn't make much sense. Any fan of Crispin Glover should check this film out. It's a shocking and engrossing film about teens with disillusioned thoughts and warped conscience. There is also one of the most annoying 12yr old kid character in this.8\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"7 May 2013","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I had been postpone of watching this movie so many times,but once i was checking movies randomly as which movie i have to watch today?then accidentally i have seen this movie.

Once again, the film would be bankrolled by Dino De Laurentiis but with a major studio (Universal) and an even higher budget ($13 million) to boot. Picking up where the last film went off, unassuming S-Mart housewares clerk Ash Williams literally falls out of the sky into England's Dark Ages, which is swarming by ferocious Deadites. Before he can come back home Ash must find the Necronomicon, get the beautiful maiden Shelia and battle his evil counterpart's Army of the Dead. And that's how the plot goes.But since I'm only reviewing the Director's Cut of Army of Darkness there might be some spoilers ahead. Although conceived in the same splatstick style as with the previous film, Army takes the complete 180-degree turn from blood-spraying horror to the exciting swordplay of Ray Harryhausen epics. Equipped with his trusty chainsaw-hand and boomstick, Bruce Campbell's Ash is at his funniest and perhaps his most chauvinistic right here. And I'm still surprised that Bruce prospered to stay in shape for years between installments. The supporting actors in Army are a delight. Embeth Davidtz (Schindler's List) is fetchingly gorgeous as both the Good and Bad Shelia. While Marcus Gilbert is okay as Arthur, Richard Grove outshines as Duke Henry. Ian Abercrombie (Mr. Pitt from Seinfeld) is always a welcoming presence as the Wiseman. In the continuing game of musical chairs, Linda is played by a once much-recognizable Bridget Fonda. For the film's scene-stealing moment, Patricia Tallman's possessed witch literally scared the pants off of me when she appeared on camera. I'm dead serious.When watching the Director's Cut of Army, I began to see flaws in the film that completely drag especially in the overlong slapstick scenes. The original ending for the international release in which Ash oversleeps in the cave and wakes up in a post-apocalyptic future was a more fitting conclusion. If you've watched all three films closely, you start to wonder why Ash isn't the conventional hero. According to Sam Raimi, he believed Ash was more of a fool, which is why he liked to torture him so much in his films and being a goof and drinking too much potion was in his character.

Filled with terrific direction,great performances,a wonderful screenplay and a dark,unforgettable soundtrack,River's Edge is an Underrated classic that you won't forget.Set in California and Based on the true story of the 1981 murder of Marcy Renee Conrad who was murdered by boyfriend Jacques Broussard,River's Edge tells the story of teenager Samson 'John' Tollet(Daniek Roebeck)who murders his girlfriend Jamie(Danyl Deats). When John goes to school and tells his friends he killed his girlfriend,his friends don't believe John until he shows them the dead body. Realizing the danger,John's friend Layne(Crispin Glover)wants to protect him and leaves John under the watch of Local drug dealer Feck(Dennis Hopper)while John's other friends Matt(Keanu Reeves)and Clarissa(Ione Skye Leitch)are conflictedturn John in or be conflicted about it.Released in 1986\/87,River's Edge was a great film because it was different from other Teen films at the time because it was not a John Hughes film or a Brat Pack film,but a dark Teen film that stands right next to Heathers as the darkest,Nihilistic Teen film of the 1980s that paved the way for films like Alpha Dog,Bully and Mean Creek. River's Edge is a powerful film that right from the start gives viewers a world that is bleak and filled with sadness and hopelessness and where you feel like the Teen characters have no future and will have nothing going for them and the only things that the teens can do is get stoned or drunk and have no emotion where the characters home life and town are broken and very downbeat. The teens in this film are not interested in going to the prom or getting a date but are focused and interested in doing nothing with their lives. What is shocking and disturbing about River's Edge isn't the murder itself(which is horrible)but how the characters react and feel about the murder. When the murder happens each character has a different feeling about it. Layne wants to protect John at any and all costs despite John murdering Jamie,John doesn't care about himself or the murder,Matt and Clarissa are conflicted and Feck cannot understand why John is so uncaring. Throughout the film there is a dark feeling of apathy and carelessness because despite Jamie being murdered the film's main characters act like the murder never happened or Jamie never existed or that the kids are too dazed and confused to care. You can say that RE is a Horror film in some ways not just because of the murder and dread surrounding the film but a Horror film about feelings and human emotions in society and how we as people deal with the harshness and darkness of most human beings. This film is a dark and grim study of human nature and apathy and how we as humans deal with things in life and you can say is true to the term disaffected youth because the teens don't know how to feel or react to the situation. What I also love about the film is the movie's offbeat and dark Humor which is thanks to the characters Lanye and Feck with Lanye trying to protect John at all costs and saying funny dialog and Feck whether it's scenes when he's dealing drugs to the kids and saying funny dialog,watching John or having conversations with his plastic sex doll Ellie. While the film is a drama River's Edge has a quirky sense of Humor. The screenplay by Neal Jimenez is excellent with Jimenez giving the film and the main characters well-written dialog as well as great depth and personality. Jimenez says the characters were based on friends that he knew and I really believe him because the characters feel real and truthful and the dialog doesn't feel forced but natural and honest. The ending of the film is excellent because of it's ambiguous nature and how it makes viewers asks questions rather than easily answering them for us and it's one of the things that makes River's edge a great film.The whole cast does great in their roles. Crispin Glover is brilliant,funny and over the top as Layne,the one who wants to protect John. Keanu Reeves is wonderful as Matt,with Reeves bringing depth to the role. Ione Skye Leitch is fantastic as Clarissa,Matt's love interest. Daniel Roebuck is great and bone-chilling as John,the killer of the film. Dennis Hopper is amazing,funny and over the top as Feck,a local drug dealer,with Hopper making Feck the most sympathetic character in the film. Joshua Miller is disturbing and memorable as Tim,Matt's little brother. Tom Bowler(Bennett),Jim Metzler(Mr. Burkewaite),Leo Rossi(Jim),Roxanna Zal(Maggie),Josh Richman(Tony),Phillip Brock(Mike),Constance Forslund(Madeleine),Taylor Negron(Checker) and Tammy Smith(Kim)give good performances as well.The direction by Tim Hunter is excellent,with Hunter bringing a dark,eerie,somber and gritty tone to the film and uses great camera angles and shots. Great direction by Hunter.The score by Jurgen Kniper is masterful,dark,big and powerful and definitely fits in with the tone of the film. A great score by Kniper. The film also great songs on the soundtrack from Slayer(Die By The Sword,Evil Has No Boundaries,Tormentor,Captor Of Sin),Fates Warning(Kyrie Eleison),Hallows Eve(Lethal Tendencies),Agent Orange(Fire In The Rain),The Vipers(Let Me Know),Burning Spear(Happy Day)and Hank Ballard(I'm Gonna Miss you and Let's Go,Let's Go,Let's Go).

Basically in 1936, Tokyo, former prostitute Sada Abe (Eiko Matsuda) works now as a maid in a hotel, and she is molested by the owner of the hotel Kichizo Ishida (Tatsuya Fuji), but she is not offended by it and the two of them begin an intense affair. They make love passionately with all kinds of sexual experimentation, drinking and other various forms of self-indulgence, and they do not seem to be bothered with people walking in on them, and to pursue his affair with her Ishida leaves his wife and family. As time passes Abe for some reason becomes jealous of Ishida, probably in terms of receiving pleasure, and she also becomes very possessive, but all he ever wants to do is make her happy, whether it means more intense experimental sex. They become so obsessed with their escalating attempts to achieve the ultimate love making experience and orgasm that he allows her to engage in sadomasochism, this mostly involves her strangling during lovemaking. Eventually it comes to the point when Ishida is killed by Abe strangling him to death, but she is not completely phased by his death, in fact she goes as far to cut off his penis and testicles, and with his blood write the words Sada Kichi the two of us forever on his chest. Being based on a true event the real woman was arrested for the crime of murder, but in fact many people who heard about the story were empathetic towards her because of the passionate love she had for the man. Also starring Aoi Nakajima as Toku, Meika Seri as Maid Matsuko and Taiji Tonoyama as Old Beggar. I will be honest and say first that I was most intrigued to see real lovemaking on screen, and it is not something I have seen often in a foreign film regarded by critics, but then I remembered seeing a clip of the controversial ending on a programme, very hard to watch, it is a very interesting insight into how extreme passion can sometimes go too far, a most watchable erotic drama based on a true story. It was number 28 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Very good!
