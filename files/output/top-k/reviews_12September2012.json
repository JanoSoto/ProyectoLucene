","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"12 September 2012","score":"5 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Philip Schuyler Green is a journalist who is asked by a New York magazine publisher to write an article on anti-Semitism in America. He is initially reluctant to accept the commission, but eventually agrees, and although he is a gentile decides to adopt a Jewish identity and to write about his own experiences. This is not difficult as he is not well-known in the city, having recently moved there from California. Green adopts the Jewish-sounding name Phil Greenberg and is shocked by the prejudice he encounters. A doctor makes unprofessional remarks about a Jewish colleague, he is refused admission to an upmarket restricted hotel and his son Tommy is subjected to anti-Semitic bullying at school. To make matters worse, Green discovers that anti-Jewish prejudice exists even at the supposedly liberal magazine he works for. His secretary, Elaine Wales, reveals that she is Jewish but was forced to adopt a gentile-sounding pseudonym in order to get the job. (When she applied under her real name, Estelle Walovsky, her application was rejected). Besides Green's professional work, the film also deals with his personal life. He is a widower with a young son, living with his mother. An important theme in the film is his romance with Kathy, the niece of his publisher, a romance which is placed under strain when he begins to suspect that Kathy's views on racial matters may be less liberal than his own. The title Gentleman's Agreement refers on one level to Kathy's home affluent town of Darien, Connecticut, whose residents have an unwritten agreement not to sell property to Jews. On a wider level, however, the title also refers to a gentlemen's agreement among American gentiles (and, indeed, among some American Jews) not to mention or to confront the problem of anti-Semitism.It was a brave, and controversial, move for the studio, 20th Century- Fox, to tackle this subject in 1947. Many Americans would have preferred to believe that anti-Semitism was something alien, associated with the evil Nazi regime which they had defeated two years earlier, and did not want to hear that it was still a problem in their own country. The film was, apparently, a personal initiative by the studio's head, Darryl F. Zanuck, who held strong views about the issue. Zanuck, in fact, was one of the few Hollywood moguls of the era who were not Jewish, and some influential Jewish figures in the industry tried to persuade him not to make it. The film's political theme drew it to the attention of the House Un-American Activities Committee, which called Zanuck, director Elia Kazan and some of its stars to testify before it. Zanuck was rewarded for his courage when the film was nominated for eight Oscars and won three including Best Picture and Best Director for Kazan. (The third went to Celeste Holm as Best Supporting Actress). Yet in my view it is, artistically speaking, not a very good film. It is certainly not in the same class as Kazan's other Oscar-winner On the Waterfront. I have not seen all the films which were in contention for Best Picture in 1947, but one which definitely deserved the Oscar far more was David Lean's masterly version of Great Expectations. (Another unsuccessful nomination, Crossfire, which I have not seen, also dealt with the subject of anti-Semitism). The film's artistic faults are twofold. Firstly, it is overlong and static, too dominated by talk with little in the way of action. Secondly, the character of Green, as played by Gregory Peck, is an unattractive one, the sort of liberal who is so convinced of the rightness of his views that he becomes a self-righteous bore and even something of a bully, prepared to harangue mercilessly not only those who disagree with him but also those whom he suspects of agreeing with him with insufficient fervour. I found his berating of Elaine particularly distasteful. Certainly, some of Elaine's views do seem objectionable; she is, for example, less than happy when the firm introduces a new, explicitly non-discriminatory recruitment policy because of her fears that the wrong sort of Jews will be attracted to the company. It did, however, seem presumptuous of the gentile Green, on the basis of eight weeks pretending to be a Jew, to lecture a Jewish woman on the best way to combat anti-Semitism, a problem she has presumably had to fight all her life. Whenever Green gets onto the subject of prejudice with Kathy he seems less like a man speaking to the woman he loves than a politician engaging in a heated debate with an opponent, so much so that my sympathies were with Kathy when she stormed out on him. Hollywood could indeed make excellent films about racial prejudice, and Peck was later to star in one of the greatest of these, To Kill a Mockingbird. Another good one from the late forties is Clarence Brown's Intruder in the Dust. Gentleman's Agreement, by contrast, serves as a reminder that not every film made in support of a good cause is necessarily a good one. It is difficult to avoid the suspicion that all those Oscar nominations were made more on account of the film's politics than on account of its artistic merits. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 September 2012","score":"5 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Philip Schuyler Green is a journalist who is asked by a New York magazine publisher to write an article on anti-Semitism in America.

We Were Soldiers stars Mel Gibson as a military man leading a group of platoons in the Vietnam War. The movie focuses on the combat of Vietnam and delivers some really good action scenes, but also brings emotion and love to the table. Mel Gibson brings an average performance, compared to other roles he has played, but still gets the job done, but who stole the show in my opinion was the wives of the soldiers. They played a huge role and they were as close as the soldiers were and that shows a lot. They delivered each other's telegrams when they had to find out their husbands were dead. It is just loyalty and friendship the audience should appreciate.The beginning on the movie shows the soldiers in training and with their families. This gave the audience time to know the soldiers and fall in love with their characters. One soldier had a newborn baby then left to fight. Character development was strong in the beginning while action and battle carried out till the end. The character that Mel Gibson played was certainly interesting with his devotion to the army and God. After seeing Passion of The Christ I did think it was weird seeing Mel Gibson praise the man he would later slaughter in one of his movies, but that's just a side note. Gibson's character is a leader and he motivates his squad giving a great speech before they deploy. He promises no man will be left behind and as I'm sure that promise cannot be kept it would still make me feel batter as a soldier. He talks about how soldiers are family and Gibson just naturally plays the role. The only problem I had with him was he showed little emotion and seemed like a statue, even during battle. It didn't seem human, how can a man just not react? He always kept his composer. I'm sure some people thought it was a god thing but I did not like it.I also loved Gibson's second hand man, forgive me for not knowing characters names because there are so many of them and I only saw the movie once. Anyway, the old guy with the pistol, he was great. While he showed little emotion his seriousness brought a laugh here and there, intimidation, and a veteran presence. He was an old school guy who preferred the old school way. I liked how the movie had little Easter eggs, for example, he says he prefers the pistol to the new M16 and Gibson says something like, how do you know the enemy will be that close. Then later in the movie he shoots people down with his pistol from close range. There were definitely many problems with this movie, the main one being the length. This movie was two hours and twenty minutes. After about an hour and a half I thought the movie would be wrapping up but instead it introduced a new character and kept on going. The new character was the camera man and he took pictures of the carnage of Vietnam, His character was definitely important and needed, but he came in too late. He had such a presence and brought a different attitude and tone to the movie it just got under used. Other problems were too much use of slow motion and too many jumps and surprises with deaths. A soldier would be walking and then he would be dead. That effect to start a battle isn't bad but it was overused. Final seconds of a soldier's life were cheesy with their last words and their reactions. Tell my wife I love her works but it didn't work where it was used. I give the movie credit for sticking really well to the time period. Introducing the M16 rifle and the use of Napalm are small parts of the movie with an impact. People who love history and the military would appreciate that and the movie does a good job of knowing its facts and doing the research.Overall, We Were Soldiers was not a bad movie, but it was not fantastic either. I have seen better war movies and I have seen worse. Acting was a little shaky but strong overall; the story dragged a little bit and was too long but still memorable. I would watch it again and buy it to see again. Watch it with a bunch of your guy friends to enjoy a manly movie that women can still enjoy and maybe even cry to. We Were Soldiers is a good time but does not get the WillyT Seal of Approval.
