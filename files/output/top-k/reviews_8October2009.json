[{"date":"8 October 2009","score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Having quite enjoyed the original early 1930s film Frankenstein, when I saw its sequel was even more feted and dubbed the best monster film ever, I made sure to rent it.Well, certainly its more technologically advanced, with a bigger budget and music on the soundtrack (although the almost audible silence on the original, so characteristic of early 1930s films, I found quite eerie). But I didn't really rate it. Like the Bond film Quantum of Solace to Casino Royale, it starts only 15 minutes after the last film ends. Problem is, they wrapped it up nicely at the end of the last film, so the sequel has to contrivedly and unconvincingly unpick all the loose ends to start the story up again. It's not a long film, and half an hour in we're back to the Monster rampaging through the woods all over again. Only this time it's a mite comical, less Frankenstein than Frank Spencer, as he well-meaningly gatecrashes women in the woods and they run off scared and screaming.A wily old mentor, who we've never seen before, arrives to coerce the scientist into having another bash at his experiments. (This is a common problem with sequels in which the 'hero' has learned his lesson the first time, or is too cowardly to go through it again - they have to be coerced by someone but it loses its dramatic edge imo.) To show he's a dab hand himself, this mentor reveals his own experiments, but they're so far-fetched and far ahead of the scientist's cut and paste job, it defies belief. What's more, the director presents it as if it's funny when it could be plain horrible. There is a strange relevance to the story, what with the controversy over stem cell experimentation. In some respects the difference is between the Bond villain Jaws in The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker. In one he's a nasty, scary horror, in the other it's done more for laughs and he's almost quite amiable.The bride is certainly quite alien and disturbing when she appears, but that's only in the last five minutes of the film!

It got all the spices; stripteases, sex scene, some violence, and lesbian tension. Actually it could've been deeper with more, but it didn't want to. So don't concentrate on the Satire as its makers didn't too. Otherwise why the tagline is (Leave Your Inhibitions At The Door) ?! I laugh whenever I read an angry review about this movie where the reviewer shouts the acting was BAD ! Well, dear whoever you are, you're so wrong ! Because who would evaluate (Peter Weller)'s performance as (RoboCop) for the same director ?!! Actually this movie is more frank than these people; whereas it presented its point of view without any pedantry at all. And its point of view, for any dumb didn't understand it yet, is to SHOW (and it's a case where the movie makers were so truthful to their cause !). It is unruly commercial movie. And I don't think that its makers should be ashamed of themselves, since they spared no effort to present their goods, the same old goods, however so pure this time and without big stars. The thing is the final product couldn't be serious or funny, having nothing for the critics or the connoisseur viewer (and maybe not much for the usual viewer as well!). So as a movie about the hidden world of strip clubs it is catchy but with little to present. As a thriller it's comic. As a remake of (All About Eve) it's a bit sleazy but Hot ! And as entertaining movie, it's boldly, dirtily and full timer sexy.(Elizabeth Berkley), who's a funny pretty actress by the way, said in interview while the shooting that she loves to dance; well it appears. She forgot mentioning loving  fame, money, and not selecting scripts strictly. However, she was maybe so strict when she selected this one, thinking that this would make her a number 1 Hollywood star, or another Sharon Stone, unfortunately the movie didn't hit the mark that Basic insect (for the same writer and director) did, and she didn't have yet roles as big or better (she didn't even have the chance to make a sequel !).Without much ado, we all know that the only rich thing here was the dances. I won't say (..and the sad matter that everything else was poor) considering that there wasn't anything else intended in the first place! It's not porn, or possible musical, it's in tasteless faraway area between both, being nothing but one long striptease of a movie which doesn't want to be high or artistic. And according to that it's distinct. Yes, rubbish got its lovers. And this movie got millions since it is sincere rubbish. Big part of its allurement comes from being seemingly another sexy fluff while it's surprisingly wilder. So it is cult for everyone doesn't believe that Hollywood can be that cheap (namely oversexed to die-hard extent), for anyone who loves erotic dances, and for anyone didn't go to a strip joint or experience a special lap dance before (or will !). In a word  (Showgirls) is about achieving fame and money through dealing with sex and violence; that pretty much sums up the story of the movie AND the movie itself !

But of all of the ones I have seen, I thought Jackie Brown was the best. This one wasn't even written by Tarentino. his one was written by Elmore Leonard, who wrote Get Shorty, 310 to Yuma, and others. You can tell because this film is genius. Jackie Brown is an incredibly smart film. Almost all of the characters are likable and there are a ton of great performances. The best are from Bridget Fonda and Robert Forster. Fonda plays Melanie, who lives with a gun runner(Samuel L. Jackson) on a beach. She also sort of lives with Louis(Robert De Niro) who has just gotten out of prison. I'll get back to the characters in a second. The film mostly revolves around Jackie Brown(Pam Grier), who is caught with money in a bag that isn't hers. She is put in jail, and she is soon the key figure in a plot between the police and Ordell(Samuel L. Jackson). I can't really tell you anything else about the film. The film is funny and has a lot of brains. You see some incredibly surprising things in this film. You see Robert De Niro smoking a bong and having sex. Yes, I told you it was surprising. The dialogue in the film is smart and the plot is interesting. I was engaged throughout all of this film. I have to read the book some time. This film has it all. It's got laughs, fantastic performances, and a little bit of romance. I forgot to mention another great performance in the film. Robert Forster's performance as Max Cherry, a bailout dealer, is so cool and nice. There is a somewhat romance between him and Jackie. Almost all of the characters in the film are likable. The film has a cameo of Chris Tucker, who, to me, made the Rush hour films. I like Chirs Tucker, but I wanted to see more of his character. This is Tarentino's best, and that is saying a lot. Quentin Tarentino is a fantastic director. I wish to see more of him in the future. I saw his most recent film, Inglorious Basterds, and loved it. I haven't seen a bad Tarentino film yet. I doubt I will. Jackie Brown is without a doubt, and great, entertaining film, filled with laughs, and is Tarentino's best.Jackie Brown****\/**** ","genre":null},{"date":"8 October 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I have seen most of Quentin Tarentino's films.
