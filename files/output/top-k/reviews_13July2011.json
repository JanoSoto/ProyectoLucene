There's a clarification at the end, but it's random and unwarranted. The final scene is an indelicate compromise in multiple ways, actually, including an inexplicable tonal shift that violates the emotional detachment of the entire preceding film, which was its principal charm. Ronin is truly about characters, where they are and what they do. It's just wise enough, for the most part, to view exactly who they are and why they do what they do as arbitrary and superfluous.The first scene is a complex opening sequence of connections in which the De Niro character scouts the bistro before entering. We take for granted he's about to assault those inside, but really he's merely meeting all the men that have been contacted by an obscure Irishwoman played by Natascha McElhone. Frankenheimer cashes in on that beginning for 10 minutes of unadulterated cinema. When De Niro finally enters, the scene is uncovered as simple style practice, but in a movie like this you keep to the here and now, and don't inquire too far into why they convene in a public location at all.McElhone has marshaled these five men to obtain an attaché case. We never find out what's in it. It's the quintessential MacGuffin, as defined by Hitchcock, the indisputable master of the pure chase picture something everybody's concerned about, while what it is isn't relevant. The case is in the custody of five to eight men, McElhone informs them, and the eponymous specialists work to pursue them to Cannes, Nice and other striking locales. Each encounter culminates in brutal carnage and whirlwind car chases, so that in reality the headlines would be screeching about infernos of terror and dozens of fatalities, while sure enough, to die in a thriller is to be over and done with.I take great pleasure in the movie. The actors are uniformly persuasive in their roles. The action seems less than sensible but it's never edited within an inch of any real tension like so many other action scenes of the '90s and since. Each chase is done with delicate command and skill, thus genuinely exciting. But the best scene might be one of the quieter ones, when De Niro's character directs others on how to extract a bullet from his side. The scene is punctuated by a line that De Niro manages to utter so that it's simultaneously funny and poignant You think you can stitch me up on your own? If you don't mind, I'm gonna pass out. It's not only atmospherically masterful and tense in a way distinct from all the action, but it's where we get the clearest sense of the ronin-style discipline presumably inherent in the film's characters.The late John Frankenheimer is recognized as a maestro of sharp suspense dramas, owing to his creation of the modern paranoid political thriller, having begun his career at the peak of Cold War politics. There's an idiosyncrasy in his visual style that's difficult to pinpoint yet which brings a charisma to the settings, making them seem like more than background. Here, with a first-rate cast, he does what is for all intents and purposes an engaging drill. Because he ends the film so unevenly, it's ultimately not really about anything. If it stuck to its clinical guns from first frame to last, it could've been something quite special to the action genre and its treatment in the 1990s, since it comes so close. The screenplay credits suppress the involvement of script doctor David Mamet, most of whose clipped, coded dialogue is distinguished immediately and through to the very last word, giving the film a deadpan, professional crispness that does not, alas, make it to the last frame.

Reverend Lowe's dream was one of the best nightmare scenes in a horror film, in my opinion. The chase scene between Marty and Lowe was suspenseful as well. Let's not forget about the music score. It made you expect to see all kinds of evil pop out of the darkness, not just a werewolf. Some of the slaying scenes were too campy, especially when Maine hicks try to hunt down the creature in the woods. Speaking of Maine hicks, most of these people spoke with southern accents. Why not change the setting to Tarker's Mills, North Carolina? Although the werewolf appeared sinister during the brief glimpses we're shown, it disappoints with its final appearance. The monster looked more like a grizzly bear to me. Still, the werewolves in Lowe's dream were well done and the graphic special effects were satisfying. There's an unnecessary narration done by an older Jane to give a poignant feel to the film. At least it wasn't annoying like Job's in Children of the Corn. The actor's were all outstanding in their performances, and I'd really like to give a round of applause to Kent Broadhurst as Herb Kincaid. You could see the anger and pain beaming from his eyes. Too bad he couldn't have had a bigger part. The last thing I'll critique is Reverend Lowe. It's not Everett McGill's performance by no means. I give him extra credit for also donning the monster suit unlike most actors do as they portray transformed characters. It's the character himself that is lacking. We don't get to know much about him, and they leave out the book's explanation on how he became a beast. How can we be interested in the antagonist if he isn't fleshed out a little? All in all I enjoyed this movie, and I find myself thinking about it while taking walks in the woods at night. Silver Bullet is worth a view, but don't expect a classic.

Well, the lead male Don Mateo, is having dinner at a friends as the bourgeois often do when, lo and behold, a perfectly charming and quite delectable young chambermaid fills his glass with wine the wrong glass, silly girl. Don Mateo takes one look at this fetching young wench and the most basic instincts instantly take hold of him. He decides at that moment he must have sexual intercourse with this member of the opposite sex. As the old adage goes it takes two to tango she, she answers to Conchita, is not ready to dance. Whoa, she says and pushes him away. As with many men who understand their class advantages as a given, Don Mateo knows that he has something that adorable, sweet, sexy, Conchita badly needs - MONEY!! Conchita is no fool and her mother and the nuns who educated her have warned her, about being on her guard with men, who have their dastardly way, use her as a sexual convenience, and then go on to the next young sex conquest, She plays her cards close to her chest, and while keeping Don Mateo's libido flirtatiously in a state of excited anticipation, she leads him on a merry dance. The name of this dance is That Obscure Object of Desire, its 103 minutes long and its delightful to watch.The scene where she goes with him to his country house promising to deliver the goods, and then climbs into bed wearing a chastity belt, had me in hysterics and that's rare for me.

Luis, Breton would have been proud of you if he had lived to see that scene. Anyway, this delightful entertainment goes through umpteen twists and shifts, all maniacally clever, until the curtain comes down Unlike Hollywood endings both characters retain their integrity no depressing capitulation of will here.What an up this movie is, and so intelligent.

Nowadays, the movie's nonconformist themes may almost seem too basic, but in the '70s, cinema was all about revolution. It's about another one of those monumental, self-propagating domed cities we're all listed to start living in 300 or 400 years from now, governed by a female voice that may or may not be a supercomputer. This movie is set in a future as envisioned by the disco era, a style so beloved by its followers they must've seen it as prophetic. If you're thinking there'll at some point be a compulsory shot of a well-known Earth landmark now derelict, you are sure enough right.Michael York is Logan 5, a government button man in a control force called Sandmen who, much like the Sonderkommandos in Nazi concentration camps, acquire utmost social bonuses in return for imprisoning or incinerating any runners, old people of thirty who attempt to escape from state-required execution. Indeed, a youth-oriented world these people inhabit. Crystals entrenched in their hands vary in color with the fleeting years. The joke at the heart of the story is Life ends at thirty, literally. Everyone is beautiful, every need is accommodated.You enter a ceremony called Carousel, a dig at organized religion, in which you and others too old to live stand in a massive wind tunnel, get siphoned off to the ceiling, and blow up as your friends applaud. It's held that those who are thusly vaporized are reincarnated. The problem is, Logan is quickly advancing thirty himself, because of a particular assignment his mystifying leaders give him, and he soon has misgivings. Accompanied by a defiant Jenny Agutter, Logan chooses to flee for good to a mysterious, legendary place known as Sanctuary, past the arched ramparts of their sterilized metropolis.The miniature sets and models don't---can't---look that stunning by our modern CGI standards. Still, they complete a picture. Like the first Terminator film, less than state-of-the-art visual effects are almost more evocative of the state of mind out of which the film was borne than the antiseptic CGI of today. The introductory sequences in the totally insulated municipality are surprisingly absorbing, almost more for the astoundingly modern sound of the score, the city seeming like one of today's standard shopping plazas, and, remarkably, the hairdos of three hundred years from now look just like those worn forty years ago. People sport the guideline leotards and miniskirts, and coast around vast interior spaces. They don't appear to eat anything, while they drink stuff that's ostensibly nourishing, and when they want sex they simply link themselves to a teleporting computer dating service and occur in one another's bedrooms.York and Agutter traverse an irrigation system and encounter other sandmen. Richard Jordan costars as Logan's pal and fellow hitter, who determinedly chases him as he runs. We also find Farrah Fawcett-Majors included in the cast as an air head, and Peter Ustinov steals the entire film toward the midsection as a doddering old man. This is all well and good, though never do I gain any patent understanding of why this social order must operate as it does. Overpopulation doesn't look like an issue. And there's a chrome-laminated android who amasses humans in an ice cavern for no clear reason. But hey, it's post-apocalypse. So, you know, there. Regardless, however, it's a proficiently paced story with a distinct sense of threat.

People sport the guideline leotards and miniskirts, and coast around vast interior spaces. They don't appear to eat anything, while they drink stuff that's ostensibly nourishing, and when they want sex they simply link themselves to a teleporting computer dating service and occur in one another's bedrooms.York and Agutter traverse an irrigation system and encounter other sandmen. Richard Jordan costars as Logan's pal and fellow hitter, who determinedly chases him as he runs. We also find Farrah Fawcett-Majors included in the cast as an air head, and Peter Ustinov steals the entire film toward the midsection as a doddering old man. This is all well and good, though never do I gain any patent understanding of why this social order must operate as it does. Overpopulation doesn't look like an issue. And there's a chrome-laminated android who amasses humans in an ice cavern for no clear reason. But hey, it's post-apocalypse. So, you know, there. Regardless, however, it's a proficiently paced story with a distinct sense of threat.

General Hal Moore and Joseph Galloway who both participated in the Battle of the Ia Drang Valley in 1965, Randall Wallace brings the story to life in this superb film that doesn't hold back in it's portrayal of America's first major battle of the Vietnam War. Showing the battle from the perspective of both sides, the film offers a rare glimpse into the side of the North Vietnamese Army and together it helps create a very intense and personal film, as it also shows the wives of the soldiers back home on the Army base some of whom receive crude notifications of their husbands deaths in combat. Over three hundred American soldiers were killed in the battle that raged for almost four days. Both sides claimed victory, so it's still up for debate today who really won, although it does look like it was a stalemate. The Battle of the Ia Drang Valley was America's first clash with the NVA in the Vietnam War.Mel Gibson stars as Lt. Colonel Hal Moore, a committed soldier who fought in the Korean War and who is now dedicated to training the men of his regiment for combat in Vietnam. They are being sent into battle testing new equipment and tactics, much to Moore's trepidation. He is also a real family man and again finds himself having to leave his wife and five children behind. When his regiment arrives in Vietnam, they are ordered out into battle straight away to kill the NVA that attacked the US base. Moore and his just under four hundred strength regiment are being sent out into the Ia Drang Valley to hunt down an enemy they know absolutely nothing about, but know that they are trained and battle-hardened after defeating the French over ten years ago. When they land, the men of the 7th Cavalry Regiment find themselves on a flat area the size of a football field and also in the surrounding ravines and jungle, surrounded by thousands of North Vietnamese soldiers; and so begins the battle that would last almost four days.The first forty minutes or so of the film has no action whatsoever apart from a small bit at the start where it shows a French Foreign Legion patrol being ambushed in the 50's in the same Central Highlands that the 7th Calvary Remgiment would find themselves fighting in eleven years later. So the first part the film essentially is about character development and it allows us to care for these men and get to know them before they are sent into battle. Mel Gibson (Mad Max, Lethal Weapon) provides an often touching and powerful performance as Hal Moore, and the film also stars Barry Pepper (The Green Mile, Saving Private Ryan) as Joe Galloway, the journalist who arrives into the battle on the first night to help the people back home understand the war. Sam Elliott (Gettysburg), Greg Kinnear and Chris Klein are also amongst the cast along with a strong performance from Madeleine Stowe as Moore's wife.The action is savage and relentless. The superb cinematography puts us right into the battle, and the sound effects are top-notch as we hear the bullets flying and bursting overhead. You can feel the savage heat and almost feel the dust in your eyes as the soldiers run through the landing zone trying to repel attack after attack, all while a small squad who ventured out on recon before the ambush happened are cut-off and running out of ammunition with no way of getting back. In a very nasty and disturbing scene, we see a soldier burnt to a crisp but still alive after napalm is dropped on his position in a friendly fire incident. The last battle is superb and the music accompanying many of the combat scenes is very moving and fitting for the whole film. One complaint though, is the films sentimentalism and at some stages Gibson almost resembled John Wayne in Sands of Iwo Jima which gives the film that feeling at times that it's one of those extremely patriotic and unrealistic war films. But thankfully, that's only in some parts. I felt that they could have left out the parts with the wives back home going through the letters, it made the feel too soppy and sentimental and distracted us from the brutal and realistic war scenes being shown.

When it takes us inside the black, clawing mind of a beautiful young thug, it's almost captivating. When it takes that thug well into middle age and tries to use him as an example of being careful what you wish for, it's heavy handed and bull headed.The basic story is pretty simple. In 1968, a tow-headed tough (Paul Bettany) gets taken under the wing of a notorious English criminal named Freddie Mays (David Thewlis). The young gangster becomes part of Freddie's gang and enjoys the perks the English underworld of the late 60s had to offer. But while Freddie may be smart and tough and violent, his new recruit is something else all together. He's less a man and more a walking shark with a soul as dark and hard as a doll's eyes. The young gangster doesn't just want to be rich or powerful. He doesn't want to just take over Freddie's gang. He wants to become Freddie, to subsume him, to fill himself up with Freddie's worldly identity.The young gangster gets his chance and lives the life of his dreams for 30 years. But then the no-longer-young gangster (Malcolm McDowell) is confronted by his past and by what he's made of himself and his life. He is Gangster No. 1, trapped in an existence where that's important and tormented by a view of a larger, better world where it isn't.The stuff in this film with Paul Bettany is harsh and more than a little chilling. This is one of the better portraits of the blunt, selfish and somewhat stupid evil that makes up the gangster's character. These guys are not masterminds or super-villains. They are intense appetites, poor self-control and comprehensive self-absorption with no introspection. There's a sick fun to watching Bettany play a fledgling such creature, a little cancer that metastasizes through himself and those around him.Gangster No. 1 also looks really good with a quick pace and a strong focus to its story. Director Paul McGuigan confronts the audience with the abnormal nature of Bettany's character. He doesn't allow the viewer to look at him through a lens of escapism. McGuigan never lets you get comfortable with imaging yourself as the young gangster, no matter how sharply dressed or coolly powerful he may be.But whenever Bettany is replaced on screen by Malcolm McDowell, the whole production sputters. Firstly, you can get away with different actors playing a character at different ages, but not when you have other characters at different ages being played by the same actors. For example, when David Thewlis plays opposite Bettany's gangster and then has old-age makeup slapped on him to play opposite the same character now portrayed by McDowell, it looks inescapably silly. 60something Freddie Mays looks like 30something Freddie Mays with gray hair and wrinkles. Malcolm McDowell does not look like Paul Bettany in any but the most generalized sense. You could have had Morgan Freeman play the gangster in middle age and it would have only been slightly more distracting.The other problem with Gangster No. 1 is that when the gangster gets old, the story become all about how his life of greed and violence and decadence and material obsession has turned hollow and worthless and left him angry and empty and frustrated. But virtually nothing that happens in the gangster's young life establishes or foreshadows or sets up that little morality play. This movie is like watching a softcore porno that arbitrarily turns into a Christian diatribe on abstinence. It's all forced and fake and kind of puzzling.If you fancy violent tales about violent men, and don't mind if a capricious lecture on the downside of being a horrible person is injected into it, you'll relish watching this movie.

After all, it is a tremendously difficult job to express the sheer amount of emotion required, all the time, every time.Continuing on the subject of the actors, I was rather disappointed because I was expecting James Stewart to be the main character, yet he only showed up half way into the movie. I was quite interested to see him pull it of, not some guy I didn't quite know before, no offense intended to John Dall and Farley Granger, who deliver a very strong and intense performance. I mean... what happened? Did Mr. Stewart show up late for work and they switched roles on him? Or was he the Bruce Willis of the day, and he would've saved everybody? Not sure. A bit of false advertisement there.The script. The script is quite predictable and showing the murder in the first minutes didn't help matters, because it removed any uncertainty in the viewers mind, and because it also looked quite silly, if there can be such a thing as a silly murder.Rope. Incredible achievement from a technical point of view, but if I wanted to see a play I would have gone to the theater. 5\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"13 July 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" 'They Live' what can you say about this movie.

Yesterday, I decided not to 'watch' Chinatown but to 'pay attention to it', and I finally got why it is regarded as one of the greatest American films.As soon as Jerry Goldsmith's haunting score starts, a genre is resurrecting, a private-eye whose cigarette smoke harmoniously draws the hair of a femme-fatale, and a title announcing a haunting presence. Roman Polanski adapted the film-noir genre with a more modern touch  the first frames featuring pictures of very explicit sexual poses show how far we are from the Hayes Code, and the photographer is not the archetypal private eye, laconic, full of debts and booze. Jack Nicholson plays the role of J.J. aka Jake Gittes, a man who made 'private eye' his métier, perfectly organized, with two associates and a secretary, ironically earning his respectable money from the depraved lifestyle of the pre-war Los Angeles.Strangely, the first client almost disappoints as she's too unbelievably stereotypical. She's apparently a rich woman pretending to be Mrs. Evelyn Mullray, with an exaggerated aristocratic look. She suspects her husband, the Chief Engineer of Water and Power, of cheating her. We're finally reassured when the real Evelyn makes her appearance, but pay attention to the details she had to trick J.J. and makes him admit that he's never seen her, what could have been compromised if the two associates had warned him when he came. The script needed Jakes to enter with such enthusiasm he wouldn't let anyone talk, hence the hilarious Chinaman joke, and its embarrassing aftermath.Every detail, every originality, plays a significant role. Jakes takes one card from Mr. Yellburton of the Water and Power office and uses it later, to enter a protected zone. Even the details that are not plot significant, like when Gittes deliberately annoys Yellburton's secretary or asks a snotty office worker for a ruler, so he can tear a piece of paper and cover it with a loud cough, give an extraordinary sense of reality. The film doesn't even deal with an exotic statuette or a jewel heist, but the control of water, an unlikely subject that brilliantly comforted the 'mystery' element of the film as when a Chinese man tells Gittes that the water is bad for glass, and it takes a second meaning when you hear it again. Everything looks natural and unforced, but the perfectionism demands a concentration from the viewer, for a rewarding pay-off.The script is renowned for having been written by Robert Towne with Jack Nicholson in mind. Indeed, who else could have embodied such a cynical and apathetic attitude with this appeal, the way Gittes evokes his professionalism makes him even more charismatic as it justifies his insistence to solve the mystery, as stated in Polanski's favorite moment, when Jake and Evelyn appears in profile, face to face, with the famous bandage on Nicholson's nose and the priceless line I like my nose. I like breathing through it. Faye Dunaway is also perfect as the black widow whose sophisticated mannerisms, finely traced eyebrows and bright red lips, give her a misleading femme-fatale appearance, that couldn't let you guess that she's actually the heroine as the character with the most selfless motives. The whole film is full of illusions and contradictions illustrated by the perfect casting of John Huston as Noah Cross, the powerful mastermind, whose evil scheme is hidden behind his elegant courtesy and the funny way he always call Jakes 'Mr. Gitts'. A perfect casting that also includes Polanski as the 'Kitty Cat' midget.But behind Polanski's inside joke cameo, Gittes keeping this big bandage in his nose is the unforgettable trademark of the film, an ironic punishment and the warning to a man whose nosiness might cause bigger damages. And that's the power of Chinatown, the constant feeling of an imminent danger, embodied by this word  Chinatown. Towne, the Oscar winning writer of the script, asked a policeman what he did in Chinatown, he replied  As little as possible. If you wonder what kind of law enforcement that is, just listen to Gittes explaining that sometimes during Chinese gang quarrels, with so many different dialects, you never knew when you prevented a crime from happening, or when you were causing one, so the best thing was to do 'as little as possible' and visibly, there is a wound in Gittes' past, as he tried to help a girl, who was finally 'hurt', an obvious euphemism.Chinatown resonates as a resurgence of Gittes' past, with another woman he wants to protect, and the tragic irony is that we get the meaning when it's too late. And this is where I'm glad the movie was made during the 70's when directors were allowed to shock you with a dark ending. Polanski rightfully insisted that the movie needed to end tragically to be memorable and meaningful, he who lost Sharon Tate, in a savage massacre in that very town of Los Angeles. And the fact that Cross doesn't get his comeuppance makes him even more a creepier villain. The tragic ending was foreshadowed by many details that look even more symbolic after several viewings, Evelyn's strange spot in her eye, the moment where her falls on the horn, so we're prepared when he hear the sound again. It's those little details that make the difference.The movie ends brutally, but thanks to the perfection of Towne's script, Polanki's masterful direction and final personal touch, and a top-notch acting based on Nicholson-Dunaway-Huston triangular force, we understand the significance of Chinatown, and sure after such an event, Gittes' would probably become more cynical and more apathetic, but will he really forget another Chinatown?

The tragic ending was foreshadowed by many details that look even more symbolic after several viewings, Evelyn's strange spot in her eye, the moment where her falls on the horn, so we're prepared when he hear the sound again. It's those little details that make the difference.The movie ends brutally, but thanks to the perfection of Towne's script, Polanki's masterful direction and final personal touch, and a top-notch acting based on Nicholson-Dunaway-Huston triangular force, we understand the significance of Chinatown, and sure after such an event, Gittes' would probably become more cynical and more apathetic, but will he really forget another Chinatown? We sure won't ... ","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"13 July 2011","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" What I mean they is that I mean police.

I was so happy to find out that there was a movie about Richard Feynman. I have read a couple of his books, and I am totally amazed of his life. What he has achieved in science and what he has done outside science... he was such a character. To me, one of the most interesting characters I know.Everything begun well. There was certain quotes from Feynman's books that I expected. I was happy. But soon enough I realized everything was not OK... this was only a love story between Richard and Arline! No, there is certainly nothing wrong with a love story. This might be a decent love story between two individuals. But for people who know who Richard Feynman was, this must be a huge disappointment. He was so much more than this. He deserved more than this, and I still hope he gets a movie which is more than this.If you liked the movie and ended up wondering what else Feynman did during his lifetime, read his books (start up with Surely You Are Joking, Mr. Feynman). Even if you did not like the movie, but you want to know more about Feynman, read the book. If you are, or if you are not, interested in science, read the book.
