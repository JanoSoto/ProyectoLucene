[{"date":"27 March 2006","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This is apparently somewhat a remake of the old 1940 film, Little Shop Around the Corner, updated to the computer age. Having not seen the original, I cannot compare though found this a breezy enough, entertaining little comedy romance. The stars, Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, are as usual wonderful here, though for me, this venture didn't measure up to their earlier Sleepless in Seattle.It's a story that contrasts real life with the cyber world. Kathleen Kelly, the present owner of her late mother's little Manhattan children's bookshop, is having an affair but meanwhile corresponding on line with another man. Her e-mailing pen pal turns out to be (though unknown to her) none other than Joe Fox, the rather greedy, selfish son of the owner of a gigantic bookstore chain, Fox Books, which is moving into Kathleen's neighbourhood and putting her little family bookshop out of business. The pair are thus business rivals in the real world, but fall in love through their Internet correspondence. Joe eventually discovers the identity of Shopgirl (Kathleen) but not vice versa, so he sets out to befriend his pen pal in person.Not that this is intended as anything other than a cute little comedy romance, but the movie does have a couple of relevant messages. First, you never really know who's at the other end of cyber correspondence, so, as we're told to warn our kids, beware of who you might be revealing your life story and innermost thoughts to! Kathleen's on line pen pal is (apparently) quite a different person than the real life Joe Fox, and Kathleen of course has absolutely no idea as to whom she is pouring out her heart in these e-mails. Here, however, the point being made is that yes, the two really are one and the same person. Joe is simply revealing his more caring, sensitive side that doesn't normally show in his somewhat ruthless business dealings. He is not a one-dimensional, remorseless villain, thus making him actually quite a believable, realistic character.The other issue addressed is the extremely common tragedy in modern society of mega chain stores (with their huge stock and cheap prices) forcing closure of small family shops with their more personal service, cozy atmosphere, and limited but often more unique merchandise. Sadly, this happens in real life all the time.Of course there's a happy ending for this couple, but is it? Personally, I question whether or not Joe is really that right for Kathleen if, knowing how much her mother's shop means to her, he can still continue with the corporate dealings that force its closure, or how happy Kathleen will be longterm, realizing what her man has done. True, her employees will not be jobless but given positions with the new Fox superstore. However, it definitely won't be the same as the personal interactions they've been accustomed to with their former employer or the genuine interest these loyal folk have had in the success of Kathleen's little bookshop.All this being said regarding any deep meaning and the disappointing aspects of its ending, it is for the most part a pleasant, light hearted bit of fluff. These two stars are great on screen together and make for an entertaining little romance.

The story is centered around a young Indian woman (whom by the way, looks so realistic that she makes you question the reality of ever other Bollywood fluff you might have seen before this one) who is about to get married. The problem is, she has been having an affair with a married man, whom she loves. Her parents want her to marry the man of their choice, meaning that her marriage is being arranged. A few days before the wedding, she meets her lover for one last time and they are caught having sex in his car by the police. In fear of the consequences, the bride-to-be flees the scenes, abandoning her lover in the monsoon rain and driving off in his car. The next day, she comes face to face with the man she is to marry and his sincerity and freshness floors her to the point that she cannot see herself going on to marry him without letting him in on her past. Meanwhile, her family house begins to fill up with wedding guests, and some of them waste no time in hooking up with each other (despite being related or what not), while others steer clear of the looming dramas at every corner. The bride's cousin has a secret that is keeping her away from her uncle, yet she finds it hard to shut her eyes when she notices that the uncle has taken interest in her younger sister. This is another sub-plot within the film, that pans out through the end of it. There is also the sub-plot of the wedding decorator, a man who is so vulgar and so uncouth that he'll make you wonder why the family hired him in the first place. Anyhow, he comes to the house and falls in love with one of the maids within the home, their story is also told through to the end of the film. Something that bothered me though, was the scene in which the mother of the bride comes into her bedroom and finds her sleeping husband calling out the maid's name. That scene was never resolved but that just adds to the beauty of the film because it's just showing you how life truly is. It's not looking for resolutions or trying to sugarcoat anything, it's just providing you with a window into the lives of ordinary people living everyday life in India. There was another scene, though funny, that was kind of offensive; in it, the bride to be goes to visit her lover at his office, where a woman who does voice-dubbing for Bollywood films is being interviewed on a radio\/TV show and she is describing her next project to the viewers and listeners. The scene she is describing has to do with ad-libbing the sounds a woman would make during sex. It was just weird. Nevertheless, this film was stellar, it's an absolute must see for everyone and anyone seeking a break from pretentious, fake and delusional Bollywood fluff!

This one in particular has to be his most amazing work (though the academy didn't think so...wrong there). I have to admit when I had heard Oprah had done this film and won a nomination for her role of Sofia, I honestly thought it was because she's Oprah and this big star, and like an idiot I thought that fact helped get her the nomination, little did I know that she was one of my more favorite characters in any movie I've seen, she was amazing. Her performance has to be one of the best performances by an actress I have ever, EVER SEEN; how she captured the vivacious and full of life Sofia, who's life behind bars and as a maid, broke her spirit and will to move on dazzled me. I've never been more impressed by any actress than I was about her. I began to forget she is the multi-billion dollar woman who is on our televisions everyday and believed she was this amazing woman Sofia. All I have to say is Fantastic JOB O. Whoppi Goldberg blew me away, I love her comedy and her role in Ghost is one of my favorites, but her heart-breaking performance as shy, timid Celile has to be another one of the best performances I have ever seen. I just felt for this character so much, and just wanted to save her from her disgusting situation. Her timid smile and sweet personality captivated me and I fell in love with this character. She was and still is an amazing actress, but this film was one of her best. The rest of the cast of Danny Glover, Margaret Avery, and the rest of this amazing cast kept you in the story, thinking that this was a documentary with how realistic their acing was. It was the first movie I have to say gives you an almost true to life feeling of raw human emotion with its gorgeous cinematography, true to life characters and deep symbolic messages of hope and love. It was a shame and I think it completely wrong that this film was not given any Oscars or even a nomination in the Baftas because in my book this film is a masterpiece and should go down as one of the best films ever made. Mind you they say Citizen Cane is the best movie in the world and it did not win Best Picture, so I guess not all great films have to win an award to be a classic, but it still is a disappointing shame. I recommend this film to anyone, especially those who believe in hope and KARMA. Enjoy!!!!

It instead tries to provide us the viewer, an honest and realistic view into the average life of the average Scottish heroin-addict(s). It's all done in an unique and entertaining way and the movie is made with lots of style and humor. It doesn't make Trainspotting a terribly heavy movie to watch but more of a realistic, non-forced entertaining one.Perhaps the greatest thing about the movie are its characters. All of them are unique and fun in their very own way. This was Ewan McGregor breakthrough role and he perhaps plays his very best role out of his career. He is very powerful and credible in his role. A great main- and interesting character. Robert Carlyle plays a sort of Scottish version of Joe Pesci in this movie. He has some ultra-violent outbursts at times but for the rest of the movie he at the very same time is a lovable and hilarious character, that often works as a much needed comic-relief. Other fine roles are being portrayed by Jonny Lee Miller, Kelly Macdonald and Ewen Bremner.The movie does not only concentrates on what happens when you're a drug-addict but also what happens after you got clean. I love it that the movie also shows its honest and objective perspective, on this realistic story-elements. Nothing that happens in the movie feel forced or predictable and therefor everything that happens in the movie works out great and convincing.But honestly the movie is more entertainment than anything else really. The pace is high, the characters are silly and some of the situations and dialog are often hilarious. Trainspotting might seem like heavy stuff on first sight and even though it does have its serious and heavier moments, it remains mostly an entertaining movie to watch throughout its entire running time but yet at the same time, the serious anti-drug message comes through and works fine.Definitely a recommendable movie.8\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"27 March 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a totally honest film.

It does not try to shock or be confronting. It instead tries to provide us the viewer, an honest and realistic view into the average life of the average Scottish heroin-addict(s). It's all done in an unique and entertaining way and the movie is made with lots of style and humor. It doesn't make Trainspotting a terribly heavy movie to watch but more of a realistic, non-forced entertaining one.Perhaps the greatest thing about the movie are its characters. All of them are unique and fun in their very own way. This was Ewan McGregor breakthrough role and he perhaps plays his very best role out of his career. He is very powerful and credible in his role. A great main- and interesting character. Robert Carlyle plays a sort of Scottish version of Joe Pesci in this movie. He has some ultra-violent outbursts at times but for the rest of the movie he at the very same time is a lovable and hilarious character, that often works as a much needed comic-relief.

The master himself badmouthed it and considered one of his greatest failures due to the confusion the plot seemed to generate in its release. The fact that it was followed by the tremendous Strangers on a Train made things harder for this little overlooked gem.Despite this apparent bad luck, Stage Fright is a movie that displays the master's fine eye for film-making, and it even foresees the bright future Hitchcock had ahead at the beginning of the 50s. It's safe to say that this movie, along with Saboteur, are the roots of the most celebrated works by the Master. Works like North By Northwest, Vertigo or Psycho have an immediate precursor in these two often forgotten films.After a beautiful set of introductory credits that set the action in London, the movie starts quickly as we have Johnatan Cooper (Richard Todd) and Eve Gill (Jane Wyman) running away on her car. The problem Johnatan has been accused of the murder of the husband of the famous artist Charlotte Inwood (Marlene Dietrich). Since Charlotte was having an affair with Johnatan, all the clues point to him; however, and moved by her secret love towards her friend, Eve is convinced of his innocence and will do anything to prove he was set up by the treacherous Charlotte.Stage Fright wonderfully mixes the suspense with the dark comedy in a way that probably only Rear Window can match. Despite its apparently light-hearted tone, the movie has its fair share of complexity, proving how careful was the Master when devising a new film. Very in tone with the theater setting, Hitchcock plays with the appearances as the characters are not always what they seem to be. Double identities, lies and tricks come to play in this thrilling play set in London.Jane Wyman is superb as the strong willed Eve, who goes as far as to disguise herself as Charlotte's maid to find some information. Her ability to change her appearance is outstanding, and her skill for the comedy is something that Hitchcock really gave good use. Her performance as Eve must be one of the greatest (and sadly forgotten) in any Hitchcock film While Eve's investigation is filled with problems; she has the good aid of his witty and at times cynic father, played wonderfully by Alastair Sim. He is probably the defining character of the film, as he represents the classic Hitchcocknian mix complete with that famous British humor and his deep expressive eyes. He definitely steals every scene he is in.Probably Marlene Dietrich never had a great range as an actress, but in the right role she was devastating. As Charlotte Inwood, she gives one of her greatest Femme Fatale performances ever and one of the biggest proofs of her powerful presence. With this three outstanding performances, it would be understandable if Richard Todd is a bit overshadowed; however, his take on Johnatan Cooper is superb, and specially in the last part, his performance turns out brilliant.There are many good things to say about this film, as it has a lot of amazing details that sadly have gone forgotten.

Coming in that string of successful films of the late 1940s - 1961, LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON is probably less well known to modern audiences than SABRINA or STALAG 17. Yet SABRINA has a similar casting error. There Audrey Hepburn played the love interest between William Holden and Humphrey Bogart, ending up with older brother Bogart. Yet somehow that is more acceptable than here where she is love interest to Gary Cooper, who was only a few years older than Bogart.I think the reason is that Wilder's casting in SABRINA was more astute in one way - he cast Walter Hampden in what proved to be Hampden's best movie part - the elder Mr. Larrabee - father to Linus (Humphrey Bogart) and David (William Holden). Hampden looked old enough to be the father of both sons. But in LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON, Maurice Chevalier was (in appearance) about the same age as Gary Cooper. Chevalier played the father of Hepburn. It does not make Cooper's matching with Audrey Hepburn sit as well.A younger man was needed (one can suggest Tyrone Power, whom would subsequently pop up in Wilder's WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION). But Cooper did have one thing that makes his age problem seem less important than it should be. His public persona was that Cooper represented small town (usually western) America. He had won two Oscars for playing a Tennessee mountain boy who became a national hero in World War I (SERGEANT YORK) and an abandoned lawman in a 19th Century western town (HIGH NOON). He did play occasional sophisticates (DESIGN FOR LIVING; BLUEBEARD'S EIGHTH HONEYMOON) but those were atypical films. In real life Cooper was a socialite - he hobnobbed with upper class types. This is similar to that elegant roué Frank Flannagan. One can see Cooper fitting that part of the role quite well.So despite the apparent May - September romance, Cooper and Hepburn act as similar sophisticates and their chemistry is not bad. What would have been the result with another actor like Power or Cary Grant or Robert Taylor is hard to say - Grant had the sophistication, and Taylor and Power had developed high acting ability - but Cooper was the actual article.LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON is about a young woman, the daughter of a detective (Chevalier) who gets her excitement from reading the files of her father's client's cases. Frequently he is investigating the antics of the career of Frank Flannagan, an American millionaire who is so scandalously famous that the 1950s' scandal sheet magazine CONFIDENTIAL has an entire issue naming him Man of the Year. One client (John McGiver) upon hearing his wife is having an affair with Flannagan decides to shoot him. Hepburn manages to get to the hotel where Flannagan is staying first, and warns him. McGiver does charge in, but does not find his wife there.Flannagan is grateful, but finds that while Ariane is willing to see him again she won't tell him who she is. She shows up at the hotel quietly, after attending her music rehearsals at the Paris Conservatory, and manages to keep Flannagan totally in the dark. Then he leaves the city for a year. They meet a year later, and he does remember her - so they resume their relations. But Ariane is totally in love with him, and she wants to test him. She gives him a history of her sexual life, fully as garish and full of incidents as his. And it drives Flannagan crazy - crazy enough to contact Claude Chevasse (Chevalier) to locate this fascinating girl.The film has many lovely touches in it, from Chevalier's opening about how Parisians are always kissing to McGiver's whining to Cooper's band of musical gypsies who always end by playing Fascination before he has his sexual encounters. If SABRINA aimed at bringing Hepburn and Bogart to Paris in the end, LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON is a perfect follow-up with the characters in Paris itself. It is a perfect love valentine to the spirit of romance, leading to a moving and sweet ending that is narrated in part by Chevalier.Despite that casting problem LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON is a beautifully made romantic comedy.

Trevor's paying it forward plan works perfectly without anyone knowing it but everyone has to find out in a terrible way.I like who director Mimi Leder picked to play each part in this movie. I think Haley Joel Osment is a tremendous child star who did an excellent job in this film. Pay it Forward has so many things going on in it that are so important to the storyline that once it all comes together your like WOW. The idea of the movie is actually a brilliant idea in itself. I thought about it after I watched it and was thinking to myself Could this really work?. Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt do a superb job in this film as well. I don't feel that this film could have been as good as it is with any different actors; they jelled so well.I like Pay it Forward because it shows that just because someone is young and may seem to have crazy ideas, some of those ideas just may work. It almost made me want to go out and try the pay it forward idea of Trevor's. I love movies that have suspense and this movie definitely does. It does not have the same kind of suspense that an action film has but it has the kind of a sad, loving suspense of what will happen next with the little boy's life. So next time someone comes up with you with a crazy or strange idea, maybe you should just maybe consider it before totally blowing them off.

It's not very comfortable watching a film that shows sociopaths-- people born without the ability to feel guilt and empathise with others-- are born, not made and their dangerous traits are apparent even in childhood. 'The Good Son' revolves around Mark, a motherless boy of twelve who is sent to stay with his Uncle Wallace, Aunt Susan and two cousins, twelve-year-old Henry and six-year-old Connie. At first, Mark revels in the visit that takes his mind off his recent bereavement but he soon starts to realise that Henry is a sociopath whose parents are blind to his dark, violent side. It is a film that pulls no punches in just how malevolent Henry is and how easily he will pick off anyone who dares to interfere with his twisted sense of fun.Macaulay Culkin was excellent as the angelic-looking Henry whose boyish cuteness hide his true nature and his performance here proves he could have been one of the few child actors who graduated into a successful young adult actor had his personal life not been such a mess. It really was chilling seeing the child I was so used to seeing in comedies being so emotionally cold. But it is Elijah Wood's Mark who gives the film heart. Young Wood, only eleven years old when he filmed this, delivered a great performance as a young boy faced with the awful truth and desperate to stop Henry while juggling his grief over losing his mother. The scene where Mark is convinced Henry has poisoned the food is a perfect example of how Wood portrayed Mark's desperation, hysteria and helplessness in the face of his cousin's evil.However, one of the flaws of the film is that is a bit choppy, jumping from scene-to-scene without giving you a feel for the other characters, which is a shame because this is one film where you do need to have an understanding of just how Henry's nature affects all those around him and how he gets away with it all. I read the novelisation of the film by Todd Strasser before seeing the film so it's all the more noticeable for me. The book not only gives greater insight into Mark's budding fraternal friendship with Connie and his need to seek a mother in Susan but it also shows Susan's growing awareness to the monster Henry is and how she feels when she is made to choose between Mark and her murderous child.Overall, this film is enjoyable enough for a psychological thriller (although a few TV detective shows have done this idea in a slicker way) and it is nice to see a film that doesn't take a softly-softly attitude when dealing with the matter of children who kill. However, the ending was a bit of a cop-out as there could have been so many other avenues to explore had things ended differently for Henry (what should be done with sociopathic children? How do decent, loving families deal with such a child?). Those who do expect a bit more from their films will probably be disappointed.

I had expected better, given the combination of Lawrence Olivier's acting prowess and Neil Diamond's music, as I am quite a fan of both.This is definitely not Olivier's best role or his best performance either as the disapproving, disowning father, though he is a magnificent actor so viewer's expectations are high.

As for Lucie Arnaz, who plays the woman sharing his musical dreams, it's been awhile since I saw the movie and I cannot recall anything whatsoever about her role.

Neil Diamond is a great musician here as always, with songs such as Hello Again and Love on the Rocks.

In   those days before Britain had a civil partnership law, he was referring   to Gareth and Matthew, played by Simon Callow and John Hannah. Four   Weddings and a Funeral was among the first major films to feature a   gay couple without any comment, moralizing, or stereotyping.   Considering all of the absurd controversy generated by Brokeback   Mountain, this English comedy may be considered subversive in some   quarters, because it portrays the union between the two men to be as   loving and enduring as any between the men and a women in the same   film.    The two gay men are among a circle of idiosyncratic friends that orbit   around Charles, who suffers from relationship avoidance. Played   engagingly by Hugh Grant, Charles attends the weddings of others,   but manages to avoid any commitment of his own. One of the film's   funniest scenes involves Charles at a wedding reception where he has   been seated at a table with several of his ex-girlfriends. With that   one scene, screenwriter Richard Curtis wittily fleshes out Charles's   character as each woman remarks on her past experience.    The episodic comedy is broken down literally into the five events of   the title, and the core characters attend these events as spectators   who each hope for a wedding of their own. Many of the lines and   situations are extremely funny. Rowan Atkinson steals his brief time as   a novice preacher who blesses a couple in the name of the Father, the   Son, and the holy goat. Although Hugh Grant plays Charles as, well,   Hugh Grant, several other actors create some fine comic turns. The   ravishing Kristin Scott Thomas is touching as the lonely Fiona, and her   timing is impeccable when she recovers from an indelicate question with   a snappy comeback. Of course, why anyone as beautiful as Kristin Scott   Thomas should be unwillingly single is a minor casting flaw in the   film. Unfortunately, Andie MacDowell plays the American, Carrie, and,   although she looks great in a hat, she fails to generate the necessary   charisma to convincingly be Charles's object of desire.    However, the low wattage generated by the two leads does little to   dampen the hilarity or the pathos of this excellent film. While, at   nearly two hours, the movie is long for a comedy, the structure and   quirky characters easily sustain interest throughout.

It means so much to me; personally, cinematographically, visually&#133;It means so much when it comes to acting and wonderful performances, when it comes to fantastic original screenplays that come from a person's mind without being taken from anything we already know.This was probably one of the first movies to ever blow me away. When I was getting and idea of what cinema meant and which where the good films; this one left me impressed for more than a week. The same occurred later with Traffic, The Truman Show, Big Fish and others. It was with this film that I understood that to like a movie it has to mean something to you; besides meaning something for the ones who did it or the ones involved in it.It meant something for me mainly because of the music. It was during the main credits written by hand in a paper that I felt something, but then, when William's (Patrick Fugit) sister Anita (Zooey Deschanel) leaves the house to become a stewardess, and tells him Look under your bed; it will set you free; I was introduced to a new world.William's mother Elaine (an excellent Frances McDormand) raised him and her sister forbidding them to use bad words, making them go to school, making them religious, but most importantly not letting them listen to rock music. This all changes when William plays The Who's Tommy a the light of a candle. Some years later he is writing rock articles and he knows enough to talk with the best music critic in the United States Lester Bangs (a brilliant and Oscar-caliber supporting performance by the great Phillip Seymour Hoffman).They talk for a while and the critic says Well, I've got to go; I can't spend my whole day talking to my fans. But then, with a lot of intelligence, a camera shoots a restaurant, and they are both still talking. Bangs gives the kid an assignment to write about Deep Purple. The kid goes to the concert in his home town and tries to enter backstage saying he's a reporter of Creem.His multiple attempts fail and he is called by some girls who are laughing constantly. These are the Band Aids, and that is the moment in the film during which I fell in love with Kate Hudson. She plays Penny Lane (although that's not her real name), the girl who said women should be with musicians just for the love of the music, not sex or free rides.She plays her as an enigmatic and mysterious person who actually is lost and doesn't know or have another place to be in.

Now,when a film takes nearly 3 years to make,that's the very first warning sign that it's not going to work. Not to mention some publicized production problems I read about. Mariah herself stated recently on Oprah that she just wasn't good at saying no during the dizzying pace of her career in the 90's.

Hollywood's predominantly liberal elite, however, are often slightly uncomfortable with the doctrine; in the eighties many were at pains to point out that, whatever President Reagan might have thought, the evil empire in Star Wars was not to be equated with the Soviet Union, and more recently it has been denied that Lord of the Rings offers any tacit support to Bush's war in Iraq.Kevin Costner is sometimes regarded as one of Hollywood's more politically conservative figures, so it was therefore somewhat surprising to see him as the director, producer and star of a post-apocalyptic epic that explicitly rejects the just war doctrine in favour of a more pacifist view. The film is set in 2013 after a devastating nuclear war. Civilisation in America has collapsed and there is no more central authority. The survivors of the catastrophe live a quasi-mediaeval lifestyle in scattered agricultural settlements. The area in which the film is set (Oregon\/Idaho\/Utah) is dominated by a powerful warlord, General Bethlehem (the name is presumably an ironic joke) and his private army. Bethlehem and his men subscribe to a quasi-Nazi ideology known as Holnism. They are explicitly racist, exalt strength and power as the supreme good and despise mercy and compassion towards the weak.Costner plays a travelling actor (we never learn his real name) who makes his living by travelling from one community to another to entertain the people with performances of Shakespeare. He is conscripted into the Holnist army, but manages to escape He finds the uniform and mailbag of a dead pre-war postman and appropriates these in order to pass himself off as an official of a Restored United States, charged with a mission by the non-existent President Richard Starkey to restore the postal service in the American West. To his surprise, Costner finds that he is taken seriously, and local people volunteer to set up a new postal service to restore communication between their scattered communities. By doing so, however, they incur the enmity of the Holnists who see any restored central government or quasi-governmental agency as a threat to their own power and control of the area.The film appears to be leading up to a final showdown between the Holnists and the idealistic young men and women who have volunteered for the new postal service. There is, however, a surprising ending as Costner finds a way of resolving the conflict without all-out war. It was war which led to the collapse of civilisation; the best way of rebuilding it is not through the military heroism of taking on the bad guys at their own game, or even through the high culture symbolised by the Shakespeare recitations of the early scenes (Bethlehem himself turns out to be surprisingly cultured), but rather through the patient reconstruction of the amenities of ordinary civil society represented by the postal service. The symbolism of the postman is that he is a uniformed government servant, but one who carries no weapons and fights no battles.There are some similarities between this film and another anti-war post-apocalyptic drama, The Omega Man from the early seventies. Like Costner's character in The Postman, Robert Neville, the character played by Charlton Heston in the earlier film, was a man who brought a message of hope to a community trying to survive in the aftermath of a devastating war and fighting off attacks from a fanatical brotherhood. Neville, however, was deliberately presented as a Christ-figure, an analogy that is never explicitly drawn in The Postman. The look of the two films is also different, The Omega Man being set in the ruins of a deserted city, The Postman in idyllic Western scenery with pine-clad mountains. Costner's favourite film genre (and the one in which he achieved his greatest success with Dances with Wolves) is the Western, and The Postman, despite being set in the future, is very close to a traditional Western in feel.One thing which I have never been able to fathom is why this film should have aroused so much hostile comment from the critics and on this board. The organisers of that rather spiteful institution the Razzie Awards voted it not only the worst film of 1997 (beating genuine rubbish such as Anaconda to the award) but also the worst film of the decade. Perhaps some of the problem lies with Costner himself. He seems to have a well-developed Messiah complex, which may irritate some of his critics; in a number of his films, going back at least as far as Field of Dreams, he has portrayed either idealistic characters bringing a message of hope to the world or legendary heroes such as his version of Wyatt Earp. It is also possible that the failure of Waterworld, a genuinely bad film, may have prejudiced the critics against another futuristic Costner epic.The Postman, however, is not Waterworld. Not only is it not a bad film, it is a positively good one. Costner's acting may be an acquired taste, but for me he is one of the few modern actors with a genuine epic sense and the ability to convey the heroic. (He has this in common with Heston, another actor who often had something messianic about him). Dances with Wolves is his best effort in this heroic vein, but The Postman is, along with Field of Dreams and Wyatt Earp, another successful venture into the epic style. (He receives good support here from Will Patton as the fanatical neo-fascist Bethlehem). Certainly, his message of peace and reconciliation is an idealistic one, but idealism in the cinema is not always suspect. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 March 2006","score":"8 out of 14 people found the following review useful","review":" The just war theory &#150; the doctrine that under certain circumstances force may legitimately be used in support of a good cause- underlies many of Hollywood's most popular offerings, not just straightforward war films but also blockbusters such as the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings trilogies.

Dances with Wolves is his best effort in this heroic vein, but The Postman is, along with Field of Dreams and Wyatt Earp, another successful venture into the epic style. (He receives good support here from Will Patton as the fanatical neo-fascist Bethlehem). Certainly, his message of peace and reconciliation is an idealistic one, but idealism in the cinema is not always suspect. 8\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"27 March 2006","score":"8 out of 14 people found the following review useful","review":" The just war theory &#150; the doctrine that under certain circumstances force may legitimately be used in support of a good cause- underlies many of Hollywood's most popular offerings, not just straightforward war films but also blockbusters such as the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings trilogies. Hollywood's predominantly liberal elite, however, are often slightly uncomfortable with the doctrine; in the eighties many were at pains to point out that, whatever President Reagan might have thought, the evil empire in Star Wars was not to be equated with the Soviet Union, and more recently it has been denied that Lord of the Rings offers any tacit support to Bush's war in Iraq.Kevin Costner is sometimes regarded as one of Hollywood's more politically conservative figures, so it was therefore somewhat surprising to see him as the director, producer and star of a post-apocalyptic epic that explicitly rejects the just war doctrine in favour of a more pacifist view. The film is set in 2013 after a devastating nuclear war. Civilisation in America has collapsed and there is no more central authority. The survivors of the catastrophe live a quasi-mediaeval lifestyle in scattered agricultural settlements. The area in which the film is set (Oregon\/Idaho\/Utah) is dominated by a powerful warlord, General Bethlehem (the name is presumably an ironic joke) and his private army. Bethlehem and his men subscribe to a quasi-Nazi ideology known as Holnism. They are explicitly racist, exalt strength and power as the supreme good and despise mercy and compassion towards the weak.Costner plays a travelling actor (we never learn his real name) who makes his living by travelling from one community to another to entertain the people with performances of Shakespeare. He is conscripted into the Holnist army, but manages to escape He finds the uniform and mailbag of a dead pre-war postman and appropriates these in order to pass himself off as an official of a Restored United States, charged with a mission by the non-existent President Richard Starkey to restore the postal service in the American West. To his surprise, Costner finds that he is taken seriously, and local people volunteer to set up a new postal service to restore communication between their scattered communities. By doing so, however, they incur the enmity of the Holnists who see any restored central government or quasi-governmental agency as a threat to their own power and control of the area.The film appears to be leading up to a final showdown between the Holnists and the idealistic young men and women who have volunteered for the new postal service. There is, however, a surprising ending as Costner finds a way of resolving the conflict without all-out war. It was war which led to the collapse of civilisation; the best way of rebuilding it is not through the military heroism of taking on the bad guys at their own game, or even through the high culture symbolised by the Shakespeare recitations of the early scenes (Bethlehem himself turns out to be surprisingly cultured), but rather through the patient reconstruction of the amenities of ordinary civil society represented by the postal service. The symbolism of the postman is that he is a uniformed government servant, but one who carries no weapons and fights no battles.There are some similarities between this film and another anti-war post-apocalyptic drama, The Omega Man from the early seventies. Like Costner's character in The Postman, Robert Neville, the character played by Charlton Heston in the earlier film, was a man who brought a message of hope to a community trying to survive in the aftermath of a devastating war and fighting off attacks from a fanatical brotherhood. Neville, however, was deliberately presented as a Christ-figure, an analogy that is never explicitly drawn in The Postman. The look of the two films is also different, The Omega Man being set in the ruins of a deserted city, The Postman in idyllic Western scenery with pine-clad mountains. Costner's favourite film genre (and the one in which he achieved his greatest success with Dances with Wolves) is the Western, and The Postman, despite being set in the future, is very close to a traditional Western in feel.One thing which I have never been able to fathom is why this film should have aroused so much hostile comment from the critics and on this board. The organisers of that rather spiteful institution the Razzie Awards voted it not only the worst film of 1997 (beating genuine rubbish such as Anaconda to the award) but also the worst film of the decade. Perhaps some of the problem lies with Costner himself. He seems to have a well-developed Messiah complex, which may irritate some of his critics; in a number of his films, going back at least as far as Field of Dreams, he has portrayed either idealistic characters bringing a message of hope to the world or legendary heroes such as his version of Wyatt Earp. It is also possible that the failure of Waterworld, a genuinely bad film, may have prejudiced the critics against another futuristic Costner epic.The Postman, however, is not Waterworld. Not only is it not a bad film, it is a positively good one. Costner's acting may be an acquired taste, but for me he is one of the few modern actors with a genuine epic sense and the ability to convey the heroic. (He has this in common with Heston, another actor who often had something messianic about him). Dances with Wolves is his best effort in this heroic vein, but The Postman is, along with Field of Dreams and Wyatt Earp, another successful venture into the epic style.

The previous released Marvel adaptation had been a film version of Captain America that was produced for a extremely low budget and ended up going straight to video, which was appropriate considering how terrible it was. There had also been an abortive attempt to produce a Fantastic Four film, but after the completion of the film, it was shelved when producer Bern Eichenger made a deal with director\/producer Chris Columbus to produce a big-budget version (which would take more than a decade to actually make it to screen). It was into this environment of calamity that emerged a film centered around a little-known Marvel character named Blade. Blade, a half-human, half-vampire who has devoted his life to destroying other vampires, didn't seem like a likely choice to bring some light to the Marvel universe, but it did and managed, in many ways to breathe life back into Marvel film adaptations.Written by comics aficionado David Goyer (whose personal collection of comics reportedly stretched into the thousands), Blade was a vehicle for Wesley Snipes, directed by a former make-up effects artist turned director named Stephen Norrington. The results, while not perfect, are rather entertaining for a action-driven comic adaptation. Blade starts off with guns blazing, featuring a high-energy action sequence in an impromptu vampire nightclub where vampires gather to feast on unlucky victims. The sequence is full of energy, some rather tense suspense at the appropriate moments and well-staged fight sequences.It is from here that the film's plot begins to unfold the world is secretly ruled by an ancient race of vampires who control much of the financial empire throughout the globe, manipulating humans and using some as their pawns. Blade, assisted by his mentor, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), a man whose family was killed by a vampire, hunts down vampires from city to city, desperately attempting to rid the world of this scourge. It is after a vampire bites a doctor involved in blood research, Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright), whom Blade attempts to save from becoming a vampire, that he finds himself drawn closer to his arch-nemesis, Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), who is attempting to translate ancient vampire text to discover the secrets of a all-powerful deity who will transform the world into vampires.Blade is not high-art, that is for sure. The film is not designed to change your life or make you think deeply about important issues. It is, however, designed to provide some entertainment for it's running time, and pulls it off fairly well. As with other films of it's type, when a complicated culture has to be introduced to the audience, an outsider is the perfect opportunity, and Karen Jenson provides that entrance into the world of the vampires, allowing for exposition that is not unrealistically placed. We learn a fair amount about the film's vampire world, and it proves interesting at times. However, this is first and foremost an action film, and Blade services that aspect well. Beyond the opening scene, there are several major fight sequences in Blade, all well choreographed and destined to get the adrenaline pumping. Director Norrington uses some stylization during the course of the film, including time-lapse photography, but doesn't overdo it like other films heavy on action in recent years.Wesley Snipes is strong in the role of Blade, making an indelible impression, even with limited dialogue. He looks the part of hardened vampire killer and wears the role well. Kris Kristofferson is good as his mentor Whistler, providing some necessary levity at moments and giving us a more human hero to latch onto when Blade proves a bit less than talkative. N'Bushe Wright is serviceable in her role, but proves to be a somewhat bland companion for Blade. Stephen Dorff gives a good performance as the villain, without going over the top.Blade is not quite as good as other Marvel adaptations that followed it in short order, such as X-Men and Spider-Man, but it is a decent piece of action film-making that does it's job well.
