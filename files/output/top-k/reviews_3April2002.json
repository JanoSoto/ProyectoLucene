It's human nature; we all want to feel, or at least believe, that we are always in control of everything that happens in our lives.  But, upon reflection, if that IS, in fact, what you think, then you're probably not being entirely honest with yourself.  Because unless you're Dirty Harry, or someone of that ilk (and take note, the key word here is `are,' not `think' you are), you're not really going to know how you'd react to any such situation until the moment of truth is actually upon you.  And it's that moment that director David Fincher enables you to experience, albeit vicariously, in `Panic Room,' a suspense\/thriller that very quickly takes you to a very dark place-- a place few have actually ever been or would care to go, if given the choice.  But, of course, when it comes to a situation like the one depicted in this film, that's the rub  You simply do not get to choose whether or not you want to participate.  And when you really think about it, it's a concept that is more than a bit disconcerting, to say the least.  Because whether or not you want it, if it happens, you are going to be confronted with that moment of truth; and in that moment, you will probably learn more about yourself than you've ever known before.\tAs the film begins, recently divorced New Yorker Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) is being shown a property, a spacious Brownstone Townhouse, which she ultimately decides upon and secures for herself and her teenage daughter, Sarah (Kristen Stewart).  They move in, and prepare for their first night in the new house.  What Meg cannot know, however, is that someone else has an eye on her house, but it has nothing to do with wanting to live there.  His name is Junior (Jared Leto), whom, as it happens, knew the previous tenant-- a wealthy, and apparently paranoid recluse-- more than just a bit.  He also knows (or at least thinks he does) that there is something extremely valuable hidden in that house.  And now that the previous owner has passed on, Junior wants it.\tToward that end, he recruits a couple of acquaintances, Burnham and Raoul (Forest Whitaker and Dwight Yoakam) to help him get it.  But as fate would have it, Junior makes his move on the very night that Meg and Sarah move into the house, which as far as Junior knows, is still vacant.  They break in successfully, but it all goes south quickly when they discover the house is occupied, a situation for which Junior and his gang have no contingency plans; and their hesitation enables Meg and Sarah to make it to a safe room-- the `Panic Room' of the title-- a virtually impregnable room built by the previous owner as a safeguard against intruders.  And with the aid of a closed-circuit video surveillance\/security system, Meg is able to monitor the movements of the trespassers throughout the house from inside her fortress, and she has no intention of emerging until they are gone.  But Junior is adamant; and he's not about to leave until he has what he came for.  And at that point, the standoff begins.\tIn his previous films (especially `Se7en') Fincher has established his use of a dark, brooding atmosphere-- pregnant with foreboding-- to enhance the suspense and drama of his story, and this film is no exception.  Night falls, and Fincher uses the oncoming darkness and the stillness of the house to create a sense of isolation that is the subtle beginning of the tension he will continue to build and maintain throughout the film.  He also uses some imaginative camera work, slowly exploring the house from the audience's point-of-view, which-- combined with Meg's initial apparent trepidation upon entering the panic room itself-- gives it all a pointedly claustrophobic feeling.  Those with difficulties in that regard, in fact, may experience some uneasiness during a good portion of this film because of it; and it simply demonstrates what a good job Fincher did in creating the setting he wanted, and which he uses so effectively here to keep you on the edge of your seat.  \tThe plot is fairly basic, with an inherently narrow framework within which Fincher must work; but he sets a perfect pace and has an inventive touch both visually and psychologically that enables him to take an average screenplay (by David Koepp) to a higher level in the finished product.  Considering the storyline, some of what happens is-- some would say predictable-- though I prefer to call it inevitable (granted, a thin line differentiates the two; in this case, however, I feel `inevitable' is more accurate), and there are some surprises, which Fincher uses to great advantage.\tIt's no surprise, however, that what really elevates this film is the totally convincing performance by Jodie Foster as Meg.  Long one of the best actors around, she has the talent and ability to turn any material she's given into so much more than any writer or director could possibly hope to expect.  What makes her so remarkable-- as she is in this film-- is not only the fact that she can create such a believable character, but that she can do it with such intelligence and resourcefulness.  You have but to look into Foster's eyes to realize how much is going on constantly behind them; this is one savvy lady whom you can readily believe is always one step ahead of everyone else in the room.  And she goes a long way in proving that true beauty is, indeed, more than skin deep; she's attractive to begin with, but in a pair of black, horn-rimmed glasses, she looks ravishing.  In the final analysis, `Panic Room' is Foster's film; and she makes it a satisfying cinematic experience for her audience.  9\/10.     \t\t    \t\t\t\t  ","genre":null},{"date":"3 April 2002","score":"5 out of 12 people found the following review useful","review":"  \tEveryone likes to think that they'd know what they would do-- without hesitation, yet-- if suddenly and unexpectedly confronted with a perilous, even life-threatening, situation.

For no real reason whatsoever, three nonconformist teens are brought to trial, one of which has an I.Q. that is somewhere in the 70s.  When he gives a very phony sounding confession, the trials begin with absolutely no other evidence to prove that the boys are guilty.

However, what I really can't get past is the guy's bizarre behavior and the impression that he left me with. The guy takes up a lot of screen time.  I know that the guy is a jeweler by trade and acting may not be his thing, but this is a DOCUMENTARY and while watching him, on more than several occasions I got a little confused. Yeah, the guy has some mental problems, he's on numerous medications, he's suffering from a brain tumor and he's going through some major grieving. But why does he act like he's been watching TOO much WWF?  His lines are straight out of a BAD movie and if this is how the guy really is, I'm staying the hell out of this guy's way.  Throughout the film there are several subtle (or not so subtle) indications that he may be a suspect. The fact that he gave one of the film-makers a bloody knife as a Christmas present more than proves that the guy is a little off his rocker.  He even admitted to having beat the child the day that he was murdered.Remember, there is absolutely NO physical evidence to pin on the accused and the only thing that got them there was a false confession given by a legally retarded teenager who had been interrogated for hours.

When he gives a very phony sounding confession, the trials begin with absolutely no other evidence to prove that the boys are guilty.  Throughout the film, we meet each of the deceased boys parents, the defendents, and the defendents' families.  Most angry of all are the parents of the Byers boy who was murdered.  Now, before I get started on the step-father Mark Byers, I really want to say that I can totally empathize with the guy and his rage is completely understandable.  However, what I really can't get past is the guy's bizarre behavior and the impression that he left me with. The guy takes up a lot of screen time.  I know that the guy is a jeweler by trade and acting may not be his thing, but this is a DOCUMENTARY and while watching him, on more than several occasions I got a little confused. Yeah, the guy has some mental problems, he's on numerous medications, he's suffering from a brain tumor and he's going through some major grieving. But why does he act like he's been watching TOO much WWF?  His lines are straight out of a BAD movie and if this is how the guy really is, I'm staying the hell out of this guy's way.  Throughout the film there are several subtle (or not so subtle) indications that he may be a suspect. The fact that he gave one of the film-makers a bloody knife as a Christmas present more than proves that the guy is a little off his rocker.  He even admitted to having beat the child the day that he was murdered.Remember, there is absolutely NO physical evidence to pin on the accused and the only thing that got them there was a false confession given by a legally retarded teenager who had been interrogated for hours.  Oh, and did I mention that his story KEPT changing?  Listening to Jesse Misskelly, the time that the boys were murdered takes place all over the clock.  Once, he states that the boys were murdered in the A.M. hours, then during broad daylight, then at night. I don't get it.  It didn't matter to the jury. Two of the boys still got life sentences and the other (Damien Eckols) got the death sentence. His crime is that he had a fondness for wearing black, had a bad haircut, and a slight interest in Wicca...Not a whole lot different from myself.  Anyway, there is also mention of another mysterious person who made an appearance in a Bojangles restaurant restroom, covered in blood. Oh yeah, that is another issue that is barely mentioned, and then dropped.After seeing this movie, I was still terribly confused and my questions were still unanswered, but I guess that is the sign of a good documentary.  I'm really glad that the film-makers stuck with the facts and never let their opions get in the way of making the film.  The sequel is also very good, but still leaves nothing answered.  Now, it's been several years since the first time I watched this but the boys are still in prison, still trying to get out.  I reccomend this film to anyone who has ever been criticized for their appearance.  It'll make you realize just how lucky you are, while questioning the justice system at the same time.

Leon is a wonderful film, yes, i agree with everyone else, you MUST see the integral version to fully appreciate it, it develops the story more, it gives more insight, and it might make the very late scenes where Leon talks Mathilda as if she was a lover rather than a young girl (you have given me a thirst for life..) easier to stomach when you see how they have bonded and developed together.**END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS**Both stars do a fabulous job, and Gary Oldman hams it up superbly... yes, very over the top, but isnt that the point? he is portraying a madman after all, they arent all silent calculating crazies like hannibal lecter. The action scenes aren't John Woo, they are still however excellent, a little far fetched.... maybe, but not as unbelievable as some would have you believe, in the circumstances, it was fairly believable the way Leon dealt with the SWAT team, and far more realistic than Rambo blasting his way out and killing them all would be.  You have to remember also that he wasn't a highly paid contract killer for no reason, he must have been good at his job. All in all a beautiful film, I urge you to see it and make your own judgements, but don't be put off by some peoples interpretation of the story, it isnt sleazy or dirty in anyway, its very innocent, and very well handled, and its refreshing to see an action movie with a brain for once, that addresses adult issues in a serious and gentle way.

There are many, they are big, and they are loud.  Wesley Snipes is again great as Blade, who seems a little more human this time out.  He seems more vulnerable this time around thanks in part to Blade's student\/mentor relationship with Kris Kristopherson's Whistler. Blade also has a new partner, Scud, who provides comic relief and helps move the plot along when it needs it.  Blade is also teamed with a team of vampire commandos.  The commandos were awesome for the screentime they were given, and I really wish that they'd been developed more.  Ron Pearlman really stands out as the vampire with the biggest grudge against Blade.  Snipes and Pearlman play well against each other in this movie.One drag on the movie, unfortunately, is Leonor Varela, playing the beautiful daughter of the vampires' supreme leader (one can assume he took over after the vampire council was destroyed in the first film).  She and Blade become a little too attached to each other a little too quickly.  Varela's acting ability doesn't add anything to the part.  She only sounds believable when delivering the all-important exposition that furthers the plot.Another problem is that the plot isn't particularly clever beyond its premise.  Beyond the idea that Blade would have to team up with vampires to kill even more merciless super-vampires, the movie pretty much writes itself.  None of the double crosses that litter the film come as a surprise, and you might find yourself wondering how Blade got himself into several of the dumb situations he finds himself in.Beyond those flaws, however, you are still left with an incredible non-stop action extravaganza.  Blades deadly skills have seemed to increased since his previous film, as have his arsenal of anti-vampire gadgets.  The props and design departments for Blade II certainly did an amazing job.  Also, thanks to computer effects, Blade moves faster and is more agile than ever before.Blade II is a very well done action film.  Although it does have a few flaws, those flaws DO NOT take away from the non-stop, fast-paced action of this movie.  Not as good as the Matrix, but one hell of a good time.

All riveted to the mind by Enio Morricone's score. Except for '2001 A Space Odyssey' I have never seen a movie that uses music and silence so effectively. The cinematography, score, editing and directing are all amazing and the acting is also strong - other reviews have given them the praise they deserve, so I will skip to why I only gave this film an 8.It's SO sexist. Not that the central female character is weak; on the contrary she's tough, pragmatic and clever enough to match any of the men in the movie. The problem is that too often she acts like a typical Western woman she seeks a strong man to protect her, and is always at the beck and call of the film's hard men. The attitude of the men is summed up when Cheyenne tells her to go out amoung the men working on the railway and, if any of them touch her backside, let it go because 'they've deserved it'. A little sexual harrassment is fine after a hard days work. This is probably a reflection of the era, but I saw nothing in the film to say that Leone didn't endorse that attitude. There is one particularly nasty scene where Harmonica seems about to rape the woman, but stops and tells her to get him some water from the well. Why is this so bad? Because our hero is shown as deliberately putting the woman in her place - basically telling her I could have had you and I could have you any time I want remember that. Be nice and do what I say. I found that hard to stomach in a 'good guy'.The other big flaw in the version I saw was right was, and I'll try not to give away any spoilers, at the end when a central character dies.

Renoir's film is light and fun, and is very interesting to watch for comparisons of 'moral standards' between France and Hollywood.By now, you probably know the story.  A sad little man gets involved with a prostitute and her pimp.

I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet, but needless to say, the endings between the two films differ in a major way.What makes SCARLET STREET so outstanding in my opinion, is that given the repressed nature of the protagonist, the film works better because of the changes.  You can better understand the pressures of what living as a human doormat has done to this man, and how coiled up he really is.  Edward G.

I know, there will always be those who will insist on seeing him as the cigar-chomping tough guy only, and won't accept him as anything else, but SCARLET STREET showcases his more subtle talents and his enormous range.

Hollywood films will always falter in comparison to other country's films because the industry's fear of offending audiences always dulls the blade of truth.

LA CHIENNE is virtually a comedy.  In fact, it begins with an introduction by puppets (!), so we know we're not to take the plot very seriously.  Renoir's film is light and fun, and is very interesting to watch for comparisons of 'moral standards' between France and Hollywood.By now, you probably know the story.  A sad little man gets involved with a prostitute and her pimp.  Hollywood toned down the fact that Robinson and Bennett were involved in a sexual relationship, and the ending of the film had to live up to Hollywood's standards of 'morality'.  I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet, but needless to say, the endings between the two films differ in a major way.What makes SCARLET STREET so outstanding in my opinion, is that given the repressed nature of the protagonist, the film works better because of the changes.  You can better understand the pressures of what living as a human doormat has done to this man, and how coiled up he really is.  Edward G. Robinson gives one of the best performances of his career, which is saying a lot!  I know, there will always be those who will insist on seeing him as the cigar-chomping tough guy only, and won't accept him as anything else, but SCARLET STREET showcases his more subtle talents and his enormous range.  Joan Bennett is pure charm and snake oil in this, and Dan Duryea out-weasels Richard Widmark in KISS OF DEATH in fact, I'll bet good money that the weasel toons in WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT were based on Dan Duryea's character!.  Hollywood films will always falter in comparison to other country's films because the industry's fear of offending audiences always dulls the blade of truth.  But, at least during the classic era of Hollywood, the talent usually made up for the story flaws.  What do you get when you put Fritz Lang, Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea together?

Only a few years after Oklahoma City and with September 11th still to come, the film with its resonances of terrible events, has an awesome topicality. The plot with its surprise ending has something of the deviousness of The Manchurian Candidate. As in The Firm we identify with the hero's feeling of entrapment when everyday surroundings and circumstances gradually begin to turn ugly. And yet the film, from its very opening sequence where the Jeff Bridges character discovers a badly injured boy wandering in the streets and rushes him to hospital, never really works. This is its problem; it starts frenetically and continues at fever pitch throughout. The director does not seem to understand the first thing about how to pace a thriller. The very best ones start quietly, albeit uneasily. Psycho, Don't Look Now and Les Diaboliques are classic examples. For tension to work there needs to be that gradual increase to fever pitch (Halloween) or the sudden stab of violence following moments of extraordinary calm (Psychoand The Birds). To batter the audience senseless from first to last is self-defeating. The director needs to go back to the drawingboard to study the best work of Hitchcock, Frankenheimer and Chabrol. Only then will he realize that what he has given us in Arlington Road should have been so much better.

Only a few years after Oklahoma City and with September 11th still to come, the film with its resonances of terrible events, has an awesome topicality.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"3 April 2002","score":"","review":"  In either the theatrical version or the director's cut (VISTA series), Tombstone is an exciting and historically accurate account of the Earp brothers vs. the Clanton's.  Unlike My Darling Clementine, Gunfight at the OK Corral and Hour of the Gun, we get a true pictures of the relationships and fates of the Earp brothers, Doc Holliday, Josephine Marcus, Katie Elder, Curly Bill Brocius, Johnny Ringo (probably) and Ike Clanton.  Moreover, unlike the atrocious Wyatt Earp, we get a suspenseful, actionpacked and COHERENT storyline.  We discover the Clanton gang of earlier films was actually a huge gang (over 100) of outlaws known as the cowboys.  We learn that Virgil, not Wyatt is the real instigator behind the gunfight at the OK Corral and Wyatt a reluctant participant.  That gunfight is given its proper perspective rather than being the dominant event in Tombstone.  The male cast is mostly extremely good, particularly Val Kilmer (Holliday), Sam Elliot (Virgil Earp), Powers Boothe (Brocius) and Michael Biehn (Johnny Ringo). Unfortunately, with the notable exception of Joanna Pacula (Kate Elder), the female cast is pretty colorless. Especially disappointing is Dana Delaney as Josephine Marcus. There's nothing flat about Delaney, except her acting here.  One wishes, Joanna Going (Wyatt Earp) had performed the role in this movie.  Nevertheless, it's a mild disappointment in a mostly terrific movie.George P. Cosmatos' director's  cut is a BIG improvement over the original theatrical release.  Although only four minutes longer, his version provides much better context and continuity, particularly during the reckoning  portion. of the movie.  I would give the theatrical version a high 7, while the director's cut is clearly a 9.The VISTA series DVDs comes with a bonus disk with lots of great features and a reproduction map of the OK corral drawn by Wyatt Earp in 1919.  The VISTA series disk is only a couple of dollars more thanthe theatrical version.  It's a must for any collector of great and near great westerns.
