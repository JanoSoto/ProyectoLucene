I suppose it was OK for me to drool over her because I myself was about the same age as her when the movie first came out and yes, my eyes were eating the screen when she was on it. The creators knew very well what they were doing with the subject matter because they emphasize that stuff and make it part of the plot, especially in the extended addition of the movie. In the end they do keep it clean. In fact, while parts of the movie go to lengths in order to sexualize the situation, the other parts go equally far in order to keep the material palatable. For example, the main premise of the story is that Mathilda ends up living with and developing an affection for Leon the hit-man, played by Jean Reno. However, Leon's character is still a boy at heart, who never got to grow up due to the hardships in his life, which evens out the psychological levels of these two characters and makes the relationship more innocent and acceptable. Luc Besson's obsession is with showing distressed but strong hot women with guns that get thrown into the men's world. This creates a contrast like when a woman poses on a bike contrasting tender flesh against masculine machine. And Leon is perhaps the best of Luc's female experiments. In the movie La Femme Nikita it was a woman but she was at least a grown woman. In a movie like Lucy the character quickly becomes completely overpowered and the vulnerability factor is lost. In Leon, on the other hand, it really is a lonely little girl up against the mobsters - you cannot get any more of a contrast than that. Sadly some of the effect is lost due to the way Mathilda ends up being portrayed. This character as well as her relation to the world around her are interesting. Her interactions and chemistry with Leon are also interesting. The performance put Natalie Portman into the spotlight as an actress, but her dialogue is not great.Perhaps the single largest problem in the film is the dialogue. This movie has so much awkward, simplistic cheesy action-movie dialogue, pointing out the obvious and not giving the viewer anything deep to think about. It sounds like something that would be written by a teenage boy, perhaps for a comic book. Matilda's character suffers most of all because she sounds nothing like a kid of her age would sound (which I suppose is a problem more movies suffer from). Just take the title of the film, which is a typical example of this movie's writing. There is nothing wrong with just Leon, since that is a main character's name. But the full title of the film is Leon the Professional. The professional is just such a cheesy thing to put in the title, like something from a teenager's comic book or an 80s B action movie. The acting is great though. My favorite and never disappointing is Gary Oldman as the main baddie. It feels like this guy puts all of himself behind this performance. There are scenes in this film that make you wonder how close he came damaging his vocal chords or dangerously increasing his blood pressure. One could say that his performance gets very close to overacting, but he totally pulls it off. This is one of his best performances.The movie looks phenomenal. It has peculiar grungy look. When I was younger watching this movie dubbed in my language it left an impression in my memory that it took place somewhere in Europe even though it is supposed to be New York. People's sweating faces and the cramped apartments with their run down dirty walls combined with Jean Reno's French accent and shot in a warm sepia tone give this film a foreign look. Its looks have characterThe soundtrack of this film mixes very well with the visuals. There is a memorable crying violin theme and menacing heavy drums mixed in with atmospheric hums. Those violins give weight to the torment and I swear I could feel the heat getting heavier. If we want to find another problem with the film we have to go back to the girl. Look, for men who are not parents the whole age limit thing is bullsh*t, whether they would like to admit it or not, and by default guys are basically dogs, so parading a 12 \/ 13 year old girl in a choker is a cheap trick for a movie maker. Arguably, Leon is an exploitation movie. It just happens to be a very good one, but I feel like our guard is down when reviewing this film due to our mind having been affected by the material. It is like Nabokov's Lolita. Suuure you are reading the book just for its literary quality&#x85;This may calculate in your consideration when deciding which version of the movie to watch. The Extended Cut of the film adds almost half an hour of film with a lot of additional story that actually changes the meaning and dynamic of the movie. The added content is considerably more emotional, sexual but also silly and funny.

I agree, it's neo-noir, which is just as hard to define as noir. The story is definitely dark and the photography is dark and shadowy, as in the style of many such neo-noirs.This one has some definite faults, as I see it. And since they bother me, it's not going to be a favorite of mine. Actually, I view the film as pretty much a flop; my evaluation departs a lot from the IMDb 7.1. I really didn't believe in any of the characters. The story is also slow. It's about sex relations of a married couple with a fair amount of perversion, decadence and excess to them. This is not visual, mind you. It's more or less told to us by the narration of one of the 4 main characters, Peter Coyote, accompanied by just enough visuals so that we understand. The other 3 characters are Coyote's wife, the lovely Emmanuelle Seigner, and a married couple played by Hugh Grant and Kristin Scott Thomas.Grant and Scott are 7 years married, no children and no spark left, so they go on an ocean voyage, hoping to rekindle the blaze (passion). Coyote is paralyzed from the waist down, but before this happening, he was a man about Paris, living on inherited money. He had a torrid love affair with Seigner that went into some games and perversions by the two of them. She declares great love for him. He doesn't want her any longer so he treats her badly, very badly, not physically but insults and humiliations. She stays with him, though. Finally he dumps her and tricks her into a flight by herself to Martinique. He then uses his freedom for 2 years to get as much ass and pussy as possible. He has an accident. He's hit by a car and in the hospital with a broken leg when Seigner reappears. She pulls him off the bed and paralyzes him. Now it's her turn to treat him badly because he's dependent on her. Why he doesn't kick her out and hire a nurse is never explained. She needs to hate him. Eventually they marry, and now they're on this cruise too.

I didn't believe in Scott's character and how she reacted. I sometimes believed in Coyote's character and at other times not. At critical and serious instances, he seemed almost to be joking around with his part. I didn't believe in the depiction of Coyote's affair with Seigner. It seemed that the screenplay really didn't prepare the way for making the characters real enough. It seemed like Polanski was more or less moving them around like sticks. Sometimes I felt that Polanski had introduced material merely for its shock value. I didn't believe the ending sequences.

Antonio Banderas plays his young rival and Julianne Moore a computer whiz with whom Rath teams up. Anatoli Davydov is also on hand.At a 132 minutes, Assassins is too long for what it is &#x96; a wall-to-wall action movie where someone gets shot every 1-2 minutes, at least during the numerous ultra-violent sequences. This would be alright if the story and characters were interesting enough to warrant such length, but they're not. Banderas shines in the role of Bain, the zealous murderous psycho, but being a murderous psycho means he will get no sympathy from the viewer, otherwise he wouldn't be a murderous psycho. The characters played by Stallone and Moore are more sympathetic, but there's not enough detail to really care about them. Beyond that, the plot is convoluted even while the film is snappy. Despite the thrills, the story's just not engrossing enough to give a higher grade, but it's nowhere near as bad in this regard as, say, The Mummy Returns. In other words, Assassins moderately keeps your attention.And then there's the pile-up of implausibilities that are too easy to spot, like how does Bain not get seriously wounded by a bus while hanging out the window of a taxi? How does he emerge virtually unscathed from a fall from a third-story window after a great explosion? Even if the table protected his head and mid-section, what about his fingers and legs that weren't protected? How did he NOT break something from the awkward fall? Why does Rath blow valuable seconds looking for a dumpster to throw a suitcase with a ticking bomb? If you knew a sniper was waiting for you outside a bank, wouldn't you use the back door and then maybe surprise the assassin from behind? If someone pulls a gun on you, like at the end with Bain and Rath, wouldn't you automatically shoot first and ask questions later? Lastly, the whole set-up at the end with one character waiting in the bank, another as a sniper in an abandoned hotel, and the other outside informing the one in the bank is the height of contrived.I realize implausible and contrived things happen in all action flicks, but the really good ones are able to get away with it because the filmmakers take the extra time to work out the kinks and make a truly compelling picture, like Terminator 2, and not merely string together a bunch of exciting action scenes with contrivances galore.

Antonio Banderas plays his young rival and Julianne Moore a computer whiz with whom Rath teams up. Anatoli Davydov is also on hand.At a 132 minutes, Assassins is too long for what it is &#x96; a wall-to-wall action movie where someone gets shot every 1-2 minutes, at least during the numerous ultra-violent sequences. This would be alright if the story and characters were interesting enough to warrant such length, but they're not. Banderas shines in the role of Bain, the zealous murderous psycho, but being a murderous psycho means he will get no sympathy from the viewer, otherwise he wouldn't be a murderous psycho. The characters played by Stallone and Moore are more sympathetic, but there's not enough detail to really care about them. Beyond that, the plot is convoluted even while the film is snappy. Despite the thrills, the story's just not engrossing enough to give a higher grade, but it's nowhere near as bad in this regard as, say, The Mummy Returns. In other words, Assassins moderately keeps your attention.And then there's the pile-up of implausibilities that are too easy to spot, like how does Bain not get seriously wounded by a bus while hanging out the window of a taxi? How does he emerge virtually unscathed from a fall from a third-story window after a great explosion? Even if the table protected his head and mid-section, what about his fingers and legs that weren't protected? How did he NOT break something from the awkward fall? Why does Rath blow valuable seconds looking for a dumpster to throw a suitcase with a ticking bomb? If you knew a sniper was waiting for you outside a bank, wouldn't you use the back door and then maybe surprise the assassin from behind? If someone pulls a gun on you, like at the end with Bain and Rath, wouldn't you automatically shoot first and ask questions later? Lastly, the whole set-up at the end with one character waiting in the bank, another as a sniper in an abandoned hotel, and the other outside informing the one in the bank is the height of contrived.I realize implausible and contrived things happen in all action flicks, but the really good ones are able to get away with it because the filmmakers take the extra time to work out the kinks and make a truly compelling picture, like Terminator 2, and not merely string together a bunch of exciting action scenes with contrivances galore.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"6 February 2015","score":"","review":" There is neither glorification or criticism of the gangster lifestyle in Scorsese's Goodfellas, despite the opening lines of Henry Hill's narration. At times it can seem almost alluring and seductive. Take the character of Karen for example, played excellently by Lorraine Bracco. One can pinpoint the approximate moment in which she becomes swept up in the lifestyle of Henry (Ray Liotta), right when she decides to hide a bloodied gun rather than go to the police as other girlfriends would do. Her voice-over from her first appearance is one of the film's only real insights into Henry's world from the outside world. From then on it's a slow process as she is swallowed into her husband's life. Some of it is subtle, like the line about the bag of money at the wedding and how no one would dare steal from the Mafia. In other instances she's shocked at what she's gotten into as we wake to see an extreme close up of a gun barrel pointed directly at the camera before she breaks down and realises she cannot do the deed. One of the film's pivotal and most famous scenes is the long tracking shot that takes us through one of Henry and Karen's first dates. They bypass the waiting queue for a nightclub, entering via the service corridors and travel through the kitchen and right up to the stage where they immediately are presented with front row seats and a table. The magic of this shot as Henry greets acquaintance after acquaintance illustrates the lavish lifestyle and prestige of his position even at a young age, and seduces us like it seduces Karen. In a similar scene, we are presented with Henry's POV as the long take and voice-over narration combine seamlessly to introduce us to Mafia members in a bar. The camera-work is slow, deliberate and precise; each member is hinted at being their own fleshed out persona, each with their own powers and lives, yet for Henry it's a very familiar process. The select few Mafia members that are shown to be in close correspondence to Henry are Tommy (Joe Pesci) and Jimmy (Robert De Niro), the three of them taking care of business in the opening scene. The ease in which the violence and brutality of their work slips between their mundane lives humanises and establishes the main characters as a family. One moment they are finishing off a murder and digging a hole for the body, the next they are having a meal with Tommy's mother. The opening of the film sharply paints a contrast when it is later revealed what they have done and where exactly they got the knife from. Compare the harsh ominous red lighting of the digging scene to the naturally calm dinner with Tommy's mother. The film's dialogue also makes similar comparisons which highlight the notion of family. There's a brief moment of tension between Tommy and Henry who comments on his funny nature, the same comment later mirrored as Tommy takes offense to Billy Batt's ball bustering. One ends in laughter, the other murder.Even in prison, a usually dark and dismal location, their ties are are strong as ever. They live like kings inside, getting regular shipments of fine gourmet food from bribed guards bread, salami, prosciutto, cheese, scotch, wine. It's arguable one of the film's calmest moments, the soft jazz vocals of Bobby Darin's Beyond the Sea accompany the scene as the four sit down and dine on better food than many on the outside can afford.

Henry gets up from the witness stand, walk across the courtroom and breaks the 4th wall as he directly narrates to the camera; I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook.

","genre":null},{"date":"6 February 2015","score":"","review":" There is neither glorification or criticism of the gangster lifestyle in Scorsese's Goodfellas, despite the opening lines of Henry Hill's narration. At times it can seem almost alluring and seductive. Take the character of Karen for example, played excellently by Lorraine Bracco. One can pinpoint the approximate moment in which she becomes swept up in the lifestyle of Henry (Ray Liotta), right when she decides to hide a bloodied gun rather than go to the police as other girlfriends would do. Her voice-over from her first appearance is one of the film's only real insights into Henry's world from the outside world. From then on it's a slow process as she is swallowed into her husband's life. Some of it is subtle, like the line about the bag of money at the wedding and how no one would dare steal from the Mafia. In other instances she's shocked at what she's gotten into as we wake to see an extreme close up of a gun barrel pointed directly at the camera before she breaks down and realises she cannot do the deed. One of the film's pivotal and most famous scenes is the long tracking shot that takes us through one of Henry and Karen's first dates. They bypass the waiting queue for a nightclub, entering via the service corridors and travel through the kitchen and right up to the stage where they immediately are presented with front row seats and a table. The magic of this shot as Henry greets acquaintance after acquaintance illustrates the lavish lifestyle and prestige of his position even at a young age, and seduces us like it seduces Karen. In a similar scene, we are presented with Henry's POV as the long take and voice-over narration combine seamlessly to introduce us to Mafia members in a bar. The camera-work is slow, deliberate and precise; each member is hinted at being their own fleshed out persona, each with their own powers and lives, yet for Henry it's a very familiar process. The select few Mafia members that are shown to be in close correspondence to Henry are Tommy (Joe Pesci) and Jimmy (Robert De Niro), the three of them taking care of business in the opening scene. The ease in which the violence and brutality of their work slips between their mundane lives humanises and establishes the main characters as a family. One moment they are finishing off a murder and digging a hole for the body, the next they are having a meal with Tommy's mother. The opening of the film sharply paints a contrast when it is later revealed what they have done and where exactly they got the knife from. Compare the harsh ominous red lighting of the digging scene to the naturally calm dinner with Tommy's mother. The film's dialogue also makes similar comparisons which highlight the notion of family. There's a brief moment of tension between Tommy and Henry who comments on his funny nature, the same comment later mirrored as Tommy takes offense to Billy Batt's ball bustering. One ends in laughter, the other murder.Even in prison, a usually dark and dismal location, their ties are are strong as ever. They live like kings inside, getting regular shipments of fine gourmet food from bribed guards bread, salami, prosciutto, cheese, scotch, wine. It's arguable one of the film's calmest moments, the soft jazz vocals of Bobby Darin's Beyond the Sea accompany the scene as the four sit down and dine on better food than many on the outside can afford.

It's far more effective than the Stephen King novel on which it was based, purely because it takes a more realistic approach to the material you can argue perfectly correctly that this is a psychological tale of terror in which all of the events take place in the minds of the protagonists. Gone are the living hedges of the King novels, elements which Kubrick rightly realised wouldn't translate to the screen very well (check out the '90s THE SHINING TV miniseries to see how they did).Kubrick's main beef with the film is that the Jack Nicholson character seems psychotic from the outset, a contrast to his rational character in the book. But Nicholson is what makes this film a real delight to watch; he's a fantastic psycho and probably the most entertaining cinematic psychopath, better even than Anthony Perkins's Norman Bates. Duvall and Lloyd are fine, of course, but it's Nicholson who makes this such a compelling production. Finally, Kubrick throws in plenty of creepy stylistic techniques, like the subliminal images and some truly grotesque imagery, which makes this a chilly, frightening classic and one of the best 'haunted house' flicks in existence.

It's all frankly rather laughable, although not without merit for those with a soft spot for '80s nostalgia.

Billy who deliverers groceries to the woman's house deep in the woods finds her. He reports it to Sheriff Todd Peterson(Nick Searcy). Todd and the town doctor, Jerry Lovell(Liam Neeson)go out to investigate it. Todd is not only the sheriff, but a good husband to is wife who suffers from anxiety. I believe, I never read the book so I am just guessing. Jerry(Neeson), is shocked because he didn't think anyone lived this deep into the woods. Once they are in the house it is very quaint, wood floors, wood furniture, it is very basic. They find the old woman who is laid peacefully in the kitchen with her arms crossed, and flowers over her eyes. Jerry can't believe it, he is in disbelief. There is no water, no electricity, or phone. How can anyone live like this, they both look around the small house and Jerry comes across Nell. She is scared, and seems to have been sheltered most of her life. She seems to speak in a kind of broken English or a type of her own language. Jerry believes she speaks this way because her mother suffered a series of strokes. Nell is a sheltered young woman with little knowledge of the outside world. Jerry knows he needs help with this case. Especially when he finds a letter written by the mother. It says God has led you here please take good care of my Nell. Jerry is upset after reading the letter, he goes into Charlotte for more help on the case. He meets a psychologist, Paula Olsen,(Natasha Richardson). He explains to her what happened. Paula is fascinated, she wants to bring Nell back into Charlotte to study her. At first Paula and Jerry bump heads, Paula\/ the other doctors want her in a controlled environment; to study her. Paula goes to extreme lengths for competency. Jerry says no way, he is blocking it. He has watched her, and realizes she can live on her own. He is fascinated by what she can do. Paula says differently, saying she can't even speak English; she speaks her own type of language. The competency trial gets blocked; and the board gives him a time limit on his progress with Nell. In order to understand Nell someone will have learn her language and help her open up.Paula is there to help with equipment to watch, listen, and work on her type of language. They take blood samples, realize Nell was a product of rape, and is the only survivor of Twins. They study her day and night, observing her while she unaware. They both continue to study her language on the houseboat Paula has. It is Jerry who opens up to her, to Nell he is her Guardian Angel. He works on understanding Nell Speak( her language). Jerry sometimes pushes the limits, like playing music. This scares her at first because she has never heard it. He also wants her to realize that not all men are evil doers. She believes this because of her mom's rape. I believe this is one major reason why she stays inside during the day. Nell is remarkable she comes out at night, swims, and seems very capable of anything. To start breaking her from being scared of all men, Jerry jumps into the river with her. Paula tells her it is O.K., he will not hurt her. The three of them start to form a powerful bond that can't be broken. The next step is to get her out in the day time. They begin with baby steps, teasing her with food. She is shy at first, but she begins to break free. Then they take her into town, she is mesmerized. She sees so much for the very first time, they stop into town and meet Todd and his wife, Mary(Robin Mullins). Nell bonds with Mary, and Mary begins open up. Nell, Paula, and Jerry go to the grocery, and Nell really opens up. She then wonders off to the local Pool Hall, where she gets harassed by Billy; and some of the other local boys. Jerry finally finds her; and protects her from being embarrassed any more. In fact Billy almost gets what he deserves from Jerry. Near the end of the movie some twists; and turns take place which are crucial to Nell's well being. Nell's court date begins; and Jerry proves to the court Nell is competent. Five Years go by,Paula and Jerry are a family, and a big get together happens at Nell house. Nell has progressed remarkably; she will never forget Paula; and her Guardian Angel-Jerry.This movie is excellent, one of Jodie Foster's best.

Paula goes to extreme lengths for competency. Jerry says no way, he is blocking it. He has watched her, and realizes she can live on her own. He is fascinated by what she can do. Paula says differently, saying she can't even speak English; she speaks her own type of language. The competency trial gets blocked; and the board gives him a time limit on his progress with Nell. In order to understand Nell someone will have learn her language and help her open up.Paula is there to help with equipment to watch, listen, and work on her type of language. They take blood samples, realize Nell was a product of rape, and is the only survivor of Twins. They study her day and night, observing her while she unaware. They both continue to study her language on the houseboat Paula has. It is Jerry who opens up to her, to Nell he is her Guardian Angel. He works on understanding Nell Speak( her language). Jerry sometimes pushes the limits, like playing music. This scares her at first because she has never heard it. He also wants her to realize that not all men are evil doers. She believes this because of her mom's rape. I believe this is one major reason why she stays inside during the day. Nell is remarkable she comes out at night, swims, and seems very capable of anything. To start breaking her from being scared of all men, Jerry jumps into the river with her. Paula tells her it is O.K., he will not hurt her. The three of them start to form a powerful bond that can't be broken. The next step is to get her out in the day time. They begin with baby steps, teasing her with food. She is shy at first, but she begins to break free. Then they take her into town, she is mesmerized. She sees so much for the very first time, they stop into town and meet Todd and his wife, Mary(Robin Mullins). Nell bonds with Mary, and Mary begins open up. Nell, Paula, and Jerry go to the grocery, and Nell really opens up. She then wonders off to the local Pool Hall, where she gets harassed by Billy; and some of the other local boys. Jerry finally finds her; and protects her from being embarrassed any more. In fact Billy almost gets what he deserves from Jerry. Near the end of the movie some twists; and turns take place which are crucial to Nell's well being. Nell's court date begins; and Jerry proves to the court Nell is competent. Five Years go by,Paula and Jerry are a family, and a big get together happens at Nell house. Nell has progressed remarkably; she will never forget Paula; and her Guardian Angel-Jerry.This movie is excellent, one of Jodie Foster's best. Liam Neeson is remarkable as the caring doctor who wants to help Nell. Even though Natasha Richardson's character wants to jump the gun at first, by locking her up in a hospital. Richardson's character opens up as the film progresses. The movie is powerful, it tackles prejudices\/fear. It opens our minds to people who may have a disability\/sheltered, ETC.. All people deserve to be treated like human beings; and not like lab rats.THX, Kris L. CocKayne ","genre":"Drama"}]
