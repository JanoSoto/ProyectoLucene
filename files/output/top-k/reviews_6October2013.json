Unlike the first film, it has everything that made Star Trek special, and everything that goes into a great action movie, that even non-Trekkies can enjoy. The first movie lacked excitement, wit, wonder, thrills, a great conflict, likable heroes, humanity, and thrilling action. Star Trek is about characters and abstract science fiction (as a friend of mine once said). The first film was all about an idea about man and technology, with little to no humanity, and no deeper themes. The Wrath of Khan has everything one would want from Star Trek. The first film focused very little on the Star Trek we know and love. The first shot of this movie is of Spock, and you know we're back to Star Trek. The movie is about the characters we love, and their battle with Khan (Ricardo Montálban), an old enemy out for revenge on Kirk. Everybody feels like they did in the original series, and everybody feels human, rather than the dialogue deliverers from the first film. While this film is darker than previous outings of the franchise, it still has the wit and sense of wonder that is Star Trek. Rather than focusing on a single idea, the movie focuses on the characters we love. Khan is one of the best villains ever put on film. He's so brutal and evil, and yet he is sympathetic. Montálban's performance is amazing. He gets over-the-top at time, but he works with the script. As soon as you see him on screen, you know that he is a force to be reckoned with. He is also given a lot of great dialogue, such as revenge is a dish best served cold and of course, I have done far worse than kill you. I have hurt you, and I wish to go on hurting you. I shall leave you as you left me, as you left her, marooned for all eternity in the center of a dead planet&#x85; buried alive, buried alive. With a single look, Montalban can say a lot. I don't think I'm spoiling anything when I mention Khan's death. Most action movies kill off their villains. With his last breath, Khan vows that he will continue to hate Kirk after death. We don't actually see him die, but the look on his face right before he dies stays in your head. The cinematography is much better here as well. The first movie had very standard cinematography, which is disappointing coming from director Robert Wise (The Sound of Music). Every shot was plain (sometimes repeating similar shots for 5 minutes), and the colors were usually white and tan. Here everything is very colorful- the amazing effects, the lighting, and the new uniforms. This movie was the first to have a scene completely rendered with computers, and while it looks poor compared to today, it is amazing for 30 years ago. The score is also much stronger than the first film. Jerry Goldsmith is one of Hollywood's finest composers, and has composed great scores for movies such as Patton and Planet of the Apes. And in the first film, he composed one of the greatest movie themes of all time (it was later used as the theme for Star Trek The Next Generation). But other than that, the score was very weak. James Horner replaced him in this film, and brought with him a dramatic score that fits the mood for every scene. Very few films have drawn me in like this. Khan is possibly the greatest aspect of this great film. This isn't quite my favorite movie, but it's in my top 5.

It doesn't take long for the girlfriend (or the head) to wish that she was dead and then realize that she has a certain power. This film has the reputation as being one of the worst movies ever made and my opinion of it used to be quite low but after watching the 82-minute uncut version I think the film has gotten somewhat of a bad wrap. Yes, the idea of this head being alive and how cheaply produced the effect of that head is are quite laughable but for the most part this is right on the mark when compared to various other cheapies that were being made during this time. I will say that no matter how cheap a lot of the stuff is there's never really a dull moment here, which is kind of interesting considering we get a lot of dialogue scenes. Usually long, drawn-out scenes of nothing but talking kills a horror film but I thought they actually helped here and especially when the head is having a serious talk about her being alive with another man who also was victim to the doctor's experiments. The film, in its uncut form, also has some rather sleazy moments as well as some gory ones that help separate it from others of this era. With that said, there's no question that there are some moments here that should have happened throughout the film and I think this picture would be loved today. The mutant that finally shows up at the end is so strange and weird looking that I couldn't help but wish that he had been used throughout the picture. I think this here would have been much more effective had the producers used it. There's also no question that many of the performances are weak and that the film looks like it was shot on one set.

A Fistful of Dollars not only launched his career, but started a new era of Western films. And then came the superb sequel that was For a few dollars more. And as if that was not enough, Leone made the 3rd chapter of the story of the man with no name. And not only surpassed its predecessors but ended up being (maybe) the best westerns ever made.The Good, The Bad and The Ugly starts when Tuco (Eli Wallach), an Mexican outlaw, finds in the desert a Confederate convoy with all soldiers killed inside a wagon. But one of the soldiers was alive and tells Tuco about a certain treasure he hid in a coffin in a cemetery. Tuco goes to fetch water on his horse, to give to the soldier so that he could speak better, but when he is back the soldier died, and the only one who heard the name of the coffin was Blondie (Clint Eastwood) Tuco's former business partner which was being tortured by Tuco crossing the desert without drinking water because Blondie had betrayed him. Blondie knows the name of the coffin but it doesn't know the location of the cemetery, which Tuco does. Now both bastards have to work together to find and maybe split the treasure. But the mission becomes difficult when both meet Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) a lieutenant of the union army that knew longer about the treasure but it didn't know the name of the coffin. Now the three men who hate each other will have to join and across an America at war to find the mysterious treasure.And why this movie is (in my opinion) the best Western ever made? Again, it was the fault of Leone and the exuberant cast. What Leone made in this film, was bring was what was excellent in the first two films and put it all together in this masterpiece. From the 1st movie is the superb narrative that flows in history always perfectly highlighting their characters in the story with chilling and (believe it or not) reflective dialogs.And of course, Leone also destroys (in a good way) in his amazing direction. Giving not only spectacular and epic duels (which here contains the best ones of the trilogy), but also with breathtaking Italian landscapes serving as the Old West. Thanks to the success of the previous films Leone manages to give the film a huge magnitude, with gigantic landscapes and moments with beautiful scenery. Not only landscapes but presents us with one of the greatest cinematic battles, the Battle of Langston Bridge.But as I mentioned before, Leone uses his genius in both script and direction, giving reflective moments to the story. Not only humanizes his characters, but gives the film a huge critic to America using a Western cliché. This cliché is the civil war, if you look at most Western movies (especially John Wayne's ones) they always had as stage the civil war. And through it Leone makes his criticism. It comes in moments like when Blondie and Tuco met Angel Eyes, they had been imprisoned by Union soldiers. In this open-air prison, the Confederates soldiers are forced to play and sing songs against their will, while the guards torture other prisoners. Clearly a metaphor comparing the Union soldiers to the Nazis, but this is based on facts. In many prison camps during the war, there was heavy torture and even rumors of cannibalism. And even a time when Tuco unwittingly confuses Union soldiers to Confederates ones, because they were covered in dust. Another metaphor trying to say that no matter what side you are, everyone is equal.In performances the movie definitely surpasses its predecessors Clint Eastwood once again the badass as he ever was in the trilogy. In this film we can see more of his human side and clear, despite his schemes and greed, it has clearly a good side; Eli Wallach excellent. Maybe his performance certainly reach the performance of Eastwood, as this character that even with ugly attitudes have a pure side; Lee Van Cleef again superb now as the villain. But maybe he's the only bad thing in the movie.

This movie is greatly underrated that is irritates and even angers me sometimes. It's a very beautiful film that I think everyone should watch. I don't understand why it has such low ratings. Even without the romance, this movie would still be amazing. I have not yet found a thing I do not like about this movie. I'm actually surprised it doesn't have as high ratings as I thought. What a shame. Very good work done by the director and casting directors.

When the film isn't dragging, it does maintain decent interest with some explosive drama, and explosive bloodshed. A lot of it is more of the same (guy continues to morph into a fly-human hybrid, animals continue to get mangled by the teleporters, more digestive goo is sprayed liberally), but there are a few surprising twists to the thing as well (there's a certain scene involving an elevator that I found quite gnarly, and the ending is wickedly ironic).I never saw that much wrong with the story either. As a continuation that follows a new generation of characters, the story keeps a decent focus on the characters. It is pretty easy to relate to them, as they are effectively treated like lab specimens. That is also the source of the movie's drama and horror.

However, I didn't like how they portrayed Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christiansen) as a petulant child. This portrayal was carried over to the next movie where is always whining that it's not fair.Star Wars, Episode II Attack of the Clones adds onto the story the was started in Phantom Menace but takes place ten years later. Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) is no longer Queen of Naboo, instead she has been elected Senator. As Senator she represents the planet of Naboo in the Galactic Senate. Anakin Skywalker has progressed in his training as a Padawan Learner in the Jedi Order with Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) as his Master.Even though they portrayed Anakin as a whining child, I did like this movie.Of course there are scenes in this movie that I like more than others.The first scene I liked is when Anakin and Obi-Wan are chasing Zam Wessell (Leeanna Walsman) after her second attempt to assassinate Padme. The chase scene is pretty elaborate and kind of fun. In the end Zam is killed by another assassin before she can reveal anything to Anakin or Obi-Wan. The other assassin turns out to be Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison).The next scene I like was when Anakin goes in search of his kidnapped mother. He finds her just before she dies. In his grief, Anakin slaughters the Tusken Raiders who have held her captive. Anakin didn't just kill the men, he killed the women and children too. This is the event that begins Anakin's path to the Dark Side and to his new identity as Darth Vader.The last scene I liked in this takes place after Anakin and Padme are captured on Geonosis. They are taken to an arena where they are to executed along with Obi-Wan. They are joined in their fight by several Jedi, including Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) and eventually a clone army. At the end of the scenes on Geonosis Anakin has been wounded by Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) when his arm was severed.I give this movie an 8 out of 10 stars. The graphics were pretty good, especially Yoda's light saber fight with Count Dooku.

There were a few moments that were very good. I don't want to spoil the scene, but there is a particular moment that is very eerie and bone-chilling. One of the main issues with this movie is that it focused too much on what the evil force was behind the house. That is the same thing that hurt the second installment. The subtle creepiness of the original is what made it work so well, but this one seemed like it wanted to be a crappy Poltergeist sequel and fell flat. It was also odd that characters in the movie acknowledged the DeFeo murders, ignoring the Lutz family all-together along with the name change of the first family in Amityville II (Motelli). My only guess is that they were trying to suggest the first two movies were in-fact movies and this one was real, or they just forgot what continuity was. The acting was not that great, too many awkward pauses and poor delivery. I won't say this was the worst horror movie I've ever seen, but it is definitely up there.
