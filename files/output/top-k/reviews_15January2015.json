It is a smart movie that knows what it is doing&#x97;every conversation, every plot point is on theme. In a scene near the beginning, a legal team is discussing a book, a woman's fictionalization of her affair with a senator. The senator is threatening to sue for libel, but everyone in the room knows it's true. Next, a woman from the publishing firm (Glenn Close) and a married man from the law firm (Michael Douglas) extend their acquaintance over lunch. Their conversation, of course, quickly turns to indiscretions. This is effective set-dressing from screenwriter James Dearden, if you don't mind being peppered with an idea while it slowly comes to fruition. The movie takes its time to get to the junctures that we know must come, and which it so cleverly telegraphs. The titular attraction, with near fatality, play out in a steamy lost weekend that ends in a suicide attempt. The rest of the film is a tense period of escalation while we wait for the other shoe to drop. This stretch, too, is effective, as the film moves steadily out of the realm of family drama and into the horror genre. Maurice Jarre's score turns eerie and urgent as Douglas's character realizes that his actions have consequences, and that he has ransomed his perfect family to a woman bent on having him at any cost. But it remains rather obvious where things are headed, and if this isn't your first movie, it is possible to become impatient. A high point is the famous rabbit-boiling scene, as clinically executed as everything in the film. The rabbit was a pretty pet, kept only for a day or two, then slashed and drowned. The harrowing climax neatly mirrors this, but not before using a literal mirror in one of those stock horror moments where the killer suddenly appears in the glass. The trick is too old to work, as is the obligatory one-last-ending trope, the unkillable-killer trope. It's perfectly done, but it's too hackneyed. The script's original ending, which was filmed but rejected, is more original and fits just as neatly with all that has come before.Like almost all horror films, the villain here is the most interesting figure. That's unfortunate, because the real power of the movie is its message about family. It is a ringing injunction against the kind of vain, powerful men who cheat, men who gamble all that they have for no other reason than that they can. Douglas's character is asked twice why he strayed, and the fact that he cannot give an answer is one of Dearden's smartest observations. Nobody could leave this movie wanting to have an affair... unless, of course, they miss the point by focusing on Close's character. And that is easy to do. When the movie it ended, I went over it in my mind searching for clues about her life and her behavior. Why did she lie about her father? Did her miscarriage, if that story was true, trigger her mental instability, or was it a preexisting condition? Can someone so afflicted hold down a stressful publishing job, or was that some kind of ruse? Was she, in fact, none other than the woman who wrote a book about an affair with a senator? Perhaps she used a nom de plume, and that is why she was so certain that the woman was telling the truth. The questions and theories are endless. This is a tribute to Close's acting, but it is also a distraction from the real meaning of the film that it is wrong to cheat, not because you might cheat with an insane person, but because in cheating you yourself become the danger that jeopardizes the stability of your life and home. Fatal Attraction very effectively externalizes that danger, and Close makes the most of the opportunity to bring to life one of cinema's most indelible and tragic villains, but I cannot shake the feeling that Douglas's character gets off the hook a little too cleanly. All he loses, in the end, is a rabbit he never wanted.

If Forrest Gump, also a very good movie, hadn't come out the same year, I have no doubt that Shawshank would have taken top honors at the Oscars.At the center of the story is Andy Dufrense, a bank executive wrongly convicted of killing his wife and her lover. Our first impression of him is that he's a bookworm, a nerd, the kind of man who won't last long behind bars. But it becomes clear soon on that he is filled with a great inner strength, one that allows him not only to endure his ordeal, but to keep his sanity and his humanity.Andy soon befriends Red (Morgan Freeman), the prison's top scrounger. Having spent the last twenty years on the inside the walls, Red serves as the film's wise old man, giving Andy (and the viewer) the ground rules, dispensing advice, and trading in contraband. He's sympathetic and loyal to his friends, but being in prison has given him a cynical streak that grows as the movie progresses. He also narrates the story, and does a masterful job. There's neither a single line of unnecessary narration, nor any scenes where more is needed.Andy's skill with numbers eventually gets him in good with the guards, whose taxes he does. Before long, he enters the services of the warden. And once the warden begins a program of using the convicts as cheap labor- and pocketing the profits- Andy becomes one of the nation's best crooked accountants. As for the warden himself, he's an interesting character. He comes across a fairly benign, if somewhat self-righteous; his piety and talk of redemption contrasting with the actions of those under him. But as his schemes unfold, his villainous nature becomes apparent.I don't know if there has ever been a more realistic, more sympathetic portrayal of prison life and what it does to a man. In every scene, this movie tells it like it really is. It doesn't shy away from the brutal beatings at the hands of sadistic guards, or the horrors of prison rape. But at the same time, it remains tasteful, never stooping to the level of crass exploitation or violence for its own sake.Shawshank also gives the viewer a sense of the boredom and monotony that makes up the bulk of a prisoner's life, without becoming boring or monotonous itself. It also shows the feelings of camaraderie and close friendships that can develop between inmates. I've heard that the only bonds between soldiers in combat can compare to those between prison buddies, and based on this film, I wouldn't doubt it. The little things are perfectly captured as well the cigarette trade, the obsession with the female image- to the point that you'll watch the same movie a dozen times just for that one scene with that one actress, and of course the way that every man in prison insists that he's innocent and it's all a big mistake.Through the experiences of Brooks, the old librarian, we also see little known dilemma of so many long-term inmates returning to society. Despite all the hardships of prison life, the drudgery, the bad food, the loss of freedom, Brooks has become not only accustomed to, but dependent on life within the walls. After all the years he's spent at Shawshank Penitentiary he's forgotten the outside world, and the outside world, in turn, has moved on, becoming something completely different from what he once knew. All of his friends, his life's work, and his purpose are there in the prison. Inside, he's well liked, a learned man and intellectual among his peers. Outside, he's just an ex-con who's past his prime and not so steady on his feet anymore.A real measure of this movie's greatness is that so much depth is given, and so much sympathy generated, for someone who is really a minor player. His story is only a subplot, yet this film spends more time and effort characterizing him than many movies spend on their main characters.Another important theme is what confinement can do to a man's soul. After years behind bars, most of the inmate's spirits are downtrodden, if not broken. For them, true happiness is but a memory; hope an entirely foreign idea. Hope is dangerous. Hope can get you killed. Red tells Andy at one point. But Andy is not like the others. He clings on to hope, even when he has every reason to believe he'll spend the rest of his life in Shawshank. He's determined that no matter what, he will not let his spirit be broken.The ending is one of the best I've ever seen, and I wouldn't dream of giving this one away. I will say that nearly everything that's happened up to now has, in one way or another, led to this, and that when it's over, you'll be amazed and uplifted.Shawshank is right up there with the best of Copula, Spielberg, or Kurosawa. It's the kind of movie that can restore your faith in cinema. No matter how many lackluster sequels or half-baked packaged deals the studios come out with, there will always be the Shawshank Redemption.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"15 January 2015","score":"","review":" This movie is a true masterpiece, and it's a real pity that it never really got recognition and box office success it deserved. If Forrest Gump, also a very good movie, hadn't come out the same year, I have no doubt that Shawshank would have taken top honors at the Oscars.At the center of the story is Andy Dufrense, a bank executive wrongly convicted of killing his wife and her lover. Our first impression of him is that he's a bookworm, a nerd, the kind of man who won't last long behind bars. But it becomes clear soon on that he is filled with a great inner strength, one that allows him not only to endure his ordeal, but to keep his sanity and his humanity.Andy soon befriends Red (Morgan Freeman), the prison's top scrounger. Having spent the last twenty years on the inside the walls, Red serves as the film's wise old man, giving Andy (and the viewer) the ground rules, dispensing advice, and trading in contraband. He's sympathetic and loyal to his friends, but being in prison has given him a cynical streak that grows as the movie progresses. He also narrates the story, and does a masterful job. There's neither a single line of unnecessary narration, nor any scenes where more is needed.Andy's skill with numbers eventually gets him in good with the guards, whose taxes he does. Before long, he enters the services of the warden. And once the warden begins a program of using the convicts as cheap labor- and pocketing the profits- Andy becomes one of the nation's best crooked accountants. As for the warden himself, he's an interesting character. He comes across a fairly benign, if somewhat self-righteous; his piety and talk of redemption contrasting with the actions of those under him. But as his schemes unfold, his villainous nature becomes apparent.I don't know if there has ever been a more realistic, more sympathetic portrayal of prison life and what it does to a man. In every scene, this movie tells it like it really is. It doesn't shy away from the brutal beatings at the hands of sadistic guards, or the horrors of prison rape. But at the same time, it remains tasteful, never stooping to the level of crass exploitation or violence for its own sake.Shawshank also gives the viewer a sense of the boredom and monotony that makes up the bulk of a prisoner's life, without becoming boring or monotonous itself. It also shows the feelings of camaraderie and close friendships that can develop between inmates. I've heard that the only bonds between soldiers in combat can compare to those between prison buddies, and based on this film, I wouldn't doubt it. The little things are perfectly captured as well the cigarette trade, the obsession with the female image- to the point that you'll watch the same movie a dozen times just for that one scene with that one actress, and of course the way that every man in prison insists that he's innocent and it's all a big mistake.Through the experiences of Brooks, the old librarian, we also see little known dilemma of so many long-term inmates returning to society. Despite all the hardships of prison life, the drudgery, the bad food, the loss of freedom, Brooks has become not only accustomed to, but dependent on life within the walls. After all the years he's spent at Shawshank Penitentiary he's forgotten the outside world, and the outside world, in turn, has moved on, becoming something completely different from what he once knew. All of his friends, his life's work, and his purpose are there in the prison. Inside, he's well liked, a learned man and intellectual among his peers. Outside, he's just an ex-con who's past his prime and not so steady on his feet anymore.A real measure of this movie's greatness is that so much depth is given, and so much sympathy generated, for someone who is really a minor player.

As someone who did not fight in the Ia Drang Valley, my first question would be-- how would you know? I will say this movie seemed pretty realistic to me, and Hal Moore and Joe Galloway, the writers of the book and participants in the battle seemed satisfied with it, so I bet you it is pretty real. And already, this is a big plus for this movie.What I think might be off-putting to some people is that fact that the movie has some big stars--Mel Gibson, Sam Elliot, Greg Kinnear-- that we have seen a million times before. If the actors had been anonymous, I suspect that the movie would have seemed more realistic. Gibson in fact does his Georgia drawl pretty well, but loses it every so often in one of his Braveheart moments of pathos.Similarly, the musical score has a Scottish lament that seems bizarre for this movie. Are we still doing Braveheart?On the upside however, we get corroboration from the participants that the war scenes are pretty real, and they are BRILLIANTLY choreographed. Ever since Saving Private Ryan, these movies have gotten A LOT more graphic. We Were Soldiers has some utterly gruesome scenes in it that are probably quite true to life. Again, this is a big plus, since we don't want to remember the fighting as anything but something very ugly.Also, unlike some other Vietnam films, there are some believable moments involving two parties not often heard from the soldiers' wives and the enemy. Hal Moore's wife delivers death telegrams to the other vets' wives so that they don't have to receive them from the Yellow Cab company. I have no doubt that this was true, and the scenes are NOT melodramatic, they are heartbreaking.Similarly, one of the best characters of the movie is General An of the NVA. He is again terrifically believable as the sanguine commander of the enemy forces, and we see him as a clever, thoughtful and even compassionate commander heartbroken about the state of his country but willing to do what it takes to defend it. The mental duel that he has with Colonel Moore (Mel Gibson) also provides a terrific subplot.On balance, this movie is really worth it. In making a Vietnam movie that really tries to tell the story realistically, we get an excellent tribute not just to the US Vets, but also to everyone affected, even the Vietnamese foe.

These were the most famous words of Antonio 'Tony' Montana, a man who lived faster and harder than any other. He never backed down, never took anything from anyone, and broke every rule in the business. His ambition and his greed knew no bounds. Through cunning, ruthlessness, and sheer ballsiness, he shot straight to the top, and went out guns blazing. He got everything that was coming to him and more, but he destroyed everything he came into contact with, including himself. Scarface is his story, and it is magnificent.Al Pacino and director Brian DePalma have truly created one of the most arrogant, vulgar, irredeemable, mutha****s ever to appear on screen. Tony Montana is a man with no conscience, no morals, and no respect for anyone or anything. All that matters to him is what he wants, and how he can get it. He has one of the most explosive tempers I've seen since Raging Bull, and expresses himself mainly through the F-word. I lost count of his F-bombs somewhere after 100, and that was in the first 40 minutes. He's complete loose cannon, a guy who can't make peace or take orders.But watching his life unfold, revulsion gives way to pity. Yes, pity. Because even though achieves wealth and power beyond his dreams, he never finds happiness. Part of it is that he never allowed himself to be satisfied, never learned to enjoy what he had. His first boss, Frank Lopez, may have been a sleazy double-crossing jerk, but he knew a good thing when he found it. It didn't matter that his operation didn't extend beyond South Florida; he already had enough money that the hard part was finding ways to spend it. He lived the high life, and he loved it.But not Tony. No matter how much he had, it wasn't enough. There were new territories to conquer, new assets to acquire, and if he stopped to relax he'd fall behind. As far as he was concerned, the world and everything in were coming to him. But even when he had the millions, the mansion, and the biggest distribution system on the east coast, it still wasn't enough. Is this it? he asked his friend Manny, Is this what we worked so hard for? And deeper than that, Tony simply couldn't relate to or connect his fellow human beings. He had a trophy wife, family, and friends who'd been with him since he was a street hood in Cuba. But he drove away or turned on every one of them. Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer) was the love of his life, the woman he knew he had to have as his bride. But once he did there was nothing but bickering, short-lived passion, and cocaine. She'd have been better off if she'd stayed with Frank.And there's his sister Nina. He will do anything to protect her, to point of obsession. No man is good enough for his sister, and so no man will have her. And when he finds her with Manny, his oldest friend and trusted lieutenant, Tony shoots him without even a word. In one instant, with one bullet, he destroys the two most important relationships in his life. Really Tony only loved two things himself, and the nose candy. Seeing him towards the end, he's like a violent, drug addicted Charles Foster Caine, except that guy died of natural causes.Not that this is meant as a cerebral biopic. Scarface is one of the most graphic films of the 80's. There are knifings, hangings, a brutal killing with a chainsaw- thankfully off screen- and shootings galore, including the final battle royal at Tony's mansion. This is one of the bloodiest, most powerful shootouts in the annals of cinema. The moments leading up to it are incredible enough, and then comes an absolutely stunning climax of blood and bullets that will completely blow you away. Terentino and Scorsese would be hard pressed to improve on these final moments. If you're even a bit squeamish, stay away.

I remember have seen the theatrical cut years ago but now that it finally has it's Blu Ray release (so far only US region) I picked it up again to see the 121 minute version, the longest release, it even includes 3 minutes of deleted scene's so this release shows it all.Of course made in an era where horror was not done and horror was almost death this flick was overlooked and hated by a lot of geeks out there but have seen it in full glory I liked it somehow. You can easily spot that it was made by Barker just see the way men were dressed on stage, clearly a gay dressing. But what people made to turn their face away was the use of CGI. Back then when horror was outdated the effects used were laughable. And they still are if you look to this flick but luckily their are also on-camera tricks and effects. It never bored me and I did like the performances. Naturally, Nix (Daniel von Bargen) will remind you somehow to pinhead from the Hellraiser saga.

It may have John Ford at the helm and John Wayne in the lead, but hardly standard fare for either of them. There may still be hard working settlers, cowboys, Indians, a somewhat kooky supporting character for comic relief, and yes, a happy ending. But The Searchers is harder edged movie than either man usually made, with darker themes and a blurrier line between the good guys and the bad guys.The clearest indication that this is no Stagecoach or My Darling Clementine is Wayne's character, Ethan Edwards. He's ill tempered, quarrelsome , lacks any form of manners or tact, and harbors a very checkered past. The latter point is not unusual for a western, or a John Wayne character. From Ringo Kid to Rooster Cogburn, he's played plenty of men with skeletons in their closets. What is different here is that there's no attempt to distance Ethan from the more distasteful aspects of his past, or to explain or justify them. Nor is it ever stated exactly what misdeeds he's committed. Instead his past sort of hangs in the background, casting an aura of disrepute over him.And that's only the first impression. After the unseen Comanche raid that is the key to the entire story, we see more of who he really is. When he commits himself to a cause, he is all but unstoppable. He will do whatever he has to, for as long as he has to in order to bring back his niece, no matter how small his chances of success, and no matter what the cost to him or those with him. And though his cause is a righteous one, the same perhaps cannot be said for his reasons. For him his hatred of the Comanches and his all consuming thirst for revenge are motivations every bit as strong as his desire to rescue his niece.And as the film goes on, it becomes less clear whether rescue is really his goal. He keeps searching long past the point where even he expects Debbie to be alive, leading one to ask if his search has any real purpose or if he continues only because he is obsessed and can think of nothing else. And when it's learned that she is alive and well, this brings another question What exactly does 'saving' her mean to him? Because all this time there's been the unspoken fear that Debbie may not be the same person who was taken away. Ethan knows well that many captives who have remained long with the Indians have themselves become Indians; what settlers called the fate worse than death. With his burning hatred of all things Comanche, this possibility is entirely unthinkable and unacceptable. So the question on everyone's mind is this Would he rather see her dead than be one of them? The first time I saw this movie, I couldn't believe that he would ever consider that. I mean come on, it's John Wayne we're talking about. But this time, even knowing the end, I had no trouble believing that he was capable of this. You can almost feel his hatred for all things Indian, and his disgust towards a group of 'white Indian' captives seen earlier is unsettling in its intensity. Ethan Edwards is exactly the kind of bitter, obsessed, habitually violent man who would shoot down his own blood for becoming one of 'them.' He would hate himself for it forever after, but he absolutely would be capable of doing it.Jeffrey Hunter delivers another standout performance as Ethan's adoptive nephew Martin. In the course of the film he goes from an excitable, woefully naive adolescent to a grizzled veteran of the trail. Throughout it all he holds a desire to rescue his sister every bit as strong as Ethan's, refusing every plea to go home and make a life for himself. But although he may be every bit as obsessed and stubborn as his uncle, his motives are much purer. Everything he does is for the purpose of bringing his little sister home safe. He does his best to be Ethan's conscience, and he will do whatever he must to protect Debbie- even from his uncle.Beyond the acting and the themes explored, The Searchers is highly impressive visually. The color is lavish by fifties standards, the scenery is breathtaking (even if it has little resemblance to central Texas) and the Indian battles are both excellently staged and historically accurate to a great degree. In fact for a film of the period, The Searchers is remarkably true to history, doing very well in portraying the plight of captives and their families, and the herculean efforts required to recover them. Plus its frank treatment of white attitudes towards Indians at the time, and its mere acknowledgment that white people- especially women- could become Indianized was groundbreaking, even scandalous at the time.I won't say this is a perfect movie. I felt that the comic relief, although effectively done, was more than the story called for. I liked old Mose, but I'm not sure that such a lovably eccentric character really had a place in this movie. Nor did I think the wedding scene really fit, especially the over the top hickishness of the groom. And seeing that most of the Comanche braves were played by actual Indians, I have to wonder why they chose a German born actor to play chief scar. Every time he was on screen I couldn't get past the fact that he was obviously white.These are relatively minor caveats however. The Searchers is a landmark of the western genre, and much deeper than its contemporaries. Although I still wouldn't consider it Ford's best work, it ranks high on any list of westerns, and I highly recommend it to all audiences.

They first showed each other their acting prowess in this biting adaption of the Somerset Maugham tale of sexual awakening and the revelation that physical attraction doesn't always transfer smoothly into emotional attraction. As only part of the story is seen here, the story focuses on two of the major characters, but what is here is so divinely acted and brilliantly written that the shell of the entire story is good enough and certainly could have warranted sequels including the remainder of the tale.I always thought that at the beginning of her career, Meryl Streep truly resembled a very young Bette Davis, and in several extreme close-ups here, I believe that to be even more true. The fact that a good majority of Streep's early films depended on a variety of accents and that Bette Davis provided a totally believable cockney accent here was even more validation for my belief. Davis truly gave 150 percent of herself in creating this character, alternating between being rude and seductive, yet never lessening the fact that this crass waitress she plays is truly the epitome of the tramp, having only her interests at heart and incapable of love, even when facing the destiny of eternity.Davis's Mildred seems to have the inability to look at anybody straight in the eye unless she is doing one of two things, trying to seduce them or trying to destroy them. She is the epitome of the passive\/aggressive bitch, using men for whatever she can get from them, treating them like crap (which makes them seem to want her all the more) and finally turning on them when they make it clear that they have discovered what she's been up to all along. She goes after crippled medical student Leslie Howard with every gusto, practically ignoring him when he begins to gently flirt with her, then providing him with no type of commitment when he makes it clear that's what he wants. He wises up to her very fast, especially when he begins to see other women who are true ladies. Her predatory female obviously will destroy herself, but even then she can't resist the last ditch effort to try and bring him down with her!As for Leslie Howard's character, he starts off as a bit of a naive but isn't perfectly innocent, collecting paintings of nude women Mildred eventually harasses him about. He finds that his attraction to Mildred was a misguided case of lust and finds two true ladies (Kay Johnson and Frances Dee) worth his time more than trashy sexpot Davis. Alan Hale (Sr.) plays the gregarious rich man who steals Davis away from Howard and leaves her pregnant and very much in need. A scene between Hale and Howard where he shows him a picture of his real family ends up being very funny in an ironic way, but the fact that he pretty much leaves Davis and her newborn baby to fend for themselves makes Hale just another cruel cog in the wheel which shows the type of history which lead Davis's Mildred to becoming the cold female she turned out to be. In fact, there's not really an ounce of niceness here in scenes not involving Howard and the true ladies in his life.It's easy to see why this may not have pleased Academy voters in 1934 even though Davis got the best reviews of any actress probably in sound films up to that time. In the early-mid 1930's, the Academy only nominated three performers, and Davis's omission was quite the talk of the day. She won the following year in an obvious consolation prize for a similar film of a predatory female in Dangerous, even having the similar tell off scene which she did so brilliantly here and which mimics still repeat word for word to this day. While excellent in Dangerous, it really still was a repeat of what she had done here (minus the cockney accent) and lacking in the details in the script which made her mesmerizing here. This too obviously faced the wrath of the Hays code, updated this year, and that too could have influenced voters not to choose someone so obviously worthy of the award.

They first showed each other their acting prowess in this biting adaption of the Somerset Maugham tale of sexual awakening and the revelation that physical attraction doesn't always transfer smoothly into emotional attraction. As only part of the story is seen here, the story focuses on two of the major characters, but what is here is so divinely acted and brilliantly written that the shell of the entire story is good enough and certainly could have warranted sequels including the remainder of the tale.I always thought that at the beginning of her career, Meryl Streep truly resembled a very young Bette Davis, and in several extreme close-ups here, I believe that to be even more true. The fact that a good majority of Streep's early films depended on a variety of accents and that Bette Davis provided a totally believable cockney accent here was even more validation for my belief. Davis truly gave 150 percent of herself in creating this character, alternating between being rude and seductive, yet never lessening the fact that this crass waitress she plays is truly the epitome of the tramp, having only her interests at heart and incapable of love, even when facing the destiny of eternity.Davis's Mildred seems to have the inability to look at anybody straight in the eye unless she is doing one of two things, trying to seduce them or trying to destroy them. She is the epitome of the passive\/aggressive bitch, using men for whatever she can get from them, treating them like crap (which makes them seem to want her all the more) and finally turning on them when they make it clear that they have discovered what she's been up to all along. She goes after crippled medical student Leslie Howard with every gusto, practically ignoring him when he begins to gently flirt with her, then providing him with no type of commitment when he makes it clear that's what he wants. He wises up to her very fast, especially when he begins to see other women who are true ladies. Her predatory female obviously will destroy herself, but even then she can't resist the last ditch effort to try and bring him down with her!As for Leslie Howard's character, he starts off as a bit of a naive but isn't perfectly innocent, collecting paintings of nude women Mildred eventually harasses him about.

The movie starts right after the Easter Rising in 1916 where Éamon de Valera (Alan Rickman) was caught and imprisoned. With de Valera unable to direct the IRA from prison, Michael Collins took the lead and with his best friend Harry Boland (Aidan Quinn) organized several operations and assassinations that would weaken Britain's power over Ireland. In 1921, the British become willing to negotiate and Collins is sent to London to establish a treaty. He returns with a compromise, where an Irish Free State would be established, but the North and the rest of Ireland would be separated. This of course creates a conflict as de Valera is strongly against it, but after the Treaty is approved of by the Dáil, de Valera and his followers resign in protest. A civil erupts, with Collins (now Chief of Staff of the National Army) on one side and de Valera on the other one, but after the Battle of Dublin, the IRA has to retreat from the city. Harry Boland, who stayed on de Valera's side after the Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed, was shot by a sentry at the battle while trying to escape. Shortly after, Collins goes to County Cork to meet with de Valera, but is killed in an ambush Through the entire movie, there is a romantic triangle going on between Collins and Boland and a woman named Kitty Kiernan (Julia Roberts). At first, the woman did not really know which man she should settle with, but ended up with choosing Michael. This was probably one of the main reasons why Collins and Boland drifted apart and why Boland stayed on de Valera's side, instead of accepting the Treaty. After Michael's return from London, he proposes to Kitty who accepts, but unfortunately, Collins is skilled before the wedding happens. The last scene pictures Kitty crying at the news of Michael's death. The story is well-written and keeps more or less to the facts, even though of course there are some historical inaccuracies. That is to be expected from a movie that targets a large audience that is not very well-informed about Ireland's history and that is watching the film for the action and not for its historical value. The presence of Kitty, although a bit annoying in my opinion, is necessary as it provides a certain romantic relief from all the heavy scenes the audience is bombarded with. It would have been better if the audience got to know her better, since no reason of why both Collins and Boland are in love with her is provided. The acting was great, nothing more to say about that. I especially liked Alan Rickman who did a wonderful job portraying de Valera. Julia Robert's American accent does come through a few times, but it is not very noticeable. The actions scenes were good and the dark lighting provides an atmosphere through the entire film.
