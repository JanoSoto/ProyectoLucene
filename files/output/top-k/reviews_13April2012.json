His credo is that any lawyer who goes to court has failed, since his job is to settle OUT of court. The first half hour of the film sets up this world of nuisance litigation with a series of brilliant speeches that have the viewer off-center from the usual idealistic young lawyer trying to right wrongs nonsense so prevalent in legal dramas and so missing here. Yet, slowly we watch successful attorney Jan Schlichtmann (Travolta), as he pursues a big company accused of dumping chemicals, slowly evolve INTO the kind of legal crusader we have seen so often seen before, and this way some otherwise familiar courtroom drama takes on a fresh edge and provides greater interest that it otherwise might. And since the drama is based on a true story, it takes some surprising turns especially toward the end, as life often does and Hollywood does less often. An excellent script achievement and a very good resulting film.

Lorraine Gary reprises her role as the now widowed Ellen Brody who finds herself reliving the horrors of the past when a mammoth shark kills her son. Grief-stricken, she travels to the Bahamas to be with her other son, a marine biologist (Lance Guest), and his family. There she meets and falls for a carefree airplane pilot (Michael Caine). But just as she is putting her life back together, the nightmare of the past returns when her granddaughter is attacked by an all-too-familiar Great White. Determined to end the terror once and for all, Ellen sets out for a showdown to the death. The action and tension build rapidly to a shattering climax in this, the most incredible Jaws adventure of them all. And this time, it's personal!NO IT'S NOT, IT'S RIDICULOUS!This film is a must see for all the wrong reasons. It's one of those films that's so bad it's actually brilliant. Don't confuse it with such abysmal films like Independence Day, Armageddon or the truly obscene 2012, these pictures are just big-budget garbage that trivialises the subtext. No, what I'm talking about is a film that's has noticeably lost its way during filming. Whether it's down to costs, script changes, actor hitches or good old fashioned executive interference, a film that's so fragmented the bloody thing should've been abandoned.A good comparison I suppose is David Fincher's Alien 3; it's believed that three endings were filmed (I've even read many more scenes were filmed post-production) coupled with endless script changes, actors walking away due to other commitments and many production fines meant that filming became a nightmare.In Jaws IV something similar has clearly happened; what you see is a plot of such ludicrous incredulity that you cannot believe your eyes. Ignore MCA Universal Home Video's official film account because in one sentence the story goes something like this The great white stalks Chief Brody's widow to the Caribbean for a final showdown. Thereby inferring that sharks have scruples, can reason, have the ability to track humans on-land and can hold a grudge; I mean, I knew they were intelligent but c'mon?!!Okay, let's start with the main protagonist THE SHARK it's still a cheap prosthetic and in some clips the unobservant amongst you can see the vehicle driving the contraption; the observant should just be laughing and shaking your head. I don't think this 'glaring error' is meant to be included in the final cut, but whatever the reason for its inclusion, the Director didn't feel the need to 'fuzz-it' out. Perhaps he was contemplating suicide at this point! (Later edits have masked the mechanics, so try and get hold of an old VHS\/DVD of the original release and laugh out loud)ELLEN BRODY (played by Lorraine Gary) As wooden as a work-mate and as 'hammy' as Derek Jacobi in everything he's ever done! This was Gary's final acting role; I wonder, was she pushed or did she jump?HOAGIE NEWCOMBE (played by Michael Caine) I just don't know what to say; he dances in one scene, brilliantly awful (oxymoron for you) as ever!I'm going to sign-off now, but listen-out for Mario Van Peebles' (Jake) dreadful West Indian accent!The film doubled its money, so who am I to judge?Box Office (Source IMDb) Budget $23,000,000 (estimated) Opening Weekend $7,154,890 (USA) (19 July 1987) Gross $51,881,013 (Worldwide)Other rubbish, but unintentionally funny films are Shocker, Judge Dredd, Speed, Highlander, Backdraft, Rambo First Blood Pt 2, War of the Worlds (2005), Total Recall, Contact, The Abyss, Dracula (1992), The Time Machine (1960)...the 2002 version was 'rubbish' only, The Black Hole...oh my Lord they're endless.
