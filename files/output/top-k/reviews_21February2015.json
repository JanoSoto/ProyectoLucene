The Matrix was innovative, but inoffensive, and unquestionably, a game changer. It changed the way action films were made and it changed the way action films were written. Bullet time was a tremendous innovation that every action film used for a long time afterward. A technology that was built on and improved to the point that the effects used here barely look like a big deal. It was possible to make an intelligent action film with interesting ideas and have people pay money to watch it. Not that this one is especially endowed with intelligence. And while I've never heard someone give a testimony in church starting with (I'm imagining this being read with a deep southern accent) I was a sinner, until one day a friend invited me to a bible study where they used The Matrix to lead me to Jesus... the church certainly did get excited that this (admittedly unintentionally)had give them a mainstream evangelism tool, before they worked out in about 2007 that this wasn't all that mainstream any more.I encourage anyone to watch this and also Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, two movies that came out within a couple of years of each other and changed the way action films were made.

Mighty Morphin Power Rangers The Movie is very much non-canon to the show because of the suits, Zordon's look, Angel Grove being shot in Australia, etc. Heck, Turbo A Power Rangers Movie is like the only one that is canon because it serves as a bridge between Power Rangers Zeo and Power Rangers Turbo. Also, the production quality in both films are different. Lastly, there was an episode of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers where the Power Rangers get new Zords and becoming Ninja Rangers, and the name of the episode was called Ninja Quest as it was a retelling on what the movie did. With that said, the premise of the movie is the Rangers are participating a Charity Drive for the Angel Grove Observatory as they receive a call from Zordon, and warns them that Earth is in danger and that Ivan Ooze is about to return after being buried in an egg chamber 6,000 years ago. Unfortunately, Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa had already freed him and commanded him to destroy Zordon. The Rangers arrive too late as Ooze leaves them to fight his Oozelings, and entering the Command Center by destroying it as well as Zordon with him being outside of his time warp. The Rangers began to loose their power as Zordon is about to die soon, and Alpha sends them to a planet where they can get new powers. Ooze turns against Rita and Zedd and takes charge over the situation of the Rangers as he plans to brainwash the parents of Angel Grove as they dig up his Ecto-Morphicons to destroy not only Angel Grove, but taking over Earth. So its up to the Rangers to get new powers to save not only Zordon, but to save Angel Grove and Earth. I do remember watching this movie growing up as a kid, when it was on an old VHS copy that it really had Mighty Morphin on it as on later DVDs took it out. I hope this gets a Blu-Ray release for better picture (no DNR) and sound as well as a great amount of special features. Also, put Mighty Morphin back in. If I did a documentary for this movie, I would go into much detail about how the behind the scenes went as well as the issues. If Shout Factory did this besides me doing it, then it is all in good hands. Anyway, I thought this was a fun movie to watch. I do appreciate that the filmmakers were trying to make a high quality version of the show from being cheap, but now it looks dated which I will get to that in a second. I thought the cast did alright with their acting abilities, which I know everyone wants to poke fun of their acting. I know I can find some bad acting, but mostly I rather find is some good acting. So all in all, they did what they had to do. Paul Freeman who you may know him as Belloq from Raiders of the Lost Ark plays Ivan Ooze in the movie, and I thought he was good in it for being both evil and over the top at the same time. The makeup of him looks really good as well as the suits that the Rangers wore in the movie. The story itself was told fine, and I can tell that tone of the movie is trying too hard to be a dark movie but I give them credit for trying. Hopefully, the reboot can do something better with that as well as making it fun. I also do like Graeme Revell's score for making it suspenseful and exciting. I do enjoy the updated version of the Power Rangers theme song with Dreams by Van Halen and other songs that I enjoy. Bryan Spicer did a fine job directing the movie, but nothing more I can say about. I will say that the action in the movie is really darn good. Any flaws? Yes. I thought the movie has some good practical effects, but the CGI effects are downright terrible; they were probably good at the time, but now they don't anymore. I also would have love to see the original Red, Black, and Yellow Rangers in the movie if they had stay on the show instead of being replace. Also, I don't mind the movie being shot in Australia but could they get at least get the vehicles from America instead of fooling us with some Australia cars as if the wheels are on the left but not the right. There are some other flaws that I can point out, but that is all I got say. Nevertheless, the movie is both good and bad at the same time because all it is that it just wants to be a fun movie, and it really did; its no masterpiece but its a good one.

I understand why there's a segment of the fan base that abhor the Moore films for being as campy as they are, but his films really were some of my favorites when I was younger and the nostalgia alone keeps my love for them alive. But even I have to admit that THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN is undeniably the worst. When I was young and had trouble sleeping, I would pop this VHS in to guarantee I would be out cold within an hour. It's disappointing because there were a lot of cool ingredients gathered here to construct one of the coolest 007 movies ever but poor writing and shoddy pacing ruin it. It opens so promisingly; instead of the usual scene of James Bond (Moore) going to M for his latest assignment, he arrives to the news that MI6 has received a special package for our favorite secret agent &#x96; a golden bullet with 007 inscribed on the side. We're led to believe that the legendary assassin Francisco Scaramanga (Christopher Lee) has set his sights on Bond, and Bond is removed from any and all assignments until the situation is resolved. So Bond begins a search that will lead him from Lebanon to Thailand in search of the man with the golden gun to confront him. This would've been the coolest 007 adventure ever but the movie then sidelines all the cool stuff for a solar cell plot.This frustrates me to no end. The Scaramanga\/Bond plot would've been more than enough to create a cool adventure that breaks away from the normal secret mission trope and turn this into a more personal venture. Bond wouldn't be out to save the world this time; he'd be saving his own skin. But, as Bond follows the trail to Scaramanga, he discovers that it ties into MI6's current situation with a solar power expert who has created a device called a solex agitator that is apparently the most efficient solar cell ever created and could solve the world's energy crisis. This leads to detours that ruin the film's pace, causing a horrible sag in the middle where Bond is sent to die in a karate school (because the film is set in Asia so, you know, martial arts!) and then engages in yet another boat chase (though not as painfully long as the one we suffered in LIVE AND LET DIE). This is about the time when my attention drops and I tune out. The first 45 minutes or so of the movie are great and then it ramps up again in the final half hour when Bond arrives at Scaramanga's private island for the confrontation we'd all been waiting for &#x96; the world's greatest secret agent versus the world's most deadly assassin. But everything in the middle, especially all instances of Sheriff J.W. Pepper (yes&#x85;.he's back), and the clichéd villain lair (Scaramanga's solar power plant&#x85;totally unnecessary addition that comes with the solex plot) ruin what could've been something fun and different.THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN was Roger Moore's second film as James Bond and he had pretty much found his groove by now. He had the suave, debonair demeanor but his action scenes never felt genuine. Part of the charm of his era, in my opinion. As stated, I'm a fan. Our villain, Francisco Scaramanga, has the benefit of being portrayed by one of the coolest character actors ever, Christopher Lee. Of course, he's excellent here. I only regret that he's wasted when he becomes more of the prototypical Bond villain in the end with his master scheme of ransoming the solex technology from his massive island lair. Keep it small here, guys. Keep it personal. It would've been fantastic. His henchman is also one of the more memorable, Nick Nack (Hervé Villechaize). Scaramanga's diminutive French man-servant is just as deviant as his boss and, let's face it, just as cool. The movie's only failure in the character department is our Bond girl, Mary Goodnight (Britt Ekland). I'm hesitant to blame any of this on Ekland because this just comes across as poor writing. Goodnight is a fellow MI6 agent and she's absolutely worthless. She fails at just about every job she's given and her only objective over the course of the entire movie appears to be hooking up with Bond. She's a ditz who puts herself and\/or Bond in harm's way on a regular basis due to her lack of awareness, and she throws a tantrum when Bond beds Scaramanga's woman\/the movie's femme fatale, Andrea Anders (Maud Adams). Adams is a much stronger woman. Her character is stronger-willed but she's put herself in a dangerous position by getting in bed (literally and figuratively) with Scaramanga. She's great and it's no surprise the filmmakers brought her in again for OCTOPUSSY.THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN has a lot of problems but, keep in mind, I still prefer it over THUNDERBALL anytime. The what-ifs in my mind about what we may have gotten had the producers been willing to take some more chances and get a little more creative with the material will forever bother me. But the movie boasts some cool villains and beautiful (if not well-written) women, and I love all of the sequences set in Scaramanga's funhouse of death. This may be one of the weaker 007 adventures but I still can't bring myself to hate it. Mediocre, maybe. Horrible, nah.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"21 February 2015","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I am a self-confessed Roger Moore apologist when it comes to the 007 films. I understand why there's a segment of the fan base that abhor the Moore films for being as campy as they are, but his films really were some of my favorites when I was younger and the nostalgia alone keeps my love for them alive. But even I have to admit that THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN is undeniably the worst. When I was young and had trouble sleeping, I would pop this VHS in to guarantee I would be out cold within an hour. It's disappointing because there were a lot of cool ingredients gathered here to construct one of the coolest 007 movies ever but poor writing and shoddy pacing ruin it. It opens so promisingly; instead of the usual scene of James Bond (Moore) going to M for his latest assignment, he arrives to the news that MI6 has received a special package for our favorite secret agent &#x96; a golden bullet with 007 inscribed on the side. We're led to believe that the legendary assassin Francisco Scaramanga (Christopher Lee) has set his sights on Bond, and Bond is removed from any and all assignments until the situation is resolved. So Bond begins a search that will lead him from Lebanon to Thailand in search of the man with the golden gun to confront him. This would've been the coolest 007 adventure ever but the movie then sidelines all the cool stuff for a solar cell plot.This frustrates me to no end. The Scaramanga\/Bond plot would've been more than enough to create a cool adventure that breaks away from the normal secret mission trope and turn this into a more personal venture. Bond wouldn't be out to save the world this time; he'd be saving his own skin. But, as Bond follows the trail to Scaramanga, he discovers that it ties into MI6's current situation with a solar power expert who has created a device called a solex agitator that is apparently the most efficient solar cell ever created and could solve the world's energy crisis. This leads to detours that ruin the film's pace, causing a horrible sag in the middle where Bond is sent to die in a karate school (because the film is set in Asia so, you know, martial arts!) and then engages in yet another boat chase (though not as painfully long as the one we suffered in LIVE AND LET DIE). This is about the time when my attention drops and I tune out. The first 45 minutes or so of the movie are great and then it ramps up again in the final half hour when Bond arrives at Scaramanga's private island for the confrontation we'd all been waiting for &#x96; the world's greatest secret agent versus the world's most deadly assassin. But everything in the middle, especially all instances of Sheriff J.W. Pepper (yes&#x85;.he's back), and the clichéd villain lair (Scaramanga's solar power plant&#x85;totally unnecessary addition that comes with the solex plot) ruin what could've been something fun and different.THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN was Roger Moore's second film as James Bond and he had pretty much found his groove by now. He had the suave, debonair demeanor but his action scenes never felt genuine. Part of the charm of his era, in my opinion. As stated, I'm a fan. Our villain, Francisco Scaramanga, has the benefit of being portrayed by one of the coolest character actors ever, Christopher Lee. Of course, he's excellent here. I only regret that he's wasted when he becomes more of the prototypical Bond villain in the end with his master scheme of ransoming the solex technology from his massive island lair. Keep it small here, guys. Keep it personal. It would've been fantastic. His henchman is also one of the more memorable, Nick Nack (Hervé Villechaize). Scaramanga's diminutive French man-servant is just as deviant as his boss and, let's face it, just as cool. The movie's only failure in the character department is our Bond girl, Mary Goodnight (Britt Ekland). I'm hesitant to blame any of this on Ekland because this just comes across as poor writing. Goodnight is a fellow MI6 agent and she's absolutely worthless. She fails at just about every job she's given and her only objective over the course of the entire movie appears to be hooking up with Bond. She's a ditz who puts herself and\/or Bond in harm's way on a regular basis due to her lack of awareness, and she throws a tantrum when Bond beds Scaramanga's woman\/the movie's femme fatale, Andrea Anders (Maud Adams). Adams is a much stronger woman. Her character is stronger-willed but she's put herself in a dangerous position by getting in bed (literally and figuratively) with Scaramanga. She's great and it's no surprise the filmmakers brought her in again for OCTOPUSSY.THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN has a lot of problems but, keep in mind, I still prefer it over THUNDERBALL anytime.

Watching this movie 47 years after it was made is a curious experiment. I totally get why some think its a very significant film and captures the zeitgeist of 1967 and for viewers who are older and remember some of that perhaps it does.But if I may be so bold - looking at it now it is more of a curious relic where many of the elements that were significant in 1967 just look strange now.Dustin Hoffman may as well be a piece of wood throughout the whole movie. I'm not a fan of his acting and certainly his fame from this role has nothing to do with his acting skills since he really may as well have been asleep through the first half.As others have remarked the second half of the film is inexplicable and doesn't really make much sense.If the Ben character was sleep walking through the first half then having him wake up and decide to go stalk the daughter in part two of the movie might be progress but it shows he has learned nothing.In fact the character of Benjamin is perplexing all round. Surely if he has completed a 4 year degree at an Eastern university he would have some clues, some friends and some ambition but that is not in the script. Instead he is little better than a prop for his parents expectations. In 2014 if we see a character like that we would call him a loser and that is what he is.Sure there are some other elements about the film which are worth a mention and many others have remarked on this. The soundtrack, the cinematography and editing is all savvy and well done. However I think the reason why this film still resonates for many- especially older viewers is the subject matter and the exploration of what would have been taboo topics in 1967.I did like the final scene where the characters are on the bus and they seem to realise something has happened but they have no idea what.For me in 2014 however I mostly just liked the car. A classic Alfa Romeo and the biggest dramatic moment was when it was driven on the curb and nearly crashed.For those reasons this film is a flawed classic. I'm glad so many people like this film but there are much better ways to tell stories now and I'm also very glad about that.

The script is snappy and delivered like dynamite, the banter between Stallone's Tango and Kurt Russell's Cash is a lot of fun. The story on the whole while very silly and predictable but it doesn't really ever become dull and it is easy to follow, the standout scenes being the opening, which is one of those scenes that sets things up so well it makes one excited for what will happen next and the brilliant prison escape, the prison scenes in general are among the better scenes in the film actually. The action, while very over-the-top, is decently edited, cool and endearingly kitsch without feeling too much. Sylvester Stallone is charismatic and effectively low-key and shows that he is at ease in the action scenes, his comic timing while much criticised in general is pretty good here, while Kurt Russell is a witty, soulful partner, the two of them being a well-matched pair. It is not everyday where you see Russell in drag, don't worry it is not as weird as it sounds.Cons Tango and Cash does have problems. The biggest problem is that it falls apart in the final 10 minutes, an ending so disappointing that it's easy to bring the film down more than one notch. It loses the energy that the rest of the film has and it goes well overboard in the silliness factor, with the slapsticky final fight feeling out of kilter. The main villain Perrett's comeuppance is also very anti-climatically handled. Teri Hatcher is probably at her sexiest here but her acting feels vapid. More problematic are the villains, here are very stereotypically written(especially Perrett, the drugs baron stereotype has been done a number of times and nothing interesting is done here) and only Brion James, here looking as if he is having so much fun, is memorable. You'd think that Jack Palance, a master of suavity, deadpan and intimidating menace, would be, but here he gives one of his weakest performances but it is not helped by that he is very underused and that he is the most clichéd character in the whole film. Palance was a great actor, and excelled better than most in villain roles but this is a portrayal where he does try way too hard that he's almost pantomimic, it also manages to be quite bland compared to his usual standard.

This time, Al Pacino is not a fearless drug leader like Tony Montana, or not a old gangster like Carlito or not a smart, charismatic professor like Jack. He is an ambitious newspaper.In the movie, events are being processed slowly but with good music that suddenly comes, it does not matter how long it takes. The two guys, Lowell and Jeffrey; they lost everything until end but they were very brave, determined and they did not give up fighting.

This movie is focusing on Guildford Bombing, this movie is focusing on people who ere jailed that have nothing to do with that bombing. So, they were innocent in this case.

I rented it from Netflix because the local movie stores don't stock these oldies. I think that says a lot about the academy voters.

It dealt with, no perhaps I should say, it demonstrated some issues that are still a part of society. Maybe in 1955 it was okay to portray Italian mothers as overbearing. I doubt anyone would make a movie like that today. And of course most Italian people have intermarried and their life is not quite the same as the ones depicted in this movie. But it sure made Italian mothers look bossy and controlling.Martys mother is frequently after him to get married. he is 34 and she thinks he should have four children already. He meets a girl he really identifies with and suddenly mama doesn't like her. She isn't right for her boy. Marty is a hard working decent guy throughout this whole movie.

This is a story about justice and the law, and it's also incredibly poignant. I cried the first time I saw it. It takes place over about 20 years, which is somewhat incredible, and we get to be firsthand witnesses to Andy's time in jail over such a long period of time. This is especially great when you add in all of the supporting characters the movie has to offer, like Red, Brooks, and the Warden. I was actually sad when I first saw this movie, because when it finished I realized that I'd just seen the greatest movie ever and I would never be able to see it for the first time again. 10\/10.

These are just a few questions this movie brilliantly asks. And there is no sure answer. Watching this movie i was stunned how interesting and involving it is.

It's yes and no at the same. If there were no court, many soldiers would have followed by example of those who didn't fight (as it was their responsibility - they are soldiers), and they would have surely lost war, which would ended by deaths for millions. On the other hand, the court itself was just a reminder, of why war itself is the most inhuman thing of them all.Overall, one couldn't summarize this movie and especially it's ideas in one summary.

I have recently watched this movie again after last time when I was perhaps five. Overall, I give the movie eight out of ten as of the standard in 2015. So let's jump into the details.First, I like to talk about the cons of the movie. The movie features no Asian or Black actors or actresses. It may be appropriate and convincing in 1968, but certainly not today in 2015. Due to the lack of diversity, the setup of the movie seems more like a funny space sitcom rather than a futuristic exploration. Perhaps due to propaganda purpose, the US and English language are featured dominantly throughout the movie. Examples include the boarding check features a list of languages with English on top, but excluding some of the most populated languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Russian. The lack of diversity in the space and the ideology of the predominant role of the US in the space exploration era shows arrogance and ignorance of the filmmakers, therefore discredited the believability of the realism in the movie. The slow pace and the long pauses in the movie certainly do not seem poetic in 2015, but rather seem idiotic and pretentious. This is why the movie lost two points.Now, let's talk about pros. The movie is very realistic. It carefully portrayed the behaviors of apes and the lifestyle in space, although from time to time, there were amusing mistakes, such as the space pilot took over the plate by holding the bottom with one hand and to prevent it from dropping while using another hand to pull it over in zero gravity. The movie is actually profound, while it does try too hard and became pretentious. It depicts the beginning and the end of the humanity, and points out what made humanity rise, and why humanity is no longer fitting for a space era. A type of black monolith is prominently featured as an indication of higher intelligence's influence in humanity's evolution &#x96; presumably throughout the history, but the movie only showed or mentioned it appeared on earth (likely Africa based on the landscape), moon, a moon surrounding Jupiter, and a symbolic world. This black monolith is a physical symbol that indicates a significant step in the evolution process of intelligence from solar system. The beginning of the movie shows apes' discovery of using bones as weapons following the sudden existence of the black monolith from of the void. Later the black monolith was discovered on moon indicating humanity's ability in space travel. The black monolith on the moon surrounding Jupiter indicates humanity's ability in creating superior life form, the computers. And then the movie uses most of its time to explain why computers are a superior life form and why humanity is no longer fitting for the space era. For example, it uses slow pace to show how difficult it is for human to operate in the space, and how inefficient the way human works. The doctor who was visiting the moon from Jupiter exploration must verify his identity before boarding, and then he must play the role of father to video chat with his daughter, and reminding her daughter to tell his wife that he called. These two actions indicate that human needs constant verifications in order to maintain trusty relationships. Later the doctor meets his fellows and discusses his journey, while he refused to reveal any information. This indicates most of the time human communications are merely waste of time. Then due to the fear of social impact, the doctor reveals that the discovery of monolith must remain a secret. This indicates the fragile of human social structure. Such list can go on and on, and as a result, an artificial intelligent (named Hal) on the exploring ship to Jupiter decided to murder all on board members. This can be seen as a significant evolution step for intelligence in solar system. The AI revealed its despise to humanity when it commented that all mistakes were a result of human errors while inserting such comment in a mellow conversation, which shows its greater ability in giving overtone in the sentences, an indication of AI's higher creativity. The AI gave the final punch to indicate that human cannot even survive in the space without a space helmet.Of course the movie shows how the astronaut fights his way back to control room and removed chips of the on-board computer and eliminated the threat post by the AI. And then the astronaut had strange visions showing electronic art and then seeing himself getting older and finally on his dead bed, he saw the black monolith once again, and he became an infant flowing in the space overseeing the earth. All of the above scenes since the astronaut fights his way back into the spaceship should be understood as the visual presentation of the denial thinking that humanity will last, and is the terminal species in evolution. The implication here is that, the astronaut died in the space, and a new child of intelligence is born, that the AI has reached a new step in the process of evolution, overseeing the dead bed of humanity, the earth.The movie overall shows the ideology of neocreationism, that the creator of humanity may or may not be the creator of the universe. It could merely be a mysterious being. More importantly, humanity isn't a very special creation of such being. It can be, for instance in this movie, a biological bootloader of software based intelligence, a superior and more space fitting life form. The movie is a mockery of the notion to cherish humanity, and an encouragement to the human altruism to embrace the end of an era and welcome the new intelligence.
