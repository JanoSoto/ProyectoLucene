I've seen this movie dozens of times, and I never get tired of it. Forrest Gump is definitely one of my top five favorite movies of all-time.STORY Forrest Gump has a very simple, but yet an excellent plot. It basically follows a man named Forrest; Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), who grew up in Greenbow, Alabama and is sitting on a bench in Savannah, Georgia waiting for a bus. When strangers come and sit next to him, he tells his stories about his childhood, how he met the girl who he truly loved, Jenny (Robin Wright), when he joined the Army, when he went to the Vietnam War, and witnessing so many historical events (George Wallace's Standing in the Schoolhouse Door, the Watergate Scandal, etc.) that happened during his life.MY THOUGHTS Forrest Gump is one of those movies that have a bunch of genres in it. This movie is a comedy, a drama, a little bit of a romance, a history film, and war film. I thought they worked very well. The movie can make you laugh and cry.The visual effects, which were used to incorporate Tom Hanks into archived footage, I thought they were well-used. The cinematography is fantastic; the story is very well-written and well-told, and it keeps you interested the whole time. The music score by Alan Silvestri is one of the best score that I'd ever heard in a movie.This movie has a fantastic use of symbolism.Like I said before, Forrest Gump is the movie that changed my life. The reason for that is because it makes me experience the things in life in a very elaborate way. That's what one of the themes in Forrest Gump has to offer sticking with life.THE ACTING This movie truly has some of the best acting that I'd ever seen. Tom Hanks delivers the performance of a lifetime as the title character, Forrest Gump, the innocent and naive person, who's telling his stories to strangers about his life. I thought his narratives were well-told; his emotions are very believable. His delivery of his lines was just perfect. This is probably the best performance that I had ever seen from an actor. Robin Wright does fantastic playing Jenny, the girl who Forrest meets on the bus to go to school, and then they become very best friends. I really enjoyed Gary Sinise's supporting role as Lt. Dan Taylor, Forrest's officer in Vietnam. Sally Field was spectacular playing Forrest's mother, who raises Forrest after his father abandoned the family, and gives Forrest the meanings of life.IN CONCLUSION Forrest Gump is truly a fantastic movie, which is also one of my all-time favorite films.10\/10 (without a doubt) ","genre":null},{"date":"19 July 2012","score":"","review":" When I saw Forrest Gump for the very first time on TV, I immediately fell in love with it, and this is the movie that made me become more into film and made me change my life, and I'll explain why in a little bit.

The funny thing is that even sequels to these kinds of films, are welcomed with open arms by their previous viewers. Turned out I had the exact opposite feeling for this originally. Like most moviegoers, we like to see sequels with the same characters. Short Circuit 2 only provided two original characters from the first No. 5 and Ben. Before seeing the rest I didn't know what to expect and I wasn't sure if I would have liked it.Without reading any reviews, I noticed the approval rating for this film had decreased from that of its original. However, I also noticed that Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert thought it was better the first so it had to be given a shot. Surprisingly, I was satisfied more with this installment that I was with the first. The sequel to the first not only improves itself but also involves its characters more within the plot.Besides No.5, who now calls himself Johnny 5, being the main character, Newton Crosby's co-worker, Ben (Fisher Stevens) moves to the The Big City to try and make a living selling No.5 knock-off toys. Also trying to make a living is cheapskate speed talker, Fred Ritter (Michael McKean), who cops a deal with Ben to sell out his inventory so he can gain part of his profit. Fortunately, Johnny 5 is sent to them, from Crosby in Montana to help them get the job done.Stevens still plays a goofy Ben who still doesn't quite know how to speak correctly. McKean also has some comical moments due to his street smarts. I was amazed to find out he was the voice of Insaniac from Small Soldiers (1998). Johnny 5 is still the same; still speed-reads, still loves dancing, and is still constantly looking for input. Just like the first film, there is a love interest here. This time it is for Ben, her name is Sandy Banatoni played by Cynthia Gibb. I can't say Gibb gives anything for the movie character wise, but she is a nice addition to the cast. What impressed me even more was how the character of Ritter was given so much attention in character development. It was great to see him have a change of heart.The effects still look good even though they are obviously dated. The music, scored by Charles Fox, made me feel more during important scenes than Shire's in the first film and this made me appreciate it more. The comedy seems to be ramped out a little too. I got more laughs from the exchanges between McKean and Stevens than I did from the first with Stevens and Guttenburg. I can't compare Johnny 5 because he's the top character no matter what.However, what I really grabbed my attention here was how involved the characters became with being apart of something close to them. Johnny 5 wants to be accepted by everybody, Ben wants to be accepted by society and have a girlfriend, and Ritter wants to be successful (which I don't blame him for). And to see all these wants attained made me feel so warm inside that I was absolutely content to see such a well done sequel be released to the public.The next chapter of Johnny 5 not only has more laughs but the characters have much more attraction to them.

Whether it is panhandling to the same person (without even recognizing the person's face) or throwing a glass of water in a young Mexican boy's face for pestering him about buying a lottery ticket, Bogart's character is instantly recognized for being more than just disgruntled with society. He has every right to get angry when he is ripped off by boss Barton MacLane who hires him for a hard job then disappears without paying him. He's actually honest in spite of all this, beating MacLane up and taking only what is owed him rather than MacLane's entire bankroll. But when he agrees to go panning for gold with quietly moralistic Tim Holt and hyper grizzled old Walter Huston, his true nature comes out. The three all disagree on how much gold they want to collect before cashing it in, but when they come up with an agreement, Bogart's greed, previously just light, becomes paranoiac, and he begins to distrust his pals. Holt and Huston are basically decent men, but their malevolent nature is revealed when Bruce Bennett shows up and wants to get in on the action. Should they 1 Kill him? 2 Send him away and risk him reporting them for mining gold without a license? or 3 Include him in. They are about to do #1 when bandits show up and they realize they need him.This moralistic tale is confused as a western by some people even though it is set south of the American border. So if you want to call it a Mexican Western with its outdoorsy setting, bandits and grizzled nature, it is. But for some, it is much more than that. It could be compared to the 1995 film Se7en, focusing on one of those seven deadly sins. Each of the three men must face moralistic decisions concerning their own greed, and Holt faces temptation when Bogart is injured in a mining cave-in. One of the reason Holt is often overlooked in this film is that his performance is very quiet compared to Bogart and especially Huston. He is the most moralistic of the three, although Huston is certainly the most likable. From the moment you see Huston's grizzled old geezer, you can't help but adore him. He's a more realistic portrayal of the feisty old men Charles Chic Sale, George 'Gabby' Hayes and Walter Brennan played, a character who seems to have caffeine running through his veins rather than blood. Bogart is fascinating to watch as his paranoia increases. Alfonso Bedoya is scarily memorable as the head of the bandits, while Robert Blake (Baretta) is likable as the persistent Mexican kid.The film gives a varied portrayal of the Mexican natives whose lives are invaded by the three Americans. The bandits of course are presented as evil, not liked by their own people along with the Americans. These men are feared for their ruthless manner, first by robbing a train, then harassing some local villagers, and later attacking the American group. Then, there are the Mexican villagers who plea with the group to help them save a young boy unconscious after almost drowning.

These men are feared for their ruthless manner, first by robbing a train, then harassing some local villagers, and later attacking the American group. Then, there are the Mexican villagers who plea with the group to help them save a young boy unconscious after almost drowning. Their faith and traditions make an interesting twist in a film already riveting because of the theme.

I was expecting a quite light hearted story that was not too intense, it is rated PG after all but I was shocked. I must say this is the scariest film I have ever seen and I have seen quite a few films on peoples top 20 scariest.I am not going to review the overall film like I normally would because there are enough reviews on this film already about how brilliant the acting is (it really is) and how great the directing by Peter Weir is but I will discuss and get out everything I am feeling straight after watching this film. The story of this film, the first 30 minutes scared me so much, the eerie atmosphere that was created by the three girls and then the fat girl screaming when the other three girls wouldn't listen. Brrr... it was like the three girls were in a trance (which I believe they are) and the other fat girl is sensing something, she can see or feel something that is so horrifying that she cannot stay there any longer. The numerous searches on the rock are so tense and scary that I could hardly bear it and when the servant, I can't remember his name, found the man on the rock it made me jump so much. The way the fat girl describes her encounter of her teacher who is never found got visions in my head that stayed with me and it was so vivid, so horrifying. I am really not a fan of horror movies at all, in fact I generally hate them except for a select few, this was something else and it chilled me so much. So the first hour earns this film a 10\/10 but I am afraid that I found the last section of the film very boring and a bit pointless. I know that it was all meant to show the effect the whole incident had on the college and the town but this certainly did not make the whole atmosphere any scarier and certainly lightened the mood.To conclude, I would say that Picnic on Hanging Rock is nearly a masterpiece and the first hour is an experience I will never forget and it scared me so much. After watching this me and my dad discussed what maybe could have happened but every time we suggested something the other would come back and say how that could not be possible. The story is so scary and scarring and definitely would not be recommended to anyone who can get very easily scared.

Not because it's a masterpiece or some landmark achievement in cinema. I could be wrong, but I think this movie was largely both the death knell for a type of live-action filmmaking that had been synonymous with Disney for decades and the inspiration for the development of a sort of sub-studio system where films could be produced and marketed without having to put the Disney name on them. Of course, I could be wrong about all that. In which case, this would just be an example of the sort of Disneyfied storytelling that some people came to absolutely loathe.As the spaceship Palomino travels between the stars, it encounters an amazing phenomenon. The lost exploration and research vessel Cygnus is found balanced perfectly on the edge of a black hole, seemingly indifferent to gravity so powerful that even light itself cannot escape it. Captain Dan Holland (Robert Forester) agrees to check it out, though he's not happy at taking the risk. Dr. Kate McRae (Yvette Mimieux) hopes that her father, a member of the Cygnus' crew, has survived its 20 years missing. Journalist Harry Booth (Ernest Borgnine) is more interested in the famed leader of the Cygnus' mission, the brilliant and egocentric Hans Reinhardt (Maximilian Schell). Lieutenant Charlie Pizer (Joseph Bottoms) just wants something to shoot at, while Dr. Alex Durant (Anthony Perkins) is entranced at what the Cygnus' survival and current circumstance suggests.Joined by a hovering, spherical, maxim-quoting robot named Vincent (voiced by Roddy McDowall), the Palomino crew ventures onto the lost ship. They discover Hans Reinhardt is alive and planning to take a voyage into the black hole and the great unknown beyond. They also uncover what happened to the rest of the Cygnus' crew and find themselves facing off with Reinhardt's mechano-minion, Maximilian. Can they escape before Reinhardt's fateful journey? What exists beyond the event horizon of the most destructive force in the universe? Do really huge sets and matte paintings hold up against modern CGI wizardry?What you need to know about The Black Hole is that it is the one and only horror movie ever made with the Walt Disney name on it. There are some deeply disturbing things that go on in this motion picture. Or at least they were to me when I saw it in the theater as a kid. It may bear a PG rating but compared to the expectations the audience had for a Disney film at that time, they might as well have slapped an R on it. And it's not just the substance. The whole tone and look of this movie is dark and cold and creepy and some of the sound track reflects that.Some. Not all. The rest of the music of The Black Hole fits with the corny, cloying, clownish, family friendly elements that have been jammed into the film because the people making it didn't understand that it was something different than The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes or That Darn Cat. There are scenes here that are positively Jar Jar Binksian in their badly forced humor and awkwardly intrusive sentimentality.While the special effects are primitive, the sets and overall imagery of the movie remains fairly strong. It's kind of in between the futurism of 2001 A Space Odyssey and the stylized fantasy of TV's Star Trek, closer to the latter than the former. The Black Hole succeeds in being visually interesting on screen, something sci-fi flicks in the decades that followed often failed at due to a fetish for realism.Ernest Borgnine is good, like that's some sort of surprise. Anthony Perkins commits to his small role and pulls it off. Joseph Bottoms is energetic and that's about all, which still places him above Yvette Mimeiux, who can be distractingly wooden, and Robert Forester, who frequently looks like he doesn't know how he ended up in this kind of production. Maximilian Schell is artfully restrained for this sort of part but, again, he's playing a very un-Disneyifed villain here. There's nothing about Reinhardt that lightens or alleviates his cold, menacing insanity.As I mentioned, I saw this when it first came out as a child and I think I can remember there being a negative reaction to it from generations raised to expect a certain kind of live-action movie from Walt Disney. The Black Hole is not that kind. It falls so completely apart at the end and resorts to some badly staged action scenes, so I can't call this a good film.

It seems apropos that Hollywood's first stylish thriller with tongue planted firmly in cheek should come from director Alfred Hitchcock. We get two of the most iconic scenes in one film Cary Grant being targeted by a crop duster, and the chase across the faces of Mt Rushmore. That combined with the stellar writing of famed screenwriter Ernest Lehman (West Side Story, The Sound of Music) provide one the all-time most entertaining and beloved thrillers.Cary Grant plays Roger O Thornhill (the O stands for nothing), a Madison Avenue Advertising hotshot who gets mixed up in a wild case of mistaken identity that involves the CIA and an unnamed foreign intelligence agency. Spies who nab the wrong guy ... there's something funny about that, as long as you aren't the guy. The story is tied into the Cold War, but really the fun part of the film involves watching Thornhill maneuver his way through the maze with very little assistance. Well Eve Kendall (played by Eva Marie Saint) says she is helping, but it doesn't take long to figure out that she's no innocent bystander ... what blonde ever is innocent in a Hitchcock film? The bad guy is Vandamm, played with true menace by James Mason (whose wonderfully creepy voice always made him a terrific villain). His henchman is a young Martin Landau, whose mannerisms will have you raising an eyebrow throughout. While many rave about the scenes with Grant and Ms. Saint, my favorites involve Grant and Mason. Two suave masters going at each other with verbal sparring that stands up more than 50 years later.This was Hitchcock's only film for MGM, and I would argue it is his most visually stylish ... clothing, set decorations and the beautiful scenery and camera work. Of course, one can't help notice the poor gray suit that Grant wears through most of the film. It looks fabulous on him, even after he crawls out of the corn fields. Mr. Grant may be the most elegant actor to ever grace the silver screen. He moves like a dancer and has the face of model. This is a true movie star. I have often stated that he mastered the confounded grimace and the quick, sly smile and he built a career.Bernard Herrmann delivered yet another perfect score and Lehman's risqué' (for the times) dialogue is especially fun in the train's dining car. Finally getting to see this one on the big screen gave me a whole new appreciation for the crop dusting scene and Mt Rushmore. The scale of both segments is pure Hitchcock art. On a final note, there are so many character actors whom you will recognize throughout the film. Many went on to long careers in the 60's and 70's and even beyond. A true classic from the master.

This is a strange scene, as it just shows them as a pair of awful awful people, and the worst thing about it is the fact that Crystal is all oiled up and flexing his muscles.And then it's back to basics, Jimmy Smits is back on the street, and the guys must get him before the end of the film.We are then treated to a coupe of car chases, with a few one liners and an impressive final set piece.It's a shame i've seen this film quite a while after it was made, because I have seen so many buddy cop movies since and they have been a lot more slickly made and are a little more entertaining.That said, it's choc full of eighties cheese and Crystal and Hines are great together.

The story, of a simple farm boy from an isolated desert planet meeting his destiny as one of the brave souls fighting an evil intergalactic organization, is wonderful fantasy in a science-fiction setting.The mythology it creates ensures its staying power, as well as the many endearing and entertaining characters we meet along the way. There's the reckless, macho mercenary Han Solo who learns something about doing things for others rather than just himself, the wizened old warrior Ben \/ Obi-Wan Kenobi who instructs our young hero Luke on the ways of the Force, the young Princess Leia determined to right the wrongs being perpetrated in this universe, the loyal anthropoid spaceship co-pilot Chewbacca, the menacing bad ass that is the black garbed Darth Vader, and the odd couple robots R2-D2 and C-3PO who provide us with a healthy amount of comedy relief.The movie is cast to perfection, with old pros like Peter Cushing and Alec Guinness supporting the talented up and comers Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher. A team of technical wizards, who pioneered some ingenious special effects, bring us from one visually astounding environment to another, from the desert wastes of Tatooine to the stark efficiency of the armoured space station The Death Star. John Williams, the man behind some of the most instantly recognizable music scores of all time, supplies the iconic score here that lets us know, right from the first moments of the film, that we're in for a good time.Of course, those of us who have become extremely familiar with the film over time would give anything to once again be experiencing it for the first time, which is why it's a joy to see it as younger viewers are introduced to its sense of wonder. It's equal parts thrilling, suspenseful, and humorous, and gives us an effective final dogfight in space equivalent to that of an old time war movie.Just speaking personally, this has great resonance for me as it was one of those treasured films of my youth and one had better believe that I was a proud owner of a number of the toys.

Giving the impression that he didn't enlist out of fear, he's rejected by his love life Annabelle since she wouldn't marry a coward. That's for the context, the image comes right after. The rejected and inconsolable Johnnie sits on the locomotive's crossbar and doesn't notice the engine's movements. As The General starts moving, Johnnie is carried along and brought up and down in a series of poetic and harmonious arcs. It's a short moment but its memory in the History of Cinema is eternal, and if I ever had Top 10 greatest cinematic moments, I would include this one even though it doesn't feature any particular action.This iconic shot, probably the most defining of Keaton's career, illustrates the notion of loneliness in its most poetic force, something that creates a complete distance between you and the world that captures your soul and connects it to the unnoticeable movement of common banality. Johnnie is so sad that wherever the world goes, he wouldn't care. It's cinematic imagery at its best, and even most poignant to recall when you consider Buster Keaton's real-life discretion and solitude. It's like the soul of his comical genius speaking at this moment, he's calm, resigned, but nonetheless, he's still funny, but while we laugh, we share his sadness. But we laugh, because it's still a gag and the punch-line consists of him realizing he's getting into the tunnel carried by his train. As sad as he was, after all, he only lost one love of his life.This leads me to the second moment of the film, one that would surprise the readers, but it's significant because it establishes the two most important things in his life in such an explicit way, it wouldn't even have needed to be written.Indeed, it's perhaps one of the most famous definitions of a character. Johnnie Gray the Southern Civil engineer who has two loves in his life The General his dear locomotive AND Annabelle. Buster Keaton merges these two realities in one fantastic scene occurring in Annabelle's house. After getting rid of the two kids who solemnly followed him, Johnnie shyly gives a rectangular gift to Annabelle, it's a framed picture of him in the middle with The General in the background. The locomotive is so big that the picture contains only the top of Johnnie's body, but it's all in his expression, stone-faced would say some, Keatonesque, I prefer. I still don't know what the funniest thing is that he has the same deadpan expression in the picture than in the scene, that he thought it would please Annabelle or simply, its total randomness. I don't know, but I burst out laughing at that part.I laughed but there always was this frustrating hesitation when it came to Keaton's humor, unlike Chaplin, it's not a type of comedy straight-forwardly displayed. His face remains still and serene as if he never intended to make anyone laugh, which is funny already but with a sort of meta-referential dimension. Keaton tries to provoke some laughs in his direction yet he finds a way to remain above it, totally uncatchable lost somewhere between our perceptions and his intentions. The mystery of Buster Keaton adds to the fascination he inspires, and Johnnie Gray remains a mystery only defined by the two things he loves the most, and this parameter never changes. Indeed, Johnnie becomes a hero when his dear Locomotive is stolen, and what's more when Annabelle is accidentally taken by the Northern soldiers. Johnnie Gray doesn't fight for the South, but he's moved by his desire to take back what counts most in his life, if he's not a soldier, he's still one hell of a soldier.That leads us to my third favorite moment of the film, which had to be a stunt. If not the most spectacular one, it was dangerous and impressive enough to inspire the poster Johnnie Gray sits on the Locomotive's cowcatcher grabbing all the railroad ties the enemy threw on the track, he can lift only one but then he finds another one on the track, he can't stop the train. With a perfect timing and gracious harmony, he hit the second tie with the one on his arms making both fall outside the track, without hurting him on the head. The scene is the equivalent of the falling wall in Steamboat Bill Jr. and illustrates Buster Keaton's perfectionism and harmony in his approach to action. I was so impressed by that scene that I watched it three times in a row. It's a remarkable example of the level of perfectionism a true artist can reach if he's independent enough to take some risks without making an agent swallow a cigar, but which artist is not independent? This moment is also crucial to understand what an epic The General is, so exhilarating that I even hesitate to call it a comedy because I feel like the word diminishes it, but the film IS funny and it's one of the greatest cinematic accomplishments regarding its context and content , being able to provide excitement from a two-part chase between two trains until a spectacular and breath-taking climax is a credit to Keaton's inventiveness especially since it doesn't rely on special effects or use of stunt-men, everything is perfect AND flawless.The film didn't do quite well in the box-office, but I guess it shows how Keaton was ahead of its time. I, myself, even forgot I was watching an old movie and thought I was seeing a young Christopher Walken.
