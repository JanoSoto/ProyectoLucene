One must ask why. By changing the ending and adding characters that were not in the original, the American remake waters the whole thing down and ruins what had been the perfect ending of the original. Also, Keifer Sutherland was cast as the beleaguered hero and Jeff Bridges as the psychotic villain. Anyone see anything wrong here? Obviously, Sutherland would have been a more menacing villain and Bridges a more convincing nebbish of a good guy. As it is, Bridges plays the villain, a man who kidnapped Sutherland's girlfriend years before and now has come back for Sutherland, as a vaguely Dutch-accented loon with bad hair. Bridges has appeared in worse movies, such as the 1970s' remake of KING KONG, but he has never given a worse performance than he does here. He's creepy without being menacing, and you can almost hear him acting his little heart out. The film does have a moment or two of suspense, and there's a really funny moment when Bridges assures Sutherland's latest girlfriend, played by the plucky Nancy Travis, that he knows every inch of the woods around his cabin -- and then immediately stumbles. That supremely comic moment had to be intentional. Problem is, the rest of the movie is not a comedy. A young Sandra Bullock plays Sutherland's earlier girlfriend, the one who is kidnapped.

He has his own set, his supporting players, and reccurs through-out the movie. At no point is he upstaged or interrupted by the youthful players.But Elizabeth Montgomery's cameo was indulgent and bugged me then even as now.Eric Van Zipper was great then, and even now a delight. One of the mice is a quite pretty blonde called puss.. she's so serious- it plays well.Some-one mentioned musical book-numbers.. I thought that was kind of cool.. and the fun part- setting it up, moving from dialogue to song to number.. was there, while the bad part- the music itself- was mercifully truncated. It played fine by me.Speeding up the race scenes was something borrowed from the greats of silent film... and made fun something that might have been tedious..I'm reminded now of the courtship motorcycle ride with Annette and the male lead.. that Was tedious..Bonehead is a wonderful character actor.. loved the girl sent by the witch doctor.. the clumsey gag was good..I liked the way the race was previewed by the sabatour explaining to Van Zipper how it would go down, and then we recognize it, before it happens, and enjoy it more that way.

When released in 1998 cinema-goers were baffled by the film, with most viewers not being able to even gather an opinion. However, once the film was available for purchase a cult following began to emerge, which has given birth to the annual Lebowski Fest and a so-called religion named Dudeism. The world of Lebowski has become an element of modern pop-culture, while Jeff Bridge's character The Dude has developed into an icon of apathy. His days are spent bowling, drinking, experiencing occasional acid flashbacks and delving in pacifism.Conducting an exhaustingly (and intentionally) complex tale of a trophy wife's kidnapping, The Big Lebowski puts fourth a crime story as a means of making everything about the picture even more ludicrous than its characters. You see, the Coen Brothers routinely craft films concerning characters that have become swathed in absurdist situations. This is an ulterior motive; a means of clashing wacky diversities with an impelling sense of convolution. The Big Lebowski is about characters that are blissfully unaware of the complications which arouse due to their erratic behaviour. Jeff Bridge's protagonist The Dude (a.k.a. Jeffrey Lebowski) becomes apart of a kidnapping plot by accident. He unwittingly stumbles across the scheme after a contextual naming error, in which two house-breaking thugs urinate on his rug. In response The Dude seeks compensation from the intended victim who happens to carry the same name, hence the confusion. As you can see, I am rambling and could do with a Caucasian cocktail.The Big Lebowski has been apart of my life for many years now; I recall lapping up the dialogue to such an extent that I would unintentionally quote the film during everyday conversations and I still do. This boils down to a screenplay which will retain its status as one of the finest ever written. By no means is the script artificial or plagiarised, instead the breathtaking originality of it came as a breath of fresh air to the QT-laden dialogue which circulated throughout the independent cinema of the '90s. Exemplifying imagination and entertainment is the aim of The Big Lebowski; dumb, half-witted nonsense is not what the film illustrates, as some people have wrongly accused it of being. Oh, and I must not disregard a clear and present fact; Jeff Bridges offers one of the greatest performances of all-time.Do not dismiss this masterpiece as a senseless twaddle, as that would be an unfair accusation for such a multi-layered outing in confrontational, elaborate humour. This is comedy as an art form, and so is conducted on an ambitious scale of subtly intelligent, foul-mouthed wit. Except this is a farce crafted on a mesmerising scale of ingenuity and radiating charm. Characters like Walter Sobchak, Donny Kerabatsos, Jesus Quintana and of course the German nihilists are irrefutable creations of hypocritical hilarity. Throughout the picture The Dude encounters a vast array of sarcastically written characters, which are effectively caricatures of combined personalities. Stylistically, the film is crammed to the brim with stunning film-making procedures (e.g. the Jackie Treehorn section) which accentuate the confrontational wackiness of what could be hailed as a warped homage to film-noir. For a film of the '90s, the soundtrack is punctuated with retro rock & roll from forgotten eras and in essence identifies a hippy stance.It might be worth noting that this review is just my opinion, man. Even so, that should not stop you from viewing a film which is destined to be regarded as something not just of the '90s, but of today's culture, too.

In this movie there are four scary stories being told some written by Stephen King from his short stories and some written by Romero and SK. These stores, for that time, were pretty scary and freaked me out when they came in theaters. There are many great things about this movie that I enjoyed but there was, however, one huge things that I did not like about this movie. Regardless, it's about time for two horror geniuses to team up and do something good for a change.First off, the movie itself is about a comic book similar to Tails and the four stories in the movie come directly from the Creepshow comic books. The reason why that this idea works in not only the principle of bringing a comic book to life but the way it was shot, edited and lit. The camera angles had very defined and geometrical angels, similar to those that you would see in a comic book. The lighting when something horrible happens turns red, or if somebody is screaming the background turns to a shattered red background, thereby giving each scene a more comic book-like feel to visual picture. It had choppy edits and quick cuts, which we all know that comic books have. So we have a visual perspective of a comic, the overall pattern and texture of a comic and now we have the quick stimulus of a comic.Between each story there is a sub-story dealing with a young boy who finds the Creepshow comic book and how little by little he becomes more possessed by it. These intermissions also incorporate The Creep or our host for the evening. This character is by far the Crypt Keeper or the Vault Keeper to our mockup of Tales. Like the Crypt Keeper in the actual comic, he begins each segment with a scene setup and a conclusion, however he does not talk, he just blows around in the wind. With the beginning of each new story it starts out with a still scene of that story with heavy rotoscoping to make it look as if it is a comic book page, then fades out to a real-life still image and then begins. The same could be said about the ending. The clever technique gives the viewer a further illustration that this is a comic book come to life.Though this movie strikes it rich on my scare-o-meter there is just one thing that took me out of the movie just a little. I know what they where going at when they decided this concept and I understand it was a good idea but it doesn't work when it gets put on film. The campy one-liners, the cheesy sub-story and the lame screams. Of course its predecessor did the same thing, I don't think that it works as well on film as it does on paper. I think it was a nice try though.Overall I do believe that this is a horror\/parody classic and that many horror fans, if not cult horror fans, would like this movie for what it is. I certainly enjoyed it, even now; I recommend this movie to anybody who loves the zombie king and the horror king. A movie worth buying a ticket for.

These stores, for that time, were pretty scary and freaked me out when they came in theaters. There are many great things about this movie that I enjoyed but there was, however, one huge things that I did not like about this movie. Regardless, it's about time for two horror geniuses to team up and do something good for a change.First off, the movie itself is about a comic book similar to Tails and the four stories in the movie come directly from the Creepshow comic books. The reason why that this idea works in not only the principle of bringing a comic book to life but the way it was shot, edited and lit. The camera angles had very defined and geometrical angels, similar to those that you would see in a comic book. The lighting when something horrible happens turns red, or if somebody is screaming the background turns to a shattered red background, thereby giving each scene a more comic book-like feel to visual picture. It had choppy edits and quick cuts, which we all know that comic books have. So we have a visual perspective of a comic, the overall pattern and texture of a comic and now we have the quick stimulus of a comic.Between each story there is a sub-story dealing with a young boy who finds the Creepshow comic book and how little by little he becomes more possessed by it. These intermissions also incorporate The Creep or our host for the evening. This character is by far the Crypt Keeper or the Vault Keeper to our mockup of Tales. Like the Crypt Keeper in the actual comic, he begins each segment with a scene setup and a conclusion, however he does not talk, he just blows around in the wind. With the beginning of each new story it starts out with a still scene of that story with heavy rotoscoping to make it look as if it is a comic book page, then fades out to a real-life still image and then begins. The same could be said about the ending. The clever technique gives the viewer a further illustration that this is a comic book come to life.Though this movie strikes it rich on my scare-o-meter there is just one thing that took me out of the movie just a little. I know what they where going at when they decided this concept and I understand it was a good idea but it doesn't work when it gets put on film. The campy one-liners, the cheesy sub-story and the lame screams. Of course its predecessor did the same thing, I don't think that it works as well on film as it does on paper. I think it was a nice try though.Overall I do believe that this is a horror\/parody classic and that many horror fans, if not cult horror fans, would like this movie for what it is. I certainly enjoyed it, even now; I recommend this movie to anybody who loves the zombie king and the horror king. A movie worth buying a ticket for.

Don't get me wrong it really was a very good film but It had been hyped up so much that I thought it was going to become my favorite. The movie is about a young woman who is having an affair with a married man. The man she is having an affair with is not financially stable to be able to leave his wife and pay alimony. When her boss asks her to deposit 40,000 dollars in the bank for him she decides to take the money instead. She decides to drive to California from Arizona to meet him and start a life with him.Her journey there is very suspenseful, she gets followed by a police officer and you could tell that he's onto her. The police officer even follows her into a car dealership where she decides to trade in her car for a new one. At this point I am already jumping out of my seat because of the music that Hitchcock uses to follow the action in the movie. I can see why the soundtrack to the movie made it even better but I couldn't stand it! It was driving me nuts I had no idea when to expect something bad to happen, I guess it did its job because it sure had me at the edge of my seat.I guess the one thing that did bother me was the pace of the movie, I felt like it was just way too slow. Perhaps this is just because it was in black and white so it seemed a little duller and slow to me. When I was watching it I already knew to expect the shower scene to be the best scene of all. I was absolutely shocked that it happened so fast in the movie. This movie is very well known but the shower scene is infamous so for it to take place so early in the movie it really made me wonder where the movie was going to go next. It is the biggest turning point in the movie, but I have to say it didn't really scare me. Don't get me wrong I love the fact that it was not gory but I just didn't think it was very realistic. Im sure that is just because I have already seen so many movies that were brutally gruesome but considering that this one wasn't it definitely made its point without giving away the identity of the killer. The end of the movie was mind blowingly hilarious and terrifying all at the same time, I don't want to give the ending away but its definitely something that you don't see coming. The twist reminded me of the feeling I had when I watched the sixth sense, it was that good! Overall I have to say the movie was pretty good, the climax and twist definitely makes up for any other shortcomings that the film might have had. I just wish I had been around when it first came out, Im sure that I would have appreciated it a lot more.

The movie has everything anybody would want from a film like this. The best part is watching Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu literally kick the crap out of bad guys. Everything else in this film will not matter because after scenes like that, nothing in the film even matters. Throughout, you will forget it was based on the popular television showand just watch it like it was a newly conceived idea by Hollywood producers.If you want a hardcore plot, wrong movie. If you want meaning, wrong movie. If you want reality, wrong movie. Charlie's Angels has none of these qualities throughout the film, and that is what make it so amazing. In the film, people jump out of Boeing 747 jets at twenty-thousand feet and nobody dies. People jump of one hundred foot castles and live to tell the story. Buildings explode sending our heroes into a car windshield and they walk off without a scratch. These parts (even though they are very unreal) gave me the sense of what I call in your face action. The Angels do have a small purpose though in carrying out these beautiful scenes.The Angels, Natalie (Diaz), Alex (Liu) and Dylan (Barrymore), must rescue Eric Knox(Sam Rockwell) after being kidnapped. All signs point to Roger Corwin (Tim Curry), the villain in the film who the Angel's are highly suspicious of in stealing the new voice ID software developed by Knox himself. Along for the ride is a surprisingly not annoying Bill Murray as Bosley, who does prove his worth as both the character and actor. Also joining is Crispin Glover as the creepy thin man who loves pulling women's hair out and smelling it.

Even though they are unreal, the film makes the action scenes so great by having the same style as The Matrix. The slow-motion back flips and the half speed car chases give the action scenes that edge that keeps the audience on the edge of their seat.

Now it's time to share a few thoughts. First, Newman is always good...but this is different. This is no Slap Shot or The Sting Newman; he is perfect in his role as Galvin, and deserved the Oscar. I really can't think of a bad performance, or scene, in this film. If I had to pick one, I'd single out Lindsay Crouse...she always seems to come across as wooden...here she shows some emotion, but her timing and delivery take away from it. So, Paul Newman is at his best here, as is James Mason (a devilish best). The movie is about redemption, reward, conscience, power, money, The Church, the system...and how a hopeless lawyer somehow has his lightbulb moment...and against all odds does the right thing. That Lumet went with the original script\/screenplay makes one wonder what the OTHERS were like, but everything in this film, the story, the characters, the lighting, the underlying plot(s) come together to make one of those perfect movies. After 17 viewings the only bad thing I can say is that I felt the titling (though perfect in its sense of movement and delivery) could have been better (the Old English Script seems over-the-top). But even the TITLES demand watching...Newman nursing a beer, playing pinball, dark lighting, all we see and hear is Newman and the sound of the pinball machine as the opening credits roll...then we fade into the film. You've got to see this movie at least once; go back again and catch some of the other things going on. This is what film-making is all about; an excellent cast, script, and situation. They don't make them like this anymore (although The Shawshank Redemption comes close). I give this one 10 stars; it should be required viewing for aspiring attorneys so that they never lose the human side of things.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"16 October 2007","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" For a film with such a troubled production history, Tootsie emerges as a surprisingly polished, tightly plotted comedy. Despite numerous rewrites, a turnover in directors, and some off-screen conflicts between star Dustin Hoffman and director Sydney Pollack, its all the more remarkable that Tootsie is so successful.The film is like a well-oiled machine. Everything about it works. Right down the middle. From its inspired ensemble casting to its slick direction and witty script, Tootsie has endured for 25 years and is still going strong.Of all the films Dustin Hoffman has starred in, this surely must count as his finest. Perhaps because the character of Michael Dorsey so neatly captures aspects of Hoffman in real life.In the opening scenes, Michael is shown as an exacting method actor. He has tremendous range, an incredible variety of vocal chords, and a lot of interesting ideas. But they're ideas at odds with every director and co-star he works with.Michael may be a terrific actor, but he's rubbed a number of people up the wrong way through his constant critiquing and reinterpretations of the parts he's supposed to be playing. This has all given him a very bad reputation. And its gotten to the point where nobody in Hollywood will hire him.Now of course Dustin Hoffman has been constantly employed for the past 40 years. But everything else I said about Michael is pretty much the story of Hoffman's life. And its that key that allows Tootsie to flow as smoothly as it does.Hoffman must realise on some subconscious level he's playing a character not all that far removed from himself. And that's the genius of Tootsie. We already know and identify with Michael Dorsey, making it that much easier to go a further distance and identify with his alter ego, Dorothy Michaels.Michael hits on the idea if he can't get work as a man, maybe he can get work as a woman. So he invents Dorothy Michaels. A ballsy, brassy Southern belle with an acid tongue and opinions aplenty. And the ruse works! 'She' becomes the new hospital administrator on daytime TV's hottest soap opera, Southwest General.But what happens when Dorothy becomes an unexpected success? And the studio refuses to release Michael\/Dorothy from his\/her contract? The result? An hilariously madcap series of neverending complications! Tootsie is not the first film of course to tackle the themes of cross-dressing. But its every bit as accomplished as Some Like It Hot. Tootsie is a film I find very difficult to dislike. It's such a good natured film. And disarming in its ways. I've never met a single person who didn't find something to enjoy about Tootsie.The delights come from a wide variety of areas. Not only does Sydney Pollack's direction move at a marvellous gallop, but the wonderful cast breathes such life into an already witty screenplay. Its the efforts of everyone involved that gives Tootsie such spirit.Dustin Hoffman's performance is quite faultless. Not only does he excel as Michael, but he pulls out all the stops and turns Dorothy into a completely different person altogether. But its not just on Hoffman's shoulders. The rest of the cast do their part too.Tootsie has one of the most wonderful ensemble casts I've ever seen in a comedy. They all add something. And not a single actor is wasted. Jessica Lange turns in a nicely defined performance as Julie Nichols, Dorothy's co-star on Southwest General. The woman he falls for. Something that only adds more complications to Michael's life.Teri Garr does a wonderfully ditzy performance as Michael's neurotic girlfriend Sandy, who becomes more and more flustered by his increasingly odd behaviour.

Its not only an hilarious pileup of spiralling difficulties, but an extremely touching love story. Michael loves Julie, but she only sees Dorothy. There are many character arcs surrounding Hoffman and Lange, but they're relationship is the heart and soul of the picture. And everything converges beautifully in the final ten minutes. When Michael unmasks himself on live TV! And professes his love for Julie. His confession is not only sweet. But funny too.Tootsie is a true classic. It fires on every cylinder. Hits every target.

Despite numerous rewrites, a turnover in directors, and some off-screen conflicts between star Dustin Hoffman and director Sydney Pollack, its all the more remarkable that Tootsie is so successful.The film is like a well-oiled machine. Everything about it works. Right down the middle. From its inspired ensemble casting to its slick direction and witty script, Tootsie has endured for 25 years and is still going strong.Of all the films Dustin Hoffman has starred in, this surely must count as his finest. Perhaps because the character of Michael Dorsey so neatly captures aspects of Hoffman in real life.In the opening scenes, Michael is shown as an exacting method actor. He has tremendous range, an incredible variety of vocal chords, and a lot of interesting ideas. But they're ideas at odds with every director and co-star he works with.Michael may be a terrific actor, but he's rubbed a number of people up the wrong way through his constant critiquing and reinterpretations of the parts he's supposed to be playing. This has all given him a very bad reputation. And its gotten to the point where nobody in Hollywood will hire him.Now of course Dustin Hoffman has been constantly employed for the past 40 years. But everything else I said about Michael is pretty much the story of Hoffman's life. And its that key that allows Tootsie to flow as smoothly as it does.Hoffman must realise on some subconscious level he's playing a character not all that far removed from himself. And that's the genius of Tootsie. We already know and identify with Michael Dorsey, making it that much easier to go a further distance and identify with his alter ego, Dorothy Michaels.Michael hits on the idea if he can't get work as a man, maybe he can get work as a woman. So he invents Dorothy Michaels. A ballsy, brassy Southern belle with an acid tongue and opinions aplenty. And the ruse works! 'She' becomes the new hospital administrator on daytime TV's hottest soap opera, Southwest General.But what happens when Dorothy becomes an unexpected success? And the studio refuses to release Michael\/Dorothy from his\/her contract? The result? An hilariously madcap series of neverending complications! Tootsie is not the first film of course to tackle the themes of cross-dressing. But its every bit as accomplished as Some Like It Hot. Tootsie is a film I find very difficult to dislike. It's such a good natured film. And disarming in its ways. I've never met a single person who didn't find something to enjoy about Tootsie.The delights come from a wide variety of areas. Not only does Sydney Pollack's direction move at a marvellous gallop, but the wonderful cast breathes such life into an already witty screenplay. Its the efforts of everyone involved that gives Tootsie such spirit.Dustin Hoffman's performance is quite faultless. Not only does he excel as Michael, but he pulls out all the stops and turns Dorothy into a completely different person altogether. But its not just on Hoffman's shoulders. The rest of the cast do their part too.Tootsie has one of the most wonderful ensemble casts I've ever seen in a comedy. They all add something. And not a single actor is wasted.

I found it incredibly hard to take my eyes off the screen, even though the story has been done to death. Each vividly lush and fairy-tale engraved set piece is set-up, and I hungrily waited to analyse and soak-up this magnificent art form of symbolic and superstitious embellishment. Atmospheric, old fashion chills of the subtle, but still blood-curdling kind fill Herzog's stunningly protracted direction. The story is there, but it's the little details that sets this canvas in motion. The gloomy tone of the film is powerfully brooding from the air of growing despair, loneliness to the smothering stench of dark, lingering death. Kiniski sensationally emit's a sullen, heart-felt turn where he's shadowy exterior creeps up upon you and causes goose bumps. His make-up and body movement is simply trance-like, and stares you down. He's a scavenger, which goes after what he wants and not under any sort seductive appeal. A soulful Adjani is awe-inspiring, and gracefully evokes a versatile performance that also demands your attention. A quite dry Bruno Gaz does well, and an unforgettable Roland Topor as Dracula's loyal servant totally cackles like an on edge hyena.

I usually avoid Costa-Gavras because he is left-wing and I have no truck with left wing ideals and socialist\/commy doctrines. But, politics aside, this film is interesting plot and character-wise. I have read most of the comments from others on this and of course most of them are from left-wing liberals who rant on about racism and middle America etc etc. That was of course most predictable. The title of the film is Betrayed. And this is what is interesting. How Debra Winger, masquerading as a farmer manages to betray the kindness of Tom Berenger towards her. Little by little she enters into his private life and he is taken in by her. And it is very painful for him when she reveals her real identity. The film is very entertaining and there is never a dull moment. True, there are some violent and unsavoury scenes but these are not overdone. I have great admiration for the character of Tom Berenger - very sensitive to Debra Winger and a man of traditional family values, standing up to anyone he does not agree with, including Klu Klux Klan members and Nazis. His character is actually quite complex and while the liberals will predictably denounce him as a racist, it's actually a little more complicated than this. This is a typical European left wing liberal view of Americans and should not be taken too seriously by the Americans themselves. Indeed the most Obnoxious character in the film is not Berenger but Katie's FBI boss, Michael. I was really hoping this man would die during the film but alas it was not to be so.He was a really evil character who was using Katie for his own ends. In addition the actor playing him really had a mean face !! My main interest then in the film is the love relationship between Katie and Gary Simmonds as well as the tune the devil's right hand which is actually the French title of the film.

I am not sure why High Noon needed a right-wing riposte, because it has never seemed to me to be particularly left-wing. On a literal level it deals with a subject- the need for a strong stance on law and order- which has always been dear to the hearts of conservatives, and on a metaphorical level it would be just as easy to read a right-wing meaning into it as it would a left-wing one. (Given that the film was made during the Korean War, it would be easy to see Sheriff Kane as a symbol of America as the world's policeman, Frank Miller and his gang as Stalin, Mao and the other Communist leaders and the cowardly townspeople as the anti-war movement in the West). The received idea that the film is an allegory for McCarthyism has always struck me as a strained interpretation.It would appear, however, that what angered Howard Hawks and John Wayne about High Noon was not so much Zinnemann's views on McCarthyism but rather his implication that the citizens of Hadleyville are cowards for refusing to help Kane. This seems to have inspired the most direct reference to the earlier film in Rio Bravo. When it is suggested to John Wayne's Sheriff John T. Chance that he should round up a posse, he replies that asking amateurs to help him fight hardened professional gunmen would only give the villains more targets to shoot at. The inference is that Gary Cooper's character was wrong to ask the townsfolk to risk their lives on his behalf.The two films are, in fact, broadly similar in plot. Both concern a courageous and incorruptible Sheriff taking on a gang of dangerous villains who are threatening the peace of a whole community. (This basic plot was used in numerous other Westerns, such as Dodge City and Gunfight at the OK Corral). In Rio Bravo Chance has arrested a local hoodlum named Joe Burdette on suspicion of murder. Burdette's brother Nathan, a wealthy rancher, organises a gang of gunfighters to try and free him from the jail. Chance has to try and hold off the thugs for several days until the US Marshal arrives to take Joe to stand trial.His chances of doing so, however, seem slim, because his only assistance comes from his deputies, one of whom, Dude, is an alcoholic and the other, Stumpy, is a one-legged old man. (Was Dude the inspiration for Gene Wilder's character in Blazing Saddles?) Dude and Stumpy, however, find reserves of courage within themselves, and Chance recruits another volunteer, a young gunman named Colorado who has seen his boss murdered by the villains. Rio Bravo, in fact, is not simply an action film, but also a character study. One of its themes is the way in which the characters battle to overcome their problems- Stumpy's disability, Dude's alcoholism and, in Colorado's case, his initial moral cowardice and reluctance to assist.Colorado is played by Ricky Nelson, a teenage pop star of the period, who was brought in to try and attract a younger audience. He was, however, only seventeen when filming started, and seems far too young and callow for the role. If Chance was so concerned about avoiding innocent casualties, he would no doubt have sent such an inexperienced greenhorn back home to mother before the shooting started. Walter Brennan's Stumpy can seem a bit irritating, but with those exceptions the acting is mostly good. I am of the generation which always thinks of Angie Dickinson as the sexy older woman in Police Woman, so this film gave me the opportunity to see what she looked like as a sexy younger woman. (Very nice too). Chance is the sort of role which John Wayne excelled in portraying, but the best performance came from Dean Martin as Dude, a man who finds redemption for his past misdeeds. There is also a good cameo from John Wayne's close friend Ward Bond as Pat Wheeler, Colorado's murdered boss.The main difference between this film and High Noon is not one of politics but of style. High Noon is shot in real time and conveys an urgent sense of time rushing towards the final showdown; it also observes the Classical unity of action as well as that of time, with no digressions from the main plot. Rio Bravo is much more leisurely and spacious, running to nearly 2½ hours. Besides the main action there is also a subplot detailing Chance's burgeoning romance with Dickinson's character, a female card-sharp and good-time girl named Feathers, and plenty of comic relief involving Carlos the Mexican barman (who closely resembles Manuel in Fawlty Towers) and even Stumpy, who for all his bravery is often treated as a comic character. Of the two films, my preference is definitely for High Noon. Rio Bravo never drags, as there is always something going on to hold one's interest, but it lacks the gripping pacing which makes High Noon one of the most thrilling films ever made. (In my view it is perhaps the greatest Western ever). Hawks may have disagreed with Zinnemann over politics, but he could perhaps have learned something from him about film-making. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 October 2007","score":"7 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" Rio Bravo is sometimes described as a right-wing riposte to Fred Zinnemann's High Noon.
