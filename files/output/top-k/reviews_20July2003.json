The plot is a mix of spy thriller but the simple device that sparks most of the tension is the vanishing of Miss Froy &#150; not even where or who, but why?  The answer to that question plays out really well over the running time and is fun to watch it all fit into place.  Although I have seen it many times I still get the tension during Iris' frantic hunts for the woman that she increasingly doubts is real.Added to this mystery plot is a pitch perfect humour and lightness that keeps everything moving along well.  The script involves plenty of witty dialogue and the film does have enough of a mix to keep you amused when the plot is starting, or tense when the comic touch is dropped off.  Hitchcock directs well &#150; he uses the train well and manages to get a real sense of being hemmed in as Iris faces lies at every turn.The cast support the script well and are great to a man.

When he contracts AIDS he hides his illness and continues work.  When an important document goes missing and an important client only narrowly avoids ruin, the partners fire Beckett.  He however, suspects that they have fired him due to their discovery of his sexuality and his illness and approaches Joe Miller to represent him in a trial of unfair dismissal.I remember watching this film in the cinema in 1993 or so and I notice that it's relevance and impact has changed since then.  On the television in my house today (2003) I watch 6 Feet Under and The Shield, both of which have gay characters struggling with various aspects of their lives, while my wife watches Will & Grace featuring several openly gay characters.  I would argue that the latter doesn't make any positive contribution to the images of gay people, but certainly the latter two do.  So it is against this sort of thing that the film Philadelphia doesn't really stand up as well in terms of message.The plot allows the film to look at all the various things resulting from homosexuality and AIDS in a world where it is viewed by the majority as something to be abhorred.  One could argue that that society still exists but I think generally the Western world is more tolerant than it was in 93. Hence much of the message now sounds like the volume is up too loud - or that we are dumb and need the point laid out very slowly and carefully for us to understand, in fact it's almost using the words of Miller, `explain to me like I was a 6 year old'.  However I am being unfair because this had more relevance in 93 and needed that approach.  Some have said this film is too preachy, I don't think it is - I think it is just a little too slow and deliberate in making it's point to the point where it may feel overbearing.The film is refreshingly free of sentiment and `cry now' scenes.  Instead it is pretty free of clutter and allows for a look at the wider issues rather than this one man dying.  Not all questions are answered but certainly views are challenged - I just wonder whether these views are the majority now. It does go on a little long as a result, but only by 15 minutes or so.As a courtroom film it doesn't work - the case in question is pulled all over the place in order to allow the film to look at the issues.  This takes away any sense of courtroom fireworks (although they are still dramatic at points) as I doubted whether the defence would allow Miller to lead them down the paths the case takes.  The central story of Beckett is good but he is never allowed to be just a person -he is representing bigger things and thus, occasionally feels a little distant.I felt at the time Hanks got his Oscar for the nature of the role rather than his performance and I still feel that way.  I am glad he got it though as it was a brave role to take at the time.  More deserving I think was Washington, he played the more complex character and the more important to get right as he represents `the ordinary man' in this piece.  Support is good from names such as Robarts, Banderas and Steenburgen but it is Washington who really holds the film together and he who is the pivotal character rather than Andy.Overall this is a glossy Hollywood film that did well to take a difficult issue and present it in a reasonably balanced light.  Miller's homophobia and distaste for the sexual act works well as it allows us to follow him as he goes from seeing a sexuality or a disease and finally seeing the person behind it.  Not as relevant now as it was then this is still an OK film but will be watched less and less as time goes on.

He has returned for the funeral of his friend Tom Doniphon and takes the opportunity to talk to a journalist about the story that made him a legend and furthered his career &#150; the fact that he shot and killed violent outlaw Liberty Valance.  As he talks the changing times become clear and some truths behind the legend are revealed.The westerns of John Ford will normally have wider issues as their underlying themes and many other Westerns have used the idea of the Old West giving way for new things as their backdrop.  Here the main plot almost appears to take second place to that backdrop as the film is clearly more about the shift from a society solving problems with a gun, to a society controlled by laws and political structure.  The film does manage to bring out a good lead plot but it is the subplot or theme that is of more interest to Ford here.This split focus has negative impacts on the main story at times and slows it down a little too much, one example being the English class taken by Stoddard which seems to be more about trumpeting the constitution than developing the plot.  On the other hand it also serves to strengthen it by taking a fairly ordinary Western plot and adding layers to it.  Happily it does the latter much more than the former.  The hand-over between the old way (Doniphon) and the new way (Stoddard) is clearly done and is handled without underestimating the importance of the `old west' as the road to the new world.  Without this aspect I think the film would have been significantly lesser and wouldn't be held in the esteem it is today.In terms of the branding of this film as a classic I think it is fair.  I wouldn't put this film in my list of favourites but it is definitely a strong entry in the cannon of work from director Ford and star Wayne &#150; and those works definitely deserve the badge `classic'.The cast is strong and they mainly do well.  Marvin is a real presence as Valance as was required for him to pose a tangible threat alongside John Wayne.  Wayne is good and allows himself to be surpassed by time towards the end, in that he is seen to become obsolete in many ways and become a little bewildered by the world where his values are being left behind.  Stewart has to carry the majority of the message and thus has the harder job to do.  Some of his scenes are a little too heavy in the shouting and browbeating department but generally he is very effective.Overall this is a solidly good Western from a great team.  Visually I'm not sure if it would have looked better in Technicolor (although it would have given another way to contrast the present and the past) as the black and white is OK, albeit a little basic feeling.  The central plot is good and is held up well (and passed) by the theme of the changing culture of the west.  It is done with some sadness but does well to judge neither Stoddard or Doniphon or the times they represent.

The central plot is good and is held up well (and passed) by the theme of the changing culture of the west.  It is done with some sadness but does well to judge neither Stoddard or Doniphon or the times they represent. ","genre":"Western"},{"date":"20 July 2003","score":"6 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":"  Senator Ransom Stoddard returns with his wife to the small town where he first settled to practise law &#150; a small town in the violent, lawless mould of the Old West.  He has returned for the funeral of his friend Tom Doniphon and takes the opportunity to talk to a journalist about the story that made him a legend and furthered his career &#150; the fact that he shot and killed violent outlaw Liberty Valance.  As he talks the changing times become clear and some truths behind the legend are revealed.The westerns of John Ford will normally have wider issues as their underlying themes and many other Westerns have used the idea of the Old West giving way for new things as their backdrop.  Here the main plot almost appears to take second place to that backdrop as the film is clearly more about the shift from a society solving problems with a gun, to a society controlled by laws and political structure.  The film does manage to bring out a good lead plot but it is the subplot or theme that is of more interest to Ford here.This split focus has negative impacts on the main story at times and slows it down a little too much, one example being the English class taken by Stoddard which seems to be more about trumpeting the constitution than developing the plot.  On the other hand it also serves to strengthen it by taking a fairly ordinary Western plot and adding layers to it.  Happily it does the latter much more than the former.  The hand-over between the old way (Doniphon) and the new way (Stoddard) is clearly done and is handled without underestimating the importance of the `old west' as the road to the new world.  Without this aspect I think the film would have been significantly lesser and wouldn't be held in the esteem it is today.In terms of the branding of this film as a classic I think it is fair.  I wouldn't put this film in my list of favourites but it is definitely a strong entry in the cannon of work from director Ford and star Wayne &#150; and those works definitely deserve the badge `classic'.The cast is strong and they mainly do well.  Marvin is a real presence as Valance as was required for him to pose a tangible threat alongside John Wayne.  Wayne is good and allows himself to be surpassed by time towards the end, in that he is seen to become obsolete in many ways and become a little bewildered by the world where his values are being left behind.  Stewart has to carry the majority of the message and thus has the harder job to do.  Some of his scenes are a little too heavy in the shouting and browbeating department but generally he is very effective.Overall this is a solidly good Western from a great team.  Visually I'm not sure if it would have looked better in Technicolor (although it would have given another way to contrast the present and the past) as the black and white is OK, albeit a little basic feeling.

Its biggest asset is the acting from the leads on down to the smaller roles, there is not a single performance in the film that comes off as forced or ungenuine. Aniston's quiet desperation is a perfect foil for both Gyllenhaal's intense bipolarism and Reilly's clueless self-satisfaction; Nelson, whose character, Bubba, starts out seeming like a leering, sexist pig, allows the viewer to see Bubba's hidden depths, as a man who has spent his whole life watching his best friend get all of the things he's always wanted for himself--and quietly resents him for it; Zooey Deschanel provides the laughs as Cheryl, a fellow Retail Rodeo clerk who alleviates her boredom and dissatisfaction by tormenting her customers and boss with her sarcastic wit; and as the doomed Gwen, whose death provides the movie with one of its most pivotal moments, Deborah Rush exudes a cheeriness and optimism that endears her to the viewer, even as it gets on the nerves of the other characters in the film. Only film writer Mike White, who appears as security guard \/ Nazarene bible study leader Corny, hits a few wrong notes, playing his character as a stereotypical annoying bible-thumper who believes that even the biggest disasters are God's will and should be celebrated. One gets the feeling that he is trying to parody the stereotype, but if so, he falls well short of the goal. The smugness and self-righteousness of the character is enough to make the viewer cheer when he receives his rough (if somewhat undeserved) comeuppance in the end. In terms of writing and direction, the film is average. Usually, really good films do one of two things they either provide the viewer with an entertaining escape from the cares of their everyday lives, or they offer wisdom or some new observation about life. This film does neither. It is unrelenting in its depressive feel; even the glimmers of humor sprinkled throughout are derived from the characters' depression and loneliness. While it is good at conveying the story of one woman's attempt at breaking through the barriers of her life, it presents her, in the end, with a choice that is just as confining as the life she wants to escape she can either doom her character to a non-existence as mother and wife and retail clerk, or she can doom her character to a non-existence as mother and lover and fugitive from the law. Either way, she no longer retains her status as The Good Girl, because if she does stay, the news of her affair with her co-worker will haunt her forever; indeed, you get the feeling, in the end, that the only person in whose eyes she'll be elevated is the sarcastic Cheryl. The futility of life has been presented in other films before; the difference being, in this film, the viewer has actually been led to care deeply for this character, and wants to see her end up with something more. The fact that she doesn't--that she CAN'T--makes the viewer feel more than a little cheated. Despite this flaw, however, the script is heartfelt, and the characters (with the above-noted exception of Corny) so real that you feel like you know them intimately. Arteta's direction and pacing never lets the story slow down or become mired in its own quagmire of self-importance. Perhaps, if this film hadn't been touted as a comedy, then it wouldn't have been such a letdown to watch it and see it for what it really is a well-acted romantic drama about people headed for their own personal dead ends.

Naturally nobody believes that the doll murdered anybody (Andy's mother is now institutionalised for backing her son's story up in court) but they do believe that Andy was somehow disturbed by his Good Guy doll &#145;Chucky'. Rumours have floated about that the internal tape may have been changed. The company that makes the &#145;Good Guy' dolls have decided to reintroduce their product and to quell concerns over the dolls the doll containing the spirit of Charles Lee Ray, the notorious Lakeshore strangler, is manually re-assembled. Unfortunately the spirit of Charles aka Chucky is still resident and he once again resumes his quest to regain a human body, which puts the now fostered Andy in trouble once again.There's a little more bloodshed, a few more victims and more screen time for Chucky but all in all this movie is not particularly fulfilling. Fans of the original may be impressed by the extra screen time for the foul-mouthed, murdering toy Chucky, but on subsequent viewings the movie no longer stands up. The plot leaves a lot to be desired and the characters all seem rather wooden and unrealistic.

The guy that plays Alec Trevlyn in GoldenEye (I forget his characters name and the name of the actor but I'm sure you all know who i'm talking about) was one of the few who did exercise multiple levels of character and demonstrated internal conflict.

Golem projected a similar struggle, but at this point we (the movie goers and not the book readers) are unsure of weather he does succede in snuffing his desire. All the other members of the fellowship had their personalities shaped early on and their actions are becoming painfully predictable; espicially Frodo.Acting is often regarded as brilliant or stunning by the members of the cast. But as mentioned above, the hobbits, elves, men, wizards and so forth are not multilayerd. Superficial isn't the right word, but it's the first to come to mind.

William Blake arrives in a small town called Machine. He was promised a job there as a book-keeper. By the time he arrives, the job is already taken by someone else and Bill is alone again. He walks home a girl and spends the night with her. In the morning they get a visit from the ex-fianc√© of the girl and he and the girl die. William runs away but doesn't know the man was the son of the very important Mr. Dickinson. He's the owner of the metal industry and he sends a couple of the most feared assassins on their way to find William. In the meantime, William found help and guidance from an Indian named ...Nobody Dead Man is a good choice when you're in the mood for an evening of quality film. The filming in black and white certainly gives the right atmosphere to tell the story. But still, I wouldn't say it's one of the greatest movies out there. Above average, certainly...but definitely not a must-see ! Recommended for the cast and the original story. If you want to relax and not worry about anything..rent something else.

Any hour-long episode of any television Western has much more talent behind it. He may not have been a hack director, but it sure feels like a hack director was standing behind the camera during the movie's filming.

It shares many of the typical scenes you'd expect, but the differences are in the details. In the first scene we meet Mary (Lopez), she is running around - cool and in control complete with headset, code words and a veritable utility belt of supplies - trying to pull together all the participants so that a person's wedding goes off without a hitch. It's quite a production and Mary (a name surely based on the verb) tackles it as if she's coaching a Super Bowel team. In typical fashion of these movies our single hero is constantly being pushed into finding someone and getting married by friends and family. All her romantic endeavors have been losers. But getting past this stock stuff the movie injects some depth to the characters. I like the basic connection it makes with the wedding planner being a women desensitized to romance. She views love as a utilitarian part of her job, something to be used and constructed, despite or because she is surrounded by it constantly. Yet it never seems to find her. She starts to believe again when she meets Steve (Matthew McConaughey) when he pushes her out of the way of a speeding dumpster of death - an action that looks like it did more damage then the dumpster would have. One thing leads to another and the events line up for the two of them. Complications arise, but hilarity doesn't quite ensue because the movie is never really funny. It sounds like a standard romantic comedy plot complication when Steve turns out to be a groom in one of the weddings Mary is planning. It would have worked out better if the movie had set up beforehand how falling for a groom was the cardinal sin of wedding planning. It doesn't and as a result the movie doesn't feel as realized as it could be. I forgive it because the pairing of Mary and Steve works. Lopez and McConaughey have chemistry. Their characters are actually interesting - particularly Steve - and they bond over things like ballroom dancing and M&Ms. That likable chemistry propels the rest of the movie. This movie has it's head slightly above the pack because it does take some time with it's characters. Not just the leads but even perennial b***h Bridgette Wilson as Steve's bride-to-be is given some warmth and charm. The characters follow the line the story gives them, but when crunch time comes they open up and reveal a depth that most romantic comedies would plaster over with sugary coating. Big credit to the screenwriters and director Adam Shankman who appear to respect their audience. They don't just lay out absurd things and expect women to gobble them up because that's what the genera does. Like many modern romantic comedies WP is afraid to be it's own entity. Shankman is often calling to mind old fashioned love stories. He overlays the score pervasively through the movie to give the feeling of a classic, but more often it just sounds like a cartoon or a Disney Channel sitcom. The constant music is a little distracting at times and I feared Shankman was going to throw in sound effects to punctuate the action. Many of the supposed comedy set pieces our couple find themselves in hit the floor with a thud. Like a scene involving a male statue and superglue. It also has the standard race-to-stop-the-wedding finale, but that shouldn't be a spoiler. Maybe this is the decline of expectations after seeing such rock bottom genera entries as My Big Fat Greek Wedding and Two Weeks Notice, but I did like this one. It doesn't give us anything new, but it's charming and cute and won't insult it's audience. But, in the end I still wasn't fully satisfied.

As I recall, people have mention that The Godfather is the best crime film ever made, but I disagree; The Godfather was a film that showed the consequences of people in organize crime or in a organization, but not GoodFellas. GoodFellas shows the exciting sides of people in the mafia, where they would go to bars, dinners, and laugh at America and those who were inferior to them.GoodFellas is a story about a young Irishman name Henry Hill (played by Ray Liotta as the older version) who every night sees the mobsters hanging on the other side of the street where he sees them park their cars in the middle of the streets, play cards and play their music all night without anybody complaining. The leader of the mafia is Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino) who is reclusive towards the neighborhood, sure people have heard of him, but he doesn't like people watching him and yet Henry himself lies to his parents when he decides to work for Paul and his mafia and is finally notice in the neighborhood, though his father doesn't approve, his dad beats Henry a couple of times. But does that stop him? No.Years later, Henry grows up (Ray Liotta now) and is enjoying what he is actually doing. He steals and kills like the rest of the gangsters in order to make ends meat instead of working nine-to-five jobs for stupid paychecks.During the film we encounter a group of characters in the film that not only work for Henry, but also change the face in cinema history. Jimmy The Gent Conway (Robert De Niro) is the rebel that cheers for the bad guys in the movie and has been in jail when he was twelve for stealing. In the film, Henry narrates that Jimmy enjoys stealing and throughout the film, De Niro does make his presence where if you see his face, show him some respect. Another character in the film is Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) whose reputation is more than being in the mafia, but actually has a wild temper when somebody makes him mad. In one scene at a party, Tommy is embarrassed by the fact that the owner of the restaurant wants him to pay the tab of $7,000, and yet beats the hell out of the waiter proving that you can't mess with a crew of the mafia, no matter what the rank is.There's another character in the story that is also a narrator, and the character is Karen (Lorraine Bracco), who was pressure to go out with Henry on a double date so that way Tommy can bang the girl of his dreams. In one scene she is stood up by Henry and tells Tommy to go after her and after embarrassing Henry in front of the mafia on the streets, Karen goes out with Henry on a single date where she doesn't what he does. Later during the film, she finds out that he's in the mob and fears that she will lose him.A lot of things happen during the film; a made man is killed, Henry cheats on his wife and goes to jail, a money heist takes place, half of Jimmy's mafia gets whacked and a supporting character gets killed.With a great soundtrack and a great storyline, GoodFellas proves that cheering for the bad guys is a good thing after all.

He steals and kills like the rest of the gangsters in order to make ends meat instead of working nine-to-five jobs for stupid paychecks.During the film we encounter a group of characters in the film that not only work for Henry, but also change the face in cinema history. Jimmy The Gent Conway (Robert De Niro) is the rebel that cheers for the bad guys in the movie and has been in jail when he was twelve for stealing. In the film, Henry narrates that Jimmy enjoys stealing and throughout the film, De Niro does make his presence where if you see his face, show him some respect. Another character in the film is Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) whose reputation is more than being in the mafia, but actually has a wild temper when somebody makes him mad. In one scene at a party, Tommy is embarrassed by the fact that the owner of the restaurant wants him to pay the tab of $7,000, and yet beats the hell out of the waiter proving that you can't mess with a crew of the mafia, no matter what the rank is.There's another character in the story that is also a narrator, and the character is Karen (Lorraine Bracco), who was pressure to go out with Henry on a double date so that way Tommy can bang the girl of his dreams. In one scene she is stood up by Henry and tells Tommy to go after her and after embarrassing Henry in front of the mafia on the streets, Karen goes out with Henry on a single date where she doesn't what he does. Later during the film, she finds out that he's in the mob and fears that she will lose him.A lot of things happen during the film; a made man is killed, Henry cheats on his wife and goes to jail, a money heist takes place, half of Jimmy's mafia gets whacked and a supporting character gets killed.With a great soundtrack and a great storyline, GoodFellas proves that cheering for the bad guys is a good thing after all. ","genre":"Biography, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"20 July 2003","score":"","review":" As far back as I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster.I remember reading Roger Ebert's review of Gangs of New York and though his review of the film was biased, he mentions how GoodFellas was a classic in point of direction and of characters. As I recall, people have mention that The Godfather is the best crime film ever made, but I disagree; The Godfather was a film that showed the consequences of people in organize crime or in a organization, but not GoodFellas. GoodFellas shows the exciting sides of people in the mafia, where they would go to bars, dinners, and laugh at America and those who were inferior to them.GoodFellas is a story about a young Irishman name Henry Hill (played by Ray Liotta as the older version) who every night sees the mobsters hanging on the other side of the street where he sees them park their cars in the middle of the streets, play cards and play their music all night without anybody complaining. The leader of the mafia is Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino) who is reclusive towards the neighborhood, sure people have heard of him, but he doesn't like people watching him and yet Henry himself lies to his parents when he decides to work for Paul and his mafia and is finally notice in the neighborhood, though his father doesn't approve, his dad beats Henry a couple of times.

","genre":"Biography, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"20 July 2003","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  The movie's which Oliver Stone made in the 80's are his defining creations and are for me far more preferable than his psychedelic trips he produced in the 90's. Although they were commendable, they were work more reminiscent of Tarantino than Stone. He is a most capable storyteller creating characters that can interact grandly on the big screen. Stories made for the big screen must do justice to the stage that they grace and this means that they should question the society we live in and offer us a perspective on it designed to make us think and consider, to agree or disagree and of course to entertain at the same time. Stone meets these requirements considerably and does not disappoint with his story about Wall Street. Although not quite in the same class as his earlier creations such as Platoon, it is a most memorable movie producing some high class performances and of course a strong social message.The only flaw in his storytelling, although it is a flaw that makes for a more entertaining movie, is that the good and bad characters are always too good and too bad, that is, they are one dimensioned. Gekko seems to have no redeeming qualities and is hell bent at making a profit no matter what the human cost. He is depraved and believes that if he does not do what he does someone else will make the money. He is the embodiment all that is corrupt about Wall Street. Fox is a very naive stockbroker who is attracted to the success that Wall Street personifies and this makes him easy prey for Gekko who knows how to use people like this. For Bud, Gekko is all what Wall Street can do for those with the guts to go out and get it. The lack of character complexity is what drives the movie since it creates potential for conflict. The evil stockbroker who manipulates the young, naive one is the centre of conflict for the movie and the one that creates the most interest. Therefore Stone has created conflict by watering down character complexity and that is why the flaw is a strength.Douglas is phenomenal as Gekko. We only see his greed and self - serving nature. There is no inner conflict. His speeches are not emotionally driven, but are given in a cool, logical manner thus delivering to the audience a character that utterly believes he is right. His success and self - assurity easily wins over the green Fox who can only see the materialistic nature of success that Wall Street worships. Since Gekko has achieved success as defined by Wall Street, in the eyes of Fox this is the man to follow. As good as Douglas's performance was, it is still questionable whether it was deserving of an Oscar. Notwithstanding this fact, roles such as that of Gekko do however attract the attention of the Academy since these roles are high profile as far as audiences are concerned since they are the most entertaining.Other characters seem to justify Fox's impression of Wall Street. His boss wants results and when results are achieved he rises in status at his stockbroker firm. The non - performers are retrenched and Fox sees this as proof that Gekko is right - only the hungry survive. Fox's own father provides further justification for the path that he has chosen. His father has toiled for years as a worker at an airline and has scant materialism to show for it. His stoic righteousness is seen by Fox as the weakness that holds his father back.Hal Holbrook also adds to the moral dilemma that Fox faces by offering philosophical advice which Fox notes but does not heed. It is through this character that we can see that Fox is going to learn his lesson the hard way. He has the experience and his learned eyes have seen it before. Bud should have listened.Besides the conflict between Gekko and Fox, the conflict that takes second place for audience interest is between father and son. The father is the honest man who believes in staying pure and keeping sound social values. He does not want to become a pawn for the players in the system such as Gekko. Materialism is of secondary value for him and it is because of this that he can see that his son has fallen prey to the system. Gekko and his father are for Fox indicative of success and failure. Bud is attracted to the short term rewards and loses sight of the long term ramifications for his actions, something that a righteous man such as his father would never do. When Bud experiences the consequences of the unscrupulous dealings personally, it is too late to avoid the punishment that society has to hand out. This is the crux of the message that Stone delivers. Greed becomes all consuming and before you realise it, you have hurt others and invariably there is a price to pay.Charlie Sheen is well cast as Bud Fox. He comes across as too weak to stand up to Gekko or the system. His cheap salesman lines and boyish mannerisms do well to portray him as the rookie. The weak performance in the movie goes to Darryl Hannah. The ambitious dealers in a Stone movie always need the best woman to indicate their success and Hannah does not convince that she is a top catch - only her looks convince us that she is somebody above average.This movie relies on good performances and a solid script to entertain. There is no artistic sophistication or moving camera action - this is a story about the path that America is currently walking. The attention to stockbroker dialogue is evident and this enhances the messages integrity and therefore creates realism. This story, although dramatised, is what is as current today as it was then and is the moral dilemma that ambitious Americans face when chasing the American dream. Do so, but there could be a high price to pay.
