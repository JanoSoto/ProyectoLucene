This fantasy film is about a man, Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner), who buys a farm. Alongside with him is his wife, Anni Kinsella (Amy Madigan) and his daughter (Gaby Hoffman).SpoilersThe story starts as Ray buys a farm, his long term dream, and, at some point, starts hearing a strange voice in his crop field, that orders him to do several things. And, as he does those things, he is somewhat rewarded for his effort. The voice tells him to build the main character in this movie The Baseball Field. In fact, it is in this field (Field of Dreams), that the story mainly unfolds. On the field, he gets to know his all-time hero Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta). The second time the voice talks to him, he gets to know Terence Mann (James Earl Jones), the famous-controversial-and-fed-up-with-giving-advice-to-people type of person. Strangely he hears the voice too. As the story progresses, Ray and Terence develop a strange but strong relationship, which Archibald 'Moonlight' Graham (Burt Lancaster) strengthens even more. In the end it all makes sense, what the voice said, and what it really wanted Ray to do. All in a climax of joy and fantasy.End of SpoilersThe plot is enough for a good, traditional fantasy movie, with no special twists and surprises. Pretty straight-forward, actually. Kevin Costner, probably in his second best film (after 'Dances With Wolves') gives an average performance. James Earl Jones gives a fair performance, and Ray Liotta doesn't fade away from the screen, in other words, he's sufficient enough for his role. The direction is typical for this kind of movies, no special angles or symbolism in the way it was made, but why would it be necessary? It doesn't require it, right? Overall, good job by Phil Robinson.Concluding, I recommend 'Field of Dreams' for a family reunion, or for a rainy afternoon. It is not a masterpiece, but it is entertaining.

Waterworld also cost $75 million less than DMC. But because it has Johnny Depp in mascara the whole world loves it! Hypocrisy! With a lot of behind the scenes trouble (Reynolds walked off the film and Costner had to finish the final third of filming himself) and negative pre-release buzz, everyone expected Waterworld to fail. Boasting a budget of Â£175 million (the most expensive ever until Titanic 2 years later) it was sure to be a flop, especially with the snooty public and critics blasting it before its release. Then, the unthinkable happened.

Yes, but so are the POTC plots involving fish-men, giant squids and Orlando Bloom as anything remotely masculine. But you accepted that quite easily. So just, for a minute, believe that if the polar ice caps DID melt that the world WOULD be covered in water.

This version apparently restores several scenes that tie up loose ends and answers a lot of questions about how the this particular watery future works as well as revealing that Dryland is actually Mount Everest.

Evidently the aliens, while they were probing Earth for information had overlooked the fact that water does them irreparable harm.

My throat hurt, my wallet was empty and I ended up chatting to a drug addict at a bus-stop trying to sell me some petrol. Today, I watched Red Sonja and I can honestly say that I felt much better last night than I do right now. Brigitte Nielsen leads a bunch of ass-kicking warriors in various shapes and sizes to recover a green rock from some evil queen whose motives are never fully explained. Yep, it's that good.Red Sonja isn't in a genre known for great films until Peter Jackson came along with a certain Oscar-winning trilogy. In fact, the best swords-and-sorcery film I could think of before Lord Of The Rings was George Lucas's kiddie-friendly Willow. Perhaps, in view of this, one should go a little easy on this film. But I can't - it's poorly written, badly acted (with the exception of Paul Smith, who's just average) and dreadfully put together. The film is as convincing as an episode of the Flintstones, with costumes and scenery seemingly lifted straight outta Bedrock. Considering the comic-book source material, it is easy to forgive the various plot inconsistencies. Why Sonja insists on saving the most annoying kid, in this world or that one, is bewildering. His personality seems to flick from spoilt brat to polite gentleman at the flick of a switch. Schwarzenegger displays less charisma than a field full of cows and just goes through the motions, a perfect actor for his breakthrough role in The Terminator.It's simple to kick a film when you're down but the fact remains that this is not a good film, by any stretch of the imagination. When Nielsen mourns the death of her sister and Schwarzenegger tenderly places his hand on her shoulder to comfort her and then blurts out, in that distinctive Germanic accent, she's dead then you know you're in for a rough ride. A few smiles were raised at inappropriate points, such as the priestesses of a temple who, when sent plunging to their deaths in a hole in the ground, seemed to enjoy the experience - at least, judging from the orgasmic moans that seemed to echo around the place. If you have to watch an Eighties fantasy film that wasn't porn, watch Willow (but never take that as a ringing endorsement). For the real thing, take yourself to your local multiplex and show Peter Jackson what a great job he did with Lord Of The Rings. Trust me, 11 Oscars really does mean it's a great film - unlike bloody Titanic.

Yep, it's that good.Red Sonja isn't in a genre known for great films until Peter Jackson came along with a certain Oscar-winning trilogy. In fact, the best swords-and-sorcery film I could think of before Lord Of The Rings was George Lucas's kiddie-friendly Willow. Perhaps, in view of this, one should go a little easy on this film. But I can't - it's poorly written, badly acted (with the exception of Paul Smith, who's just average) and dreadfully put together. The film is as convincing as an episode of the Flintstones, with costumes and scenery seemingly lifted straight outta Bedrock. Considering the comic-book source material, it is easy to forgive the various plot inconsistencies. Why Sonja insists on saving the most annoying kid, in this world or that one, is bewildering. His personality seems to flick from spoilt brat to polite gentleman at the flick of a switch. Schwarzenegger displays less charisma than a field full of cows and just goes through the motions, a perfect actor for his breakthrough role in The Terminator.It's simple to kick a film when you're down but the fact remains that this is not a good film, by any stretch of the imagination. When Nielsen mourns the death of her sister and Schwarzenegger tenderly places his hand on her shoulder to comfort her and then blurts out, in that distinctive Germanic accent, she's dead then you know you're in for a rough ride. A few smiles were raised at inappropriate points, such as the priestesses of a temple who, when sent plunging to their deaths in a hole in the ground, seemed to enjoy the experience - at least, judging from the orgasmic moans that seemed to echo around the place. If you have to watch an Eighties fantasy film that wasn't porn, watch Willow (but never take that as a ringing endorsement). For the real thing, take yourself to your local multiplex and show Peter Jackson what a great job he did with Lord Of The Rings. Trust me, 11 Oscars really does mean it's a great film - unlike bloody Titanic.

She was so cool and did such an excellent job in her role, that still to this day I consider her to be the coolest teen in any 'teen movie'. Basic Plot Cameron (Levitt), a new student at Pagua high school, falls in love with a sophomore named Bianca Stradford (Oleynik). However, Bianca has a flirtatious crush on the most popular senior at school named, Joey (Keegan).  Cameron's sidekick Michael (Krumholtz)tells him, that Bianca is looking for someone to help her with French and Cameron decides that's how he'll ask her out on a date.Kat Stradford (Stiles) is Bianca's sister.  Totally opposite of Bianca, she is anti-social and is the most feminist high school senior you could ever meet.  Against boys, dances, and anything having to do with prepiness and silly fun, she swears off dating and finds herself being accepted to Sarah Lawrence a college across the country in hopes to get away from her father and the city she lives in.Bianca desperately wanting to date, is told by her father (Miller) that she will be allowed to date when her sister Kat does.  Desperate and not knowing how to get her sister to 'date for her', ends up asking Cameron, her new French tutor, to help her with her predicament. Enter Patrick (Ledger).  An outcast and rumored to have sold his kidneys on the black market for a new set of speakers, also attends Padgua high, and is unsuspecting of what will happen soon in his future.Cameron and Micheal decide that in order to make this work, they need a backer.  Someone who's stupid, but has money.  So they go to Joey, telling him that they know he likes Bianca, and they need him to pay Patrick a tidy sum, to have him date Kat, in order for him to date Bianca.  What Joey doesn't know, is that Cameron secretly plans to date Bianca, while he pays Patrick to take out Kat.It may sound like a very confusing movie.  But it is so funny, cleverly written, and not entirely true of American teenage culture, but pretty close.  The acting is wonderful and in my opinion nothing in the movie would have worked as well, without the people who played their characters.  As I said before I think that Stiles' portration of Kat Stradford was right on, and no one could have done it better. Her best role, more than certainly, and I love this movie so much!

The DVD has a very interesting extra, where Jet Li explains who he is. 'I sometimes play a hero, but I am not a hero. I sometimes play a villain but I am not a villain. I am just an ordinary person, just like everyone else.' This personalizes him, and for me makes watching his movies that much more interesting. He is very intelligent and has an excellent command of English, expressing himself very well. The movie itself is a first-rate action movie. Only a couple of times the out-of-control shooting seemed silly and excessive to me. Highly 'over-the-top'. But most of the story was very well told. Luc Besson co-wrote the screenplay and it has the look and feel of a Luc Besson movie, think 'Nikita' and 'Leon.' Shot entirely in Paris, the dialog is in English. Jet Li is masterful in his role as a top cop sent to Paris to help catch a Chinese drug lord doing business there, but things go off kilter right from the beginning as the French police are not what you'd like to find. Bridget Fonda is good as the street prostitute from America who just can't seem to escape her fate. All in all one of the better martial arts action movies I have seen.SPOILERS follow, for my own recollection, quit reading, OK!?

The surveillance cameras capture the murder, and are stopped to hide the police involvement. However, one tape was not stopped in time, later Li breaks in and gets it, so most of the rest of the movie is the corrupt police chasing and trying to kill Li.

Funny scene, he comes upon a police martial arts training in a large room, has to go through them, perhaps 20 of them, a most excellent martial arts fight ensues, when the police finally break into the room, they see bodies of trainees littered all over the room. There is action on a boat on the river, in a tunnel, under a bridge. In the end Li encounters the bad French cop who shoots him in the arm, but Li pulls out one of many needles on his wrist band, from behind inserts one in the cop's neck, which paralyzes him. 'What did you do to me?'

Most of the team wants to abandon the whole enterprise, but their leader is insistent.  After all, anything this well-guarded has to be worth a lot of money, right?At this point I'm thinking, where are the kids from Scream when you need them?  With their encyclopediac knowledge of horror films, they could have told these guys that anything this well-guarded a) contains some great, ancient evil and b) is probably not worth the effort of stealing when there are so many banks and convenience stores ripe for the picking.  But no, they make off with the coffin, and thus begins Dracula 2000, a silly and unimaginative modernization of Bram Stoker's novel.The coffin, of course, contains the grandaddy of all vampires himself, who wakes up during the flight from London to New Orleans and dines on the rest of the thieves.  Dracula is played by Gerard Butler in a manner that manages to avoid all of the menace, sensuality, power, and charm that various actors have brought to the role over the past century.  He spends his time stalking around and staring in a way that the women in the film apparently found irresistable, although I personally resisted it very easily.So Drac winds up walking the streets of New Orleans during Mardis Gras, because it is a sacred and ancient rule that any film which spends any amount of time in New Orleans must take place during Mardis Gras.  His ultimate prey is one Mary (Justine Waddell), a woman who dreams about him at night at works at Virgin Megastore during the day.  I would like to believe there was some sort of symbolism intended in having the heroine wear a t-shirt saying Virgin on it, but the product placement is so consistant and obtrusive that the effect is ruined.  Pursuing him is the owner of the antiques store, Van Helsing (Christopher Plummer), who initially claims to be the decendant of the guy who inspired the Bram Stoker character (or something like that) but is in fact the vampire hunter himself.  (How he's survived this long is a process I'd rather not get into right now.)  He's also Mary's father, which explains her dreams of blood but not much else. Van Helsing has a handsome assistant who is utterly useless apart from being someone to explain backstory to, and to make a rather flat romantic connection with Mary.Things proceed more or less the way you expect them to until the end, where Dracula 2000 reveals its one shred of originality.  Turns out Dracula is none other than Judas Iscariot, doomed to an undead existence after that whole business with the thirty pieces of silver and the kiss.  Frankly, I think worse things could have happened to him (the fate Dante envisioned for the most infamous of betrayers is particularly nasty), but never mind. This bit of information, presented in flashbacks that resemble those inspirational videos the Church of Latter-Day Saints advertises on cable, adds nothing to either Dracula's character or the story, and mainly just serves as a reason why vampires get so turned off by crosses when, say, a statue of Shiva doesn't faze them.  Anyway, Dracula tells off a gaudy neon crucifix before Mary hangs him off a building, where he bursts into flames as the sun rises.This being a modern horror film, the final scene is an obvious set-up for a sequel.

A set of rare stamps from the long defunct German Weimar Republic that are worth a kings ransom. We then soon get to see the ups and downs by the two in the movie to first obtain them and then fence them. Marcos' sister Anibal who works as a manager in a large hotel in Buenos Aires call her brother to help an old friend of his, Sandler, who collapsed in the lobby and to take him home.Arriving at the hotel with his friend Juan, Marcos finds old man Sandler is not only very sick but also excited about a guest staying at the hotel. Sandler also recognized Juan as the son of a person that he worked with years ago in forging money documents and stamps. Sandler tells the two con men that there's a guest in the hotel who is being deported to Venezuela within the next few days who's the multi-millionaire industrialist Vidal Gandolfo who also collect stamps for a hobby.Sandler goes on to tell the two con-men that he can counterfeit the famous Nine Queens stamps and sell them to Gandolfo and they all can split the take, which runs as high as half a million dollars. The three become involve with the scheme to first fool and then fleece Gandolfo of the money he'll be willing to pay for the stamps. What they didn't realize was just how many other persons will become involve with their plan that in the end will lead to one of the most surprising endings you'll ever see in a crime caper film. Ingenious story with a WOW ending that will keep you guessing all through the movie and won't let you down in the end. A very south, Argentina, of the border version of Treasure of the Sierra Madre film about greed and deception and what it does to people effected by it. Fine acting and direction with a top flight story makes The Nine Queens one of the best of it's kind. The movie is so good that it's really hard to write too much about it in fear of spoiling it for those who haven't seen it. All I can say is stay with it until the final credits are rolling up the screen and don't let it's slow pace for the first 45 or so minutes or so make you turn it off the movie more then makes up for it in the end.

I've read the books and seen the movies, and I would like to say that these are my favorite movies, and this one of the three. The acting is stupendous, the sets and costumes and props all artful and beautiful, the special effects unbelievable, the themes romantic and wonderful, and the scope epic and brilliant. The one thing that make this movie so great, though, is the cinimatography, especially as it pertaines to the New Zeland landscape. The world of Middle-Earth is brought to you in wonderful ways by Peter Jackson. You can sit back and marvel at how beautiful the entirety of this movie is. Every frame is honed with wonderfully contrasting colors and images. Every wideshot is so grand and detailed that I could watch them go on for hours and nt complain. This movie transports you to another world, and that's just what movies are meant to do.The reason I think this movie is the best of the three has three parts. The first is that this film has a single narrative, which is only deviated from briefly and at good moments. It is a road movie that basically follows only one character and his friends that are immediatly around him. The second two all follow three or four or five diffenent story lines, and while they do it well, they aren't as good as Fellowship because of it. The second part is the pace. The Two Towers sees the beginning of the war, meaning that it has not yet begun in Fellowship. There is more time for leisurely strolls through beautiful countryside and heroic exploits of a band of friends on a mission that gets lost later on due to the importance of what's going on. There is more time for Gandalf to impart words of wisdom unto Frodo. There is action, of course, but it is more controlled and therefore a bit more fun, though not as grand in scale. The action may be the only aspect of these movies that really gets better later on. The third part is that it is, in fact the beggining, and that means you get to see the motivation for why the main charectars fight later on. The Shire is the most beautiful place that I've ever seen in a movie, and made to look so envious that it's no wonder the hobbits (and Gandalf) are willing to fight and die later on to protect it. There is one sene near the beggining where Gandalf and Bilbo have a smoke outside just before a party. There's definatly no time for anything like that in the next two films, which makes it all the more special and intimate where it is. Things get tense and exciting later on, and that's great, but this chapter allows you to relax and enjoy the beautiful world of Middle-Earth, while also offering a taste of the action to come in Moria, which was the most exciting part of the books, and wonderfully translated to film, I thought.I am a huge fan of the books, and I don't agree with all the changes Jackson made from them, but I do respect and understand them. You can't translate a book directly into a movie because they are simply two different forms of media. Fellowship, however, has the fewest alterations, most of them being things left out, of the three, and I find that exceptable. The important part is that Jackson capture the spirit of Lord of the Rings, and I think he did that and more in a way that blows most movies completly away.I am also a huge fan of the extended version of this film. It is basically the same as the origanal version, only a little better. It adds senes in flawlessly, as if they were never meant to be taken out. It has six hours of bonus materials spread over two discs, and they are not at all boring, if you are at all a fan. It also has four feature length comentaries, which is a more generous offering of time and patience for the viewers then I have ever heard of in any movie. Everyone should buy the Fellowship of the Ring on DVD, and everyone who likes the movie should buy the extended edition.The big question in this movie was if Sir Ian McKellen could pull off being Gandalf, one of the most beloved literary characters of all time. I fell that he did a wonderful job, and is the acting highlight of the entire movie. Another noticable performance, though is Sean Bean, who brings wonderful depth to Boromir, and give one of the best death senes I've ever seen.Again, Fellowship is my all time favorite movie. A movie is comprised of many things, from acting to editing to music to sets and senery. All of them are not only wonderful in this movie, but blend wonderfully together. I give this film a full ten out of ten, which is something I hardly ever do. This is a great movie in almost every way.

As this is a populist work, then should it not be judged as such? Is the use of country and home scenes really a semiotic juxtaposition or just a mind numbingly obvious convention?Andrew Sarris suggests that Ford is an artist (the use of painted backdrops a statement rather than budgetary necessity) and that the use of jarringly obvious humour is there because the characters would be otherwise too excruciating to watch in their more serious pursuit. It seems that Ford is there as protector, wrapping the sensitive viewers in a ball of gung-ho cotton wool.

I watched this breathtaking movie last night not expecting much and coming away riddled with emotion.

This is what I wrote last night, 'I want to capture how I feel but I can't.  It is insurmountable to describe the union with that character.  The anaesthetising fear and uncontrollable emotion.  Beyond any scope of understanding, but a precipice so vast that maybe there just had to be some reaction, some feeling.  Because if there weren't, this immense event might go unnoticed.  But it leaves the breath ripped out of my lungs and an overload of confusion and chaos.  Far from dark nothings, flaming with burning colour, unsettling and nauseating.  Devastating.'The film seemed strange and endearing to me for the first hour or so and I found myself getting frustrated with the filming and the sound quality though I think it helped me to feel through Selma and the way her world must have felt so disjointed and confusing. Amazingly, I didn't find the movie boring even though it was slow, I found it visually stunning and really intriguingly filmed. I found myself completely drawn in as it started to progress and suddenly everything exploded into an overload of emotion.  I felt like I was being pushed to the back of the sofa with the energy and feeling coming from the actors, particularly Bjork (Selma).  She was just amazing in the shooting scene and David Morse (Bill) was also wonderful.  Their pain and angst was thrust into my own stomach and I felt their desperation and despair.  Both people reacted in completely unexpected ways to the situation but I wasn't shocked or disbelieving, I felt I was living in their worlds and experiencing their lives and dramas.  I felt completely physically gutted when Selma returned to find the money gone and I felt so much pain and anguish running through me as Bill begged to be killed and Selma fired shot after shot and, finally, her battering.  I was cringing and shying away and also filled with complete compassion for both characters and their inevitable endings. Bill wanted to die because of what he'd done to Selma and because of his false premonition of his loneliness.  He knew he'd done an evil thing and desperately wanted Selma to have the money back.  I wonder whether his wife would really have left him or whether she truly loved him, as Selma tried to persuade him. Instead, his pride and insecurity required him to beg for his death because he could not give up the money.  He was, in fact, trying to hold onto his emotional security and I pitied him so much for not realizing that he'd gotten it all wrong.All the way through the trial and when Selma was locked in her cell, I felt like my world was collapsing around me.  I felt as though I couldn't breathe.  I was her at that point.  It was my legs that were refusing to carry me and it was my body uncontrollably spasming and my mind whirring with thoughts and my heart aching with love and loss.  I found myself terrified of dying and of that final breath and violent fall.  I couldn't believe what was happening and I couldn't comprehend the pain and fear I felt. I was confused at my feelings because I had hoped I was more impartial to death.  Or, at least, felt I could cope and had little attachment to my life or the world, but when faced with the emotions and true feelings, I was terrified.  And I can't work out what I was so wildly scared of.  In fact, it worries me even more if I've become so attached to life that I feel a destroying passion to keep a hold of it.At the beginning of the film, I got a strong sense of Selma being very detatched and I spent a lot of the time wondering whether she was mentally or emotionally challenged in some way (that shows more than most people's emotional conflicts).  I found her character quite simple and it felt like she didn't understand a lot of what was going on around her and was protected by many members of the town.  It seemed a little too much to be wholly down to her ever diminishing eye-sight and more as though she were affected by Asperger Syndrome or something similar.The tag line for the movie is 'You don't need eyes to see' but I found this confusing as Selma was so desperate for her son to receive the operation, exclaiming, `No.  He needs his eyes!' when Kathy states that 'He needs his mother'.  For me, the tag line reflected the depth of feeling Selma was still entirely capable of without sight.  But, I would have liked for her to have some realization of this too.  This may well have been shown with her final song, `They think it's the last song, but they don't know us. It's only the last song if we let it be.'  I couldn't help coming away still completely shocked by the enormity of what had just happened and, much as I wanted to believe that it wasn't 'the last song', there was an air of finality.  The movie ended with me fearing the experience of that fear of violence and death and disappointed that maybe I'm not stronger or deeper after all.As I walked home, I felt gutted and distraught really.  I felt profoundly affected and sad.  It also made me recall a very different feeling two days ago on that very walk.  A feeling of complete elatedness and joy and permanence.  I thought I'd found the everlasting part of me and of the world and I was buzzing with the beauty and excitement and pure, orgasmic love of the world and it's creations.  I knew that that came from within me and felt that I could withstand any physical endurance because of this spark inside me.  However, now, I'm not sure that it would get me through that march. Those trembling legs and pleading wails.  It made me wonder, 'What is the difference between that orgasmic energy and this energy?'  When I tried to deconstruct each, they actually both contain amazingly similar characteristics.  Both energies feel like a rush of richness through my body.  Both make me want to exclaim and open my body up to the world and say, 'hey!'  But one is through pain, and the other through joy.  Both feel alive and electric and both feel like they are running so very deep.

I found her character quite simple and it felt like she didn't understand a lot of what was going on around her and was protected by many members of the town.  It seemed a little too much to be wholly down to her ever diminishing eye-sight and more as though she were affected by Asperger Syndrome or something similar.The tag line for the movie is 'You don't need eyes to see' but I found this confusing as Selma was so desperate for her son to receive the operation, exclaiming, `No.  He needs his eyes!' when Kathy states that 'He needs his mother'.  For me, the tag line reflected the depth of feeling Selma was still entirely capable of without sight.  But, I would have liked for her to have some realization of this too.  This may well have been shown with her final song, `They think it's the last song, but they don't know us. It's only the last song if we let it be.'  I couldn't help coming away still completely shocked by the enormity of what had just happened and, much as I wanted to believe that it wasn't 'the last song', there was an air of finality.  The movie ended with me fearing the experience of that fear of violence and death and disappointed that maybe I'm not stronger or deeper after all.As I walked home, I felt gutted and distraught really.  I felt profoundly affected and sad.  It also made me recall a very different feeling two days ago on that very walk.  A feeling of complete elatedness and joy and permanence.  I thought I'd found the everlasting part of me and of the world and I was buzzing with the beauty and excitement and pure, orgasmic love of the world and it's creations.  I knew that that came from within me and felt that I could withstand any physical endurance because of this spark inside me.  However, now, I'm not sure that it would get me through that march. Those trembling legs and pleading wails.  It made me wonder, 'What is the difference between that orgasmic energy and this energy?'  When I tried to deconstruct each, they actually both contain amazingly similar characteristics.  Both energies feel like a rush of richness through my body.  Both make me want to exclaim and open my body up to the world and say, 'hey!'  But one is through pain, and the other through joy.  Both feel alive and electric and both feel like they are running so very deep. ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Musical"},{"date":"6 March 2004","score":"","review":"  I've noticed that M. Night Shyamalan's movies tend to have a very mournful quality about them, and consistently are peopled with characters who've had a measure of life snatched away from them. His antagonists, and even the secondary characters, all seem to have something missing from their lives that aches at them. I had the pleasure of watching THE SIXTH SENSE for the first time only hours before seeing the director's follow-up UNBREAKABLE when it was first released theatrically. So for me the connection is very immediate and noticeable.Shyamalan is at his craftiest when he inverts a genre movie, which so far has been his hallmark. THE SIXTH SENSE was a ghost story, and SIGNS was an aliens-take-over-the-world story. By that line of comparison, UNBREAKABLE is a super-hero movie...but I think a viewer who gets caught up in such a summary is missing the heart of the film. Comic-books (a medium with a devoted but minimal following) are only the framework within which these characters get to explore very tangible issues.UNBREAKABLE unfolds at an admittedly liesurely pace, but I for one enjoyed that. It's not a traditional comic-book movie, and in my opinion has no need to pace itself like one. Shyamalan has a true storyteller's gift for staging and timing, and is able to make something as mundane as a character descending subway steps seem chilling and perilous. It's that slow burn-storytelling that makes such scenes pay off.It should also be noted that Shyamalan is great at drawing-out strong performances from children, and Spencer Treat Clark continues that trend in this film. Also, Samuel L. Jackson displays astonishing fragility in his role of Elijah (especially when contrasted with his title character in another film from the same year, SHAFT 2000).And the soundtrack by James Newton Howard pulses in much the same way as the actual movie does, building to its most notable crescendo during the train station sequence. It's understated and moody, but it resonates with something powerful beneath the surface, exactly like the story itself.Far more than a comic-book movie, and yet very much that. Real life doesn't fit neatly into square panels, and neither does this film...Shyamalan's streak remains unbroken. ","genre":null},{"date":"6 March 2004","score":"","review":"  I've noticed that M.

The film seems like a total bore to me, with its flat action sequences and still flatter acting by its lead, Harrison Ford. I have a hard time understanding Harrison's appeal as well. His expressions typically run the gamut from grimace to grim, and in The Fugitive he failed to stir a rooting interest in me--a crucial failure in a movie of this kind. To understand the difference, I think it would be prudent to revisit the original TV drama starring David Janssen. Janssen, a workmanlike, competent actor, evoked tremendous sympathy simply on the basis of his facial characteristics alone. Although the program followed a formulaic dramatic arc from episode to episode, viewers were able to closely identify with this wrongly accused Everyman who was forced to live on the fringes of society, always afraid, always on the run. For me, there is no such sense of identification with the Dr. Kimball of the movie remake.Apparently, U.S. Marshalls was intended as a sequel to `The Fugitive,' with Tommy Lee Jones reprising his role as Deputy Marshall Gerard. In my opinion, his character is better fleshed out here than it was previously. His humanity is much more apparent, and in this movie his sense of humor comes through with greater ease. Wesley Snipes plays the fugitive role this time, and once again, his character is falsely accused of a crime he did not commit. He goes on the lam, after the plane on which he is being transported crash lands and comes to rest, belly up, in a swamp. Snipes character is not as clearly innocent as Dr. Kimball was, adding a frisson to this movie that the first film lacked. In fact, the narrative of this movie is quite complex, including double and triple crosses, political chicanery in high places, and enough plausible plot twists to maintain interest throughout.The action sequences are improved here as well. It's apparent the producers wanted to take the stunt work so amply featured in `The Fugitive' and go it one better. So, where we had a spectacular train crash in the former, we have a spectacular plane crash in the latter. The major difference? The action sequences simply work better in the latter film. The plane crash for example, is an extremely exciting, well-executed, and entirely believable action sequence. What sets it apart from the train sequence in `The Fugitive' is that it is clearly a far more complex sequence to execute. After the sequence begins, you get the feeling it will go on forever, but you're mesmerized, glued to the action as if you were witnessing.well, witnessing a plane crash. Even the much-vaunted sequence within The Fugitive, where Dr, Kimball jumps from the dam spillway, is eclipsed here by Wesley Snipes rappelling from a rooftop onto the top of a moving train.And the producers also outdid themselves with their choice of an excellent cast to play the secondary characters. Robert Downey, Jr. holds his own as a Federal Agent, seconded to Deputy Gerard's team, and made to feel entirely unwelcome by his temporary boss. The movie also makes interesting use of the two women who play the friends and lovers of the two principals. Kate Nelligan, looking almost as incredibly beautiful as she did when she was a young woman, plays Deputy Gerard's boss, who also happens to be in love with him. This plot point is played down, but the emotions are true, believable, and well integrated into the action. And in a surprise bit of casting, Irene Jacob, one of France's most beautiful and capable actresses, plays the love interest of Wesley Snipes.I don't usually wax so enthusiastically about examples of the action\/thriller genre, but this is a successful realization of the type, and it seems to me it's gotten the short end of the stick in its unfavorable comparisons to `The Fugitive.' I know I would have never purposely watched this movie because I recalled the critical drubbing it got when it was first released. But the U.S. Marshalls DVD was bundled with the `Three Kings' DVD (a favorite film of mine), so I decided to give it at least 15 minutes of my time.
